B00004RF9I|5.0|This satire of Network TV seemed a bit far-fetched 25 years ago...but much of what was presented as satire back then has become reality on today's boob tube...One can't help but take a look at how the news was bastardized in this film, and compare it to the real life bastardization of network news into shows such as Jerry Springer, Network Morning news-talk shows and Cable News networks like MSNBC and CNN which present their personal bias as real news...<br />I can actually imagine someone like Dan Rather contemplating blowing his brains out for ratings  ala Howard Beale...
B0000640VO|1.0|What I wanted was to relax and enjoy a thoughtful French film, but felt confused and deceived by visual politics.<BR>But greatly relieved from reading comments with one star.  Yes, I'm not the only one who is critical, but I truly agree with the comments.<BR>Is this a film related with an idea such as POSTMODERNISM?<BR>Maybe the director's ambition (and competence) would be actualized more successfully in making advertisements but not telling a story.
B000065V1V|1.0|Bowie's newest is one of his least inspiring.  Bowie used to be proud of the fact that with each new record, he would start anew...and not be bound to what came before...but now, in his sedentary middle-age, he seems content in making a bad reproduction of how he thinks fans want him to sound...Unfortunately, Heathen sounds more like one of McCartney bad solo efforts (ie McCartney II)  than The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust!  Bring back TIN MACHINE!!!

6305508550|1.0|...  Although this movie has a few moments that will bring a smile to your face (the same kind of smile you get as you pass gas), it is certainly not among the best comedic efforts of all time-.......<br />A much better film in the same vein would be Bruce Robinson's HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING &lt;Criterion Collection>(Executively produced by George Harrison)...<br />Even some episodes of the Drew Carey show, and the old Mary Tyler Moore TV Series are better than this film!

0553213105|5.0|**** UPDATED September 30, 2012 (edited here. Extended comment at bottom) ********<br /><br />Pros: A great heroine and romantic story.<br />Cons: The language can be a struggle in the beginning.<br />The Bottom Line: The heroine of the story, Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my top 10 favorites.<br /><br />The story:<br />A young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, is the second eldest of five girls (no boys as the heir). She is a very realistic woman who doesn't believe that beauty or wealth should hinder her from a happy life and marriage. While her sisters give their hearts out to people too quickly. The mother allows all five girls to be \\"out\\" (allowed to find suitors) due to her fears. She is worried that when her husband dies they will be destitute - which is true at the times lifestyle.<br /><br />Elizabeth takes her time in finding her ideal man. She is very proud of her family and prejudice toward the wealthy. Lydia and Kittie (two youngest sisters) are hilarious, and they believe in love at first site of a navy sailor. This doesn't go so well for one of them - i.e. a Mr. Wickham. Mary is the unfortunate middle child whom is neither gifted in \\"the arts\\" nor with words. Jane and Lizzie (Elizabeth), the older two sisters, are more reserved with their hearts. Mr. Darcy also is prejudice and proud, especially when he tries to ruin Jane and Mr. Bingley's relationship. His reasons is that he doesn't see Jane's love towards his friend. The connected relationships all fit perfectly together.  Jane Austen shows a new ideal marriage when Mr. Bennet intends to marry off his daughters only if their mate was equal to them - meaning that the marriages should be equal.<br /><br />The language:<br />It's a little difficult to read at first, and my only suggestion is that you should remember that it was written before our time. Most of the words are in the dictionary, but the grammar has definitely changed over the century. Jane Austen also enjoys excessively writing about one subject in the story, which can be difficult to sit through to read. But it still shows that Jane is a great author, especially during her time.<br /><br />My thoughts on the book besides the ones that I've already given is that the book is one of my favorite Austen books, because it has a strong heroine character that I can relate to. The family values are very modern, but yet it also gives a feminist-like style when the characters like Elizabeth are intelligent, and aren't too afraid to speak their mind. This book is a great classics book that I have read numerous times, and am still interested in reading in the future.<br /><br />cheers<br />michelle (2002)<br /><br />******UPDATE********<br /><br />So 10 years later and after an excessive amount of writing and reading classes, I feel this needs an update.<br /><br />Austen's writing is always a woman's point of view. It's beautifully written with rich characters so that you always feel like you're apart of the story. Austen's fan base is more popular with woman rather than the macho man because she expresses feelings. Her characters communicate to each other rather than shut their feelings away. In the case of 'Pride and Prejudice' these feelings spoken won't always help the character due to either their pride or prejudice.<br /><br />In my experience men are not keen to the idea of talking about how they feel. Austen not only shows this but she allowed woman of her era to have a voice - even if it wasn't etiquette. So men, you should just bear through all the woman talk. And when reading through their blabbering, think about their behavior. Are they childish (I.e. Lydia and Kitty)? Are they behaving with etiquette?<br /><br />The romance in this book is genuine. I can't help but wish for a Mr. Darcy for myself. Austen did a good job in \\"showing\\" us her characters love - rather than today's authors whom \\"tell.\\" This is the example of show your feelings rather than verbally giving them untill our heads are bashed in.the story, which can be difficult to sit through to read.

0871137380|5.0|This book is superbly written, and one quickly gets the idea that the author really did his research.  My only complaint: the author tells parts of the story from the Somali fighter point-of-view, without pointing out how they were wrong for killing our men, or using their non-combatants (women,old guys,...) as shields.
B0000508U6|5.0|I would have bought this album for the deeply melodic, &quot;High Speed&quot; alone, which is hardly ever mentioned in other people's reviews.  And yes, Shiver, Yellow, Trouble, Don't Panic, and pretty much everything else rise far above most current rock songs, both for their melodic layering and for their original and relevant lyrical content.  As I've heard other people say, some stuff on this album can make you cry.
B000066F6H|3.0|How can you not a like band with a frontman who says to a live audience, \\"This place is beautiful.  You are all beautiful.  But it stinks of s#!t\\"?  Now that's rawk star attitude, and the Hives have plenty in supply.  It's practically all they have to go by, since their debut album is less than half an hour long (what else do they play live, or do they just preen for an extra 30 minutes?).  But that half an hour is raucous one, with songs that deftly mix old-school punk, New Wave, and garage rock into a nice little nugget.  The best of the bunch is \\"Hate to Say I Told You So,\\" which is pretty much a perfect song in every way, taking one hell of a riff and pounding it out until you bleed.  <br />An album this short shouldn't have filler, but it does (\\"Find Another Girl\\").  And \\"Statecontrol\\" sounds pretty much the same as \\"Outsmarted.\\"  Still, the single and songs like \\"Die, All Right!\\" are more than enough reason to justify purchase and repeated listening.  And the sheer hedonism of it all makes the Hives awfully hard to resist.  They won't save rock, but they'll milk for all it's worth.
0451527046|5.0|This one will capture the imagination of every young boy.  I've read it twice and may read it again.  <br />This story is like Robinson Crusoe or like Macbeth:  It is a classic that will never be forgotten or become outdated.<br />--George Stancliffe
B00005JL0I|5.0|This movie is perhpas one of ht efunnieset parodies i have ever seen, with the exception of all of Mel Brooks films(i.e. Spaceballs).  With its incredibly weird plot( i think the main plot was of woody allen trying to kill all the worlds men and hypnotize the women to only love 4 ft or somehting men, but other things intrude along the way including bond stopping at a scottish castle thing which is incredible hilarious), all-star cast( who better to play Bond than David Niven) and great jokes, puns, etc.  this movie is better than the Austin Powers ones( how i hte to say it but its true)  A must by for anyone who is a fan of James Bond parodies or any really funny spoof.
B000067CPX|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this album. It has great musicianship in it. BUT! it is too soft, cmon The Peppers make great rock songs, why are they wasting so much time on ballads. BSSM and Californician had a perfect mixture of rock and ballad. While I love &quot;Midnight&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, &quot;Dosed&quot;, &quot;On Mercury&quot; and of course the title track which is the only rock song on the album. &quot;By the Way&quot; is the only thing other then maybe OLP, Incubus, Weezer, and System OTD worth listening to on the radio now. Red Hot Chili Peppers still are a great band to listen to and continue to produce Grammy worthy albums, his album is sensational, but it just isn't BSSM and Californiacation. I guess I just don't blame them. I recommend this album to people who truely do love music and not what is popular, cause this album doesn't have very many radio freindly songs.
B00001PE4D|5.0|My skepticism was put aside on this one.I admit I saw \\"Not Another Teen Movie\\" first,and Amazon said I would like it.It's a great film with incredible dialogue,surprise ending,and well done acting.<BR> The plot is over 110 years old-but putting the 90's spin on it with these performers...I consider this \\"War of the Roses .5\\"<BR> Do not skip this for the teen demographic-this is a very good film.Anything more would be spoiling-BUY IT!
B00000GAIW|5.0|It's fair to say that Ian Anderson was the heart and soul of Jethro Tull but the band was the essense of the music. Martin Barres guitar work was prominent with Tulls sound and it was when I heard them perform live in Edmonton back in the mid- seventies that I appreciated the bands total work on stage. It was Aqualung, Thick as a Brick and Passion Play that came out of that tour and all the time, Ian co-ordinated  the concert in a conductors fashion, much the same way Jagger would with the Stones. <BR>     Aqualung is the true coming of age for Jethro Tull in that all the stories in the songs were like a renisance of time. Anderson had little difficuty telling stories with-in the music and blended the arrangements quite well. My favorites include the title song along with &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot;, &quot;My God&quot;, &quot;Hymn 43&quot;and &quot;Wind Up&quot;. The CD has bonus tracks which I feel were added to increase the awareness of more music (although the songs are good, they lack the original format that made the album such a listening treat). Still I feel that along with Stand Up and Benefit, Jethro Tull was the definitive alternate rock and roll group of the 70's. Pink Floyd was the only other group that made the attempt to branch out of the norm and make a splash with being diverse. Buy this and enjoy the ride. It's destined to be a classic
0671027344|5.0|I rarely read adolescent fiction, but this one really got me.  I think Chbosky did an remarkable job of covering all of the touchy adolescent bases without making his motivations too obvoious or cliched.  <BR>Charlie, the disturbed 14 year old main character, is endearing and I appreciated how his point of view differed from \\"reality\\" and how the other cast of characters see things.  Chbosky did a great job with the language and putting dialogue into the letters.  <BR>I highly recommend this book.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is not a movie that you can completely understand after one viewing.  It has so many layers that you'll discover something new each time you watch it.  Often ignored is it's strong connection to the gnostic worldview:  Perhaps we live in a world that's only a dream and need a savior to show us what is real.  That's what Neo discovers in his search for the meaning of the Matrix.  He discovers that he and the rest of humanity have been plugged into the Matrix and have been dreaming rather than truly living.  The question is, &quot;Is Neo &quot;the one&quot; that can lead them from their computer-generated dream world to the real world?&quot;  The movie is entertaining without an understanding of Gnosticism, but is absolutely intriguing with insight into story within the story.
6305165912|5.0|Enter The Big Lebowski, a completely ridiculous and off-the-wall film that does wonders getting me out of my depression phases. Starring Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowksi and John Goodman as Walter the Vietnam veteran, it's one of those movies that doesn't have any 'cry laughing' scenes, but instead goes for a steady diet of chuckle-type humor. You won't be rolling around laughing for hours after a joke, you'll usually have to think about it for a second and then chuckle when you get it. Call me a tool, but I much prefer it when you have to think about a joke, as opposed to it being placed right in your lap. <br />From what I've heard, The Big Lebowski was a box-office [hit], although I can't even really recall when it would have been in theatres. Of course, every once in awhile, a movie bombs, even when it shouldn't. I'm hard-pressed for an example right now, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it. <br />The story is completely inane and ridiculous - great stuff for a good comedy. Jeffrey Lebowski - or 'The Dude' as most people call him - comes home from doing his grocery shopping only to discover that a couple of thugs have broken into his house claiming that Lebowski owes them some cash. They trash the house, dunk The Dude's head into the toilet bowl, and one of the thugs even makes the unfortunate mistake of urinating on The Dude's rug - the rug that really tied the room together. Big mistake. <br />After a discussion with his bowling buds, he searches out and finds the other Lebowski in town (who just happens to be a wheelchair-bound multi-millionaire), an argument ensues between the two, and The Dude leaves, a stolen carpet in hand. From there, the movie just gets even wackier. The millionaire Lebowski's 19-year-old wife Bunny is kidnapped, and The Dude is enlisted to get her back by delivering ransom money to the kidnappers. <br />All the while, he manages to not miss his bowling night or his frequent LSD flashbacks. The dialogue between the Dude and his bowling buddies (Goodman as Walter and Steve Buscemi as Donny) is some of the funniest in the film, and these scenes help to tie the story together so that it makes some semblance of sense. They even feature a pedophile bowler that goes by the name of 'The Jesus.' Uproarious stuff. Walter switches the briefcase with the million dollars with a briefcase filled with his own underwear. Unfortunately, after delivering the fake briefcase, The Dude's car, and the million dollars still in it, get stolen. <br />This leads into even more creative dialogue scenes - the conversation between the police and The Dude as he reports the car missing is particularly funny, as are his conversations with Lebowski's daughter,the president of a multi-million dollar porn empire, and a group of German nihilists (watch for Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing the third German nihilist). And The Dude even ends up getting laid! Just try to tell me that his movie doesn't have everything! <br />The entire film is told from the eyes of 'The Stranger,' a man that The Dude meets twice while bowling - a beer-drinking cowboy. <br />The cinematography is excellent - the use of varying camera angles helps to convey certain feelings. There's even a shot from a camera within a spinning bowling ball. The Dude's LSD flashback scenes were particularly well thought out - colourful and featuring well-chosen background music. <br />If you're looking for some absolutely hilarious slapstick, gross-out humour, I can gaurantee that you won't find it here. But if you're looking for a comedy film that relies heavily on comedic, intelligent dialogue and visuals, then The Big Lebowski is a keeper for you. Check it out, but make sure you watch it more than once. Otherwise you might just be left scratching your head.

B00005YXZH|5.0|Why are so many people so protective of bands that they like?  So often people say, &quot;'YHF' is no 'Being There.'&quot;  Well, of course it's not.  This isn't alt-country and it's not the same Wilco that you listened to in '98.  Get over it.  This album is even better.  It takes those alt-country roots (notice the acoustic guitar driving most of the songs, the pedal steel, the violin) and adds layers and layers of orchestration over these bare esentials.  Here Jeff Tweedy and company paint over fine pop songs (see a Tweedy solo show to hear these songs at their most bare, awesome pop level) with a masterpiece of sound.  <br />The album leads off with &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.&quot;  It'll give you chills the first time you hear it that won't let up (except for during the forgetable &quot;Radio Cure&quot;) until Wilco closes out the album with &quot;Reservations.&quot;<br />What makes this a masterpiece is that it moves music ahead.  The point is that it's not a pop album like &quot;Summerteeth&quot; and it's not alt-country like &quot;Being There&quot; or &quot;A.M.&quot;  Instead, &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; is innovation, packaged and ready for you to buy and digest.  And buy it, you should.

B000068PQ0|1.0|wow, brilliant idea. this is what happens when you run out of ideas. there is not one interesting melody on this album. no effort was put into this. anyone can sit down with the right electronic equipment and make these sounds and overdub meaningless words without melody. these tunes are completely lifeless and the concept.. what concept? robots? there is no concept. this album is a farce. ...The only tune here with a melody is the 1st track, after that this album meanders into complete boredom.
0446608955|5.0|I first became interested in this book when i heard the movie was coming out. Im the kind of person who likes to read books before I see the movie. Therefor i started the book one afternoon and could not put it down. It told a story of a young Landon Carter who didnt care about grades or the future. Soon he stumbles across the unpopular Jamie Sullivan. Jamie teaches Landon alot about Friendship, Faith and even Love. Read this book but be ready with a box of tissues. When your done with the book... go ahead and rent the movie. Its a great story.

B00005OAIE|4.0|I have been a John Mayer fan for nearly 2 years now and I feel that Ricky Wright's analysis is way off base.  The reason John Mayer's album is enjoying immense popularity is because he celebrates his youthfulness instead of trying to appear more mature than he is.  He truly speaks to a generation that is often left out - the college-age set will associate with Mayer's themes of indecisiveness, regret, confusion, hope, and humor that surrounds those coming into the real world.  It seems to me that Wright has forgotten what it is to be young and not yet worldly wise.  Perhaps he should try to relate to Mayer's thoughts in &quot;No Such Thing.&quot;  I truly appreciate Mayer's work and the only problem I have with this CD is that 2 of his best songs, &quot;Quiet&quot; and &quot;Comfortable&quot; are not included.  I strongly suggest that those who enjoy Room For Squares try to obtain one of Mayer's live CDs.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I wouldn't be writing a review if I didn't say something negative, so I'll get it out of the way by saying John Mayer sounds like Dave Matthews Lite (if that's even possible) and, yeah, man does he talk about himself a lot. Now that that's out of the way, you should know this is a sweet and easy disc that is just begging you to check out of a harsh workaday world, kick back in a soft chair, and let Mayer's winsome little tunes remind you of being young, when the world for good or ill revolved around you.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is a really cool movie about a guy named Neo that's offered to go into &quot;The Matrix.&quot; He becomes on of their strongest fighters. He ends up having to save their leader Morphius with the help of one of his fellow Matrix people Trinity. I'm not going to give it away but if you like action/fighting movies you'll love this one!
0780020685|5.0|I've always heard about this movie but I was reluctant to watch it because I'm not fond of movies made in the 1950s.  But I decided to give it a try and I'm really glad I did.  Even though it's almost 50 years old, I still found the story to be top notch with great performances by the men who played the samurai.  The action was pretty good consider the year the movie was released.  The action scenes can't compare to today's action sequences but I'm sure that back in the 50's it must have been amazing to see.  It's nice to watch a movie that is the basis of so many action movies today.  At times I caught myself thinking that I've seen something from this movie in other movies, but then I remembered that most movies borrowed and took things from this amazing movie.  So I highly reccomend this movie, it's action scenes may seem dated to most of us used to today's action scenes, but the overall story, humor and character development makes this movie superior to 99.9% of todays action movies.
B000063K62|4.0|Trippy and incisive or visually irritating and pretentious? Half-empty or half-full? Richard Linklater's unique rotoscoped treatise on the Meaning Of Life seems to polarize its reviewers like night and day. If you like neat little tied-up Hollywood endings prefaced by  neon signs flashing plot points along the way, you are likely to find this one a snoozefest. If you go into this one with an open mind and an objective philosophical stance, you'll find it at least mildly engaging, and never boring. The fact that the film suffers from Attention Deficit Disorder is what makes it most interesting to this reviewer. Try this at home: Pop this film in the player while you're watching your favorite commercial TV program. During the spot breaks, instead of hitting 'mute' or surfing channels, watch &quot;Waking Life&quot; in 3 to 5 minute serialized segments. It all suddenly makes much more sense, doesn't it? It all boils down to perception (and I believe that's the point of the film).
0451191153|4.0|It is very difficult to review Any Rand: many people despise her work and ideas, and others are bouncing off the walls and joining the Ayn Rand institute. I have a lot of questions for her but I still bounce off the walls. This is not of book of \\"real\\" characters and it isn't supposed to be--this is a dramatization, almost cartoon-like, but still full of deep, totally new and differing people. Reading this was a roadtrip for my mind and I appreciate the unapologetic, straight-foward and well thought-out logic that says that altruism retards society. On this note, I oftentimes don't agree with Rand or can't see how her ideas can implemented well in \\"real\\" life, but she makes some excellent ponts and raises interesting questions that serve as scrumptious brain-food. She sides on the extreme and lets the responsible reader look elsewhere for a differing point of view.<br />I love it, just love it.
0671027344|5.0|This novel is a sensitive and touching portrayal of a troubled young mans search for a connection to the world through friends, music, and love. His story is revealed through a series of letters that he writes to an anonymous friend. He puzzles through the same problems that many other high schoolers face; drugs, suicide, sexual identity, and relationship problems. Ultimately he finds his own unique answers to those problems, and to other universal questions about life. The story is sweet and sad, humorous, and ultimately hopeful. A truly great first novel!

So I rented it....<BR>Thinking about the other movies nominated for Best Movie, Gosford Park must have last minute choice... there are way to many characters and you dont really care about any of the character because of this.

0790731002|3.0|I have to admit the series was ruined when Keaton and Burton left and so did their vision of gotham city. despite decent acting jobs from Val KIlmer, NIcole Kidman, and Tommy Lee Jones what really [messed] this movie up was Robin and the Riddler. Both actors seem out of place but so did the characters. I don't remember the riddler ever being so annoying or loud. i remember him being calm and extremely smart. Jim carrey's part showed neither of these qualities. This movie is much better if you watch it not as a sequel but as its own movie, that way you might not dislike it so much. On the other hand im just glad its not as bad as Batman and Robin.
0385503954|3.0|Enduring Love was my first McEwan read, followed by Amsterdam.  I held my breath for the release of Atonement, only to be sorely disappointed.  During the very slow start I found stock characters from 1930s literature and very little dialogue or background which tied the characters together.  I couldn't make it past the first 100 pages before deciding that it wasn't worth any more valuable reading time.<br />I must admit that I didn't do a close reading - I didn't look for the metaphors or analyze the dialogue for its significance to the development of the characters.  However, I didn't find it necessary to search for these clues when reading Enduring Love and Amsterdam, hence my disappointment.<br />I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this novel for pleasure reading.  However, I concede that it may be worthy of study.
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely love this movie, and I believe they did a fantastic job of staying true to Jane Austen's characters.  As with any book-to-screen rendering, some of the depth of the characters is lost, but thankfully only to a tiny degree in this picture.  Colin Firth was the PERFECT Darcy, I can't imagine anyone better for the role!  <br />I have watched this miniseries about once a month for the past year, and I can't imagine I'll ever get tired of it!  In fact, the story itself is so engaging that even my husband (who hates what he calls \\"tally-ho\\" movies) will sit and watch it with me almost every time!  If you buy it, you won't be disappointed!
B000002KD9|5.0|In the shadow of his crushing success with Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Neil Young released this solo album using some of his best studio friends to produce a landmark album that was a runaway best seller at about the same time as CSN&amp; Y's \\"D&eacute;j&agrave; Vu\\" was dominating the charts. There are a lot of memorable songs included in this album, all written by Young, and Neil's trademark guitar twang is audible everywhere. Also quite evident is his strange, eerie voice, which would be almost laughable were it not so memorable and also so effective a vehicle for his music.  It drifts out at you like an echo in an alley, invading your private spaces as much as entertaining you.<br />The album opens with \\"Tell Me Why\\", a plaintive ballad delivered in a mostly acoustical format. Next is \\"After The Goldrush\\", a dreamy, sometimes nightmarish reflection on the state of the country at the turn of the seventies. Also included are \\"\\"only Love Can Break Your Heart\\", a long and rocking version of his famous \\"Southern Man\\" effort, including the afterward of \\"Till The Morning Comes\\". He does a terrific cover of Don Gibson's classic country song \\"Oh, Lonesome Me\\", and depresses us all with \\"Don't Let It Bring You Down\\". I simply love his song \\"Birds\\", and also like the rock treatment of \\"When You Dance\\".  Finally, he delivers what has become a standard folk-rock ballad, \\"I Believe In You\\", which with \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\" rounds out the album. This is a classic Neil Young effort, and like his work with Crazy Horse, is essential for any serious sixties rock fan. Enjoy!
B000066I6N|5.0|In a good way, ouch.  Lovely lovely, and one of his best, right up there with 'Fate of Nations.'  Except there isn't a falter on this one, whilst FoN had that Promised Land song, which isn't stellar, but not too bad.  Anyway, I digress.  He sounds good, his band sounds incredible, and there are a couple songs on here so beautiful they hurt, namely Tim Buckley's 'Song to the Siren.'  HOLY SCHNIKES.  I just got it yesterday and about killed that song.  The strings are glorious.  His 'Hey Joe' is eery.  To top it all off, Plant sounds incredible and even on occasion a little seductive.  Highly, highly delightful album.
B00005UKKH|5.0|This is my favorite movie of Steve McQueen's.<BR>I has a good caast and the plot is great. Not only does it have the very firstand best chase scene. the final part where MQueen chases the bad guy at the airport amongst the planes is great.<BR>I recomend this movie greatly.
0679411585|5.0|This is a great book and I enjoyed reading about a real life battle from first hand. While reading this book you get to know about what really happen, the lives,and the men who fought so bravely. The book is better than the movie. General Moore and Mr. Galloway thanks.
6304493681|1.0|There have been great existentialist works in the past, and there have been mediocre ones. Here's one way in which they can be distinguished - in the great works, the existential themes of the works are _never_ delivered literally by one of the characters, speaking in monotone, in a dialogue that is so contrived that it sounds like a series of monologues, addressed directly to the reader or viewer. That is not profundity. That is incompetence. That, however, is exactly what happens in Ghost in the Shell.<br />I have not read the book this was based on, and after seeing the film, I will never have any desire to. Even if I charitably grant the possibility that it was good, the film still failed entirely at presenting its content. There is no reason to care for anyone in this film. It supposedly poses some profound existential questions, but it does so in such a self-important way that I could almost hear the sound of the director patting himself on the back, congratulating himself for his own coolness. Since the time that could have been used for character development goes to use for these affected monologues (complete with quoted scripture), at the end of this film I felt no closer to its protagonists than I was at the beginning. I also felt no desire to get any closer to them, since they never serve as aught else than wooden mouthpieces for the director's profound existential questions (which, when treated in this manner, are not anywhere near as profound, or as original, or as worth pondering, as he would like to think).<br />The result is drabness and tedium. The screenplay is dry, the characters and their drama are so stilted and forced that they may as well not exist, the action scenes are boring (since there is no reason to be emotionally involved), and the film doesn't even have the saving grace of looking good. I vaguely remember one or two scenes when it was raining that I might have perhaps considered visually appreciable, but I have more recollections of scenes that induced headaches. And the nudity is nothing but gratuitous - bafflingly so, since Motoko Kusanagi is so unlike a real human that she is not only unattractive but vaguely repulsive.<br />There is one good line in the film, and even this line is only good relative to the rest of the screenplay. It is this: &quot;You're treated like other humans, so stop with the angst!&quot; There you go. Now you have no need to see this film any longer. This could have been a thought-provoking, beautiful, profound film that might have given Japanese animation some much-needed credibility in the arena of world cinema. Unfortunately, the director of Ghost in the Shell was blissfully unaware of what makes a film any of these things. The result is thoroughly unlikeable.
B000067CPX|2.0|Very depressed!!  Thats how I feel after listening to this CD.  If this was the first time I ever heard the RHCPs then I would think that they were a pop sellout band.  However, I remember the last 7 albums full of original, rock, rap, and funk.  Nobody could play funk rock like the Chili Peppers.  Now, I understand that they are almost 40, so I forgive them for not totally rocking out.  Where are the funky riffs and rhymes?  This album is completely flat and very boring.  \\"Under the bridge\\" was a new direction for the Chili peppers, but they have tried to duplicate it on 12 of the 14 tracks on the Cd and failed miserably.  I can't tell you how disappointed I am. This music is supposed to pump you up not mellow you out.  At least, I have their last 7 albums.
078401213X|1.0|In order to be good, a psychological drama has to involve real people. If a psychological struggle has no basis in reality, it ceases to become a struggle and just becomes some fiction perpetrated on the world by a hack. There is supposedly a psychological struggle in Pi, but it is so far-fetched and fabricated that its basis in reality is tenuous at best. Max Cohen is a genius (how?) who studies number theory (why?) to make a Great Discovery of some kind. We're not too clear on the details of this, obviously, because Darren Aronofsky is a pretentious filmmaker and not a scientist, and thus cannot give us any details that range beyond \\"extremely shallow.\\" But that's okay, since the point isn't the plot - the point is all the meaningless fluff Aronofsky throws on to mask the incompetent lack of a plot. Thus, we get absolutely random shots of a pulsating brain (representing, like, his emotional stress or something, man), a smattering of Jewish mysticism (with no information that couldn't be discovered in a five-minute Internet search, mind you - wouldn't want our film to have substance, here), Oriental philosophy (a Go board! how deep!), a techno soundtrack (how edgy!), a ponderous script rife with weighty one-liners, overacting, and best of all, grainy black and white.<br />So Aronofsky is big on style. Maybe he'd be a half-decent cinematographer, although his \\"innovative camera angles\\" strike me as soulless and banal. But he is not a cinematographer; he is a director, and one who thinks he's an artist, no less. And I'm sure he'd say I just didn't understaaand his film. Oh, but I do understand - I understand that this film banks manipulatively on the fact that most people know just about as much about mathematics, mysticism or psychology as its creator, and thus would harp upon the \\"depth\\" of these things just because they were included. Pi is not the story of a man sliding into insanity, it is the story of what an arrogant, Harvard-graduated director thinks a man sliding into insanity is like, complete with a whole arbitrarily assembled collage of previously used \\"symbols\\" that he thought were cool when he first saw them, and a veneer of Philosophy Lite - all the clever words and cool concepts without the whole profundity thing. If you find such a thing in some way interesting, feel free to watch it. I, personally, do not.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I love war films, and this is one is outstanding...<BR>First time I saw it was on TNT channel more than 5 years ago and I was hooked to it.<BR>This is just not another historic film but also a point of view from the very participants of the battle. You get to see a Confederate general crying for a Union general who was like a brother for him, for instance...<BR>Be aware that the film lasts 4 hours, but it'll take you more than that time to watch it completely...
B000066JES|5.0|Finally, a Manowar record to rival the classics \\"Fighting the World,\\" and \\"Kings of Metal.\\"  This record is unbelievable.  The boys take their two greatest assets -- Thunderous Metal, and glorious Battle Hymns, and put out a record unmatched in ten years.  I highly recommend this to all True Metal fans, especially those who have become a bit disillusioned with Manowar's slightly wounded last few studio records.<br />BUY IT!!!!!!
B000068PQ0|4.0|I had never of The Flaming Lips before yesterday. A used CD store was playing \\"Yoshimi\\" and I found myself really enjoying the songs. So I asked the people at the register who it was and they handed me the CD, which I bought without hesitation.<br />I've played it over and over since then and I like the music even more than the first time. \\"Flight Test\\" is contagious. It grooves, yet retains a beatiful melody and poignant lyrics. The title track is also one of my favorites--another infectious (and hilarious) groove.<br />The album has it's soft side, as well. \\"In the Morning of the Magicians,\\" \\"Ego Tripping, \\"One More Robot,\\" and \\"All We Have Is Now\\" are quite hypnotic and smack a bit of Pink Floyd. The more upbeat songs reminded me the the later Beatles material, which is a pretty solid endorsement.<br />I don't think \\"Do You Realize??\\" is close to the best track, even though it's featured on the little sticker affixed to the CD cover. It's okay, but the others are better.<br />Overall, \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\" is a fresh, strong album--easy to listen to and even easier to recommend!
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-man is the best hero movie ever compared to batman and superman series this would be the king of hero movies, it is awesome and I cant wait to get the dvd
B00005QW5X|5.0|The DTS sound is stunning.  And what an interesting movie.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this CD just for the title track and was surprised to find that I liked ALL of the tracks.  Very relaxing and enjoyable to listen to.  Very happy to have purchased it!!!
B000005YZM|5.0|Chris White's parents owned our local grocery when I was a kid, and his Mum used to pop &quot;the boys'&quot; latest single in with our weekly order for me and my brothers, so I was familiar with their work from the beginning.  Beechwood Park, which gives its name to one of the songs here, is the grounds of a private school near our home.<br />The irony is that they made such an enormous musical stride forward just before breaking up.  This album (I have the German Repertoire label copy with many bonus tracks, not this latest remaster) is definitely one of the finest albums of the 60s for both its songwriting and musicianship.  Like another of my favourites, Forever Changes, it did not sell well at the time but is now recognised as a classic.  If you haven't heard it, just listen.
B00003CXRM|3.0|The ideas behind this movie were wonderful. I mean, who would have thought of making a modern version of Homer's work The Odyssey to fit a group of criminals in the early 1900s. Our hero must go through many of the parallels of a Mythological epic, namely a one eyed prophet, beautiful Sirens, and continual problems with the \\"gods.\\" The three convicts get separated and try to reunite; the hero's journey (George Clooney) is characterized by bad luck, mistiming, and encounters with both good and evil individuals. What makes this a unique film is the humor that adds in to the serious plot, such as the hero's believe that one of his friends has, in fact, been turned into a frog. <br />I thought it was a little over-the-top in the soundtrack department, however. We really didn't need song after song after song. One or two would have sufficed. It took away from the flow of the story, and made the movie tend to drag a little. <br />A 3 and a half stars is about the rating I would give this film. I think it is better than average movie, but still has its flaws. Still, it is a movie I would recommend overall because it concieves a very original idea and goes with it. It is a movie that is willing to take a chance on making a serious and revered work into a modern adventure.
B000066I6N|4.0|I just picked this up today and I really like the album!!  The mellow vibe and sultry sounds will take you away and there are moments that will remind you of times of old and make you smile. I think the band sounds really good and there are some great non traditional sounds (electronic ones included) and instruments on this record. Robert's voice is very good too, he sounds great in his current range and very comfortable singing the songs. <br />Highlights on the album for me are: Fixin' to Die, Song to the Siren, Darkness, Darkness, Hey Joe, Win my Train Fare Home. <br />I definitely would recommend this cd to everyone, it has some of Robert's best work on it!
B000001OAA|5.0|I have been listening to this album steadily for YEARS. And it NEVER gets old. Garbage should be praised for their innovative music style which has gone on to inspire hundreds (or maybe thousands) of bands in the trip-hop/downtempo genre. My band Beauty's Confusion has a lot to owe to Garbage. This music is catchy, unique, depressing, and perfectly-produced. I was lucky enough to see Garbage in 1998 on their Version 2.0 tour... and it was great. Met (and got pictures with, and autographs from) Shirley, Butch, and Duke. They are the nicest people in the world. Truly. I was stoked when I met them all after the show in Tampa at USF. One gripe I have about Garbage though-- what's with the new album? They had two perfect albums-- and when I mean perfect I mean PERFECT-- then Beautiful Garbage came out and I'm like \\"no, this is not right\\". I'm sure I speak for a lot of Garbage fans when I say \\"what the hell are you guys thinking?\\" But hey.... hopefully they'll come back to their roots.... their roots are a solid, inspiring foundation and no one should ever take those two albums for granted. I sound so stupid when I say that but man, this album and Version 2.0 saved my life COUNTLESS times.... when I was down, depressed, bummed out, [angry] about girls, you name it. Thanks for everything, Garbage. I hope the next album is like the first two. And to everyone out there-- forget about how much airplay they got on eMpTyV.... listen to this album as a whole and realize how well-written and amazing it is.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is an amazing anime!!! The animation is wonderfull and the dubbing is really good(which really is amazing!). Although if your a parent buying this for your child make sure your ok with them seeing PG-13 movies because this is definitly not a movie for a little 7-8 year old child who watches Sailor Moon/ Dragon Ball Z on cartoon network. The violence and gore would give your kid nightmares. On the other hand this is a really good action/drama movie spins a haunting tale that you dont want to end. The movie has everything! Action, drama, GREAT GHRAPHICS, and yes.. even a love story.(kind of like Spider-Man! Another really good movie!!) Anyway.. this is a must see movie. Anime fan or not...Just make sure you see it!!!
B000055ZB8|5.0|Murnau's silent classic is presented with original tints and intertitles, a choice of two musical soundtracks and one scholarly film commentary.  This is the longest running and most complete version -- almost twenty minutes longer than some other versions.  GET THIS - you won't be disappointed. Every vampire movie since NOSFERATU owes a debt to this groundbreaking film.
0441172717|5.0|This book is completely amazing. I can't say much more then that. Every bit of it made me want more. The best way I've heard it put is by Arthur C. Clarke who stated: &quot;I know of nothing comparable but 'The Lord of the Rings'&quot;. That's all that is close. Every book in the series is as good or better then a book in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.
B00003CXE6|3.0|Well, I don't THINK I saw the same movie everybody else did! \\"Gladiator\\" won all these Academy Awards and accolades, and my heavens, I really don't know why. I'll have to check what else was up for the Oscar for an insight into that decision.<br />Russell Crowe stars as the victorious Roman general even Marcus Aurelius wants to succeed him as ruler of Rome. But Marcus A. makes the really stupid mistake of telling his biological son his plans in private, so guess what happens to him? Suffice it to say that the son quickly becomes the new emperor. The general survives a death plot only to find himself enslaved and sold to a gladiator trainer played by Oliver Reed.  When we hear that the new emperor is terribly fond of Coloseum games, we can put two and two together to figure out the rest of the plot.<br />Bad Things?  The cutting was so confusing, I didn't know what was happening! Major problem. Another problem was the so-called acting of Russell Crowe. This is best actor? More like walk-thru acting to me. He was far better in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\".    <BR>Best Thing? Joaquin Phoenix as the villainous young emperor. He really stands out in the picture. Seems to me he's been studying his Laurence Olivier tapes, especially \\"Spartacus\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights\\".         <br />The most obvious predecessor to this movie is Kirk Douglas' \\"Spartacus\\". There, a gladiator army takes on the legions of Rome with some success before their tragic downfall. Even has a gladiator school, though Peter Ustinov's is a more interesting place.  Other familiar scenes of gladiators who won't follow \\"thumb\\" in the arena, allowing their vanquished foes to live also derive from \\"Spartacus\\". I further contend that the makers of this movie were ripping off--now don't laugh at me--the Kevin Sorbo \\"Hercules\\" TV movies. Look at the one where Hercules has to journey to the underworld and his wife gets killed. You'll find it strangely reminiscent of a lot of this movie, especially the music and Elysium depictions of his wife in the afterlife. But frankly, \\"Hercules\\" is more entertaining than \\"Gladiator\\", and of course so is \\"Spartacus\\".     <br />So, after all the hoopla I'm really taken aback to see how unimpressed I was by \\"Gladiator\\". \\"Gladiam\\" that I saw it for free at a church social, rather than having had to shell out my own dough.
0385503954|4.0|Ian McEwan writes beautiful sentences. I read a portion of Atonement out loud and it delighted my tongue. In many ways the book reminds me of Henry James, from his ironies and shifting points of view to his rich appreciation of class and transgression. The book continually surprises the reader, whether by taking a dark turn into the horrors of war or presenting literary criticism in the midst of a hospital scene. I enjoyed the way atonement continually beckoned but was never achieved, even in the creation of such a perfect book. From beginning to end I was delighted and intrigued, and yet I put the novel away with the sense that it was over and done. Even though some strands were left amusingly unraveled, they didn't tug at my conscience or feelings. I prefer books that embed themselves in the skin and leave you changed. Some of McEwan's earlier novels did just that, but this one was too self-contained. Many books need a reader to bring it to life, but this one seems just fine on its own. Maybe that accounts for some of its popularity.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Traffic is a great movie about drugs and how they ruin the lives of people who sell and use them. The movie is devided into three different stories. One of a teenages life using drugs and the steps she takes to quit. I own the movie and i give it 5 stars. i encorage you to watch this movie , because it will change your life.
B000062XFG|4.0|Aside fom the drastic changes that happened between seasons(casting and character promotions),The second season of TNG was a big improvement over the first.Yet it was still far from the great show it would later become.    The intrduction of Guinan(as well as Ten-Forward)and the temporary residence of Dr Kathrine Pulaski in The Child,added a new dimension to the show.The best episodes include The Measure Of A Man,The Emissary,A Matter Of honor,and of course Q Who,which not only brought back Q,but introduced The Borg.    The second season was a strong indication of the great things to come.
B000068PQ0|5.0|You will not be disappointed with this new CD from the Flaming Lips.  I really loved The Soft Bulletin and this CD will probably be better than that after a few more listens.  The entire album is actually quite an interesting story with the little girl Yoshimi battling the pink robots in the middle.  Great lyrics, catchy melodies.  Very strange but thoroughly enjoyable.
B000067CPX|5.0|i must admit when i first heard this cd i had to say, where did the chilipeppers go? there was no hard funk anywhere on this cd like everyone is used to. well i listened to it a few times and after a while some of the songs really started to jump out at me. then i realized that this cd was going in a whole different direction than any other previous cds. i have to hand it to rhcp, they made a cd for themselves and not for thier fans. you can tell they worked long and hard to make each song sound like nothing you've never heard before. some people will be able to follow them there, but most people won't. if you like the older stuff like mother's milk or blood sugar sex and magic you won't like this cd.
B000000WI6|5.0|The jazz station in Austin played the title cut in 1989 or so, and I bought the album, my first by the artist. I was amazed at how good the guitar work sounded. I wasn't and still am not sure how he is regarded compared to other guitarists, but some of my favorite guitar licks of all time are on this album, right up there with Stevie Ray, Jimi, Billy Gibbons and a few others.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|This was probably the most confusing (& boring) movie I've tried to watch in a long time.  The critics gave it such rave reviews that I should have known it would be a real snore!
B0000640VO|1.0|Take the most artsy-fartsy, self-consciously cute-as-a-bug 30-second television commercial past which you've ever fast-forwarded.  Multiply it by 180 or so.  Add subtitles.  Sound good to you?  Then \\"Amelie\\" is definitely up your quaint \\"Franche\\" alley.  Me, I'm sticking with the substance and grit of my deluxe widescreen DVD of the complete \\"Snuggles the Fabric Softener Bear\\" commercials. <br />...
B000068PQ0|4.0|I have only listen to the new Flaming Lips album twice all the way through and am currently on my 3rd go and it has gotten better each precious time I play it.  I have to start out and say that, no, this is not as magnificent as the Soft Bulletin.  I mean it didn't hit me the way that album did.  Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of strings and fancy studio tricks to go 'round, in fact, I think this is part of the downfall of &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots&quot;.  Can I say that I think this is sometimes to experimental? Can there be  to much composition to a Flaming Lips Record? Song?<BR>The album starts of with an incredible track not to far of...get ready for this...Cat Stevens Father and Son?  Does anyone else hear it in the melody? Beautifully arranged and not too flashy it certainly is a strong opener.  My favorite song on the disc is &quot;Are You A Hypnotist&quot; which has a Radio Head feel to it.  A galactic guitar based song with less of Coyne's  animated sing along lyrics and one of the shorter tracks on the album but none the less a jaw dropping arrangement full of sound.  <BR>Youshimi Battles The Pink Robots pt. 1 is very reminiscent of the Spider Bite song from Bulletin simply because of it's lyrical content...kinda silly...kinda sad. Some of the weaker songs include It's Summertime, Approaching Pavonis Mons By Balloon, and All We Have is Now.<BR>Some of the magic is gone and replaced by techno beats and studio wizardry, none the less,masterfully done by Dave Friedman, but one can't deny the genius that is the Flaming Lips.  Definitely worth repeated listens.
B00005RDRO|4.0|This is a hilarious movie that is prefect to watch after Clue.  Makes jokes about mystery novels as you try to find out who-done-it out of a group invited to dinner. A great find!
B0000640VO|5.0|I just can't say enough good things about this movie. It is funny, touching, romantic, adventurous, creative and beautiful. You just can't guess what Amelie will do the next in the movie, which make it very interesting and entertaining. It even lingers in your mind afterwards. I also heard about the Amelie effect... People act more kindly after watching the movie. Amelie is such a great movie that (to be honest) I felt like I am enlightened. The experience was priceless!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This was a great movie to see in the theaters but it's even better having the DVD at home!  The added features, games, etc., have got to be the best I've seen so far!  The quality and sound on this DVD is great and again the added features are wonderful!  I love all the characters and stars who provided voice-overs for the animation but I have to say that the Donkey/Eddie Murphy definately made the movie!<br />Great fun, great laughs and lot's of enjoyment!  I highly recommended this for your collection - the DVD is a must have!
B000002LCB|4.0|Knopfler is an outstanding composer, but the production team failed us slightly on this CD. One of the tracks has a high-pitched whine in the background that gives me a headache. Also, this is not the same soundtrack that you hear in the movie; it is the same music recorded differently. There are many major differences between the movie music and the soundtrack equivalent... but there's no other way to get the soundtrack, so we'll just have to live with it I guess.
6305428387|5.0|I've seen this movie several times on tv, and my daughter loved it so much that she wanted me to get it for her.  I have to say that I was thrilled to see that amazon.com had the item in stock and at such a great price! <br />This movie is very inspiring in the fact that the Jamaican bobsled team had to overcome so much to get to the Winter Olympics and overcome the ridicule from everyone.  John Candy and all the actors did a fantastic job in portraying these young and inspiring Jamaican's!<br />This film is great for the entire family and I would highly recommend it to anyone!
B00005MCX2|5.0|The speil I usually give to people who turn their nose up at me when I announce my rabid Hawkwind fandom (people, by the way, who've usually never even heard any of their music) is that Neil from \\"The Young Ones\\" TV show ruined Hawkwind for an entire generation. By lumping them in with lily-livered lightweights like Genesis and by tainting them with strong hippie associations, everyone assumes they're either horrendously indulgent prog-rock, or embarrassingly dated peace-&-love musings. Hawkwind never were either.<br />Hawkwind, at their peak, as on '73's live \\"Space Ritual\\" double LP, were an air-tight rock'n'roll demolition unit who combined the best of trancey psychedelia and buttocks-scorching rock'n'roll. If you have the remotist interest in Krautrock or the pre-Punk school of high-energy rock a la MC5/Stooges/Pink Fairies/Deviants, then you need this in your collection.<br />From Dik's crazy synth whoops and bleeps thru to the sublime sci-fi spoken-word babble right up to the apocalyptic \\"Orgone Accumulator\\" (almost 10 minutes of pure sonic fist-shaking bliss), this is an album for both rock'n'roll purists and avant-prog geeks alike (I fall somewhere between the two).<br />Whilst nothing can compare to the original vinyl version with its fancy fold-out cover, this CD version is almost as good as it contains bonus tracks and a very well put together booklet with new photos, graphics and liner notes. Unlike many other reissues, it's nice to know that someone at the label actually put some care into it.<br />If you must know, everyone from Jello Biafra to John Lydon has sung the praises of this set, so do the done thing and get on it.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I wasn't too interested in seeing this movie but my mother & 9 year old daughter were so I tagged along.  I'm glad I did as I thoroughly enjoyed myself!  Another great movie for the entire family, not just for kids - not just for adults but for everyone!  The special effects are wonderful!  Tobey Maguire is on his way to making his name a household word!  If there is a sequel (and we all know there will be) the studio would be fools not to sign Tobey Maguire up again as he is your \\"friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!\\"
B000066I6N|5.0|This is the best selection of (mostly) covers I've heard since Mark Lanegan's &quot;I'll Take Care of You.&quot; Every one of them deserves the extended life that Plant is providing.  The overall tone is melancholy, Plant's in fine voice, and the CD will be a keeper for anyone who enjoys a good, sad, wallow once in a while.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Lara Croft is quite the fanny kicker in this movie! This movie is adventuous, the actors were great, and the special effects were fantastic! I have to say that I loved how Lara Croft could kick this one guys fanny! My 9 year old daughter loves this movie and I bought it for her. We've had it for about 6 months and she's probably watch it about 3 dozen times if not more!<br />If you want a really good movie with adventure, action and a great team of actors then this DVD is for you.  I can't wait for the next Tomb Raider movie to come out, which is currently being filmed!!  Should be quite exciting and adventurous!!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|Having been a fan of the Flaming Lips for close to 14 years, it has been amazing to see the band develop into one of the truly great American bands of all time.  Ever since they dropped their first beginning-to-end classic \\"In a Priest Driven Ambulance\\", the band has continued to push its vision of what music should be: well-formed songs brimming with a unmistakably unique Flaming Lips musicality.<br />\\"Yoshimi\\" is an excellent follow-up recording to the band's best album, \\"The Soft Bulletin\\".  My expectations for this new release were high, and I am not at all disappointed in the results.  \\"Fight Test\\" opens the album with a huge bang--Stephen Drozd's drums full and booming.  One thing you'll immediately notice, as you do with all the Warner Bros.-era Flaming Lips records, is the quality of the production values.  \\"Yoshimi\\" sounds HUGE; it is thick with beautiful noise that is no doubt due to long-time collaborator Dave Fridmann.<br />Lyrically, \\"Yoshimi\\" seems to parallel \\"The Soft Bulletin\\" in its thematic content.  The contemplation of life and death along with the fight to lift above all the difficulties we all face are the common thread here.  I never felt that the lyrics on \\"Bulletin\\" were sad or negative, quite the contrary.  Life and all its foilables are touched on here as they were on the last album to stunning effect.  You will definitely find yourself singing along with Wayne Coyne's sweet warble at the onset of hearing this.<br />The highlights: \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 1\\", \\"Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell\\" and \\"Do You Realize??\\" are all superb songs.  I must admit at first that I had some trouble with \\"Yoshimi...pt. 2\\" and the final song, but after repeated listens, these songs fit snuggly within the context of this disc.<br />If you are familiar with previous Flaming Lips albums, you will not be disappointed in \\"Yoshimi\\".  It is the perfect companion piece to the epic \\"Bulletin\\".  This may not be the best place to start for neophyte Lips listeners--go to \\"The Soft Bulletin\\" first then \\"Yoshimi\\".  After doing so, you will find going backwards through the Lip's back catalog as exciting and rewarding as I have going from the (near) beginning to their present-day excellence.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I hadn't really heard of Shakira before her hit song 'whenever, wherever' but after hearing that and loving it every time i heard it on the radio i decided to see what else was on the CD- so i bought it and instantly loved Objection Tango, eyes like yours, suerte, and te aviso, te anuncio. I especially liked Eyes like yours because it combination of middle-eastern and spanish ryhmthm and beat. I still listen to this CD over and over-
B00006F2TV|5.0|I don't really like fullscreen DVD's, but I wanted to be the first one to review this DVD. Spider-Man is pretty much one of the best superhero films next to Batman. I'm so glad that Danny Elfman composed the music. He is my favorite music composer. Sam Raimi did good direction for this film, and Tobey Maguire did good as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. I am very excited to get this DVD when it comes out on Nov. 1. I will definitely be getting it the first day it comes out.
B00003CXP0|1.0|This movie tried too hard, tried to be cool, tried to be artistic, tried to be dirty and it missed its mark everytime.<BR>I dont even know if the actors did a good job because the camera would never hold still long enough. If u want to see a real movie about drugs or the streets buy Trainspotting or Kids
B000066NW0|5.0|I absolutely love this cd. She seems to be along the lines of Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton, with a little more punk edge. Its great to finally have a cool artist with catchy lyrics and such that doesn't portray herself as a totally fake sex symbol, like many of today's artists. For those not sure about buying the cd, I highly recommend it. Every song on this cd is great, so I'm not preoccupied changing and skipping every other song. She has loads of talent and I hope to see more from this great artist!
B00004TDRD|5.0|Dun dun dun!  ^^ Hehehe Well, who couldn't give this a 5/5 rating?  This is the first classic animal film to be remembered for generations to come!  So...the effects weren't extravagent but this is what most films are ripped off of today...If you haven't seen this film yet (which is kind of hard to believe) I highly recommend it!  Lots of blood and guts!  Maybe a bit much for real little kids...
B000066NW0|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!!! She is a WONDERFUL song writer and I think her spelling of \\"boy\\" as \\"boi\\" is unique (I have some what adopted it into my own writing) She's just a girl about my age and she's done more and gotten further then most of this sorry planet will ever ;o) She's not trying to be anything that she's not (that includes a sell out) and all her stuff is totally original! I am a music fanatic and I haven't heard any thing this...(for lack of a better word) incredible in a long time. I really hope she goes far and shows the world that she is and will continue being whatever she wants herself to be. (And I wish people wouldn't criticize when they really have no idea what they are talking about) (btw, I LOVE her style in everything from her music to her clothes)
B00004T37H|5.0|The greatest anime film (in my opinion) of all time!  Mononoke Hime!!! ^^ About the princess Mononoke, raised by wolves in a rural 14th century Japan.  I look forward to Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited away and Laputa: Castle in the Sky as well!  If you love anime, please see this one, it will keep you on the edge of your seat to the cutting end with blooded war scenes, gigantic animal gods and the one who may be able to bring peace to it all!
B00004X01U|5.0|While Michael Jackson desperately chases after &quot;five-minutes-ago&quot; producers for his albums, Madonna has lately been digging deep and collaborating with hip people who may otherwise slip past mainstream's radar screen.  On &quot;Music,&quot; her second album of electronica, the artist currently known as Mrs. Ritchie reunites with William Orbit and also ropes in French DJ Mirwais.  The Orbit collaborations work very well: &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; is set to a frenzied, energetic beat, while &quot;Amazing&quot; finds an arsenal of psychedelic guitars slammed against drum loops and synth bleeps.  Musically speaking, &quot;Amazing&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Beautiful Stranger.&quot;  But the cuts with Mirwais go the deepest.  The title track is a fond throwback to 80's r&amp;b tossed with some synth pop; &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is a trippy acid-like number, and the single &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; works with its acoustic guitar and a hiccuping drum beat and bassline.  My two favorite cuts of choice are the brutally honest &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; (a sincere Mea Culpa) and the country twang of &quot;Gone.&quot;  At a mere 10 tracks, &quot;Music&quot; is a brisk ride, but it's a pleasant one that fails to disappoint.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|What can I say about Memento??? Well, it's AMAZING!!! This movie is so fresh and sylish. Do yourself a favor GO BUY THIS DVD. You won't regret it. Guy Pearce's performanc is wonderful. Joe Pantoliano is also. And the way the movie pieces itself together is so cool.
B000031WD9|4.0|\\"American Pie\\" is no raunchier than the average run-of-the-mill teen flick, but what makes this a step above the rest is that this movie has a heart.  A group of high school seniors make a deal to lose their virginity before graduation, and they all run into all sorts of drama.  The cast is a charm.  Jason Biggs shines as the loveable dork Jim, who keeps getting into one humiliating episode after another.  His scene with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) could go down as one of the most hilarious moments in film ever.  Seann William Scott is great as the playfully obnoxious Stifler; he's rude and charmless and yet you can't help but still like the dude.  Mena Suvari also stands out, as does Tara Reid (which is really saying something).  If \\"There's Something About Mary\\" was the must-see comedy of 1998, then \\"American Pie\\" was the must-see comedy of 1999.  It's not too late to pick up this DVD; for one, you'll finally get the chance to know what your friends mean when they recite the one-liner: \\"this one time, at band camp...\\"
B00005JLDW|4.0|I'm sure the title of my letter has created a groaning noise all across the net, since there are so many movies that should have been shortened by three hours at least. However, this movie could have been enormous if ample time had been available to really explore its story.<br />After reading other reviews, most seemed satisfied with the visual effects,were less than thrilled about the heavy accents,were even less thrilled wth the plot, but still couldn't go all the way to disliking the movie. I had the exact same response to Minority Report, which I forgot within 10 minutes of my theater exit. Throughout my Reign of Fire experience, I was amazed at how strongly I could feel the plight of the characters, particularly those in the background like the small children who were powerless against the threat that they faced. When attacked by the male dragon, with fire engulfing the last bastion of hope they had, there was an absolutely apocalyptic weight in the air, and I appreciated the efforts of everyone involved in creating that, because it's rare now to ever feel more involved in a movie plot than you would in the average Lottery commercial on T.V. You know; the one where there's only one winner, it's obviously not you, and no matter how hard you try, you just can't jump for joy about it.<br />The explanation of events in the movie was believable, and they did a relatively good job of getting themselves out of the bind the trailer got them in; namely explaining how 40 people were going to defeat millions of dragons while resorting to such tactics as jumping off of rooftops with battle axes. However, I would like to have seen a lot more of the backstory portrayed on film, and a much more involved, developing resistance to the dragons resulting in far more unsuccessful rebellion attempts of increasing complexity and danger. The film felt really short, like there was so much ground to cover and such a mountain of a premise to overcome, and thus, defeating a million dragons was factored down to defeating just one real...dragon. I'd have taken the risk and played out a plotline based on the trailer's premise; it would have made the movie all it could have been.<br />I agree with the consensus that there should have been far more interaction with the dragons themselves at a much closer range than what we saw. They ultimately appeared to be little more than a plot device scripted in to add urgency to the relationship between the lead characters. This was a major flaw, similar to but not as devastating as seen in that $98 million Heckle and Jeckle movie with the cameo by Godzilla. I was also not amused by the party scene with the Jimi Hendrix music playing in the background. Yes the roof is on fire, but hopefully because of the dragons, not because the music was funky. The intensity of the situations depicted simply demanded more in-depth experiences than we were given.<br />All in all, Reign of Fire was enjoyable for what it was, even with knowledge of what it COULD have been. Sure, it borrowed from Jurassic Park, possibly Waterworld, and practically worshipped both The Terminator and Mad Max, but the premise, character acting, effects, and atmosphere more than made up for this. You may still groan at the title of my letter after what I've said, but for those who have seen it already, just think of what could have been done with this given the same running time as Lord of the Rings. For those who have yet to see it, see it now. Don't wait for the DVD, so you can be robbed of said atmosphere and the catastrophic power of many of its scenes...
B0000640VO|1.0|I had expected this movie to be great, given all that I'd heard about it, but it goes nowhere.  Not every movie has to have a plot, but every movie should have a _point_.  (Am I supposed to be happy that she winds up with the porn-shop guy?  How sweet.)  What really ruins it for me, though, are the pointless references to Princess Diana's death that seem to be there only to make fun of people who were upset by it and Diana, for not being \\"worthy\\" of their grief.  <br />One star because I can't give it zero.
B000066I6N|5.0|This is the most relaxed I've heard Robert sing for a while.  His voice sounds in tip top shape, and he sounds like he really enjoyed these songs.  I really enjoyed these songs too, Percy picked a good set list, and his band is good.  his guitarists did a really good job (the only way that could have improved was the addition of Mr. Page).  This album is not a &quot;lost Zeppelin album.&quot;  I've heard this compared to Led Zeppelin III, but I don't see it.  If you have an open mind about it, and don't expect another Zeppelin album, I think You'll like it.  I'm looking forward to an album of new Plant material, or better yet, teaming up with Jimmy and JPJ.
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah was always the most wholesome thing on the block back in the early 90s. Belting out heartfelt ballads with unnerving accuracy for the pole position on the charts, she was a pop girl you could bring home to the family. Then came her divorce, and soon she was breaking away from that, with a steamy Bond girl-esque video for this album's first single, the bouncing &quot;Honey&quot;. Catchy, and uptempo, and slick with a R&amp;B groove, it signaled a time of change for the diva. &quot;Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; soon followed that number one as video/radio singles, both classy tunes, and polar opposites. The title track, is a ballad, while the other tune is a hip-hop slow jam. Both are great in my opinion, and were followed by THE ballad of the album, &quot;My All&quot;. Sure, this album has ballads in droves, they're a Mariah neccesity, but this one takes the cake, a powerhouse tune, it made number one too, and was mixed into dance hit also. Other excellent tunes are here, besides these singles though, the slow grooving &quot;Babydoll&quot;, the hip-hopping &quot;The Roof&quot;, and the Butterfly reprise &quot;Fly Away&quot;, being stand outs in my opinion. Definitely one of her better albums, and the best effort of her past five or six years of releases. Essential Mariah.
B0000636UN|5.0|For years I was on the fence about buying an album from Sheryl Crow, and regretfully I never got off that fence.  Never until now, that is.  After hearing the big hit &quot;Soak Up the Sun,&quot; I went out and bought C'mon, C'mon as soon as it was released.  The album has been a very regular spin in my CD player ever since - I continue to listen to this album in its entirety and don't get sick of it.  For 2002, this is roots rock and roll at its best.  This album is packed with compelling chords, infectious melodies, and great vocal arrangements.  I have to give Sheryl Crow credit: she's really an excellent musician, one who can write her own music, play her own instrument, and deliver marvelous vocals.  <br />The songs on this album range from exhilarating, up tempo, rhythmic rockers (such as the first two tracks) to beautifully soft, introspective ballads (like Abilene or It's Only Love), and everything in between.  &quot;Safe and Sound&quot; is a moving slower tune that marvelously highlights the strength of Crow's voice.  Don Henley offers a cameo appearance on &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; which is a great addition to the album.  &quot;Diamond Road&quot; is one of my very favorites, a well-written song fortified by a wonderful melody.  The title track and &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot; are irresistibly infectious, and who can withstand the bump and grind of &quot;Lucky Kid&quot;?  The list goes on and on; every song on this album is a worthy listen.  <br />C'mon C'mon by Sheryl Crow is a great album, and I especially recommend it to the fans of good old roots rock and roll.  This is the first but definitely won't be the last album I get from this talented musician.

B00005JKNF|4.0|Gosford Park feels like one of those all-star Agatha Christie mysteries of the seventies and eighties, and one half expects Peter Ustinov to make an appearance at any moment. This is far sharper and more involving, however, than any other films of that genre. As usual, Altman's concentration is on the intriguing characters, and the suspenseful and charged atmosphere stems from observing the interplay between them. The mystery is palpably present from the very beginning; we sense something malevolent looming in the atmosphere, but are watching every move in order to see just how it will be manifest. Every word spoken and action made is laden with potential significance; therein Altman provides the audience with a fascinating and gripping look into a world of believable characters where any moment conflict might erupt into something deadly.<br />Altman spends most of the film building up to the main crime. Thereafter, everything is brought together convincingly and dramatically. Stephen Fry provides by far the film's most hilarious moments in his turn as a grossly incompetent police inspector.<br />Part of the film's fascination lies in its period setting, which has a feel of authenticity, and also in the clashing of two worlds, that of servants and masters. The veneer of distance between the two worlds, contrasted with the reality of the complex interrelations between them, lends the film a certain ironic undertone.<br />This is a film that requires repeated viewings, since there are subtle nuances that may not be noticed the first time around, not to mention such a wealth of characters and situations that one might well miss some of the plot details.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|The DVD features are fairly standard for this type of film. Filmographies, behind the scenes featurettes, design scetches, etc. However this packs in 2 commentaries. Unfortunatly I only had time (Hmm, sort of pun there) to watch one. Director Wells and the editor for the film do a nice job of giving the viewer a better sense of the scale of the production,(more actual sets and props were used than you may think)and lets the viewer in on all the homages and inside information that, at least for me,  are always fun to know.<BR>My only complaint is that the actual menus are little tiresome. Every menu choice leads you into a spinning whirlygig sort of thing. <BR>All and all however a DVD worth viewing. Certainly a film worth watching.
B000066NW0|2.0|I listen to THIS all the time.  But I can't figure out why.  Shes not punkish at all, just &quot;herself&quot; could be manufactured though.  Her music though interesting is pop anyone that puts  this in the same catagory as the Ramones (punk) is sick.  I don't even really listen to the songs, though Nobodys Fool is funny because shes doing this &quot;rap&quot; thing and fails badly.  I am (suprisingly) a fan, but still can't figure out why.<br />Can't fully endorse this because its not great.  Make sure you know you REALLY REALLY want this thing before you buy it.<br />Why  stars, its ok (3 stars but loses one because I can't figure out why I like her or this CD.
B0000640VO|4.0|The movie itself was like a breath of fresh air into a stuffy, smoke filled room. The DVD was a little hard to navigate. The larger the screen you are watching the easier it will be. The menu selections on this 2 DVD set are small and cramped. Plenty of special features, though I wish they had bothered to subtitle them. Many scenes such as the outtakes are only in french. Sure I knew what was going on and what was supposed to happen, but I think they would of been more fun had I known what everyone was saying or what they all found so funny.<BR>I would recommend renting before you buy it. This film was not for everyone and this DVD does not warrant owning if you didnt like the film.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is the best CD I've ever listened to in my life. Avril is *almost* your average 17-year-old punk. The only difference? Her amazing talent. Her voice is fierce, her guitar expertise is slammin, and her words are easy to relate to. She's a mix of Michelle Branch and Alanis Morissette. Here is how I rate each of her songs (out of 5 stars):<br />Losing Grip: *****<BR>This is one of my favorite songs on the CD. I *love* the music!<br />Complicated: ****<BR>Her hit single. I think it's pretty good, but not one of her best.<br />Sk8er Boi: ***<BR>The words tell a cute story.<br />I'm With You: *****<BR>This is also one of my favorite songs. I like the words.<br />Mobile: ***<BR>I like the chorus.<br />Unwanted: *****<BR>Another of my many favorites! This song is very emotional.<br />Tomorrow: ****<BR>This song is slow, sweet, and quiet.<br />Anything But Ordinary: ****<BR>I like this song, especially the chorus.<br />Things I'll Never Say: *****<BR>Another favorite. The words could've been written about the way *I* feel, they're so much like my life right now. This is the best song on the CD, in my opinion.<br />My World: ***<BR>Some of the words in this song are funny. (A *good* kind of funny, mind you.) And the part about her hometown sounds a lot like my own.<br />Nobody's Fool: ****<BR>I like the guitar. And it's cool that she can do both rap *and* rock. I like the \\"la-la\\"s.<br />Too Much To Ask: ***<BR>This song is sad. I can feel her pain.<br />Naked: ****<BR>This is a nice song. It's a good one to leave you with.<br />I hope this review helped! :)
B0000009S3|5.0|this has got to be the finest cd that has ever been created. now, a blow by blow.<br />peaches en regalia - what can i say except it's tight, fast, and unforgettable.<BR>willie the pimp - WHOOPOOPOPP, WHOOP WHOOP. if you can make yourself sound like captain beefheart on this song, beautiful girls fall out of the sky and want to \\"set you straight.\\"<BR>son of mr. green genes - this is quite possibly the most beautiful song that has ever been created. and i'm not kowtowing when i say that - i sincerely get goosebumps when i hear the finale. words won't do it justice<BR>little umbrellas - not my favorite, but a cool little ditty. is always played in dark smoky rooms.<BR>the gumbo variations - car trip? no worry! gumbo variations will keep you entertained.<BR>it must be a camel - this song is just too weird and too cool to pass up.<br />and there you have it. frank zappa is the man.
0780020685|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said?  The Criterion version has a great commentary, so check it out.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|I am very sorry but there is/was no rational explanation to what actually happened to Donnie, either he was dead already at the golfcourse or he managed to move time back (a little trickier). Personally I picked it up as him being dead when he first spoke to his rabbit 'friend'. And I would like to know whether mommie was in bed or on a plane at the time of the incident. Every time the engine fell off she was in bed except at 1 time when she was on a plane and at home in bed at the same time.
B000068QY7|5.0|I doesn't take an fan long to realize that this disc is something we haven't heard out of Oasis before. The songs are still out of this world, the lyrics...still painfully honest, the great guitarists...as strong as ever. However, on a handful of tracks, the voice has changed. You of course still have Liam with has unique, grinding voice on some tracks, but on others such as 'Force of Nature', 'Little By Little', and 'She Is Love', either Liam's range is beyond imagining or the finally let the multitalented Noel sing. These two very different voices add a new element to Oasis. Now more than ever, there songs remind you of the (good) Beatles tunes. 'Stop Crying Your Heart Out', 'Little By Little', and 'She Is Love' are some of the greatest songs ever released. It would not be a surprise to me if this disc was a repeat of 'Morning Glory' famewise. Oasis will now surely go down in history, that is, if there was ever any doubt.
0486411818|1.0|I've studied finite elements in various formulations, and my <BR>opinion would be that this is not an appropriate text for someone <BR>working in the real world of civil engineering, say, or heat<BR>distribution problems.  I think it is too abstract for general  readers.  It reminds me of one of my profs who advised us to stay away from mathematicians because the mathematician will teach you rigor and rigor mortis.  Still, it is a good book to have in your library just in case you need it, and it is available at a very reasonable price.
B000002KYR|3.0|I have to differ from these other reviewers. This is a good Top disc, but does not touch Tres Hombres, unless you like playing to a sequencer. Hardcore Top fans will agree that the true ZZ Top sound (Texas Sound) of rock and blues comes from the Tres Hombres and Fandango era. Come on. Even Rhythmeen tops this one, but then again MTV viewers probably like this better because it's so commercial. Give me &quot;Sure got cold after the rain fell&quot; any day to &quot;Gimme all your lovin&quot; or &quot;Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers&quot; to &quot;Legs&quot;. No comparison, but good to have in your collection. And Hello, Frank Beard is the Drummer Guys. Saw them many times , but when they played Curtis Hixon Hall(no longer) in Tampa, I became their biggest fan. Wish they would get back to their roots and not be the sell out they were in the 80's.
B000002BVN|5.0|I would say the first 6 tracks are amazing.  Yes, includes track #6, the SCREAM remix, I think it's even better then the original.  More trumpets involved.<br />Anyways, the title track #1 Blood on the Dance Floor is one of my fav MJ dance tracks.  You have to get into it to really like it.  Blast the song, loud! and sing along, it can be alot of fun.<br />#2 Morphine.  Totally produced by MJ alone.  Every instrument, lyric, everything.  Somewhere in the middle of the song, it transfers to this amazing melodic piece that is incredible.  One of MJ's best songs, especially the middle part.<br />#3 Superfly Sista is also a really fun track.  I think instrumentally and vocally, it's alot of fun.  Loads of &quot;hee-hee&quot;s and &quot;whooo&quot;s<br />#4 GHOSTS from the GHOSTS shortfilm.  This is such a good song, better if you see it on the shortfilm (about 35 minutes long!)<br />#5 Is it Scary, dang I got goosebumps when he sang this song on GHOSTS, plus 2Bad from HIStory.  This song is bashing the media, and it is one of MJ's best dance tracks to date.<br />Peace!  Rock on MJ, hope you win the war against SONY.
B00003CX5P|4.0|...could it have been?  No one will no that answer.  Nothing in my opinion could have lived up to the hipe surrounding Episode I, but all negative reviews aside I would have to say I still had fun watching Episode I.  And that is what is important.
B00003CX8V|5.0|This movie, directed by the legendary Billy Wilder, is one of my all-time favorites. It features a funny script, great acting, and an interesting and original plot. The Apartment is a perfect example of what is missing in Hollywood today: it is a witty, entertaining movie that relies on the script and on the acting to keep the viewer's attention and consequently does not need to use obscene language or inappropriate scenes to be amusing!<br />Essentially, The Apartment is about a young insurance company worker (played by Jack Lemmon in an excellent performance) who is forced to allow his philandering bosses to use his apartment on dates. In exchange for allowing his bosses to use the apartment, Lemmon is recommended to recieve promotions. Things get more complicated, however, when the bigger boss, Sheldrake (played by Fred McMurray) gets involved in the apartment renting. This would seem like a good thing for Lemmon - but there is one problem: McMurray (who is married and has no plans of divorcing) is dating Lemmon's dream girl, the beautiful elevator operator at the company (played by Shirley MacLaine). To say any more would be to give too much away...<br />In addition to having an intertaining plot and a funny, sarcastic script (like most Billy Wilder movies), The Apartment features amazing performances by all of its actors, especially Lemmon and MacLaine.<br />So I don't know how else to recommend this movie - get it soon and enjoy!
B00005O3VC|5.0|Holy Grail hasn't looked so good in many years. With \\"restored footage\\" of about 10 seconds in Castle Anthrax, nothing is really added much or lost. The Commentary tracks are interesting as the cast recorded it in two groups. For that, it makes the Special Edition excellent.<br />As far as other special features go... well.... um... you sort of need to see them for yourself, but if you are a fan of Python, you will appreciate them. There's a nice documentary of them visiting sites, and some other people's interpretaions of some scenes, as well as a singalong. I did enjoy the Lego version of \\"Knights of the Round Table\\".
B00003CXTF|1.0|This bit of Hollywood schlock is an insult to history as well as all WWII veterans and their families. The film was made to reach one audience; love-sick pre-fifteen year olds raised on video games, period.  If you have any interest at all in learning about the attack on Pearl Harbor, see Tora, Tora, Tora and forget this one.
B000059XUI|5.0|SO it doesn't have all the extras that Superman the Movie does, it still has Chris and Margot, and all the gang.  And it is in Widescreen, which in my opinion makes or breaks a movie these days.  He can flash that winning smile and we love him all over again.  No one play the hero like Christopher Reeve's
B00003CXI1|1.0|--<BR>It is not bad at all, but simply NOT deserve the attention. I have to admit the marketing is incredible effective!  Waaaaaaaay over rated!<br />It really deserves 2 or 3 stars, but I'd like to compensate ....<BR>--
B00003CXC6|5.0|The Criterion DVD is well worth the price.  THe commentary alone is worth it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is an insanely genius movie, I own this movie on dvd, and it has a lot of special features that give a little insight into the world of Lenerd Shelby, but then confuses you all over again. This movie twists the laws of film making, and boggles minds all at once. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, get your car keys and drive to Blockbuster right now, and rent this movie immediately. Watch this movie a couple times, let it sink in and intoxicate your mind, it will make you question your own memory, as well as the world around you. Take a closer look into the best movie in years, Mememto is a true film worth all the hype.
B00005LC1H|4.0|Fawlty Towers has to be one of the greatest, if not THE greatest (with Police Squad! being another great competitor), comedy shows of all time. Rining in at 12 episodes, each episode is able to remain tight in timing. Absolutely Brilliant.<br />The DVD set has excellent extras including interviews with cast members (you will never look at Manuel quite the same way after this).<br />The disappointment is it's stretched over 3 disks, with 4 episodes per disk. This probably should of fit on 2 DVD's, even with the extras. The Commentary is also mediocre at best, and probably could of been skipped. Better yet, they could of put the extras on their own disk if there wasn't room.
B00005OM5L|5.0|This concert is one of the first complete performances of Eric released in DVD. With amazing and crisp sound and picture, it represents a true document on contemporary music for future generations. Eric performs his classic tunes like Badge and Acoustic Layla plus great blues songs like Five Long Years and Tore Down. Here we see a Slowhand in top notch shape, soloing greatly, and singing with a lotta feeling, like a true blues man. This concert was taped in Hyde Park in 1996, in the midst of a heavy rain, which did not manage to scare away the thousands of souls touched by Eric's music. There are virtually no behind the scenes or interviews footage, which would've been great, but one addition to the DVD is the the classic blues It Hurts me Too, with great slide guitar by the amster. Don't let it pass, I can honestly say this is the best E.C. DVD out yet.
B00005QG9J|5.0|i bought \\"morning view\\" the day it came out, i popped it in and listened to it start to finish. and i loved it.  the first song \\"nice to know you\\" is an instant standout track, with its heavy riffs, and catchy chorus, its hard not to love. the second song \\"circles\\" is the second single, its pretty good, and pretty heavy too, one of the heavy tracks here.  number three \\"nice to know you\\" is the big hit, and it deserves to be, its very good, with a great message, and awesome lyrics.  number 5, \\"11am\\" is one of the best songs offered, it has an excellent riff, an awesome chorus, and just incredible lyrics throughout.  number 6, \\"blood on the ground\\" is the best track, and the heaviest track, with a killer chorus, fast guitars, and some loud loud singing by brandon, also with some of the most heartfelt lyrics on the album, it has reasons why its the best.  other standout tracks are \\"mexico\\" a sweet ballad, \\"warning\\" the third single, \\"have you ever\\", \\"are you in?\\" and \\"under my umbrella\\".<BR>***** out of *****.
B00005JL3A|1.0|As a gore-fest it works.  But, it is NOT scary, eerie, dramatic, convincing, in-depth, original, or based on the game.  It is only partially based on the award-winning highly successful video game.  If it followed the game closer, it might have been a masterpiece.
B00005RY7X|5.0|I must admit, I have found few bands to love from hearing their music in beer commercials.  Ok, ok, I've found NO bands that I even listen to from hearing them in beer commercials, and yet, it was a certain Colorado-based brewery's TV spot that introduced me to the supercharged sounds of Andrew WK.  I got the record soon after, and have been wowed by it's devil-may-care attitude and anthemic pop-metal sound.<br />\\"I Get Wet\\" *IS* an anthemic record, and the message is clear: PARTY.  The lyrics are not going to win any Pulitzer prizes, but so what?  They're still very fun to sing along with.  The leadoff track, \\"It's Time to Party\\" is a fast, furious, frenetic joyride that sets the tone for the rest of the album.  \\"Party Hard,\\" \\"Get Ready to Die,\\" \\"She is Beautiful\\" and \\"Party Till You Puke\\" are all lyrically silly and fun, driven by a musical juggernaut.  W.K.'s band has the biggest sound you will ever hear, but it's not just guitars, bass and drums.  There are many layers to the sound, and you can tell that all the songs have been lovingly tweaked in studio to squeeze every last drop of head-banging, bottle-breaking, chest-pounding explosiveness through your speakers.  The piano and keyboards played by W.K. add a quirky accent that sets this apart from other metal acts.<br />It is impossible to listen to this record and not have a good time unless you are old or dead.  The notion that this album is only for frat boys is also misguided; I've seen it embraced by everyone who likes good music and appreciates honest effort.  Andrew W.K. is nothing if not honest with his manic energy and love of music.
B000063K2W|5.0|It is a must-have on DVD and is quite the lavish spectacle. One of the best examples of the ultra-sophisticated black-and-white all-star comedy that no one could do better than George Cukor. Interesting also is the fact that despite the somewhat dated story of women of a specific social (and financial) station, much of the spirit and acerbic wit hold up very well today. Witness the debate between Norma Shearer and mom Lucile Watson about the importance of the husband (whether he cheats or not) in a woman's existence (the dialogue \\"what if I don't want him under those conditions\\" is especially timeless). The sets, wardrobe, dialogue, and especially the cast are all first rate. While the film has been digitally preserved for eternity, there is one small flaw in one section of the digital restoration where the black-and-white film gives way to the isolated Technicolor sequence. But it's at a great price. Grab immediately.
B00005B4GU|3.0|The people who like some of this music should start listening to Air, Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada.<br />Many people just like this cd because of the ambient sounds Radiohead uses as an extent to their rock music.<BR>And that's an easy way to attract all of these people who never have listened to the bands like I mentioned above.<br />Because all of these people who listen to this recording<BR>don't know of the existence of ambient music, they think Radiohead are the only ones who produce these sounds. But people who have listened to other ambient artists, they see that this is just an easy way for Radiohead to chip in with the electronical music hype.<br />Buy a cd from Muse or Boards of Canada instead.<br />If you try and mix ambient with rock -- wich I don't see as a real good combination anyway -- then do it good.
B00005JKNF|3.0|I can't say anything that hasn't already been said, so I'll be brief.<BR>PRO's:<BR>- Extremely faithful atmosphere.  Excellent cinematography.<br />CON's:<BR>- Too damn long with no good reason to be so.<BR>- Muddy sound.  The British characters seem to spend most of their time mumbling to themselves. You'll need to turn subtitles on to follow the story.<BR>- The story is just not that imaginative or good.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I was not ever swept up the Harry Potter whirlwind of hype, but after watching this movie I can see why many were.  This is a well-done movie, safe for kids and with a good message.  Some people were accusing this movie of being from the devil, I would say just from a smart author and a great director.  I will watch the next movie and probably the one after that.<br />The acting in this movie was at a high-caliber, including the child actors.  There are some real strong veteran actors who support this young contingent of stars.  The special effects in this movie were out-of-this world, and it really was enjoyable to watch.<br />Thanks to the producers for bringing this movie to the screen.
0385486804|3.0|I finished Into the Wild a couple of days ago, and I'm still not quite sure what to think. If you've gotten this far, you probably already know the premise: Christopher McCandless, a (questionably) intelligent young man abruptly leaves his old life behind to tramp around the country. Ultimately, he winds up in Alaska and, as a result of pure happenstance or dismally poor preparation on his part, ends up starving to death.<br />My problem is that Krakauer can't seem to decide where the story is. Approximately half of the book is devoted to McCandless' story: where he went, what he did, and speculations on why he did it. Ultimately, we're left with more questions than answers about McCandless, but this is to be expected when the man is no longer here to answer questions or provide clarification. The remainder of the book is split between too-brief glimpses of McCandless' friends and family (generally a page or two of background, a few quotes, and a physical description), Krakauer's personal history, and his personal speculations on what drives people to such extreme circumstances.<br />At the end, I felt like I knew plenty about Krakauer and virtually nothing about McCandless beyond the facts. And what are the facts? We know that Krakauer conducted interviews and looked at McCandless' diary in the course of his research, but oftentimes we have no indication where his \\"facts\\" are coming from and therefore have no way of distinguishing them from speculation. All I know is what Krakauer wants us to think, and I'm left wondering if the purpose of the book is to characterize McCandless (in which case I don't think it succeeded) or if McCandless provides the backdrop upon which Krakauer exorcises his own demons.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I got this movie for one reason alone.  The video of Cyndi Laupers song to the movie.  Boy was it worth it.  It is a mini movie about 15 minutes long and not included in her Video collection DVD.  It has all the old wrestlers like Captain Lou Albano , Andre the Giant, Iron Sheak, and Roudy Rod Piper.  It is very comical ond you see her personality break out.  Besides the hard to find video.  I was surpised to see a great movie which everyone knows is a classic.  Also included is a second version of the movie with the cast talking over it and saying funny comments abou tthe movie as they made it. Nice to see what they look like now.  Overall a great DVD for the collection.
B000053VAF|5.0|This is without a doubt the best film by Kevin Smith,EVER!I mean,who else would make a big soldier made of poo.I think Jay and Silent Bob are so funny.That cast is an allstar cast.Jay and Silent Bob are like the Chiche and Chong's of our time.George Carlin is so funny on HBO,he should have had a bigger part.Poo king was the best actor of all the actors,he's Kicking butt left and right,it's awsome.Ben Affleck is like the best actor ever,he's is so cool he's like The Rock only not a wrestler.Matt Damon,he's cool I mean he is Ben Affleck's partner.Know we get to the best actor of all time Jason Lee...
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Many others have detailed the awesome badness of this film, so I won't list all the numerous problems Michael Bay has brought to the screen, however, two things trouble me after watching this disaster last night.<br />1. The same Japanese actors played the same roles in 1970's Tora! Tora! Tora!  You'd think somebody'd promoted them by now.  But maybe the Japanese Imperial Fleet is a slow-promoting organization.<br />2. As a father, I can definately tell you that somebody with Kate Beckinsale's figure who has conceived in December would not be wearing a tight dress in April.  Nor would she still be in the Navy in 1942.<br />Armmegdon was so much fun.  What happened here?  I suppose messing with the future is easier than messing with the past.<br />I blame Michael Bay. This movie is so bad for so long.  A Director's cut?  What did he leave out? Guadalcanal? Tarawa? Monte Casino? Why not show Hiroshima where we showed the world what happens when you disrupt our back nine on Sunday morning?
B000066AXE|5.0|I've seen this film 4 times already; twice in the theatre, and twice on rented DVD.  It never loses its appeal.  Ron Howard's impeccable direction keeps you guessing for most of the movie as to whether Nash's delusions are real or imagined.  Jennifer Connelly presented the strong, supportive role of Nash's wife.  She brought to light the dangers she and her infant son faced, as well as the heartache of watching her husband's condition deteriorate.  Russell Crowe's performance was outstanding.  I believe it's his best work yet.  His missing out on an Oscar is unforgivable.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This is definately her best concert since she had more hits by now.  I really enjoy the different versions of all her songs and the moves.  She is a great dancer and although alot of the songs are lip synced it does not matter because i do not know anyone who can dance like that and keep a not.  Her voice is shown in Her slower songs.  If you really want her to sing you can not see her dance well.  Madonna did it, Janet Jackson did it so why not Britney.  The concert is excellent and critics need to base it on a professional level not a personal level.  Well overall it is very entertaining.  Great for a party, to play in the background while you have fun.  Buy the DVD.
B00000IQC8|2.0|I don't think this is bad because it is porley made,just because it's not funny.Kevin Smith wasn't being a genius here.I don't get it ,the rest of Kevin Smith's movie's are great.I think it's because he was just starting his directing career.I think the funniest person in that movie was Randall.I think it's funny that he works at the video store and never goes in,I think he was funnier in the cartoon series.I think Dontay is funny in the movie but a little to serious,but of course Brian O'Halloran has been in every Kevin Smith movie.Jay I think is the funniest part of this...comedy,he is funny in every movie he's in.Kevin Smith is not funny because he dosen't do anything but not talk and stand outside the Quick Stop.Once again it is Kevin Smith's worst movie.
B000002UAC|4.0|\\"With The Beatles\\" is definetly an important album for the Beatles because they were becoming more than just a lucky band that could write a few hit songs. They were developing as writers and performers.<br />\\"It Won't Be Long\\"- This fiery album full of energy starts off with a bang with the feel-good rocker \\"It Won't Be Long\\". If this song was in stereo it would sound amazing but sadly this entire album is in mono. Perhaps it is for the better (the reason the first four Beatles albums were in mono is because it sounds fuzzy on most songs when they hit high notes in stereo).<br />\\"All I've Go To Do\\"- This soft tune is simply marvellous because of its simple structure. The harmony vocals are nothing more than the same words as the lead and the last verse is a combination of the first two. It is played in essentially the same tempo, making this song less complex than \\"From Me To You\\".<br />\\"All My Loving\\"- An all-time favorite of mine, \\"All My Loving\\" is also a simple song with a mix of rock and country in its guitar solo and superb harmonies.<br />\\"Don't Bother Me\\"- George Harrison's first song, this is a great fast-paced and sort of haunting tune with a great upbeat feel but with dark lyrics. An amazing start to the songwriting career of one of the greatest musicians of all time. Simply a stunning start for a songwriting career.<br />\\"Little Child\\"- One of the simplest of Beatles songs. This is like \\"Please Please Me\\"'s \\"Misery\\" in it being the shortest track, but sitll a simple but catchy tune. <br />\\"Till There Was You\\"- The first cover song on this album. Paul sings this with great soul and emotion. He never strays out of key and seems to strive for perfection in this recording.<br />\\"Please Mister Postman\\"- A great American song with the best possible blend of harmonies and lead vocals. It's hard to duplicate the energy put into this take of this excellent upbeat song. The explosive intro and the blend of vocals makes this one of the best executed songs on any Beatles album.<br />\\"Roll Over Beethoven\\"- A perfect Chuck Berry cover. While other Chuck Berry songs such as \\"Johnny B Goode\\" or \\"I Got to Find My Baby\\" would have been fine alternatives to this song on this album but they wouldn't set the pace for the B-side of the album like this song did on record. Gotta love that guitar intro!<br />\\"Hold Me Tight\\"- A great song with great vocals that may sometimes stray out of key but I think it is beneficial to have \\"It's you-oo-hoo-hoo-hoo, you, you ,you-oo-hoo-hoo-hoo\\"s that don't sound the same every time. An upbeat song with feel-good vocals and harmonies. One of the greater songs on this album.<br />\\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\\"- A marvellous interpretation of Smokey Robinson and The Miracles classic. I think The Beatles do it better on this than Smokey's version! After listening to all of The Beatles' albums you'll remember listening to this song.<br />\\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\"- Probably one of the most fast-paced and energetic song on the album (except for perhaps \\"It Won't Be Long\\", but that's disputable). I've never heard The Rolling stone's version of this song but I like this one well enough. Ringo probably has the best voice for it (except, perhaps, for Mick Jagger, which may be the reason John and Paul wrote this song for them). <br />\\"Devil in Her Heart\\"- Another American song with the perfect blend of harmonies and lead vocals. I can't imagine anyone doing this better than The Beatles. George was the right one to sing lead because his voice fits perfectly into the role of the love- blinded guy who can't see that his girl intends bad (not that George is like that).<br />\\"Not A Second Time\\"- This song is great and sounds even better in stereo. I love the simplicity and catchiness of this track, and again, another of those classic Beatles upbeat feeling song with dark lyrics.<br />\\"Money (That's What I Want)\\"- A perfect rocking end for \\"With The Beatles\\". Another perfectly executed blend of leads and harmonies. The opening guitar/piano part is one of the best and catchiest introductions to any song you'll ever hear. The irresistable way John says \\"That's what I want\\" fits perfectly into it along with the back-ups. Money may buy happiness for John but on the next album we find Paul feels differently (I'm not sure if that entire sentence was true but John picked this song to play and Paul wrote \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" so I had to say it).<br />All in all \\"With The Beatles\\" is a great album but it gets four stars and not five because The Beatles still had far greater material, although this is still a great album and a must-have for any Beatles fan. For a fan of music that's a bit more complex, check out \\"Abbey Road\\" or \\"The Beatles\\", but this album should not be overlooked!
B00005QDW1|5.0|Rock Steady is a wonderful album! This is the first one that I have bought, and definetly won't be the last! I love every song on this cd, except for Rock Steady, and it's still not terrible! My favorite songs are In My Head (it's hillarius!), Making Out 'it's cute), Detective (it's sweet and sad), and Start The Fire (it's just cool). If you don't own it, you really should! This cd is one of my favorites! <BR>~Chelsi~
B000068TP0|5.0|WOw i can not believe it has been three years since this was first seen on latin tv here in new york.  I did think it is wierd they never released it.  I guess it was a matter of time.  It is funny because she was 22 in this video and you even see in her personality how different she is.  Now she is much more mature and more of a performer but even back then her voice was awesome.  All the songs are found on the same cd and it is just great the way a lot of the songs have a different beat then the original.  It is also good cause she interacts with the audience and not in a typical concert format that is so fake but an original person view.  She lights up the stage and the people love her.  If you wanna see her move her hips like she does in the last track ojos asi, buy it.
B00000063U|5.0|A marvelous album from 1974 chocked full of Richard Thompson's wry observations on life's outsiders . The ten songs are amongst Richard Thompson's best work , and they're enhanced further by the imaginative choice of instruments that are played . The use of the Dulcimer , Anglo Concertina , Krummhorn and Accordion gives this cd a dark quasi-English medieval ambiance that fits hand in glove with the almost Gothic imagery and dark language of the songs . As usual Richard Thompson's guitar playing is inspired , and the underrated Linda Thompson has one of her finest moments on the magnificent \\" Withered and Died \\" , surely one of the great songs on \\" lost love \\" out there !<br />I've had this record for twenty years now , and it still keeps getting better , because from time to time I still discover hidden nuances that not only enhances the record but also highlights the depth of this stunning music . Essential !<br />...
B000066I6N|5.0|This album has a similar sound to his &quot;Fate of Nations&quot; CD. &quot;Darkness, Darkness&quot; and &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; really display his unique solo sound nicely. I saw him perform some of these songs in Chicago, and you can hear how his voice has improved with age. I only wish &quot;Sitting by the Window&quot; was included on this CD. He does a great cover of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and the blues sound really comes through on &quot;Red Dress&quot;. Well worth the 9 year wait.
B000002G30|3.0|What's so special about this genre of music? It's loud. The guitars and drums collide to make sounds that no other kind of music can. I like to think that Black Sabbath used to mix the sound of breaking wine bottles in with their cymbals on their records. The bass drives the sound, and the vocalist screams bloody murder.<br />This album? Not so much. If you're a fan of Monster Magnet, and have been since before this album debuted, you know exactly what I mean. The Spine of God LP wacked me in the side of the head and left me deaf for a day or two. The Superjudge album is currently the only CD I listen to in my car, and I'm on my third copy of the album because of wear and tear. At the end of the Superjudge album is a song called Black Balloon where the smash and grab metal is left behind for a trippy sitar (sp?) and bongo ode. This album is more of that style than the loud and juicy sex metal that blessed us on the two prior LPs. I don't like this, save a few songs. <br />If you want a good Monster Magnet album, go out and get Superjudge. It's one of the best metal albums ever recorded. I can't stop listening to it, it's really excellent. The Amazon reviewer for this album is flexing his 80's metal tour trivia knowledge more than his appreciation for this record. It sounds like he never heard the older stuff.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Okay, so this album will not appeal to as big an audience as the first 2, but it is artistically the most impressive.<br />01. \\"Im A Slave 4 U\\"- it isn't the best song.  It isn't as bad the more you listen, but it's my least favorite song on the CD.  B-<br />02.  \\"Overprotected\\"- One of her typical pop songs to appease the fans.  Very fun, and honest.  B+<br />03.  \\"Lonely\\"- Has a good rhythm and will have you dancing in no time.  B+<br />04.  \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\"- Perhaps the most meaningful song on the whole CD.  It is one of my favorites.  A<br />05.  \\"Boys\\"- It is pretty good.  Very sexy and easily describes many people's thoughts.  A-<br />06.  \\"Anticipating\\"- A simple feel good song.  The type of song that lifts your mood totally.  A<br />07.  \\"I Love Rock N' Roll\\"- Perhaps her best cover song to date.  This song has been begging to be covered for years.  B+<br />08.  \\"Cinderella\\"- My favorite song on the CD.  Very catchy melody and perhaps Britney's best lyrics.  A<br />09.  \\"Let Me Be\\"- Very good melody.  B<br />10.  \\"Bombastic Love\\"- Quite a good song.  Just listen for the good hooks.  B+<br />11.  \\"That's Where You Take Me\\"- Another feel good song.  Just plain irresistible.  A<br />12.  \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\"-  Goes along with track 1 as my least favorite song on the CD.  Justin Timberlake is not a good songwriter at all, but Britney's singing carries the whole thing.  B-<br />All and all, this is the best Britney album.  She has come into her own, and proven herself as more mature.  Despite the 2 bad choices, this is an irresistible collection of songs.  Get it, and it will never leave your CD player.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|I really looked forward to seeing this -- and boy was I disappointed.  A visual treat -- and the idea of quoting pop songs is cute.  But it doesn't work.  It's too sappy, trite, arch -- whatever.  I couldn't sit still, it made me fidgety.  Fact is, I got BORED!  Next day, we saw Cabaret, with Joel Grey and Liza.  Night and day!  WOW!
0060506989|4.0|Compelling precisely because it is not like a novel.  It's an after battle report, and it's a good one.  The authors were there.  It shows.<br />This book takes you step by step through the preparations for, and the details of, one of the first and deadliest battles in Vietnam.  It does so through the eyes of the commander in the field, one who had great respect for the men in his command, and the men (especially some helicopter pilots) who supported them.<br />It bogs down occasionally, but even that is welcome since it is usually the relating of individual soldiers age's, hometown's, and family details that makes sure everyone is remembered for the effort and sacrifice they made.<br />The book also carries a battlefield commander's appraisal of larger political questions of government support of the effort and the troops, restrictions on movement or pursuit, and the decision to maintain the regular enlistment period (and let go of the best trained men) and rigid 'tour' of men, and the 'ticket stamping' rotation of officer's combat assignments.<br />These are valid questions, and should be debated much more than they ever will be.  They also detract from the relation of the battle (actually battles) that were fought, and the 'fog of war' that existed.<br />The book shows the pride of a professional soldier and the respect he has for his enemy.  Both viewpoints frequently missing in a typical novel.<br />Well worth the effort.  Read it.
0380820846|3.0|I rushed out to buy this book the day it was released, because Julia Quinn's are usually the most reliably well-written romances.  However, I found this one to be someone draggy - the first fifty pages will bore anyone already familiar with the Bridgerton family - and lacking in a \\"momentum event\\" (ie, stangers meet, a death occurs, etc). Penelope, with her long-unrequited love for the selfish dilettante Colin, and her submission to her abusive mother, comes across as a doormat/drip.  I look forward to the next book in the series, which will feature the (much more dynamic) heroine, Eloise Bridgerton.
B00005NEUF|1.0|I disliked them from the first time I saw Last Night on MTV2.  But I'm open minded enough to listen to the entire CD with some friends who are big fans.  It made me like them even less.  They are even less talented than Godsmack, if that's even possible.  I recommend that if you are a fan of meaningful, original music, you should avoid this album at all cost.
B00005LQ04|4.0|Most of you probably already know whether or not you want to own this flick.  So i'm just going to offer a few words of advice:  DON'T WATCH IT ON A PLAYSTATION 2!!!   About 4 minutes and 10 seconds into chapter 6 the screen will turn green and digitized and remain that way until you either eject the disc or hit \\"reset.\\"  Ironically, the film is psychedelic enough without the inclusion of this odd glitch.  I have tried two copies of the disc on the machine and both suffered from the same problem.  If you fast forward through the 4 minute 10 second mark in chapter 6 you will be able to bypass the problem, however.<br />Other than that, this hallucinatory and dreamlike film is quite cool, but definitely not for everyone.  Mainstream audiences (don't expect anything resembling \\"Scream\\") will probably be put off by glaring displays of illogic and a lack of concrete explanations for everything that transpires in the film.  What you can expect is a trippy rollercoaster ride through a colorful funhouse of various shocks.
B00003CXA2|1.0|THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN.<BR>IT TRIES SO HARD TO DEAL WITH OTHERWISE MEANINGFUL ISSUES.<BR>HOWEVER, IT FAILS ON ALL OF THEM.<BR>OVER RATED ACTOR T.HANKS IS AT HIS USUAL WORST.<BR>AVOID IT!
B00000DCHI|5.0|Looking for a \\"Best Of\\" compilation from Billy Joel? As of 2002 you have 4 main ones to choose from. The \\"Box Set - Complete Hits Collection\\" set is extensive at 4 discs worth... and probably too much for the average buyer. The best of titled \\"Volume 3\\" has the latter hits from the 1990's (and nothing from the 1970's or early 80's). The \\"Essential\\" (released in 2001) is a good collection, and it features a handful of songs that are not featured on \\"Vol I & II\\" (i.e. \\"Miami 2017\\", \\"Honesty\\", \\"An Innocent Man\\", A Matter Of Trust\\"). In my opinion, all of these collections are good, and it just depends on which era of Billy Joel you prefer. If you like all his stuff (1970's thru 2000), then maybe \\"Essential\\" is for you. If you got into Billy Joel late - then his \\"Volumne III\\" might be the best choice. If you were a fan of Billy Joel thru the 1970's and early 80's (\\"Piano Man\\", \\"Turnstiles\\", \\"The Stranger\\", \\"52nd Street\\", \\"Glass Houses\\", etc), and then lost interest in the 1990's due to the sappy crap he was putting out (like I did), then this \\"Greatest Hits - Volume I & II\\" (from 1985) is an easy pick. You will find key songs here that are not featured on \\"Essential\\" - like \\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\", \\"Big Shot\\", \\"The Stranger\\", \\"Pressure\\". If you need further proof of this double disc's validity... check out Amazon's review of Billy Joel's essential (must have!) recordings. \\"Vol I & II\\" is the ONLY hits collection mentioned... it's also at the top of the list. This release will not disappoint.
B00005NW02|5.0|System of a Down have grown since their last CD, making one move that always surprises me in the upmost way- they removed the Parental Advisory Sticker. That is especially good for because - although I don't mind it - I'd rather there be no swearing, as I see it as pointless and just to get immature kids to listen to your music. That aside, I'll talk about the Album.<br />Musically this CD- although a tad softer than their self titled- is very heavy, and exceptionally good. The vocals are equally as heavy, although pleasingly weird in some parts. The lyrics tackle things from the Prison System (Prison Song), to Spousal Abuse leading to suicidal (Chop Suey!) to Cocaine Crazed Groupies attempting to change their ways (Physcho). This is easily my current favourite CD, and is a must have.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|recently i sat down and watched &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; for the first time. i don't usually like movies about &quot;real life&quot;, i'm a sci-fi buff. the performance of Russell Crowe was the most brillient performance by an actor that i have ever seen. without that performance no one would have received an academy award.
B00005JKL8|4.0|This movie introduces Owen Wilson in the world of action stars.  It is a different role than what he's used to, that be a comedic role in such films as \\"Shanghai Noon\\", \\"Meet the Parents\\", \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" and \\"Zoolander\\" to name a few.  In the end, he makes a great transition to this genre.<br />This is basically a war thriller that keeps it pretty simple.  He's an American pilot shot down in Eastern Europe, and he's trying to survive until help can get to him.  The filming adds some Matrix-esque slowed down reality filming, and there's also some playing around with the audio, similar to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" after being shell-shocked.<br />Other than that, the film is a straight-forward, entertaining film.  There is also a minor performance by Gene Hackman which is nothing special, but he adds to the whole of the movie.<br />All in all, this is an enjoyable movie that moves quickly and is always keeping your attention with action and drama...a good film.
B00005RDAF|3.0|Although this Dvd isn\\"t bas it\\"s not god either. It\\"s just too short. There are three good performances of I\\"m Slave For You, I\\"m Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman and Overprotected, 2 great videos and commercials and behind the scens and that\\"s it! Buy it only if you\\"re a real fan.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|The uninitiated are encouraged to pick up Rufus' self-titled debut before delving into Poses - not, though, because the latter is incapable of standing on its own merit; it is a work of art, unquestionably. But part of the thrill of Poses lies in the growth it charts for the artist and the continued evolution of his craft, already formidable on the first album.<br />The opening track of Poses, &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot;, is a perfectly fitting segue, and one that would have fit snugly into his stunning debut. Humourous and self-deprecating, the lyrics document the singer's penchant for all things harmful, lumping fattening foods and love into the same picnic basket. Just try to get this song out of your head. As melodically rich as the food he laments, this and the other twelve tracks on the album deftly stir intelligent, well-crafted, pop-savvy melodies into a tantalizing melange, topped off by the author's superb lyrics.<br />His tendency for the grandiose is constantly tempered by an obvious and beautifully implemented appreciation for classic pop, and the ghost of the Beatles rears it's gorgeous head more than a few times, though none more clearly than on the captivating &quot;Grey Gardens&quot;. Like &quot;April Fools&quot; on the debut album, the Fabs themselves would have been hardpressed to keep from liking this one. <br />Though it reflects and embraces much of its spirit, the album is huge in its sweep and reaches far beyond Sixties pop. Indeed, there was a clear intention of stepping in to the new millenium, bringing along more upbeat and (dare I say) danceable tunes. Wainwright has made no secret of  the fact that he would like to step out of the coffee house circuit. He just wants to hear his songs played on the radio, folks. And there are a couple of attempts here to achieve this end, most of them quite successful. If there is one mistep on the album it is the &quot;remix&quot; of &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; that closes thedisc. Silly and unnecessary, it tries just a little too hard to be hip.<br />Taken in its entirety, though, the album is one of the year's definite best, and will likely stand the test of time as an enduring work. If Wainwright continues to grow and excel in his songwriting, we may truly be witnesses to the birth of one of the greats.
B000066AXE|5.0|I can not praise A Beautiful Mind highly enough.  It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Russell Crowe was robbed of a very much deserved oscar.
B00005UKKF|5.0|Wow! This is what concert DVD&quot;s should always be like. This is great concert. The dancing, the stage, the outfits are great! The concer includes these songs:Oops! I Did It Again!, You Drive Me Crazy, Overprotected, Born To Make You Happy, Lucky, Sometimes, Boys, Stronger, I&quot;m Not A girl Not Yet A Woman, I Love Rock&quot;n&quot;Roll, What&quot;s It Like To Be Me, Lonely, Don&quot;t Let Me Be The Last To Know, Anticipiating, I&quot;m A Slave For You and Baby One More Time. There are also bonus videos and a movie trailer. Great!
B000002ADT|5.0|Without a doubt one of the greatest albums ever compiled in the 20th century. Miles Davis sound transcends jazz in any form, style or era. Before Him, there was none greater than Charlie &quot;Bird&quot; Parker, but Davis' meloncholy,&quot;blue&quot; sound is what sets him apart. His trumpet releases poetic notes of emotion laced passion. The prime example of such is without a doubt &quot;Blue In Green&quot;. The song just emotes the&quot;hurts so good&quot; type of sadness combined with the marriage of love &amp; heartache.<BR>The classic cut,&quot;So What&quot; really needs no description. It is the albums first song for a reason. Kind Of Blue must have truely been made in heaven because it is hard to believe that something so beautiful could be made here on earth!
1573222038|5.0|Right from an early reference to Oliver Twist it's clear that this is indeed Dickens updated for a new century. The squalor of Victorian England is vividly portrayed here, but Waters' page turner of a plot takes us further, to the dirty corners of society even Dickens didn't dare to investigate - lunatic asylums and pornographers' libraries. The setting convinces and the themes of greed, betrayal and love are ably handled. Pigeonholers could call this a 'lesbian novel' - again a theme unexplored by Dickens - but *Fingersmith* is much more than this, and anyone who likes reading should try it.
B00005LMBK|5.0|The Gorillaz featuring some amazing vocals from the tight off the hook del the funky homosapien come at you live from England.  This is one of the hottest albums of the year.  Why?  because you don't have to look for art in it.  You just sit back and listen.  The M1/A1 beginning reminds us all that Zombies are real, and that music has respected them, movies have respected them, why shouldn't we.  Besides all that, there is more to this cd than meets the eye.  Like bong noises, and yelling.  Why can't we get along when you hear a cd like this I'll tell you WHY!  BEcause this CD IS FABOLOUS!
0553328255|5.0|The Sherlock Holmes stories are thoroughly entertaining and perfect for that long summer vacation. Over the course of reading them, you will immerse yourself in Victorian London, get to know the moody and brilliant Homes as well as you would a dear friend, solve (more likely, watch Holmes solve) clever mysteries, and be taken away to a world that will soon become more familiar to you than your own neighborhood. I have read these stories several times in my life and am now doing so again this summer. For 12$, I can't imagine a better, more economic entertainment. Most of the stories are excellent. A few strain the tacit agreement with the reader because they deliberately set you up to think one way and then pull the rug out from under you as the conclusion goes in a different direction. But this is quibbling. If you are looking for entertainment with a just bit of tweaking of your intellect, the Holmes stories will more than reward your investment!
6300216543|5.0|Seeing this film was the major decision-making factor in my becoming a police officer some 23+ years ago. What greater compliment could I pay?<BR> <BR>Assuming that the real Frank Serpico was accurately depicted, my estimation of that man has, if anything, doubled as a result of my years as a cop, trying in my own way to follow in those grand footsteps. Pacino simply nails the walking-on-eggshells, lone-wolf, and frankly courageous aspects of the character. The perfectly realised portrayal of the concommitant self-destructive turmoil which poisons Serpicos personal relationships as an almost inevitable result, should have garnered him with the Best Actor Oscar that year. A young and brilliant Pacino at his stone-best before he started caricaturising himself.<br />Lumet at his zenith. If you love Lumets directing, please seek out the hidden gem &quot;Lovin' Molly&quot; from about circa 1974 starring Blythe Danner, Anthony Hopkins and Beau Bridges. Trust me, it will affect you.<br />'Serpico' has lost none of it's impact despite being close to 30 years old. Please rent it, buy it, or, if you are truly brave, live it.<br />(The score and cinematography are also excellent. And the cardboard box that the videotape comes in makes an excellent source of dietary fibre.)
6302820448|3.0|Groundhog Day has a great deal of potential, but ultimately fails to live up to its promise. It isn't the concept that falls short; on the contrary, the plot is entertainingly original. Self-centred reporter Phil Connors aims to leave Pennsylvanian backwater Punxsutawney as soon as possible after completing a story on the annual Groundhog Day Festival, but his plans are thwarted when he wakes the following morning and discovers that it's Groundhog Day again. . . . . . . . . . and again. . . . . . . . . . Initially he sees this turn of events as akin to a nightmare, but soon realises that if there's no tomorrow, there are no hangovers and no consequences. . . . . . . . . .<br />A storyline like this is very amusing per se, and there are some deft touches - such as Phil's audacious money-van heist, which succeeds simply because after innumerable Groundhog Days in succession, he knows Punxsutawney's routines so well. Due to the inherent comedy, Bill Murray's wisecracking attempts as Phil are unnecessary, they don't fit well with his character, and frankly someone making a face like a groundhog isn't that funny the first time, let alone meriting repetition. <br />Although this is a comedy there are some genuinely thought-provoking issues raised - Phil learns (and through him we realise) that spontaneity can never be choreographed, and an impulsive moment's beauty lies in the fact that it 'just happens'. The film's biggest downfall is its predictability. Despite the various entertaining shenanigans en route, we just know that in the end Phil will have learned some Valuable Lessons and become a Nice Guy. <br />Overall though, Groundhog Day is a likeable movie, and would leave the viewer with a much greater sense of satisfaction had it - instead of showing the happy couple running hand-in-hand through the freshly fallen snow - used a less trite finale.
0316666343|5.0|For any parent of a murdered child this fresh book will bring comfort along with tears and joy.  Written from a perspective of a young teenage girl, newly murdered, and her journey from her ties to earth, her observations of family and the tracking of her murderer in search for justice for herself and for her grief stricken family to her progress in &quot;her&quot; Heaven.  In the literary world this viewpoint is new and enlightening.  Every reader will find comfort in the thought that &quot;hey, this could be.&quot;<br />Susie Salmon is a character we will not forget.
0743424425|5.0|I am amazed at how many people put reviews here of this book and DID NOT read it. THERE WAS NO MAZE OF SHRUBS IN THE BOOK!!! The movie [disappointed]! It was the worst. As SK himself said Jack Nicholson was horrible in the movie. He was too old and everyone knows he's already crazy so who would be surprised to see him go crazy. READ THE BOOK. Someone said the book took them away fora few hours and that the maze of shrubs was chilling. HE DIDN'T READ THE BOOK! What happens in the book is far more scary than in the movie. READ THE BOOK!! A hundred years from now this will still be around and still be a classic. WONDERFUL!!!
6305159432|3.0|A lot of words have been spent describing, criticizing or simply discarding this movie. Pity, after all it's an inoffensive adventure movie a la Tarzan and as such it should be considered.<br />My three stars go out to the poor bushman who probably played himself and didn't get mentioned in the credits.<br />He's actually the reason why this movie is worth watching. All the rest is cheap anti-communism propaganda of the lowest and brainless level.<br />The director seems to tell us \\"Hey guys, the Communists got it up their a... in Afghanistan and in Africa too, so why should we blame our boys for having lost the Vietnam War?\\".<br />The script came from a spoiled child with too much time to do something useful with it.<br />And yet, despite all the \\"propaganda\\" bit, \\"Red Dawn\\" it is not... if you know what I mean. Thank God for that!<br />It's the simple story of a Spetnaz (the russian equivalent to Special Forces in the U.S. Army or the S.A.S. in the British Army) who gets an assignment as an undercover hitman to kill an African rebel leader.<br />Unfortunately for him, once in the midst of the Rebel group he starts to understand why they revolt and sympathises with their cause.<br />Bad mistake! He's captured by the Russian secret service, tortured and thrown out of the Spetnaz with dishonor.<br />Abandoned in the midst of an unknown African wilderness, he's suddenly confronted with the harshness of the land and must learn very fast how to survive in it.<br />Unfortunately for him some lessons learned are soon forgotten thanks to exhaustion and sleepiness. In fact, no sooner is he asleep that a very venomous scorpion decides to sting him.<br />The real movie starts here. Will he survive or not? Well, thanks to the said Bushman he gets his skin saved for a little longer.<br />At first, the giant Lundgren mocks the little man for being so primitive and so backward and seems to take pleasure at teasing him, despite his gratefulness for having being saved by the Bushman.<br />Very soon though the positions get reversed, and this is the really interesting plot twist of the movie. Lundgren is not a great actor, or even an actor at all, but in his clumsiness and genuine naivete' he gets through in convincing us about his helplessness out there in the wild.<br />Soon enough the wisdom of the old Bushman gets revealed to him and now a true friendship starts to ensue between two worlds as alien and as far apart as can be.<br />Not only do they become friends but start to respect each other as human beings, and out of this relationship comes the final strong reaction of Lundgren when he sees that the Bushman's entire village, family and friends have been wildly butchered by so-called \\"civilized\\" people. Lungren's own bunch.<br />While the Bushman hardly utters a word watching the scene and seems to linger in a state of deep shock at what he sees, Lundgren gets upset and swears to the old man that his family won't have died in vain.<br />A noble reaction, but probably one the Bushman wouldn't accept, also because it is not in his nature.<br />From here on the movie returns to his old actioner cliche' of Rambo's fame.<br />Naturally, somebody must have had some doubts on how to end the movie, but such doubts didn't last very long... Pity!<br />Lundgren seems more comfortable acting with the Bushman than surrounded by professional actors and at his level it is more than comprehensible. This is also where he is at his best.<br />So, in conclusion, if you are a Tarzan fan, this movie comes very close to that genre, with a touch of Rambism and a touch of Italian Stave Reeves' Hercules you may be served.<br />If you thought about a deep movie, this is absolutely not it.<br />It's pure escapism with a touch of sprinkled Pathos on top.<br />I would still recommend it just for the poor Bushman who did his job with honesty and generosity.<br />If you are an actor or a Drama student watch him carefully because you may still learn a thing or two about how an amateur can sometimes steal the show from a professional, despite his training and upbringing.<br />I only wished somebody someday will finally retrace the Bushman's name and include it on the DVD or VHS tape cover. He deserves it more than Lundgren...ut how an amateur can sometimes steal the show from a professional, despite his training and upbringing.<br />I only wished somebody someday will finally retrace the Bushman's name and include it on the DVD or VHS tape cover. He deserves it more than Lundgren...
B000067CPX|1.0|I want my money back!  RHCP ripped me off!  I'll describe this CD in two words and one sound:  Weak, boring and ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  What happened to your instruments guys?  Don't get me wrong, I've liked every RHCP CD to date even One Hot Minute, but after struggling to listen to this CD 3 times, I had to play Californication just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.  Gone are the great guitar parts and good drum playing; in are the bad lyrics and sleepy uninspired music.  I hope the RHCP take an about face for their next CD and get back to some better writing - I don't expect hard funk, just good song writing with some inspiration to it.  I expected more after waiting 3 years.  What a bummer.
0385720920|5.0|Being a fan -- nay, worshipper, really -- of the movie Fight Club, and upon high recommendation from a friend who is also an enthusiast, I picked up \\"Choke\\" to help use up my gift certificate. Looking back now, it would've been worth full price.<br />WARNING: this book is nowhere near kids' stuff. There's sex, language, drug use -- if you're at all squeamish, you will be disturbed. But stick with it. You'll like it, I promise you.<br />Dude . . . just because it's a book doesn't mean it's not substance abuse. \\"Perfect\\" isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind. (That'll make sense later, trust me.)
B000067CPX|3.0|After Californication came out, which I consider to be RHCP's best album next to Blood Sugar, I was intensely excited to hear what they would do next.  Unfortunately, it sounds to me (and I emphasize that--TO ME) like they have realized that they can sell a lot of records by writing minor-key melancholy ditties.  It worked great in moderation on Calif., but here it seems to have taken over completely.  They just can't seem to have a good time anymore.  I understand the band has been through a lot--Kiedis's troubles staying off of heroin, Frusciante's similar troubles and his sometimes seeming brushes with sanity--but is it entirely difficult to find some glimmers of hope in the music you make?<br />That said, I cannot say that there are not some great moments on the disc.  The groove on By The Way is classic Chilis, as is Frusciante's amazing guitar line on Can't Stop.  Other moments (pardon the unintended pun) pepper the album as well, but it's weighted down by what appears to be a great deal of sweet &amp; sour rambling.  Let's hope the boys start to look up in the future.

6305313687|5.0|The very first time I started to watch this movie, I quit after 15 minutes or so. The level of racism set forth by Edward Norton at the begining is sickening and disturbing. Then a friend insisted that I watch the rest, then I got it...<br />Ed plays a white supremicist who, if he had joined the Germans in 1942, Hitler would have to tell him to calm down. His little brother idolizes him and, over time, becomes him, basically. Meanwhile, Ed goes to jail, where he's talked to by a black fellow prisoner who's stories and wit turn him around. The movie's plot is trying to turn his little brother's life around before it's too late.
B00005YU1O|5.0|i think most reviews of movies like this focus on the wrong thing. this is a film for a discriminating taste - one which appreciates irony, and one which is also capable of separating substance from diatribe. i see jim carrey movies as pretentious, not movies like this. 'my dinner with andre' had a further reach of accessability than this film - anyone with half a BA and half a sense of humor will love this trip to death.
B00006878K|5.0|Arguably the best sixties blues album now in terrific sound.  It lacks a couple songs included on 'King of the Blues', but blues fans will want to hear the richer sound on this disc.  Every track's a winner.
0553260111|5.0|Jason Bourne washes, shot and left for dead, is rescued from the sea. He has no memory of who is or how he got there, so he attempts to discover his past. He learns he is a trained killer and killers are now hunting for him. They'd like to see him dead. The plot spins on from there, and the plot is one of Mr. Ludlum's best. There's some romance. There's some danger. There's some action. Filled with detailed and intricate the plot is fast paced and action packed. The only down side to it, is it's near cliff hanger ending that pretty much expects you'll have the next chapter of the trilogy ready to go. <BR>Another great book, but of a different genre is The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock
0316666343|5.0|As I read Alice Sebold's masterful novel, The Lovely Bones, I was constantly reminded about the wounds that people hold.  While the book is based upon the most horrific of wounds-the rape and murder of Susie Salmon-in a larger sense, the story is about the wounds inflicted upon those around her.  Susie's death acts as a trigger, releasing pent up wounds in some cases, while opening fresh ones as well.  As Susie watches her family struggle with the holes in their lives, she too goes through a similar process, leading to an eventual healing and hopefulness.  We're reminded, it seems, that the delicate balance between a wound and its healing is always tenuous.  <br />I have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the power of Sebold's writing.  It is an engaging tour-de-force, one that grips you from beginning to end.  In fact, I found myself forcing myself to stop reading, in order to better savor Sebold's words.  I also found myself re-reading certain powerful paragraphs out loud, just to see how those words and sentences tasted when verbalized.  Alice Sebold's writing caused me to look at some words and phrases anew, in much the same way that Barbara Kingsolver's writing does.  There are few writers who I can compare favorably to Kingsolver.  Believe me, that's high praise.<br />There is a painful beauty in this book.  There is also sheer beauty.  In the end, Alice Sebold has created a book of characters that we care deeply for, and that's real beauty.
B00005OAIE|1.0|This album sounds like a frat boy trying to be sensitive.  Insanely generic.  Don't buy it unless you like sappy hot-tub jazz.  There is no soul in this album.
B000068QY7|2.0|This album is by far the weakest of all there previous efforts.  They have lost there way, except for 2-3 tracks, the cd on whole is weak and uninspired.  They have run out of ideas for songs and these seem rehashed.
6304057709|5.0|movie!! E. Thompson actually added to the humor of the story (at the same time making it quite a bit darker). We should all read Austen's books, but this movie adapt. is worth seeing again and again...
B000001GRE|5.0|THIS suits Boulez maybe better than any (Chailly, Abbado, Nagano and Salonen could compete a bit here -mayby) because this is Mahlers def. most modern, highly abstract piece. This was something Schoenberg, Berg and Webern was deeply impressed of and so am I.<br />Boulez and orchestra are in top shape here at this one. If you are unsure about Boulez and Mahler it is a safe and best choice grab this one no.7 AND no.6 (he also suceeds with no 1. and no.4 and \\"Das lied von der erde\\") but not so well at no.5 on this new DG cycle but THIS is something extraordinary and rember that this is a MODERN highly intellectual, sometimes groteque and fun, bizarre piece... not a \\"Esalen scream therapy\\" or a romantic piece.<br />Understand Mahler no.7 something like that I mention above and you be satisfied with this version.
B00005JL3A|3.0|So, the movie is supposed to be a prequel to the games... The story could easily work as a prequel to \\"Resident Evil\\" the video game. But the game takes place in September of 1998, and the movie takes place in \\"the early 21st century.\\" You'd think they might at least try for some continuity. Now even though the game is a bunch of soldiers in a big old house fighting Romero-esque zombies, when you play the game, you don't feel like it's such a ripoff. In interviews, Paul Anderson made me think he was doing a good job. I was wrong. EVERYTHING in this movie is [taken from] another movie. The character Rain is so [like] ALIENS's Vasquez they even bothered [copying] her partner, too. And that's along with 2001, The Matrix, and too many others for me to even think of. The only thing I thought was original turned out to be from the movie Cube. BUT!! If you are in a good, not too critical mood, the movie is a lot of fun. Sure, these people just died like 4 hours ago, why WOULDN'T they be wrotting??<BR>And Resident Evil wasn't a ZOMBIE game, it was a monster game. Many of the monsters were zombies. This is a zombie movie that happens to have 1 - count them - 1 monster in it. <BR>BUT!! Zombie dogs! For the first time ever I get to see zombie dobermans, and man that alone would make this movie worthwhile.. but it is a really good time if you just ignore the [other stuff]. Can't wait for the sequel.
B0000667RO|4.0|For me this collection is the kind that will hold allot of memories for allot of people. The look back of a childhood in 'Summer of 69' is a tale that everyone can relate to. The more easier listening songs on the album include 'I'm ready' and 'Inside Out'. There are many other notible tracks on the album but one it particular stands out. All I need to say is SIXTEEN weeks.<br />These are excellently put together by one of the greatest vocalists in rock history. This record definately belongs in every collection no matter what you like. Why not five stars? Simply because people wont go out and buy the albums.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John is undoubtedly a VERY talented singer/songwriter, and everytime I listen to this disc, I can't help but wonder where i've heard this kind of music before!  I hear influences from Squeeze and GoWest, to name 2 bands.  I'm sure there are others in there too, but they elude me at the moment.  This is NOT a bad thing.  Influences are good.  Don't get me wrong... this is one of the better releases of 2002 so far, up there with THE CHURCH 'After Everything Now This', and RUSH 'Vapor Trails', just to name 2 others.  Moreover, Sony did a great job with the recording/mastering quality, and listening to John's vocals float out at and through you on a high-end system is something special!  Would I buy his next release?  Absolutely!
B000065NG6|2.0|There are different ways to approach a subject as complex as Dune:<BR>You can either take the time to tell the story properly, which requires either a mini-series or a series of movies (a la Lord of the Rings). You can also boil the story down to the bare minimum and tell a very basic story, or you can do what they attempted to do here, which was to take the entire story and compress it into two hours.<BR>The end result, of course is similar to flying over Disneyland. Sure, you get an idea of what's going on, but you miss actually experiencing it.<BR>Dune is like that. Huge chunks of narrative exposition and brief, shallow storytelling that doesn't have the time to explore anything in depth.<BR>Save yourself. Read the books.
B000068OSK|1.0|I don't know what all the hoopla is with this band.  I gave them a chance, after my wife bought the CD, and wanted to yank the disc out of the player from the getgo!  The tunes are uninspiring and so basic, I thought I was listening to a bunch of grade schoolers slinging guitars!  If this is considered 'back to basics garage rock', give me The Hives and The Strokes over this anyday!  At least their songs are more memorable and musical.

B000056PWV|5.0|1954's REAR WINDOW is a brilliant study on voyeurism and insatiable curiosity. Wheelchair bound James Stewart spies on his neighbors in the courtyard from the window of his Greenwich Village apartment. Convinced that he has uncovered a murder, Stewart maintains his vigil with his society girlfriend (Grace Kelly) by his side. Hitchcock asks the viewer about the ethics of interpreting what goes on behind the closed doors of our neighbors, as his courtyard is an allegorical cross section of American society and mores during the 50s.
B00005KHJT|5.0|When I first saw this film at 14, I was astounded by how harrowing it could be. I do enjoy horror films, and this redefined the genre for me. This television edit was the first version I ever saw, so when I finally bought it on VHS and noted that it was missing some (personally deemed) crucial scenes, I was annoyed. It has taken Anchor Bay forever to release this, and I am glad they did. This is one of the best horror films ever made, and this is the definitive version.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I love this CD. I was a fan of this band even before \\"How You Remind Me\\", the first time I heard \\"Worthy To Say\\" off \\"The State\\" (which by the way is NOT their first album), I was hooked. This honestly doesn't break much new ground, but it does what it does very well. I never really get tired of it, \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" is a song everyone on earth can relate to, \\"Good Times Gone\\" experiments a little bit with great results, and on and on. Bottom line: just go buy it.
6305291446|5.0|You can't beat the original, but you can come damn close, and this one does. After suffering the pointless 3, the mediocre 4, and the abhorrent 5 and 6, we finally see the return of Jaime Lee Curtis in the role that made her popular. Laurie Strode's return is not just the only catch for this film. The great cast, including Josh Hartnett, Adam Arkin, and LL Cool J, fleshes out a wonderfully written script, as well as a feasible plot line. Michael and Laurie play off each other phenomenally, and we finally see Laurie become the heroine was always knew she should be. Overall, a must-see with a killer ending (no pun intended).
0446608955|5.0|this book is sooooooooooo good, i mean , i loved it, it made me cry, it made me smile...and it's really touching! READ IT
6305971099|1.0|Nothing beats the original Michael-kills-sister plot line, but 4 was plausable. We accepted that Laurie Strode had a daughter and then died. But what we cannot accept is this film. Dr. Loomis, the man who desperately wants to stop Michael, is conveyed as a lunatic himself in this film. Danielle Harris, who was remarkable in 4, is now reduced to a \\"mute\\" with no acting style what-so-ever. As for the rest of the cast, should I even mention the Barney Fife wannabe cops? I'm sure another reviewer will. Overall, the worst of the series.
0671027344|2.0|Although Chbosky's debut novel remained fairly engaging--mainly because of its quick pace and simplicity--the characters all fell into familiar types, rather than being specific and emotionally moving. This flaw unfortunately ruins much of the book considering it tries to pass as a character driven story. Part of the problem comes from the book's narrative form--it's written in epistolatory form by a 9th grader. Although Chbosky mimics a 9th grader's language well, he shoots the story in the foot because the description of characters and situations usually come from abstractions and generalizations, which takes away from the characters significantly because they don't come across as specific humans, but rather as general character formulas.<br />Take Charlie's love interest Sam (female). She's a senior whose main function in the story is to look pretty and be sensitive to Charlie's obnoxious naivity (he's 16 and his naivity fluctuates at Chbosky's will for no reason). Or take Sam's brother, Patrick, a young man who conforms to every gay cliche possible, making him infinitely vague and stereotypical (gay cliche's including his love for The Village People and Blondie, his public performances as a drag queen in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and his nightly adventures in \\"the local park\\" where gay men annonymously meet for sex. Anyone halfway educated about gays know that \\"the local park\\" cliche is laughably dated and unrealistic). Charlie is like an expanded description of how uneducated straight America views the gay community, which is odd considering this novel's potential popularity with teens.<br />Anyway, the rest of the characters are flat as well--the brooding father, the perfect football-star older brother, the nice English teacher who sees the \\"real\\" Charlie.<br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" attempts to be smart by bombarding the reader with all too familiar teenage angst. All in all, the book was a quick, easy read, but left me without lasting imagesdue to Chbosky's timidity with round characters and original storytelling.
B000001OAA|5.0|Yes.  One of the best.  I like it even more than Nirvana's &quot;NEVERMIND&quot; which Butch Vig also had a hand in making.  What can I say.  Every song on this album either rocks or takes you to a sultry place that only Shirley and the boys from the U.S. can take you.  &quot;Only When It Rains&quot; is probably one of the greatest rock songs ever written.   Yes, I'll repeat that... &quot;Only When It Rains&quot; is probably one of the best rock songs ever written.  And what's incredible is that they created another masterpiece after this album with Version 2.0.
B000003TAL|4.0|The amount of stars I've given this has nothing to do with how I feel about it, I just wanted to say something:<br />All of you people who fell in love with this album the first time you heard it,<br />stop lying.  This album isn't an easy first listen.  Like I've said, I just got it so I can't judge how much I'll like it once I listen to it more, but as of right now, I'm not that impressed. Which isn't that big of a deal, it takes a lot for a CD to blow me away on the first listen, but there's no way in hell that anyone could just fall in love with this CD immediately.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I did not want to see this movie. Even though it stars Tom Hanks, quite frankly, it sounded boring as all get-out. And maybe it could have been, with any other actor.<br />Who else but Tom Hanks can create and sustain a deep and personal relationship with a volleyball upon which he has drawn a face? Who else but Tom Hanks can nearly drown on a crude hand-built raft in high waves, looking for that same volleyball, calling its name and sobbing uncontrollably? Who else but Tom Hanks can have you sobbing with him?<br />I won't review the plot here, since so many other reviewers have done so--and done it well. What I want to concentrate upon is Hanks' truly extraordinary acting ability. As we watch him change from cocky Fed-Ex manager extraordinaire to severely shaken plane crash survivor, to a marooned castaway on a desert island, we are drawn to him simply by the look on his face. Hanks moves from fear to frustration to anger to illness to vulnerability to joy to fear again...all the human emotions, conveyed seemingly effortlessly from a set that we know provided endless hardships for cast and crew.<br />There are innumberable scenes that are unforgettable for the sheer strength of his acting: the above-mentioned grief over Wilson the volleyball is one; the tooth-pulling scene is another; his joy over catching a fish...there are just no words to accurately convey how brilliant this film really is. My advice: see it for yourself. It's an experience you won't soon forget.
0440219078|4.0|I think there are many reasons to read this book. The story takes place in a whole new world, where everything is perfect and there are rules for everything. In the community, all choices are made by a Commitee of Elders, who decides the future of the community. I recommend reading this book to everyone, because it´s very interesting and it´s narrated from a different perception of the future, where everything is so organized and perfect that there is no liberty. A very good book.
B000001EYW|4.0|&quot;Still Waters&quot; was the first studio release in 4 years from the Brothers Gibb and it was a smash right out of the box.  Peaking at number 11 on the U.S. album chart, it was the first gold album for the brothers in over a decade.<br />Highlighted by the hit singles &quot;Alone&quot; and &quot;Still Waters (Run Deep),&quot; this stellar album also features more excellent tunes produced by such legends as David Foster and Arif Mardin.  <br />&quot;I Will&quot; is a top notch pop song.  In listening to this tune I could definately hear how the Backstreet Boys or N'Sync could have covered it and had a huge hit.  <br />&quot;With My Eyes Closed&quot; absolutely should have been a single/video.  The R&amp;B producer on this track combined Barry's lead vocals with haunting harmonies by Robin on the chorus.  This would have delivered a top 10 smash to both the Bee Gees and their record label.  Why it wasn't released as a single is beyond me.<br />You don't have to be a Bee Gees fan to enjoy this album.  Definately another pop classic from todays best songwriters!
0316666343|5.0|By turns moving, gripping, horrifying, and lyrical, &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is a lovely meditation on grief and loss... not only the grief and loss felt by those left behind, but the grief and loss of the dead. I read it straight through last night, thankful for the &quot;hype&quot; that had given me the information about the book, and have recommended it to about a dozen people already today. Well worth the investment of a reader's time and energy.
B0000041Z6|3.0|This set is not really worth buying, but if only someone would release a set combining Solti's *first* recording of every Mahler symphony, that would be a very competitive set.  I've never held with the idea that Solti was too &quot;brutal&quot; for Mahler -- first of all, he's not much more brutal than Bernstein or anyone else, and second, Mahler *is* brutal.  But you'll get a better picture of Solti as a Mahlerian if you buy his best Mahler performances individually and skip the dull digital remakes that infest this Chicago set.  The best Mahler performances Solti recorded in Chicago are: the eighth, which is available separately on an excellent single-disc rematering; the sixth, a great performance, available (from England and elsewhere) on a single disc; and the fifth, which is available on a twofer (from England and Canada and France) coupled with Solti's first Mahler recording, a fine and beautifully recorded 4th with the Concertgebouw that beats the pants off the terrible Chicago remake with Te Kanawa.  Also available from England and Canada is a twofer with Solti's fine London Symphony Orchestra performances of the first and second symphonies; not only are these better than the Chicago remakes, they have better sound too (Decca engineers never could get a really good sound out of Chicago halls, which is one of the reasons why the 8th was recorded in Vienna).  Finally, Solti's excellent 9th with the London Symphony has never even been on CD; one hopes that will be rectified someday.<br />In short, don't go for the big box.  If you want Solti in Mahler, get his best recordings individually, and skip the pointless remakes.
B000066NW0|3.0|It's ok. Not the best CD, but not a total waste of my money. But that might just be because I got it on sale...I wouldn't recommend paying the full [price] for it, it's not worth it. There are a couple of really good songs on here, such as &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;I'm With You&quot;, and &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot;. The best songs are not the ones where she's trying to sound all Alanis-angst-ridden. It's the sweet melodies where she lets her voice show. I read in an article that she used to sing a lot of country...it shows with some of her impressive vocals. However, there are some songs which are positively unbearable, whether because of bad producing or just not sounding quite right (&quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; features an odd, Limp style rap that just doesn't work). All in all, if you can get it on sale, buy it, but I enjoyed Vanessa Carlton and Michelle Branch more.
B00003CY0U|2.0|Halle Berry with Her vibe can't save this film.John Travolta is still Coasting with another Mail in type of film.this film reminds me of a few different films&never finds itself.it's just a Film that is Grandstanding it's Own Hype for the most part.watching it once was half too much.some decent Action parts is why I give it a two.
B000065LRP|5.0|If You love lyrics and melodies that stand the test of time and if you are also a lover of great singing, then this is a must have for your cd library. Barbra Striesand of course has always had THE most amazing voice no matter what decade she was recording in. This collection showcases ONLY SOME of the many reasons she is generally considered the greatest female vocalist of all time. If you are a new listener to this incredible woman's work, then you are in for a soaring experience. Tracks like He Touched Me, All In Love Is Fair, On A Clear Day, Memory, A Piece Of Sky and Some Day My Prince Will Come all from different decades will reveal to you just a few of the many incomparable vocal performances Streisand is known for. But don't stop here, the number of outstanding incredible performances left off this collection is astounding. If You have'nt heard Barbra's versions of Someone To Watch Over Me, The Shadow Of Your Smile, Make The Man Love Me, Just A Little Lovin', I've Never Been A Woman Before, I Won't Last A Day Without You, and Tommorro to name but a few ,then you may find yourself even more impressed than you will be after listening to this collection, if thats possible.. Clearly I love these recordings and no doubt you will too.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|There's a moment early on in &quot;Untitled&quot;, Cameron Crowe's 'Bootleg' Director's Cut of &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, where rock critic Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), in mid-rant, claims that the Box Tops' &quot;The Letter&quot; says more in less than two minutes, without even trying, than Jethro Tull can say in hours, while trying their damndest.  It got me thinking: why didn't Crowe take his own advice?  Why did he take a perfectly serviceable 122-minute movie that appeared to say everything, and turn it into a 162-minute movie?  Well, I've seen &quot;Untitled&quot;.  It blows up &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, makes it spectacle and spectacular, while never losing its intimate edge.<br />This is a case where more of a good thing doesn't turn into too much of a good thing.<br />What do you get with &quot;Untitled&quot;?  Well, more character.  Backstories are fleshed out, relationships are better defined, and the humanity becomes more human.  We see William's (Patrick Fugit) kleptomania, along with more examples of how his youth made him an outcast.  We get Penny Lane's (Kate Hudson) nurturing side, explicitly portrayed.  And we get a full-on glimpse of Jeff Bebe's (Jason Lee) envy, why it started and how it manifests itself.  A couple of full scenes are added, most notably a radio station appearance that's terribly funny, albeit irrelevant to the plot.  But most of the additional footage comes from existing scenes being lengthened.  More often than not, the point is clarified without boring the audience with tediousness.<br />The audio commentary begins with Cameron Crowe outlining the two paths they might go down.  The first is the hemming-and-hawing path, where all the truths are covered up, in favour of banal stories and technical information.  The second path is the heart-on-your-sleeve path, where all the inspirations and backstories are owned up to, where mistakes are agonized over, and the truth is king.  If you've ever seen a Cameron Crowe movie,or heard the man speak more than two sentences, you'll know which path he chooses.<br />Crowe dominates the track.  He's joined by a couple of execs (or PA's or something; they're never really introduced and don't say much).  But the real treat of the track is the inclusion of one Mrs. Alice Crowe, Cameron's mom (and Frances McDormand's doppelganger).  Besides being a doting mother, and quick to offer praise for her son, she also offers some real insights into the genesis of the film.  She appears to know the movie backwards and forwards, and acts as further proof of the film's accuracy.  It's amazing to see how much of the movie was really based on actual events.  Every scene appears to begin with either Cameron or Alice being taken aback by the memories it invokes.<br />This is probably one of the best commentary tracks I've heard, for the inclusion, in equal measure, of technical information, on set anecdotes, and passion.<br />Also included on Disc One is real life video footage of an interview with Lester Bangs.  Lester's vitriol is palpable, his menacing nature is enormous, but his warmth shines through.  It's an interesting tidbit, in that it offers further proof that Hoffman is one of the greatest actors working today, for he doesn't stoop to imitating Lester.  It's more like channeling.  Then, Cameron includes a list -- complete with fully-represented album covers -- of his top albums of 1973 (the year the film is set).  An interesting curiosity.  Some of the works actually inform specific scenes from the film, which is kind of a neat trick.  They've also put together a &quot;video&quot; for the Stillwater song &quot;Love Comes and Goes&quot;, which is basically a montage of behind-the-scenes moments from the Rock Camp the actors had to go through.  More of this can bee seen on &quot;B-Sides&quot;, another video montage.  Most interesting is the inclusion of seven of Crowe's Rolling Stone articles from the era, printed in their entirety.  It's not hard to see the nascent voice of Crowe the filmmaker shining through these passion-filled pieces.<br />Disc Two has a lot less going for it.  Its main feature is the original theatrical version of the movie.  Also included is the full-length (15 minutes or so) Cleveland Concert, parts of which we see in the movie.  Despite the fact that Billy Crudup sometimes plays notes not actually in the songs, and that Jason Lee still has to work on his between song banter, this footage shows just how well the actors did in achieving their collective band persona.  The music's not that great, but the vibe, captured by on-stage camera work, is authentic.  The Production Notes section is basically the same essay you'll find in the box's liner notes, only with additional information.  There's an interesting little video moment, with Pete Droge and Elaine Summers singing &quot;Small Time Blues&quot; in a Hyatt House hotel room.  It's a moment quickly passed by in the actual movie.  But here you get to hear the whole song, from William's voyeuristic point-of-view, and it's just stunningly beautiful.  You can also scroll through Crowe's screenplay, peruse the cast and crew bios, and watch the theatrical trailer.<br />Disc Three is an audio CD.  It's got the six Stillwater songs, written variously by Nancy Wilson, Cameron Crowe, and Peter Frampton, among others.  They're not very good songs, and I'm not sure they fit the era they're supposed to come from, but for an &quot;Almost Famous&quot; completist, like myself, it's neat to have them in all their (sub-)glory.<br />A lot of effort was put into making this set look like a real bootleg, the kind of clandestine little document you'd pick up at a seedy record store.  I think the look and feel enhance the movie.  Which was pretty good to begin with.
020530902X|1.0|I must disagree for one major reason. This book certainly does contain some invaluable information to help writers on their way and does act as more than just a set of grammatical rules. I think it all depends on how you use the book. If it's your Bible of Writing, then you possibly pen yourself in. If you use it as a supplemental text, it may work much better. Let's use the analogy of the 5 paragraph essay. It's definitely an easy way to start out and get people started with academic writing, but that's all it is basically: a start. You learn to organize, to state your arguments, etc., but in the end a 5 paragraph essay is not always (and not often) the best way to go. As a general set of guidelines, this book would work, but the authors present it as the only way to go to create effective writing. My writing style is outside the mainstream, so maybe this experimental leaning has a definite effect on my opinion. Just beware of your approach to this text, writers.

B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD is amazing! If you're about to buy this album, and expect the same kind of sound like on her first two album, you're gonna be highly disappointed!!! This album stands on its own! It's not a continuation of \\"Baby and \\"Oops\\". Britney has matured into a nice young girl (or woman for that matter). (...) I've noticed in each album, she does a remake of a song. In \\"Baby\\", its Cher's \\"The Beat Goes On\\". In \\"Oops\\", its The Rolling Stones' \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\". And in \\"Britney\\", its Joan Jett & The Blackhearts' \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\".<br />This CD also has an enhanced part to it. It includes a live performance of Overprotected with movie clips of her new movie Crossroads, that comes out February 2002.<br />I strongly recommend this CD to any Britney Spears fans!!!(...)

0679731725|5.0|In his first three novels Kazuo Ishiguro reveals his characters with care and subtlety through their recollections of events long past. These memories are often fragmented, sometimes hazy, sometimes simply untrustworthy. Some characters willingly explore old memories for answers, while others show less interest in introspection. All three stories effectively employ a first person narrative style.<br />&quot;It is possible that my memory of these events will have grown hazy with time, that things did not happen in quite the way they come back to me today.&quot; (A Pale View of Hills)<br />&quot;Did Miyake really say all this to me that afternoon? Perhaps I am getting his words confused with the sort of thing that Suichi will come out and say.&quot; (An Artist of the Floating World)<br />&quot;But I see I am becoming preoccupied with these memories and this is perhaps a bit foolish.&quot; (The Remains of the Day)<br />Ishiguro shifts the timeline back and forth as individual memories, often triggered by other memories, are recalled. These recollections yield incomplete answers, indications, and vague hints. Like Ishiguro's characters, we readers find ourselves becoming interpreters searching for answers in old memories.<br />In &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; Ishiguro does not give us the traditional, humorous caricature of an English butler, but a convincing and disturbing portrait of a flawed individual. Stevens held himself to high standards and principles, and continually strived to exhibit those characteristics that define a great butler. And yet, throughout his years at Darlington Hall, he used his unquestioning loyaty and commitment to Lord Darlington as a shield from personal responsibility. He abdicated personal choice, avoided questioning Lord Darlington's actions, and refrained from close personal relationships. <br />We meet Stevens late in his career. Lord Darlington is no longer alive. England and her Allies have defeated Germany. Stevens still has much pride in his years of service to a great man, but unwittingly, almost unwillingly, he begins to question whether his service and devotion were misdirected, even wrong. On occasion, Stevens even finds himself unaccountably straying from the truth whenever uncomfortale questions arise concerning Lord Darlington's German sympathy during the thirties.  At the same time unsettling memories surface regarding a house keeper, a Miss Kenton, that left Darlington Hall many years ago. We recognize, but Stevens seemingly fails to do so, that Miss Kenton was offering her love.<br />Stevens, Lord Darlington, and Miss Kenton, to a lesser degree, all made mistakes that profoundly influenced thier lives and the lives of others.  Surprisingly, Ishiguro shows little interest in why his characters made mistakes in the past.  His focus is clearly on how they come to recognize past mistakes and how they react to these uncomfortable discoveries.<br />With each rereading of his novels my admiration increases for the remarkable skill and talent of Kazuo Ishiguro. He is undoubtably one of the great writers of our time. I highly recommend this extraordinary novel. I envy those that have yet to encounter &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot; for the first time.
079284632X|4.0|I have two things to say about this film<br />1)Buy it and watch it a lot.  It is very raw and natural and the closest thing to Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the way that you feel like you are there.  I'm pretty sure the budget didn't allow for much lighting, therefore, we're creeped out and mystified by the dim, sun and moon-lit qualities the film has.  Anyway, this movie deserves all the credit it gets from true horror fans.<br />2)The person who thought this movie was so horrible actually listens to Janet Jackson and Cyndi Lauper.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Cast Away, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks, is one of the best pictures of 2000. Tom Hanks plays Chuck Nolan, a 40-year-old FedEx employee who is stranded on a desert island after a plane crash. This means that Tom Hanks basically IS 2/3 of Cast Away, acting all by himself with very little dialogue. This movie captivated me, watching how &quot;Chuck&quot; went from a workaholic average American to a Pacific islander over a period of several years psychologicaly AND phyiscally. Cast Away is a feircely imaginative movie, completly gripping and beautiful.
B00005RHGK|1.0|After seeing, analyzing, and obsessing over more than 300 horror movies at least, I can honestly say that this movie is the WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE.  It really doesn't deserve my words and I wish to make this very short.  Give me a break and get a brain.  Boring, inane, tired, trite, and long.  I hate this movie with a passion.  And I normally love the dumb, teenage horror movies-go buy Sleepaway Camp to give your brain an excercise.  This movie just makes you dumber and me angrier.
B000066AXE|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is an excellent DVD! Russell Crowe shines in this picture. May be one of his best performances ever!
B000066I6N|5.0|This is a truly wonderful cd. All of the songs are beautifully arranged and performed flawlessly. There is a certain quiet dignity in this recording that is truly refreshing to ears that are tired of the usual garbage that pollutes popular music these days.<br />This latest outting exhibits Plant's usual originality; he never makes the same cd twice which is something I cannot say for any of the other \\"oldheads\\" who still make records these days. This is not an album that was made for the sake of making a record, and it shows. (sorry Mick Jagger, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart et al, etc etc, ad nauseum....these are not second rate pop songs designed to sell) As is usual for Plant, this recording is fresh and inspired, with a great experimental edge that sounds as futuristic as it does classic.<br />The material consists mainly of covers; they are songs that meant a lot to Robert as he was growing up. He made this recording as a way to share this with everyone. Kind of a sentimental chap, that old Robert guy is.<br />The entire album has a smoky, ethereal quality to it, so you might really enjoy listening to it in mood lighting. (I would call some of the pieces \\"night songs\\") The band combines old blues riffs with exotic eastern sounds, and lush electronic arrangements. What's more, the band's playing is really impressive...this is not just a \\"back up\\" band for a famous singer. These men are all serious musicians in their own right, and they work together so well it will remind you of how truly great a band can sound when they click together.<br />In conclusion, I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music that is approachable and speaks from the heart. This is not like the other crap in the new release bin. There will be no teeny bopper talentless \\"divas\\" to be found. There is no angry, noisy attack on the eardrums. There is no fake r&b.....no gimmicks, no mass-market garbage. Just a great album by a great band. <br />From Led Zeppelin to Strange Sensation, Robert Plant has managed to be true to himself and to his music. His voice is now aged...mellowed out like a fine wine, and it sounds perfect against this backdrop. Okay, stop reading and start listening.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spiderman it´s the best comic book-movie adaptation of all time!<br />I´m really looking forward for the DVD, there are a lot of extras, and if the DVD looks the same as the trailer in the Black Hawk Down DVD...... WOW!<br />There is only one thing: What happend to the delete scenes!
B00003CXI1|3.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed all four Potter books so far, I was skeptical about a movie version. Yet I was pleasantly surprised by the movie's general faithfulness to the book. Considering the horrid limitations that constrain moviemakers trying to bring a book to the silver screen, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good adaptation.<br />Though I had some minor problems on first viewing: the abbreviation of the book's beginning, the poor portrayal of the scene in the forest, and as great as she is in her own way, Emma Watson did not fit my picture of Hermione--the movie has since grown on me in its own right.<br />On its own, this movie easily gets four stars out of me. But...(and this is a big BUT) with two discs to work with, Warner Brothers has underwhelmed me with the DVD's weak special features. Most of the cool stuff included here has been available free at the Harry Potter website.<br />In comparison with other recent multi-disc releases (Cast Away, The Godfather Collection, The Simpsons Season One) and even some single discs (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Gandhi) Harry Potter's special features come up miserably short. There is not even a director's commentary (just a woefully short featurette).<br />I give the movie my full recommendation; just don't expect much else from this DVD package.
B00005YXZH|2.0|For all the ink spilled by critics in praise of this album, it's no better than mediocre.  The album has a few mildly catchy tunes -- &quot;Poor Places&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; come to mind -- but is a pale imitation of more inventive artists like Beck and Yo La Tengo.  &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; is like the shadow cast on the cave wall by Beck's &quot;Odelay!&quot; or YLT's &quot;Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out.&quot;  Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your time.
B000067CPX|5.0|Even though i was so set on buying this record before hearing any material..and i still would've given it a 5...im not lying to you..bought it the first day and its awesome. Filled with so much diversity, by the way is kinda a mini &quot;greatest hits&quot; album soaring over many styles they have visited in the past along with introducing new tracks. By the way is they type of album that after 3 spins you wont be able to put down..so WARNING! You WILL NOT by dissatisfied with this record..its awesome from the californication-esque title track to the awesome guitar driven tempo chaning &quot;venice queen&quot; its all good.
B0000026J6|5.0|As far as I am concerned Leonard Cohen is one of the greatest poets, living today.<br />I find his work uplifting, rhythmic, soothing and enlightening. Of course I cannot pretend to know Cohen's meaning behind many of his songs, that does not matter at all. Like with all great poetry, I rely on my own interpretation.<br />This CD is particularly ingenious.<br />Let me refer to a few of the songs on this compilation. It rings a real chord with me in this postmodern age, where it is so difficult to make sense of a world that seems to have become an Orwellian nightmare gone real.<br />First We Take Manhattan: deals with a man's frustration with being unable to make a difference in an uncaring, immoral society, and a dream of conquering the world to set things right. Of course it speaks of influence through music, a love that Leonard Cohen and me share. Leonard Cohen, although not an observant Jew, is quite obviously very conscious of his Jewish heritage.

B000066BYE|4.0|In a way its very hard to rate a double cd set when it consists of, not an A and a B part, but two different concepts, such as an A and 1. Henceforth, the review of the Hullabaloo o.s.t.<br />Cd1 is a collection of bsides, most of which seem to be leftovers from \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" Muse´s masterpiece. They start off rocking with the trashy guitar, and perfect tuned bass with a couple of percussion tracks and Bellamy´s wonderful so-familiar voice. <BR>What distinguishes these tracks from their LP counterparts is the lack of production and piano arrangements that make the music excitingly different and explicitly wonderful, nonetheless the lyrics are great and the tunes seem to comfort every braincell that had been waiting in angst to receive the music.<BR>Expect a wonderful acoustic rendition of \\"hyper condriac music\\" and a lot of beautiful music.<BR>Even though most of the tracks are good, they just dont feel good enough, if \\"origin...\\" had only been a double cd, these babies would have been shocking, but they come out as good.<BR>Therefore id rate this cd with a 3 and a half.<br />For cd 2... WHOA!!! Live albums dont get better than this one, and will probably have to struggle for years to beat the amazing sound quality, feeling and perfect performances contained within... Even though there is almost no piano at all, man this guys do rock in \\"classical style\\"!!! Matthew B. is one of the best composers around, and he instantly dominates every single feeling you could have until he stops singing... This is an amazing cd 6 stars!!! 6 stars!!! <br />In addition to this item i also recommend you get the live dvd... which i also own and must say was very pleased to get...<br />All in all 4 stars go out to Muse for an amazing double album...

B00005ASOI|5.0|This is as good as horror films get.That's all.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I really love this CD! and I love Pink! I think that she is a great inspiration to young singers who think of beiong famous one day. I think she really puts all her emotion into her songs and that they represent her struggle to come to the top.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch comes up with another stunner.Hypnotic,beautiful,enigmatic,challenging and brilliant.Just brilliant.I've watched this about 10 times so far.Jaw dropping stuff.Great looking image and a rich,warm DTS track.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I would not consider myself a jazz, nor a country fan.  I like jazz well enough, but to me, it mostly all sounds the same which is to say I think it's pleasant and nice to listen to, but songs are not distinctive enough to capture my attention.  And country is just a bit twangy for my liking.  That having been said, I heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; on Windowsmedia.com and I went out and bought the album the same day.  I have not bought an album in the last 4 years before this one.  All I can tell you, prospective buyer, is that this album is such a unique amalgamation of genres and sounds.  I love that!  I love that you can say it sounds like jazz or blues or country or some other sound because there are certainly elements of all of those things.  some of the jazz-purists who have reviewed here perhaps don't agree, but for me, it's just such a wonderful, unique sound and just good music (vs. good &quot;jazz music&quot; or &quot;country music&quot;, etc etc)  Her voice is smokey and honeyed and wistful and seductive and just fantastic... :)  why 4*'s?  b/c i hold out hope her next album will be something even bigger and bolder and cooler...  (plus, check out her website and her live stuff at the House of Blues...i prefer those renditions, actually, over the album ones...)
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I have always been intrested in the whole story about Pearl Harbor. Then, to my amazement, the movie comes out on film. I ran to go buy it. This movie is fantastic, and has great special effects. Not only is this movie entertainin, it's educational also.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Okay, I didn't know this was a comic book, I hadn't ever heard of it but I was blown away!  Everyone in this movie was perfect, wonderful, you fell in love with all of them, hell I even loved the bad guys.  This cast and this story was incredible.  Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman's chemistry as Rogue and Wolverine was INCREDIBLE, I'd watch the movie just for their scenes alone but Halle Berry and Patrick Stewart who I've grown up loving, Framke, everyone in this movie.  James Marsden was fabulous, I hope that's how you spell his name, Ian, oh my God, this was SO good and I am dying for the next one.  Please see it, it's a great action flick with a lot of emotion in it, a lot of connecting and a lot of chemistry, it's got everything good, humor, it's fabulous.  See it.  BUY IT!
B00003CXDD|4.0|I'd not seen this film before, but happened to see it advertised with another I was purchasing, so I read it's \\"biography.\\"  The name of Director Ron Howard--Opie to those of us who grew up watching the Andy Griffith show--put the seal of approval on it as far as I was concerned, so even though I wasn't familiar with the work of any of the actors in it, I bought it.  I wasn't disappointed either.  The film is a charming confection of good and evil, fairies and witches (though I could have done without the slap stick brownies), dwarves and humans.  Like the current film, Lord of the Rings, the scenery through which the hero and his human defender must travel to accomplish their mission is stunning.  Like the Hobbit village the small town of the dwarves is a delightful world in miniature.<br />There is much for a child to learn--even the child in all of us--from the story, too: That those who are political leaders are not always right, that great moral courage knows no size restrictions, that doing the right thing is not always easy, that those who have done wicked things can see the light change their ways, but that some evil is unredeemable and always evil, that one can die even defending a good cause.  It teaches us to give those who are physically and culturally different a chance; they may look and behave \\"odd\\" but they are often just like us.  It teaches us too that there is magic in the world, and that the greatest magic is belief in oneself and in others.  It's not Lord of the Rings perhaps, but it's certainly a decent ancestor to it.  A nice film for all ages.
B00006AW2P|5.0|a must for the true stones fan.  this was the first album i ever purchased and i was not disappointed.  no stone material, just covers, but what covers they are.  the influence of brian jones is here and one can only wonder what might have been had he lived.  if you like the stones and want to experience the beginning of \\" the greatest rock and roll band in the world\\" you must have this one.  to the stones, \\"roll on.\\"
B000001EKX|5.0|Hotter than Hell is arguably the freest and most relaxed of the KISS albums.  Released a year before Dressed to Kill and Alive!, this CD just reeks of simple, full-tilt rock'n'roll party music.  It also includes the first near-ballad by KISS, \\"Goin' Blind\\".  But by far the best musicianship is on the songs \\"Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll\\" (think \\"Elvis meets Chuck Berry in a dark alley\\"), and Ace Frehley's long, cosmic soloing on \\"Strange Ways\\".<br />GET THIS.  NOW.
B00005OAIE|4.0|...good start! I think this run will be beter and beter.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Why are you reading the reviews?  Just buy this CD...!!!!<br />Let's see:  Track One (Fight Test) could easily be a radio hit.  The next 3 songs are terrific (esp. track 3 \\"Yoshimi pt.1\\" with the very unique intro - acoustic guitar with some electronic stuff that has to be heard to appreciate).  There are a couple of songs that I'm still getting used to (like \\"Are you a hypnotist?\\") but - all in all -this is a great record and a great follow-up to Soft Bulletin.  The Flaming Lips sound has really developed into something beautiful and beyond words!<br />Listen to \\"Do You Realize?\\" on Amazon or on the Lips' website - then buy this CD!
6305428387|5.0|Even though the late John Candy was the biggest name in the movie, I thought it was the right thing to do to put the names of the three stars first in the credits. Leon (Darise Bannock) had a small supporting role in 'Cliffhanger' that same year, but gives the performance of his career in this movie. Malik Yoba and standup comic Doug E. Doug also took center stage in a movie that could've failed if Jamaica and Jamaican youth was stereotyped or presented unaccurately...But 'Cool Runnings' casted four great young start-up actors with perfect accents to represent the true story of this inspiring Olympic saga. This movie was an instant classic when it first came out, I think the first Jamaican bobsled team is probably proud of this representation of the story...of course, there were probably a few things in the movie that were only put in for effect..and Im sure the director left out any ugly parts that may have darkened the bright feel of the story..and for all we know what's in the movie may only be 90 or 95% of what actually happened. But with such a great movie to own on DVD...Do we really even need to know? This story would suit me just fine even if the four determined Jamaicans had'nt changed the winter Olympics forever over a decade ago.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is AMAZING. The moment I heard &quot;Complicated&quot; on MTV, I HAD to buy her CD. Every single song on the album is great. Her voice is so soothing, but can be rough and angry at times. She doesn't try to be anybody else. She's orginal. Her music is refreshing and this CD would be great for anyone. My favorite is &quot;I'm With You&quot;.
0671027344|5.0|I found this book, while looking online one day. I read the reviews and it sounded wonderful... I read the entire book in two days!<BR>This book is a wonderful \\"Story\\" told by a freshman in high school, Charlie. Charlie is quite timid about entering high school, and after his best friend commits suicide soon after the first days of school, Charlie is left friendless. Charlie soon meets Sam and Patrick (who are brother and sister) and they become his best friends. This is a story of Charlies freshman year in high school, his troubles with his family and his friends. This book is truley wonderful and all of my friends are in line waiting to borrow and read it. I will be a senior next year in high school and this is a fantastic book for anyone in high school or college.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is the best movie I've ever seen. The acting is outstanding and Collin Firth is the perfect actor to play the role of Mr.Darcy. I haven't read the book yet, but I'm going to the store today to buy it because I know the book is probably even better. Jennifer Ehle and Collin Firth make the cutest couple and you will LOVE this movie, I promise. Although it's long, it is the most moving and touching movie and you'll find yourself watching it over and over again. Buy the movie now, cuz you'll love it!
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore was the first to push the envelope of realism (well as real comicbook superheroes can get anyway) and gave his characters depth that no mainstream characters have ever received.  For example, we have Rorschach, a hero gone mad after dealing with criminals for so many years that he himself uses criminal means to achieve his ends.  We have the Comedian who strikes me as a more realistic Captain America as he is ultranationalistic and very, very Republican and gung-ho about America.  There is Ozymandius, the world's smartest man (or so his p.r. people tell Americans), who has shaped his mind and body and greatly resembles Jay Gatsby from the Great Gatsby because like Jay, Ozymandius is a self-made man, but is also a dreamer who feels linked to two people in history he greatly admires because they sought to \\"unite\\" the world, Alexander the Great and Ramses II (or as he is known in Greek, Ozymandius).  There's Dr. Manhattan, the only superpowered character in Watchmen and for that reason finds himself unable to relate to humanity over time and contemplates things that only gods could comprehend.  Moore injects politics as we see flashbacks of the Comedian in World War II and Vietnam and Dr. Manhattan's origins are explored and we learn why he has an obsession with clocks.<br />The public is not forgotten either and Moore includes well thought out articles about heroes and contemporary events at the end of each issue (Watchmen was originally a 12 issue \\"maxiseries\\").  We get to see old and retired heroes reflect with a touch of sadness at the good old days when they were out saving the world.  We see criminals trying to leave their past behind and deal with everyday worries.  This graphic novel has twists and turns that will surprise you.  Alan Moore, as always, attempts to touch upon every subject and Dave Gibbons is the perfect artist to be teamed with Moore (they also did an excellent Superman story in an annual in 1980s) as the detail in the backgrounds canbe stared at for hours.  It's a vivid and complete world and one that doesn't feel dated like so many comicbook tales do over time.  This one's an immortal classic and worth owning in hardcover format.
0131103628|5.0|Best C programming book!!!<BR>This book might be a little difficult for beginers but.. for programers with experience in other languages it is an excellent book.
0345413377|5.0|Okay, first off I loved the book.  I really hated The Subtle Knife, so I almost didn't read this one, but the suspense finally had me buying and reading.<br />My argument to the people who say that this book is sacreligious is the same as my argument to anti-Harry Potter people: GET OVER IT.  I myself am a religious person and I saw no wrong in this book.  Sure, it deals with killing God, but it is a work of fiction.  FICTION.  According to my handy little dictionary, it means \\"literature in which the plot and the characters are imaginary\\", not \\"something written to make unsuspecting readers convert\\".  <br />Now, on to what I actually thought... This book was very well written and was a satisfying ending to the series.  I agree with some of the other reviewers in that the ending was a little weak, but I liked this book so much better than the one before it that I can forgive that little problem.<br />I definitely recommend this book.
B0000017CA|5.0|To the last guy... why do you type like that? I Mean Like This, Capitalizing The First Letter Of Every Word. It's Very Difficult To Read.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is the type you want to watch over and over again.  I recommend it for anyone that enjoys the Harry Potter collection or a good adventure.  My kids also love this one.
0380977788|5.0|it's neil gaiman. apparently this man can do no wrong. while Coraline isn't particularly thought-provoking (nor is it meant to be), it's twisted enough to creep you out just as well as any Stephen King book, and i've read em all, so i know. Coraline is well worth the [item price]. Buy it. Now.
B00005JLDW|4.0|I went into this movie with modest expectations, but some hope based on the good reviews I'd read - which I tended to believe more than the bad ones. The bad ones all seemed to suffer from preconceptions about what a movie with dragons in it \\"should\\" be: either a fairy tale with talking dragons, or an epic battle between dragons and humans, heavy on the special effects. Well, the special effects in this film were just fine (I don't look for those small CGI flaws that delight the film geeks), and the dragons were sufficiently impressive. The male dragon, in fact, was downright terrifying, whether enveloping a castle with his wings like a fiery vulture, or (almost more creepy) lurching through the ruins of London. But, really, this is a movie about people facing dragons and not a movie about dragons: the terror they live with, the shifts they have made to survive, and the conflicts in leadership styles. I really cared about these people, especially the Brits hunkered down in their ruined castle. And because I cared about them, the choices they made and the terror they were facing were interesting. This is still a popcorn movie, but the kind of popcorn movie they made before summer movies were all dumbed down and franchised. No one here has super-hero capabilities, and the end was all the more exciting for it. As for the whys and hows of how the dragons came to be, we see as much as we need to know for the story, and it makes as much sense as it needs to. People unduly worried about the logic of dragon reproduction probably should see another movie, as the human concerns would be lost on them. I loved the quiet if tense moments. I was grateful that the summer rhythm of explosion on explosion was by-passed in favor of telling a real story. This isn't a \\"great\\" movie, but it is very good of its increasingly rare kind: a summer movie with some real heart and intelligence.
B00003CXXP|4.0|My heading works on 2 levels.<br />Kubrick wanted to make this film for 15 years, but couldn't find the backing. He didn't give up, and Spielberg completed his dream. And the character david (an android played by Haley Joel Osmet) never gave up on his dream of being loved.<br />This is the story of Pinocchio, in every sense, yet in modern terms. Of course, having read the other reviews, you know this.<br />So many people panned this film because it wasn't ET. Well, IT'S NOT! There is no squatty alien with a glowing finger!!! This is a tale of sadness and longing. Sadness and longing from creations designed by man to love, yet abhorred and hunted because they can. The paradoxes abound in this film, which would have been an easy translation of Pinocchio, but set in the near future.<br />The effects are superb, and create a seamlessly real future. They appear effortlessly real, which draws the viewer into the reality. There are two surprises here. One is Jude Law.<br />Jude Law plays Gigilo Joe, a `mecka' programmed for female pleasure, who discovers his own humanity while helping David (Haley Joel Osmet) discover his.<br />The other is the final five minutes of the ending, which I will not give away.<br />If you have read my reviews, you know I weigh heavily on cinematogrophy and soundtrack to create a film. The filming actually allows you to watch this movie as if it were real, and the soundtrack surrounds you as softly as david's dream of becoming real. There are flaws; the length, and the fact you feel the movie ends twice. Get past them. The personal revelation in final five minutes is worth the indecision.<br />Ignore the poor reviews, and watch the interaction between Law and Osmet. Watch the android David's face. You WANT him to be able to express his pain.<br />This is what the movie is about.
B0000640VO|5.0|don't mind that it is in french subtitles. it is a cute lovestory and leaves you feeling refreshed. it is upsetting that Amelie didn't get more awards.

B00003CXQY|3.0|I like this movie do not get me wrong! I think it is very funny and is great but come on Disney! WHO ARE THOSE 2 BORING GUYS IN THE COLLECTORS EDITION? HOW BORING ARE THEY? I had to turn it off because they are a waste of time! They try to be funny when they are not at all! The mess up the whole Collectors Edition! If you try to make jokes, at least let them be funny! Not so boring and corny that you want to brake your DVD! Sorry, I just did not like them, even though they meant well! It was very boring! They should have been in just one part of the DVD not the whole thing, so I could have not turned them on! THEY WOULD STAY OFF LOL! That is why this movie gets 3 Stars because they are so boring!<br />THANX! :)
B000002OZY|5.0|I first bought the vinyl in the 70s because it had a few good tunes.  The Overture was being played a lot on the radio and I hoped the album had more.  It did, and still does.<br />I listened to the album many times and enjoyed, but the story behind wasn't understood until I saw the movie.  Then, all the songs had new depth and meaning.  I would recommend to anyone who likes this album but doesn't understand the connection of the songs to see the movie.  It is an enriching experience.
B00001QEE7|5.0|Even though I love Beauty and the Beast and it is my favorite Disney Movie of all time, however this movie is not far behind! This movie was out before Beauty and the Beast and I enjoyed it! It is one of the Disney's great classics of all time!<br />:)

0140186409|5.0|With over 300 other reviews listed here, I don't have much to add, except to echo what others have already said:  'The Grapes of Wrath' is one of the most powerful novels you will ever read, American or otherwise.  As you journey from Oklahoma to California with the Joad Family, you'll experience the same obstacles and emotions they experienced:  hunger, pain, separation of family, deplorable living and working conditions, tears, laughter, life, death.  But this book is so much more.  Whether or not you agree with his political views, no one can deny that Steinbeck was a brilliant writer.  That brilliance is evident in every page of this novel.  I don't think I will ever forget the book's final scene.  It will stay with me for a long, long time.  A great novel.
B00005JKJA|2.0|I stayed up very late watching this movie becuase I was waiting to see how it would come together at the end. I'm still waiting. It started out with intruiging plot lines then disintegrated into artistic babble.  I wasn't aware of this director's history prior to buying the DVD.  Had I been I would have passed.  If you are the type that can find deep meaning in a painting consisting of splatters and splashes then by all means buy this movie.  If you're looking for something with a comprehensible plot check elsewhere.
B000066NW0|5.0|First of all, I am not a teen and haven't been one for over a decade. As a male, and a fan of hard rock I normally don't find myself listening to a teen artist, and a female one at that. However, with infectious rhythms, guitars and soaring vocals, Avril cannot be lumped in with the other so-called teen pop queens. Did I mention she plays a guitar? In particular, her vocal arrangements far surpass her peer group. She has a fantastic range, able to inflect and roll lyrics so easily that she becomes an instrument herself. With an alternative rock slant, she is a welcome relief and will surely dethrone the likes of Britney and all other disposable mind numbing [stuff] permeating the air waves. While her age may show in the lyrics, it certainly doesn't show in the music. She's definately raised the bar in that department. I have never heard anything this good from a 17 year old. I think she'll be around a long time and I can't wait to hear what she does next. She has incredible energy and would be awesome in concert. Like I said, I normally listen to harder edged rock, like Incubus, Staind, Tantric, etc., but I know good music when I hear it. Avril's tunes are so catchy and well done that I can't resist. What's in the water up there in Canada? They sure have been churning out some talent. Anyway, Bravo Miss Lavinge!
B00003CX8J|3.0|I cant believe all the excitment everyone made over this movie. I thought that there were some parts in the movie that really kept to the comic books. However I was really disappointed when I saw this at the movies. I was expecting the original X-men and then some. I was expecting Gambit to be in this and I thought Rouge was too young. In the comic books it shows her being older. The movie was ok but it was made up of anticipation of the movie coming out. If you want good movies that have been taken from comic books buy Blade, The punisher, The phantom, etc. Just rent this movie first and then if you like it then buy it.

0451450523|5.0|Where to begin about this book?  I have read it so many times.  I've watched the movie even more.  This book is about love, hope, sadness, and regret.  Read this book if you like fantasy novels, romantic stories, or adventures.  It has all three.  The romance of Prince Lir and the Lady Amalthea is beautiful.  The way everyone who comes into real contact with the unicorn is lovely.  Schmendrick is even great, and he's the most annoying thing in the book.  The way he longs to be a true magician is heart wrenching.  Molly Grue makes you think of a woman who has seen too many years of hardship, but finally finds something that makes it all worth it.  Nothing about this book is bad.  But if you are the type who cries, be warned, the end of this book will make you cry, or at the very least tear up.  It did that to me, it does that to me everytime I read it, in fact, and I'm not much of a crier.  I hope everyone at least gets this book from the library and reads it at least once.
0061020710|5.0|I am a new fan of Terry Pratchett. He writes with much style and wit. The book The Color of Magic is hilarious. I have rarely laughed so hard as I do reading this book. His abiliy to take the most common known myths and legands and twist them into something funny is wonderful. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and look forward to the next book.
B000001FN3|5.0|One of the best &quot;theme&quot; albums ever.  I'd rank it right up there with The Wall and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway.  If you like Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother, and you enjoy that sort of Orchestral Rock that Alan has such talent for, then you'll love this album.  Enjoy.
B0000640VO|5.0|A movie that makes you feel amazing. That's all you really need to know to watch it but if you're not sold don't worry this is a beautiful movie. The cinematography is as amazing as i've ever seen it, the colors are brilliant and everything about this movie makes you feel good. Brilliant.
6304711875|4.0|Ok,Scream is a great movie but it's not scary.I don't know why it is considered a horror movie,more like a thriller.It's stupid,when cidney is speacking on the phone she said it's always a big breasted woman running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door yet when she is getting chased she runs up the stairs when she could be running out the front door.That's why I gave it four stars instead of five.The graphics are cool.I like at the beginning when Drew Barrymore is getting chased in her house when her parents find her it is so cool so cool.Now that's graphics.Wes Craven is so awsome,from Swamp Thing to Nightmare on Elm Street to scream he's awsome.Hey,did you know that in all three scream's the people die in the beginning are on the cover.Drue Berrymore in the first one Jada Pinkett and Cotton in the third,now you now.If your in the moud for a thriller see scream.I also reccomend scream two and three.
B00005RYLE|5.0|IT LOOKS REAL GROOVY WITH DTS SOUND YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK IT'S TO COOL NOT TO OWN SO BUY THIS DVD AND.....Join Us
B00005RFAI|4.0|Alright first of all let me tell you I am a great P!Nk fan.  O.K. This cd is very good, very rich , and very different from the old \\"Can't Take Me Home\\"  Sound. My favorite song is P!nk's newest song Just like a pill, What a beat.  And Respect and 18 wheeler are cool to.  P!nk has accomplished so much with this cd, it has currently sold more than 3 million copies!!! Thats somthing to be proud of! People say that the colour Pink calms you, But the singer will have you dancing , and singing along to the rockin' Loud lyrics, Hope you like it!
B00005ARDC|3.0|I saw these guys in chicago at the metro and they were not at their best.  The CD is way better than their live show.  If you are interested in raw talent and an amazing live true rock show reminiscent of Iggy, the Feelies and the like try for Vax Wallo--an obscure Chicago band.  If you can get hold of their cd's you will have found a real treasure.
B000067CPX|2.0|Before writing this review I wondered what i liked most about Red Hot Chili Peppers. And after due consideration i concluded it's the way they mixed &quot;punkrock&quot; with funk and rap. And that is exactly what's missing on this cd. The single &quot;by the way&quot; is the best song on the cd and might mislead the unknowing buyer. This is not RHCP as i liked them most. If you are into more &quot;MTV-ish&quot; like music you might like it. I hope for the real RHCP diehearts they will return to their roots.
B000066F6H|3.0|so I picked up this CD.  Shows great potential ... I love that thetheir talent is still a little rough -- BY FAR MUCH BETTER THAN ANY STROKES TUNES!
0316666343|3.0|Like the previous reviewer - I too and kind of ticked with myself of falling into the media hype about this book....IT WAS NOT THAT GOOD.<br />Good stuff - Yes it was a different perspective in hearing the victim tell the story.  Not the usual cop/detective trying to be the voice of the victim.   The victim in this story seemed very sweet and young and still trying to figure out what life was all about even though she no longer had one.<br />Bad stuff -  The story was a tad boring at times plus exploring how a family can be completly torn apart and then brought back together in the last oh say 10 pages....nope not good enough for me.  If your going to explore the family being ripped apart at least explore how they rebuild and become whole again.   My other grievance is some of the passages were just way to sappy - to many to name - so if you want to know you will have to read it yourself.<br />Was it a good book...no not really....was it interesting enough to hold my attention.  Yes.
B00005QIPH|1.0|If you want the real talent GO buy anything by the Velvet Underground or The Stooges, Can -- It is unfortunate that they have made a slight fortune off of great talents like Lou and Iggy.  I guess it pays to have daddy warbucks hand you a career on a silver platter.<br />These guys do not need your money -- they have nice big trust funds that allow them to be  &quot;starving artist&quot; poseurs.
B00004RHZU|4.0|P!nk made her debut as a rather dime a dozen man-hating R&B vixen. The only thing that really set her apart being the skin tone and the hair color. Three good, but common place singles were released - \\"There You Go\\", \\"Most Girls\\", and \\"You Make Me Sick\\" - all with the basic theme of women not needing men. The album uses plenty of urban and pop cliche, yet still manages to rise above it, do to the personality of the singer, and the better than average sings using the same old themes. The whole album is good, but obviously made to be commercial. Good quality tunes, but their isn't any soul put into them. The only song I feel any personality in is the confused \\"Split Personality\\". It's not the real P!nk on this record, and after a chart topping stint as a Lady Marmalade girl, she let her true colors show with the dynamic \\"M!ssundaztood\\". Unlike this release, you can feel her personality being reflected in the songs. Both albums are great, and kinda leave P!nk's music career with a sort of split personality. Solid debut effort.
B000066NW0|5.0|I've seen a lot of reviews that say Avril is nothing but a second Britney Spears, but unlike Britney, Avril doesn't pant in her songs.  I think Avril's album has a lot of different styles, ranging from punk to alternative.  She has a really pretty voice and good messages in her songs, and I think this cd is worth buying to anyone who's looking for cool guitar riffs and catchy lyrics.
B0000640VN|3.0|First of all, I enjoyed this movie, although its not the genre<BR>I favor, but the teaser just blew me away, Ryan doing what shes<BR>good at against Hugh Jackmans aristocratic gentleman, now he is good in any genre isnt he ?<BR>Funniest part is, Liev went back in time, back<BR>to the future again, now with his great great grandfather who falls in love with Lievs ex-girlfriend and she for him, great<BR>great grandfather goes back, in time, Lievs ex-girlfriend goes<BR>after him and becomes Lievs great great grandmother.
B00000I07Q|4.0|This album shows the signs of the band slowing down from their biggest album &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; but still did very well.  This album sold 7 million copies and featured many top ten hits but the highlight of this album is &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;.  This is their fourth studio album.  This is a good album but tends to be very cautious on their music just to have another hit album. I congradulate them because there are very few artists who make it past certain stages in music and they did it.
6305728437|4.0|i'm a hudge Mulan fan, my friends even call me Mulan because they say i act just like her, some will go as far as to calling me Ping, but that's another story! i love this movie because it proves you can do anything if u believe in yourself and put your mind to it. i love the songs reflection and i'll make a man out of you. my favorite characters are Mulan (of course)and Mushu. this is a great movie for people of all ages...i'm counting down the days until Mulan 2 comes out in 2003 :) <BR>from a true Mulan fan always and forever<BR>Babblin Boo aka Mulan to my friends..hehe.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I love this movie.  When i first saw Beauty and The Beast back in 1991 I fell in love with it as did many others.  This is one of my favorite Disney movies.  I also loved the Lion king and Aladdin.  Another great feature to this movie was it's soundtrack, when I first saw this movie I couldn't help but to sing all the songs to it.  I am also excited that it is coming to DVD.  I have been waiting 11 years for this.
0736041850|5.0|This book is an excellent weight training reference for insight into the anatomy of the major muscle groups, and the exercises best suited to train specific muscles.<br />The book is broken down into seven major muscle groups: arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, buttocks, and abdomen. Within each muscle group are multiple exercises, each comprised of detailed anotomical illustrations, instructions on performing the exercises, and key information such as variations (for specific focus on particular muscles) and warnings (to aviod injury).<br />Using this book, one could easily select a variety of exercises to build a total body workout program. The selection of exercises also allows for some routine variation to keep one's workout from getting stale.<br />The illustrations are of an exellent quality, as are the materials. The pages are of heavyweight paper, with a semi-glossy finish.<br />Although I rated this title highly, I did so with the understanding that it suits a very specific purpose, and is not a general purpose introduction or guide to weight training. This is an ANATOMY REFERENCE, specific to selected weight training exercises. It does not contain any other information concerning weight training, diet, exercise, etc. In fact, there is not even a brief introduction by the author, simply the reference material itself. But, in terms of its intended purpose, it is an excellent reference. If you already have some sort of &quot;Bodybuilding Encyclopedia&quot;, you probably already posess much of the information contained in this title. Having no interest in the history, self-promotion, and general testosterone driven attitudes of many of those types of titles (as well as the phonebook sized package), I much prefer this concise book as an exercise reference.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is a timeless movie starring Bill Murray and Andy McDowell.  This movie is about a weatherman who stays in Pauxytaunyville, PA for Groundhog Day to cover phil the Groundhog.  Unfortunatly, he keeps reliving the same day over and over again.  Until he finally gets things right.  If you watch the movie closely you will notice that it says Woodstock Jewelers when meeting t hat insurance guy.  This is a great movie and a great DVD.  So Enjoy!
B000002L9Y|5.0|This album is a must for any Fleetwood Mac fan.I own two cassettes,and the cd. You`ll never tire of listening to this one!!
B00003CXXJ|3.0|This movie was okay but I was not impressed by it at all.  Although I never saw it in theatres which I probably should to understand the movie more.  It made fun of Disney which was okay but the Ogre's voiced by Mike Myers was annoying and it didn't go.  It didn't end the typical happy ending but I could have cared less about the characters by that time.  It was short but it seemed really long.  The DVD was good it is a two disc set.  The movie is average nothing better.
B000067CPX|5.0|Yes, Yes YES! It's hard to believe that 20 years in this band is at the top of it's game, but there it is. It's just another fantastic album by the band that you must love if you're from LA. RHCP started as just one of a number of acts mixing punk and alternative with funk, but they have transcended their roots without leaving anything behind. The amazing thing is they just get better and better. This album is fully as good as the best in their catalogue, and the Pepper's make the best music you'll hear on the radio. Doubtless this album will sell and sell and sell, and it deserves to. If you haven't done so, buy it and then see them in concert, they are without a doubt the best rock giant playing, making staid bands like STP and U2 sound like the dinosaurs they are. There ain't no one like them, though they share a certain sensibility with hard driving eighties acts like Oingo Boingo and Adam Ant as well as moody artsy artists like Bicycle Thief and Tom Waits. What more do you want?
B00005O5CM|4.0|This is a good movie starring Reese Witherspoon.  It is funny but not believable because no one could ever go to Harvard just over a video and the part when she becomes smart is stupid in a sense that no one could ever learn the stuff she learned so fast. Released in 2001 did fairly well at the box office and is enjoyable but please do not take this movie seriously.  The DVD includes deleted scenes and is fun to have it is a two disc set.  Enjoyable and recommended but remember it is not believable.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Why bother to see this movie, when there are so many good Disney pictures around?? This movie goes on the same category as Shrek, Monsters Inc, and Final Fantasy, and is much worse than all those... want to see a big, computer animated movie? go see Shrek... this has nothing to do with Star Wars as we knew it.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|This movie is worth the watch but not a good storyline at all because she could have destroyed that part of the triangle and it would have ended it right there but no they had to keep it going anyways it had okay special effects it looks worse on TV than it did in the movie theatres.  The DVD is okay but nothing spectacular.  this movie is worth a watch but i can't watch this movie after one time, it annoys me.
B00005JKNB|4.0|Amnesia and a startling physical resemblance to a local hero (MIA in WWII) give L.A. screenwriter (Jim Carrey) a new life--temporarily.  Carrey does a splendid job--no surprise, since comedy requires more skill than &quot;drama&quot; to begin with.  Good acting all around, and a charming view of post-WWII, small-town life in California.   The main problem with this movie is the writer's implication that communism wasn't so bad:  The real villain was the U.S. Government.  This notion needs correction:  Communism is bad.  It was outlawed as a party in the U.S. of America because, like today's Al Qaida, it vowed to destroy the United States (and our free, constitutional government)and take over the world.  And like Al Quaida, it promises a hoax-utopia in which only tyrants flourish, and dissidents are murdered by the millions.  Except for this glaring abuse of history, it's a charming film.
6305696071|4.0|This movie is the start of Julia Roberts great career.  She was in movies before such as Mystic Pizza.  This is a great movie because it is great watching movies back at the dawn of the 1990s and how 1980s it looked.  This movie released in 1990 made over a 100 million dollars.  It had a good story and Richard Gere and Julia Roberts did a fine job at acting.
B000001EUL|5.0|The Scorps are absolutely the best band. Every Track On This album is great along with ANIMAL MAGNETISM,BLACKOUT& LOVE AT FIRST STING. All of these albums have a positive tone to them with a hard hitting sound. No Satanic or Evil lyrics just pure rock & roll.
B00000F566|4.0|This is one of the movies from the Late '70 to late '80s that had phenomenal soundtracks with the movies.  This movie made in 1987 had two big actors of the time Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze.  It grossed 62 million dollars.  It is supposed to look'60s but it looks more '80s and they never had the song &quot;I've Had the Time Of My Life&quot; back in the '60s.  This is a good movie but for entertainment only not for serious thought.  The DVD is good including music videos.
0972169504|5.0|You may not have seen this in your local newspapers, but rest assured, for anyone who has ever experienced a graduate education, this will be the funniest comic strip you will ever find. The Dilbert of Doctorate life, but funnier.
B000002JB8|4.0|Oceanic has a lot in common with Voices, another Vangelis album that was released one year earlier.  Though Vangelis has never explicity stated as much, I believe these two albums are extensions of one another, and might be thought of as the two halves of a single large recording project.  Listen to them back to back and it's fairly easy to find the familiar themes, especially water.  In regards to the entire spectrum of Vangelis's work, which spans three decades, Oceanic is a welcome return to his cinematic style.  Not as plodding or gothic as later works like Mythodea or El Greco, this disc is right up there with some of Vangelis's most pleasant and deliciously layered work from the 1980's.  The sea/water motif runs strong through the entire album, and Vangelis frequently captures sonic images of waves or underwater scenery with his flowing, sometimes haunting composition.  A must have for any serious Vangelis collector! ...
0972169504|5.0|If you're in grad school, you WILL love this book.  This strip really captures the weird geeky culture of grad school will knock you off your socks laughing.  Great artwork, cute characters; the works.
B000002C1W|4.0|This is a reunion album from 1987. <br />Some people complain that this album doesn't sound like a Pink Floyd album, but that is a ridiculous statement.  What does a Pink Floyd album sound like?  Part of the greatness of Pink Floyd was that none of the albuums sounded the same, especially as the group evolved. Wish You Were Here is completely different than Animals.<br />Some people complain that this sounds more like a David Gilmore solo album.  Probably the biggest problem is that this album sounds too much like a Pink Floyd album.  The songs borrow extensively from other Pink Floyd albums.  It starts out with spacey music, right out of Wish You Were Here.  One Slip could have come from The Wall.<br />Despite not having a fresh sound, it is still a pretty good album.  There are some very good songs on it.  It is slow in a few parts, but the album is 51 minutes long and you get 40 minutes of pretty good music.<br />If the album came out before Dark Side of the Moon, few people would be complaining about it.  But following in the footsteps of 4 of the best ablums in rock history (Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and the Wall), it has a lot to live up to.<br />The best Pink Floyd album to come out after The Wall is Roger Water's Amused to Death.  <br />Pink Floyd started to fall apart around Animals, when Roger Waters was taking over the group, and Richard Wright left after the 1980 Wall tour.  The Final Cut, released in 1983 was more of a Waters solo album than a Pink Floyd album.  The group broke apart after the Final Cut.  David Gilmore tried to continue on as Pink Floyd, but Waters threatened to sue.  Gilmore, Nick Mason and Bob Ezrin (who produced the Wall) got together and made this album.  They neglected to tell Wright, so he joined in late in the production and isn't listed as part of the group.<br />In 1987 both Pink Floyd and Roger Waters went on concert tours.  Pink Floyd sold out stadiums and Roger Waters couldn't fill arenas.  But, overall, Roger Waters played more Pink Floyd songs and played them better.<br />In 1994, Pink Floyd (again without Waters) released the Divisional Bell, which is very similar to this album in sound and structure.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I love Anthony Hopkins in this movie, so that's why it got 2 stars.  I love the way that man talks.  And Juliane Moore is a really good actress.  But eating a brain?  Come on.  That's the only reason I went to go see it, sadly.  I mean, who didn't go just to see that particular scene?  It was a movie made for gore and to bore me to death.  The brain thing really wasn't even that gross.  Why Anthony Hopkins?!  WHY?!
B000063S6Z|5.0|&quot;18&quot; was the first and only Moby album I own and I must say that I was plesantly suprised.  The energy and feelings that songs like &quot;In My Heart&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; make &quot;18&quot; worth it's weight in gold.  Few songs on &quot;18&quot; are actually sung by Moby, but all are written and performed by the artist.  Many people say &quot;18&quot; is the same as &quot;Play&quot; and I don't mind at all, seeing as I've never listened to &quot;Play.&quot;  Tracks that are above and beyond include, &quot;In My Heart,&quot; &quot;Signs of Love,&quot; &quot;Sunday,&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ways.&quot;  If you're not fond of &quot;We are All Made of Stars,&quot; as I wasn't, don't be worried because none of the songs are similar.  Give Moby a chance and you'll be glad that you did!
B0000640VO|5.0|How hard it was watching this film come to an end.  I wanted to stay there--in that place the film created and drew me into.  I wanted more of everything!  More music!  More gorgeous images of Paris!  More workdays at the Two Windmills!  More conversations with the Glass Man!  More of Amelie's life!!<br />If you think about it, we're all like that blind man she takes on a whirlwind tour of a Paris street, rapidly describing the world around her.<br />I can't imagine *not* owning this DVD.
0440211727|4.0|I first read this novel when Grisham just started to become big- 1993.  I read this one fist and am glad that I did as it is truly unique from his other thrillers.  I recently reread and found it slightly lacking, but still a great read.<br />You can tell that Grisham's writting isn't as polished, the story is a little slower.  However, it is a great story.  IT si truly a courtroom drama.  With insights in a grand jury, expert testimony, and closing arguments.  Very much like To Kill a Mockingbird, to which I always felt Grisham aspired.  I always thought that the protagonist, Jake Brigance, was one of the finest that Grisham wrote, but now realize that he is flawed.  He risked his family's life for fame, not justice.<br />All in all, this is worht reading (and rereading!)  I still love Grisham and always look forward to his new novels!
B000066NW0|4.0|My son and daughter have friends over all the time and all I seem to hear is Britney, Christina, etc... and they just drive my crazy.  Those voices...(Lurch here) &quot;uuhhhh uhhhh&quot;  Now I must admit I do like some of the songs on my son's Creed albums, but my own tasts are usually limited to country.  So you ask yourself, how the heck did I get hooked up on this album?  My son was watching MTV when I walked by and saw the &quot;Complicated&quot; video.  There was just something about her voice that drew me in, I had to buy the album.  It was a more raw and edgy than all the other POP stuff out there.  I've only heard a few punk songs in my life, so I wouldn't call this Punk based on that, but there's just something about this girl that I like.  The only song I don't like is &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot;.  Too much like Britney, so dock one star, but ever other song on this album I really like.

B0000640SA|5.0|This movie is very intriguing and thought provoking. All the people to whom i recommended this movie enjoyed it immensely. I still to this day do not know exactly what took place and that really irritates me, but i guess the movie is not supposed to be understood or something. I still enjoyed it enough to buy and watch on a regular basis. Great movie
B00005JLEX|5.0|I have seen almost all of Seinfeld episodes and they were the most hilarious moments I ever had ( along with Monty Python's Flying Circus).<BR>The situations depicted in the series are universal, it's about human nature,and it is a lesson for all of us, to laugh of ourselves.<BR>I urge the studios to put subtitles in all languages, including portuguese, so the vast majority of fans can buy this Masterpiece of humour.<BR>Bem hajam!!

B000002NZO|5.0|Genesis debuted in 1969 with &quot;From Genesis To Revelation,&quot; and although it's a good album overall, it's tarnished somewhat by producer Jonathan King, who smothered most of the band's songs with horns &amp; string arrangements, making them sound more like an orchestral outfit than a rock band. But with new producer John Anthony onboard, Genesis totally shifted into high gear with their second album, 1970's &quot;Trespass,&quot; and delivered their first real masterpiece---they truly became a band with this one. &quot;Trespass&quot; has been somewhat overlooked by record buyers over the years, as it doesn't feature Phil Collins on drums or Steve Hackett on lead guitar, but fear not: guitarist Anthony Phillips, in his second &amp; final album with the band, is an amazing player himself (and for further proof of this, check out his wonderful catalog of solo albums), and John Mayhew, in his only album with the group, is no Phil Collins, but his drumming here is certainly good (if it wasn't, I don't think the band would've hired him in the first place), and he gets the job done. The classic Genesis line-up with Collins &amp; Hackett were still one album away, but the &quot;Trespass&quot; line-up of the band still deliver the goods in tremendous fashion. &quot;Looking For Someone&quot; is the incredible opener, starting with Peter Gabriel's unique voice breaking through the silence, with the rest of the band later joining in to create a rock piece filled with wonderful drama &amp; atmosphere. &quot;White Mountain&quot; is appropriately titled, starting with Tony Banks' lone mellotron giving one the feeling of being in the snow-covered mountains somewhere. Then the beautiful acoustic guitars of Phillips &amp; Mike Rutherford kick in, Gabriel starts to sing, and the band take us off on another great musical adventure. &quot;Visions Of Angels&quot; has a more ballady feel to it, but it's still a very strong, majestic tune. &quot;Stagnation&quot; is a Genesis classic, a shimmering beauty played with great virtuosity, featuring a very exuberant instrumental bridge, and passionate vocals by Gabriel. &quot;Dusk,&quot; the quietest tune on the album, is a very lovely number, featuring a first-rate flute solo from Gabriel in the bridge. And finally, Genesis throw down the gauntlet with the ferocious &quot;The Knife,&quot; a monster 9-minute piece about the heat of battle, with the band working like a five-headed behemoth to bring this powerful track to life. It's a fabulous, memorable rocker, the first Genesis signature tune.The classic album cover, featuring a renaissance painting with a big knife slashing across the painting, is a perfect reflection of both the album's beauty and power. &quot;Trespass&quot; was Genesis' first true musical statement, and a firm sign of things to come from this incredible band. :-)
6305127646|4.0|This a great action flick starring a well cast Val Kilmer and a very well cast Elizabeth Shue! A lot of this recalls a good James Bond movie. Val Kilmer playes Simon Templar, a spy who has several different identities. His newest mission is to get the recipe for &quot;Cold Fusion&quot;, energy, precisely. Along the way he meets<BR>the gorgeous Elizabeth Shue, a scientist who has invented the recipe. I'll say no more so as not to give away important plot points but I end by saying that this is a very well done action flick that recalls parts of the recently released, and better, The Bourne Identity. Nevertheless, I recommend this.
B000066I6N|5.0|I am completely awestruck by this CD.  While every song is a remake from older 60's tunes the only one I knew was Hey Joe and the version on this CD is completely different from any other version (Hendrix, etc.).  Robert Plant has assembled a talented group of musicians from such groups as Portishead and The Cure that the combination has fused to create an inspiring CD.  This is what music is all about.  Funny in My Mind (I believe I'm fixin' to die) kicks off the CD with some punch.  But I think it is the softer songs like Morning Dew and Song to the Siren that really draw me into the album.  What they have done with these songs is not only breath new life into them but redefine them.  This is definitely one of the best contributions to music I have ever heard.  Someone called it a Cosmic Jukebox and I think the term fits well.  This is one of those few albums where I love every single song.

B000068PQ0|5.0|And you thought \\"Soft Bulletin\\" was great - then take a listen! New sounds (very \\"upbeat\\" beats) but the same Flaming Lips. And most importantly, find out if Yoshimi wins the battle against the Pink Robots (you'll have to wait and listen to Part 2). It's a great album to finish off the summer months (listen to It's Summertime)...heck, it'll last through autumn and beyond until they tour. \\"Steve\\" from 90210 wouldn't understand this album...too alternative for him - silly Steve, go back to the \\"Peach Pit\\" you fool.

Yes, I Missed Again, ..Hand in Hand, emm! has the feel it  took, to help me go on! Later, had a daughter, who at 13, thought In The Air Tonight, was the most awesome song. Feel my pain, Phil, she was killed on 6/1/02 at 1:55 am in a car wreck. shivering..<BR>All, listen and feel , If Leaving Me Is Easy.<BR>Never has any artist, put their soul into their music, quite like this.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I thought it was wonderfully done in the sense that it really puts you in Nash's shoes...I don't want tyo give the movie away so you will have to see what I meanfor yourself. It really blew my mind and made me second guess myself!!<BR>The extras were an added bonus to an already worthwhile buy. we get to meet Nash and hear his theory firsthand as well as all the usual, such as deleted scenes and director's commentary. <BR>All in all I would highly recommend this DVD for any collection.
038533558X|5.0|See storyline above.<br />This is the book I took on vacation--knowing I wouldn't have time to read much, I just took one--and I was very thrilled. this is my first Coben novel and I must say that I intend to put some of his past novels on my reading list. A twisting, turning, didn't see that coming, type of novel that will surprise and entertain most thriller readers. Well written with a lot of depth. It also goes to show that a protagonist, both cowardly and weak, can somehow end up on top.<br />Highly recommended.
0694003611|1.0|Everyone told us we had to get this book and someone even bought it for us at our shower.  Neither my husband nor I can figure out why this is such a classic.  It is inane.  Ridiculous.  No cute story, no message, not even a good rhyme.  Millions of people have been hoodwinked in to buying this book.  Please, save your money.
B000069KE0|5.0|Along with Chicago Transit Authority, Chicago (the &quot;official&quot; name of this CD is Chicago, not Chicago II,) represents early Chicago at its very best, seven very good musicians playing a jazzy mix of horn-influenced rock and roll. In later years Chicago became known for producing popular &quot;power ballads,&quot; but early Chicago, with Terry Kath's driving guitar, was very much a rock and roll band. On this CD, Chicago flexes its musical muscle in such suites as &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon,&quot; which feature the hits &quot;Make Me Smile,&quot; and &quot;Colour My World,&quot; as well as &quot;25 or 6 to 4.&quot; Another suite &quot;It Better End Soon,&quot; is a protest movement and ends with the simple, but very effective &quot;Where Do We Go From Here.&quot; &quot;In the Country,&quot; features the great Terry Kath, one of rock and roll's most under-rated guitarist of all time. Every song is good, and the CD as a whole represents some remarkable work by a very talented group.<BR>Rhino is in the process of remastering Chicago's catalogue, and on this issue, they have included two bonus tracks, the single versions of &quot;Make Me Smile,&quot; and &quot;25 or 6 to 4.&quot; They also did a very nice job with the packaging, adding a 16-page booklet with commentary by the band and some rare photos. Highly recommended.
0393317552|5.0|This is an excelent book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes history or wants to know why the world is the way it is today. This book attempts to answer the question, Why are some cultures so technologically advanced while others are still living as hunter-gatherers. Or, as he puts it, why Europeans &quot;discovered&quot; America and not the other way around. I often asked myself this question and now I know.<br />This book ties together so many different fields of study, it's just incredible. It must have taken years of study to compile this much info. Knowledge from each field is used to support ideas from another to build up a very strong theory of why some parts of the world are so far advanced (technologically) than others, even though hunter-gatherers are as smart (or smarter) than anyone else.
0783226160|5.0|'Animal House' is by far the best movie to come out of the world of National Lampoon. This movie is hilarious in all its raunchy humor. By far, the best American comedy ever made!<BR>Faber College 1962: a time when you were either for the system or against it. For the fraternity brothers of Delta Tau Chi, rebellion was a way of life. Throwing crazy pledge parties, wild toga parties, and just doing the things that nobody else dared to do. They lived by their rules and their rules only.<BR>I absolutely love this film. I'm a huge fan of the late great John Belushi so the first time I saw it, I knew right then that it'd be very enjoyable. Even though he doesn't have very many scenes, I'm sure others will agree that he steals the show and delivers the performance that has immortalized him. <BR>The rest of the cast that includes Tim Matheson, Bruce McGill, Peter Reigert,Donald Sutherland, Thomas Hulce and Stephen Furst,just to name a few,bring to life the wacky characters America will never forget! <BR>I highly recommend this movie! Let the party begin..&quot;TOGA! TOGA!&quot;
6303430570|5.0|Dante Hicks' oft-repeated lament sets the tone for probably the worst day in his life, something that we the viewer are privy to.<br />And who would ever have thought of filming in two convenience stores and making interactions with customers funny, not to mention the ordeals Dante has to go through to make it to closing?  The events themselves are creative juices of Kevin Smith.<br />A close second place is the dialogue, which is snappy, refreshing, profane, and laugh-until-your-lungs-ache funny.  In fact there are times when I read the screenplay just to get laughs and simply marvel at Kevin Smith's genius.  And nearly every line illuminated that light inside me.  Randal has the lion's share of them.  His conversation to the distribution center when placing an order is classic, especially as a young mother has asked for Happy Scrappy Hero Pup for her little one.  After he goes down his list, he asks the now bewildered mother, \\"What was that title again?\\"  And his conversation with Dante about how much j-zz moppers make ending with his flashing a nude magazine to a customer is another gem.  The Star Wars conversation involving his difference between the two Death Stars in Star Wars and Jedi are actually philosophically sound while being entertaining.  His statement that people dictate their own behavior is pure, refreshing Enlightenment philosophy.<br />Examples of exceptional Randal lines:  \\"This job would be great if it wasn't for the f-----g customers.\\"  \\"I could do without the customers in the video store.\\"  Dante asks, \\"Which ones?\\"  Randal replies, \\"All of them.\\"<br />I can relate to those two pieces of dialogue.  At my workplace, I'm an introvert, not comfortable in talking to people or selling them something they don't need, but having no problem when fellow employees consult my expertise on a piece of product.  Also, I'm a Jedi Master when it comes to tasks and shipment.  Needless to say, my rhythm is comes to a jarring halt when some customer asks me for help.  The way I see it, if they need help, let them initiate contact first--the scars from rude customers are many and deep, and I don't want to reopen any of them, so I punish them by ignoring them, unless they want my help.  A variation of Dante's \\"I don't bother them and they don't bother me.\\"<br />And third place goes to the choice of characters, convincing and never miscast.  Fourth goes to Silent Bob's pearl of wisdom to Dante.<br />Veronica, Dante's patient and caring girlfriend, has the right idea--education.  \\"You have so much potential that's goint to waste in this place.\\"  You go, girl!  She's a better alternative to Caitlin, the ex-girlfriend who cheated on the same number of times as Fellini's best and best-known movie.  (Cinephiles will know what I'm talking about).<br />The cat has a good scene when he does his business in front of a clearly befuddled customer.  Dante then sniffs the air, after which an offscreen meow is heard.  And it's the cat who perks up after Dante interrogates Veronica \\"how many...\\" mirroring the anticipation we feel in wanting to know the answer.<br />Pairs seem to come into play as a motif-e.g. Dante and Randal, Dante and Veronica, Dante and Caitlin, Dante and customer, Randal and customer, and of course, Jay and Silent Bob.  And as for triangles, one is enough!<br />There's one continuity error that I'm sure most fans have already spotted, but is worth mentioning.  It's the timing factor involving the little girl who bought the cigarettes, the hockey game, the old guy dying in the store.  Dante claims that the hockey game ended at 3:30 and that they returned from the funeral at 4:00.  However, that is the time the city employee claimed the girl bought the cigarettes, which was actually earlier in the movie.  Also, it's dark by the time Dante and Randal return from the funeral, so it must have been six or seven at the latest.  To really confuse things, the coroner claims the old man died at 3:20, ten minutes before the game ended.  Well, the old man came in AFTER the game ended.<br />But does this deflect enjoyment from the movie?  No way, it serves as an interesting forum of discussion among cinephiles.  And the black and white reflecting the bleak lackluster life at a convenience store and Dante's miserable life is sheer genius.  Filming it in colour is cinematic blasphemy.ed.

0743455967|5.0|&quot;&quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft&quot; is a ubiquitously important book for writers to read.<br />&quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft&quot; by Stephen King is one of those odd books I never thought I'd like. I'm not into modern horror or pop fiction. king is both. That said, I found his little memoir to be illuminatingly encouraging.<br />I'm not sure what nonwriters will think of it. But we who collect rejection notices from our favorite publishers as if it were a hobby will connect with King's look back at leaner years.<br />Now, as he can sell a book merely be the merit of his name, he might've forgotten how hard it was in the beginning.<br />King recounts anecdote after anecdote of his efforts to get various horror magazines to buy his stuff. And when they did, he was elated. Why shouldn't he? He got paid to create something from nothing. Getting paid for writing is like printing money and getting away with it.<br />For the writer, who, like I, esteems to have a shelf filled with books with our name printed on the spine, read &quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.&quot; Through this book, King brings to life not some creature from the deep beyond, but the reminder that great writing, no matter the genre (and I must admit, King raises the bar of his genre), perseverence is the trick. A lot of sweat and twice the talent. Horatio Alger would dig King's memoir.<br />I fully recommend &quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft&quot; by Stephen King. So many good writers give up the dream despite great skill in their given genre. King pressed on. So should you.<br />Anthony Trendl
B00005JKJA|5.0|Everything in this movie is superb, one of the greatest movies ever made and I have barely even begun to plum its depths.  Sad comment on what Hollywood can do to the American dream.  <br />Every scene is well filmed, but watch for one moment in particular, the moment we fully realize that the director and Camilla are in love.  This scene, with the quiet jazz notes perfectly underscoring the hurt and betrayal felt by Diana, who at this very moment is thrown towards her sad destiny(making it the key dramatic moment in the script), is one of the most beautifull moments ever captured on film, period.  Note the closeup of Diana's face next to the points of light that become shapes.  This scene announces the true arrival of Naomi Watts and the films real plot.  It is not only David Lynch's finest moment, but one the finest moments ever acted, scored, or filmed.
B00003CX8N|1.0|FULL-SCREEN?!? I'm with you, Francis Young. SELECTIONS, fah! Will someone -- ANYONE! -- from Columbia/TriStar please take a moment to actually watch this lovely, DELIGHTFUL film (worth ***** on its own) and then send us an UNABRIDGED copy to enjoy with our rahs-burries? My limp singles await the reawaking of your good sense.
B000067CQK|3.0|There is absolutely nothing new on this CD, and seeing as that the digital remastered reissue came out only a couple years back, I essentially bought the same CD twice.  The packaging is very nice, and the bonus tracks have been on the Rykodisc CDs since the Eighties.  The version of &quot;Holy Holy&quot; is not the original single version (which evidently has fallen off the face of the earth), and the remaining &quot;Arnold Corns&quot; tracks have eluded official release.  It seems that either the vaults have closed, or no one is really trying anymore.  I'll stick to the bootlegs.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I can not listen to this album in the light of day. I must listen to it all alone, in my room. The only other possible way to truely experience it is to be with your soulmate. Pet Sounds is incredibly personal and beautiful. It can convey many emotions. When I listen to it, I can draw out the sadness, the hope, and the joy. One critic said it was an album full of sad songs, and even the happy songs were sad. In many ways that is true. But in the middle of that depression, is the hope that things will be good. Woudn't it Be Nice is the perfect expression of that. You wish you could have things like they are in your dreams, but you have to wait. To talk about them makes it worse to live without them, but you must talk about them.<BR>I could go on for hours and 1000 words is not enough to explain how wonderful this album is. If you have a soul, you must own this album.
B00003CX8V|5.0|I finally got to see The Apartment about three years ago. I immediately put it on my list of 50 favorite films. The DVD version was about to come out, and I ordered it as soon as I knew it would be forthcoming.<br />I see a redemption theme here. Both Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are on their way to getting out of their unproductive situations. (If you want to know what finally happens, see it for yourself.) The film has some parallels with Pretty Woman.
B00005JKJA|1.0|the only reason to watch this movie is the lesbo action with Laura Harring, she is by far the most beautiful woman I've ever seen and carried the movie for me. Oh, everyone else is pretty good, and the shots are eerie and cool, but the movie itself is just HORRIBLE!! The whole thing is apparently a fantasy of this girl who may or may not have actually had someone killed and gone insane. By the end, you won't know what the hell happened (no one else will either) and you'll feel something greasy on your sphincter. Not only is it boring, but David Lynch's attention to little details throughout is irritating (to say the least). Imagine wasting your valuable &quot;entertainment time&quot; watching a blank television and there ya go..Mulholland Dr.
B000066NW0|3.0|I bought this CD having heard a few of the songs and found myself enjoying those songs. After listening to the entire CD I found a couple of songs that I hadn't already heard to be good. But, the rest were merely ok, if that.
0792839234|5.0|The one that started it all, if you love horror,action,and mystery this ones for you. It starts with a sex scene  in a cemetary(im only 13 by the way lol) and a funeral right after that thats where we meet our heros Jody, Reggie,and young Mike Jody(the mikes big bro) dosen't want Mike at funeral,but Mike dosen't listen and spies  on the funeral where he sees strange happenings,and a very tall man who lifts a coffin all by him or itself and takes out of the grave loads back into the hearse and takes for his own evil purposes Mike,Reg,and Jody go to check it out and encounter dwarves which are re-animated corpses downsized and Mike sees this flying silver sphere that has some deadly devices. This is fun to watch and has spawned 3 sequals that are written and directed by Don Coscarelli. It is quite enjoyable and for you car lovers it has a hemicuda in the movie.
B00005JLDW|4.0|If I had to pic one word to describe this movie: adrenaline.  The movie is a typical post-apocalyptic, fight-for-survival film, with the obvious moviegoer draw being the dragons.  As far as the plot is concerned, it is riddled with inconsistencies and bites off more than it can chew as it tries to explain in technical terms how the beasts multiplied so quickly.  When all is said and done, what you have is an entertaining story, characters who are sterotyped incredibly, and a virtual feast for your eyes and ears.<br />If you're looking for a true, believable fantasy/sci-fi movie, I wouldn't recommend seeing this.  However, if you can get by the watered-down plotline, the film is full of cliche characters who do not fail to entertain and a landscape that draws you in whether you like it or not.  When you walk out of this movie, you'll be on the edge of your seat for days.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I don't get Diana Krall.  Yes, her taste in music is excellent, and the accompaniments to her singing are usually good (as they are on this album).  But she is such a lousy singer, with a voice that is almost always flat and stilted.  She always sounds like she just rolled out of bed at 7:00 in the morning and dragged herself in front of a small jazz group or a big orchestra.  All of these songs have been done a million times by real singers, so what's the point of listening to her?
B00005U122|5.0|Could be the best music DVD available. The video is unparalleled and the sound is up there with the best DTS disks I have listened to (i.e. Hell Freezes Over).  The song selection is great.  The performance of &quot;Dogs&quot; is nothing short of astounding.
B000002H6C|5.0|An epic of an album, ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL marks Metallica's most musically mature album to date.  With subjects ranging from insanity to political corruption, Metallica not only take a step forward musically but lyrically, and coming off of the death of former bass player Cliff Burton, this album shows that they weren't about to contain their anger.  The furious riffs crash into each other at an amazing pace and solos sear through the music at speeds practically unmatchable.  There are, of course, exceptions, like the epic \\"One.\\"  Beginning somber and contained, the solos sound more beautiful than angry.  It too, however, slowly grows into a ferocious heavy metal beast in it's own right. There's also the tearjerking instrumental tribute to Cliff Burton, \\"To Live As To Die,\\" another gem, clocking in at about 9:48.  This album, listened to from beginning to end, will leave your brain as soup after every listen, but hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Powerful and moving.  A great love story through music.  Adaptations of popular songs may not appeal to all, but I love it.  I really enjoy the variety you get on a single CD - everything from rap to tango.
0316666343|5.0|It's hard to find the right words to describe this book...reading it is an experience no one should miss. I would have liked more resolution for the ending but it also reminded me that stories like this, whether fictional or real, rarely have all the loose threads tied up. Still, it was a wonderful read and an amazing first novel.
0345448898|5.0|This trilogy has occupied more than enough of my time over the past few years. I read the Golden Compass, and then the Subtle Knife.. and at that time, the Amber Spyglass wasn't even out, so I read both of them over again, and then when I read the last one, it all came together. It's a wonderful read, great fun, exciting, full of adventure, and it's all set in a wonderful world unlike anything you could ever dream up. Fortunately for us, Pullman has, and what a world it is... after I was finished reading, I just wanted to go there, to be there, more than anything; and I wished there was more to read. <br />The story is that of young Lyra Belaqua, who you meet in the first pages. You learn that people in this world have \\"Daemons\\" -- magical parts of themselves that take the form of animals (one of Pullman's greatest ideas). The adventure soon starts as Lyra finds out about Dust, and of the North where secret and cruel experiments are going on. It just gets better and better and better in the two books following \\"The Golden Compass,\\" And you'll read for hours on end, mystified. Or, at least I did.<br />The only downfall of these novels is Pullman's obvious opinions of religion, which he makes clear mostly in The Amber Spyglass by killing God and through a smattering of mocking religious allusions (my favorite: preemptive absolution). I have no problem with that; however, I know that many people will. So, I warn you with this: these novels are not for those who are deeply religious. But man, if you can just get past that, or even learn to accept that, then this becomes almost a perfect trilogy.<br />Okay, the other thing about this is that it isn't a children's series. I wouldn't even call it a pre-teen series. Definately 13 and up here. You may see reviews that say that the last book is just sick, but I can tell you honestly that it isn't. Pullman writes that \\"scene\\" so well that it isn't even obvious what has happened, and it all is very fitting, purposeful, and required to the story. Speaking of the end, it will surprise you. No doubt. If you're sensitive, you will cry. If you aren't, you'll probably still cry. It's that powerful. You know the characters so well by the end that it's impossible not to feel their feelings and thoughts yourself. I know I'm being ambiguous. It's like they say -- You'd have to read it to know. So buy this now (no, they're not paying me ;-), and read it, you won't be disappointed.
0151008116|5.0|I wanted to live forever in this book. After I finished it I was upset that I must return to the real world and leave Pi and Richard Parker behind ! <br />It touches the mind and the soul with humor and IMAGINATION!

B00006690G|5.0|THE EMINEM SHOW by Eminem is an great CD. My favorite track is Hailies Song. Em shows us that he has a great voice and really has feelings for his daughter. My Dads Gone Crazy is cute too. My 2nd favorite would be Cleanin' Out my closet. He sings again and its a really deep song. I dont know how anybody could hate em he rules!!! i love him and his music rules!
B000067CPX|2.0|This album is a lot like &quot;Californication&quot; in that it has a lot of mellow songs. But even Californication had some rockin songs like All around the World and Easily. Frankly, this album makes me go to sleep. I can't wait to see what their live shows end up looking like. The only song people can mosh to is By the Way. Then for the rest of the concert RHCP will have a stadium full of sleeping people.<br />That's my story and I'm stickin to it.
0312265859|3.0|I have read and enjoyed all of Janet Evanovich's novels but<BR>as she proceeds through the series they seem to be getting <BR>much thinner.  By this I mean little plot and very little <BR>action development.  Sometimes its like reading a person's <BR>day planner.  I  read them and will continue to do so as I <BR>really like her characters and there are still many laughs.
0671027344|3.0|I picked up this book in the \\"Literature\\" section at my bookstore and did not realize that it was a young adult book until about half way through the novel.  I graduated high school in 1988 so I could relate to a lot of the cultural references throughout the book (set in 1991-1992).  Charlie is a guy that you really want to like and for the most part you will.  The main problem in my opinion was that the book sort of read like a TV movie about a dysfunctional teenager you might see on any network channel.

B000021Y77|4.0|Even if you don't speak german it doesn't take a lot of effort to follow what's going on.  This is a very fun movie with good acting and an entertaining soundtrack.  Action, drama, comedy: to some extent all of these apply a little.  The director plays with time and chance with some very entertaining outcomes.  Why do I recommend buying it you may ask?  Well, this is the type of movie you can watch a few times and get something new from it each time you view it.  If you wind up renting it 3 or 4 times you might as well have just bought it right?  All in all I give it a very strong 4 stars ****.  Enjoy!
0316666343|5.0|I have to admit, I didn't want to even start this book after I had read a review outlining the plot.  As a mother of two daughters ages 14 and 13 and a young son age 8, it was tooclose 4comfort.  But the descriptions of Susie's heaven full of romping dogs and school with no teachers touched me.<BR>   I am so happy i did overcome my trepidation,  because this was such an original thought inspiring story.  The charachters were so well thought out.  The good and the bad.  Susie is able to see all past and present.  It gives hope to anyone who has had someone close to them die.  It also has been very comforting to me because of all the recent childkidnapping cases going on.  I have looked at those faces of Danielle and Elizabeth and now Samantha and really \\"saw\\" these incredible girls and hope they can see the sorroow here on earth.<BR>  Well, I got sappy, but this book is one that will stay with me for a long time to come.  Thanks Alice Sebold for your lovely book.
0380789035|4.0|American Gods is essentially a fine summer read for someone who likes things a little on the dark side.  It's not a horror book exactly, though it has a similar sense of dread and high body count (it tends to stay away from the detailed discriptions of death and dismemberment that most post King and Barker horror writers go for nowadays, which I personally find refreshing).  I guess the best word for it is dark fantasy.  The story is entertaining, with enough twists and turns to keep a reader interested.  It does seem to be reaching for some deeper ideas about man and his religions, but comes up a bit empty on the philosophical front.  Who needs a philosophy book at the beach, though?  It's a fun book, nicely told, and full of nice little tidbits of information about ancient gods and mystic beliefs.  This is a nice mainstream selection for fans of Charles de Lint or Tim Powers.  Enjoy!
B00003CXXR|2.0|Even though I thought this movie was better in some respects to the Lost World, the actors/actresses were very cheesy. William H. Macy is a better actor than this movie lets on or allows him to be. Tea Leoni's character is a bumbling bimbo, who doesn't listen to reason. Somehow the couple of Paul and Amanda Kirby, played by the actors above, persuade Dr. Alan Grant, (Sam Neill), to overfly the second island, Isla Sorna, to view the dinosaurs, offering plenty of donation money to his cause in Montana on digging up fossils.<br />He goes along for the ride, and finds out the couple is not rich or common sense adventurers, but two divorced parents looking for their kid, lost on this island. The adventure starts here, with the dinosaurs including the T-Rex, Raptors, and Pterodactyls chasing the gang through the jungle. Good special effects, but the movie wheezed by, leaving only a vague memory of what happened. Pretty lame plot, and except for the music and the introduction of the Pterodactyls, the movie was a flop. Glad I rented it.
0446608955|3.0|I work in a book store and I read whenever I can. A Walk To Remember was my first book by Nicholas Spark and it definitely pulls all chords of the heart. A sentimental and romantic love story , this novel makes one remember, that there are so many lovely ways to consider life as a precious gift and to make every effort to make it truly beautiful. Though the story at times has certain resemblance to Eric Segal's &quot;Love Story&quot;, it is different and unique in its own way. A must read for all those who believe in the power of love.
B000068PQ0|5.0|A more than worthy follow up to the Soft Bulletin. This album takes up where the last left off without really being anything like it. Evolution, baby! &quot;Yoshimi pt. 1&quot; has been stuck in my head since the first time it drifted from my stereo a dozen listens ago and &quot;Do you Realize??&quot; is so sweet its given me cavities. Everyone needs to buy this album and right away!
B000065U1N|2.0|This is about the DVD. Not the movie which is excellent with  sound, despite not being labelled DTS, that is crystal clear. It could have easily been a 3 hour movie. Just what the guys are looking for after a ton of mindless chickflicks. <br />But wait. I'm stumped - again. What is the rationale of including only a French translation with French, Thai and Chinese subtitles, when such a large Hispanic population exists here in the States with American dollars to spend???<br />Should we assume the Hispanic population in the U.S. doesn't count, but the 2nd. official language of Canada does, coincidentally when many DVD titles are manufactured in Canada??<BR>I'd think the spending power of Hispanics, spending American dollars here, would be greater than that of Canada's French spending Canadian dollars there, simply by dollar conversion. However, the French got the nod, as well as the Thailandese and Chinese.<br />Let's hope if there is to be a 'Director's Cut', that Scott makes the movie a full 3 hour epic and improves on the Languages section to include a Spanish soundtrack and subtitles.<br />Adios!

B00005JKJA|5.0|Although I have considered myself a movie buff since I was 12 or 13, it took until this last year to experience David Lynch, one of the most controversial directors in the history of film.  I avoided him for years because the people who seemed to like him were the kind of film-snobs I couldn't stand to be around, and I had little interest in \\"artistic\\" movies (artistic is OK, but weird for the sake of weird is a waste of time).  Until two months ago, when I watched \\"Mulholland Drive\\" for the first time.<br />And, wow.  W-O-W wow.<br />The first time I watched it - and if you really want to get something out of \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" you have to invest some time in it - I got the distinct impression that I was watching something great, but I felt like an outsider trying to look through a soaped-over window.  So I watched it again, and read some opinions, and talked with some people, and came to some conclusions.  What's the solution?  I don't think there is ONE right answer, but I believe mine is correct - but what's the point in spoiling the movie when I'm trying to get you to watch it on your own?<br />In fact, I'm not even going to do the usual plot summary, because I would either give too much away or tell it from my point of view, neither of which are fair.  It's a mystery, set in Hollywood, and Mulholland Drive plays a major role in the development of the story - that's the best one can do, and it's about what you'd get from reading the back of the box.  \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is meant to be experienced.<br />Although I can't think of any other movies to which I can compare \\"MD\\" (except other Lynch films I've seen since), the closest thing I can think of is the video game series \\"Silent Hill\\" (Now Approaching: Nerdville).  \\"Silent Hill\\" is incredibly confusing, full of twists, symbols, and bits and pieces of clues.  Like \\"SH,\\" \\"MD\\" is something that requires you to pay full attention to what's going on, and you have to disbelieve that which you originally thought to be true in order to have some inkling of what's happening.<br />Does that make a good film?  Yes, I think so, although I know many others do not.  You get out of Lynch films what you put into them: if you think about it and try to connect the dots, it's like solving a particularly hard logic problem (and yes, there IS logic here, I promise).  It's a great feeling, and you can appreciate the film all the more because of it.  If putting your brain to work is your idea of a good time (even if you don't do it every time you watch a movie), \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is an outstanding jigsaw puzzle of a film.<br />Final Grade: Ae true in order to have some inkling of what's happening.  <br />Does that make a good film?

B000063JDE|5.0|\\"Blue Velvet\\" was my second foray into Lynch, following my positive experience with \\"Mulholland Drive.\\"  Where \\"MD\\" was a WOW experience, \\"BV\\" totally destroyed my idea of what movies can do and rebuilt it again, bigger, better, and more powerful than before.  Rarely will a movie stick with you like \\"BV,\\" haunting your waking thoughts, even if you didn't like it.  Rarely can a movie look like a work of art while communicating a point not necessarily original but definitely done in a new way.  \\"BV\\" is a masterpiece of cinema in every sense of that word.<br />Young Jeffrey, played by Kyle MacLachlan, arrives in his small hometown of Lumberton, USA from college after his father suffers a heart attack.  While walking around his neighborhood, he finds a human ear in a field, and being the fine, upstanding citizen he is, he takes it to the police.  After talking with the detective assigned to the case, Jeffrey meets his young, high-school aged daughter (a fresh-faced Laura Dern, nary 18 when this film was shot).  They hatch a plan to investigate the ear case, and Jeffrey ends up in the apartment of Isabella Rossellini, and begins to discover a horrific circle of drugs, violence, and sexual deviancy surrounding the psychotic Frank (played to perfection by Dennis Hopper).  Jeffrey's world unravels as he finds himself in over his head in something he doesn't understand.<br />Although not as shocking today as it was in 1986, \\"BV\\" is highly charged, tackling taboo, closed-door issues without batting an eyelash.  It isn't as weird as \\"MD,\\" but \\"BV\\" still has that Lynchian feel of otherworldliness about it; Lumberton is a mirror-image of many small towns, and one must wonder if this isn't what's going on behind the neighbor's closed doors.  That being said, \\"BV\\" isn't for everyone.  It's not artsy-fartsy like \\"City of Lost Children,\\" nor is it conventional cinema in any sense of that term.  It's something unto itself, and for those that don't like Lynch's style, there won't be much of redeeming value in this film.  It's cinema that requires attention and thought, and it engages the audience as much as any book or painting could - and that's saying something.  The acting is all top-notch, from MacLachlan's sharply divided protagonist to Dern's almost symbolic portrayal of the \\"normal,\\" to Rossellini's abused woman at the end of her rope, to Hopper's out-and-out, but believable, evil sociopath.  Add to that Lynch's attention to detail, and \\"BV\\" is, in a literal sense, a perfect film.<br />The new special edition DVD presents the film in dazzling anamorpohic widescreen with a solid (and surprisingly dynamic) 5.1 soundtrack.  The \\"Mysteries of Love\\" documentary doesn't really shed any light on the film, but it does tell the story of how it was brought to the screen, which is interesting.  The deleted scenes are pretty blah - the movie stands on its own.  But, for the video and audio quality alone (the blues leap off the TV and kick you in the face they are so sharp), this is a reference-quality disc.<br />Lynch may not be for everyone.  If you haven't experienced Dave yet, \\"Blue Velvet\\" would make an excellent introduction.  Rent \\"BV\\" before you buy it, but if you like it, this disc needs to be in your collection.

B000066NW0|5.0|So young and so amazing! Her album proves that she truly deserves the respect of the singer/songwriters today like alanis or dido, and certainly does not deserve the bashing or rep given to &quot;a typical pop princess.&quot; Her songs are all written by her, and the lyrics to all her songs are easy to relate to, and truly heartfelt. She has a really nice, soft, unique voice, which would probably be &quot;music to the ears&quot; if she just sang acapella. It's not computerized like britney's is half the time, and she doesn't scream &quot;or over-sing&quot; like christina. She really stresses being confident and happy with who you are and is the perfect role model for people who seem to want to change and just go along with the crowd. You can tell that she really is HERSELF, and doesn't plan on changing one thing. Songs like &quot;skater boi&quot; and &quot;anything but ordinary&quot; are full of awesome energy and cheerful spirit. &quot;Unwanted&quot;,&quot;Complicated and &quot;Losing Grip&quot; are more edgy and have kind of an angry feel, &quot;Complicated&quot; being the acception, because all though it's edgy it isn't has hard as the other two. In the songs &quot;Naked&quot; , &quot;My World&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Mobile&quot; Avril really expresses herself well through her lyrics, and they are so easy to relate to! &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I'm with You&quot; show her more sensitive, and mellow side, and are about boyfriend/girlfriend oriented love. In the song &quot;Things I&quot;ll never Say&quot; her vocals are often compared to Alanis Morisette's voice, and i can understand why. <br />Every song has a different feel and has it's own flavor. You could tell that the music isn't over-produced and have lyrics that all the sound the same like most of today's pop. I predict that maybe she wont sell out arenas liek britney, but she will have her big share of devoted fans...me included
B00005JLDW|4.0|Its a rare film that manages to deliver on its promises these days.  Men in Black II felt like a bogged-down, too-short, commercialized nightmare compared to the first, and the much-ballyhooed Road to Perdition ended up being as hollow as a rotten tree stump.  Thankfully, Reign of Fire recognized its limitations before marketing, and the studios showed a great deal of wisdom by marketing it as a B-grade monster flick  which is truthful to the last t.<br />In a new spin on the post-apocalyptic genre (and a great new entry into that field, I might add), a construction crew in London awakens a dragon.  Yes, those mythical beasts are scientifically real (but you already knew that from the previews, right?)  In no time at all, the dragons have multiplied and destroyed much of civilization, sending the survivors into tiny fortresses where they are attempting to outlive the dragons cycle  because once the food runs out, they will eventually die.  American Psychos Christian Bale was there when the big lizards woke up, and now hes leading a plucky group of survivors in northern England.  When infighting and dragon attacks lead to the destruction of the groups only food source, things look bleak until Yankee Matthew McConaughey literally rolls to the doorstep in a tank, ready to kick some dragon butt.<br />At first, Reign of Fire looks like its going to degenerate into a propaganda film for American Know-How and Cheesy One-Liners a la Independence Day, but instead takes the high road, skewing both American bravado and British understatement until ideologies and differences are forced aside in a fight for survival.  That may be giving the movie more credit than it deserves, as in the end it does become a monster-movie battle of injured survivors vs. Big Meanies, but director Rob Bowmen must be given credit for following in the footsteps of 50s and 60s B-grade sci-fi/monster fare and at least giving lip service to plot and character development.<br />What makes Reign of Fire so slick is that the monsters are handled like well monsters.  The dragons rarely appear on screen (you actually see most of them in the previews), and each one is treated as a horrific menace that must be dealt with to save immediate life and limb.  Add to that some really awesome post-apocalyptic sets (the London set is great, even if it was mostly digital) that made great use of an obviously limited budget.<br />Reign of Fire is old-school, unpretentious fun.  Its not an art film by a longshot  its a Hollywood movie, full of bigger-than-life creatures and outrageous action situations.  Its pure escapism, and great escapism at that, not to mention a worthy inductee into the canon of post-apocalyptic films.  Definitely worth the price of admission.<br />Final Grade: B (of course)o plot and character development.<br />What makes Reign of Fire so slick is that the monsters are handled like well monsters.

6302787564|4.0|Well, this is a bummer of a movie. I will not kid you about that. If you are wanting a happy ending, then this movie will not work. However, the idea of this movie is to explore the frustration of individuals when many things go wrong in a short amount of time. The \\"falling down\\" that Micheal Douglas' character experiences is a falling down from life, and a falling down from the ills of society, and a falling down from a relationship with his wife that no longer exists. It is like a psychoanalytical Die Hard; we see and empathize with Micheal Douglas' character as he becomes frustrated with society. (It is fitting that he should be stuck in traffic in Los Angeles when going ballistic). He becomes upset with the situation of not being able to see his daughter, and then experiences an ill journey through Los Angeles, encountering gang members, white supremicists, and stubborn fast food employees (okay, well I can tolerate the fast food employees). The journey that he takes emcompasses a little of what we feel inside when we are angry at society or people; perhaps the only difference is that many of us do not act on those urges or thoughts. I found this movie very powerful and I thought that Micheal Douglas was exceptional in his role as a semi-deranged individual who has had enough of society. Like one critic said, this is a movie that is doomed to an unhappy ending. I am not rating this movie on the ending, however. It is a very gripping and realistic portrayel of a man who loses his composure and acts on an impulse when things do not go his way. I found this movie powerful, and despite many of the reviews that said that the characters were too stereotypical, I still believe that this is a very realistic depiction of society. This movie analyzes what we do not want to express outwardly, and examines the people who are pushed to the brink of taking action. I recommend this movie, especially for psychology buffs out there.
B000067CPX|5.0|People toss out opinions like trash. Don't listen to them.  Listen and FEEL this album then judge for yourself.  If you were ever a true fan of the RHCP you will get it and enjoy it all.  If not, you never were.
B00003CXE7|5.0|When I first saw this movie when it first came out of video, I didn't like it at all. I thought it was dumb and way overrated and thought that it did not deserve the Oscar for Best Picture at all. I waited until a couple weeks ago before I watched it for the 2nd time and when I was done, I loved it. I don't know what it was but I'm completely dazzled by that movie now. I guess a year ago I just didn't have an appreciation for it but now I do. It's a masterpiece and definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar. I'd have to say my favorite thing about the movie is the directing. Ridley Scott has such an original way of directing. So original that you can tell by watching one of his movies that he's the director. Scott tells stories in his movies using a perfect mixture of emotions and scenery. But you'd have to see the movie and have a true appreciation for films to know what I'm talking about. A lot of viewers (myself included) are going to be really wowed by those fight scenes in the coliseum. They are the scenes that you remember most about the movie because they are suspenseful, creative, gross (in a good way), and well-directed. I personally am not grossed out by ANYTHING so I can't give a good idea of whether or not other people will be. But I guess I could say that you COULD be grossed out but that would only happen in a couple of scenes. The other big scene is the big fight scene in near the beginning. That sets the tone for how the characters act and who they are. Now, we come to Russell Crowe. I know he has a Hollywood reputation for being a 'bad boy' but that's not why I'm not crazy about his performance in this movie. In fact, out of his 3-in-a-row Best Actor Oscar nominations (2000 for 'The Insider', 2001 for 'Gladiator', 2002 for 'A Beautiful Mind') this is the one role that I didn't think he deserved to win for. It's not that his acting is bad, it's just that his acting in this movie is too subtle and not important enough for the movie. That's why I especially surprised to see him beat out Tom Hanks and Ed Harris for the Oscar last year when he should have taken it home the year before for 'The Insider'. But don't misunderstand. He's a great actor who just needs to brush up on his Hollywood social skills. So, in short, you should see this movie at least twice (but balance out the intervals) in case you're not crazy about it the first time that you see it.

B00005T30L|4.0|GHOST WORLD is an intelligent and somewhat subversive comedy. It's cynical tone plays like an updated version of a Billy Wilder movie. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are fine in their respective roles. Some of the things that the young women do in this film are not nice, but smack of reality. Steve Buscemi was also good as a blues fan that has all but given up on love. <br />On a side note, it was so refreshing to see different blues artists explored via Buscemi's character than the standard \\"Top Ten\\" in other films that make reference to blues artists. Skip James is just one of the fine blues musicians mentioned in the film.<br />If you're looking for an intelligent movie with teenage age characters as the leads, this one is a good bet. Also, expect to hear some excerpts of some fine, underappreciated blues recordings.
B000067CPX|5.0|One of the most fantastic aspects about the Summer of 2002 in music is the ability of solid contemporary music acts to comeback with new material, outdo themselves, and prove that they can still make great music for the masses (i.e. Chilli Peppers, Dave Matthews Band, Wilco). <br />\\"By The Way\\" opens with everyone's favorite California Son's in top form. While [especially] John Frusciante leads each track, and brings it home with a skilled and intense range of guitar, it goes without saying that \\"By The Way\\" was certainy a collective effort from the Chilli Peppers, but then again, every Chilli Peppers album is. Kiedis comes through strong, the red hot vocalist, lacing his sultry vocals throughout. Flea, short of slap bass here, shows his versitility as a bassist. And like his bossoms companions, Smith too can be heard trying new beats and rythms. All things considered, \\"By the Way\\" exhibits a matured, even innovative sound from the Chilli Peppers, grown up song-stylists. They have created a masterful record and album, each song stands on its own (hear the title track, \\"Dosed\\", \\"Zephyr Song\\", \\"I Could Die for You\\", \\"Midnight\\", and \\"Cabron\\" for details), and for a band that is known for the wild stage antics and relentless punk-funk attitude, age has made the Chilli Peppers musical abilities wiser, skilled, honed, and ready to rock. <br />Truly a step forward for the Chilli Peppers, \\"By The Way\\" stands a formidable contender in the music scene today, as the Pop Empire of Britney Spears, N'Sync, and the Backstreet Boys gradually crumbles. And by the way, musical integrity, ambition, skill, and insturmental mastery leave groups like the Chilli Peppers perpetually ahead of their time.
B000002JR8|5.0|Admit it. They are the KINGS of Metal. No if's and's or but's. Probably their best CD ever, just above Great Southern Trendkill, Far Beyond Driven delievers. Name any heavy band out there and Pantera is either their idol or they are their slaves. I do have to admit that Driven doesn't have the likes of a Heroin overdose induced Suicide Note I & II, but it does have Broken, Good Friends and a Bottle of Pills, Hard Lines and Sunken Cheeks and of course 25 years. I'm just amazed that some of the youngsters of today think that Slipknot is the end all. Admittedly Slipknot is great, but they bow to Pantera. You want heavy, deep and psychotic? Go Pantera.

I can't praise this album enough, other than to say it is one of my favourite records of the past decade! Listen and you'll agree. Please record again guys!!
B000001Y79|4.0|I think the structure really saves the album.  They start with Spiderwebs, a great song and extremely catchy.  This energy carries through past Happy Now, which is wonderfully biting, but then the album sags in content.  Of course, right when you could give up, Sixteen saves the day, pulling you back into the great sound of the beginning.  Climaxing with Don't Speak, it drops off.  End of This pulls you back with the same pain as Happy Now.  And the last song, Tragic Kingdom, is strange in the extreme.  I suggest a few forced listenings.  Once you accept the style it's a satsfying end to this overall good album.
B00004Z459|3.0|Evereyone's raving about Hybrid Theory. I'ts a good album, don't get me wrong, but the only reason it hasn't turned me into  Linkin Park fan is the fact that the band has so much potential for so much more. When the boys revealed their musical influences on MTV i marveled. Faith No More! Tool! &quot;These kids are going to make some noise&quot; i said to myself. I bought the album, and instead of hearing inspired noise, i got uninspired, almost boyband-ish noise. but thats enough, now onto the good stuff. The songs lyrics, which have a ranting-yet-catchy theme, are poetic, very thought provoking in nature. Songs like In the End and Crawling make you want to listen to them again and again and think deeply about the meanings. This album is a good change from the other angst driven bands out there like Sum-41 or Hoobstank. It may not be ground breaking, but i want to keep it in my collection nevertheless. Here's hoping for better things in their new album, Reanimation.

B000002AHC|5.0|All in all this is the most sonically pleasing rock record I've ever experienced. There are moments in 'Surrealistic Pillow' and 'Waiting for the Sun' that approach what the Byrds do here, but not as consistently, not always as dreamy, not as softly cleansing. You become like a buoy floating in the harbor of your thoughts and dreams, your wishes and misgivings, and on . . . and on . . . and on . . .<br />And the lyrics, though very poetic, are relatively simple . . . never too many verses, no overbearing syntax, no belabored argumentation, and no beleaguered metaphors! The Byrds say or allude to what they mean, then move on. Yet the confluence of melody, harmony and timbre leads one to feel something very astounding is going on, that much, much more is being said that what's carried by the words. While they're being sung, they inhabit and project a spiritual and psychological significance far beyond what they would if merely glanced at on the written page.<br />There's something overwhelming about listening to this, almost like going into a swoon. It's not any particular detail. How does all this flow together in such a lovely fashion? Where does all the profundity stem from? I don't know. I've been grooving on this record for thirty-five years, and I still don't know. In a way, I hope I never find out (there's something about mystery that can nurture the connection between the heart and mind). Then again, it would be revelatory to discover the source of this brand of sonic subtlety somewhere in my soul, so as to be able to send it out, gently, to touch others (friends, lovers, acquaintances, associates). Free love, anyone?!?!?!<br />[Not to shatter the mood, but I don't understand why anyone would compare the premature ejaculations of Pink Floyd's \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" with the lengthy foreplay of \\"Space Odyssey\\". To put it a different way: Floyd's song is all mental; the Byrds' song is not to be contained in any shape or form, or on any distinct level. Floyd's song is like a street fight; whereas the Byrds take one into a moving confrontation, held in the magnanimous arms of the Great Spirit. \\"Space Odyssey\\" in much closer in tone to the Rolling Stones' astounding \\"2000 Light Years from Home\\", which, though, is a tad more sinister.]<br />[\\"Tribal Gathering\\" chronicles an historical event (A Gathering of the Tribes), which occurred during the Summer of Love (1966) in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.]<br />[Why would anyone say that \\"Artificial Energy\\" is an anti-drug song? Maybe it is, but the way it tells the story, the way it sings of the experience - it takes you, carries you along with it, allows you to feel what the singers/musicians feel about it all.

B000065U1N|3.0|Ladies and gentleman if you're looking for a war movie with actual substance and raw emmotion then this is the film that you should pop into your dvd player sit back and enjoy the sound of popping machine guns.  If you're looking for an intricate story then this is not for you.<BR>  Simply put this film contains complicated army plans and enough screaming that you do feel like you're there. Unfortunately Josh Hartnett and Ewan Macgregor find themselves shoved out of the spotlight while the special effects and gore takes centerstage.
B00005QATY|5.0|I loved the movie.  Despite what other bad comments others have made about the film, I believe its a sure classic.  I would really suggest that you make this a part of you DVD collection.  Along with the great movie, one of the extras includes the music video of \\"Man of Constant Sorrow.\\"  Its great!  I have two words for these reviewers picking this movie apart....CHILL OUT!... Just enjoy the movie for what it is, a light hearted, deep south comedy!<BR>If your a TRUE southerner, and enjoy shows like \\"The Andy Griffith Show\\" with southern humor, this is a must have!!  Its one of those movies you'll watch over and over again!
0064471837|3.0|Right, here it goes then. I'm a big fantasy lover and think there is a lot of great fantasy being produced for the Teen/Young Adult market and I've seen tons of press about how wonderful Sabriel is so I decided to give it a try. And it was...ok. I didn't think it was awful but on the otherhand I could recommend a stack of other novels that I enjoyed much more than this. For one it failed my 're-readability' test because the characters and the story where simply not interesting enough to warrant a second go around. There has to be enough depth to the characters and remaining mystery or ambiguity to make me go back and re-read. Really good books will reveal something new everytime. It also fails my 'gotta read something else by this author/sequel' test in that Garth Nix's writing is competent, but not compelling. His writing and descriptions are workmen like, keeping the plot moving, but there are no brillant passages of description that truly convey the horror of the land of the Dead or probe the awesome power and responsibility Sabriel must feel ringing one of her necromancer's bells.<br />I am mostly disappointed by the fact that Nix has come up with an interesting twist on necromancy and a wonderful new way to work magic (the bells) but hasn't really done anything with them. It was as if having the idea was enough but he couldn't be bothered to flesh out the complexities or history behind them. There are other intriguing ideas such as the Charter Magic, but you never find out how it works or what it's purpose is. Extremely frustrating! I'm not saying he has to spell out everything, but it's a shame to let it a great concept die unexplored. Another thing that bothered me was how did two such opposite lands develop in the same world? One uses magic exclusively while the other has both technology and magic?? Again, Nix presents the idea but never illuminates it. Mostly I was suprised that at the end of reading so long a book (with rather large type)I didn't feel as if I really had read all that much that was all that great.<br />I can't say I recommend this book whole-heartly although if you want to check it out your time won't totally be wasted. ...f I really had read all that much that was all that great.<br />I can't say I recommend this book whole-heartly although if you want to check it out your time won't totally be wasted. ...
0060931736|5.0|Originally published in 1961 in a single issue of the New Yorker, upon release, 'The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie' set off a worldwide firestorm of praise which hasn't substantially abated with the passage of the decades.<br /><br />Though the novel has been adapted for the stage, made into an excellent Academy Award-winning film, and a six-part PBS special, the book has sadly received little attention from academia in America, though in England the scholarly attention shown the book and its author, the late Muriel Spark, has been generous. Thankfully, novelist and critic John Updike has been a steady and dedicated Spark advocate since the Sixties, reviewing each of her books in the New Yorker upon release, thus vastly broadening her American audience.<br /><br />The story of a bright, individualistic, and defiant Scottish schoolteacher troublesomely employed by a restrictive conservative school for girls in 1930s Edinburgh, the novel moves effortlessly backward and forward in time, and though never less than buoyant in tone, has so many extremely subtle layers that it reads like an organic product of nature; nowhere does the reader sense an author's intruding hand or mind. Wise almost beyond reason, its gracious prose continually underscores a number of poetic, psychological, and spiritual truths that subtly illuminate the ostensibly simple story of Miss Brodie and her influence over six particular students.<br /><br />Initially structured around an act of betrayal and a question of identity, the answer to the mystery is casually given midway through the story, making it obvious to the undiscerning that the genuine focus of the novel lies elsewhere. Its complex themes of individuality, group identity, hero worship, sublimation, proxy relationships, and repression are effortlessly woven together and punctuated by symbolism so fine many readers may fail to perceive it at all.<br /><br />Less overtly funny than most of Spark's fictions, 'The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie' stands out distinctly from all of Spark's other works, perhaps because it is the most autobiographical of all her novels: with this work, Spark threw her fictional net wider than she ever had before or has since. An excellent introduction to her remarkable oeuvre, readers may find themselves reflecting endlessly on its meanings, nuances, and intentions. Ultimately, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie leaves the reader with more questions than answers: as in life, the larger mysteries remain.<br /><br />Recently chosen as one of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th Century, 'The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie' is certainly that.ands out distinctly from all of Spark's other works, perhaps because it is the most autobiographical of all her novels: with this work, Spark threw her fictional net wider than she ever had before or has since.

B000000WCA|4.0|some of the songs the spice girls did, will never leave, no matter how much some people want them too. The spice girls are kick-ass girls. I bought this album when I was younger & I re-bought it, just a few days ago. No matter how much I want to not remember my kiddie \\"girl power!\\" attitude from when I was 11 or how much I loved the spice girls, I can't help but admitt I love all their songs. This album is great. If you like poppy/slow songs then get this.
B00005JG6Q|2.0|After starting to view anime's (mainly manga) over the years i came across what is hailed to be the most classic anime of all, Akira. I must be the only one in the world that was bored as hell during this movie. The plot was excellent though i didn't really like the characters at all. The bull-headed Tetsuo is a stupid character with no real depth apart from his hatred. The action(yeah right) scenes were boring and dull to the point where i was falling asleep. Overall i must say that there are much better movies out there (ie. Ninja Scrolls which kicks [butt],Ghost in the shell, Samurai X) that people should own before buying the dullest movie EVER
B00005TT77|3.0|Having never seen the movie, I judge this soundtrack based on its musical merits alone, and based on that, this CD falls short of expectations (though it does provide some great moments).  The re-interpretations are what should make this soundtrack worth buying, but they don't.  \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" is my favorite Beatles song, so I was thrilled to see it here, in an excellent cover by the Wallflowers that barely strays from the original tune, but updates it to a more 21st century sound.  There are other highlights, too--Eddie Vedder's \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\\", Ben Folds' McCartney-esque \\"Golden Slumbers,\\" and the Vines' excellent \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" (one of the Beatles' most underrated songs) are all great to listen to, if un-adventuresome.  It's the reinterpretations where you find the real failures.<br />\\"Two Of Us,\\" though it doesn't seem so at first, is drastically different than the original number that opened Let it Be.  The Beatles' version was never intended as a duet; this interpretation works, but not particularly well.  All in all, it's a clumsy start to the album.<br />Chocolate Genius' \\"Julia\\" may not honor the original intent of the song (it was written by Lennon for his deceased mother; here it appears as more of a love song) but it's still a fine tune.<br />Howie Day's \\"Help!\\" is by far the best of the re-interpretations.  It's a completely different song at this tempo and with this arrangement; I always thought the Beatles' version was an overrated song, but this version seems not to get the attention it deserves.<br />After that, the soundtrack finishes with its three worst songs.  Paul Westerberg's \\"Nowhere Man\\" is a good concept--the stripping down of the song to its bare bones.  The guitar in the background is beautiful as well, but it's impossible to get over the horrible nasal vocals that Westerberg provides.  He tries to be Bob Dylan, and fails miserably.  Then comes \\"Revolution\\" by the Stereophonics, easily the soundtrack'sworst song.  I can't bear to listen to it; the single released by the Beatles was full of energy and had a great guitar part in the background.  This version would be best put to use as a vomit inducer.  The last song on the soundtrack is a laughably bad cover of \\"Let it Be.\\"  One of the Beatles' best songs, one would think that you couldn't go wrong with it, but Nick Cave proves that you can make any song sound bad.  His arrangement is boring and flat, and the nasal monotone in which he sings the words \\"Let it Be\\" throughout the song is just ridiculous.<br />It might be painful for some Beatles' fans to hear some of their best tunes mauled, but if you ignore the last three tracks, this soundtrack is well worth the purchase.
B00004TH83|2.0|...but Lara Fabian doesn't give the same emotion in these songs as when she's singing in French or Italian. I bought the English album as a &quot;test&quot;, and frankly, her other albums have better song selections than this one.  And she just doesn't sing the same... I miss the passion she instills in her French album songs.
B00006690G|5.0|Another great album from the bleached wordsmith . No political correctness , and no subject out of bounds as Eminem takes full advantage of the freedom of speech to make buffoons out of his detractors . He cleverly parodies all the negative , stereotypical images of himself to highlight how foolish , and hypocritical the \\" moral guardians of society \\" really are , and it's WONDERFULL ! Oh yeah , the tunes are wicked as well .<br />In an age where most pop music can comatose , thank god for Eminem !
B00005MKA3|5.0|This is one of Bob's more political works. Recorded around the time that the last colonialized African nations were fighting for independence. \\"Zimbabwe,\\" \\"Africa Unite,\\" \\"One Drop,\\" \\"Baylon System\\" and \\"Ride Natty Ride\\" all deal with African liberation and/or the teachings of rastafarianism's place in this scheme of things. \\"Ambush in the Night\\" and \\"Top Rankin'\\" (sometimes known as \\"They Don't Wanna See Us Unite\\") deal with the assassination attempt on Marley in 1976. While musically speaking, this is a great album, you might wanna read up on rastafarianism and recent African history to fully get what Bob's talking about.
B00003CY0V|2.0|John Travolta, a scientology fan, pretends to be a Luddite who is radical and technically-savvy. L. Ron Hubbard would have been proud of his friend's portrayal of a tempermental dictator who seems to find human life a disposable commodity. He pursues his own brand of global justice, employing gun-toting goons, hackers, and a bevy of pseudo-models to entice and simultaneously distract the hackers. (Yes, I know it sounds self-defeating).<br />In his own grandiose scheme gone awry, Travolta hires Jackman, apparently because of his legendary technical skills, but probably because of his charming James Dean-esque looks. It takes a thin plot line about Jackman's past and a few no-means-yes innuendos from Halle Berry's character to entice our nerd protagonist. He reluctantly joins forces with the two, trying to keep his libido in check in the process.<br />Several special effects and sexual undertones later, and you'll realize why everything (from beginning to end) is completely predictable about this film.<BR>The director does have a visually provocative way of handling action scenes. It keeps the movie's rating from falling any lower.<br />Strictly bargain-bin material.
B00005JLDW|5.0|No this is no Oscar winner.  But for the sheer imagery of the dragons it kicks.  I had see the previews for 3 months and I could not wait for this movie to show up on the big screen.  I got to see it on an Ultrascreen and was not disappointed one bit.  Matthew M really played the part of an over-zealous dragonslayer with perfection; his chawed off ceegar and shaved head further conveyed his madness (and his beefed-up bod was easy eye candy!).  His madness equalled the character of Mad Max.  Quinn tho handsome was a bit washy but showed his true colors in the end as the boy who saw the dragon's release to the hero 20 years later.  This is an eye feast and as my movie companion commented last nite, \\"Intense, man!\\"
B00005JLDW|4.0|If you're looking for the English Patient then you should skip this movie. But if your expectations are a little more in line with the action genre then you won't be disappointed.<br />The dragons are sufficiently threatening and look great and the hero is complex enough to keep you interested in the plot. McConaughey is a little over the top but so what - he's supposed to be a dragon slayer, maybe those guys are like that in \\"real life.\\"
B00004RFFS|5.0|A stunning cinematic piece that deserves much credit, especially due to the actors and production team, a fresh new addition to the \\"Vampire story\\" and derived from a classic series of novels by Anne Rice. <BR>The Vampire is the most sensual character in creation and has been worked well in this film.<BR>Two thumbs up!!!<br />                         ...
B0000640VO|4.0|I agree with another reviewer love the sound of French and the movie goes so fast you hardly notice the sub titles.  The story line was nice, fairy tale like, fantasy, but such a nice thought if we all had the power to do such good to make others happier.  It reminded me of Chocolat, which I think I liked better than this one, but by all means see for yourself and give your review.  I am hard to impress, been a reader for years.
B00003CXS4|4.0|'Snatch' has many similiar story elements to 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' but has a better cast and, in my opinion, is just as much fun to watch.  In the immediate wake of Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' it seemed that every shootemup movie was being compared to Tarantino's work.  While I would still place PF and RD slightly above Ritchie's movies, I love them and feel that they can both be fairly compared to Tarantino's.<br />'Snatch' has a great soundtrack and the DVD will even let you turn on subtitles exclusively for the pikeys.  One thing that I like about Snatch is that, like in Lock Stock, all the scenes of violence are never shown directly.  While there is still more than a healthy amount of violence in these movies, it is nice that you never actually have to see someone getting shot or stabbed.  <br />Oh and, I almost forgot to mention, this movie is hilarious.  Rent it first to see if its your kind of movie, but if you really love Tarantino and were disappointed by the last few incarnations of 'from dusk til dawn.' you may just want to go ahead and buy this one.

Only the last two feature Clarice Starling, the first revolves around Will Graham.
B000067CQK|5.0|This cd is a little pricey but well worth it! The bonus material (some of wich are previously unreleased mixes) are fantastic and as for Ziggy! Well, let's just say, rock was never the same after He came on the scene. The sound, the look and the sheer uniqueness of it made it an instant classic and it still holds up after 30 years! This is by far the best of vintage Bowie and by far, a whole lot better than 99% of the 'new' music being produced today.<br />A must have for any music fan!
B0000636UN|1.0|Ok, first off I am a huge fan of Sheryl Crow (or at least WAS).  I own her albums and play them frequently.  So, when I heard she had a new release, I was right there purchasing it.  I should have left the shrink wrap on because it was not only a huge disappointment, it left me wondering at exactly what point did Crow decide to transform herself into Britney Spears or some other wanna-be?  This album is hideous.  While Crow has never been one for profound lyrics, the songs on this album sound like a child wrote them.  Self-serving, sappy, jingle-like tunes are the end result and this is by far one of the worst albums I have ever encountered.  During the entire album, you can almost picture Crow hamming it up at the microphone, trying to sound like a teen success story.  The whole experience leaves you wondering &quot;What happened?&quot;  I mean are you kidding?  If you haven't bought it, don't.  If you have, then my advice is to burn it or use it as a coaster.  It doesn't even deserve one star.
B00003W8NM|5.0|this movie is the best ive ever seen.  norton is off the hook, and pitt is great, as usual.  if u have seen this movie and didnt laugh at least once, you didnt get it.  i guess my sense of humor is just warped.
0812550757|2.0|While I greatly enjoyed Ender's Game, I had heard that Speaker for the Dead was an entirely new experience and not very much of a sequel in spirit.  That said, I am not basing any of the following statements on the (justifiable) bitterness a wide departure from the original can earn a sequel.<br />Speaker is just not very well written.  I say this with regret as a fan of Orson Scott Card.  The motivations of the main characters are unbelievable.  They either react with entirely too much emotion at the drop of a hat, or stand by idly while their world collapses around them.  <br />This is aggravated by the fact that Card tries too hard to use Portuguese.  It's not that his command of the language is wrong, I have no idea whether or not that is the case.  But rather characters flow into their 'native language' at the most cliche of times purely for dramatic effect.  It is very poorly done.<br />The flow of the story is awkward.  The conflict/mystery is presented well enough, but a huge amount of time goes by while the main character deals more with interpersonal relationships than with the major plotline.  By the time Card gets back to the meat of the story, you'll greet it with a shrug and an &quot;Eh..&quot;<br />The climax itself suffers because of all this- the mystery starts to sputter out and nothing really happens, especially considering the way Card handles space travel and communication.  The ending is slow, and left me wondering whether I should have waited to buy the next novel in the series.
B0000508U6|5.0|I bought this album a little over a year go, and just got around to reviewing it now. but that doesnt mean i havent been listening to it non-stop for the past year.  &quot;parachutes&quot; the debut release from Coldplay is a peace of art. the first song &quot;Don't Panic&quot; is one of my favorites, with down tones, and great lyrics, backed by an unbelievable chorus. number 2 &quot;shiver&quot; the first single (even though most heard &quot;yellow&quot; first) is another great song, great lyrics, chorus, and music again. songs 3 and 4 are also very good, especially &quot;spies.&quot; number 5 &quot;yellow&quot; the second single, is the best song here, its a true epic, with unbelievable guitars, stellar lyrics, and a great message, its just perfect. numbers 6-10 are all above average, most notably #6 &quot;trouble&quot; the third single, and #10 &quot;everything's not lost&quot;.  stick around till the complete end of #10 to find an extra special hidden track, which can classify as one of the best tracks on the cd.
B000065V1V|5.0|The Master has created yet another classic work of art! The soothing tones of Mr. Bowie lead you through a dark and divine place of unexpected beauty and subtlety.

0385312083|4.0|This book should only be read in softcover, and if possible one that has been dogeared and has a slightly torn cover.  Slaughterhouse Five at one time had me feeling that I knew the answer to all of mankinds problems and at other times asking myself \\"what the hell did that paragraph mean?\\"  Is Vonnegut Billy? Am I Billy? Are you?  Who knows?  Who cares? Maybe we all are a little piece of Billy in our own little ways.  But, this is not a literary critic to analyze characters and plots and subplots and symbolism. They are all there but you only have to find them if you feel it is important to you. I felt that Vonnegut's style of short paragraphs and catchy tag lines kept me reading the next page and then the next and all of a sudden I was closing in page 205, 206, 207...  And I started reading more slowly because, like all books I enjoy, I didn't want it to end.  I enjoyed the ride.  I didn't catch all the sites along the way, but I can take that trip again and again.  And, I plan on it.  I recommend you invest the time to read this book.  If you hate it, you hate it and you can sell it at a garage sale. But, if after you finished it you said \\"did I miss something or is the auther insane?\\" then reread it at another time in another mood in another setting.  This was my first book by Vonnegut that I have read. I will read more of his work, but he has to be taken in stages.  Go for it.  Read it.
B00005JLDW|3.0|This is one that the kids will really love.  It has great special effects and reasonably decent acting, however, it doesn't live up to all the advertising it was given.  It has several points in it where, they started something but did not finish them.  The accents were a little hard to understand.  Overall, not a bad movie, it just didn't live up to it's potential in my opinion.  I would only buy this one on DVD because my child really liked it.

B0000026NC|4.0|There is nothing even faintly cool about mid-eighties era Pink Floyd:<br /><br />Songwriting guru and artistic director Roger Waters is now a thing of the past. Worse, with the old fellow's grumpy back turned, the rest of the boys have embraced unashamedly the dehumanising stadium rock which so aggravated him, and helped formed the core of Floyd's artistic oeuvre, in the first place.<br /><br />The album they're touring is, frankly, terrible. The vogue production values of the day - adopted by the production crew with the enthusiasm of freshly brainwashed moonies - are to saturate everything that moves, however lumberingly (and boy, can the Floyd lumber!) with massive, stadium-emulating digital reverberation (the sort you wouldn't think you'd need when you actually PLAY in massive stadia).<br /><br />Nevertheless, like the curate's egg, this effort is - in parts -curiously agreeable.<br /><br />While it lumbers, it does so with a Mesozoic sort of majesty: the Floyd weren't T Rex, sure, but they were a pretty regal sounding Diplodocus. And it's beautifully performed throughout (though it omits a great performance by the backing vocal troupe of The Great Gig In The Sky, which features on the video version), and Gilmour's old mate, ace rhythm guitarist Tim Renwick is given a lot of leeway to take off (especially on - ha - Learning to Fly).<br /><br />Ultimately (no surprise really) it is the guitar playing that makes this a good listen. Renwick is a really tasteful, nippy sort of guitar player - the sort from whom you'd think a Certified Guitar Legend such as Gilmour, D. might be at pains to steer clear - no-one likes a smart-arse, after all.<br /><br />So all the more credit to Gilmour for raising the bar and having Renwick on board, and letting him play. And if you listen to the album - especially the selections from A Momentary Lapse of Reason, but also the selections from the Wall and even Meddle - it is totally clear - much more so than from listening to A Momentary Lapse itself - how good, and tasteful, a guitar player David Gilmour really is.<br /><br />Especially when you compare him to the pretenders. I recently say Andy Fairweather-Low and Snowy White trying to fill Gilmour's shoes in Roger Waters' 2002 tour (Masochists: listen to Snowy and Andy in the comfort of your own home by purchasing Waters' \\"Wall - Live in Berlin\\" CD) - a truly awful experience (the concert was otherwise great, by the way). It is remarkable how the best session men money can buy just can't get anywhere near Gilmour.<br /><br />So sit back, crack a tube, and listen to David Gilmour nailing that beautiful first guitar solo from Comfortably Numb on this record.

B00005QIPH|4.0|I've had this record for quite a while now, &amp; I find that in spite of it not always being all that complex, or original, it does what it's trying to do very well. It's not the best record in my collection by a longshot, but it's certainly up there in number of times I've listened to it, which makes it one I really appreciate having.Interestingly, I really liked it at first, but it has continued to grow on me, &amp; a few of the songs with more depth (Hard to Explain, Take It Or Leave It) have really grown on me a ton. However, my friend got it &amp; hated it at first, but has grown to really love the thing, after forcing himself to listen to it a few times. (There was a course a period of 'well I guess they're okay..' in between).I recommend it. It's a very enjoyable record that will keep entertaining for a good long time.
B00005OWEG|3.0|The added scenes serve only to lengthen an already long movie.  A bit more surfing absurdity and a lengthy scene that's as much about rape as comedy (more rape, probably--and a strange--and unfunny--comedy scene)<br />Too many directors are second guessing themselves!

Well worth the money.
B0000640VO|5.0|Audrey Tautou is the shy, pixieish \\"AMELIE\\" in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's magical romantic comedy that has garnered nearly unanimous rave reviews wherever it has played.<br /><br />And yes, it really is that good.<br /><br />Gamin-like and wide-eyed, Tautou bears more than a passing resemblance to a youthful Audrey Hepburn and she is perfect in the part of a lonely waitress who accidentally discovers a small box of what must be a former tenant's childhood treasures behind a loose tile in the bathroom of her apartment in the Montmartre section of Paris. Even though the items obviously have no monetary value, she sets out to discover who hid them and return the decades old object to their rightful owner.  The strategies involved and the resulting success give her such a warm feeling she sets out to continue her acts of selfless kindness whenever the opportunity presents itself.  Along the way, she is surprised to discover that her needs and wants are being met and she has found someone to love that just might love her in return.  Naturally she plays out the game in the most charming of ways.<br /><br />Jeunet, in an interview in the supplemental material, says this story has been in his head for more than twenty years.  And it shows in the nuanced details of every shot.  The fluid cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel perfectly matches the smooth flow of the constantly surprising story with sequences carefully composed and choreographed to underscore the emotion of every scene.<br /><br />Furthermore, the entire film has been digitally tinted to match the patina hued paintings -- with splashes of red and spots of blue -- of a favorite Brazilian artist of the director.<br />In our cynical age of irony as entertainment, there's something special about experiencing a movie that reminds us of the sublime pleasure inherent in \\"treating others as we wish to be treated.\\"  Make no mistake, this is not a message film, it's not preachy and neither is it a chick flick.  But rather a deeply beautiful film that charms on such a high level that it puts in proper perspective the dreck that poses as entertainment almost everywhere we turn.<br /><br />Don't miss this marvelous film.  It will resonate in your heart and mind for a long time.ch a high level that it puts in proper perspective the dreck that poses as entertainment almost everywhere we turn.      Don't miss this marvelous film.  It will resonate in your heart and mind for a long time.
0312265859|5.0|I know that this series is not where near \\"great literature,\\" but if you want a good laugh, a little mystery, and a dash of romance, then this series is right for you.<br />In Book 8, bumbling bounty hunter Stephanie Plum is back. She's faking her way through a new case, while trying to lose weight and forget Joe Morelli at the same time.<br />Some people have said this book has a darker theme than the previous seven -- I thought all of those were equally dark (Ramirez stalking Stephanie, Kenny stabbing Grandma Mauzer in the bakery, etc.). This time, Stephanie is searching for a missing mother and daughter -- a case that at first seemed like they were trying to get away from an ex-husband, but then the body count starts rising and Stephanie knows she's in over her head ... again.<br />All of the great characters are back -- Morelli, Ranger, Lula, Grandma Mauzer, Vinnie, Connie, Stephanie's parents, sister and neices, even Bob the dog and Rex the hamster. A few favorites are missing -- Joyce Barnhardt and Mooner, but Janet Evanovich has said she'll be writing them in future novels. I guess Stephanie was too busy \\"fighting off\\" Ranger's advances to deal with arch-enemy Joyce. <br />If there was one complaint I had about this book was the fact that when Ranger and Stephanie finally got together, it was too short. My second complaint? We have to wait a year until book 9.
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather is brilliant and as such, has become one of my favorite books.
0783225857|5.0|This film is as powerful today as it was when it was first made in the sixties.A wonderful story of innocents and innocents lost. Story of strength, of race, of love, of exciting childhood times and all graced by an unforgettable movie sound track that in itself is a masterpiece.They don't make anything like this anymore and we don't have actors that can play these kinds of roles either.  This is a true CLASSIC. A piece of &quot;art&quot; that you'll enjoy over and over again and i'm sure each one of us can relate to &quot;Scout&quot; in some way.
B00005221L|5.0|A true Arnold movie, Predator delievers one hell of a great time!<BR>With cool guns and explosives, and a fairly hot girl, this is a guy movie! Wussies, please don't buy!
B000002MJC|5.0|I'm a mild Depeche Mode fan, and got started with Violator and Ultra, and I picked up a copy of SOFAD fairly [inexpensively]. It was on a cassette, and at first, I didn't care much for it. After numerous listens, it grew on me. It became my favourite album. Prior to this, I was big on Violator, but at this point, SOFAD surpasses it. I've noticed that each album covers a stage of a relationship. Violator was the early part, where everything is rosy, and the world's a sunny place. Songs of Faith and Devotion captured the time period when it's a struggle. Ultra captured the mood of a break up and the recovery period afterwards. Exciter seems to capture the mood when you've grown up, you're realistic, and you have things where you want them.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|GONE IN 60 SECONDS IS AN EXHILIRATING MOVIE. THE SUSPENSE AND ACTION COMBINE INTO MAKING THIS AN EXCELLENT FILM. IT WAS WELL PRODUCED AND CASTED. I RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ALL THE SPEED ENTHUSIASTS AND ANYBODY WHO LOVES CARS AND HIGH SPEED CHASES.
B00005O3VD|5.0|I am NOT a Barbara fan at all and i don't think of her as a nice person either but in this film she is magic! I really don't think anybody else could really play the part of Fanny except for her.  If you ever see any of Fanny Brice's movies you can see that Babs and her are very much alike to the point of being scary.I am also glad that this film has been restored to it's natural Roadshow quality which is the only reason why i bought it.  So i do recommend this DVD highly but if you read my review on \\"Hello Dolly\\" you'll notice that i wasn't kind at all. But just like Funny Girl was written for Barbara, Hello Dolly was written for Carol Channing,,,,end of story.
B000068IEU|4.0|It's hard to analyse a film like Wes Craven's 1972 horror classic 'Last House on the Left', due to different types of audiences that view movies from the genre. It is very much a 'cult' film in every sense of the word, and anyone other than horror enthusiasts and Craven fans will no doubt find little interest in this intelligent work.<br />'Last House on the Left' is a genuinely disturbing horror opus, which pulls no punches in it's representation of violence and rape, and the debasing affects of these acts. The violence is shown in a raw and dispassionate style, turning the stomach of the viewer, and is shockingly realistic. Although the violence is very much a key factor in the film, Craven's direction and morbid imagination is unforgettable, and the screenplay offers up some witty dialogue and a lot of shock value.<br />It's position in the annals of horror history is legendary, though some viewers may be turned off, due to the low-budget and crude nature of the film, and the overall feeling of dread carried throughout. It is a draining and ultimately harrowing exercise, which is distinctively hard to view. This is definitely not a movie for mainstream audiences, and is extremely different to the more popular horror ventures.<br />You'll either love this film, or absoloutely hate it.
B000056K04|5.0|Of all of the bad review of DMB I read, it's all about &quot;This is not the old DMB.  They've changed, and now I cringe.&quot;  I mean, seriously.  When DMB makes a new album people will say &quot;This is nothing like Everyday.&quot; and so on.  They just go to the previous album and compare it.  This album mixes all different sounds into one.  Isn't that what music is about?  I would recommend this album to any DMB fan, it is just what you would expect from DMB, a great album.
0316666343|5.0|I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO READ AN ADVANCE COPY OF ALICE SEBOLD'S NOVEL. IT WAS FANTASTIC. I FELT DRAWN INTO THE SALMON'S LIVES AS THEY DEALT WITH THEIR TRAGEDY. THE IMAGERY AND CHARECTOR DEVELOPMENT WAS GREAT. I COULD EASILY PICTURE, THE FIELD, THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND EVERYTHING ELSE DESCRIBED. THE CHARECTORS WERE SO RICHLY DEVOLPED.<BR>I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED IN A LONG TIME.<BR>SO GRAB THIS BOOK, CURL UP ON YOUR COUCH OR TAKE IT TO THE BEACH AND LET ALICE TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER PLACE.
0385503954|3.0|I really wanted to like this as I'm a big McEwan fan.  However, if I'm totally honest, I was a little disappointed with this, especially after all the excellent reviews.  I don't think it ever really reached the emotional intensity of a Child in Time.  Anyway, a below average McEwan is still worth the read.
B00005MP58|5.0|There are some good Jane Austen adaptations out there. But of all of them, I think this is absolutley the best of the best. I was always a big fan of the old Lawerence Olivier/Greer Garson version even though it is the wrong costumes(They used 1830's styles instead of the earlier period it should have been.)<BR>Olivier's Darcy was supperb. But after this version absolutly nothing can compare to Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Darcy and Lizzie.<BR>So well done, so extremley faithful to the book, unlike the other versions of Austen's work. Even Sense and Sensibility is not this good folks. Although it runs a close second.<BR>The new edition is also worth getting, the color, sound and widscreen version is superb. The extras are fun and I like the little featurette.<BR>A definate best buy for any Austen fan!
B00005JKCH|2.0|Ok, this is an 'ok' movie for kids.  But seriously, it's HORRIBLE!  I saw it as a 12:00 midnight showing for [less money] and im still [angry] about seeing it.  Terrible visuals!  Sam is a terrible director for several reasons.  The acting is bad, the camera work is bad, perspective of things alters, and it doesn't make any sense!  If spider-man DIDN'T jump out of the way at the end of the movie, the green goblin would be dead anyway! (I hope i'm ruining this for someone).  However, i'm not all complaints here: from this horrible, horrible script with terrible dialog, they made an 'ok' movie.  Notice how I say movie, not film...
078322947X|4.0|It's kind of neat to see so many rave reviews of this film that I was afraid was becoming forgotten. Initially, I simply knew this film to be one that scared the [heck] out of me as a kid. Later, on cable, after finally getting used to the scenes with graphic gore, I wistfully lamented that they truly don't make films like they used to. This film is echt-70's in its ruggedly authentic portrayal of working men and third-world environments. It's really too bad we don't see any of this \\"celebrated\\" in film anymore. Even the films inspired by the 70s genre of auto race and chase films make a garage look like an MTV video, as if there's only money, and no work, going into the labors. By contrast, Sorcerer is at once artistically elegant, beautifully filmed, and yet extremely true to the class of man it portrays. It is similarly impressive in portraying its third-world environments. The only drawback for me is that one of the critical action scenes (which most viewers consider outstanding) strikes me as stretching and stretching the bounds of credibility. It's intense, yes, but some shots make me think that the laws of physics had been temporarily adjusted. I wonder if the filmmakers lost a truck or two on that bridge... Another little drawback was that a minor character from early in the film needs to be recognized in order to identify how the film ends. Those who aren't strong at memorizing faces may have a problem here, but this is a minor complaint since the film is worth watching at least two times anyway so as to better place everything into the overall direction of the story, once you've identified it. What was the rule? At least 3 good scenes and no bad ones to make a great movie? The existential sequence at the end certainly qualifies. It is weird! I'm also a fan of the truck-repair sequence in the middle. Unfortunately, the key truck-driving scene later on seems to me to stretch credibility and interfere with the otherwise pervasive realism. Maybe it's not quitea great film... I couldn't say that the oil explosion and charred bodies scenes that so horrified me in my youth deserve to be called great.  Effective, anyway...<br />Definitely the kind of unique film that made 70s cinema so distinguished from the surrounding decades. Long live the decade of the everyman! And this film will definitely grow on you (or with you, as in my case!)
B00003OSTV|5.0|The previews for this movie on the VHS tape tout it as being 12 years in the making, with a cast of 30,000, and promises to be the movie spectacular of a lifetime. Well, 51 years later I'd say it's still pretty spectacular and has aged surprisingly well. I'd never seen it until now, except for bit and pieces here and there, and it's still a pretty impressive movie. The fine performances by Kerr, Ustinov, Genn, Currie, Taylor and many others still resonate, and some of the scenes, such as the burning of Rome, the Coloseum scene with the lions and Christians, still compare to anything that's been done since, and as a result, the movie has lost little of its drama, glitter, and glamour. Despite the almost 3 hours in length, the movie rarely, if ever, seems to drag or get boring. All in all, still a great movie. Big Steve says go see it and (or in this case, rent it or buy it) and don't Bogart the popcorn.
B000003S0F|5.0|I think Islands is one of the best King Crimson albums. Though i didn't appreciate it that much when i bought it, i now think it's a true masterpiece. You must listen to it while doing another thing (like working). It's the way i came to push repeat all on my cd player :). After a while, it sounds really beautiful and apeasing.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is so awesome. Its a great original cd and i encourage any1 who likes poprock with a punk twist to buy it.
B000066NW0|5.0|I really like this CD. The music is good and I relate to the lyrics. I highly suggest getting it.
B0000020C4|5.0|This cd has to be the best recording of Les Mis there is. All the cast is great, but Lea Salonga, not content with being the definitive Kim from Miss Saigon AND voicing Disney's Jasmine and Mulan for musical numbers, is 100% fan-bloody-tastic. She has a voice like crystal and hits every note perfectly. I have read some people prefering Frances Ruffelle, but in my opinion she sounds like a small child, especially in 'A Little Fall Of Rain', whereas Lea sounds like Eponine should be: a young woman.<BR>People have also accused her of sounding angry, but im sure i wouldn't be extatic to be in her position either. When people say a character 'MUST BE PLAYED LIKE THIS' they don't take into account that most actors interpret their characters differently and this is what both Frances and Lea have done.<br />In short, if you want the best version of Les Mis, buy this. If you want to have a 'fixed' Eponine, buy the Complete Symphonic or Original London Cast album instead.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This record represents yet another side of the greatest experimental band in the U.S. Fusing electronica, the screaming of a \\"crazy Japanese woman,\\" and that unmistakable barely-in-key singing, Yoshimi is not the Soft Bulletin all over again, nor is it a throwback to the noise-scapes of Zaireeka. Though none of those things would be unwelcome, the Lips are inventors and not content to stick with the same orchestrations.<br />The trademark deceptive simplicity (and beauty) of Lips' melodies remains, especially in the stirring single \\"Do You Realise??\\" and \\"In the Morning of the Magicians.\\" During my first listen, I was slightly disappointed in the electronic bent of the album, but it has already grown on me. I find all the best albums in my collection were ones I first had issues with and later discovered to be full of welcome surprises. Don't be put off by the less-acoustic nature of this effort.<br />The Lips realise that the instrumentation and feel of a song must be congruent with its meaning or story. Here the electronic adventuring seems well suited to a story about robots bent on human destruction. And as I'm sure we all guessed, our savior from these machines will undoubtedly be a crazy Japanese lady. <br />Don't get bogged down in comparisons between this and the Lips' last effort. For those of us who are more acoustically inclined and tend to distrust electronic artists (due to the fact that pressing buttons does seem to require a bit less talent than manipulating actual instruments), Yoshimi will be a departure. But like Radiohead, the Lips know how to make something interesting out of whatever they touch. Wayne Coyne could create a symphony out with some tweezers and a Glad trash bag if they wanted to. And I would still lay down fifteen bucks to buy it.<br />So don't fear -- it's the same band. A band that changes (thankfully) and grows with each release. The true mark of maturity. Dive into Yoshimi just as you've dove into every other Flaming Lips album.And if you're one who's gone to the trouble of buying three more stereos just so you can get the full effect of Zaireeka, some dabbling in the land of electronica shouldn't be too painful. Give it a few days and it'll make its way into your brain.
B00005YU1O|5.0|The main objections that people have to this movie are two-fold:<BR>1) the dialogue is pretentious.<BR>2) the dialogue is boring.<br />I will attempt to explain why they think that:<br />First off, the dialogue snippets are INDEED accurate.  Linklater went through great pains to not only get ACCURACY, but more importantly, BREVITY so that a WIDE SCOPE OF IDEAS could be crammed into ONE MOVIE. That means only a FEW MINUTES for each  POINT OF VIEW.<br />Just think about the ENORMOUS task of breaking down Sartre's 900 Page, Nobel Prize winning masterpiece down to a 12 minute monologue - trying to retain the BREADTH of his meaning, and without giving a bastardized representation. That means that some fancy words and dialogue have to be ASSUMED on the audience's part [SORRY, no time to explain EVERYTHING - we've only got a few minutes of airtime], and that's where the PRETENTIOUSNESS comes from. that's what people are COMPLAINING ABOUT, since they DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT - it all went TOO FAST. Well here's the thing: it's not possible for most of us to understand it.<br />Unless you've read the text before watching the movie, and 95% of us haven't, you're not going to know what's going on.  It is DIFFICULT ENOUGH to understand Sartre in an entire SEMESTER of lectures, let alone to make full sense of it in a cartoon movie. <br />Still, I think Linklater did an excellent job considering the obstacles against him. The portion that he tried to show was a great choice: people misunderstand existentialism to be about DEPRESSION AND HOPELESSNESS.  Sartre did not want that. He said that **WE** must TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for our own actions, up to US to make our own lives better. <br />Your answers to life are NOT in this movie. But what you will find is the affirmation that you are NOT ALONE when you have these thoughts about life. Because we don't discuss these things at work, or talk to our family and friends too often about it, doesn't mean that they aren't important to us. Theseare the thoughts that are in the periphery of our minds in passing moments, or the ones that keep us awake at night when we're alone - but we aren't alone. Other people out there THINK TOO.<br />DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE IF:<BR>1) if you're not constantly questioning the purpose of life, or if you think you've got it all figured out.  <BR>2) if you think that PRETENTIOUSNESS people are the ones that talk about things that YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND... <br />Because the truth of the matter is... if you truly KNOW something about these people, then you will LOVE this movie. anyone can easily REVERSE NAMEDROP [dropping names to give the FALSE impression that they're knowledgeable, only to DISMISS THEM]. The concepts of some of these thinkers are very hard to grasp and it's EASIER for people to just call them boring or pretentious. Just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean it's GOOD, but it CERTAINLY doesn't mean it's BAD either. <BR>Most of you who didn't like it, i'm afraid have missed the point [Just take a look at your horrendous spelling skills as one rubric of intelligence].
B000068PQ0|5.0|As a general rule, each Flaming Lips album has been exponentially better than the last. After the unbelievable Soft Bulletin, I didn't think it was possible for music to get any better. Somehow, the Flaming Lips pulled it off. Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is the best thing I've ever heard. It completely trounces every other piece of music, ever.
B00003CXI1|2.0|This was a good movie in general.  However, I have to disagree with people who thought that it stayed pretty true to the book.  It did in some parts, but I felt that it changed or left out stuff that would have been just as easy to leave in.  Such as, Professor Snape's potions charm that is an obstacle to the Sorcerer's Stone was left out.  Also, in that same scene Harry not playing the flute that Hagrid gave him to soothe Fluffy.  On that thought, the role of Hagrid was terrible!  They made him seem so stupid.  I hope that the next movie stays truer to the book.
0316666343|5.0|What a wonderful novel to begin a career.  This was an absolute pleasure to read and unlike anything I've read before.  You can't help but think that all those who have left this earth are watching over from thier own version of heaven.
B0000033J9|5.0|The legendary Jarre composed this in only six weeks!<br />The theme which is so recognizable and varied throughout this soundtrack, was his fourth attempt!  The director rejected his first three. Told him, forget about Russia. Go to the mountains with your girlfriend, write a love song that will be universal!  What an outcome!<br />Story opens with the inheritance of the balalaika.  Common thread.  How found sixteen players and how they interfaced with the orchestra.  Influenced by a balalaika orchestra in Russia.<br />This and more in the outstanding notes with this special edition.<br />Favorites are the Russian influenced waltzes, and of course variations of Lara's theme.<br />As the mood of the film changes, so does the soundtrack. With its Bolshevic chants, and marches, and down sounds.  How this wonderful score enhances and makes this film's images so vivid and alive in one's mind only by hearing the theme's few notes.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Get your favorite friend, put this CD on, turn it up and make brunch. This is just fun. Lighten up and enjoy it!
0307120007|2.0|Compared to Eric Carle, Rebecca Emberley and Dr. Seuss, I think this book is a little overrated. The illustrations are dated and don't hold my son's attention at all. I bought this because it had a good reputation, but I'm disappointed.
0316666343|5.0|I normally do not read this style of book, I stay with books like The Price of Immortality and WOT series but my wife had bought it and insisted that I read it. This is a story of a murdered teenage girl and her observations of what happens with her family on earth after her murder tell the story. It's incredibly moving, don't tell anyone but I found myself tearing up often throughout the book.  This is one of those books that stays with you long after you have finished reading it, but in a good way, not in a sad one. It also made me laugh, strange as that may sound. All the characters are very real, and you begin to love them as Susie does. I'm highly impressed by Alice Sebold's storytelling, and I look forward to reading anything else she may write.<BR>A different kind of story but very very good is The Price of Immortality. I highly recommend it!
0385335482|4.0|This is the kind of book a girl like me can relate to, if your a shop-a-holic you'll love this book! It's about a girl that loves shopping but can't keep up with the bills. She decides to cut back--that doesnt work, then tries making more money--again does not work. But in the end its a hollywood ending!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I first saw this movie at the theaters, I(23 then) went with my dad(59 then) to see it, our first intention wasn't see Shrek, we were looking for something else, but find nothing better to watch than Shrek, well, we both loved it, that gives you and idea of how good this movie is, it has no age-range, now I own this DVD (R4 $uck$! it only comes with 1 DVD), I have to say, it was great that they put a Spanish audio track on both DVD's, as well as subtitles in Spanish, This is a great DVD and the Extras add a lot more value to this, you have to hear the commentary track, it's great. Anyway, get this DVD soon, it's a must have for all family.
0736041850|5.0|I don't write reviews, ever.  However, this is by far one of the handiest books I've ever purchased, and I'd highly recommend it.  The diagrams are interesting, accurate, color-coded, and just professional overall.  Both my wife and I use this as a reference whenever there is a quesiton.  You don't even have to be hardcore to appreciate all the book has to offer.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Without being a so called \\"Special Edition\\", this DVD is way much better than a few SE I own, 1st: you get a great movie, with great audio and subtitles even in spanish!!....2nd: A whole lot of extras, included a second DVD, 3rd: a great nice packaging, OK this doesn't help much to improve the experience, but it's a great package, the moment you check it you'll know I'm right!<br />Get it Now! Run Forrest run & get a copy today! This is the 2 DVD's version.
B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax's 1987 album \\"Among the Living\\" is nothing short of incredible. It seems Anthrax was just warming their hands and their sound on \\"Spreading the Diease\\". If you can get past the super fast drums and the crushing guitar riffs you will get to the harshness and realism of Scott Ian's lyrics. From writing about Native Americans or their comic book hero Judge Dredd, they are great. With Anthrax classics including \\"Indians\\", \\"Imitation of Life\\", and the title track. Ths album also holds Anthrax's greatest live song very appropriatly titled \\"Caught in a Mosh\\". This album is up there w/ Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" and Metallcia's \\"Master of Puppets\\" as the best thrash metal album ever.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I really wanted to leave the theater and ask for my money backseveral times.  The wife didn't want to, though.  When it was all over she said she wished she had.  The short story is interesting -- if if had been a 30 or 40 minute movie it would have been great.  But instead it was plodding and idiotic.  Don't be so darn smitten next time Stevey...
B000001FFR|5.0|Anthrax's 1985 release \\"Spreding the Diease\\" is not their best work, but it isn't far from it. This is Anthrax's first release on a major record label, Island Records. This is right after they went through their first major lineup change after dropping vocalist Neil Turbin for Joey Belladonna and  dropping bassist and co-founder of Anthrax Danny Liker for current bassist Frank Bello. This album holds some Anthrax's classics including \\"A.I.R.\\", \\"Armed and Dangerous\\", \\"Medusa\\", and \\"S.S.C./Stand or Fall\\". This also has Anthrax's first hit single and metal classic, \\"Madhouse\\". This is one of the albums along w/ Metallica's \\"Kill'em All\\" and Slayer's \\"Show No Mercy\\" that made thrash metal alive and Anthrax one of the pioneers of speed metal.
B00005JG6Q|3.0|Well, this one was well thought out and planned.  And don't get me wrong, I am very pleased with the movie and am proud to have purchased it.  It's just the reason I give this movie 3 stars is because there were many unanswered question, and some things that could've been left out.<br />My question is:  Where on earth did all those kids go?  I know some hard core annime fans have their deadset opinions however I still don't quite get the idea.  All I know is that they went away and disapeared.  Is that all?  You know, that sets it up perfectly for a sequel, if there is any Tokoyo left to destroy that is, they certainly banged it up pretty good.<br />I'm also still confused on who started the nuclear war.  Most people point their fingers towards Akira however I really wonder about that.<br />And the stuff that could be left out is simple.  The language could've been better.  I'm not a goody two shoes however I expect a little bit of cleanliness in movies.  And the last thing was the scene where the bikers tore that girl's shirt off.  Not needed at all.  I'm glad they took that out in the director's cut.  Sexuality is never needed in a movie unless the circumstances have to permit it.<br />Overall, a great movie worth purchasing if you love annime.
B00003CXTG|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theaters with my grandmother.  She was stationed in Hawaii as military nurse when Pearl Harbor was bombed, so this movie has more than just historical value, it has personal value.<br />The movie recounts the events of Pearl Harbor through the lives of three people, two best friends that are pilots, and one nurse, who they are both in love with.<br />At times the movie is a bit slow, and the love story a little tedious, but it does not distract too much from the overall film.  The action sequences are amazing, with fresh perspectives not seen in any other film in recent memory.<br />You'll feel American pride at the end of the film, especially with recent events.  If you want to get a dose of what it would have been like to be in Pearl Harbor at the time of the raids, then get this movie, sit down, and don't expect to take your eyes away for the next three hours.<br />This is a great film that I highly reccomend.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was one of the first annimes I bought.  This movie was highly recomended and I see why.  The mixture or combat sequences, crystal clear annimation and the excellent music composition made this an excellent movie.<br />I watched this with my parents (who hate annime) and they ended up loving it.  They also loved the music and beautiful annimation.<br />I loved the way they introduced the shoulder-mounted riffles.  I thought that was amusing when the sword-happy samarais tried to take on the rifflemen.  I'm a big fan of riffles so I love it when they have swordsman square off against rifflemen.<br />The overall aspect of annimation was top notch.  Well done annimation and I loved the forest background.  Even my parents were impressed with that.<br />The character developement was great.  They explained everything without boring you to death.  Some annimes I've seen have put me to sleep while they explain everything.  I though the lady's bodyguard with the oversized 'bent' sword was hilarious.  He always got the short end of the stick.<br />But my favorite part was the music.  I loved it, I bought the soundtrack and I play it all the time.  It mixes perfectly with the story and plot.  I can see why this movie made it in theatres.<br />Overall, worth buying not matter what movies you like.  I recomend watching even if you don't like annime.  If my redneck parents can enjoy it, so can you.
B00003CXWV|5.0|With the recent loss of the maker of this film, Ted Demme, I believe you owe it to the guy to see this film.  Not only as a tribute to the guy, but also cause this film is amazing!<br />Based on a true story, it shows the eventual decline of Johnny Depps character into the sinister world of drug trafficking.  What started as an easy way to make some cash, leads Depp into becoming the cocaine baron of America.<br />With a rocking soundtrack, great perforamances from Depp and Penelope Cruz, this is truly a fantastic film.
B000002HAF|4.0|Many people seem to prefer Doolittle, but, in my opinion, this is the best bang for your Pixies buck. Their sound was simply revolutionary at the time Surfer Rosa was released, and even fifteen years later still sounds very fresh and innovative, despite the many bands who unsuccessfully attempted to imitate them. It's sort of a cross between hardcore and psychedelia, with blaring guitars, strident drums, and crazed, trippy lyrics. If you are into indie rock at all, well, then you probably already own this. If you don't, then you owe it to yourself to hear the roots of modern rock.
B000066AXE|5.0|I don't want to give too much away about the film, but I want everyone to know that this is a fantastic story.  Ron Howard has made a masterpiece.  Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connely are equally amazing.<br />If you liked heartfelt story of &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; then you will really enjoy this film as well.  Russel Crowe plays a student with an unparalleled gift for mathematics.  The story follows about 50 years of his life, and covers many tribulations, pains, and joy that he faced.<br />The film is based on the true life story of John Nash, and it does so in a very engaging way.  I highly reccomend this film.
B000066NW0|5.0|Well, as I write this review I have the Avril Lavinge CD popped into my computer and listening to it. It is one of the few CDs people find that they can listen to straight through thirty times without screaming &quot;Shut that freakin' pop princess up!&quot; Clearly different from that of Britney Spears, she's a Sk8er punk rather then the &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot; school girl.. particually with the line &quot;Take Off All Your Preppy Clothes&quot; (Complicated). I often find people (including my parents **shutters**) singing the lyrics to Sk8er Boi, or the MTV hit, Complicated. I highly suggest this CD to anyone.
B00003CX5P|4.0|If you are a Star Wars fan, then you know that this is the first Star Wars movie to be released on DVD, which is a big deal.<br />The movie is just ok, George Lucas seems to be a little bit rusty after a long hiatus of adding to the Star Wars universe.  This is the first Star Wars movie, and introduces many of the character that millions have come to know and love such as C3-PO and R2-D2.<br />The film follows the early childhood of Anakin Skywalker, the soon to be Darth Vader that we see in the original three films.  The story moves along at a medium pace and includes all the usually Lucas fanfare of special effects and aliens.  The pod racing scene is especially memorable.<br />For anyone that liked the original Star Wars films than this movie will be enjoyable.  It's key in understanding much of the Star Wars universe.  A good film to say the least!
0066620996|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the best business books written. Most books about success or the elements of effective business are based on someone's opinion - a business school PhD, a successful (or perhaps not so) CEO, or some other guru writes about his personal views of what makes a successful business.<br />Collins' much more powerful approach was to use quantitative data to identify truly successful companies, then analyze them with a team of students to identify their common characteristics. Not only is the approach sound, the results are absolutely inspiring. The team's findings about the importance of good leadership, of choosing the right people, of staying focused on a simple message, resonate deeply. I'm not the most experienced businessperson in the world, but everything I've seen of American business (and government) enterprises suggests Collins is dead on. Adoption of the principles he's recognized will create successful companies--and, as importantly, terrific employers.<br />This is a must-read.
B00005JKDR|5.0|In the style of \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"A Bugs Life\\", this is Disney's fourth fully computer generated film...and it's incredible.<br />The story is extremely creative.  The world of Monsters runs on a special fuel, the screams of children (this might sound sick and scary, but it's really quite cute), but, the children aren't getting as scared as they used to, and the Monster City is having blackouts.  Thus, we find ourselves at the scream factory.  When one of the little kids gets into the Monster world, then pandemonium ensues.<br />A very nice film that shows the extreme creativity within the Disney studios, this will soon be a family favorite.  I highly reccomend this movie!
B00005Q66T|5.0|Madonna has said she wanted to put a compilation together that contained songs she could still listen to repeatedly without getting sick of them. At the same time, this compilation was also designed as a companion to her last two hits compilations, &quot;Something To Remember&quot; and &quot;The Immaculate Collection.&quot; Point blank--if you are looking for her hits &quot;Rain,&quot; &quot;You'll See,&quot; &quot;I'll Remember,&quot; &quot;This Used To Be My Playground,&quot; and &quot;I Want You,&quot; buy &quot;Something To Remember.&quot; That was what that compilation was designed for!<br />As per the music, I must say I agree with Madonna on all levels. &quot;Music,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; &quot;Secret,&quot; and &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; have certainly stood the test of time in terms of her upbeat classics. &quot;The Power Of Good-bye&quot; still brings chills down my spine, and &quot;Frozen&quot; is as haunting as ever. A welcome addition to her catalog.
B00003CY0V|4.0|This movie has guns, bombs, hacking, bank heists, helicopters, and a great beat.<br />Hugh Jackman (Wolverine from \\"X-Men\\") plays a retired computer hacker who is brought back into the business of computer fraud because John Travolta knows that he's the best of the best. Hugh accepts because he needs the money in order to get custody of his daughter, currently under the protection of his ex-wife.  From there Jackman finds himself back in the cutthroat underworld of crime.  Travolta stars as a the bad guy crime boss in this movie, with Halle Berry as his right hand woman.  Very interesting roles for each of the actors/actresses involved.<br />With a great soundtrack by electronic god Paul Oakenfold, this film makes a great techno thriller, along the lines of \\"the Saint\\" and any of the Bond flicks.<br />I highly reccomend this film.
076781326X|3.0|this was a pretty good musical version of oliver twist mark lester was great. I espically like jack wild and ron moody as dodger and fagin after seeing this you bound to be hum the songs all night. if you have to read the novel for a class and want to cheat by wacthing a movie dont use this version.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Finally, the trend in hollywood has moved towards brain twisting clever thrillers.<br />I've never seen a movie like this before.  Guy Pearce plays a man who is trying to uncover his past.  He has lost the ability to create new memories (Anterograde Amnesia) due to something in his past.  Thus, each day he wakes up he has to relearn the fact that he can't make these new long term memories.  He has the ability to make short term memories, but his &quot;slate&quot; is wiped clean about every 20 minutes.  The movie is a series of events played in revere order, so after the current scene is over, the scene that occured chronologically prior to it is then played.  It's really something that you have to see to experience, but is done flawlessly.<br />I highly reccomend this movie, there is nothing like it available today!
B000067CPX|4.0|. . .I like this album.  By the Way seems to be a collection of similar songs--often the same chord progressions and minor keys--but each song maintains a separate thought organized separately.  I sincerely appreciate the production on this album and I describe it as my Album of Summer 2002.  Californication remains a genius album giving way to this decent follow-up.  I appreciate this album also because the songs display lyrical, deep and not overly punky and obnoxious proof of RCHP's musicality.  When compared to my normal listening collection of Faithless, Everything But the Girl and other electronic music, RCHPeppers hold my interest.  Nice.

B000002KNY|5.0|It's pretty condescending to claim that this recording is not for Talking Heads &quot;beginners&quot;.  Byrne and company made this music for everyone and it should be enjoyed as so.  I encourage those of you not familiar with the Heads to pick this one up, it is the epitome of their sound and contains some unmatched moments.  This should be the first Talking Heads album anyone should own.
6305508550|5.0|Everything I see/do/hear at work reminds me of this movie.  Not since Seinfeld has a comedy been so true to life.<br />A much overlooked comedy, this is easily one of my top five movies of all time.  Every time I watch this movie it cracks me up more and more.  I find something new with every viewing, such as someones particular body language, or just a little comment.  Plus, it's a very quotable movie, with lines like &quot;Did you get the memo?&quot; and &quot;O-face&quot; that my friends and I still use to this day.<br />If you are a cubicle jockey like the rest of us, then you will laugh out loud during this movie...the film just hits the bulls-eye every time.  I highly reccomend this movie!
B00004Z459|5.0|Basically, I bought this CD out of pure curiosity and I needed a new CD.   I had heard a few songs and I thought it would be worth getting.  That was a year ago and I still have it in my CD player.  Likin Park is an excellent band that has a new spin on alternative.  Its loud and catchy but it isnt obscene and satanic.  Linkin Park has had many singles of this one CD (one step closer, crawling, and in the end released in that order getting better and better each time) and there are still other great songs on this CD.  Usually I buy a CD and like 3 or 4 songs out of 12.  However I love all the songs on this CD and I constantly play it.  BOTTOM LINE- Try this CD out, you wont be disappointed

0790729652|5.0|Michael Keaton is the ultimate Bruce Wayne in this Gothic, Tim Burton styled retelling of the Dark Knight's first introduction to his Arch-Nemesis, The Joker. Jack Nicholson plays the Clown Prince of Crime in this 1989 example of filmmaking perfection, and he truly makes the role his own.<br />If you don't know the character already, Batman is a superhero unlike most others. He has no superpowers, he is simply a man born into privilege, whose parents were taken away from him when he was a boy in a dark alley by a common thief (who later became the Joker). As young Bruce Wayne grew up, he vowed to use his money and power to fight crime, so he perfected any and all skills he deemed helpful. He became the world's greatest detective, a master escape artists, learned martial arts and pretty much anything and everything that could help a man fight crime without the use of deadly weapons. With his wealth he armored himself with vehicles, an assortment of high tech gadgets, and a special suit that hid his identity while also giving him the imposing appearance of some sort of half man-half bat creature. The idea of the costume being to strike fear into the hearts of evil doers in order to intimidate them and make them easier to capture.<br />The film begins with a classic \\"day in the life\\" scene, where a couple and their son walk through a dark alley in Gotham city and are straight away mugged, with Batman winging in to nab the villains. Here we are introduced to a Batman unlike any we have seen on screen before: Dark, brooding, and even scary in a way, just as he should be. But in other parts of Gotham City, Evil is in full control. Crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance, is this great casting or what?!), has most of the cops in his back pocket. Though Batman is new on the scene and the cops still don't know what to make of him, he truly is the only help Commissioner Gordon has in battling the mob. Grissom's lead man is a loose cannon named Jack Napier, who thinks Grissom is unaware of his secret meetings with Grissom's gal. One fateful night, Grissom's setup to land Jack in an early grave goes awry, when Batman interferes. When Napier falls into a vat of chemicals he comes out with a white complexion, green hair, and a permanent smile on his face, not to mention he`s even crazier than before. With a newfound confidence and a taste for revenge, Jack, now calling himself The Joker, kills boss Grissom and takes over the mob that runs Gotham. But Joker is more of a psychopath than a crime boss. His big plans for Gotham include mass murder.<br />  During this changing of the guards, Bruce Wayne, AKA Batman, is preoccupied with a pretty photojournalist he's just met, Vicki Vale, who coincidentally is working on a story about the Batman. Her partner, Knox, tries his best to keep her mind off romance and on their story, but there's something about Bruce Wayne that has her fascinated. And there's something about Vicki Vale that quickly catches the Joker's eye. Before we know it, Batman's battle with the Joker includes constantly coming to Vicki's rescue, but an even bigger problem is unfolding. Joker is poisoning the people of Gotham city through a mix of cleverly hidden chemicals in common beauty and hygiene products. When Batman finally deciphers THAT riddle, a new danger comes up. For the city's 200th birthday celebration, Joker sets up a parade from which he promises to shower the crowd with millions of dollars in cash. He keeps his promise, but as the citizens scramble to collect the loot, his giant balloons begin to release poisonous gas over the city. Now Batman must find a way to save the citizens of Gotham, including his new love Vicki, and confront the Joker one last time.<br />  Sadly, this DVD has little to offer outside of the actual movie, but at least you can choose from full-screen and widescreen, a feature I always enjoy having, even if I always seem to choose widescreen nowadays. As for the movie itself, Batman ranks up at the top of those ultimate comic book movies, alongside Spider-Man, Superman, X-Men, and Dick Tracy, among a few others. Aside from the animated Batman, there has never been a Batman this good, maybe there never will be again. The cast is top notch, and this is definitely one of Tim Burton's best, up there with Sleepy Hollow.

0792843584|2.0|When I read the intial reviews of this film, I knew that it was not going to last long in the theatres so I rushed out to see it, fearing that it would be yanked and disappear forever. I was right, as it left my local theatre the next week and most national movie chains the week after. I was the only one in the theatre! What I saw was the movie on a big screen. Here is what I thought: It was a gorgeously filmed, beautifully scored mess with a few striking set pieces (the roller skating scene, etc.). It was almost impossible to figure out. I still have little idea what the early scenes in harvard have to do with the rest of the film or why the prostitute (idealized by Hollywood, as usual) had such a large, meaningless role. I also have no idea why the peasants were shot. The movie either doesn't explain these things or does so in such vague ways that you will miss them. Much of the dialogue was unintelligible! The dialogue soundtrack was muddy and the acting appeared to be drug influenced (later stories about the filming stated that drug use was widespread on the set). If you have nothing better to do, you might get a kick out this for the big scenes but have your fast forward button close by, you will need it. A bewildering, sometimes stunning, often tedious film.
B00000K501|5.0|I love Rammstein. and I was glad to see them in concert since they never perform anywhere near me.
B000002OX3|4.0|It's ironic, I think, that the Who's second LP had no standout hit tune, didn't do too well in the States, and doesn't have the kind of legendary status attributed to some of their later LPs, but may be the most influential of all Who records.<br />The mix of R&amp;B instrumentation and pseudo-Beach-Boys harmonies popularized on this LP (and a whole series of Kinks records) still makes regular appearances on the UK and USA charts, &quot;A Quick One&quot; formalized the free-form style Cream, Hendrix and 10,000 lesser talents wore out in concerts during the late 1960s and 70s, and Paul Weller has spent his entire career trying to recreate the controlled mayhem of this LP.<br />Sounds like a bad graduate thesis, don't it?<br />When this record hit the popular conciousness of my highschool we wore it out in a year-long series of, shall we say, stimulating late night parties.  It was the &quot;throw away&quot; stuff that really got us going: &quot;Run Run Run,&quot; &quot;Batman,&quot; and, of course, &quot;Bucket T.&quot;<br />So there are no big whompin' &quot;My Generation&quot; type hit-anthems.  But how can you resist a record where Pete Townshend announces &quot;we have a remedy little girl--I'm gonna make you feel alright,&quot; followed by Keith Moon's dead-on tom-tom and splash cymbol imitation of a steam engine?<br />A QUICK ONE is a bit sloppy, but it's more of a fun 'party' record than anything else the Who ever did.  I'll never set it on a pedastal with QUADREPHENIA or WHO'S NEXT, but it's still a very good record.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Order this now!!!...What a fun, crazy, original, funny, touching and rockin' movie.  I have such a huge crush on Hedwig mainly because of his huge heart.  This will remain on my midnight movie list forever.  (Having said that, I didn't like the last 10 minutes of the film.  It could have been cut.)  But so what, the rest of this wild rock and roll ride will have you head banging and lanughing out loud.  Order the soundtrack too.  Long live Hedwig!!!...
B00003CXQY|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie since it seemed to have disappeared without much hype from the theaters. I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to find that this is one of those Disney movies that not only appeals both to kids but to adults as well. In fact, it compares very favorably to both Shrek and Aladdin in this regard. The movie is perfectly cast, with Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld and the Tick) as Kronk, a big oaf sidekick who hums his own theme music and talks &quot;squeakety-squeak&quot; language to squirrels. Most amusing.<br />I bought the collector's edition, and while there are plenty of extras included on the second DVD, I'm not entirely sure that they're worthwhile over the regular DVD release. Of the 3 deleted scenes, only one is animated - the other two are mainly storyboard composites with audio tracks from stand-in voice artists. If you're like me and jump all over deleted scenes, you'll probably be disappointed here.
B000002UDB|4.0|While it is obvious that this is not the best Beatles album, it is a good album nonetheless. With greats like Revolver, the White Album, Abbey Road, Sgt. Peppers,etc.., Magical Mystery Tour is not the Beatles album to start with. But, it is a must have for Beatles fans and completists and an eventual purchase for those in the younger set who are just exploring the Beatles catalogue for the first time. So what if it seems like a collection of singles, most Beatles songs are great and there are some great one's here too (such as MMT, Fool on the Hill,Your Mother should know, I am the walrus, Hello goodbye, Strawberry fields forever, Penny lane, Baby you're a rich man, and all you need is love). Having listed those songs, the only two that don't make it on the list of great songs (but only good songs) are Flying and Blue Jay Way. Typical Beatles, even their fluff is damn good. We won't see another group like them.... Take comfort in the Beatles.
0553381709|4.0|I'm not a huge fantasy novel fan. Dragons, magic(k) and people with goofy Welsh-sounding names with lots of c's, l's and y's turn me off. So it was a most pleasant surprise when I found that this series does away with the usual fantasy-type stuff and concentrates instead on a firm plot with a direction, characters with depth and realistic motivation and the like.<br />Martin's stewardship of the series so far seems to indicate that he's got a destination in mind and actually means to get there, which is more than can be said for the currently-rudderless Wheel of Time epics. This third book in the series shows us that there's plenty of surprises to go around. Hopefully I'll be saying that by the time the last book (6th or 7th) rolls around.<br />My complaints with this entry are minor: we're &quot;treated&quot; to more than a few songs this time around - there must be more in this novel than the prior two combined. In a way this strikes me as an unusual change of pace; one can't help but wonder if someone commented to the author that Tolkien had songs in his works and thus Martin needed to follow that path as well. Still, they don't really detract from the story.
B000002KYR|4.0|ZZ Top's sudden MTV omnipresence and massive popularity that followed the 1983 release of &quot;Eliminator&quot; may have jarred long time fans of the little ol' band from Texas, but the truth is that the album is also one of their best.  The hits may have been inescapble on video and the radio at the time, but &quot;Gimmie All Your Lovin',&quot; &quot;Sharp Dressed Man&quot; and &quot;Legs&quot; are perfect pop rock gems that still hold up two decades later.  Other standout cuts are the harder rocking &quot;Got Me Under Pressure,&quot; another MTV goof &quot;TV Dinners,&quot; and one of their better slower songs in &quot;I Need You Tonight.&quot;  The rest is certainly filler material, but holds up well enough.<br />Overall, a huge commercial and artistic success that marked the high point of the Top's long career.
0553278398|5.0|Having enjoyed the original Foundation trilogy and the two follow-up books, I was reluctant about Asimov's telling of Hari Seldon's life. It didn't really seem interestin to me, and if it was interesting, I was leery of peeking at the magic behind the curtain, as it were.<br />What I found instead was an excellent character study. I've read elsewhere that the character of Seldon is in many ways autobiographical of Asimov himself, and that's not hard to believe. Seldon often comes across in the novel as Asimov himself does - driven and humorously self-effacing. In this way, Seldon himself is perhaps the most clearly fleshed out of all the characters Asimov has written about. When combined with the surprising (at least to me) plot points of Hari's life, you're left with a whole new spin on the series itself.<br />In short, strongly recommended.
B000002KKK|4.0|\\"Deguello\\" is the one 1970's era ZZ Top album left off their \\"Six Pack\\" collection of early material.  For shame, since it is also one of the band's best albums.  In addition to two long time Top favorites, \\"Cheap Sunglasses,\\" and \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide,\\" the album contains an absolutely ace cover of the 60's staple \\"I Thank You.\\"  Other standout album tracks include \\"She Loves My Automobile\\" and \\"Fool for Your Stockings.\\"  The rest of the material holds up as better than your average filler.  \\"Deguello\\" is also the album that marks the establishment of the \\"modern\\" ZZ Top sound (more rocking, less bluesy) that would pay off a few years later with their mega-successful MTV smash \\"Eliminator.\\"<br />Overall, one of the best original studio albums from the little ol' band from Texas.
0671004107|4.0|One of Carl Sagan's great interests was advanced alien civilizations and the possibility of contact with them. What I think he really wanted to do in this novel is convey some of the sense of wonder and even awe that we would experience if we did manage to contact someone. And he does this very well.  But one aspect of the novel that I found a bit tedious was the romance between the lead characters Ellie and Palmer Joss.  They just seemed to be such an unlikely match - she, a highly professional, intelligent intellectual, and he, a fundamentalist Christian.  I understand that Sagan needed some dramatic tensions to help flesh-out the novel but it went on too long and strained my credulity.  Likewise I was unimpressed with the ending where he has the aliens investigating the discovery of a hidden message in Pi - implying an intelligent designer/s of some sort. Whether this reflects his true beliefs or not I don't know but I hope it wasn't just an attempt to appeal to religious readers.  Anyway, it was a great read, and I also like the movie with Jodie Foster playing the lead role.  I'm very sad of course that there'll never be a sequel now.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Regardless of which version you see, \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" is a brilliantly flawed piece of filmaking that has more power than anything released in Hollowood the last decade or so (\\"Saving Private Ryan\\" being the only possible exception).  The performances by Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall are among the best of their careers while Marlon Brando's weird entry into the film's last half hour are contrversial and unlike anything seen before or since.  Not to mention the fact that many of the images are simply unforgettable.<br />That siad, the \\"Redux\\" version both adds to and detracts from the movie itself.  The additional footage is going to be of most interest to big fans of the film (like me).  Unfortunately, they mostly serve to slow the story down while making it even more surrealistic.  Never meant to be taken as a literal account of the real life fighting experience of the Vietnam War, the added footage makes the movie even more of a nightmare and even less authentic as an actual war movie.<br />That said, ...
B00004U8H4|5.0|I'm a Balehead, I admit it, so I will always get Christian's movies, but this one has to be taken with a grain of salt. Is it meant to be horror? I think not, it's pure comedy. I laughed my a** off. Christian did an amazing job, as in every other movie he's ever done, and I had to skip back so I could hear my favorite lines again. I love his toilette scene, he's worse than any woman in the world. I loved his bluntness, his honesty. No matter how sick he is, you want to be a part of him because everyone has that little thing in them that wants to tell people exactly what they think or feel. I understand that people who have read the book want it to be truer to it, but as anyone knows very few movies follow the books exactly, how do you think Stephen King feels about his stuff? If you are a Balehead, of course this will have to be a part of your collection, but I think even if I wasn't one I would find this movie hilarious, disturbing yes, but I found Monster's Ball much more disturbing and it won awards?
B00003CXZ4|5.0|\\"Memento\\" is the ultimate movie lovers flick.  It incorporates the best aspects of classic film noir (circa early 1950s) and turns it on its head with the clever trick of presenting the narrative in reverse.  The movie starts out at the end, with brain damaged Lenny taking revenge by killing the man who raped and killed his wife and who left him brain damaged.  But did he get the right guy?  As the film progresses, it becomes more and more unclear.  When the truth is revealed, the \\"ending\\" takes on a whole new meaning.<br />Guy Pearce, the \\"other\\" Australian actor in \\"L.A. Confidential\\" emerges from Russell Crowe's shadow with an outstanding performance as the tormented Lenny.  Backing him up are fine efforts \\"Matrix\\" vets Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss, who are Lenny's main antagonists.<br />Well scripted, well acted, and challengely put togather, \\"Memento\\" was the best American movie of 2001.
B00005RHGK|5.0|In my opinion, I thought this movie was an excellent edge of your seat thiller. Trish(Gina Philips) and Darry(Justin Long) are on their way home for Spring Break. When an old brown truck(BEATNGU) nearly runs them off the deserted country road. Later, they find &quot;BEATNGU&quot; dumping something in a sheet down a pipe. Of course, Darry, being the younger brother, doesn't listen to Trish. The pare end up on the scariest adventure of their lives.<br />Justin Long and Gina Philips both give outstanding performances and Jonathan Breck is wonderful as &quot;The Creeper&quot;. Victor Salva(writer and director) had a good plot and he really went with it. This was on of the best movies I've seen in years. I can't wait for Like a Bat Out of Hell: Jeepers Creepers 2 comes out!
B000001DV2|4.0|To me, this album as a whole sounds like the softer half of Hysteria, which is certainly not bad at all.  The thing is, there is very little that is heavier than the lead track and first single from the album, the catchy, tongue-in-cheek &quot;Let's Get Rocked&quot;.  This is a very fun song for sure but not very heavy.  While nice pop rockers like &quot;Heaven Is&quot; and &quot;Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion)&quot; are sprinkled throughout, the true hard rock rarely hits.  Even the one song that I would call an &quot;anthem&quot;, the tribute to Steve Clark &quot;White Lightening&quot;, is not all that heavy--although it is a fine song.<br />&quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot; was the ballad that was the biggest single on this album, but to me the much better ballad here is &quot;Tonight&quot;, as it has much better harmonies as well as lyrics.<br />The one true rocker on this album is the last track--the epic &quot;Tear It Down&quot;, which was originally heard on rock radio back in the &quot;Hysteria&quot; days as a B-side to one of that album's singles.  I loved that song when it came out and was glad they decided to include it here.<br />This album is quite simply not as epic as all of its predecessors, but it is still a very worthy entry in this band's catalog.  I bought this the week it came out over 10 years ago and played it all the time like with most Lep albums.  It is still a very fun album to listen to.  It just doesn't rock all that hard compared to the '80s stuff.
B0000640VO|5.0|Just after the start of the director's commentary in English on disc 1 of \\"Amelie,\\" Jean-Pierre Jeunet warns the viewer something along these lines: \\"If you want to keep the beauty of the film, the poetry of the film, intact . . . DON'T LISTEN TO ME!\\"<br />Granted, that advice may hold true for the commentary, with Jeunel pointing out which beautiful images were really only special effects or how many takes were required of certain scenes that look completely natural in the context of the film. But it almost certainly does not hold true for the DVD treatment itself of \\"Amelie,\\" which, even if it contained only half the features that it does, would STILL be one of the most wonderful and creative uses of the medium thus far. (And I say this because, as of right now, I've still only gotten through about half of those features myself!)<br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet admits to being a \\"control freak\\" here, and that may well be a large reason for including a whole other disc of material whose running time is probably as long as \\"Amelie\\" itself. But, in this case at least, the backstory is just as engrossing, and it actually serves to complement \\"Amelie's\\" themes of destiny and that sense of wonder that goes unnoticed by most people. Here's the best of what I've seen of it so far:<br />-- At the Q&A with Jeunet at the American Cinematheque in L.A.  last January, he good-naturedly apologizes for his broken English; as with that version of the director's commentary, an interpreter prompts him periodically. (Of course, considering that he apparently didn't speak it at all when he directed \\"Alien: Resurrection,\\" I didn't think his English was that bad.) He goes through a few of the true and even autobiographical elements of \\"Amelie\\" and, when asked about the influence of the French New Wave, blurts out, half-mockingly and to great applause, \\"FORGET THE NEW WAVE!\\" A \\"new wave\\" lasts for three seconds, Jeunet says -- not 50 years. Plus, he said it was better to make a French film that the audience would enjoy -- not just the filmmakers.<br />-- The screen tests feature Audrey Tautou, Urbain Cancelier (Collignon, the grocer) and Yolande Moreau (Madeleine Wallace, the concierge), but it's pretty obvious who's the star here. It's absolutely breathtaking to watch the lo-res video footage and see Audrey Tautou finish giving the screenmakers three-quarter shots of her face and then scrunch it up, open her eyes and just EMBODY Amelie -- and then go back to being an actress again. With Cancelier and Moreau, there's a similar sense that there's something happening, too.<br />-- My favorite feature so far, though, is the informal chat with Jeunet, which basically features the director sitting in (presumably) his office, facing the camera and just talking in French about some of the details that he faced while preparing and filming \\"Amelie.\\" Some of them seem downright laughable now: He'd said in interviews that he'd wanted to make a small French film with universal, heartwarming appeal but didn't think that he had the stuff for it, couldn't get financing at first for it and then was rebuffed at Cannes because the president of the festival thought the film depicted a \\"nauseating Paris.\\" It's also interesting to visualize Emily Watson in the role of Amelie: Jeunet initially was so dead-set on getting her that he had an English version of the screenplay written because she didn't speak French. But, just as with \\"Amelie\\" itself, it's hard not to break into a smile when Jeunet describes the sensation that the movie caused in France. In the first weekend, \\"Amelie\\" almost equals the overall admissions of his first feature, \\"Delicatessen.\\" The French title of the movie becomes a pun in newspaper headlines throughout the country. And, following a private screening at the Presidential Palace, Jacques Chirac declares it one of the best nights that he's ever had (after a bad day that apparently included burning himself while making eggs over easy) and feels invigorated enough to go back to work again. My favorite part, though, is when Jeunet shows off two pieces of mail that he received from a particularly solid fan of \\"Amelie.\\" There's a thank-you letter featuring Fotomat pictures of the girl dressed up as Zorro and then what appears to be a mock-up of the Garden Gnome. Neither piece of mail has Jeunet's address: They get to him because the girl has written an apparently persuasive enough letter to her mailman and included it with each package.<br />Anyway, you get the idea, and this is just a SMALL part of what's contained here. Of course, some of the stories are repeated a couple of times (both in English and in French), and it may be a bit extraneous to some viewers to sit through things like the Audrey Tautou blooper/out-take reel, the storyboard comparison and the multiple mentions that, YES, the color was digitally enhanced. But in a way, all these features reinforce the fact that \\"Amelie\\" really is a film much greater than the sum of its parts, and just as with the film itself, there's almost always something to catch your eye and demand your attention.<br />Bottom line, though: The DVD package of \\"Amelie\\" is beautifully faithful to the magic of the theatrical version, and it will definitely be something to treasure for a long, long time.ted enough to go back to work again.

B0000640VO|5.0|I saw all the 5 nominees for best picture for the academy awards (including A beautiful mind) and also the picture who won best foreign (no man's land) and this one has my vote for the best picture, american and foreign, of 2001. First of all it has a great look, not your typical color movie but more like a beautiful painting. You have a lot of green and red colors which makes it look different and particular but it works and the film look more artistic. One thing that makes a film work usually is the relation you develop with the main character(s), let me tell you I was in love with Am&eacute;lie (Audrey Tautou) 5 minutes after I've seen her for the first time. She reminded me of the other Audrey (Hepburn) who you fell in love with everytime you see her on the screen. This Audrey Tautou has the charm and the beauty that I can't find anywhere today (Julia Roberts...don't make me laugh). Her character has such a beautiful soul and so many sweet qualities that you love and root for her even more as the story goes along. The other characters surrounding her during this wonderful story are all very colorful and all different in their own way which makes for a richer movie. Since I am a big fan of silent movie, I like the way the story is told, the screenplay is great but a lot is told by images. This is a visual film and I'm not talking about explosions and major hollywood special effects, the emotions of Am&eacute;lie are often seen visually and this way of telling a story is not seen or not enough seen today. The great HBO series six feet under does that. The storyline is simple, Am&eacute;lie tries to make everyone happy around her and not thinking about her own happiness, the magic is the way the story is told and the high caliber performance of Audrey Tautou. The director tell, in one of the interview that you can see on the disc 2 of this double disc DVD, that he wanted Emily Watson (the english actress) for the role of Am&eacute;lie but she declined. She's a great actress but good for us cause Audrey Tautou is more than perfect. I've been waiting a few months for the US version of the movie (because here in Quebec we had a french release since june) and the wait is worthwhile. This is the ultimate version, you can see the french version with or without subtitles, 2 audio commentaries one in french (for me) and one in english and the second disc is full of interesting special features. Many interviews, screen tests, photos of the production, home movies and more. Thanks USA for this ultimate version which is much better than the single disc produced here.use Audrey Tautou is more than perfect.

B000068PQ0|5.0|How can a band follow up two albums like Zaireeka and the Soft Bulletin, both '90s<BR>masterpieces?<br />Fans have anxiously awaited July 16, 2002, for a seemingly silly concept album -- Yoshimi<BR>Battles the Pink Robots (come on . . .). To be honest, i didn't expect much.  It seemed to<BR>be a throwback to their more jacose and ridiculous antics a la Transmissions from Satellite<BR>Heart and Clouds Taste Metallic.  Think:  &quot;Christmas at the Zoo&quot; and &quot;She Don't Use<BR>Jelly.&quot;  Great tracks in their own rite, but i feel the band has steadily improved since<BR>Transmissions.

At times moodier than Bulletin, Wayne<BR>Coyne and the gang mix somber pop ballads (albeit fused with Flaming eccentricity) in<BR>&quot;Are you a Hypnotist?&quot; and &quot;It's Summertime&quot; with the aforementioned glimses into their<BR>past with &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1&quot; which is the album's delve into the Lips'<BR>patent hilarity.<br />&quot;Where are the one-mic distorted drums?&quot; many of you will ask.  It's true, the Lips break<BR>off into more electronics with (gulp) trip-hop beats and Kid A-like synthesis, but with<BR>fabulous results.  Don't you trust the Flaming Lips with more electronics?  the bottom line<BR>is that the Lips still pack the brilliant pop and bizarre minimal lyrics that we've come to<BR>expect.  In many ways, this album is a step forward for the band, despite the universal<BR>acclaim of The Soft Bulletin.<br />The jury is still out on whether this album completely equals the spralling grandeur of<BR>Bulletin or the beautiful community experience of Zaireeka.  Even if it doesn't, it's still one<BR>of the best albums of 2002 so far, and a no-brainer essential purchase.
B000067CPX|3.0|With the soul exception of the title track, the latest installation from the Red Hot Chili Peppers , \\"By the Way\\" is completely and utterly devoid of funk. For true Chili Peppers fans, the new album offers little in the way of the signature slap bass/punk/funk from the days of Mother's Milk and Freaky Style or the creative brilliance and raw, epic quality of Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  The rest of the album is an introspective, dark, excessively melodic, sometimes tripped-out and over-harmonized odessey that leaves few glimpses of greatness. In an attempt to re-invent themselves, the sex-groove-funk of taken a back seat to inanely simplistic progressions, sophomoric rhyming and Beach Boy-reminescent vocals.<BR>       When asked in the early nineties black and white documentary \\"Funky Monks\\" how to describe the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea defined the band as a group of brothers with a love beauty, life, music and specifically, funk music.  This leaves you wondering....  What happened to the epic band that redefined alternative music in the last decade.  However, some respect must be given.  Exceptional tracks include the Ska flavored \\"On Mercury,\\" the suite-like \\"Venus Queen,\\" and the beautifully orchestrated masterpiece, \\"Midnight\\" (which should be the Peppers next single, and potentially their next classic radio monster).  Parting though:  BRING BACK THE FUNK!!!!!!!!!!

0375703861|2.0|What a disappointment. Smith has cobbled together lots of stories and lots of characters, but with almost no precision whatsoever. This is a page-turner for sure, but the almost total lack of characterization or observation of human nature, and smug posturing make for a tiresome read indeed. Comparisons to Rushdie are not only totally outrageous (he knows how to write with depth, feeling, and intellect) but also mildly racist, positing as they do that any writer of color chronicling immigrant life in London must be like Rushdie. Stop thinking about buying this book and go to the master. For a book on being a colored immigrant in London, pick up Satanic Verses instead.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has matured, and the result is an incredible soundscape filled with relevent philosophical and spiritual ideas and questions.<br />Like many have said, Lateralus is built from the ground up.  Dany Carrey's incredible drumming and Justin Chancellor's perfect bass playing provide the foundation for Adam Jones' surprisingly great guitar playing (he's definitely improved on each album) and Maynard James Keenan's haunting vocals.  The music isn't just stacked like pancakes, however.  It moves, it flows, and it breathes.  It is a living creature, at times a banshee, at others a seductress.  But it is indeed alive.<br />Like another reviewer said, this album is all about enlightenment.  It's about removing barriers and learning about what's on the other side.  There's no whining about ex-girlfriends, parents, or any of the other cliches that have saturated the music industry for the past 10 years or so.  Rather, this is a philosophical and a surprisingly spiritual album (thankfully, it's anything but preachy).<br />For Tool fans that haven't bought Lateralus yet (are there any that haven't?), this album is more like the song &quot;Third Eye&quot; from Aenima than anything else (although perhaps not quite that abstract).  For those mainstream rock fans out there, be warned: not only is the subject matter of the album completely different from anything you probably listen to, the music is a challenge as well.  Nothing is predictible on the album, but neither is it chaotic.  It's art.  It's a masterpiece.
0316666343|5.0|I have to say to the critics before me that they need to take this book more for concept and less for writing.

Her heaven is by no means a catechism class, but her ideas are fresh and bold and need to be taken for what they are...FICTION.<br />The book has some dry spells, but she keeps you going.  I wish she would have gone more into the murder and murderer, but alas, we cannot have it all.<br />Read the first sentence and tell me if you want to read this book.

B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon plays an airhead fashion major who after is dumped by her boyfriend decides to go to Harvard.  Witherspoons character Elle Wood is left high and dry on a night she was expecting a wedding perposal.  Her boyfriends family just wouldn't be able to except her and if he wants to make Senator by time he is 30, he needs a gal who is a little more serious.  Elle gets the idea in her head that if she gets into Harvard and shows that she too can be smart and professional, then he will have no choice but to take her back.  Once in Harvard, she is humillated and made fun of.  Determined to succeed, Elle shows the world what she is made of.  This movie is funny and enteraining, not highly believable, but fun non the less.  I really enjoyed Witherspoons acting, I feel that the more films she makes, the more she has developed into a good actress.  Supported by Luke Wilson, this is a clean film that the entire family can enjoy.
B000021YQV|4.0|While I'm not a huge fan of the hard rock genre (especially the new hard rock), I do like System Of A Down. They pretty much play in the same vein as Rage Against The Machine, only harder and more aggressive. I kept hearing how great Toxicity is and it topped all the year end lists, so I felt I had to get it or I just wasnt human or something. Although I think I could live without it, Toxicity is much more of an accomplished record than any of the hard rock beside it on the shelf at your local music shop, and I think its worth a listen-if even for the political statements. The band is great because they have something to say and they don't wear grotesque masks..isn't that a little ridiculous? \\"The Prison Song\\" opens the album with a loud crunch and doesn't lose its steam at all. Radio Staples \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Chopsuey!\\" don't aim to please-theyre there and the fact that theyre so outrageously powerful is just the way it is. Which makes me wonder why other bands just make art for themselves and not for commercial radio-I could drop some names, but I'm not in an evil mood. It just comes down to this: SOAD is the real thing, and while their tactics sometimes seem melodramatic, the music rocks and the message comes through as well-like a breath of fresh air.
B00003CXTG|3.0|I believe that a film of this caliber requires something Pearl Harbor does not have.  The events of that day mean so much to so many people that the film makers owed it to themselves to make a movie based solely on facts, like Black Hawk Down, and not Hollywood fluff.  The main attack outline is good, but the love triangle developed in this film did not happen, it was only added so that this film would offer something for both men and women.  Making the leading men of this movie seem like heroes that day was a joke.  We were never able to mount an air attack and our pilots did not shoot down 7 Jap planes.  If not for the special effects, this movie would be unbearable.  The acting is not spectacular and Ben Affleck needs to go back to acting school.  If you own this DVD, don't waste your money on the new expanded set, it will only bring more disappointment to a film that could have been so much more.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Is Spiderman entertaining?  Mostly.  However, when this movie goes bad, it goes really bad.  The awful way the sequel setup manages single handedly to knock the rating down a star.  The acting is adequate for a summer movie (though Willem Defoe rocks), and the effects are good (also expected for a summer movie).  I like that a moral is included (or beaten in).  The fight scenes are just OK, and the pacing could be sped up a little.  Best movie ever?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

B000067CPX|5.0|It's been worth the 3-year wait to be able to listen to new Chili Pepper music. Their sound has changed so much over the years, and I'm completely for it. I can't imagine how people can say that \\"Californication\\" was a better CD. There's only 1 song on this CD I would skip (#13 On Mercury) whereas I would stop listening to \\"Californication\\" after the sixth song. That's where most of the best music stops on that album. Not so here. I do miss songs like \\"Suck my kiss,\\" but the Peppers' new sound is spectacular. The title track is a nice single, with the only downside being Anthony's short spurts of words during some parts of the song. \\"Universally Speaking\\" is an easy-to-listen-to song, and then the haunting music starts. \\"This is the Place\\" just has an aura to it. What a great song. \\"Dosed\\" is the first example of how great John's guitar intros are throughout the CD. \\"Don't Forget Me\\" showcases Anythony's great voice. He just makes that song. He shows so much range on By the Way. The sixth track has more of a \\"positive\\" sound to it, which is why I'm still wondering why some people say the CD is depressing to listen to. \\"Can't Stop\\" is my personal favorite song, and John just kills it. That riff is just amazing. The following ballad is strangely placed in my opinion, but it works with the LA vibe. \\"Midnight\\" sends us back to the eerie feel, but after a bit the song gets going and sounds like an anthem. The next song is good stuff because Flea kicks in first, then Chad starts going, and John makes this song for me. I don't like Anthony's lyrics, but they can't ruin the song for me. About 2 minutes into the song, John gets it going with another great riff. It adds to the eerie feel. I could care less for \\"Cabron's\\" lyrics, but again its the intro which is hot. \\"Tear\\" is the song that I think most represents the album. Beautiful lyrics, Anthony sounds great, the background vocals are wonderful, and John sounds great throughout the song. \\"On Mercury\\" is the only track I don't care about, but it's not horrible. I just don't think it fits on this album. \\"Minor Thing\\" sounds like something off of BSSM (Which is a good thing), \\"Warm Tape\\" is yet another song with that LA feel, and \\"Venice Queen\\" is a nice way to end the album. Maybe \\"Californication\\" rocked harder but \\"By the Way\\" is the complete package. Right up there with BSSM.
B000002UB3|5.0|Well, it's really hard to say what is the Beatles' &quot;best,&quot; and it's hard to believe that anyone on earth has never heard this for themselves. But if you need a recommendation, I'd say buy it!<br />My take on the album is that it is beautifully dark -- or do I mean bluesy? -- and full of depth. It's a London sort of blues, isn't it? So, the name Abbey Road really fits. I wouldn't compare it with the Who's Tommy as others have done. Uh-uh. For a later example of similar quirky, stylish, dark, beautiful, and blue British rock, check out &quot;Underwater Moonlight&quot; by the Soft Boys. Or, instead of comparing this to other albums, think of the people around them, or just the Zeitgeist. Billy Preston plays on the album. George Martin's production is brilliant. Monty Python, soon to befriend them, made their television debut the same month Abbey Road was released. Yoko Ono. And the world then. 1969 was a dark year. Brian Jones died. Also recall war protests, Stonewall riots, the Manson murders, the Hells Angels fiasco at Altamont. Well, Abbey Road isn't THAT dark, but, somehow very much a 1969 thing. And their world then. The fact that they were growing apart, and the ambivalence they must have felt then. Here we have the Beatles as the adults they would be forever more. No longer lads. Lennon turned 29 the month it was released. And he sounds 29.<br />A grown-up album, but I understood it even as a child. I turned 9 in October 1969. My sisters bought it and I remember listening to it over and over all night on Christmas Eve, connecting on some visceral level with the album. Especially, &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy).&quot; You would think a 9 year old would connect better with Octopus' Garden, but...<br />On this album, you find the beginnings of John Lennon's (and also George Harrison's) solo directions. I spent all night the NEXT Christmas Eve listening to Plastic Ono Band, again, and again. Same visceral connection. Paul McCartney is, in my opinion, athis very best on this album. I don't think &quot;Oh, Darling&quot; is so retro sounding as others have described it. I think it's Paul really letting loose. So raw. He masterminded the medley on side two as well -- which is without a doubt a peak moment in the history of rock and roll. Too bad he didn't continue in this bluesy mode in his solo career. The charming, goofy Maxwell's Silver Hammer foreshadows his later work more than his best tracks here. I heard somewhere that Lennon particularly hated that song. If I listen to the album now, I usually try to skip it.<br />I was shocked to find so many other customer reviews that listed Octopus' Garden as a great track. That song breaks up the perfection of the album for me. It woulda fit in better on Sesame Street than on Abbey Road. Just program your CD player to skip that one, too. I mean no disrespect to Ringo. He's a fabulous drummer, and seems to be a sweet person, but... Well, Paul wrote that one, anyway, didn't he?<br />Skip one or two tracks, and you've got a masterpiece.

B000067CPX|4.0|I have to give major props for RHCP keeping their music fresh even after nearly two decades.  This is not something that most bands are good at, where usually the first couple albums are their defining work, and downhill from there.<br />Being a long time fan of RHCP since the early 90s with BSSM, I have almost all the albums.  BY THE WAY shows influence from all of the albums: some of their earlier funkiness, the rapping, as well as the softer ballads that were more recent.  <br />What is great about this album is its diversity, almost every song is vastly different from the next, which I attribute to Frusciante's eclectic guitar skills.  <br />I feel that this album is 50% Californication 25% BSSM and 25% older material.  I don't feel One Hot Minute should be compared because of Navarro's different influence on the music.<br />Overall, great album. I love Midnight perhaps the best of all tracks.  I give it 4 stars, because few albums are perfect, however I would give BSSM a 5. (favorite album of the 90s)<br />Thanks guys for not letting me down!
B00005JLDW|4.0|I went into this movie with the justification from previous reviews that it would be a film that was mediocre, familiar and (I can't believe someone said this) boring!  Ok, let's review here, fire breathing dragons scorching the earth and destroying mankind! Someone please tell me how this can possibly be boring!!!???  The fact remains, here folks, is that Matthew McConaughey is about ready to break!  All those movies you've seen him in prior to this one will be long gone from the minds of teenage girls everywhere because it's official, Matthew is our next action superstar!  People keep saying it's Vin Diesel but they're already behind the times because Matthew is fresh and with the exception of U-571 has not really helmed an action film on his own...UNTIL NOW!!  And a really good action film at that!  I noticed one reviewer on here mentioned this movie won't attain a classic status-EGGHEAD REVIEWER FIND ANOTHER HOBBY-OK!  This is a movie that will have amazing staying power for milleniums to come.  It's got a not-so-conventional storyline that breaks all the rules about action/drama/romance and fuses these qualities with meticulous precision and first rate actors that actually know what they're doing instead of just looking pretty in front of the camera.  This is more of a visual storybook rather than just a no-name summer flick.  Yes, the dragons are exceptionally cool.  One scene in particular comes to mind when one dragon completely wipes out an entire squad of soldiers.  You can feel the power of this thing and the realism far exceeds that of any video game.  Another scene that comes to mind is when Matthew McConaughey walks into a celebration of villagers who have learned good news after killing one of the dragons.  McConaughey blows the crowd and the audience away with his phenomenally emotional speech.  You really need to see the movie to see what I mean.  My only dissappointment was Christian Bale!  He just didn't fit this movie even though I am huge fan of him.  We know he can change the accent of his voice and we know from \\"American Psycho\\" that he sure can play a complex character but what we're really looking for in him is something that just goes beyond the capabilities of this movie.  This move belongs solely to McConaughey and the only thing good about Bale being a part of this is that he rides with the ensemble cast very well.  My hope is that Bale embraces more dramatic roles that really kick arse!  Go see this movie simply to witness McConaughey's new dramatic/action turn.  After seeing this, you will quickly forget he ever played in \\"The Wedding Planner.\\"him.

B000053VAF|5.0|My favorite movie from one of my favorite writer/directors, is also my favorite dvd.  this two disk set is packed with extra features, two commentary tracks and tons of deleted scenes, with an introduction to each by kevin smith himself.  the movie itself is filled with both comedy and drama, similar to chasing amy, and again, the balance is excellent.  the comedy in this movie has (except maybe jay's lines) definately grown since, say, mallrats, and was equally hilarious, if not more.  the movie is thought-provoking, action-packed, and gut-busting.  everything about this movie is great.  it is also not in any way blasphemous no matter what some of the right-wing christians may say.  i loved this movie, and would reccomend to anyone to see it as soon as you can.
B000067CPX|5.0|Grant it, I am not a huge RHCP fan, but some of their songs are great.  I really wanted to get Californication, but the only songs i like was the title track and \\"Otherside.\\"  I love Anthony's sound and think he has a great singing voice and flea's guitar playing is amazing.  In this album, they finally make an album where every song expresses their talents.  I'm sure some RHCP fans will feel that this album is a change for them, but i embrass it.  They are starting to evolve into a great band.  I just love the melodies and sounds they make.  A fantastic album!!!

0385503954|5.0|I started this book in an evening and wasn't able to put it down until well past 2 AM! There is a lot of detail in the first section of the book, but it really sets the scene for the events to come. The characters and the setting are masterfully constructed, and they only improve in later sections of the book. The part about Dunkirk is so vivid, you feel you are there with the soldiers.<BR>This is an amazing book- you won't be disappointed if you read it!

0380789019|4.0|Have you ever really looked at a big city? Not just glanced around at the shops and the tall buildings, but actually looked? I have, and with so much space and so many people, I get the feeling that things must be going on that most people don't know about. How much more is there than meets the eye? <br />Neverwhere  grabs that feeling and runs with it. Richard Mayhew is an everyday guy who lives a normal life in London. One day he sees a girl bleeding on the street. She obviously needs help...but why doesn't she want to be taken to a hospital? Why can't anyone else seem to see her? And, most importantly, who are these unpleasant-looking men knocking on Richard's door? Richard and the reader are quickly drawn into London Below, a world where you never know what will show up next and where nothing (and no one) is as benign as it would seem. The book is extremely readable, darkly funny, and filled to the brim with allusions. <br />Unfortunately, there are several major problems with this book. The characters are mostly stock, particularly Richard, who is a little too everyday to seem realistic, especially considering what he manages to do by the book's end. The plot, at its core, is a fairly standard one, and you're likely to figure out many of the surprises well before they come. What really disappointed me, though, was the way Gaiman failed to flesh out so many of the characters and groups he describes. A sense of mystery is a good thing to some extent, but it would be nice to know who the Seven Sisters, or the people with goggles, or any number of others, really are. There were also a few other things that made very little sense, such as the elevator down to the labyrinth. <br />Despite these flaws, Neverwhere is still a good book, and I recommend it. It's also a quick read, so even if you don't like it, you won't have wasted mushc of your time. The only book I know of that surpasses its sense of urban weirdness is Perdido Street Station by China Mieville. I'll besnapping up Neil's latest book, American Gods, as soon as it comes out in paperback.
B000001IPL|5.0|Offspring is what got me into rock, and I couldn't have asked for a better intro.  This is just a great album.  Unlike so many CD's today that have 1 or 2 good songs on them, Offspring gives you an entire album of great stuff.

B00005YXZH|5.0|It's amazing to see an album like this being slammed for not being melodic enough, being too obtuse, etc.  These are exactly the words that Reprise's label heads used to excuse rejecting YHF.  What we have here are people who do not look at an album in terms of an artist's career, but rather what hooks or easily identifiable emotions it has.  These are the same types of peopl e who, in the 60's, hated Pet Sounds because there were no songs about chicks, California, or surfing on it.  In other words, don't challenge me;  I'd rather listen to A.M. and Sheryl Crow than actually have to spend time to get to know an album, learn all of its nooks and dark places.  It's exciting to see a band like this expand its boundaries in so many cool directions, and you don't have to be a hip music critic to understand what's going on with YHF.  You just need a little patience.  It's a grower.
B00004Z459|5.0|i love this CD. you hardly ever find a CD where u can just listen to it all the way through and love every song, but u can with this CD. one thing i really appriciate about linkin park is that they don't use profanity so it's also a CD u can listen to in front of just about anyone. i personally listen to this CD every day. i would suggest this CD to almost everyone. all the songs have their own style and the lyrics are so true and very relatable. the best songs are 1, 4, and 7. BUY THIS CD!!
0790742322|4.0|When a young couple Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Bladwin and Geena Davis) die, they return to their house as ghosts without any possibility of leaving their own home. Innocently they think that the dead have no problems but they couldn't be more wrong. A New York family, Charles and Delia Deitz (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) and their daughter, Lydia (Winona Ryder) move into the Maitlands home. The situation would have been all right but unfortunately, the family decides to re-decorate the whole house with 'modern art'. Adam and Barbara do all they can to get rid of them to no avail. They believe that only one person can help them and his name is Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetlejuice, played by Michael Keaton), a bio-exorcist. But Adam and Barabara just might be getting even MORE trouble than they bargained for!<br />A very... how would I put it... 'interesting' and 'strange' movie. The director Tim Burton has an incredible imagination, using the movie as a advantage to put his clever ideas and dark humor into the plot. \\"Beetlejuice\\" most definitely falls into the category of a dark comedy, the boundaries of the strange and remarkable broken through.<br />The acting is done very well with a star-studded cast. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are strangely play their part as 'the cute but dumb couple'. Alec Baldwin has always been a favorite of mine playing Jack Ryan in \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" and Lamont Cranston/The Shadow in \\"The Shadow\\" so seeing him in this movie was a treat. Winona Ryder was also delightful as the 'strange and unusual' girl who is the only one who can see the Maitlands. But by the end she just makes an total about-face in her character. Jeffrey Jones who I liked a lot as Matthew Broderick's principal in \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" also has a good role as does Catherine O'Hara. But Michael Keaton takes the prize for being absolutely perfect for his part as Beetlejuice. He gives such a remarkable performance, making the character of Beetlejuice give you scares, chills, and laughter.<br />The special effects are just fun to see as it's being put to good use. From the creepy light effects, the strange creatures in the 'recently deceased waiting room', Beetlejuice's incredible scary forms, and much, much more! <br />The movie is very hilarious in a dark sense. The movie is rated PG since for kids I must admit it might be scary, some jokes aren't for kids, and for some language (on of the reasons I give the movie 4 stars). But my favorite part of the movie has to be the scene where the Deitzs have invited some guests for dinner. And for dinner something very strange goes on, they get haunted by ghosts in a very HILARIOUS way! I laughed soooooo hard in the scene!<br />So, if you're looking for an escape from a dull and boring evening, put \\"Beetlejuice\\" on and I'm sure you'll have an enjoyable time!
B00004U28G|1.0|One of the worst movies of all time (that distinction goes to the sequel, CRII)  All they needed was Clyde the Orangatan and it would be complete!
0316666343|5.0|The premise of this story fascinated me and that's why I ordered it. I found it deeply moving and somewhat depressing, and couldn't look away from it--like passing an accident or roadkill on the highway. Sebold writes Susie a tad too \\"hip\\" for her age, a little too philosophical and wise, like going to Heaven suddenly turned her into Freud. At times, it seemed that Sebold had a difficult time writing as a 14 year old, and Susie talked and thought like someone in her 30's. And I had the idea that she was somehow attracted to her killer although other reviewers have called it \\"compassion\\". I also found her earthly visit hard to digest--do the dead get horny? Because that's what seems to have happened to Susie. Sebold also makes Heaven sound boring..no pot roast or pizza?? At least Susie was reunited with her beloved dog. But the premise that we don't get to see everyone we lost is scary. But other than that, the book was one of the best I've ever read, and in light of recent events, a little too real.
0446677450|1.0|This book is a hard read - the first part of the book is written at 3rd grade level; it seems the author wanted to stretch out his thoughts to make the book look thicker to the book buyer.  The principals in this book can be found in better books - &quot;Millionaire Next Door&quot; and the &quot;Millionaire Mind&quot;.  Read these books and pass on &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; and you will learn more about how the rich became rich.
0679720200|1.0|I'm sure that I'm missising something here. Or maybe all of the people who wrote their glowing reviews of this book are missing something, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing style was like a Junior High School student trying to write their first story. Really more than just a list of sequential events like, I woke up, I went to work, I went to bed. I found after a few pages that I didn't really care what happened to the main character any more than he seemed to care what happened to himself. The only saving grace was that it was such a short book that I was able to read it in about two hours. I know that Camus is well respected and was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, but based on this book I can't understand or imagine why.
B000066I6N|4.0|While I much prefer Plant working with the guitar wizard, Jimmy Page, I have always followed Robert's stuff.  Although I did not much care for anything after \\"Shaken and Stirred,\\" I have to admit this is a superb effort by the master himself.  It took me a few listens to the entire CD to really appreciate it. My first quandry with this release was that Robert did not write the majority of this CD.  The version of \\"Hey Joe\\" does this CD justice alone.  Robert still has it!  No, he is not the Robert from 1969 or even 1979, but how can you dispute a man of his age giving out such a great effort?  I was fortunate enough to see Page/Plant 3 times during their reunion.  Plant's vocals sailed across the rafters in the inital concert I witnessed. He is the epitome of the greatest rock vocalist of all time!  This CD has some filler, but it is minimal.  It is such a reckoning that he is still able to put out a quality CD with such power.  If you are looking for a heavy metal rendition of the old, please do not have high expectations.  Robert is true to the point. That point being that he is a true blues lover, and one of the last of the \\"mohicans\\" in that he has never abandoned his true roots and love for true music.  Refreshing and different.  Long live the Zep roots of old. Let us protect the memory of the master himself.  God help us if he again reunites with guitar wizard, Page.  One more boys?  (Perhaps with JPJ and maybe a qualified drummer like Tommy Aldridge, Alex Van Halen, Aynsley Dunsbar, or the ghost of John Bonham (just wishing).  Despite the aging of this fine vocalist, and the fact that several clones have tried to imitate him, he remains the master of the art! I cannot take this one out of the player!
B00006690G|5.0|This CD is sooo awesome, i love it!! Without Me is like one of the worst songs on the CD, that is how awesome it is!! Tight songs include White America, Cleanin' Out My Closet (from his new movie coming out, \\"8 Mile\\"), Square Dance, Soldier, Without Me, Sing For The Moment(An Aerosmith song redone), Superman(Tightest Song!!), Halie's Song(Not a bad singer!), Say What You Say(JD diss, tight!), Till I Collapse(Nate Dogg is featured in this, he's the MAN!), and My Dad's Gone Crazy are all awesome songs!! That's pretty much the whole CD!! I Suggest anyone who likes Eminem will love this CD!! GO GET IT TODAY!!
B000056K04|4.0|First of all, I wanna let it be known that I wouldn't consider myself to be a die-hard fan of DMB, but I did enjoy Under the Table and Dreaming, and I loved the singles from Crash and Before These Crowded Streets, though I never decided to buy those albums as well. Now after saying that, I wanna say that I absolutely love Everyday! Sure it sounds different from the old DMB songs, but I think this album shows how much DMB can rock, and for that I wanna salute them. The only songs that I don't really care for are If I Had It All and Fool to Think (thus the reason for 4 stars cause if those songs were gone this one would get a 5 definitely), but the other songs more than make up for those two missteps, especially The Space Between, Dreams of Our Fathers, What You Are and Everyday. With the exception of the two previously mentioned songs, each and every one of these songs are genuinely special in their own right, and they rock like you've never heard before. I do plan on buying Busted Stuff, but until I do I'll be more than happy listening to Everyday. I think new fans of them should definitely pick this one up for their collection, and the die-hards should really stop bashing them for doing something different. If they actually took the time to listen to the songs, they'd learn that while at first listen they don't really grab you like they should, but by the time you've heard it 3 or 4 times all the songs really come alive and you can't help but loving them. The band did make a dramatic change with this one, but I for one believe they did an excellent job with it. This is a great DMB cd and one that I am very proud to say I own.
B000067CQK|5.0|Ziggy played guitar 30 years ago, and still rocks as hard as ever. While the 1999 remaster of the album committed sin by omitting it, the back of the album is once again displaying &quot;TO BE PLAYED AT MAXIMUM VOLUME&quot;... for those who had yet to figure the obvious out. <br />A splendid package, which almost appears to be one book that happens to include two cds. The first cd is the original album, untainted by additional bonus tracks, in it's original conceptual form. The second cd is full of era-specific b-sides, demos, etc related to the period. While most of these appeared on the 1990 Ryko cds, they've been remastered and put back into print into one place in a nice little sequence. It's been long over due.<br />It would have been a crime to have included all of these songs on one cd, as another reviewer had suggested.<br />Sure this may include three versions of Moonage Daydream, but really, can you go wrong with that song? No, I didn't think so. I was only surprised that they didn't re-issue the Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture live album at the same time as this, but perhaps they're waiting to release it with the DVD release.<br />You can't go wrong with this.. the nearly complete story of one of rock's finest moments.

0375703861|4.0|Zadie Smith's White Teeth at first glance is an examination of the role that race, gender and religion play in London, England. But it is also a deeper look at how memory and history shape people and society. The novel follows Archibald Jones, \\"the chaff\\" of Britain and Samad Iqbal, a Muslim Bengali through the scenery of war, marriage, parenthood and religious fanaticism.<BR>White Teeth weaves present and past together, creating identity through oral histories. These pivotal stories are set apart as \\"Root Canal\\" stories, which explain where the characters believe their roots lie.  In this way, White Teeth, becomes the overarching metaphor for story telling.<BR>By incorporating the tooth metaphor that she laid out in the novel's title, Smith ties in the concept of oral history.  Smith gives these oral histories as much attention as she does to her characters' stories in the present. Smith suggests that, true or not, these oral histories - these memories as deep as any other roots - shape who they are. <BR>In summing up his roots, Samad's telling of his great-grandfather's near brush with heroism and fame becomes a running joke throughout the novel. At the same time that the repetition is humorous, Smith allows a more serious aspect to creep in. Samad holds his great-grandfather on a pedestal of achievement but his story is so inconsistent - it conflicts with written history and is subject to numerous confused re-tellings - that the reader quickly understands the problem of putting too much faith in memories and story telling.<BR>Irie reinforces this message as she attempts to retrace her family's story. In her case, too many stories are missing. The roots of her past are as absent as her mother's two front teeth. <BR>What is so compelling about Smith's oral history/teeth as family tree metaphor is that she uses it to equally discredit her theory that the characters' pasts decide who they are. Despite all the tensions of race, ethnicity, gender and age, and the ever-present problem of assimilation among the younger generations, the one thing all the characters have in common is their white teeth. <BR>Smith does a magnificent job of demonstrating how everyone - no matter how British or how \\"normal\\" - has roots that set them apart. This sense of not belonging is exactly what unifies us in the end.

B000022TSH|5.0|Roman Polanski's `Chinatown' is apt to fill a movie lover with longing for a lost time in Hollywood. Polanski himself, being interviewed for the DVD release, expresses with certainty that a movie such as `Chinatown' could never be produced in today's commercial climate. The story, concerning private eye Jake Gittes and Evelyn Mulwray, with its willingness to construct a realistic ending and its refusal to condescend to the audience, seems almost unthinkable in an age that focuses on cheap distraction for entertainment. Thankfully, though, `Chinatown' was created under the necessary circumstances to leave us with this absorbing motion picture. <br />`Chinatown' begins as an ode to the old noir films, the black and white classics. It features a cool private eye, a seemingly deadly femme fatale, and a scandal just underneath the surface. However, `Chinatown,' made in the 70s, delves deeper into the possibilities than might be expected. It is a color picture, its private eye in a man pained by loneliness, its femme fatale might just be the most decent individual in the film, and the scandal deals not with diamonds or other typical noir devices - but a conspiracy involving water and power.<br />Jack Nicholson stars as Jake Gittes, the private eye at the story's center. `Chinatown' was made before Nicholson had become a huge star. At the time, Nicholson was certainly known, yet he had not quite become `Jack Nicholson' the icon, the personality, the character known for going over the top. In `Chinatown' Nicholson was able to explore his character, and give a wonderful subtle performance. Gittes is a man who pretends to maintain a sense of distance from his clients. Yet as the narrative unfolds, he finds himself more and more incapable of keeping that façade. Gittes' detective work results in his becoming involved in a conspiracy that goes beyond his call of duty. One may wonder why he opted to do these things; but, like all great films, `Chinatown' does not provide the audience with easy answers - the film trusts our intelligence. <br />`Chinatown' offers little commentary as the story progresses. What Polanski does here, rather than stopping to bring the viewer up to speed, is simply drop us in the film and allow us to explore for ourselves. Being a motion picture, `Chinatown' emphasizes the importance of images rather than words. While a great deal of the picture is essentially dialogue, the setting, combined with the actor's facial expressions and gestures, conveys a particular mood. Polanski does a superior job of interweaving the unfolding scandal and the revelations about the characters' secrets. We are confused at first, wondering what is taking place, and then confused once it has been revealed - because we know not what to do. `Chinatown' successfully constructs a general emotion as the movie progresses - a sense of disorder and hopelessness - that ultimately reaches its climax during the scene's famous finale.<br />Polanski and screenwriter Robert Towne reportedly feuded over the film's closing scene. While Towne campaigned for a slightly more upbeat conclusion, Polanski felt that his version of the ending must be upheld `for the film to have any meaning' (as he said in the DVD interview). Indeed, the ending of `Chinatown' remains as one of the most powerful scenes in the history of movies - it manages to express a whirlwind of feelings, none of which point towards any possible conclusion. This illustration of helplessness and commotion in the face of powers that we cannot control perfectly articulates sentiments that all of us have encountered.
B000067CPX|4.0|you may not like this album. I've been a fan ever since my cousin played &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; for me off of Uplift, I was hooked. It took me a couple of listens to get into By the Way but its a really good album. Its only got a bit of funk on it. So if you're expecting another Uplift or BSSM then this isn't the disc for you. But if you come in with no expectations (which is hard to do with this band) you'll see that they've created a really good disc. The songs seem to have a Beach Boys or surf pop feel to them, which isn't a surprise seeing that the band has been listening to alot of the Beach Boys and music like that. John's playing on this album is amazing. He doesn't solo enough (I never feel like he solos enough though) but the guitar parts are amazing on this album. The progressions and voicings he uses are very good and shows how much of a well rounded player he is on this album. Flea and Chad are still there but seems like they were going for a more straight foreward focus on this album. Which was somewhat of a dissapointment being that Flea/Chad is my favorite bass/drum combo in music, they still have their moments but they are very brief. Some of my more liked tunes on this are &quot;Dosed&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, &quot;Tear&quot;. A song that reallt surprised me was &quot;Don't forget me&quot; which is no doubt about John and Anthony's past struggles with addiction. Its a very deep song, and it is a moment when Flea shines, the bass riff that carries the tune is really cool. Its not funky however. They will probably get called &quot;sellouts&quot; for the more poppy feel on this album. But selling out would have been remaking BSSM over and over. They're trying something new, and because its different people are basically going to love it or hate it. I personally love it. It would have got more stars but I wanted a little funkyness on this. But I'm not dissapointed. Also if you wanna get into the Peppers I suggest either Mothers Milk or BSSM, because those are their most well rounded albums.
B000068PQ0|5.0|After releasing the Soft Bulletin it would have been safe to assume that the Flaming Lips had reached the peak of their career.  The album was critically applauded and about as beautiful and orchestrated as pop music can get, which left many believing that the Lips had no more room to advance musically.  Thankfully, they proved us wrong.<br />The music is still as complex as ever, and the tracks are so layered with accoustic guitars, strings, synths and random noises that one can't help but find something new to listen for each time.  Yet two noticeable differences set this album apart from prior Flaming Lips releases.  Most obviously,  'Yoshimi' undeniably has more of a trip-hop feel than its predecessor, but this only adds to it's atmospheric feel and is never distracting.<br />It's the lyrics that set this album apart from the rest, however.  Whereas past releases have found the band singing throwaway silly spacey lyrics, 'Yoshimi's songs actually express a great deal of emotion and vulnerability.  The first single &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; is a sincere, straight forward song about mortality and (who would have thought?) love.  Even on songs less straight forward the listener starts to get the feeling that, for the first time, the robots and weirdness Wayne Coyne are singing about may actually be metaphorical.  <br />Finally, the Flaming Lips have managed to find lyrics as beautiful as their music.  The result is one of the best albums released in years.
B00005JKNF|2.0|(Sigh...)  Another movie that has received a lot of hype, and surprise surprise, fails to live up to it.  Trying to keep track of the characters, especially their names...ha!, is so frustrating that I felt like turning off the movie then.  But I didn't and continued on.<br />There are a lot of talented English actors...many of whom I have barely heard of nor care to see in another movie.  Everything about this movie is like its predecessor, Clue.  People are invited to a large house, yada yada yada, someone's killed, yada yada, whodunit??<br />This is the boring, British version of Clue.  I cannot recommend it because it is boring, difficult to follow, difficult to give a damn about any of the characters (truthfully, did there only have to be ONE murder?  I was hoping everyone but the butler would get it!!!).  Anyway, that's that.
0312265859|3.0|I went with a friend to a book signing for Hard Eight.  Janet Evanovich was very gracious to everyone.  Some readers brought multiple copies of Hard Eight plus copies of earlier paper backs for her to sign. She signed them all and posed for numerous pictures taken by fans.  I really wanted to like this book.  Janet herself was very interesting and I hoped that this new book would be interesting also.  <br />Unfortunately, I did not find it to be any better than the previous books. The quirky relatives, neighbors and coworkers are getting a little old. Stephanie's ineptness is also growing tiring. This is the eighth book - I wish Stephanie would learn some tricks of the bounty hunter trade and become more competent. Losing cars, the inability to catch her prey - same old stuff. Obviously, these books are meant to be light reading - they are not hard crime stories. I enjoy humor in stories, but there was just too much in this book that I would classify as \\"silly\\". Humor is good - silly is not. <br />Books written in series are very good for allowing the reader to be familiar with the cast of characters and circumstances. But, there needs to be enough newness and excitement to keep the readers' interest. My interest in any new Stephanie Plum books has really dropped - in spite of Janet Evanovich herself being a very lovely, nice person. I hope these books keep selling well for Janet's sake, but future purchasers of her books will not include me.
0790729725|3.0|Goodfellas is one of the best film of our times.  A glorious masterpiece of a perfect screenplay, impeccable acting performances, and technical film mastery.  It is sad to say then that the DVD release does not live up to the film.  The first and most obvious flaw is that the film is divided into two sides on the Disc.  How they ever got away with this is beyond my comprehension.  In addition, the 5.1 surround sound is a hatchet job...with 'token' surround noises thrown in for a cheesy, gimmicky soundscape.  I know this was an early DVD release and that some flaws are to be expected, but someone should really redo it and make a new release.  After the fantastic job done on The Last Waltz, there is no excuse why a film of this magnitude has to be presented in this way...shameful !
B000003N7R|5.0|I had heard some of Coltrane's later work and was not very moved by it. But this is an excellent album. I'd recommend it to anyone. The sound that JC wrings out of the sax is just awesome. I heard other renditions of &quot;In A Sentimental Mood&quot;, but none come close to this one in terms of the saxophone work. The rest of the songs are also superb including the very catchy &quot;Angelina&quot;. <br />This was also the first work by Duke Ellington and I am impressed with his compositions; less so by his piano playing. <br />This along with Ballads and My Favorite Things are among the most accessible of Coltrane's works.
B000002H2H|5.0|In these 'nu-metal' days, when numb hyper-freaks decide that there's a 'old' metal (whatever) not worth listening to, is good to remember when one was fifteen and discovered this album at the disco store (at that time was vinyl. Yeah, those days...). And it's fun to remember, in the middle of this (this) days of gabber-gabber-saturated-endless guitar loops, that one bought this album fascinated with its front cover and for its song titles ('Fight Fire with Fire', 'Fade to Black', Trapped under Ice', ...) that promised chills to the spine. But most of all, one bought it under the suspicion that this album was destined to become an endless classic. O.K. I know I know, Metallica has mellowed incredibly over the years (now they dress on Armani). But this album is incredibly raw while melodic, something that lacks every 'nu-metal' band supposed 'to be worth listening to'. So, give it a chance. Learn.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is an album of a touching and beautiful sort, while still managing to be a hardcore kick-... metal fest.  These two qualities will often combine in there style with songs that protest, such as Science, and song that have a message like Chop Suey. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone because I am not a metal head and have this one in my stereo constantly.
0316666343|5.0|It has been a long time since I have sat down and read a book in an entire setting.  I could not put this book down until I had finished it.  It is hauntingly beautiful.  It is so well-written.  I would find myself pausing from time-to-time to just reflect on how well the author had described events, thoughts &amp; feelings.  This is truly a great read!  I look forward to more books by this author.
B00000JPH5|5.0|This movie was one of my favorites as a child, and still is.  The storyline is engaging, the puppetry impressive, and the music is mesmorizing.  Enjoyed by all ages. I recommend this movie to Jim Henson/Fantasy movie-lovers.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Those who dismiss this undeniably popular album due to puerile lyrics (generally leveled at this album's sequel), over-the-top production, and Meat Loaf singing so passionately about such adolescent themes as a badly written farce totally miss the point.  This is an album that pokes fun at all the rock and roll pretensions that had crept into rock music over the years (Townshend can you hear me?), and it succeeds wonderfully.<br />There's no doubt about it.  BAT OUT OF HELL takes all these adolescent themes, mostly raging hormones, and builds, with operatic flair and lots of kitsch, this preposterously silly album which never-the-less struck a chord with a great many people.  BAT OUT OF HELL is a concept album, but it doesn't carry all the serious connotations that such a label implies.  This is Steinman taking all these broad-way musical conventions and hiring Meat Loaf, who could belt out vocals like no one else, and giving these teen-age angst-ridden years such a ridiculous setting that you can't help but laughing at the idiocy of what people thought were so important in their youth.  <br />Steinman's and Meat Loaf's chief critics generally site the bombast and blowing up teen-age angst with such an operatic flair.  They miss the point.  I will always stand behind Steinman's position as an artist because he uses all these so called \\"weaknesses\\" for effect.  It's a very silly album, but then, it's supposed to be.  Even the cover-art is ridiculous.  It's all about that bad boy/girl image that's so laughably fake that no one takes them as any real threat.  Most call it \\"Just a phase they're going through.\\"   <br />Steinman shows how the youth, when they begin taking themselves seriously as adults, are so concerned with issues that as people grow up realise, while important, aren't so damned dramatic as they made it out to be. [The album cover].  I'm sure most people remember wanting to do something out of the norm just so they can appear to be so tough and independent, and looking back are glad they outgrew it.  This could be music or fashion or whatever.  The whole album describes that state of young people wanting \\"bad boy\\" image which is really, really hooky. <br />What makes this such a good album is even though it's all about that awkward transition phase between childhood and adulthood, Steinman deals with real issues, and surprisingly well at that.  It's the very clear craftsmanship and the obvious \\"weaknesses\\" that are actually the strengths that makes this such a strong album.  Although I've never though BAT had a straight-forward narrative, the title track (my personal favorite of both albums) introduces the type of characters we'll be seeing.  The very last track tells of an individual who did make it past this phase and into maturity.<br />One of the more interesting things about BAT OUT OF HELL is its position on sex.  Steinman's lyrics have a very perceptive view of what sex is, and shockingly it's much more along the lines of what Christianity teaches.  Although you cannot conclusively say BAT OUT OF HELL promotes sex only in marriage, it gives several portraits, with very distinct imagery, that suggests that the youth get so tied up in sex that they don't care at all about each other.  The sexual urges has destroyed or drastically hurt most of the relationships depicted on BAT OUT OF HELL with the single exception of the last track.  <br />To me, \\"For Crying Out Loud\\" has always been the key track to BAT OUT OF HELL.  The six songs that go before depict these youth, so bound up in folly they don't know or show real love, continually broken and hurt in their relationships.  In \\"For Crying Out Loud,\\" however, an individual, ravaged with age, has finally found some one to love at last.  They're no longer concerned with sex just for pleasure but they've found actually found a love.  <br />There's such a jump in the age of Steinman's characters between the first six tracks and \\"For Crying Out Loud\\" that it BAT OUT OF HELL actually serves as a warning that if you don't grow up then you'll miss so much of what life has to offer.  The first six tracks describe all the misadventures and stupid, malicious acts that these kids do, and then \\"Paradise By the Dashboard Light\\" transitions the characters from that song into old age, still without love.  \\"For Crying Out Loud\\" then begins and is the only song dealing with an old person, and do to the transition provided in the previous song, it's reasonable to believe that Steinman wants to show what a lifetime of immaturity and bad boy posturing will get you.  Steinman moves to the very heart and moral core of the record.  This is where they discover that they don't have all the time in the world like they thought (in \\"Heaven Can Wait\\").  In the end, they also discover healthy sexuality as well, and are mature enough to raise their own children.<br />It's all these different facets that make BAT OUT OF HELL such a fascinating listen and an amazing artistic triumph.  Most of this album's critics are so far off base they look positively asinine.  <br />Those who are looking for a surprisingly deep and moral record that has a great sense of dramatic flair, this is for you.<br />P. S.  While I enjoy listening to BAT II moreso, from the artistic standpoint this is the better record because its such a cohesive and well-sequenced record.  BAT II has some great songs but doesn't present such a perceptive and far-reaching statement as this record does.
0790729709|5.0|Whitney did a fabulous job acting, especially for her first role, particularly when she had to play a famous singer and really be different from the persona we see Whitney in.  Rachel Marron was TOTALLY different.  I also saw a new side of Whitney in this movie, and I am thrilled Kevin Costner chose her, GOOD TASTE!  He wanted a real singer for his love interest and picking someone as gorgeous as Whitney wasn't bad.  <br />I did love the entire movie, I loved Kevin and Whitney's characters, they both had annoying flaws and yet they drew you into their lives in such an amazing way.  It was wonderful to see the lifestyle more closely of both a bodyguard and an entertainer.  <br />Whitney and Kevin's romance was beautiful, and I did cry at the end, wow.
B00005JCAA|4.0|One of my favorite stories is Death Takes a Holiday, of which I've seen at least two earlier versions over the past decades: one an old black and white film from the 30's occasionally seen on late night TV, and one a made for TV movie staring Monte Markham from the 70s.  Meet Joe Black is a more updated remake.<br />I really didn't anticipate enjoying it as much as I did, since I've found most of the remakes produced recently rather a disappointment.  I had enjoyed the Monte Markham TV version, which is the first one I'd seen,  and I doubted that Brad Pitt, with whose characters I've not been much impressed in the past, would be able to carry off the role.  Anthony Hopkins, however, is one of my favorite actors, and I gambled that any movie that had him in the cast would prove to be worth the time even if the rest of the film were a bust.  I wasn't wrong.<br />In fact, I was rather impressed with the overall production.  The character of the elderly rich man in the TV movie had been less three dimensional, but Hopkins gave him a depth that made the movie work.  His relationship with Death, Brad Pitt, was much more enlightening.  It gave the person of Death room for education and personal growth, which the original movie and the TV special had not done.  In the latter, Death simply appears as a finished character with a job, who sets aside his agenda to see how the \\"other half\\" lives.  Although you like him, Markham's Death doesn't develop as he comes to understand what it means to humans to \\"be alive.\\"  He comes, he sees, he goes.<br />The dynamics between Joe Black and the humans he meets is much more defining.  He begins as a grumpy, rude, arrogant creature with almost no social graces and no sense of humor, and gradually becomes a \\"person.\\"  In fact he becomes the hero, helping others to realize their inner strength and to put the bad guy in his place.  He also has some delightful one liners that go right by most of the other characters but that amuse his mentor Hopkins no end.<br />I did found the pacing of the film a little annoying, however.  The pauses, intended one supposes to be \\"pregnant with meaning,\\" were in fact just time consuming.  While the first one seemed purposeful, those succeeding it seemed contrived.  Sort of \\"did you get the real meaning of this scene?\\"  Or perhaps, \\"Film can be great art.  See how very artistic I can be?\\"  As it seems to have failed with audiences at the box office, one can't help but feel that it might have benefitted from a more ruthless editor!  Still worth seeing.entor Hopkins no end.<br />I did found the pacing of the film a little annoying, however.

B000009ROK|5.0|Luis Miguel is without doubt the best when it comes to singing the spanish ballads of an era gone by.  I grew up with parents who listened to this music and to hear it sang by Luis Miguel is an incredible treat! His voice truly captures the sentiment behind the words and he transforms it in a truly romantic way. You will NOT put this CD away, especially if you are familiar with the music. My mother listens too and she transforms into another era and time. Keep on keeping on Luis Miguel! And you out there, get this album, you will NOT be sorry you did.
0380820846|4.0|Another great read from Julia Quinn just in time for summer reading! As always, I love the characters with their usual humor and engaging dialogue. Turned each page expectantly. Also check out a fresh voice in romance from a male author -Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Very deep with great insight, perfect by the pool. Saw it highlighted as a Top Pick in Romantic Times. Keep them coming, Ms. Quinn!
6305350205|1.0|I was quite disappointed by this movie!...As a long time Trek fan I thought all was lost.  A definite low point.  However, there were at lease a few glimpses of good in it.  The humorous banter was good.  But the music, I thought, was great!!  A bit of a change from all the other movies.  Also the use of, for lack of a better expression, Star Fleet commandos or Marines in the attack on Sybok's stronghold in the desert.  I liked that concept!...They got to kick some butt for a few minutes at least.  The fact that it wasn't just the normal stars from the bridge crew in the fire fight was refreshing.  I like the old crew but I also like the fact that they used other resources at their disposal.  People trained to do just that, it seemed.  That some of the other 450+ personnel on board got to do something besides put on a red shirt and die!! (...Although, everyone wears a red shirt in that time frame now so go figure ;-)...)<BR>If you're not a Trek fan, skip it!  PLEASE!...But if you're a fan, tolerate it then go do something nice for yourself afterwards!...
B000066AXC|3.0|Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, and an strong supporting cast offer extraordinary performances in A BEAUTIFUL MIND--and fortunately so, for the subject of the film has undergone a Hollywood homogenization that renders the film both timid and tepid.  Still worse, both script and direction are unfocused, and much of the film is taken up with a tricksy plot device calculated to manipulate viewers into an unexpected identification with Nash's mental illness.<br />The plot device in question is one recently seen in a number of plot-driven films such as THE SIXTH SENSE; here, however, it proves extremely transparent and feels out of place, and since it requires the film to shift gears several times it contributes to the film's lack of flow.  Moreover, it has the effect of presenting the nature of Nash's illness in very glossy terms that fail to really reflect the seriousness of his condition.  It all has a &quot;santitized for your protection&quot; feel.<br />But when the cast has opportunity to shine it shines with considerable brilliance, and in spite of the film's numerous flaws the actors hold the attention from start to finish.  I have never been a fan of Russell Crowe, and I found his performance in the earliest scenes a bit artificial, but he quickly comes to grips with the role and delivers a powerhouse performance that remains in mind long after the film ends.  Jennifer Connelly is equally powerful as wife Alicia, and the supporting cast (which includes Ed Harris, Judd Hirsch, and Christopher Plummer) is extremely fine.  This is not a great film, but it does contain great performances, and I recommend it on that basis.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|After hearing the third or fourth song while watching the movie, I had already decided that I would buy the soundtrack. I enjoyed its music immensely.<br />However, the CD was somewhat disappointing: several excellent songs are not included in it (\\"Spectacular - Spectacular\\", \\"Like a virgin\\", and at least one more). <br />Finally, the version of \\"Lady Marmalade\\" included in the CD is not only quite different from the movie performance, but it's rendered pretty much as a rap song (ugh!), which takes away considerably from the atmosphere set by the movie and its music.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|I remember the awe and the sorrow I felt when I bought my first copy of Pearl in the early days of 1971.  So much unleashed potential evaporated by the flame, that it seem to haunt the room as I placed the needle to the vinyl to hear the first words \\"You say that it's over.\\"  The good time girl from Port Arthur, Texas whose voice tore at your heart like a ball and chain would sing no longer.<br />Janis Joplin was just 27 years old when she died in October of 1970.  She had put together a band , Full Tilt Boogie, which would dispense with the endless jams and showcase her voice and her talent in a way that wasnt done by Big Brother.  Janis was in the midst of recording Pearl with her vocals tracks for Buried Alive in the Blues scheduled to be recorded the day after her death. Instead Buried Alive in the Blues rests on the album as instrumental filler, a lonely commentary of her life.<br />Pearl is a truly extraordinary album which displays is the range and emotions which Janis' voice was capable of.  It was to be a bridge to better things instead of the lasting musical landmark that it is.  Janis Joplin's voice stretches from gentle and tender in a Woman that's Lonely to pained and sorrowful in Cry Baby to amused in Mercedes Benz.<br />In the days of freedom and loss, Janis Joplin sang Kristofferson's song of freedom and loss with an intense sincerity and pain projected from her depths.  Countless numbers sang along with her \\"Freedom's just another name , for nothing left to lose,\\" knowing full well that there was indeed something more to lose.<br />I still sing her wonderful original song \\"Mercedes Benz\\" to my roses while I garden.  There is such a simplicity attached with the great American wish of striking it rich.  It remains a reminder of her great humor and sense of irony  as well as her incredible talent.<br />Pearl continues to be a cd which showcases a wonderful voice and talent.

B000063CPL|5.0|250,000 people. I would call that an astronomical lot of people at any place, at a given time. While all previous live efforts by Maiden suffered a lot in production (esp. the drums), this one excels. Infact, the songs from Brave New World sound so much better live than in studio. Bruce Dickinson wails and shrieks like he used to before. The crowd is more vociferous and full of energy. This is a thoroughly exemplifying performance that proves that rock is indeed not dead...and that heavy metal will always remain the cockroach of rock...omnipotent and eternal. <br />People who hate this album, as I presume, must belong to the hordes of fans of nu-metal or rock-rap. Here's a message to all you folks who think old-school is dead...FILL A STADIUM FULL OF 250,000 FANS, AND THEN WE'LL TALK!!<br />Hail the Irons!!!

B00005QW5X|5.0|I made the mistake of watching the entire film before seeing the documentary about the story of Hedwig, which made the entire story so much more fascinating.<br />Great music, a real rock-n-roll sensibility, and a look at the masculine energy behind the draggy glitter of rock.  I thought it was odd that the film was set in the present, more or less, given the wigs and the feel of the film.

B000067CPX|5.0|The Good:  The Chili Pep's are back with what some (read: me) might regard as their best album yet.  Incredible input from John Frusciante (sp?), the guitars are on a textural level perhaps better than the Edge's best work.  Anthony Keidis' lyrics are strong, as usual...and most of the songs intros are majestic...excellent.<br />The Bad:  Well, if you're a fan of Flea's poppy fretwork, there's less of it here, he seems to be going towards the song as a whole more than a standalone bass line in most of the songs.<br />The Ugly:  Flea...the man just ain't beautiful...

I can't stop listening to it.

B00003CXXP|1.0|I love Haley Joel Osment. I love Jude Law. And I consider Stanley Kubrick to be one of the most creative and brilliant Directors of all time but I can't fathom why A.I. was passed onto Spielberg. Perhaps with Kubrick's talents the movie would have been more interesting but with Spielberg talent it just has good film technology.<BR>The movie has some great illuminate visuals that keep you watching. The graphics in the film where very well done and do not appear fake.However that is where the compliments end.<br />A.I. essentially is the story of Pinnochio set in the future. The beginning of the movie is good.It focuses on a family adjusting to having a live in mecca (mechanical person).However the idea of someone replacing their child with one that will not grow is where the faults in the screenplay begin. How could parents accept a robot child that doesn't even blink,eat or bleed (however he can apparently breathe) which are normal,necessary and defining funtions of most living things and all humans.Furthermore, the family's real son becomes evil and vindictive towards the mechanical child. The living childs anger seemed unnecessary and appeared to be no more than a catalyst for the mechanical childs journey.<br />The rest of the film, which seemed to me to be an eternity, centered around the mechanical child trying to become a real boy and searching for the blue fairy, the character which made Pinnochio a real boy. <BR>Everything in the story seems forced. Jude Law's character seems to be thrown into the film for no reason but as another catalyst. In this case, to lead Haley's character to the blue fairy after which Law's character disappears. It seemed that the screen writers couldn't find a way to make it believable that the child character could travel on his own so they threw in a chance meeting so the child could meet with an adult. I suppose this was to show how human like he was because he needed the care of an adult however the joining of the characters seemed awkward and too fantastic. <BR>Because 95% of the movie focuses on the journey, the movie soon becomes a picture with drying paint as it's plot line. I can't tell you how many times I checked to see when it would end. I believe in always finishing a movie but this one was hard to swallow. It was just boring. You stopped caring whether or not he got home early in the film because everything was forced at you so violently, there was never room for you to develop your own feelings. The idea of him being like any real child was drilled into your head instead of allowing you to observe and draw your own conclusion. <BR>The ending was absolutely horrendous and should have been cut out plain and simply!!! !!<br />Perhaps the intentions where to make an Alice in Wonderland type film where the character meets many fantastic characters that effect the journey. However if this was intended to be a fairy tale, there should not have been human suffering and anger or the idea of big business men from New York taking over the world. That is all to real.<BR>In my opinion this movie was nothing more than a bunch of good ideas thrown into a film that absolutely could not connect the ideas so they used the classic road trip idea.You don't get more orignal than that??!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is one of &quot;the&quot; great films, but not necessarily one of the most &quot;liked&quot; films, of all time.  I'll admit, the first time I rented the film, I fell asleep, and it wasn't even competitive for the Oscar in 1941.  But, to say the movie is boring, or that you don't like it, is to miss the point.  Citizen Kane was not only a groundbreaking film for its technical aspects, but also for structure, story, and many other aspects.  Take a look at a pre-Citizen Kane movie, and then watch Citizen Kane.  Then, you can see the revolution that was Citizen Kane, both technically and artistically.  Movies like Memento and Vanilla Sky (as one reviewer prefers) wouldn't have been possible without the changes that Citizen Kane started over 60 years ago!  These things may not appear revolutionary to us today, but we need to watch the film in the context of 1941.  I've watched Citizen Kane a number of times over the years, and every time I come to admire it, and yes, even to like it, more.  I think you'll like it too, but you shouldn't expect to see things you've never seen before.  Today's better filmmakers have adopted many of the best principles used in Citizen Kane

0671004107|5.0|This is one of my all time favortie Sci-Fi books.  The characters are three deminsional and believable, and their problems are.  I'd almost call this book a cultural collage of society.  There is everything from history, to religion, to politics, to science, to humanity crammed into this book.  I also liked it because it seemed like the story could be going on now.  (Besides that Russia was called the Soviet Union).  it wasn't campy or futuristic like most Sci-Fi.  <br />The story is that Ellie Arroway finds messages from the planet Vega and the earth builds a machine to get to these aliens.  But there is so much more.  I couldn't possibly explain it all.  I love the imagery of human feeling Sagan gives you, and also the science in it is very strong, since its written by Carl Sagan.  Just read it!<br />Also, if you've seen the movie, don't think you've seen it all.  The movie only skimms the surface of this complex and enjoyable book.  I mean, you couldn't possibly cram that much meaning into a hour and a half movie!
B000021Y77|5.0|Furiously fast-paced and set to a throbbing techno soundtrack, Run Lola Run is shot in the energetic style in which music videos are filmed. In that, it reminded me of MTV, except with far more substance and underlying themes of fate and destiny. A young woman, Lola, receives a call from her boyfriend who is working for a drug lord. He lost the 100,000 marks he was supposed to deliver to him, and has only 20 minutes to come up with the money. Lola sprints off into a manic attempt to save him, and the plot halts. Then it shows three different outcomes, based on slight changes in Lola's path. Run Lola Run is one of the most original films I've ever seen, and Franka Potente is incredibly sexy in it. Five stars don't even serve this masterpiece justice. Highly recommended!
0380002930|5.0|I first read the book when I was 11 years old.  I am now 34 and have read it for the sixth time.  it left such an impression that I look foward to passing it on to my children.
6302158095|5.0|Fantasia is one of my favorite videos, and once I get my hands on the DVD version, it will also be my one of my favorite DVDs! I watched this movie countless times when I was a kid, but I recently saw it again and appreciated it even more. I've been playing classical piano since I was 4 (I'm 16 now) and since I know from experience that music can put images and stories in your head, I loved what they did with it. My favorite ones include the dancing fairy sequence, the appropriately scary &quot;Night On Bald Mountain&quot; animation, and Beethoven's pastoral symphony with the flying ponies, cupids, and centaurs.<br />Another thing I noted when I saw Fantasia was the year it was made in, along with the stunning animation. In the early 1940s, with the technology being what it was, each frame had to be individually drawn by the animator. The beautiful scenes flow by so effortlessly you'd never guess how much work went into each frame. When you think about it, it's mind-boggling. If you haven't seen Fantasia, you haven't lived. It's that simple. ;)
0780626494|5.0|This is a great movie to watch on a rainy day when you don't want to have to think about anything.  It is entertaining and will cheer you up.  I finally bought the DVD because I got sick of seeing the edited versions on cable.  It is definitely worth adding to your collection.
6304696566|5.0|\\"The Searchers\\" is an absolute must for John Wayne fans.  In a tie with \\"High Noon\\" for first place (in my book)...this movie is at the top of the heap for must see westerns.  Get the good popcorn out...turn the phone off...put the DVD in and get ready for one of the absolute best (if not the best) westerns ever made.  While the story is set in Texas...they actually shot the movie in Monument Valley.  The cinematography is outstanding.  They'll never top this one.
B00003XACV|5.0|I sort of consider this soundtrack a turning point for Thomas Newman. It's a score that marked the beginning of his new synthesized, new age, minimalist kind of composing. Although I really love his full orchestral traditional scores like 'Little Women', 'Meet Joe Black', and 'Oscar and Lucinda' there is something very refreshing about 'American Beauty'. There's a certain simple and clean sound to the music. He has a way of making a few notes stand all by themself, and yet evoke complex emotions. This is especially true for the theme presented in the 8th track 'American Beauty'. I could listen to that track on repeat all day and never tire of it. This music was perfect for the film. It complimented it so well, I hardly noticed it in several parts. It's got a great sort of rythme and beat that I think makes perfect car music. If you enjoy minimalist or new age kind of music, or are just a die hard fan of Thomas Newman, you are in for a treat!
0451160916|5.0|Now here we have a literary horror classic like Dracula. This is definitely gonna thrill you from beginning to end. This book is much like the haunting. This is my favorite book of all time and is very interesting in the fact that he uses character developement over having the action right away. This book has a shocker of an ending. The last 10 chapters are just one huge fright fest. One thing that is very interesting is the fact that this book also is about child abuse. In this book there is more psychological fear rather than thriller fear but there is a decent ammount of that to.
B000067CQK|5.0|Superb art.  Melancholy and hopeful at once.  One of a handful of truly timeless modern classics.  The best thing about this anniversary edition, aside from the great sound and packaging, is NOT putting the bonus tracks on the same disc as the original studio classic.  The extra tracks are terrific, but detracted greatly on the previous Rykodisc release with tacked on bonus material.  Elvis Costello's Rykodisc releases also suffered from out of place bonus tracks, and he, too, has wisely put the additional material on a separate c.d.   This release is cause for celebration.
B000002E5J|5.0|Creo este album por Shakira es muy bien- mejor que las otras albums &quot;Dnde...&quot; y &quot;Laundry Service&quot;. Compra ahora!<BR> Sorry if my Spanish is bad, but I felt that sentence summed up this album.<BR> It's an incredible journey into modern day and traditional latin pop music, and it's easily Shakira's best album to date.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|So often I am disappointed with sequels that just fail to match let alone better the original movie?  Only last week I watched Men In Black 2, and what a huge let-down that was. Blade 2 is a breath of fresh air.  This movie has retained all the qualities of the original and built on them to give us an action packed feast, and folks we are talking about serious action here, from beginning to end.  The martial arts scenes are on a par with The Matrix, simply stunning.  The special effects are beautifully flawless and the influence of the \\"Alien\\" movies is very evident. The costumes are just so coooool. But best of all, the storyline was an interesting development on the original and topped off an all round excellent sequel. Terrific.
0312265859|2.0|After devouring the first seven in the series, I tore open the eighth and sat down for what I just knew would be a laugh out loud but exciting read.  I was so disappointed in this one.  I only laughed out loud once, the ending was predictable and the bad guy was \\"been there, done that.\\"  So, Janet fans - - you'll like it because we all like Stephanie; but, when you're done you'll feel just a bit guilty that you want your money back.
B000066JES|3.0|Lets see 22 years of True Metal - absolutely!! Unfortunately there are only so many songs you can write about doom, glory, steel, blood, killing, dying, hell etc. - you get the picture without dropping the entertainment ball. <br />Just like hard rockers AC/DC this band are one horse (metal) trick and they need to back it up with excellent musical riffing/licks. Sure this album has he production we've come to expect from recent Manowar efforts but the sparkle isn't quite there. <br />Maybe its 'new-boy' Karl Logan's somewhat unimaginative soloing and riffs (compared to Louder than Hell: Stars = *****) this time round or maybe Eric's vocals, as powerful as ever, just aren't getting creating those ultimate choruses we love to chant. <br />Whatever the case new fans should look at 'Fighting the World' and 'Kings of Metal' for that classic Manowar fix. Only die hards should digest this one with fond memories of earlier efforts.<br />Play the best of it on TEN!!!
B000002TQV|3.0|I seriously don't know why this album gets so much slobbering praise. It's a pretty good guitar record, but nothing spectacular or even particularly distinct. That said, there's not one &quot;bad&quot; song on this album and I quite enjoy it while it's playing. And another pleasant surprise I got is that Thom Yorke (whom I consider to be one of the most overrated singers ever) actually sounds quite bearable and hasn't gone all whiny yet.
B0000508U6|5.0|With A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD nearly upon us, PARACHUTES tides us over with Coldplay's infectious melodic brit rock. The singles &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; were only hints of what PARACHUTES was to become...a well-crafted, polished debut with chiming, melodic guitar and singer Chris Martin's aching voice and moving lyrics. &quot;Don't Panic also proves to be a nice, pleasant song. <br />PARACHUTES didn't disappoint me, and many others as well. While most of us await the arrival of Coldplay's sophomore cd A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, tide yourself with PARACHUTES. It's well-crafted, polished Brit-pop that should catch your attention, even if you might think it won't.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Morning View is a great cd! Certainly you can't expect anything terrible to come out of incubus anyway, right? This album experiments with all different sounds and not one of them is bad. On the first track, &quot;Nice To Know You&quot;, Incubus proves they can rock with great guitar riffs and incredible vocals. &quot;Circles&quot; is kind of along the same lines. Track 3, the first single, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; has great lyrics and music to it that put anybody in a dazy sort of mood. &quot;Just A Phase&quot; is one of my favorites for it clever lyrics, AWESOME music and all around &quot;cool&quot;ness. &quot;11AM&quot; is so fun to sing to (like all of Incubus' music)...it's a great slower song and Brandon's vocals are really showcased quite nicely. The chorus is catchy as anything! &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; shakes the listener back up with it's rockin' sound..its loud, its angry, its good. Track 7, &quot;Mexico&quot; is a great acoustic song with absolutely beautiful lyrics. Boyd sings with such emotion that even the listener feels the significance of the song. &quot;Warning&quot; has a simple message &quot;don't ever let life pass you by&quot; and sends it packaged with great all-around sound. &quot;Echo&quot; is tied for my favorite song on this cd. It's so slow and gorgeous..i love it. &quot;Have You Ever&quot; brings that hard rock quality of incubus back full force as Brandon rants on about others &quot;trying to fit in his shoes&quot;! Track 11, &quot;Are You In&quot; totally rocks...it's cool..it's simple...its jazzy..and it makes me wanna dance everytime i hear it. &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; is my favorite &quot;loud&quot; song on this cd. The lyrics are wonderfully written. And now, for my other favorite track, &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;...I could listen to this song all day long! It is so beautiful and when you listen, all your anger fades because you feel like you are literally &quot;floating down the river&quot;. The sound is amazing on this track. It's truly one of a kind. Buy this album if you haven't already. It's excellent.
B000006NPY|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins, in my opinion, have had a nearly flawless career.  Although I was really dissapointed with Machina, all of their cd's really blew me away the moment i got them.  Adore is by far my favorite of all of them.  The single &quot;Perfect&quot; could bear the weight of all of their bad songs put together.  It is one of the most beautifal pop songs I have ever heard. Billy Corgan really had an amazing thing going when he wrote the songs for this album, it is unbelieveable.
0767802470|5.0|This fine movie is without a doubt, the best war film and certainly one of the top twenty films of all time. This movie made Wolfgang Peterson (The Perfect Storm) a sought after director and is an extremely well done war film from the German's point of view. I know some people who refuse to enjoy this spectacular film because it does indeed tell the entire film through the point of view of the Germans. I say to them, get a grip! These are people too and they were serving their country, like any American would do. The director's cut, at some 3 and 1/2 hours is long, but never boring! Get the Director's Cut and experience Das Boot like the great war film it was made to be.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Am I missing something here? Because I didn't think Darko was all that great. Not to be a jerk, but let me explain why, just to stimulate some discussion here.  It pains me to see a film so rife with typical \\"Hollywood-isms\\" get so much praise. Not that this is a horrible film, but I thought the dialogue was kinda transparent and rather pandering to \\"our\\" generation (those who came of age in the 80's) and I'm shocked how strongly some people feel about it. Honestly, I've only seen praise for this film, so I just felt I had to provide a different viewpoint, that's all. I eagerly await your hatemail!!
0385335482|5.0|This book was one of the best books I've read in a while. It made me feel less bad about how much I spend.
0446677450|5.0|I really can't understand the negative reviews of this book. Here is a man who lost a fortune, came  back and now is sharing his secrets. This book reminds me of a newer and much larger version of The Richest Man in Bablyon. Mr. Kiwosaki makes the book interesting with the story telling and it's fun to read as well as informative.The negative reviewers I suppose are the same people giving high reviews to those doom and gloom books that are coming out now enmasse and they probably spend most of their time watching the news and reading the newspapers and fil their minds with all of the rapes, murders, robberies and deaths. They are also probably unhappy with their lives and their boring jobs.I highly recommend Rich Dad, Poor Dad as well as Cash Flow Quadrant and Rich Dad's Guide to Investing. These books are urgently needed to nourish the minds of Americans who want more from life. But I guess Americans and readers all over the world allready know that because the books are still best sellers.Thank you Mr. Kiwosaki for sharing your knowledge. We needed this.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne's album Let Go has easily become my favorite CD. I'm not here to discuss her authenticity as a skater girl- this CD, on it's own, is an amazing effort and has shown that music can be unique and be real and still have mainstream appeal. I purchased this CD when i heard the song &quot;Complicated&quot;. I truly enjoyed that song and was expecting a lot from Avril. I was not disappointed. Here is a song by song account of what this album has to offer.<br />1.Losing Grip- A guitar driven pop song. It is something unusual to find in a teen pop artist. Lots of Avril's lyrics can apply to many different situations, that is what I like about this song. I like that it's angry but not to the point of Alanis, there is still a sweetness, she's angry but she's over it and will survive.<br />2.Complicated- I'm not going to go into detail explaining this song, we've all heard it or you wouldn't be reading this review. A very melodic song with a catchy chorus.<br />3.Sk8ter Boi- Avril's truly punk song. The story is about a skater boy who likes one of the popular girls, she rejects him even though she likes him (peer pressure). Later he has success on MTV and Avril is his girlfriend. Musically is could have been done by a group like Blink 182.<br />4.I'm With You- not a bad song but not that good. this is the reason it's only 4 stars and not five. it's a slow song but i didn't think it was that great. the lyrics are alright and the melody is fine. nothing special<br />5.Mobile- one of the best songs on the album. has a good folk kinda sound. with the guitars. there is a very catchy chorus. the songs is about changes which we can all relate to.<br />6.Unwanted- a rock sounding song. Another song that also applies to so many different situations. I love how this song sound so loud and you can just picture is being played live. Another great song from this album. I love what Avril does with her voice, it sounds so pure and every word is so strong and so serious. amazing song.<br />7.Tomorrow- A very beautiful slow song. Simply about not being ready for something today but tomorrow is another day. I think that the message is good for everyone and can apply to so many situations. It's about being true to yourself and not doing what other people want you to until you are ready.<br />8.Anything But Ordinary- Most people don't want to be average and this song is about not being average. That is a great message. Life isn't about fitting in but doing your own thing. Great beat, an uptempo song. You will love it and be singing along with the song before you know it.<br />9.Things I'll never say- this song is about having so much inside that you can't say to the person even if you want to. I can personally relate so this has become my favorite song. A great beat and chorus that is catchy. This is where Avril's song writting skills excel.<br />10.My World- A song about the place where Avril grew up. It applies to so many aspects of average american suburbia (even though she is from canada). It's the mindset of those who grew up in suburban areas. A nice song. What I like is that it is truly authentic, this is the story of avril's life.<br />11. Nobody's Fool- Avril sorta rap/talks the verses of this song. I don't like that part to much but I love the chorus, it is so catchy and has a message- do what you want and don't change just because someone else wants you to. This is what Avril did, she didn't become Britney Spears but became her own person.<br />12. Too Much Too Ask- a song about a relationship that didn't work out. she says &quot;you can't see the world through a mirror&quot; which is so true. i think it has a similar theme to the song &quot;complicated&quot; but has a completely different feel musically. I really love this song. great chorus.<br />13. Naked- it's about being vulnerable and learning to be vulnerable to the people you trust. a very pretty song and i believe it makes a perfect end to this album. Very true lyrics. it'sgood to listen to the words because you can learn some valuable lessons about becoming who you are.<br />Avril Lavigne has an amazing voice and can write great songs. I hope that she has a lot of success in the future because she is very talented. I suggest that you purchase this album because it is worth every penny. thank yous good to listen to the words because you can learn some valuable lessons about becoming who you are.<br />Avril Lavigne has an amazing voice and can write great songs.

B00003CX9Q|1.0|Why on earth is the ORIGINAL version of thi film not on this DVD?  I was greatly dismayed by the absurd changes made to this brilliant and unforgettable film for its recent theatrical reissue--I would have hoped that all the negative audience response would have at least ensured a first-class release of the original theatrical cut on this new DVD...WRONG!  Bad choice by Universal, and one which I hope will be quickly rectified.
6305364648|5.0|From the beginning of the film, True Lies is already  distinguished. Its development is smooth and exciting. It is filled with imagination.<br />It is a great movie which I should recommend to everyone.
B000066C6Z|5.0|From the wacky Zucker brothers that brought you the Airplane and Naked Gun spoofs, we now have a total laugh fest with Top Secret.  This movie sits right there at the top when it comes to sight gags, one-liners and a hilarious script.<br />What do you get when you combine an American rock and roll star with totally inept Nazi's, resistance fighters named after French foods, a fight scene in a saloon under the water, and more comedy mayhem than you can handle?  You've got a 3 ring circus of total insanity that never quits!<br />If you're a fan of any spoof film (Naked Gun, Hot Shots, Airplane, etc.), this is definitely the movie for you and it will not disappoint.  Just make sure you pay attention during the movie because there is a lot of subtle but hilarious gags and props in the background while the main action is happening.<br />It's fantastic to see this movie finally make it to DVD.  Some of the nice things on the disc are the the commentary by the directors, the 5.1 Surround sound track, alternate scenes, and storyboard compilations.  Highly recommended and enjoyable!
B00005ATQF|5.0|I say \\"one of\\" because all of his movie's are so damn good.  FMJ is quite different, however.  While most of his films are slow moving, this film gets right to the point.  The actors play their roles well, especially R. Lee Ermey, who is actually a real Gunnery Sergeant.  This film is very dialogue driven though, so don't expect much use of the surround sound speakers.  And for those who are whining about \\"NO LETTERBOX IT IS SO STUPID TO SEE IN PANSCAN,\\" keep in mind the film was shot with a camera negative of 4:3, and it is what Kubrick intended.  All the theater displays had to be cut down to fit the 1.85:1 screen.  So, there's no information missing in the fill frame (4:3) format.  So, buy it.  It's guarenteed you'll love it.
0316666343|5.0|Sebold's novel opens swiftly with the details of Susie Salmon's murder in the first chapter.  Within 30 minutes of beginning the novel I had tears in my eyes and was immediately hooked, wanting to learn more about Susie, whether her murderer would be caught, and what her heaven was like.  I liked that Susie's heaven was similar to what I had envisioned it to be and the thought of a narrator from heaven actually was very credible.  The book does take an odd and sudden twist toward the end, but I suppose it was necessary to resolve the plot.  I highly recommend this book as it will make a great summer read and the story is so interesting that you will read it very quickly.
0060975768|5.0|Absolutely the best military book I have ever read! Would highly recommend to anyone.
0316776963|4.0|In this book, the reader can empathize with the difficulties children and adults have, while learning to speak correctly.  Mr. Sedaris starts with \\"s\\" difficulties, and after conquering that, continues on with his life to encounter drug problems and the French language.<br />The humor Mr. Sedaris displays while painting vivid pictures of his father, who has unique shopping and eating habits, and his boyfriend, who grew up in Africa, are very entertaining.  I especially like the descriptions of Africa that he tells, making them sound as if they were his own memories, rather than his boyfriend's.  <br />Overall, I found the book to be very good, but enjoyed some parts more than others.
0316776963|4.0|There are moments in this book where you'll have to stop and catch your breath.  If I felt the need to read aloud from the book I found myself giving pause to gather the strength needed to continue on.  The stories in this book are, in my opinion, lighter than those one would find in &quot;Naked&quot;.  The style is the same but the laughs come much more often.
B000002UCN|5.0|I did not realize until after George Harrison died, that his mustic was some of my favorite Beatle music. For some reason, I thought a few of his songs were John Lennon's. Until I bought this CD I did not give him the credit he deserved. Sorry about that George, better luck in the after life.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I bought this album(yes, I bought the LP, not the CD, they do make a domestic vinyl of this)because I liked No Such Thing.I knew going in that it would have a lot of acoustic stuff, but I was expecting real folky slow stuff along the lines of Sarah Mclachlan. I was real surprised to hear stuff like Neon, where he really shows what an accomplished guitarist he is. The best song is The Great Indoors-I can't stop playing it-reminds me of In A Daydream by the Freddie Jones Band. This is roots rock with a tad of alternative mixed in.Buy the LP (not CD), enjoy the acoustics analog style on some 3 way Polk speakers, and you will hear the way this album was intended to be heard-free from DIGITAL.But DO record it to your hard drive to have a cd for the car.No Cd Changer should be on random setting without this.
B00005Y228|4.0|I bought this CD primarily for the &quot;Can't get you out of my head&quot;<BR>song, and expecting one or two another good songs. Instead I found all most all of the songs were very good.
B00000IN5G|1.0|This Whole cd lacks focus towards music and just sounds [terrible].
B000063V8R|5.0|From the beginning of season three of ST:TNG,it's obvious that the show was coming from under it's spin-off banner and became its own show.<BR>  The writing was excellent,the characters were more fleshed out with room for growth.Gates McFadden returned as Dr Beverly Crusher,finally restoring the magic chemestry between the cast.<BR>  The best episodes included The Survivors,Who Watches The Watchers,The Bonding,Booby Trap,The Enemy,Yesterdays Enterprise,The Offspring,Sins Of The Father,Sarek,and of course,The Best Of Both Worlds pt 1,regarded as TNG's finest moment.<BR> If you avoided the first two seasons,then this season three is the one to start your TNG DVD collection
B00005QG9J|5.0|I love this cd it has the perfect mix of hard and soft rock i had to make a copy of it so i could leave in my car while the real one was in my stereo.
0972169504|5.0|A truly entertaining portrayal of graduate life.  Anybody who's in grad school can find at least one strip (if not whole sections of the book) which fits them to a T.  You find yourself laughing at just how true it is, and at the same time thinking it's all too warped to be real.  I enjoyed every page!<br />A word of caution -- this is a very effective procrastination tool and may inspire cynicism (but that's not bad, is it?...)
B00005JKNF|2.0|PROS:Great cinematography, sets, and cast!<br />CONS: Boring plot and way too long!
0140186409|2.0|Steinbeck is not an great author. Rather, he is an author who knows how to pick his topic and manipulate his readers. As in his other well known novels/novellas such as \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"The Pearl\\", Steinbeck had again chosen a innocent good (the Okies) struggling against a unlimited evil (the California captalists). To give credit where credit is due, Steinbeck indeed does potray the hardships of the dustbowl sharecroppers vividly and at the same time, tells us of the awsome collective powers of humanity and society via Jim Casy. Unfortunately, the literary value of \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" ends up just about there. As Steinbeck repeatedly stresses the Joad Family's mistreatment, he does not explain nor justify why the so called \\"big greedy captalist\\" exploit the \\"impoverished sharecroppers\\". Furthermore, Steinbeck does not offer us a fair resolution, he simply and conviently leaves the readers hanging in the end without new revelations. Think of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\", we learn that sometimes the society is filled injustice, however, in the end, all people, white or black, rich or poor are inherently good. Sadly, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" fails to transcend its melodramatics. In essence, like a teenager's unwarranted complaint against his or her \\"phony\\" society which cannot be called literature, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" does not deserve the label \\"a great American novel\\".
0805017445|5.0|When I saw that you were offering this book for sale I felt I should write that this was my children's all-time favourite book when they were ages two to five. I am the mother of eight children who are now between the ages of nine to twenty-seven so I got a lot of use out of this book. In fact I had to buy a replacement copy for our two youngest children because we wore out the first one. Now that copy rests unused on our library shelves but I know someday soon I'll be using it again for our grandchildren. If someone were to ask me to recommend books for their young children this would be the first one on my list. It is simply so much fun for both the children and the parent to read together.
B0000640VO|1.0|I must have missed something somewhere.  I expected a &quot;movie.&quot;  You know, where you are entertained by an uninterrupted, captivating, interesting story with a plot.  I bought the DVD...and I am going to try to return it.  I could not watch even 20% of this thing.  I took the first disk out of the player and put in the second one, searching for the one with the &quot;movie.&quot;  All I saw was narrated scenes with someone speaking French in the background.  Also, I had to have the subtitle on to see what else was being said.  <br />I don't know if I didn't watch the thing long enough, if I got some weird DVD cut, or if I just don't get it.  There is no way I can call this thing a movie, you know, &quot;movie&quot; (&quot;...as to create the illusion of motion and continuit&quot;).  I did learn one thing . . . I will NEVER buy any French movie again.
B00005JLDW|2.0|There was no point in coming up with a plausible biological reason for Dragons \\"breathing\\" fire if nothing else in the script after the opening segment was believable.\\"Atlanta native\\" has listed some of the more obvious plot holes in another review.Sadly the most interesting part of the script is the  portion they chose to do as a series of Magazine and Newspaper clipings rather than as the movie.Even the CGI dragons, while   possibly well designed, are poorly rendered.Most of the time they are obscured by clouds , flames, or camera moves.If you like dragons wait for the video.You'll be able to fast foward through the ludicrous dialogue.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Superb!!  The only thing better than a good movie is a good movie based on true fact.  The movie story was good.  The fact that it really happened made it great.  It was interesting, captivating, and just plain enjoyable to watch.  It is easy (if not desirable) to envision yourself as being the professor, to imagine possessing such intellect.  Best of all, the conclusion won't let you down.
0789723107|5.0|Creating an effective Web site is easy with this book. Krug takes you step by step through the process and helps you avoid all the dumb decisions that make so many Web sites annoying and difficult to navigate. His breezy, friendly style makes this book easy to read, even for graphic designers. (Sorry, I didn't mean that.) <br />Seriously, everyone who designs Web sites needs to read this book. I've brought it to work (I work in a marketing communications and design company) and shared it with my colleagues. They liked it too.<br />If you want to create more effective and successful Web sites, you oughta read this book.

B000065U1N|2.0|This is probably the most realistic depiction of war I've seen.  The explaination of the battle plan was clear enough, but after things start to go wrong, it was easy to lose track of the action.  Blood and gore is abundant.  There is little character development, hence it is difficult to truly care about any of them.  It was not my idea of a fun evening.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Based on the classic sci-fi novel by H.G. Wells, &quot;The Time Machine&quot; stars Guy Pearce (&quot;Rules of Engagement,&quot; &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;) in the role of scientist and inventor, Alexander Hartdegen, who is determined to prove that time travel is possible.  His determination is turned to desperation by a personal tragedy that now drives him to want to change the past.  Testing his theories with a time machine of his own invention, Hartdegen is hurtled 800,000 years into the future, where he discovers that mankind has divided into the hunter...and the hunted<BR>The film is a little confusing. I think it answers most of the <BR>questions we want to know, but it does this very quickly, too quickly in my opinion. If you're not listening intently at all times, you might miss some significant material as I did. I am not quite sure how the Morlocks came to be, although I think I was told. I'm not completely sure what happened to the moon in 2037, although I think I was told. Worst of all, I was never able to fully comprehend the answer to Alexander's troubling question, although I know the story did answer it, briefly<br />fans of the original film may be angry that anyone would dare mess with their movie, but I'm here to report that I enjoyed this version.
B000002GB4|5.0|For the debut of Tommy Shaw, I thought this cd couldn't have been better.  Madmoiselle is the best song on the album.  I have been a long time Styx fan and I'd have to say that this is the band at its best.  If you want a great Classic Rock cd, buy this one, you WON'T be wasting your money!!
B000020617|4.0|Rocking from the start, Foo Fighters just go all out on this one. Not being a hard core fan I was impressed by the energy and the power this band puts forth. Each song has a driving beat that can be exhausting sometimes, but I admire their willingness to return again and again to the primal force of rock. Talented and tuneful, Foo Fighters provide the listner with straight ahead rock and roll; a commodity that is getting harder to find all the time.
B00005JL1C|3.0|Some Kind Of Wonderful remains one of my favorite 80s movies. Not quite up there with Pretty In Pink, but nonetheless very entertaining. Eric Stolz is great as the loner Keith and I totally sympathize with Mary Stuart Masterson's Watts. The girl has it bad and she's only seen as a friend. She suffers from the \\"Ducky\\" syndrome a la Pretty In Pink. Lea Thompson is also very appealing in this role. Awesome music!! I especially love the song playing during the scene where Keith and Watts \\"Kiss\\" in the garage. Can't wait for the dvd! :)
0393317552|4.0|This is an excellent book in the sense that it imparts<BR>important information about why western culture dominates the<BR>world.

B00005JKOI|4.0|Well finally we are getting this movie on Dvd! I can't wait to check it out in all it's widescreen glory. I saw this movie in the theater when I was 10 years old and I loved it! I just swooned for Andrew McCarthy back then. Jon Cryer is excellent!! He makes me laugh so hard in this flick. \\"Blane?! His name is BLANE? That's not a name, it's a major appliance!\\" Yeah and uh what exactly kind of name is Ducky? LOL, awesome awesome movie. This is one of the examples of why of love 80s teen movies. God Bless John Hughes! :)
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is one of the best funniest and heartwarming animated movies to come out in a long time.  The story is simple but engaging and the characters are extremely likeable.  Some parts dragged a little or was just too frantic.  It could've use more character development moments.  But overall, it was very entertaining for both adults and kids.  And isn't little \\"Boo\\" the most adorable thing ever!?!?!  The ending made everyone in theatre just go \\"awwwwwwwwwww[...]\\", literally!  It just gives you that warm fuzzy feeling inside.  Way better than Shrek, which I thought was highly overrated.
B000068PQ0|5.0|The Flaming Lips rule.  <BR>Of course this album probably won't strike you as much as the Soft Bulletin, but it's awesome nontheless.  I agree with almost everybody's review so far, the only song I'd say is a real mistake is Yoshimi, Pt 2, song #4.  <BR>Other than that, it's great.  If you're tyring (like me) to turn on folks to the Flaming Lips, this might be the first album to use.  My girlfriend used to hate them, especially in the \\"Hit to death..\\" stage, but she now FINALLY recognizes their genius.  Can you believe I can finally put in a Lips album and NOT have to turn it down? <BR>Which reminds me, we just saw their show at the Knitting Factory (and the Amoeba in-store in LA), and THEY ARE THE BEST live show ever.  Blows away ANY band you've ever seen. <BR>Isn't it wild that you can go to a show and see little kids and grandparents enjoying music?  <BR>Buy this album!  Don't expect the Soft Bulletin, or anything else.
B00003CXTF|1.0|This movie could have been awesome. The battle scenes are incredible,but the movie is murdered by an over elabrote and drawn out love story that adds about an hour and a half to the movie that could have been used to explore other issues like, THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR FOR INSTANCE!
B00003CXQX|5.0|It was a very good movie.  Capturing the funnies and the seriousness of people trying to kill the king.  It isn't very serious however it is a very good movie.
B00004UEIF|5.0|This is a genuine classic. But, be forewarned it may spoil you because the level of individual musicianship and the group interplay of the three musicians is at a level rarely equalled by other jazz (or any style) musicians. Its companion volume, &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard,&quot; which focuses more on bassist Scott LaFaro, is its equal. Evans' touch, sense of rhythm, intelligence and his long, flowing melodic lines have been better documented by others than I can. And LaFaro's inventiveness and technique have, too. But, I find few people talk about Paul Motian on drums. His is some of the best drumming ever committed to cd. He is so much more than a timekeeper, he is a melodist and an equal member of the trio. He is endlessly creative, in tune with the other musicians, mindful of the ebb and flow of the music and plays in the context of the other's contributions and the song at hand. (Compare to the drumming on Rubalcaba's &quot;The Blessing&quot; which is often brilliant, but often too busy or loud for the context he's playing in.) Nobody uses brushes as well as Motian. (Though the style of music and drumming is very different, I find Motian the equal of Art Blakey in Monk's trio recordings--&quot;Work&quot; and &quot;Nutty&quot;-- in that the drummer is not subserviant to the gifted pianist, but makes him even better by his level of musicianship and inventiveness. Both Motian and Blakey prove that drumming can be about much more than rhythm but about music.) Many people talk about the fact that this is an ensemble in which all three members solo, play lead and push the envelope. The best proof of that is that I find myself listening differently to the same cut at different times. Sometimes I focus on Evans, sometimes on LaFaro and sometimes on Motian. In different listenings I find myself thinking that the real leader is a different member of the trio. This is one of those cd's I listnen to late at night and find myself using the back control to listen again to a phrase, or how one musician plays off another's ideas, or just to hear again a stunningly beautiful or inventive phrase. I find, even after 20 years of listening to this music (on vinyl and cd) that I still find new wonders and delights. Warning, the level of musicianship, interplay, creativity will spoil you. No one plays like Evans,(except imiatators) and few have found &quot;sidemen&quot; equal to the task of matching them.
B0000640VO|4.0|First off, my wife and I have a long standing rivalry when it comes to &quot;Chick Flicks&quot; and &quot;Manly&quot; movies...<br />So when I saw Amelie on a plane, I thought I would surprise her with a great film that she would enjoy and I could gain some brownie points (even though I too enjoyed the movie immensely).<br />Without insulting the &quot;purists&quot; among those who may read this, I have to say that - for initial viewing - I think the lack of English dubbing on the DVD distracts from the movie.  One of the greatest things about Amelie is the visuals and the creative images in the film: its simply wonderful to look at.  I found myself spending half the time reading and, unfortunately, missing the visuals.  That was fine for me, as I had already &quot;seen&quot; it, but I don't think my wife got the same pleasure, though she too enjoyed the film.<br />That said, I still highly recommend the film, but think that it may be best enjoyed after multiple viewings, when you know the story and can focus on the wonderful visuals.
0451528018|4.0|I just read Laurie King's wonderful &quot;The Beekeeper's Apprentice&quot; in which she writes her take on Sherlock Holmes. That just wasn't enough Holmes for me, though; so I picked up Doyle's only Sherlock Holmes novel to read. I had somehow missed it, though I've read so many of the original tales. I expected this to be good and it was.<br />In &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&quot; Holmes and Watson are confronted with an interesting case. On the moors of Wales, the Baskerville family has long told of a legendary hound who's purpose is to plague the family. It has always been considered only a legend, but then Charles Baskerville is killed, and it could be by that hound. It seems someone wants to be rid of the Baskervilles, and the heir of Charles Baskerville is in danger on the moors. Watson and Holmes, of course set out to solve the mystery.<br />The novel is a success. It is short with easily flowing prose. The case is classic Holmes; it's always intriguing. The atmosphere of the moor Doyle creates is compelling. The novel remains fairly intense until the climactic end. There's not much bad to say about it, except maybe a little more Holmes and a little less Watson would have been nicer. But overall, this is a fun and worthy read.
B000067CQK|5.0|This is one of the most groundbreaking albums of all time. It is a must have for any Bowie fan, or even anyone who is into rock. It paves the way for music as it is today. A total masterpeice.
B000002LFZ|5.0|Fleetwood Mac was the best thing about late '70s rock 'n' roll, and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; does hit all the high points.  (My only quarrel is that it overlooked &quot;Monday Morning.&quot;)  However, Fleetwood Mac's late '70s work - &quot;Fleetwood Mac,&quot; &quot;Rumours,&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot; - are really too essential to sample through a greatest hits collection.  Buy this disc to get the best of their '80s work, but buy their late '70s masterpieces as well.
0688170528|5.0|A friend and I were looking for a book similar to Sparks. He found this and so we each bought a copy. We couldnt put it down. 'The Pact' captures you from the very first page. Just when you think you have it figured out BAM there is another twist. It says Love Story in the title, but this is not your typical love story. This is the story of two young lovers who were born and raised together. Destined for each other. Until one evening something happens that changes both of there lives forever. Shes dead and he is accused of killing her. but what really happened that night in November at the carousel. You think you know? Read it to find out.
B000002KOO|5.0|With &quot;Then Play On,&quot; Peter Green and Fleetwood Mac transform their early white-bread British blues into a beautiful sound all their own.  This is electric guitar rock that is at once &quot;pretty&quot; and soothing, and at the same time more passionate and intense than anything cut by Pete Townsend or Eric Clapton.  &quot;Oh Well&quot; is the perfect example:  it starts out as a hard rocking blues with a unique guitar riff, more intense than any of the Elmore James soundalikes on early Mac albums, then closes with an extended coda that is at once soothing and yet just as emotional as the opening blues.  (In fact, &quot;Oh Well&quot; predates, and is actually superior to, Eric Clapton's very similarly structured Derek &amp; the Dominoes masterpiece &quot;Layla&quot;.)<br />While many listeners feel that Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac and its later incarnation with Lindsay Buckingham are completely different (and generally like one but not the other), &quot;Then Play On&quot; demonstrates the similarity (or continuity) between the two eras of Fleetwood Mac.  Peter Green and Lindsay Buckingham both have a unique and beautiful electric guitar technique - retaining the power of the electric while playing it more like a classical instrument.  And, both &quot;Then Play On&quot; and later Fleetwood Mac display a sublety and a carefully nuanced sound that is quietly intense - as immediate and compelling as the best rock, while avoiding its tendency toward crudity and sheer noise.<br />&quot;Then Play On&quot; is, quite simply, a masterpiece of British rock - and rock music in general.
B00006AULI|4.0|I'm a huge horror fan, but lately I've been rather disappointed by most of the films I've seen in this genre...    All I can say is, wow!  I was very pleased with this movie.  It's disturbing, unsettling, and scary, and it stays with you after you've turned it off, like a good horror movie should.  There's a particularly creepy scene with a young worker in the basement...  <br />There is very little blood in this movie, but it scares you all the same, which takes talent.  The terror in this movie is more atmospheric and psychological than physical.  If you crave beheadings and gore, this is probably not the movie for you.  However, if you just want a genuinely scary experience that will leave you feeling thoroughly unsettled, then watch this movie.  The beginning is a little slow, but as the movie progresses, you get more and more ensnared by it, like the worker who stumbles across recordings of a therapy session between a doctor and patient with multiple personalities and then can't stop listening, even making excuses to sneak away and listen.  The film unfolds as the tape does, and the movie ends with the ninth therapy session (hence the name).   <br />I was expecting a typical workers-trapped-in-abandoned-mental-hospital film, but \\"Session 9\\" is anything but typical.  There are plenty of twists and turns in this movie, and you'll find yourself confused one minute, and then thinking you have it figured out the next, only to discover you were wrong.  \\"Session 9\\" breaks away from the cookie cutter mold of many modern horror movies, and the result is, for the most part, terrific.
B000002L9Y|3.0|&quot;Tango&quot; is Fleetwood Mac's last studio recording with pop genius Lindsay Buckingham.  Unfortunately, however, it is not one of Buckingham's better efforts.  We are now clearly in the 1980s, and synthesized sounds make their unwelcome presence felt.  Furthermore, Lindsay's songwriting inspiration appears to be wearing off.  Gone is the strange but wonderful latter-day Brian Wilson beauty; instead, his efforts just sound quirky.  In short, it's best to avoid this disc.  Fans would be better served by getting the best &quot;Tango&quot; tracks on the &quot;Greatest Hits.&quot;
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Do you like dancing?  Do you like laughing?  Do you like romance?  *Strictly Ballroom* is a classic oddball romantic comedy, inspired by the true world of strict regulations in ballroom dancing.  A young man must choose between doing steps that are &quot;strictly ballroom&quot; or dancing his own steps...with a girl he will come to love.  The dance scenes and the love story between Scott and Fran are great. Watch Scott's dad--he has a few surprises up his sleeve.  A++ movie.  The extra short documentary on ballroom dancing on the DVD is worth a watch, too.
B000002KD5|5.0|While &quot;Rumours&quot; is often considered Fleetwood Mac's masterpiece, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; (the first album featuring Buckingham and Nicks) is actually superior, featuring just as many FM radio classics, a less-acidic tone, and just plain catchier songs.  Lindsay Buckingham displays all of his pop brilliance on &quot;Monday Morning,&quot; and all of his paranoia on &quot;World Turning&quot; and &quot;I'm So Afraid.&quot;  Stevie Nicks offers her biggest hit (&quot;Rhiannon&quot;) and her best song (&quot;Landslide&quot;).  And Christine McVie is well represented by what may be her greatest pop masterpieces (&quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;).<br />&quot;Rumours&quot; is great - but this is better.
0451169514|4.0|\\"IT\\" is, bar none, the best Stephen King novel I've ever read.<br />Since most readers are probably at least somewhat familiar with the book, I'll briefly say that \\"IT\\" is about a group of eleven-year-olds menaced by a monster (also called IT) on a child-killing rampage, which takes the shape of whatever will scare the victim most -- then, the same people reunite in their hometown as adults, to confront the thing in hopes of defeating IT once and for all.<br />At the very least, the book is jim-dandy entertainment, a riveting page-turner.  The writing is Stephen King (admittedly not everyone's cup of hemlock) at the top of his form; the idea of a Mobius strip story/ies is clever; the stories themselves are both gripping and skillfully interwoven; the thrills and scares (and gross-outs, of course) come without letup; and the plot, though based on a simplistic and slender premise (Good Guys confront Bad Guy; who will prevail?), is a quite satisfactory cliff-hanger...<br />But what really puts \\"IT\\" severed head and shoulders above King's other books is the authenticity of the emotion.  \\"IT\\" is the Stephen King novel with a heart -- a bloody, still-beating heart ripped out of its owner's chest -- but a heart nonetheless.<br />What distinguishes King's books in general from those of, say, Dean Koontz or John Coyne; and \\"IT\\" from the more mediocre of King's books; is the sensitivity and compassion (odd words for King, but in this context, I think they're fitting) with which he writes about his characters.  They're kids (at least throughout the majority of the book), but they're also real people -- individuals with thoughts and feelings and likes and dislikes and hobbies and ambitions and (usually dysfunctional) families.  We care about them.  We laugh when Richie tries to charm the ticket taker at the movies.  We quail when Beverly's irrational father rages at her.  Our hearts ache with pity for Ben when he denies writing the haiku because, \\"if a fat kid like me wrote a poem to a girl, she'd probably laugh herself sick\\".  And when they successfully stand up for themselves (as in the rockfight scene), we stand up and cheer for them.  They're brave, they're flawed, they're sweet, they're smartassed, they're goofy.  The kids' part of the story would make a great Spielberg movie!<br />King takes the readers into the world of his book in a way that's nothing short of phenomenal.  We're transported back to middle school days:  the sights, the sounds, the smells; the teachers, the classmates; watching the clock on the last day of school, the barrel of sawdust that the custodian sprinkles on the floor before sweeping (which I'd completely forgotten about until the moment I read that!).  King remembers it all, and evokes it vividly here.<br />IT is a thoroughly fascinating and horrifying nemesis (especially in ITs werewolf and hobo forms; others, such as the bird, are less effective) -- but as is often the case in King's novels, the human monsters are by far the most frightening and best portrayed.  Brutish school bully Henry Bowers, vacuous and crazy Patrick Hockstetter, the distressingly numerous abusive fathers (Beverly Marsh's and Eddie Corcoran's and Henry Bowers', and I'm probably forgetting someone), the adult Beverly's abusive husband -- all are crueler, creepier, and more malevolent than any supernatural creature could possibly be.  The section with the gay-bashing teenage hoodlums was also superb -- perfectly capturing every detail of the wretched boys' speech, clothes, and homelife -- rendering them empathetic without mitigating their loathsomeness.<br />There's also quite a bit of humor (thank goodness).  Richie, the class clown, provides many of the \\"chucks\\", but most everybody gets their moment in the spotlight.  Eddie Kaspbrak is usually meek and depressed, but when his overprotective mother won't let him take gym, he sardonically wishes she could see how fast he runs with IT chasing him.  The scene where Henry's sidekick tries to explain that he can't join the gang for bullying and mayhem the next day because he's got a job delivering the local \\"Weekly Shopper\\" newspaper was hilarious, though in a dark way.  King's gift for language, and memory for how childhood really feels, combine to recapture the humor of the days when the very word \\"girdle\\" was enough to reduce everyone to hysteria.<br />A few quibbles:  First, the book's supposed climax and denouement were disappointing -- muddled and uninteresting -- a real letdown, especially after eleven hundred pages on a roller coaster.  Second, the Corcoran boy (Dorsey's brother) should have been named Jack, Charlie, Bob, etc.; introducing a new \\"Eddie\\" after we'd already read several hundred pages containing a main character with the same name created needless confusion.  Third, some gross-outs were overdone.  Over-the-top descriptions are part of King's charm, but the book was already well-written and interesting enough that including the literary equivalent of plastic doggie-doo detracted from the overall quality.  Fourth, the editing is downright sloppy in spots, e.g., \\"this fact or concept or whatever it was to him\\" when \\"this concept\\" was all that was needed; or when Richie is Catholic on one page and Methodist on another.  And finally, the scene in the tunnel was rather dismaying.  It's King's book; he can put all the sex he wants in it -- between consenting adults.  A scene depicting group sex with an eleven-year-old girl is a bit outside my comfort zone.<br />Those considerations aside, though, \\"IT\\" is King's best book, hands down. Highly recommended to all King fans -- \\"IT\\" is scary, sad, funny, heart-tugging, rousing, compulsively readable -- all the reasons why Stephen King *has* fans.  If you've never read him, this is the book to start with (sure, it's a 500-pound gorilla -- but there's no such thing as a short, palatable Stephen King novel suitable for newbies).  Amazing what the man is capable of doing when he rolls up his sleeves and gives it his best shot.
B000002KKC|5.0|Fleetwood Mac was one bright spot in the otherwise bleak musical landscape of the late 1970s.  &quot;Tusk&quot; was one reason why.  It may not have the radio hits of &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and &quot;Rumours,&quot; but this double-LP is equally packed with great hooks, beautiful pop melodies, strong playing, and Lindsay Buckingham's unique genius.  &quot;Tusk,&quot; in short, is every bit as essential as its two classic predecessors.
B000067CPX|5.0|It amazes me that a band like the Chili Peppers can continue with every new album to grow better and better musically. &quot;By the Way&quot; is by far the most theme-matic of all of they're albums, therefore you should not anticipate it to be just like &quot;Californication.&quot; &quot;By the Way&quot; could be described as a Blue period, much like the famous artists Blue Period. The cover art for &quot;By the Way&quot; expresses just that with it's Pastel colors and depressing nature. But don't take that the wrong way, this album is the furthest thing from depressing, it is merely just more melodic and crafty. The use of Beach Boy esque harmonies on practically every song excels the song's credability greatly. &quot;Dosed&quot; the sadest song on the album is also the most beutiful... a true masterpiece. &quot;This is the Place&quot; will most likely be a huge hit, as well as &quot;On Mercury.&quot; This album has something for eveyone and will be held as a true classic for generations to come. If you can appreciate good music, you will not be disappointed in this one.
B000002KLZ|4.0|&quot;Fleetwood Mac Live&quot; is not a bad album.  Lindsay Buckingham's take on Peter Green's &quot;Oh Well,&quot; in particular, is almost worth the price of admission.  However, the album's sound quality is uneven, and unlike &quot;The Dance,&quot; it offers no new interpretations of Fleetwood Mac classics.  This is one for Fleetwood Mac completists only.
B00000DFTG|4.0|Black Sabbath sounds amazingly good considering the age of the band members.  The material from their first four albums: Black Sabbath, Paranoid, Master of Reality and Volume IV is excellent -in some cases improving upon the studio versions.  Tony Iommi is especially good - 70's riff icon meets heavy metal pyrotechnicist.  The only disappointment is in the later Black Sabbath material. &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot;, one of their signature songs, is missing entire verses - if Ozzy was not up to the vocal challenge then the song should have been dropped rather than chopped up.  &quot;Spiral Architect&quot; and &quot;Dirty Women&quot; also sound forced - as if Ozzy included them reluctantly in the set.  Until someone puts out a good modern remastered set of Black Sabbath's original studio output, Reunion is the best way to hear the classic songs played by the original band.
B000002KGT|5.0|Fleetwood Mac was one bright spot in the otherwise grim and depressing musical landscape of the late 1970s.  &quot;Rumours&quot; is one reason why.  Lindsay Buckingham's pop-rock genius is in full display on &quot;Second Hand News,&quot; &quot;Never Going Back Again,&quot; and &quot;Go Your Own Way,&quot; as is Christine McVie's on the infectious &quot;Don't Stop&quot; (the Clinton campaign's efforts notwithstanding) and &quot;You Make Lovin' Fun.&quot;  Fleetwood Mac, quite simply, made the late '70s fun.
6304466498|5.0|A huge spoof on Star Wars with lots of mentions of other movies such as Star Trek, Wizard of Oz, Indiana Jones(\\"It looks like the temple of doom!\\") and loads more.<br /> My favourite bit is Dark Helmet(Get it, Darth Vader?). Rick Maronis plays him well and the whole movie is get so hilarious that I laugh out loud the from the minute it starts, right to the last few seconds.<br /> I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!
B000002KXO|4.0|&quot;Mirage&quot; contains several great tracks (including Lindsay's &quot;Book of Love&quot; and Christine's &quot;Hold Me&quot;), and should probably be viewed as a great album.  However, as might be expected when following masterpieces like &quot;Fleetwood Mac,&quot; &quot;Rumours,&quot; and &quot;Tusk,&quot; it is a bit of a letdown.  After those three classics, though, &quot;Mirage&quot; is still one of the group's best recordings.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is likely one of the most widely screened movies of the last twenty years. In many ways its effects on popular consciousness have been notable, and it also made a major star of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who up to that point had appeared only in supporting roles in minor films like \\"Stay Hungry\\" with Jeff Bridges and \\"The Villain\\" with an aging Kirk Douglas.  With the release of this film, all that was over in a heartbeat. Or perhaps one could say, in the speed of a laser beam. For this is a science fiction thriller to end all thrillers!<br />The movie staggers the viewer with the horrifying vision of a world at risk, of a world we can recognize in the act of propelling itself toward a nightmare future, a future that may well be dominated by impersonal and anti-human machines. Linda Hamilton plays the hapless, disorganized, and playfully immature Sarah Connor, future legendary mother to John Connor, the future potential leader of the Anti-machine rebellion that might just save the world in that future time.  And while poor Sarah is trying to wrap her mind around all this data being hurled at her by a solitary soldier sent back in time through a time machine by her son to warn her, a cybernetic warrior is systematically hunting and killing every other Sarah Connor in the Los Angeles county telephone book!<br />This sets the stage for non-stop, heart-wrenching action, and the viewer is assaulted by both sights and data that intrigue and astound him or her, for this is science fiction very well done, a story that has meat and bones over its substantial interior, and like the cyborg that Arnold plays, is ready to slay you into submission.  The scenes don't follow each other so much as get exploded from one sequence to the next, in a blood-curdling, shotgun wielding struggle to kill or be killed. And the struggle goes on and on. This is a classic thriller, folks, one that has already spawned another hit movie (T-2), and rumor now has it that Schwarzenegger and company have T-3 ready to begin production soon. In the unlikely event you have been off the planet and have missed seeing it to date, no problem. Just grab this, some popcorn, and a box of Jujifruits.  The show is about to begin!nd company have T-3 ready to begin production soon. In the unlikely event you have been off the planet and have missed seeing it to date, no problem. Just grab this, some popcorn, and a box of Jujifruits.  The show is about to begin!
0316779237|2.0|I enjoyed the first story about the author's adventures as a department store Christmas Elf. This was a true gem that made the book difficult to put down and I eagerly looked forward to the next 5 tales. Unfortunately, they all fell far short of the expectations laid out by their predecessor. The first story is great, but that fact alone can't hold the remainder of the book, therefore, I cannot recommend it.
6304779356|4.0|NOTICE I give the *DVD* 4 starts the movies gets FIVE!!!<br />   The movie is a good teen flick and will is a movie to watch to give you that feel good feeling,,,,, and the soundtrack to the movie or backround music is PERFECT! it beings out the movie a lot..<br /> BUt the DVD in my opion was dissaporint the only highlight<BR>  Theatical Trailers and Scene index<BR> The rest of it was all READING!! who would take the time read like 8 pages on a TV Screen of small parint!?!?!<BR> But atleast it is aviavible on both Widescreen and Standered... but it wouldent have hurted to add deleted screns or atleast a commintary.
B0000648WZ|5.0|I feel compelled to write because I think this movie is being viewed in an overly negative manner by people whose reviews miss an appropriate context in which to view the film.<br />I love this movie. It is a brilliant and thrilling piece of pop filmmaking. From the title, to the ultra-colored comic book look, to the tv and computer media influences, to the intensely fun teen-movie romance, and splattering gore, I have not seen a movie that excited me this much for a long time. I hold Robocop in high regard, but I am inclined to put this film a little above it.<br />If you enjoy a healthy dose of playful pop in your movies, I think this movie is perfect. If you want a literal translation of the book, certainly stay away. If you are looking for some version of gritty future realism, whatever that may be, stay away. If you can't locate the thoughtful depth in movies that don't come with a serious tone, stay away.<br />If you like excitement, satire, comedy, pulp, violence, and sex, all served in a colorful stew of spaceships and monsters, this is the movie for you!<br />PS. I didn't get the original DVD version, waiting for an enhanced edition. From what I have read, people who had the previous edition feel cheated by the new. I agree: a \\"director's cut\\" would be nice, but I can't complain about the new double disc set.
B000066I6N|4.0|I'll start right off by saying that hard-rock junkies or Led heads who only want to hear &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; need not apply.<br />After his rather uninspired collaboration with Jimmy Page (although the No Quarter album was respectable), Robert Plant gets his oft-overlooked solo career back on track with this fine album.  While Dreamland isn't as exciting or vibrant as his earlier solo work, it is the work of an artist who still has something to say, and the chops to say it.<br />This album picks up where Fate of Nations left off, in terms of style and atmosphere.  But whereas FoN was heavily slanted towards folk (in addition to rock), Dreamland pays homage to Plant's blues past.  The first song on the album, &quot;Funny In My Mind,&quot; slinks right out of the Louisiana swamps but has a distinct modern feel to it.  Excellent stuff.<br />I won't give a track-by-track review here.  But as others have mentioned, Plant's backing band is 100% on the money.  Although I still miss Robbie Blunt!  And Plant's voice has...well, it's not 1973 anymore.  But that's just fine with me.  Just like your favorite pair of sneakers with the worn out soles, off-white leather and frayed laces, Plant's voice has a distinguished, well-worn feel to it that brings these songs to life.  But to put your fears to rest, he still gets some energetic screams in there once in a while!<br />Bottom line - if you liked Fate of Nations you will like Dreamland.  If you appreciate what Robert Plant has done with his whole solo career (looking forward, not backward) then this album is a worthy addition to your collection.  But if all you want are songs that RAAWWWK!, pop in your copy of Houses of the Holy.  ; )
B000002KBH|5.0|Most casual Deadheads are probably satisfied with \\"Skeletons from the Closet.\\"  However, \\"American Beauty\\" is a far superior single-disc sampler of the Dead.  The album is filled with a rich, organic, country-rock sound - fuller and more statisfying than its stripped-down predecessor \\"Workingman's Dead.\\"  And it includes their two most beautiful classics, \\"Friend of the Devil\\" and \\"Ripple\\" - along with the underappreciated \\"Box of Rain.\\"  \\"American Beauty\\" is, quite simply, one of the best albums of the '70s.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil Collins is a difficult artist to get next to, at once quite friendly and yet also remote and distant. He has such an affable manner that it takes a while to recognize that he allows only limited proximity to himself and his own thoughts and feelings. Of course, he was enormously successful in the eighties and nineties both commercially and critically, and he was, for a while, at least, seemingly everywhere one looked.  What he offers here is a collection of hits from that period.  And quite a collection it is.<br />From the opening \\"Another Day In Paradise\\", a take on the economic and emotional contradictions modern society represents, to \\"True Colors\\", an offer to bare one's soul to a friend, this is an engaging song cycle.  Collins is nothing if not modern, and his take on issues as in \\"Easy Lover\\", Two Hearts\\", and \\"I Wish It Would Rain\\" are provide interesting commentary on the state of emotional relationships in contemporary society. Then we have more calculated commercial efforts such as \\"Against All Odds\\", written for the movie of the same name, and a wide range of numbers such as \\"Sussudio\\", \\"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\\", and \\"Both Sides Of The Story\\" which were huge commercial hits.<br />So too we have interesting numbers such as \\"Separate lives\\", \\"One More Night\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Something In The Air Tonight\\". He rounds out the gretest hits collection with \\"Dance Into The Light\\", a cover of the old hit \\"A Groovey Kind Of Love\\", and \\"Take Me Home\\".  All in all, this is a very well-constructed collection of Phil Collins hits, and a fairly concise recapitulation of his solo work. I always like listening to it, and I think you will, too. Enjoy!
B000066C6Z|4.0|For those who agree that this is one of the funniest movies of its genre, this DVD is a must-have for your collection. It's in Dolby Digital so you can enjoy the movie in 5.1 channel sound, plus the Alternate Scenes (which you might've already seen in the television presentations) are included, so you have it all.<br />That is where the quality ends though, everything else on the DVD is weak at best. The Audio Commentary is a total waste of time, they barely talk about the movie. It was disappointing to watch, especially when some of the funniest jokes are going on on screen. After 5 minutes you will agree and hit the &quot;Audio&quot; button on your DVD remote.
0790729970|5.0|Jim Carry's #1 favorit movie (well it should it becuase its the movie that caused his acting carrer to skyrocket!)I remeber seeing it whean it was in theaters and I remeber being probly the lousest one laughing in the theater (witch Iam useally not) yes it does push the fantesy world button a LITTLE bit but not annoyingly........... It defnitly falls under the Comady/Romatic catagory. But what happend to THE MASK II  There was 1 planned!
B00005YXZH|5.0|I bought this album a week ago and I haven't listened to anything else since. The beautiful and catchy songs have worked their way into my brain, and I love it. I think this is one of Wilco's best efforts to date. The lyrics are thoughtful, and the melodies are haunting. For some reason, it just makes me feel good. Thank you, Jeff Tweedy &amp; Co. for reaffirming that there's great new music out there to discover.
B000066C1N|5.0|Its good to finally hear Bryan Adam's voice again... and coupled with Hans Zimmer's music - you know that this has got to be a wonderful creation! The words are so inspiring and the music puts you in a happy &quot;spirit&quot;. The best track is &quot;Here I am&quot;. A must-have for Bryan Adam fans.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This movie was the overwhelmingly successful sequel to the original \\"Terminator\\" film that had established the series as well as the plausible context for this return to the science fiction genre and the notion of a world at risk at the hand of a murderous seemingly unstoppable cyborg. This time Schwarzenegger plays a cyborg sent back from the future and reprogrammed by Sarah Connor's son to save her and him (as a boy) from another, much more dangerous and technologically advanced cybernetic organism  (a T-1000 series) sent back to eliminate them all.  And so the incredible chase established in the first film resumes!<br />Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor, this time much more savvy, cunning, and street-smart. Newcomer Edward Furlong plays her son, and Robert Patrick plays Schwarzenegger's indefatigable adversary, the quicksilver T-1000 cyborg.  A number of others from the original movie are also in this sequel, and the movie propels all of them on through another series of sequences and situations at a speed that is both breathtaking and awe-inspiring. There is also a lot of humor here, as Furlong's character comes to trust and even love the Schwarzenegger cyborg as it protects and helps him to free his mother and evade the T-1000. Some of the language is a bit blue, for Arnold learns from Furlong how to free-associate among a string of four-letter invectives in establishing a running commentary regarding the actions of his foes.<br />This is a superior thriller, and stands well against the test of time. Some of the special effects are absolutely spellbinding, and the film will easily hold your rapt attention throughout its more than two hour length. Rumor has it that Schwarzenegger and company have agreed to begin production on a new sequel, T-3, sometime in the near-term future. You will love this movie, and I can highly recommend it. Enjoy!
B00005JCA9|5.0|As a huge Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts fan, you can see why this is my all time favorite movie.  Hugh Grant is funny without trying to be.  He has such a natural wit about him.  This movie has it all, humor, charm, and melt-your-heart moments that we all secretly hope for in our own lives.  Not to mention a terrific soundtrack featuring the song \\"She\\" by Elvis Costello.  <BR>A famous movie star Anna Scott(Julia Roberts)finds herself in a bookstore in Notting Hill London owned by William Thacher(Hugh Grant).  A few moments after she leaves he once again bumps into her and thus begins the story.  To him, she is a fantasy and to her, he is a normalcy she has never had. <BR>And the supporting cast........HILARIOUS!!!!  Only one word to say here....SPIKE!!!!  He alone keeps your side in stitches.  And what about little sister Honey???  Another outrageously  funny character.  <BR>This is a wonderful movie and if you haven't seen it you are truly missing out.

0972169504|5.0|Whew, how I love this comic strips very much !<br />I've already forget how I came to this homepage.  I was - procrastinating - at that time - just surfing the web while suddenly I saw this webpage <br />phd.stanford.edu<br />and boy, it makes me laugh aloud.  I registered instantly at that time, and I've also read all the previous issue.<br />For you who haven't read this comics, I'll tell ya abit.<br />The comics' story circles around a few individuals - graduate students - at Stanford University.  Hey, isn't that one of the famous school in America, and in the world.  Where Silicon Valley is just a stonethrow away.  Where Chelsea Clinton study too.  Where some matches of the 1994 World Cup Soccer was held.<br />Yes, but the story really touches the human side of graduate study.  Yes, sometimes he exaggerated too much - but what matters is that he knows the real thing.  Grad study is hard - classes and TA-ing in the early years - qualifying exams - research for the thesis.  <br />And you are underpaid.  You live in a dorm - a very small room. You work in cubicles. You meet your friends in high school reunion, and finding out that they have already made a success - while you still, yes, stuck in grad school.  You fail your horrible, tortorous qualifying exams.<BR>You are doing research - which you yourself are not sure about the outcomes of this research. Your family has a great expectation for you: a PhD would certainly be a cool thing, yet the real answer is not.<br />Although some of the facts and stories are highly exaggerated, yet I saw a clear reflection of my own experience, and thousands other people's experience - graduate students in all parts of the world.  I can laugh at myself now, and that bring a big relief to me.  <br />The characters: a character who in my opinion describes himself (the nerdy boy with a glasses, and later dark hair), Cecilia (who is absolutely smart but hasn't graduated yet - and meet her highschool's first crush in a reunion), Mike (a senior graduate students - only God and Jorge himself<BR>know how long he has been in grad school - even his professor doesn't know), Tajel (a graduate student in Philosophy), and Profesor Smith (the nerdy boy's advisor).<br />My favorite characters' are Cecilia and Mike. <br />Now here's my recommendation:<br />If you are ordinary people: BUY this book so you also can feel what is a graduate student's life like.<br />If you are an undergrad who doesn't want to go to grad school: BUY this book so you might want to CHANGE your mind.<br />If you are an undergrad who want to go to grad school: BUY this book so you would THINK again about your decision.<br />If you are graduate students, professors, post docs: BUY this book so you can see a reflection of all your experience in a more comforting, and leisuring way.   I also hope you would get some spirit to get back on track for those who are already frustated.<br />And if you buy this book, whoever you are: TELL Your friends to buy it too, or at least tell them about the websites !<br />Finally, kudos for Jorge Cham. He's a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford himself, but his talent in cartooning is great. <br />I strongly hope he would keep his comic strips alive after he graduated.<BR>But now, he might called himself `Professor' this time.<br />Kudos for you, Jorge.  May the geeks be with you, and you be free from The Thesis !
B000002P2W|4.0|This is NOT the best album by The Who. That honor clearly belongs to Who's Next, possibly the greatest rock album of all time. By Numbers contains some classic songs, though. My favorites are Squeeze Box, They're all in Love, The Blue Red and Grey. Others mention Slip Kid and However Much I Booze. Fine. This is an uneven album, produced in the wake of the band's most successful period, while they stuggled to deal with success and their own mortality. Still, the songs here are not tied together by an incohesive movie theme...a good thing. The remastered version of this album has terrific sound. Pick it up if you have any interest in The Who.
B000002MG1|5.0|When they recorded Murmur back in the early 80's, REM was one of the most influential yet overlooked bands.  All that changed with Automatic for the People.  This album was for everyone.  There is not one bad song on it, they all shine and pave the way for the next track.  From the classic \\"Man on the Moon\\" about Andy Kauffman, to reminiscing on early life in \\"Nightswimming\\" and creating a simple song that John Denver wish he had recorded with \\"Find the River,\\" REM knows what it takes to make a flawless album.
B000066AXE|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater, I had the pleasure of not knowing who John Nash was.  I spent half of the movie wondering....is he or isn't he?  Russell Crowe, like him or not, did a great job portraying Prof. Nash.  But what had me even more spellbound was Jennifer Connelly.  She made this movie what it was.  She held her own with Mr. Crowe himself. Her portrayal as John Nash's ever faithful, supporting and loving wife, Alicia Nash, very much deserved that Oscar she took home.    <BR>At the beginning you see Nash in his early years, when his schizophrenia was in its early stages.  As the movie progresses you see his illness develop into something that consumes his life and inhabits his ability to function in everyday life.<BR>After being diagnosed, he believes he can find a way to cope with this without taking medication.  <BR>A Beautiful Mind is a great movie and a must have any DVD collection.  While I am not certain it was deserving of Best Picture, I Am Sam was in my unexpert, amateur opinion, it is definatley an upstanding film.

0060005424|5.0|Lirael, the sequal to Sabriel, is the best book I've ever read.  Most likely because I totally connected with the main character, Lirael (I love to read books about people who also love to read books).  As a \\"late-bloomer\\" I loved being able to read about a heroine whose emotions and fears are real and I felt like I could empathize with the girl.  Nix introduces us to two new breeds of Charter, the Wallmakers and Remembrancers (Or more correctly Remembrancer).  Join Lirael and Sameth (a prince) on this journey of self-discovery and finding friends to a place beyond your wildest dreams.  Nix leaves readers begging for more.<br />...
B000002LCI|5.0|This is another one of DM's classic works.  This album stands out as being one of Depeche Mode's best albums along with their Some Great Reward and Black Celebration.   I would say that this is Depeche Mode's best album after Some Great Reward.  This is one of my all time favorite DM albums.  This album really has some classic DM material.  This album contains one of Depeche Modes best and classic tracks Strangelove.  How can any DM fan say that Strangelove is not one of Depeche Mode's best.  Music for the Masses is an entire musical work of art.  It is just one great song after another with classic DM electronic gloom instrumentation.  Never let me down again starts off this radiant album followed by Martin sung Things You Said.  Then comes Strangelove an all time DM classic hit.  Don't forget that Behind the Wheel is also on this album.  It is another unforgettable DM track.  This album also contains several instrumental tracks in which Depeche Mode utilizes their eccentric skill.  Instrumental tracks that stand out is the most popular and beautiful Pimph and Agent Orange.<BR>Anyone that is a true Depeche Mode fan has this album in their collection.  It is one of the best ever!
0316666343|5.0|I too bought this book on a whim.  I usually have a hard time getting into books and often lose interest quickly.  From the second I started to read this book, I knew this one was different.   I had a difficult time putting the book down, wanting to know what was going to happen next.  The idea behind the book is so unique!  I was only half way through the book and I was telling family and friends how wonderful it was.  It really makes you think that anything is possible and that we never truly lose those who pass on before us.
B00005JKJA|1.0|All through the movie I was busy trying to understand it. By the end I had put the movie back to a prior part like three times or more, and afterwards it took me more then an hour to (try to) puzzle the pieces together. Especially the parts with the &quot;demon&quot; were completely confusing.<br />My question is, what is the point? Clever as it may be, I did not enjoy this movie and I would not recommend it to anyone.
6302787068|4.0|I know even people who are 30 years old and have this movie on tape and still watch it!!! it it something enjoyable by everyone...  I remeber seeing it in theaters a very long time ago like 5 years ago,, and I liked it even thean.<br /> Jafar is probly my all time favorit Disney villian<BR>  but despite orther reviews on here it isnt recisast and it inst bizzare eather, the only little bizzare thing about it that is takes a place in Saudi Arbria and it looks like a peaveful place,,, witch HEY its a kids movie it wont have anything bout war or terrorism!
B000002HJR|5.0|It's quite unfortunate that I didn't think to write a review earlier (Years). Alot of people still don't know about the Down (Side project) but hopefully with the realese of the Down II album, people will recognise NOLA aswell. I didn't really enjoy the Down II album, so I haven't bought it. But this album appeared on my family's cd rack (I'm guessing 1995-96) and everyone still loves it. I still listen it on a regular basis and still find it stimulating.<BR>Comparing this album to Down II is like comparing (Ozzy Osbourne - Ozzmosis) to one of his newer albums, they just don't seem to have that perfection and quality (not in a audio sense, but with use of lyrics, instruments composition).<BR>This album is truely great and I say that from a non metal head perspective, (I have burt Bacharach on the cd tower aswell). LOL. But seriously.<br />My fav. tracks - ALL OF THEM, but more than most<BR>Eyes of the South, Stone the Crow, Pray for the Locust, Swan Song, Bury Me In Smoke...<br />BUY, LISTEN, ENJOY
B0000666DW|5.0|First off, let me start this by saying Brann Dailor is one hell of a drummer. The way he plays is just sick. I'm assuming Keith Moon was one of his influences. Aside from the astonishing drum performance, the album has incredible production, great packaging, and plenty of gigantic riffs. The heavy grooves and precise twists and turns are stitched together with beautifully depressing passages that offer not only a refreshing break from the chaotic aural beating, but also leave you anticipating the next outpouring of emotions through not only the screamed vocals, but also the unfortunate tortured instruments. If you like bands like Unsane, Eyehategod, Today Is The Day, Neurosis, or maybe even Kyuss then I would recommend giving this a try.
B00006690G|5.0|Truly a taste  from dre and Em they are truly connecting to produce one of THE greatest rapp albums i have ever heard ! all the songs show his true lyrical genius ! his genius style much like 2pacs but with a spit ability like no other ! white men can't jump but they sure can rap eh ? <br />truly a must buy if you appreciate the art of rapp and if you just like mean beats <br />few of my favs <br />till i collapse<BR>soldier <BR>my dads gone crazy
B00003CXTG|3.0|YES in a little way it did copy Titanic it is a love story<BR>   It involes an actual real life tragity and just like titanic somewhat copyed Gone with the wind..<BR> Well anyway<BR>  this movie somewhat makes Titanic seem short <BR>   I watched this movie wiht a grandfarther and he is a korea and vietname war vertern and YES I Know he wasent in Pearl HArbor  but he has a good idea of war,, and just like a lot of war veterns ive talked to about this movie he agreed <BR> \\"Its to much Hollywood not enough actual war involed\\" since it claims to be a romance/war movie you can keep the romance part but take out the War Gore Area............<BR> Yes its a classic so Buy it<BR>  The DVD its self is pretty good it is just annoying to siwtch disc's thows.. The Speical fueatures are GREAT!
B00005MKA1|3.0|I have to say I don't really love this album. It's good, but surely not as good as others. All of the songs are love songs, so that in the long run the words sound a bit boring to me. All the strenght and power of Marley's political or social songs lacks in Kaya.<BR>In the end, quite a good album, but if you want to know Bob Marley and don't have so much money to spend, buy Legend, Survival or Exodus.
B0000640VO|5.0|Breathtaking cinematography, amazing acting and a fabulous story. Utterly enchanting. After each time I watch this movie I am determined to see things I don't normally see in my every day life. It is truly inspirational and comical.<br />Even those who don't like foreign films should check this out. You are truly missing out on the best movie made in YEARS if you don't.
B00001ODHJ|5.0|could this movie be any better? hail to the king, baby.
0971855110|5.0|I have listened to all the buzz over FlyLady's system of cleaning. I was particularly susceptible to her advice because, if nothing else, I want my sink clean, ... and that goes for drying it out afterwards with a towel. But of course, cleaning the sink is just the baby step to getting a grip on the chaos at home.<br />Some of the baby steps on the way to Chaos-Control include setting up various routines. This is effective if you do them for two weeks at the least because that is how long it takes to establish a new habit. Some of the routines include a bedtime routine that may be a bit over-ambitious for some of us, but who says you need to do the entire list:<br />  1 Pick up and put away stuff in living room<br />  2.Clean up kitchen, including polishing that sacred sink<br />  3.Pick up any hot spots (the places clutter likes to roost)<br />  4.Make a list of tomorrow's tasks.<br />  5.Check calendar for appointments<br />  6.Do anything tonight that you can, like lunches<br />  7.Put things you need to take with you by the door. ...more<br />this list goes on and that's just bed time. But you get the picture.<br />I would recommend this book especially for anyone who is partially or wholly disabled (as I write this, I have a cast on my broken leg, so I know what I'm talking about here.) Getting around if you are disabled is a real chore; clutter in the way means at the very least difficulty in getting by, and can lead to a more serious accident. Also, you need a system to keep things to hand--you can't just jump up and run over to them.  I don't think you have to copy FlyLady's entire method, but surely using some of it and building up to your own system is better than hunting for clean underwear in the tool box.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie was one of the best films I have seen this year. I absolutely loved it! Certain films have the ability to give you a fresh perspective - they can change the way you look at things - and Amelie is one of those films. And rarer still, Amelie combines this ability with some really hilarious moments and some equally touching scenes!<br />More specifically, my favorite thing about Amelie is its originality and creativity. It had a unique style that really allowed the viewer to get into the heads and hearts of the characters. This is probably due in part to the sarcastic, funny, and clever script and the remarkably effective voice over narration (which really sets the tone for the movie). Also, Amelie's originality and freshness is due to the interesting directing style.<br />Essentially, Amelie is about a young French waitress (Audrey Tautou) who decides to help people fix up their lives. In her haste to help others, however,... This plot summary really doesn't convey the charming quality of the movie...but believe me it was wonderful!<br />The acting was also great, and Audrey Tautou really reminded me of the other Audrey, the great Audrey Hepburn. They share the same shy glances, pretty faces, and delicate charm. In fact, in one scene in particular (when Amelie goes to meet Nino at the merry-go-round), I was sure that the director was poking fun at a classic Audrey Hepburn movie, Charade (where Audrey and Cary Grant meet in front of a merry-go-round), by dressing Amelie up in Audrey Hepburn style clothing. Did anyone else notice this?<br />Anyhow, I don't know how else to recommend this movie. It made my day! In one word: WONDERFUL!
B000005DQR|5.0|Had this since it was first released in '96 and have kept it spinning since. Absolutely the best record I've ever heard, complete from start to finish. Still gives me chills. Incredible production with just raw beats. Simply a must own. I get excited for first timers to listen to this, it's that special. His current album \\"The Private Press\\" is also a great record, with some cuts that could have been on Endtroducing... but it doesn't quite have the soul that this one does. Do yourself a favor and expose yourself to this incredible piece of art.
0684847817|3.0|When I first saw Brian Froud's artwork in the original (and far superior) Faeries book, I became heartsick for the fantasy world that he and Alan Lee had created. The froud illustrations were especially great-  he seemed to have a delicate knack for line and a really subtle, balanced use of color.  As an artist myself, he seemed to create the kind of drawings and paintings I always felt I should be doing-i don't know exactly how to convey this-it was fresh and new to me, yet strangely familiar.   The extremely detailed, Richard Dadd like tapestry paintings were the most impressive, such as the &quot;goblin market one&quot;, &quot;knockers&quot; or &quot;faerie ways&quot;.  the way he airbrushed a fairy's wing, the pinkness in a blue fairy's knees, the dark blue knuckles and fingertips of a goblin, all this was exactly what I had always felt, artistically!  Here was an artist who was truly inspired and sensitive. So imagine my sad disappointment when, after waiting for three years, I saw &quot;good faeries/bad faeries&quot;.  To be sure, there are more than a handful of nice paintings in this one, although I think something of the subtlety in the originals had been lost in reproduction. But that does not excuse the rest.  Half the illustrations look like things the artist had dashed off at the breakfast table while eating.  A quick pencil sketch often fills up an entire page, and it is not even of the quality that you'd find in the first book.  All the tightness of those sketches has deteriorated. I can appreciate looseness, but not sloppiness. One would think that Froud would have a better handle on the &quot;bad faeries&quot; section, but there are only a few impressive ones there.  Over all, the book seemed like a couple really nice paintings but with many lackluster quickies dumped in as filler.  <BR>Please don't misunderstand me, these are only my opinions.  There are a few glories in here, like &quot;Gloominous Doom&quot;, &quot;Laume&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Bad Faeries&quot;. There really are a few exquisite ones.  But not enough.  Maybe it's just because of my familiarity of old school froud, from &quot;Land of Froud&quot;, &quot;master snickup's cloak&quot; and the first &quot;Faeries&quot;, that I was so let down to find a book where half of it was aced out just to complete a volume.
B00004NRWH|4.0|Along reading these reviews, some are just simply Not a reviw,<BR>but rather people saying how much they hate this particular<BR>group or this kind of music, whicth not only do I find them to<BR>be somewhat offencive, but just typing this band bad 1,000<BR>thousand times in a row, just with a different scentence structure.Now does it matter is a band is somewhat radio freindly<BR>or somewhat unoriganal? No. All in all who really cares.Does<BR>this band threaten your existence so much that some people feel<BR>the need to ram this band in the ground,no. Now with that said,<BR>I'll just get to this album. No, it's nothing to inovative, or<BR>origanal, but who care, right? Look at it for what it is, just<BR>a really good altrenative rock band who can play the hell out<BR>of there instruments who don't feel the need to stress the same<BR>curse words over and over again.Like the songs breath,cowboy hat,<BR>not leaving yet(just proves that these guys got talent, epeacily<BR>with the solo),and hold out your hand.Now I have had this CD for<BR>about 2 years now, and I still play it regularly.So if you want<BR>a solid, rockin album with plenty of rockin tunes, go ahead and<BR>buy this album, and also get silver side up.
B00000JQFM|3.0|This was my first Satch Cd and at first I didn't like it.  I guess it was because he wasn't as flashy as Vai (who is still my favorite).  I also think he needs to give his wah and flange pedal a rest.  Now after learning to play a few songs and buying the G3 album I like it better.  Much better
B00005JKEC|2.0|I rarely if ever go to see violent films, but being a Denzel Washington fan, I just had to check this one out.  He gave a good performance, as he always does.  Unfortunately, I can't say that this particular film was too good.  Hmn...that's probably why Tranining Day wasn't nominated for anything other than actor.  There are much better Denzel films at your local video store, o.k?    Oh, and as for the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, they have once again lost credibility by giving the lead actor award to a talented actor (Denzel) but for the wrong film.  It's ironic how Denzel himself was quoted as saying (weeks prior to the show) that he did not want the Academy to do him any favors and that the winners should win on their own merit.  I couldn't agree more.  It's an even greater shame that Will Smith, who had convinced himself that he (Will Smith) had no chance of winning for Ali, decided to go on one entertainment show after another, labeling the Academy as racist.  What a pathetic thing to do Mr. Smith.  Most first time nominees are flattered and honored, but not this guy.  Oh, and did I mention that these \\"racist themed interviews\\" with Mr. Smith were done AFTER Halle Berry won the SAG???  I truly believe that racial politics put a sour note on this years awards show.  Oh, and probably the fact that the Academy did not want Russell to win (jealousy of his success, the Bafta incident, not an American...who knows why...)  You're a great actor Denzel, but Russell's role in Beautiful Mind was much more of an Oscar caliber role.  Shame on the Academy voters for acting like high school kids (i.e. voting for the popular guy as if they were voting for class president), rather than acting like professionals and voting for the best performance.
0440214041|3.0|While the book entertained me, it is certainily not a book for Republicans.  Grisham is definately a democrat and some of his stereotypes can be offensive.  Besides that, it is certainly an entertaining and often gripping read.
B000006Z1X|1.0|This is a really bad album. The band's first record, No Parole from Rock'N'Roll is a great album with good songs and intelligent lyrics. This one is ordinary 80's metal with too much focus on the technical parts instead of the songs and the lyrics.<br />OK, No Parole from Rock'N'Roll has many technically advanced solos from Yngwie Malmsteen, but at least he's playing emotionally (or was at the time before he became a pale image of Vai) but this is guitars completely without emotion. That's how I've always concieved of Steve Vai, and that is how I feel when listening to this album. Also, singer Graham Bonnet doesn't sound like Bonnet. It may be a good thing to try to improve your vocal registry, but I think he fails on this record.<br />Alcatrazz are well worth to remember for No Parole which is a very good mixture of classical Heavy Metal in the Deep Purple/Rainbow genre and the Power Metal that would come. This record, however deserves no more than being forgotten as just one of the boring tedious technicalist metal albums without soul that were produced in the 80's. I can't see why anyone would like to listen to this album unless they are a Vai fan, or if they like music more for the difficult things people do with their instruments than for the music itself.
B000001ELL|3.0|This was recorded at the height of disco mania and I guess kiss figured \\"hey we can do this\\" and gave it a shot.  Bad idea.  A good opening song, \\"I was made for loving you\\" that got pretty high on the charts.  Peter didn't play drums on this album....(get ready for a long story folks) since this was the first album after the solo albums and Peter was ready to quit, the guys said \\"to show you how much we want you in the band, we will use your producer that you used for the solo album\\".  It turned out that the producer (Vinie Poncetia) didn't think Peter was good enough to play on a kiss album and peter got so mad he smashed a mirrow with his hand and dagamged his hand badly.  You hear Anton Fig on drums but Peter sings some.  There is more than one good song on here but its to \\"disco-pop\\" to be a good album.  Don't get it unless you have to have everything kiss (like me).
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is excellent and you should absolutely check it out. Anthony made my summer a whole lot hotter.
0425170349|5.0|Rainbow Six is just another thriller from the greatest author in the world.  In Rainbow Six, Clancy goes for a different look.  It may be one that some didn't like, but I thorughly enjoyed it.  The novel contains his usual vivid action scenes and detailed descriptions, but never before have John Clark and Ding Chavez been the main characters of a Clancy novel, and that in itself gives a different flavor. He also has never gone after a plot this big. This is literally saving the world stuff here. Environmental extremists hatching a plan to wipe out humanity is not something I'd expect from him. A controversial novel to be sure, but a must read for all Tom Clancy fans.
B000003S5H|4.0|This is my introduction to Air and I bought it soley on the reviews on Amazon and the style of music.  I have to agree with the positive reviewers, this is great stuff.  It is so unnobtrusive you could play it any time, but it's so cool and interesting you can, well... play it anytime.  There is heavy use of vocoders but it fits the music so doesn't bother me.  Beth Hirsch's vocals are just beautiful on 2 songs.<br />Like a previous reviewer said, all the songs are good, you don't have to skip any.  I am going to see what else I can find of theirs and snatch it up, highly reccomended.
B000001ELF|5.0|This was really good.  Ace's first atempt at vocals and he did exelent.  Awesome guitar solos and since Anton Fig was the drummer and he is so great, there is even a drum solo.  A great song you might have heard is \\"Back in the new york groove\\".  If you are a Yankees baseball fan you have heard this during the 7th inning stretch.  Buy it, Listen to it, Cherish it, Buy another to keep in an air tight container and preserve forever.
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is so excellent and soulful I can't stop listening to it. This is a must have. Anthony sure made my summer a lot hotter!
B000002B7M|4.0|Ozzy was a man with nothing to lose at the time of this album, and he produced a number of classics with the help of the incredible late guitarist Randy Rhoads.  This is definitely Ozzy's most solid solo album, if not a classic.  &quot;Crazy Train&quot; speaks for itself and Randy's solo is so imaginative, as if they aren't on most tracks on the album.  &quot;I Don't Know&quot; is my personal favorite because it's a great rocker..I highly recommend checking this one out
B000001ELD|2.0|You would expect the demon of kiss to have a heavy enerjetic solo album but its the exact opposite.  I think there are 2 good songs on it.  I believe we actually have Cher to blame for this because she was dating Gene at the time and probably influenced him.  There is a good version of &quot;See you in your dreams tonight&quot; which was on the kiss album Rock and roll over.  Do your self a favor and don't buy this unless you are a kiss obsessor (like myself).
6305358613|5.0|Because of this particular film, I have been extremely interested in the Renaissance era of Europe. This movie was very finely acted and the footage was gorgeous. Cate Blanchett was superb. Sticks to general facts quite well.
B000002H3E|3.0|I have to admit, this has a few great songs on it but not one that lives in my player.  I like the album cover just cause i get to see one of mu favorite guitarist (george lynch) with but poofy hair and lookin all feminin.  Kinda funny.
B000021Y7W|5.0|This concert starts off with a lone David Byrne with acoustic guitar and tape player doing an incredible version of \\"Psycho killer.\\"  Near the end of the song the tape player spins out of control and David trips and loses control of his balance and then regains his footing when the tape comes back to it's regular cadence.  This first song is indicative of his performance throughout the entire concert - brilliant and creative.  Everyone else involved in the performcance is also very energetic.  I have never seen a performance where so many band members are dancing for such a long time as I have here.  This is the most energetic performance I've ever seen.  At one point David runs around the stage four times and then comes back to the mic and continues running in place.  David makes the oddest moves with his body throughout.  There is no doubt that David and the talking heads were on the top of their game that night in December of 1983.  I love the two female dancers/singers that offset David's quirkiness with their cool dancing.  The one thing about this video that I noticed first is that it gets better and better with each new song or with each new band member until the climax with \\"Burning down the house.\\"  This is the best concert I've seen on video or on real life.  I never get tired of watching it either.  If you haven't decided on buying it yet then consider this: before my brother saw this video he did not care for the talking heads but when we got half way through watching this video he said to me -\\"I wonder if I can find any of their live stuff on the internet.  They're a really great band.\\"  This video is just awesome.  See for yourself what everyone has been talking about.  Favorite performances: \\"Thankyou for sending me an angel\\", \\"Cities,\\" \\"Life during wartime,\\" \\"What a day that was,\\" and \\"Naive Melody.\\"
B000001EKX|3.0|Where this album came from is anyones guess.  Poor quality recording and not many good songs at all.  So many great songs on the debut album but #2 just made the critics all the more sure that they were right about kiss being a failier.  Its not terrible, you might like it, i mean, i liked a few songs but it dosen't have the overall greatness that most kiss albums have.
B000067CPX|2.0|The only good song is By the Way this albums is way to soft for me i liked californication cause it seemed like they were having fun and rocking out but this time it seems like they are like all mellow and not really rock at all i dont really like it. sorry guys its not worth buying because if you're like me u like the rock red hot chili peppers and not the soft mellow red hot chili peppers.
B000067CQK|5.0|OK, we've all heard this before -- so why buy this disc? One reason: It sounds better (if only marginally). I have a very good discman, and there IS a difference. The Ryko mix is good, but this one sparkles. Every layer is crisp and details emerge that are muddy on other discs. <br />The booklet is nothing special; actually, it's disappointing. It doesn't even include basic materials such as the lyrics, which were on the Ryko edition. Here, they refer you to davidbowie.com for the lyrics, which is a pay site Bowie is promoting as a sort of lifestyle choice. Furthermore, I suspect all the good stuff was saved for the glossy, overpriced...book they want you to buy. Oh well, I guess Ziggy is a capitalist.<br />This is definitely for fans. But practically everyone is a fan, so maybe this one is for audiophiles. If you don't have equipment good enough to tell the difference, you don't need it. 5 stars for the music, 3 stars for the booklet.<br />PS: My vote for the next couple of sets is: \\"Heroes\\" and \\"Scary Monsters.\\"
B000067CPX|5.0|I had the \\"misfortune\\" of meeting Mr. Kiedis one beautiful Spring day in Kansas City.  The evening prior I had seen the Peppers in concert with the Foo Fighters.  I ran into Mr. Kiedis the next day and the sunlight and my first win as an attorney in juvenile court was making me feel on top of the world-- as if I could go up to this famous person and tell him, \\"Hey, I really enjoyed your concert.\\"  And that's what I did.  And I really did enjoy the Peppers in concert--even though I actually went to see the Foo Fighters.  And I just wanted him to know that I thought he did a great job and I was really impressed. Ooops! I think he's heard that before and he was not amused and seemed quite annoyed at my approach and compliment.  I felt like a stalker.  Ever since that encounter, I've had an extreme aversion to any music by the Chili Peppers because I just associate it with my \\"stalking\\" behavior and I just get really embarrassed.  I tried to avoid for the longest time the song \\"By the way,\\" and once turned to NPR to avoid it.  Low and behold, I found myself listening to a glowing review of \\"By The Way\\" on NPR and they played snippets of these beautiful songs that made my heart swoon.  And the lyrics were so poetic and well-matched to the music that carried the words--very much like Nirvana's ability to so artistically mix music, lyrics and tone of voice into something completely adhesive and meticulous. (not that \\"By The Way\\" sounds anything like Nirvana--but I find it so rare when the music, words, and vocals all work so well together at the same time).  Anyway, I bought \\"By The Way\\" and I love it, even if I am reminded of my \\"stalking\\" behavior.  But if I ever see Mr. Kiedis again, I won't dare tell him I love this album-- although I do love it so much, I'll just have to bite my tongue!
0788812408|5.0|Sigh. Ok, I'll admit I'm a guy (with no kids). So what am I doing reviewing the Little Mermaid, you say? Maybe I'm was a sucker for a pretty face - real or animated, but I really loved this film a great deal. I never would have imagined I would fall for something like this. After all, I was 18 when the film first came out, certainly not a child, and I was never a Disney animation fan (I prefer Japanese anime). So how did someone like me, mature and sophisticated beyond my years became enthralled by...THIS? After all, wasn't it just a kiddie cartoon?! I don't know...I guess there was something truly MAGICAL about this film - a certain sparkle and dazzle that Disney was never truly able capture before or after. Despite the film being a bit formulaic, it somehow flows beautifully and surprisingly well. The classic fairy tale was transformed into a more modern and hip coming-of-age story with a happy ending (of course)! The songs were among the most wonderful I have ever heard, worthy of Broadway (it WAS composed by a pair of Broadway vets after all)! The musical numbers were spectacular, varying from the deliciously witty and delightful to the poignant and emotional. The animation was a kaleidoscope of rich colors and incredibly fluid, graceful motion. The story was fast paced and hilarious! And of course, who can ever forget our wonderful heroine, Ariel - the embodiment of beauty, innocence, and childlike curiousity, who yearns for a world beyond her own. You can really feel for her as if she was flesh and blood. A wonderful film - one that I hate to admit I love. I guess I'm what you would call a closet Mermaid fan....
0452282152|5.0|Middle and High School History and Art teachers looking for a great read-aloud need look no further. GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING has appeal. Although we cannot time travel, reading a book like this makes it possible to both travel back in time and be entertained. You learn about the most intimate details of 17th century life; the place of women in society, the struggle of the lower classes, tile-making and art of the century, Vermeer's art in particular, the creation of paints and color mixing, courting, prominence of religion, painters and patrons, and sexual awakenings. Even everyday washing and ironing was made interesting by Tracy Chevalier's artistic writing.
0790743221|5.0|I first watched this movie expecting a riotous screwball comedy. I was disappointed. This may not be one of the funniest comedies ever made, but it is certainly one of the best. Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Jimmy Stewart all turn out first-rate performances. Cary Grant especially caught my eye, however. His part is surprisingly small in the movie as far as the number of lines he has or the amount of screen time. But he conveys so much emotion with just a few words or even a glance. This is, in my opinion, his best role. He seems to just be there to provide a few quips here and there, but if you look closer you can see his disgust for the society he lives in and the pain he feels to see his only true love to be married to someone else. Hepburn and Grant are the two who propel the film forward. Grant is madly in love with his ex-wife in spite of her flaws while Hepburn feels that she can only love a perfect man. They are so completely opposite that they belong together, which is why the ending is so suspenseful (I won't give anything away.) These are real people--real people who are clever and funny, perhaps, but real just the same--which is why we don't remember the laughs so much as the tears. I think most everyone can identify with Grant because everyone has loved someone who doesn't love them. Everyone has had to give their own happiness up for the one they love, even if they get nothing in return. And everyone wants a happy ending.
B000067CPX|3.0|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was awesome, and even though they lightened up in Californication, it was still an awesome album too. When \\"By The Way\\" came out, I was excited, cause it was a good song and was ready for a new album! However, I almost threw the CD out my car window the first time listening to it. At first listen I was very disappointed, but listening to it a couple times more, it's a so-so album. There is really nothing special to it. Mother's Milk and Uplift Mofo Party were better albums than this one... It lacks the charisma and chemistry that the other albums had. You can tell that pretty much John Frusciante wrote almost all the songs. It's kind of a depressing album. They should really look into changing their name, cause \\"Red Hot\\" is not them. I still love these guys, but hey, I guess they were bound to put out a bad one.
B00003CY0V|3.0|I'll admit I often enjoy movies for shallow reasons.  For instance, I'm a fan of Australian actor Hugh Jackman, who, in addition to his demonstrated thespian skills, is quite attractive.  I never tire of looking at him, and I've made a point of seeing all his American films, no matter how good (\\"X-Men\\") or bad (\\"Someone Like You\\").  Which explains why I went out of my way to see \\"Swordfish,\\" which was actually better than I expected.  A fast-moving plot powered by John Travolta's over-the-top performance, along with Jackman, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle and blink-you'll-miss-'em roles for Drea de Matteo of \\"The Sopranos\\" and esteemed playwright/actor Sam Shepard.  Berry's ballyhooed nudity was gratuitous, but she projected actual acting chops in this film, along with Jackman, who didn't waste the dollars spent on his dramatic training.  Three flying buses for this thoroughly enjoyable flick.
B00005OAIE|1.0|I will say that John Mayer is an accomplished guitar player. I think he has the potential to be a good song writer. However, he just didn't show it on this album. I listened to every song on the album and was, well, bored. Nothing stood out, nothing really made me think, &quot;Wow, that was a good song.&quot; Nothing stuck in my head and I had no desire to listen to the disk again. You know how occasionally you listen to an album and it influences your life or it makes you think? This never came close for me. Sorry John.
0385720920|4.0|Victor, a sex addict who is a member of a 12-step group in order to meet new sex partners makes a living off of contributions from Good Samaritans who have rescued him during scam choking-to-death episodes in order to support his crazy institutionalized Mother who may have artificially conceived him using cells from the stolen foreskin of Jesus, is trying to figure out if he's a nice guy or not. Man, that was a fun synopsis to write! It is also a fun book to watch unfold. The blurb on the back says Chuck P has a \\"Swiftian gift for satire\\". I don't know what the heck that means but you'll find a weird, hilarious and twisted story. It's as shocking and off the wall as William S. Burroughs, but as compelling and entertaining as stalking your next date. He doesn't sound like anyone else out there.<br />When I read this book, and Fight Club before it, I was convinced that no one could write this deeply and viscerally about these bizarre events without having lived through them. Palahniuk knows too much to simply be using his imagination. I'm not just talking about being a member of Sex Addicts Anonymous or how to have \\"oops\\" sex in airplane bathrooms. How about knowing the type people who work in a re-creation of a Colonial village? It's a stupid job that requires plenty of recreational (sex and drug) diversions, along with the few employees who really take it seriously. <br />The book ends a little unsatisfactorily. What was it all about? What was I supposed to \\"get\\"? You have to risk your life to get love. You have to get right to the edge of death to be saved. Oh well, great, amazingly original writing, insight into people you'd definitely want to avoid in the suburbs and a quick peek inside a couple of twisted losers. <BR>See also: Ordinary folk. <BR>See also: You and me.
0312265859|4.0|Eight is a knock out. Stephanie Plum will bring you to all walks of life as a bounty hunter. She brings excitement to the story and will keep you guessing. This is my first book of Janet Evanovich and she brought excitement to the book. Check it out. And who's that Rabbit?
B00005T7I6|5.0|Dick Tracy was one of the most raved about films of 1990, and it certainly was grand. It won three oscars, though I believe it deserved more.<BR>     The story is about a detective in a late 30s city named Dick Tracy. He is having trouble dealing with the gang owned by Lips Manlis, who also has control over The Club Ritz. However, Lips and his sultry singer, Breathless Mahoney, get kidnapped by Big Boy Caprice, who takes over the business, uniting the gang leaders. It's up to Tracy to defeat Big Boy and keep his relationship with Tess Trueheart in tact (as Breathless has taken an interest in him).<BR>     The plot may not seem like much, but it's effective and actually has some subtle parodies of gangster films.<BR>    Characters are quite varied. Warren Beatty directed and starred as Dick Tracy. He's not quite as bad as a lot of people think, but he's still kind of stiff. His character should have many levels, but he ends up just fair.<BR>   Glenne Headley (sp?) does a thoroughly convincing job as Tess Trueheart, Tracy's love interest. She is completely competent. The Kid, Charlie Korsmo, is one of those kid actors who's fine but not great. He's not on Haley Joel Osment's level, but he's not as bad as Jake Lloyd. His character is pretty lame.<BR>    Breathless Mahoney is played by none other then Madonna, and she certainly does sing pretty well. However, her acting isn't as good and she is in some of the most unfortunate scenes in the film.<BR>    The villains look and act great. Al Pacino is spectacular as Big Boy Caprice, the main villain. He's comical and evil at the same time: a spectacular parody of his Michael Coreleone. Dustin Hoffman is fine as Mumbles. Mandy Patnikin is good as 88 Keys, the piano player. R.G. Armstrong and Ed O'Ross also turn in strong performances as Pruneface and Itchy, two thugs. However, my favorite character in the film is played by William Forsythe. Flattop is the perfect sadistic gunman, and I like him alot. Finally, a new villain named The Blank is a mystery for most of the film.<BR>    The makeup makes the villains look all the more convincing. It's very faithful to the comic that way, which is nice. The sets and props are all bright and colorful, again keeping in tune with the comic. Music was pretty good. Madonna's songs were all fine. I really liked the song \\"Back in Business.\\"<BR>     All and all, Dick Tracy is one of my favorite films: a vibrant comic book movie that does all the right things. Highly recomennded!
0140149295|5.0|I can't say enough things about this TRUE story!  Everyone should read this great book with some great life lessons in it.
B000005Z0E|4.0|This is not the cd you should buy if your just getting into pac. The lyrics are some of his best but the beats wont hold you to the song and often make you skip it. SOngs like Brenda's Got A Baby and Trapped stand out because the production is high quality but most songs arent. Still buy it but make it one of your last Pac purchases so you understand where he is coming from instead of jumping right in the middle Get either All Eyes On Me or Until The ENd Of Time or ME against the world first.
B000002MIB|4.0|One Question is posed by the editorial on this 2-disc set: YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?! What's this &quot;David Lee Who?&quot; garbage?! I saw Van Halen twice with Sammy Hagar, and gained alot of respect for him (He performed in New Orleans with strep throat, against doctor's orders!), but David Lee Roth was the voice, humor &amp; charisma of this band! This is a great live album, except for the TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY, but I rarely play it. (I actually got rid of it once, because it sounded so bad!) Whenever I want to hear Van Halen, my favorite band, I reach for the first 6 albums. After all, sales dwindled on each Hagar album. Doesn't that say it all?
B0000004V2|3.0|Having heard so much about this album, I was excited to hear it for the first time. And after many listens, im not convinced that its a work of genius as everybody thinks it is. Some of the songs are great - made of stone, she bangs the drums, and i am the resurrection are the obvious standout tracks for me. But this album lacks momentum...there is hardly any passion in the execution of these songs. In other words, if I want to listen to a high energy album, im not going to stick this in my cd player.<BR>I think the guitar work is uninspiring throughout - there is nothing innovative about using the wah wah pedal. The vocals are practically non existent; maybe this was a problem with the mixing of the album, or maybe Ian Brown just cant carry a tune (probably the latter). I am baffled as to why this is considered a classic...people always talk about this album like it was a `movement`, but when it comes down to it, its the songs that count, and theyre sub standard. I think if my expectations hadnt been built up quite so much then I would enjoy this a lot more...as it stands, its a good little album, but nowhere near as good as its cracked up to be.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Excellence.  Why or how many reviewers here failed to note or add that together stunning camera work, fine acting, deft pacing, intentional (not incidental) use of location, precise writing and character progression creates an incredible film is a bigger mystery than the 'whodunnit' involved in Gosford Park.  Yes, we have seen 'Upstairs, Downstairs' all of us, yet this is far more than a retred of a class tale.  Sex, power, & priviledge are explored with the long overdue understanding of gender as well.  Just when you think you know what this film is about, keep watching and think again.  While keeping track of the actual and temporary names of the characters rivals a Russian novel, this identity confusion serves to extend the scathing censure of classist/sexist foundations of a society rather than obscure the plot.  And frankly, it is not all that difficult.   A near flawless film.
0380733358|5.0|Ken Follett has done a wonderful job of centralizing the plot of a novel around the life and work of the bad-guy. Rather than write a typical \\"good-guy\\" spy-thriller, he has introduced a whole new view of the spy-thriller. The novel is remarkable and one of my top three favorites produced by Follett. His ability to write a novel about the enemy's number 1 spy was entertaining and, in my opinion, the hallmark of his writing career. <br />Nadel is a ruthless spy. No family no loved ones. Just the way he likes it. It allows him to concentrate on the matter at hand. Killing opposition spies. <br />This was absolutely amazing and a quick fun read. If you have read some of Follett's other books such as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", \\"Key to Rebecca\\", \\"A Dangerous Fortune\\", then you know what his style of writing is. Although different in content, his style is almost invented within these book covers. If you've read other works of Follett's, then you'll enjoy this book as being on par, but on a different course than those aforementioned.<br />Eye of the Needle is a unique spy-thriller well deserving of 5 stars. I would suggest those books above, along with this one if you're looking for a good weekend/vacation reading. Please see my reviews of the other novels as they may help you to choose which you want to read first. <br />Great Reading!!!
B00000ICD9|5.0|This movie is amazing! A perfect example of what true love is and the extent that people will go to to keep it alive.
B001AQMBHI|5.0|High school student Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) is heading on a high school graduation trip but he somehow has a mysterious psychic gift as he predicts that the plane will be destroyed. It scares some of his pals so much that they leave the plane and it finally came true, the survivors like his friend Tod (Chad Donella), teacher Ms Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke), his rival Carter (Kerr Smith) with girlfriend Terry (Amanda Detmer) and Billy Hitchcock (Seann William Scott) are scared of him because of his gift. It seems that the grim reaper himself known as Death wants to collect their souls and Alex gets advice from a coroner named Bludworth (Tony Todd) who knows about death itself and it can be cheated but it seems some of Alex's friends are getting offed one by bloody one as he must try to survive.<br /><br />A thrilling and bloody rollercoaster of a horror suspense thriller! this is the best movie out of the post-Scream era and launched one of the most shocking horror franchises in recent memory besides the Saw franchise. Writer/producer/director James Wong (\\"The X-Files\\" writer fame) with producer Glen Morgen has crafted a well made and very scary movie that takes you over the edge and right for the jugulear at times even with it's horrific gore. I also like how this approaches with a modernize version of the Stephen King book \\"The Dead Zone\\" with a little of \\"Scream\\" but without being ironic or comical. The acting is very good and the thrills never disappoint including the accident scenes, this movie is one of the best and most original horror movies of the new millenium and it's sequels are worth a look too.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray bring the movie to incredible picture and sound quality like never before with great extras like audio commentaries, isolated score with commentary by Shirly Walker the composer, additional scenes with alternate ending, 2 documentaries, a featurette and trailer.
B00005RHGL|4.0|Tombstone manages to finds its way into my DVD player on a monthly, if not weekly basis.  Certainly during poker games.  Kilmer as Doc Holiday is one of my favorite characters in movies.  Now, I'm aware that this is not the historically correct portrayal of the Earps and their encounter with the Cowboys, but I really don't care.  <BR>So why the four stars and ominous heading.  Well, this review is really about the Vista Series release of the movie.  Looking at the extras before this came out, I had to own a copy.  I even sold my other version to make room for this copy, which, of course, was going to knock me dead.  I mean, it has commentary and extra scenes. . . I could die and be happy.  <BR>Well, I'm alive. . . very much alive.  While I was really happy with Cosmatos' commentary (although I wish the some of the actors would have also been available), the added scenes did nothing for me.  Actually it's worse.  They really ruined the movie for me.  Not for all time!  Just during that viewing.  <BR>The extra scenes attempt to fill in some of the \\"blanks\\" that were missing from the original.  Such as, what happened to Kate in the second half of the movie?  How did one of Earp's \\"Immortals\\" get captured and dragged by a Cowboy behind his horse?  Where was Doc the night the Earps were attacked?  <BR>Well, I've seen the answers, and they stink.  They are simply not needed, which, you guessed it. . . is probably the reason they were cut from the original.  The scene between Kate and Doc that was added was the worst.  It simply did not fit in with the personalities of the characters up to that point.  In fact, it almost ruined Kilmer's performance for me.  <BR>Cosmatos, in his commentary, discussed a scene that did not make it in the original or this release.  It was actually an expansion of the Josephine and Wyatt scene in the valley after riding their horses.  Apparently, there was more of a \\"connection\\" than just the obvious attraction the two have in the version thatmade the film.  Actually, if you watch the trailers for the movie, you see a brief second where Wyatt and Josephine are kissing.  Cosmatos cut that scene to save time, and because he wanted to leave it up to the viewers imagination as to what really happened.  I wish the same had happened with the scenes they did decide to put back in.
B00000DCHI|5.0|This CD has got a lot of good, original Billy Joel songs.  I do agree though, it is missing some, but oh well!!  It's still worth getting.  Definitely something to add to your Billy Joel Collection!
B000067CQK|5.0|I'll be a little more positive than the 2 other reviews.<BR> We're not talking about the music of this one. Nothing<BR> else or new can be said about ''ziggy stardust''<BR> bonus cd doesn't bring anything interesting on the table,<BR> and usually will stay in their case forever after one<BR> boring listening. BUT this one bonus cd contains real<BR> great songs. [velvet goldmine is a glam jewel].The cover<BR> of 'Amsterdam' is really strong, so are other songs on <BR> this cd.<BR> Also contrary to one reviewer I like the fact that the bonus<BR> tracks are not on the same cd than the original ''ziggy''.<BR> It preserves the authenticity of the 1972 album.An ''original''<BR> album with 10 new bonus tracks is no longer the same album.<BR> Did I mention THE BEAUTIFUL packaging of these cds. 40 pages<BR> interesting to read and well presented.<br /> So I'll advise you to get this remarkable edition,and I would<BR> mind a special edition for ''aladin sane''. No, not let's dance<BR> By the way ,If you don t know ''hours' and ''heathen'',you<BR> are missing something.
B00005OAIE|4.0|&quot;Room for Squares,&quot; by John Mayer, is an awesome cd with a very laid-back sound.  John Mayer's great voice and guitar skills make you want to sit back and relax.  If you are a big fan of Dave Mattews, you'll love this one!  This cd is great to listen to when you are in the mood to just chill-out.  The only bad thing that I have to say about &quot;Room for Squares&quot; is that it would have been better if there were more guitar solos from him.  His style seems to be more in the blues catagory and I think that next time he should try to get away from the pop title.  I still have to say that John Mayer is a great artist and his cd proves that.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack and listen to it more times then I really need to. One thing that puzzles me is that the \\"I'll Fly Away\\" by Alison Krauss & Gillian Welch on the soundtrack is different then the one they play in the movie. If I am totally off, let me know. I would like to get a copy of that recording. Thanks and keep listening!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Baz Luhrmann has enthrallemed me again in this offbeat, fast paced musical. The tone of the movie was both exciting and devestating at the same time. Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor astounded me with their vocal performance through the whole movie and their harmony was amazing on &quot; come what may.&quot; There is no other director who has quite captured my attention in quite the same way. In short I was both impressed and left longing for the next film this man might make.
B000067CQK|5.0|This album was seminal in that it influenced so many other artists--we all know how influencial and important this album really is.  <br />I just want to point out that the Ryko version of this cd is no longer available.  It has been out of print for a quite a few years now and I therefore I never had the opportunity to buy the Ryko. <br />This CD is now the only version of the album that contains the extra tracks; it also contains a few that were not released on the Rydo disk.  Therefore, this version is not overpriced if you consider how much it now costs to buy the OOP Ryko (very expensive at auctions).<br />I only wish that they would treat all Bowie's albums as they did the 30th Anniversary Ziggy Release.
B00003CXB2|4.0|Now, while this movie isn't everyone's cup of tea (some find it too long, or not having enough action), this massive desert epic brings a famous (but somewhat minor) chapter of World War I alive (though it stops short of depicting the British breaking their promise to the Arab leader).<BR>The acting is excellent, and the music is some of the best to hit the cinema. &quot;Lawrence&quot; is a movie that everyone should try once, and one that will always be appreciated.
B00004XQ83|5.0|A wonderful way to get in touch with alternate forms of music that are especially important to Americana.  A refreshing change to the superficial music of today.
B00005QIPH|5.0|The prerelease hype and subsequent fawning meant The Strokes were going to have a tough time after their release, though they don't live up to the hype (but who honestly expected the Messiahs of Rock n' Roll?) they put out an amazing CD with understated vocals and catchy, mellow music. They are, however, the closest thing to a modern Velvet Underground we'll get.<BR>Enjoy &quot;Last Nite&quot;, &quot;Soma&quot;, and &quot;Is This It&quot;. Don't come into the album expecting it to fullfill the hype- but come in with an open mind and you'll be treated to a unique album.
038532653X|1.0|I thought that Skellig wasnt that good because it was boring and unoriginal, like a disney film. It the typical concept: boy goes to new place, boy finds mysterious object, boy makes friends with object, boy tells friend about object, object leaves. I think that it is boring. We have been reading it in class and every one else enjoyed it, so i think some people might like it, i also dont understand why it won the whitbread and coarnigie awards, i would rate it: Originality:2/10(it has some of this) Excitement:0/10(quick, we need life support!) Lifespan:0/10(beep, beep, beeeeeeeeee(dies)
0671027344|5.0|I've heard several people rave about this book, so I had to pick it up.  And I wasn't disappointed.  <BR>    It's told through a serious of letters from Charlie, a freshman in high school, to an anonymous person.  The novel is almost like a journal as Charlie reveals what he is experiencing and feeling.  He is the kind of person who thinks way too much, and neglects to really live in the moment.  He seems to be near depression most of the time, but a supportive teacher and two great friends help him. There's a little bit of everything in this novel- teen angst, teen love/lust, drugs, homosexuality...it's just an amazing piece of literature.  I highly recommend it.
B0000524E5|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever! It is a good story,a story that tell us to follow our dreams... I just say 1 thing to all the people that had [not] seen the movie... SEE IT!! It is just fabulous.
0316666343|4.0|I read Sebold's _Lucky_, a memoir about her rape, a few years ago, and I was looking forward to her first piece of fiction even without all the media hype.  <BR>    The story begins with the murder of a 14-year old girl,...   She tells of her murder,...  <BR>  My only issues with this novel deal with the ending....I can't reveal anything, as they would be huge spoilers.  I felt that some of the things that happened were just too weird and some of the events tied things up too neatly.  <BR>  On the whole, though, this was one of those novels you can't break away from.  I was sad to come to the end as I knew I would miss Susie.
B0000640VO|4.0|This film has already been lauded to the skies so I don't need to add my praise. Instead, I'll point out what I think is wrong with this film, namely, its blatant and gratuitous self-consciousness and smugness. It's most blatant every time Amelie looks directly into the camera and smiles her knowing smile. It's only a little less blatant in the frenetic camera work: from dizzying birds-eye crane shots to disconcerting tilted frame compositions, from high-angle shots to low-angle shots, the camera practically SCREAMS, \\"look at me!\\". Like the incompetent who has to blow his own horn because no-one else will do it for him, this movie tries too hard to draw attention to itself. If it were really as sweet as it wants us to believe it is, it wouldn't need to do this.<br />The only way around this indictment is if all this attention-seeking served some purpose other than horn blowing. The only purpose I can see is that the camera itself is a character in the film. Judging by the frequent use of high-angle and overhead shots, the obvious candidate is Fate or Destiny. The theme of falling and high places tends to support this idea. Think of the goldfish that was dumped out of its bowl and fell into the pond, or the woman from Quebec who jumped from the church steeple and fell on Amelie's mother, or the bar owner who was dropped by her trapezist lover and fell and broke her leg: these are all examples of the falling theme. Or think of the letters that were lost and discovered on the top of Mont Blanc, or the travelling gnome who flies with the airline stewardess, or Amelie herself, the 'agent' of Fate, who lives on the 5th floor, high above her fellow tenants: these are all examples of the high places theme. What all these images have in common is that Something from on high brought either tragedy or salvation to the people involved. It's as if Fate or Destiny was at work, bringing sadness or joy into people's lives. And the camera, which frequently takes the lofty overhead and high angle pov, is the apparent embodiment of this Fate or Destiny. And Amelie, when she looks into the camera, is really looking into the eyes of Fate, who she's in cahoots with, and saying, \\"hey Fate, did you like that! Wasn't that neat?!\\".<br />Well, there's a lot to recommend this view. Like the two themes discussed already. But there are scenes that contradict it. For example, the theatre scene when Amelie looks into the camera and says, \\"I like to look at the faces of people behind me!\\". The trouble here is that this scene happens before Amelie discovers her role as the agent of Fate. Who, then, is she talking to? The obvious answer is us, the audience. And why does she do this? Why, to draw attention to herself and how 'sweet' she is. And THAT'S the problem with this film.<br />It's as if between every few lines of this review I were to throw in a, \\"hey, aren't I clever?!\\", or a, \\"wow, ain't I smart?!\\". Rather than enhancing my argument it would obviously only detract  from it - big time. My argument should speak for itself. It doesn't need my attention-seeking, self-congratulatory remarks to help it.<br />Same thing with a movie. It should stand on its own without some character repeatedly ejaculating, \\"hey, look at me! Aren't I sweet?!\\". Far from adding anything, these outbursts actually serve to call attention to what's wrong with the film.<br />A good film, but not perfect. And certainly not one of the best films of all time!
B000066F6H|5.0|When you flip 'Veni Vidi Vicious' into your cd player for the first time, and listen to the first track, titled 'The Hives- Declare Guerre Nucleaire' you may realize the similarity of The Hives to the Rolling Stones. The great vocals, by &quot;Howlin'&quot; Pelle Almqvist, bring you back to the early days of rock n' roll, with a touch of punk lyrics. <br />&quot;Howlin'&quot; describes Almqvist perfectly. His truest screams of energy are mostly evident in 'Main Offender'. They seem to prove his anticipation for the next word he's going to say.<br /> My favourite track is 'Die, All Right!', which uses both Almqvist's strong vocals with background vocals to create a truly remarkable effect. <br />The enhanced part of this cd includes three of their latest videos from this cd. 'Die, All Right!', 'Main Offender', and the most popular, 'Hate To Say I Told You So'. <br />The only minus to this cd is its' playing time-less than 30 minutes. To counter that fact, though, each song is full of fast pace and energetic riffs.<br />If you think that these Swedes' invasion to North America's modern rock scene is just hype, give this cd a spin. Unlike The White Stripes and The Strokes, these guys are the real deal.

B0000633T6|3.0|This is a fairly by the numbers spy thriller but with better acting than usual.  Both Pitt and Redford give good performances but even so you don't feel to much for any of the characters and you can pretty much see all the plot twists and turns coming from a mile away.  That said this is not a bad nbit of entertainment for your dollar.  Much can be said for a decent director and some good acting.  If your into the spy thriller genre, and by the looks of Tom Clancys paychecks many people are, then this will please even the most discerning fan.
0790751089|3.0|This was a book I loved but the movie was disappointing.  I loved Clint as Robert, but Meryl really bothered me as Francesca.  She had a stilted, bizarre way of moving and talking (no, the accent wasn't convincing) and I just couldn't buy her as arousing such passion in Eastwood's character.  I still cried at the end when she had to make the choice. And I loved the music, much of which, I understand, was from Clint's collection.
B000067CPX|3.0|This record reminds me of the good old days when it sounded like the boys from SoCal actually enjoyed each others company. Sure only two original members remain but the spirit has endured and indeed flourished.  How many other bands out there show so much love for each other and have been through such trying times.  It shows in the music especially with this new record as the songs form a cohesive whole that makes this the best RHCP record in many years.  In the old days like Uplift Mofo the boys made up in energy what they lacked in musical apptitude, now they add the musical talent to back it up.
B000007S5B|4.0|I have read other reviews of this album that are quite mixed in opinion. I, for one, have always enjoyed this one throughout. Being that I am a die-hard Doors fan, this prejudices me to no end.<br />   All of the music in Waiting For The Sun is quite unique, and The Doors were never known for trying to be Top 40! \\"Hello, I love You\\" is a very good start, though the tune is precisely like \\"All Day and All of the Night\\" from another band. \\"Love Street\\" is a song devoted to Jim Morrison's love Pam. \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" is the only piece from the famous Celebration of the Lizard routine that was performed only in concerts. Apparently there were plans to put \\"Celebration\\" as a complete entity on here, but something obviously went wrong. \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\" is like a mournful surfing song. \\"Wintertime Love\\" has a carnival-like quality to it (note: the cassette version had a more studio-enhanced, clean version, while the CD has a raw Jim singing erratically). \\"Unknown Soldier\\" is a mesmerizing dig at the Vietnam War. \\"Spanish Caravan\\" is indeed quite Spanish in tone and instrument, a fun one this song. \\"My Wild Love\\" is a tuneful chant, quite Native American in spirit. \\"We Could Be So Good Together\\" and \\"Yes The River Knows\\" are standard Doors fare (meaning unusual, easy to hear, and hard to get the meaning of, if you're into meaning!) Both are rather short. Finally, there is the \\"long song\\" in \\"Five To One.\\" It is not that long, compared to other albums' signature pieces, and is another Vietnam dig.<br />   Overall, this album has a lot of short tunes. In fact, the album only runs a little over a half hour. It is an unusual listening, and I only recommend it for someone truly ready to move beyond a \\"Best Of\\" compilation. If you want a unique musical experience, stick this in the CD player, turn down or off the lights, close your eyes, and enjoy.
B000066NW0|5.0|All I can say is WOW! EVERYONE needs to buy this! It has a song for everyone, mellow, slow ones, and also, fast, rock driven songs that are awesome, AWESOME!! GET IT!
B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors as a quartet ended with this album. It seems that the band saved a lot of great ideas for this one. Sadly, Jim Morrison died in Paris around the time this album was released in 1971. Years of heavy drugs and constant drinking had taken its toll on Jim, and you can hear the effect on his voice. Yet, it made for some great singing. <br />   \\"The Changeling\\" is a great rock song, and is symbolic of Jim's transformation over the years. \\"Love Her Madly\\" is a Robbie Krieger piece, an ironic look at love. \\"Been Down So Long\\" is a great Doors piece where Jim utters a few mild oaths. \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" is a slow one. Not a love song, just SLOOWW, groovy... \\"L.A. Woman\\", the title track, is the first of 2 long ones (in fact I believe this is the longest Doors album at almost 50 minutes). This song is a classic by any rock standard. \\"L'America\\" is a Manzarek keyboard masterpiece at the start, then moves into what seems to be a tale of wealth-seeking in America. \\"Hyacinth House\\" is probably the weakest song on the album, as Jim is often off-key. 'Crawling King Snake\\", I believe, is a John Lee Hooker cover with more sound effects. \\"The Wasp\\"  has a great beat maintained by John Densmore. It is very enjoyable, but it is a classic Doors \\"Huh?\\" song that many fans have a theory on meaning-wise. Finally, there is \\"Riders on the Storm\\", the song that made me a Doors fan. It is a melancholy song that was well-placed on the album. It is as if Jim had some residual comments on life to make before finishing his own life months later. This is a song that works really well in a dark room or just at night period.<br />   A truly classic swan song for a band that was destined only to  be with us for a short 5-year period in terms of albums... This is a must for those who have been introduced to the band and want to hear lesser-played gems.
B0000024TT|5.0|When a friend of mine asked me to make a &quot;Best of Leonard Cohen&quot; CD for her, I had to fight the urge to simply copy this album for her and tack a few later gems like &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Hotel #2&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for the Miracle&quot; onto the end.  As an English scholar, I firmly believe that this man is the most evocative lyricist modern music has yet produced.  This album is not marred by the lackluster filler songs (think of &quot;Jazz Police&quot;) that his later albums contain.  For whatever reason, he has hit the mark with every song here, and when Leonard Cohen hits the mark it reminds me of why I believe humans create art in the first place.  My memories of this album are chiefly associated with hearing it while driving through Indiana in the middle of the night, with flatness all around me, smoking a whole pack of cigarettes in two hours and being unable to find a motel with any vacancy.  This album made me think, &quot;Someone else out there knows what I'm feeling and expressing it even better than I could.&quot;  And I felt more alive and human knowing that there was someone who I could make that emotional connection with.  And that is why I think humans create art.<br /><br />  Cohen's most sincere poetry is here, in songs like &quot;Suzanne&quot;, &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;, and &quot;Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye&quot;.  Somehow, while giving these women names and very specific personalities, Cohen paradoxically makes you feel that he is singing about the woman who just left you, or whom you just left.  This is not an album to listen to lightly or at parties, unless they're two-person wine-and-weep parties with your closest friend in the world.  It demands your attention in the same way that a whisper in a loud room can make everyone shut up and listen to who's whispering.<br />  I suppose this record is not for everyone, though I've never met anyone in that group.  Cynics, fans of simplistic pop lyrics, and those who dissect songs as if they were algorithms may want to look elsewhere.  But for anyone who's ever just felt alone, or who has realized too late that all love ends, or anyone young who thinks that no one understands their desire to run off into a field at midnight and just scream because there's so much pain in the world, this is a record to own.  Trust me, Leonard feels the same way.  And that, somehow, makes it just a little bit easier to take.s, and those who dissect songs as if they were algorithms may want to look elsewhere.

B000002I2I|5.0|This album came in 1970, a year after The Soft Parade debacle.  They dropped the orchestra and decided to do some decidedly bluesy songs. The result is an AWESOME comeback. Jim Morrison had his legal problems still, but the band really got it together this time. This is their best since Strange Days, 3 years earlier. <br />   \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is always a bar favorite, even if it's not a Doors version. \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" seems to be a scrap from the album of the same name that did not originally make the cut. It is a good song that features great guitar work. \\"You Make Me Real\\" features some great keyboard work while Morrison really belts his voice out. \\"Peace Frog\\" and \\"Blue Sunday\\" have separate tracks, but flow as one song. The former is about blood and death, while the latter is a song devoted to Jim's love Pam. Both are a fantastic listening. \\"Ship of Fools\\" is a good one featuring good Manzarek keyboard. \\"Land Ho!\\" is a great one about the sea. \\"The Spy\\" features some great solo guitar work. \\"Queen of the Highway\\" is a strange but enjoyable one (a classic \\"This is great, but what's it about?\\" Doors song, one of many). \\"Indian Summer\\" is a second slow love song, equally enjoyable as \\"Blue Sunday\\". \\"Maggie M'Gill\\" finishing off the album, is a very bluesy song that has Jim throwing his alcohol-strained voice with all his might.<br />   This is an album to own if you want a great Doors experience. Like I said, it certainly has a blues theme laced through most of the tracks. The band has its instrumental expertise at full-throttle once again.
B00005JLDW|3.0|You will enjoy this fire breathing suare .  How did Matthew McConaughey get famous?  Christian Bale get's no ass in this movie because he doesn't play any Genesis.  Some T and A would have been nice.  Christian and Matthew go to London for a few days.  Hasta La Vista Dragons!  Basically, they have to kill the male dragon, the biggest doofus in London.  Mathhew McConaughey drinks hard water, and throws quite a battle axe.  LONDON! GOOD LUCK!
B000002I2G|3.0|I will say right off the bat that this is the weakest Doors album. And yet, I give it 3 stars. If anyone is interested in Doors history, this one came out in 1969, the year Jim Morrison experienced some serious legal problems. This is also a short album, going just over a half hour (similar to Waiting For The Sun). The first side contains the only song that charted, &quot;Touch Me&quot;. Other than that, tracks 1,3,4 and 5 are good songs, but rather unmemorable. What weakens the first 5 tracks (Side A) is an orchestra backup,an experiment that doesn't work well with this band. &quot;Wild Child&quot; on track 6 sounds as if Jim had just finished a bottle and gotten a fresh wind. It also sounds like the orchestra had been ditched for that one. &quot;Runnin' Blue&quot; is a great one, though there are signs of the orchestral background. This one is too short. &quot;Wishful Sinful&quot; is a classic Jim Morrison love song (his are by no means wine and roses and whininess). Finally comes the long title piece &quot;The Soft Parade&quot;, which has many stages. It starts with a vibrant oration, then a slow musical start, slowly rising to pure Doors mayhem by the end. A fun journey this song.<br />   I do not really recommend this album for someone wanting a Doors experience, not even for one ready to move beyond the Best-Of stage. This one is for the true fan who takes the band for better or for worse. I liked this one for tracks 6 through 9 only, the others are not bad, but not the best by any means.
B00005M1CO|5.0|Elvenking is a fairly new metal band out of Italy, and as such I would expect nothing like this album.  They are very unlike other Italian metal bands in that their style is Folkmetal, at least that is what Elvenking this best describes their own music, and I would be inclined to agree.<br />First off, few albums deserve a 5 star rating.  Though I had a hard time deciding what to rate this album, I gave it 5 stars for several reasons:<br />First, every song on this album is worth at least 4 stars on its own.  Every other one I would call great, and this is most of them.<br />Second, Elvenking displays a surprisingly wide range of skills in this one album.  Combining folk and metal is something of an accomplishment in itself, and listening to this album makes me think 'How come I haven't heard anyone else do this before?'  The tracks range from heavy guitars (The Dweller of Rhymes) to more melodic tracks (Hobs and Feathers) to tracks featuring primarily guitar and fiddle (Skywards) to purely instrumental (To Oak Woods Bestowed), and yet they all work together very well (that is to say, they all feel like they belong on the same album, which might not be expected from such different tracks).  <br />Third, many metal bands have been known to mix deep, growling male vocals with softer female vocals for an interesting contrast (Nightwish come to mind here).  While many bands do this and it sounds 'interesting', Elvenking manages to mix several different distinct vocals and it sounds amazing.  White Willow has a verse sung with male vocals and growling male vocals singing the same words together, and the result is the feeling that the character being portrayed in the song is showing much more intense emotion.  The most notable track in this sense, however, is the final track, Seasonspeech.  This track has four different vocal parts (clean male vocals, growling male vocals, and two very different female vocals), one for each season.  They sing separately at times, togetherat times, and some times they are all singing their own verses.  The last time I heard anything like this done this well was Simon and Garfunkle's Scarborough Fair.  The effect is quite astonishing.  Rather than just being an interesting mix they work together and complement each other in a way that probably can't really be described in words.<br />Overall, this is an amazing album.  If you are looking for something new and fresh in metal, this is an excellent investment.
B0000640VO|5.0|&quot;A Quai&quot; music video is not on the dvd, yet it is listed on this page! I really wanted to see that too... grrrr
B00000G3Q4|4.0|This whole series is absolutely excellent! However, the first has the absence of comedy and is packed with scary scenes. Sam Raimi has done a marvelous job scarring the hell out of me with this low-budget nightmare. This movie is an absoulte must for any horror fan, and i also recommend getting Evil Dead 2 and Army Darkness. <BR> The second and third films have quite a bit of funny scenes in them and they made Bruce Cambell turn into a \\"Cult-Film-Hero.\\" However this first film is a triumph in every sence of the word. Stop Reading and reviews and buy it already!
B00003CXTG|4.0|I was genuinely suprised at how good Pearl Harbor was, based on the fact that most reviews were negative. I thought the acting was good, especially from Kate Beckensdale and Ben Affleck. How much research and money went into this movie is apparent as you see the magnifecent Pearl Harbor in 1942- and view it being destroyed. Yes, I know more time than was needed was spent on the love story/triangle thing, and that's why this didn't get 5 stars. Basically, I think this is as good as Hollywood gets- at least in direcion and special effects, anyway. The attack scene will blow you away.
B000009QPG|2.0|This is a pretty decent Slayer release, it sort of bridged the gap between the old school (Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Hell Awaits era) with what was to come, the more non-satanic Divine Interention, Diobolus in Musica, and God Hates Us All Albums. <br />As a Satanist since 1981 when Venom's \\"Black Metal\\" was released, I found Seasons in the Abyss to be dissapointing in that Satan was only mentioned in \\"Born of Fire\\" and \\"Temptation\\", apprarently only at the insistence of Rick Rubin. I prefer the more satanic and evil earlier material Slayer has, such as Hell Awaits and Show no Mercy. From a heavy metal standpoint, however, this is a good introduction to what Slayer has to offer.
B00005JKL8|4.0|Behind Enemy Lines is an entertaining and intelligent action/thriller starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson. Wilson stars a man in the military who's plane goes down &quot;behind enemy lines&quot;, and Hackman is his superior desperatly trying to get him to safety. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, and suprised me with a few twists. Definitley a great film, I would give it four and a half stars if possible. This movie is worth your time and money for sure, even if you buy it on DVD.
B00005221L|4.0|At the time of buying, Predator was only available in Britain in a hopeless edited version, missing all kinds of scenes and snippets. I thought i would invest in the region 1 version to get the full cut. I was not disapointed, with the film. The sound however, still does not sound quite right. Jungle hisses in the background sometimes come and go mid scene as different characters speak, and some of the explosions are not quite perfect. Then again, this is one of my favourite movies, so i'm going to be picky. <BR>It has little in the way of extras: one trailer, and no moving menu's etc.<BR>If you just want a good quality version of the film with no fuss, then this is a good value version.<BR>Now though, a special edition uncut two disc version has just been released in the UK, with all kinds of extras and bits on it in a flashy box. \\"sigh\\" I wish Fox would get it right first time and stop costing me so much cash. ....<BR>Third time lucky!
B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde stars Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods, a very stereotypical blonde who's obsessed with her boyfriend Warner. When he dumps her and goes to Harvard, she decides she can make it in to and prove that she's smarter than him, which will make him want her back.<BR>Well, things go wrong for Elle in an imaginative and always humorous way; Reese Witherspoon gives an Oscar-worthy, energetic performance that I won't soon forget. This movie has a good message and great ending, and is definitely one of the best films of 2001.
1559408898|4.0|The Criterion collection version of this film is definately worth having if you're a fan of this film. Right from the outset the menus are excellent and laid out just right. There are all sorts of extras on this disc with no end of little trivia bits to amuse friends with. The uncut version of the film gives it a whole new novelty, and the commentry explains why scenes were edited and so on. There is quite a good box set available in the UK with all three films on, but if, like me you thought the other two were naff, then get this DVD. Its pakaging is classy and it is even signed on the front by Paul Verhoven to say its unrated!<BR>The only thing that lets it down a little, is the sound is not in full 5.1. It is in surround though, and you'd be hard pressed to know that it wasn't 5.1. How good does ED209's feet sound thudding at full volume!
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|Finally the movie that should have been released in the first place. Many feel the love triangle in the first 90 minutes was horrible to the film. I felt that it was a good fictional starting place to put characters in a historical situation. <BR>Getting to the purpose of the film. &quot;The Attack&quot; this is where I was disappointed in the original politically correct release. The additional footage showed just how brutal and horrific the attack was, and the true emotion that our boys must of been feeling. Tom Sizemore's character calling a Jap pilot a few choice words. The strafing of the sailors in the water and being blown to peices, the body parts on the hospital floor. This tugged at my emotions and made me feel much more like I felt when I saw &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. This showed the true brutality of war, within reason, and made you realize the triumph of spirits our grandparents showed. God Bless America.

0140380221|4.0|\\"Little Women\\" is like the best vanilla ice cream-simple, sweet, pure, and something that always seems good, no matter what else you read (or eat!). As most of you know, \\"Little Women\\" is the chronicle of the four March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) and their family, as they grow up in 1860's New England. Part autobiography, it is easy to see why it has become the classic it is.<br />Sure, the \\"slang\\" is noticeably dated, the writing style is definitely \\"1800's\\", but the characters are what really makes this book great. Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.<br />\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.<br />\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time). Still, when confronted with the sheer warmth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults.mth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|ok i'm not going to waste time writting what it was about everyone does that. what i will tell you is that i was completly blown away by this debut film. i could not take my eyes off of it! it is cinimaticly beutiful!the story is complex yet engrossing.  i watched it and than watched again that night.  since than i have rented it several times, and everytime i watch it's mystery is solved alittle more.  the entire end is in the movie in one way or another you just have to be clever enough to pick up on it.<BR>Most likey my pick for movie of the year knocking Memento out of first place!
0380018179|5.0|This is the deepest love story I've ever read about. More so than Romeo and Juliet, Lancelot and Guinevere, etc. The intensity is unmatched. <br />I think it's because the beginning of their love starts so early, when Meggie is a 10 year old girl, somewhat neglected by her family. Ralph is a father figure to her for years, the only one there to care about her and help her grow up. So the foundation of the relationship is that of a vulnerable little girl and a protective man who's moved by her vulnerability. Then she becomes a beautiful young woman and their relationship is transported into another dimension. <br />The intensity is also related to the fact that the passion has to be suppressed for so many years. Ralph has never been with a woman before, and when they finally come together because he cannot suppress his feelings any longer, it must be the most powerful experience imaginable. All that together- deep love and attraction plus denied passion festering over years and years- then finally being able to let go and express it all. It would be uncontrollable and ecstatic. <br />I saw the miniseries before I read the book and was very moved by it. It was breathtaking. Especially the melody, which is incredibly haunting.
B000002J20|5.0|Truly fabulous music! The last time I listened to this album with such delight was back in 1975. It's amazing, but all the images - the thoughts and feelings my soul conjured up back then have all begun to peek around the unlit corners of my mind, each rubbing its eyes unsure that there is light in the room once again. <br />YES is one of those `concept' groups that were never afraid to &quot;compose&quot; their music. (YES was the group that led me as young teenager to develop an appreciation for classical music.) A large part of this is due to the fact that record companies back then were committed to nurturing their artists, a tradition now clearly dead and buried. Unfortunately, my children will have nothing new and `earth-shattering' on their own horizons to come to know as long as all the new music published by record companies today is geared to selling units rather than lifting spirits to higher creative thinking. But alas, their enjoyment of YES, ELP, early Genesis, Pink Floyd, the Beatles, etc. is nothing to be sorry about. Peace!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Like art-brit rockers Pink Floyd before them, Radiohead's OK Computer is a sign of Radiohead mastering of the recording studio. Utilizing every possible studio technique, this CD is a completely engrossing auditory experience. From the pedantic Paranoid Android to the spacy, dream-like feel of No Suprises, OK Computer covers a wide territory of sounds. The good news is that they do it well with the wealth of the songs on here being of the highest quality. The bad news is that there are a few slipping points(The Tourist is only okay in compareson to the rest of the album and Clawing At The Walls is just not very good).<br />Heavily emersed in 70's dream rock akin to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon and Wish You Were Here, OK Computer is heavy on disonnance instead of bombast associated with today's current crop of &quot;music&quot;. While this isn't to say that there isn't a few rockers on here(Airbag, Electroneering, and act III of Paranoid Android are pretty rockin' if you ask me), but the most of the songs here play to light chords with a sprinkiling of piano all played to the nervousness of Thom Yorke's signature shakey voice. While all the instruments are played to this effect, the multitude of layers make for an all-encompassing release. But even beyond the production, the musicianship is air-tight which makes the CD all the more listenable. Lyrically, this is the last of RH normally releases but yet hints of the opaqueness to come. A few listens are required just to understand what Yorke is singing, much less understand what he is getting at. In fact, you need to hear the entire CD a couple of times through to completely appeciate what Radiohead has crafted here.<br />But saddly, Radiohead's songcraft isn't without a few holes. There are a few soft spots and some inconsistencies that hurt the momentum of the record(it really becomes noticable after Electroneering). But don't be discouraged. The first 6 songs are of masterpiece quality and there are some gemsnear the end(No Suprises and Lucky are damn good songs, but no where near the first 6 quality). This is essential brit-rock listening. Fans of Pink Floyd will certainly hear the homage being payed but also will discover that there is also a distinctive sound of their own as well. A landmark release who will eventually go on and alienate most of their fans from this record(thank you Kid A. I love you!). God bless Radiohead!
6304169558|5.0|The house rips apart piece by piece. Tractors fall down like bombs. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton star in this movie as tornado chasers.

B00005RFAI|4.0|This chick is all dat!!<BR>When I hear the groove of &quot;Let's Get This Party Started,&quot; as well as Pink's well thought out lyrics, I can't help but jump up and down with energy.<br />And I thought Britney was the Queen of Pop!!  Boy was I ever fooled.  Unlike Britney and so many other pop star divas, Pink sings from her heart, shoots from her hip, keeps it real and basically busts out any other cliched phrasing you can think of. What I'm trying to say is:<br />The girl knows how to work it!!<br />You go, girl!!<br />This album is all that...plus a bag of chips.  If you don't believe me, check out the intro.<br />PEACE OUT!!
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this cd, and I can't wait for the new one to come out! It is soooooo much better than your usual rap, cause it doesn't cuss at all, it doesn't talk about stuff you don't really need to know, and it has some rock and hip hop added into the rap part. <br />Even though most of the songs are depressing it is a nice break from all the lovish junk. The word love is barely mentioned (just barely). EEEE! I love this cd o so much!
B00005221M|5.0|The Last of the Mohicans caught my eye when I first saw it on TBS about 4 years ago.   I don't know what it was exactly.  On the whole, the cast is filled with relative unknowns, other than Lewis and Stowe.  Perhaps what did it, and this is thanks to the auther James Fennimore Cooper is that this may be the only film where the colonial British are portrayed as victims, and not their typical bad guy persona that we see in most Revolutionary and French and Indian War movies (The Patriot is a perfect example)  Now the Brits still have a bad side to them, but without ruining too much of a sub-plot, lets just say they aren't standing very tall in the end.  However this movie is so much more than just British vs. French.  <BR>  This movie can be separated into sections.  The first being the 3 Mohican traveleres finding the Munro Daughters and a British Colnel.  The next being  the time in Fort Henry.  And the next being a final confrontation between the Huron Indians and the main characters.  Each section was executed flawlessly with the exception of the first one being a bit slow.  The acting was top notch, the music was incredible, and the location of this film was amazing.  Overall this was a definite snub for the Oscar's.  It just goes to show you that not every high priced movie needs a megastar.  The final 20 minutes of this movie alone should make you purchase this DVD.  A 10/10
B000002KIT|4.0|This is a good ive cd. It's not quite as great as some make it out to be but like all good live cd's it has some performances on it which out do the album version's of some songs: specifically on this cd Johnny the fox meets jimmy the weed and still in love with you. Some of the weaker performances on it are the rocker and baby drives me crazy. It had for the time a new song oni called are you ready which is a good song
0316666343|4.0|I became immersed in the story and lost track of time, by the time I finished this book my day was over! I liked how I felt so engaged in the story that I didn't think too far ahead and try to predict the ending like I often do. However, seeing how Susie's family and friends struggled and failed to return to a normal life gave me a feeling of emptiness. They never could seem to find comfort in things that could truly bring healing into their lives. This feeling became even stronger as I read about Susie's heaven. God was never mentioned. I figured if God is anywhere at the very least He would be in heaven! Needless to say, I thought Susie's heaven was strange and wondered if atheists view the afterlife this way. Overall a haunting book, it put me in a pensive mode the days after.
B000066I6N|5.0|One hour of listening made me to forget everything except charming whispering voice of Robert Plant. It is not just a rock music. It is much more than rock music. It is the answer why do I love old rock of 60-70`s and do not like new modern rock. One can hear the difference. Old rock is made of soul. New rock (no matter good or bad) is made of computer.<BR>12-string guitar acoustic sound followed by deep bass in &quot;Darkness...&quot; reminded me the time of Led Zep`s Kashmir.<BR>Plant voice did not change including his &quot;...o-o-o-h baby...&quot; and &quot;...tell me mama...&quot;  and &quot;...o-o-o-h yeah...&quot;. There is no reason for him to shout loud. Just whisper. And all other guitar and drum sounds follow his voice.<BR>He makes new sounds. He makes new style putting together rock`n`roll, rythm and blues, soul and jazz.<BR>Finally, after listening I can proudly say that Rock is more alive than dead! Thanking Robert Plant for that.
B000056H24|4.0|Notorious for Charlton Heston and John Wayne, The Greatest Story gets unfair treatment due to several items that could be improved: Length:Look at \\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"The Great Escape\\", \\"The Ten Commandments\\". Epic movies are supposed to be long. Of course some more dramtic action could have helped.<br />Actors: Most of the actors are great in their roles: Claude Rains, Jose Ferrer, Dorthy McGuire, Sidney Poiter, Roddy McDowell and of course, Charlton Heston as John the Baptist. On the other hand, some are a stretch, and then there's John Wayne.<br />Scenery: Beatiful scenery. Why be upset that it isn't the war torn Holy land? However, just because John Wayne is in it, doesn't mean parts of it had to be shot in John Ford's Monument Valley.<br />Jesus: Played with reverance by Max Van Sydow who could use contacts, long dyed dark hair, and a tan to fit the ethnic.<br />Music: Alfred Newman's score is great. I love Handel's Messiah, but Stevens got a little carried away with it.<br />Over all, a great movie with a lot of sincerity whose weakness are its strengths. The DVD contains some nice extras, a good documentary, and then a bad documentary that is a [spin] off of the first one. The producers should be crucified for not showing the deleted scenes cut from the movie, about an hour's worth.
B0000640VO|2.0|This review is to help young gentlemen such as myself.  Through the viewing of this film I have experienced no small amount of pain and, in these trying times, I feel it is my duty to save my fellow brethren from such a fate.  My suggestion... stay away from this life sucker.  This is a chick flick about a self-obsessed high maintenance hoochie-mama.  If it was starring Julia Roberts and was set in New York, you wouldn't touch it with a ten foot loaf of French bread.  Don't let the art house cloak fool you, this film will cause you pain.  It seems there are many people out there who enjoy watching this character run around for 2+ hours (in France) acting real cute, hence the stack of good reviews.  Hell, even I was curious.  But to me it felt like 5 hours of, albeit beautifully shot, trite French torture.  Some women will implore you to see this film.  Ignore them!  You may also want to carefully examine said women, as they probably feel akin to the heroin, and trust me, having a space cadet like Amelie in your life could only cause you harm in the long run.  If a man (or dude, depending on were you come from) recommends this film, slowly back out of the room so as not to arouse suspicion.  Once extricated from this potentially dangerous situation, run to the nearest phone an report him to the FBI.  My understanding is that they're keeping a list of these people \\"just incase\\".
B0000024SI|5.0|There are layers to these songs Dylan himself probably has no idea about, and the way you interperet any given song says more about you than about him...Dylan himself is content to let his songs stand, he rarely comments on what they \\"mean\\", and that's probably the wisest course of action. Highway 61 is the road Dylan took to get from Minnesota to New York to start his career, and there are lyrics that can be read that way, but going over his words with a biography and a dictionary only distances you from his REAL meaning, which is just to rock you from head to foot.<BR>The only real hit here is \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", which is featured on probably every greatest-hits package you could find, so why buy this album? Because it's a story, a journey, one of the most complete rock albums of all time. All the 9 songs are long and intricate, ranging from genuine rockers (\\"Tombstone Blues\\") to early-Dylan-style acoustic (\\"Desolation Row\\"), and all with the brilliant wordplay that MIGHT mean something autobiographical or might not. Who knows? Who cares? Just listen, man!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I saw this movie expecting a film about a young man with problems and the movie jsut peeking into his mind. I had no idea that the movie would go into so many concepts and make some very interesting points. I was amazed at how the movie could capture you and make the veiwing so intense that you almost felt what the main character was felling.<BR>My only problem with this film was the casting. I dont Drew Berrymore belonged in this film ( not that she was bad, there are just people to fit that role)Patrick Swayze was a small character in this film, but vital. I really enjoyed seeing him in a film again.<BR>This was an very interesting movie and I suggest it to anyone who is intrested darker sorts of movies.
B000066I6N|5.0|Dreamland is fast becoming my favorite album in years. It has the occasional feel of The Principle of Moments and Shaken 'n Stirred, but is still new and exciting. I was in from the first notes of Funny In My Mind, a great, fast-paced blues tune set off with a touch of zydeco. He has taken soulful possession of the old classic, Morning Dew. And I'm sure the song is happy with the arrangement. One More Cup of Coffee, Song to the Siren, Darkness Darkness and Red Dress are full of surprises and all of them very pleasant. His arrangement of Hey Joe is strange and wonderful, almost [Asian], but also a bit futuristic. And for the Zeppelin fans, there is Skip's Song, which is reminiscent of some of the good old tunes from the good old days. Altogether, I would give this album a sky full of stars because it is obviously a labor of love. I am curious about one thing, however, and that is the meaning of the cryptic words printed on the liner. Elvish? There are a lot of consonants involved. I'm sure someone will enlighten me eventually.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco has already established their ability to write intelligent folky-pop songs, so no need to dwell upon that.  It's the production, engineering and mixing that really set this album apart and make it an instant classic.  Songs begin as sparse and disconnected before becoming incredibly full and lush, and then end with layers of background noise.  Yet somehow the showy production and subtle song-writing manage to hold hands and complement each other rather than stepping on each others toes.  Even on your 100th listen, long after you've memorized the lyrics and are singing-along, listening the symphony of stings, random percussive instruments, plucked piano strings and layers of noise remains one of life's simple pleasures.  This is simply as good and interesting as music can get.
079073382X|5.0|This film is wonderful.  The dialouge and the acting is very real and believable, you feel like you're a voyeur rather than a regular film viewer.  <br />However, like most indie films its not for everyone.  The pace is slow, and there is no big 'whodunit' plot or a 'wacky car chase'.  The plot is simple: two strangers are getting to know each other for one night only.  The film is pure dialouge.<br />i'll put it this way:  if you liked &quot;Magnolia&quot;, there is a good chance you'll like this film.  They are both 'slice of life' films.  However, Magnolia has alot more action than Before Sunrise.<br />In other words, if you like dialouge films, don't sleep on 'Before Sunrise'.  Its beautiful!
B000002MP2|5.0|Don't deny it.  You once owned a copy of this CD and it rocked your world.  It was all you listened to back in the day.  It's very mention brings back fond memories of a younger you back in 1994, listening to alternative radio.  You've grown up now though, you've long since sold your copy to a used CD store and moved on to better things.  Perhaps indie rock, for some of you, perhaps emo for you hipsters or maybe some of you got into jam bands.  You're still a music lover and your thinking that Green Day was completly talentless; just a bad rip off of the Ramones.  Besides, the Mr. T Experience was ten times as good and never met with the same success.<br />Well, get over it.  This CD was so popular because it was pretty excellent; one of the more consistent punk CDs ever released, actually.  Listen to it again... buy it from a used CD store, or order it, but you'll be pleasantly surprised.  You'll find that eight years ago your taste in music wasn't all that bad anyway.
B000063V8R|5.0|For me this is the lynchpin season upon which ST:TNG pivots. It looks back to the first two seasons, improves upon what is good there, develops our main characters much further, and fixes what was &quot;broke&quot; (Wesley saving the Enterprise every third story is no more!). Season 3 sets several trends upon which the remaining four years will be based. Worf's saga of dishonor and subsequent redemption is begun in &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;. Patrick Stewart carrying a whole hour practically by himself begins with the first among several memorable Picard stories in &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot;. Although Data cannot feel heartache, we can as he creates a child android with painful consequences in the moving &quot;The Offspring&quot;. Even Q gets a decent story in this season as he becomes less of an eye-rolling annoyance and more of a real character. And of course, we have the first of many season cliff-hangers to come, &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;!
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is the stupidest movie ever. If you have not seen it you are not even worth talking to. You do not exist!
0811826848|5.0|This is great - at last parallel histories of the group written by the four people actually involved. Their memories may be starting to fade a bit, but this is always going to be definitive and more reliable even than those closest to the group. This is an excellent introduction to the Beatles' history for those who know very little about them, just as it is a must-have for fans who know just about everything about them.<br />There are some new pictures, but most as well-known to fans, and the book itself is a little unweildy, but these are minor niggles.
B00004W19V|5.0|Short Circuit is one of those movies that when it came out in 1985 I remembered walking out thinking what a fun film that was. Alley Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg were a great screen team. And fresh of Saturday Night Fever ad Wargames, director John Badham really showed the compassionate side of humanity. This is a warm and friendly family film for everyone.<br />The plot is simple - aren't they all? The military develops a device meant for war and `first strike' and decides to take it to the officials of the government for funding. Five very unique and laser-powered robots are built. Something happens to one of them, \\"Number 5\\", during the demonstration where an electrical storm creates an electrical surge and super jolts Number 5. Guess what? He comes alive! Complete with a personality and a small amount charm. He escapes (accidentally) and befriends an animal activist Stephanie (Sheedy) while Newton (Guttenberg) is assigned to chase him down and get him back.<br />Now add the adversary of the military trying to destroy him and you've got a great chase movie. Filled with laughs, bits, gags and a few scene stealing lines, this movie makes you believe that Number 5 IS alive! Some great supporting character roles and a lot of technically puppetry that would make even George Lucas jealous - the energy in this movie is great.<br />The DVD extras include a commentary with the director and writers as well as the original 1985 interviews with cast and crew. This is definitely a fun family film and something everyone who likes science fiction and fantasy mixed together will enjoy this a lot!
B00005NP04|5.0|Back in the early 90's, when Martina McBride was just getting started on a national level, I bought one of the first country albums I've ever owned.  It was &quot;The Way That I Am&quot;--a great album, full of to-be hits.  Three of the songs from that album made it here, on her Greatest Hits compilation, including &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which was really her breakthrough hit.<br />Through the years, I've become even more impressed with her vocal ablilities.  Martina has one of the most distinctive voices in modern country.  This CD will not disappoint if you're even a moderate Martina fan.  From fun songs like &quot;Life #9&quot; to &quot;When God-Fearin' Women Get The Blues&quot; (a new song released with the CD) to more issue-based tracks like &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Love's The Only House&quot; and &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; her very best work is right here on one CD!<br />Even the sweet song, &quot;Valentine&quot; she did with new age pianist, Jim Brickman, is here.  But, the one song that she has on here that impressed me the most is new.  It's called &quot;Where Would You Be&quot;--a song that is destined to be a Top 10 hit.  It shows off the soaring range of her soprano voice.  It is a gut-wrenching song that she pulls off so much better than any of her pop diva counterparts have ever managed.  I've since seen/heard the video for this song, which she taped live.  It is an experience.  This 5'4&quot; waif with piercing blue eyes can sing with such power like few I've heard.<br />Martina McBride sings with a great deal of passion that draws you to her music.  This is a performer who is the full package--not just a creation of Nashville.  You won't go wrong purchasing her Greatest Hits CD.
B000065U1N|2.0|Blackhawk Down is another war film that graphically depicts the terrors of war. This film was extremely graphic and detailed. After a while it became a little intense for me.<br />It tells the tale of the real mission that was taken upon by the US in the mid 90's. And it failed. The men, the mission and the principals were upheld, but many lives were very brutally lost. The film shows compassion, strength and brotherhood but it also shows the demonic terroristic nature of man.<br />Ridley Scott directed this piece with a lot of care and concern and it shows, but to the general audience it was just too much for me. There are really not even notable performances. The cast was so large not everyone had enough to say to develop anything really interesting for the audience. The action and special effects are large and broad however. From model helicopters to great body part effects - this movie doesn't hide anything.<br />The DVD has a few neat extras. Besides the commentary and the documentary they have some sequences that show you the various angles of the action sequences, that was definitely interesting and educational to watch. Overall its good to rent, but I wouldn't purchase this one.
6305907145|5.0|I have read Mansfield Park no less than 6 times and seen this movie at least that many.  The movie is wonderfully done and highly entertaining, though it is not an exact representation of the novel.  I find the other reviews interesting.  It's true that Patricia Rozema took some liberties with this adaptation, but I certainly don't agree with some other reviewers that the only similarity between the book and the movie are the names of the characters.  It is the same story, though the screenplay's Fanny Price is based more on Rozema's interpretation of what Jane Austen herself may have been like.  She gives Fanny the thoughts, emotions and writings of Jane Austen herself.  If you have the time, watch the commentary by Rozema on the DVD.  It really explains her interpretation of the novel and includes many facts about Jane Austen's life.  The BBC's Pride & Prejudice, very true to the novel and very enjoyable for me, moves too slowly for the average moviegoer and is too long to watch at one sitting.  Mansfield Park will entertain the average person and perhaps spark interest in her writings.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have become as reliable as U2 and REM in the past two decades. Like the other two bands, TRHCP have straddled the fine line of making broadly appealing music without exactly losing their souls to corporations. Yes, \\"By The Way\\" sounds like their most commercial cd to date, but as fans we have their first four cds that were not commercial to reflect on. I don't think the band is completely commercial anyway, and I don't they could be. I mean, my father wouldn't buy \\"By The Way\\". Instead, the band is attracting new, younger listeners while keeping many of the old fans. With that said, \\"By The Way\\" is a solid recording with the band's usual range of offerings from \\"By The Way\\", \\"Universally Speaking\\", \\"The Zephyr Song\\", \\"Cabron\\" and the rest of the 12 other tracks. The cd holds together very well, staying consistent throughout. Some might say this is a continuation from \\"Californication\\" and they'd be right. \\"By The Way\\" has the same lush feeling, the same maturity and growth in song structure and lyrics. The band is at the beginning of greatness I believe, with many more cds ahead that in years to come will be as classic as any U2 or REM cd.
B000002UAU|5.0|That's right, I said overrated. Don't worry, I've got no axe to grind, I just hate seeing any album called &quot;The Best Ever&quot;. Because, really, music is such a subjective topic that calling anything the best is a mistake.<br />This was the album that changed the Beatles sound forever, and took many people along with it. The impact of the album in 1967 was profound, although in retrospect it is almost inevitable that an album of this caliber would be released. <br />The material:<BR>13 songs, one of which is a reprise. 13 songs that don't seem like they all go together, but they somehow work very well. People often believe this to be a &quot;concept&quot; album (whatever that means) because the introduction and the finale point to it being a show of some type. While this is true of those tracks, most of the rest of the album is a collection of songs, not related to the rest of the tracks. <br />The music has tones and textures that simply cannot be replicated. The Beatles would play the same tune on several different instruments and combine the sounds to make new sopunds that cannot be replicated. They used studio wizardry in a variety of ways to create an ambience that can best be described as enchanting.<br />This cd release is pretty satisfying, but there are some problems, none of which particularly detract from the music.<br />- The album was mastered to cd in 1987. CD technology was five years old then. The format and analog/digital conversion have come a long way since then, and the album could be substantially improved sound-quality-wise with a new remastering effort.<br />- The album was originally mixed for mono and stereo. This cd represents the stereo version which, while good, is not necessarily the best. The mono version has sounds and mixzes that differ strikingly from the stereo version, and is perhaps a more accurate reflection of the Beatles vision. However, most people in the U.S. probably bought the stereo version, and hearing the mono version could be a jarring experience. It could also be a novel experience, as music that you have know for up to thirty-five years is suddenly different, and new! I would like for EMI/Apple to release both versions some day in the future.<br />If you enjoy music, and pop, and rock, then buy this album and enjoy!
B000068QY7|3.0|What's going on with Oasis? Their first two cds were solid, rock and roll cornerstones. Then, with each of the past three albums, they sound like they have slowly deteriorated into unmemorable haze. &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;, for me, in my opinion, lacks any memorable hooks or songs. The musicianship is solid, but there's nothing that grabs you. Is the band soul searching for their own sound? Were they bored? This is an average recording from the band guys. I mean do I have to debate whether or not &quot;What's The Story Morning Glory&quot; is the band's best recording? &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; isn't even close, and it doesn't offer something different. Like old and new U2, they offered good songs either way, but Oasis seems to have fallen by the wayside. Buy this with caution.
B0000039LE|5.0|this is the horror movie that set it all. after this one a couple of sequals to help and the release of friday the 13th, all the 80's horror flicks tried to take on the impact of the original halloween, halloween is the one that set it all yes the classic texas chainsaw massacre did come out some 4 years earlier but no horrow films were released of the slasher kind the only horror movies that were released were inspired and took on The Exorcist. the 70's was the demon and evil era the 80's was the slasher era the early 90's was the drama era and the late 90's starting with 1996 started the slasher flick and sci fi era again thanks to the release of Scream for the slashers. when halloween came out it was the most successful independent film making more than 50 million at the box office and has stayed the most successful independent film till 1999 when the blair witch project came out and took halloween's place. Halloween- the original slasher flick
B00005LB9O|4.0|Mellow, meandering and thoroughly listenable.  I found myself humming these tunes long after listening, even beyond &quot;Sing,&quot;  the first single from this record.   Highly recommended!
6305171769|5.0|this sequal lives up to the original like a sequal should absolutely a lot better than the other ones and is if not the second best then the third best
B00005JLDW|5.0|I just saw this film today and it kicks butt!  The Male dragon is pretty nasty!  I would say if anyone out there like dragons and Midevil stuff even though the film takes place in past and present day England I'd say go see it!  I smell a sequel coming in the future.  I hope.
B0000640VO|5.0|It is amazing what one person can accomplish when they really put their mind to it. I'm not talking about huge global changes here. Most of us will never be in a position where we can significantly impact a huge number of people in a positive way. This film shows that you really don't have to. Anyone who simply decides to make the lives around them better can succeed a lot more than they fail. Background, education and station have nothing to do with making that little decision and taking action on it.<br />Amelie is a simple girl, with simple tastes. Some one who would just as soon spend an evening skipping stones as going to a fancy restaurant with a man. She is not looking for love so much as direction. Up to the point where the story really begins, Amelie has been simply drifting, as most of us do. Victim of the events that her life has thrown at her. She has a job, an apartment and friends... Maybe not friends so much as aquaintences. The people she lives around and those she works with become her project. Amelie becomes a doer of good deeds.<br />The story plays out sweetly and with very inventive visuals. I'm sure we've all seen the trailers with the pig-lamp that turns itself off and the scene where Amelie disintegrates into a puddle of water after talking with a man she fancies. These effects are not distracting and really do lend themselves well to the progression of the story. Comparissons to Alley MacBeal are inevitable, but mostly inaccurate. Where the illusions on Alley's show were often violent or overtly sexual, those in Amelie are sweet and fanciful. The illustrate the nature of the young woman who has made it her goal in life to make those around her a little happier.<br />The disk itself is loaded with supplements that will allow the viewer to enjoy the film on another level. This is a must have for anyone's collection. Buy it and watch it with some one you love.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe's performance here was phenomenal (much better than his performance in Gladiator, because this was a much more difficult role to play).    A Beautiful Mind is based on the life of John Nash, a brilliant man who, at length, outsmarts his psychological illness.     Describing this movie is difficult without giving anything away... Beautiful Mind takes the viewer on a journey, and just when you are sure you know where you are going, you discover that you had never really left in the first place.     A most amazing movie with twists and turns that rival The Firm and Sixth Sense. Best picture of the year.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay's debut album is a fantastic one. It combines all the emotions in the spectrum to make a near perfect album. Anyone who appreciates music from the heart and soul must buy PARACHUTES. If you don't, you are depriving yourself of a beautiful album.<br />For me to buy a CD is a rarity. I purchased this CD because of the song Yellow which I found gorgeous. I had the notion that the album would have the one good song and that the rest of the tracks would be merely fillers. I was as wrong as I could ever be. Each song is superbly done and invokes emotions from happiness to sadness. Few artists accomplish this feat. I am eagerly anticipating Chris Martin and his great group's sophomore album.<br />If you don't enjoy slow songs, songs with meaning, or 'mood pieces' this superb album is not for you. However, if you enjoy a rare and soulful treat then you must have this album. If you like Dave Matthews, John Mayer, or Pete Yorn, you will love this album. Even if you are not a fan of the above artists, buy this album. You won't regret it!
0061053147|5.0|There can be no better introduction to Blade Runner.<BR>There is a wealth of material here available nowhere else - from interviews with Philip K Dick to anecdotes about the shooting of the film. <BR>My favourite chapters were the ones dealing with the writing of the screenplay; and the one dealing with the rediscovery and release of the Workprint, and the subsequent Director's Cut. You cannot find this information anywhere else.<br />Mr Sammon's writing is somewhat overenthusiastic, reading like a fan's website. But the sheer quanitity and interesting nasture of the material makes up for this.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I don't listen to much Matthews, and the comparison never even came into my mind. Tell the truth, the first time I heard No Such Thing it reminded me of Steely Dan. Less cynical and self-referential, perhaps, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.<BR>   I found this an enjoyable, pleasant group of songs, and I appreciate it for what it is.  My only criticism - the acoustic guitar seems inappropriate for some of the songs; a bit of a muddy sound where crispness is desired.
B000002AZX|5.0|In this album Leonard Cohen displays the full range of his genius.<br /><br />It begins with the richly melodic `Dance Me To The End Of Love', with it's distinct Mediterranean/Israeli style, which remind me of hot romantic summer nights, by the sea.<br />It also includes such magnificent works as the passionate and intense love ballad, `Coming Back To You' and the fascinating mix of romantic and satirical `Night Comes On', the biting satire of `The Captain' and `Heart With No Companion' which embodies a heartfelt and deep explanation of the terrible experience of loneliness and isolation.<br />The greatest track on this album however, is the majestic and spiritual `Hallelujah':<br /><br />\\"They say there was a sacred chord<br />That David played and it pleased the Lord<br />But you don't really care for music, do you?<br />It went like this, the fourth, the fifth<br />the minor fall and the major lift<br />The baffled king composing Hallelujah\\"<br /><br />I also love Jennifer Warnes' rich, melodic, sensual voice, which particularly adds beauty to `Dance Me to The End of Love' and `Hallelujah'.
B000067CPX|4.0|I like this cd. The music is really good. But the only thing that would make this cd better is lyrics that make sese. I mean what the heck does &quot;I'm a rainbow in your jail cell all the memories of everything you've ever smelled&quot; mean? On the other hand I like how the Chili Peppers are sort of branching out...<br />This is a good cd. buy it eventhough the lyrics are weird.
B000067CPX|5.0|What more can I say!?!   Heaps... <br />The first time I listened to this album, I didn't feel the need to skip even one track.  The more I listen to it the more I love it.  <br />In my opinion it is by far their best album.  \\"By the Way\\" is of course a classic track. The song that stands out most to me on this album is \\"Dosed\\"  This is like nothing I have ever heard before, so sweet so melodic, it brings a tear to my eye each time I listen to it.  His voice totaly blows me away on that track and indeed on every track on the album. \\"I could die for you\\" and \\"tear\\" also stand out.<br />To sum it up, this is like nothing else the Chili's have ever done, yet at the same time it screams Chili Peppers.  If you like all their other work you will love this.  If you have never listened to the Red Hot Chili Peppers before in your life you will still love it.<br />I am going to go listen to it again.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is the first pop music CD I have ever bought.  I'm a 17 year old male, and I listen to Zeppelin, Hendrix, Radiohead, Guns N' Roses and things in that vane, but I am quickly becoming a big fan of Avril Lavigne.  I first heard \\"Complicated\\" when she performed on Jay Leno.  I hadn't a clue who she was, and was in fact going to change the channel when she started performing.  I couldn't do it, though.  I instantly fell in love with her voice.  Her performance was so captivating that I watched it straight through and was left thinking that Avril was a cool chick and that \\"Complicated\\" was a damn good song.  It wasn't until later that I downloaded some of her other songs that I discovered how truly talented she is.  \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", \\"Skater Boy\\",  and \\"Losing Grip\\" just to mention a few are all great songs.  Most pop gets old after awhile, but I have listened to this CD over and over and I can honestly say this isn't something you'll listen to for a couple days and then toss it.  <BR>I have lots of respect for Avril.  Unlike much of today's pop artists, she writes and plays her own music.  Not only that, but she got her record contract when she was 16, which is an amazing accomplishment.  ...<BR>Avril Lavigne is a talented songwriter and has an absolutely beautiful voice.  \\"Let Go\\" is without a doubt going to go platinum (if it hasn't yet), and if you don't buy it you will be missing out.  Avril, you are a beautiful, talented, amazing chick and I hope that you continue putting out such great music in future CD's.
0783225857|5.0|I think this a true classic. The book was very good and the movie was very touching. I used to watch the movie all the time when I was little and I still watch when I can. I liked it so much I named my cats afer Jem and Scout
0767805712|5.0|In the not too distant future, science has perfected the technique to genetically enhance babies before they are even implanted into the mother's womb.<br /><br />Vincent (played by Ethan Hawke) was not genetically enhanced (a \\"god\\" child) and tests conducted immediately after he was born showed him to be riddled with possible medical problems. His younger brother, Anton, was genetically enhanced. While everyone repeatedly told Anton how far he could go, they told Vincent never to expect to go anywhere.<br /><br />In a society that heaps praises and opportunities on the genetically pure, there is a black market where people like Vincent can, for a price, take over the identity of people like Jerome (played by Jude Law), a genetically enhanced man who is now confined to a wheelchair. With his new identity, along with Jerome's blood, skin cells, hair, etc., Vincent is able to pursue his dream of going into outer space. But a murder at the company Vincent works for, in which he accidentally leaves a DNA trace of his real self at the scene, threatens to derail his plans.<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie that has something for everyone. Science Fiction, drama, romance, mystery, and even some action. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman (who plays Irene, Vincent's love interest) and Jude Law all give excellent performances.<br /><br />This vision of the future is creepy, though not beyond what we think it could be like. The storyline is extremely compelling, and the \\"coda\\" in the special feature part of the DVD will give you a lot to think about.<br /><br />\\"Gattaca\\" is worth adding to your collection so that you can watch it over and over again.
B00003CXTG|5.0|In Amazon.com's...\\"spotlight review\\" they have a woman expressing her wish for a documentary. Tora! Tora! Tora! is pretty darn close.  I'm so sick of saying it:  if you want a documentary, watch the history channel.  \\"Not historically accurate\\" is an awful description for this movie and anyone who says that is not seeing the movie for what it is: an extremely good war movie.  Instead of looking as to whether or not the Japanese are telling the kids to get down, look at the rest and frankly more important part of the movie.  This is one of the most poignant films I've ever seen and to dismiss it as historically inaccurate is unjustifiable.  Watch, as the first \\"spotlight reviewer\\" did, the movie over again, and try to think about whether or not it matters that the film was historically accurate.  If the film has any problems at all, that is a minor, if not nonexistent, problem.
B00005ALNK|3.0|Donnie Brasco should have been a great movie. The book was an excellent read. However, the movie did not do it justice, as it changed many parts. Goodfellows did it right- Brasco did it wrong. Disappointing...
B000002UY5|5.0|Opps, did you really pass this one up a while back?  A great CD, bye the band that could've, should've, would've been the Led Zepplin of the 90's and beyond if it wasn't for the lead singer with a drug problem.  Having the privledge of seeing this band live, even then I never realized what a sight I was seeing.  This is the kind of band that you would follow around like Phish or the Dead. A jam band, so many musicians there, with a soulful voice, what a shame. Some of the lyrics on this album will relate to your situation as a human being, and you'll realize that your not alone. \\"When you feel your life ain't worth living you've got to stand up and take a look around you then take a look way up to the sky. And when your deepest thoughts are broken, keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die. And right now I don't want to die.\\" Shannon's death was a testiment of what cocaine and herion can do, but don't let this album go because this band is no longer there.  Also check out what the remaining members did, some of it will suprise you.
0060254920|5.0|The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind..and another<br />So starts one of the most perfect and wonderful illustrated children's books of all time.  Max like many children has been engaged in a bit of mischief and is sent to bed without supper. While in his room he imagines an imaginary place where the \\"beasts\\" are wild and he is ruler. Max learns that this is not the kind of place he wants to live  and even though he has made mischief, he is still loved by his parents.  Both are important lessons for a child.<br />As a preschool teacher, I have read this book countless times to many children and can attest to its appeal.  The children are delighted to roll their eyes, show their claws and roar their roars along with the wild things when the wild rumpus starts.  For new parents this is one book I would say to include in your child's library.  I'm sure that you will read it enough times to memorize it.<br />Maurice Sendak's Where The Wild Things Are was first published in 1963 so stands the test of time having served generations of children.  The story and illustrations are as appealing today as they were nearly 40 years ago.
B000002LIX|4.0|Perry Ferrel, an Icon of modern music. Bye, bye hair bands, there was a new kid in town.  Thank bands like this to the popularity of grunge, and to the new style of music that can get dirty and make you fell on top of the world at the same time.  \\"Three Days\\" is a rock anthem. Forget \\"Been caught Steeling\\", thats the worst song on the album.  This album defined the summer of 91', along with blood sugar sex magic by the rhcp, nevermind by nirvana, ten by pearl jam, badmotorfinger by soundgarden, and dirt by alice in chains. It changed the face of what is cool and led the way to creed and most of the other bands around. I like the music around today just as much, but I was thankful for these kinda bands from elimanating hair band music that didn't appeal to me back then and introducing a new sound. Additionally Perry gave us Lollapolza, the new begining of festival concerts that let everybody get a chance to listen to new sounds, ie..Woodstock 94 & 99, Lilith Fair, HORDE festival, Ozz fest, Family Value, Rolling Rock, ect....P.S. if you like this stuff, I should recommend two movies....\\"The Gift\\" by Perry and \\"Funky Monks\\" by RHCP.
B000062XGJ|5.0|Though I had previously viewed the &quot;Predator&quot; VHS edition, the DVD topples it by far.  Not in the area of the feature itself, but the picture and sound quality.  The picture was enhanced so good that it actually looked new and not as if it was from 14 years ago (which is, sadly, the quality of the VHS).  The sound, oh, the sound was very good, really sharp and clear, like most DVD's are supposed to be, but this one was done better than all of the others.  The plot is, Dutch Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a C.I.A. special agent, and his men are sent into some rainforest to rescue a couple of comrades from guerilla hands.  Unknown to them, a creature is stalking them, killing them one at a time for sport and pleasure.  When it all comes down to Schaefer vs. the Predator, the ultimate showdown begins!  Featuring Sonny Landham, Bill Duke, Carl Weathers, and Jesse Ventura as Blaine.  1987/Color/Approx. 107 min./R - for strong action violence, language, and gore.

B00005MP58|5.0|So exclaims very eligible Mr. Bingley at the Assembly Ball when he beholds Miss Jane Bennet in particular. And so Mrs. Bennet's plan to marry off one of her five daughters to a rich man looks like it is well underway. This A&E adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is quite simply the best of its kind ever made. Casting, costuming, sets, screenplay--everything combines excellently to flesh out the novel over a leisurely six hours. <br />The supreme achievement of the work is that so many people watch it repeatedly in its entirety at one sitting--they just can't pull themselves away from the screen. Is this because of sex, nudity, murder, violence, or mystery? No, not at all. There isn't a hint of such things in the whole story. What holds our interest is the care put into the production. Our story is a quiet one, really, compared with much that is written today. As was typical in regency England, Mr. Bennet's estate is entailed; that is, on his death it cannot be inherited by his widow or daughters. It must go to the nearest male heir. And, since he and his wife never produced a son, that means it must go out of the family to a distant cousin, and the women would all be put out on the street if he so desired. Understandably, Mrs. Bennet is dismayed by this prospect, and turns her ambition towards marrying off as many of her daughters as possible to wealthy men, with the unspoken understanding that that will someday provide her with a refuge when her husband dies. The trouble is, wealthy men usually want wealthy wives, and the Bennet girls have no dowries. However, Jane has looks and Elizabeth--the heroine--has intelligence and wit, and on that slender hope rests everything else.            <br />Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth gives a highly effective performance, playing a character with many moods and who goes through more than one epiphany as our story progresses. She forms an early prejudice against the proud, wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, played by Colin Firth. He, too, must learn to change his ideas about things if he is to be happy and get his heart's desire. Firth's performance is more understated than Ehle's, but just as good. Together, their unlikely chemistry fuels the miniseries. All the other supporting characters are excellent as well, with the sole exception of the actress playing Mrs. Bennet; the character is supposed to be a nonsensical person, but this goes beyond that into cariacature, coming too far out of the fabric of the piece. Notwithstanding that, however, the rest of the ensemble pull it off handily.<br />If you've never read Jane Austen's satiric masterpiece, you will surely want to after having seen this movie. And if you have read it, you won't rest until going through it again to relive your favorite scenes now brought to life so beautifully. I give it my highest possible recommendation.
0446677450|2.0|Vague, general, rambling.  There are a few solid nuggets of advice, but they are far between.  This book is little more than a pep talk for absolute beginners.  If you're older than about 22, or if you have any experience at all in business or investing, this book probably is not for you.
0060090367|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time!  This was my first Marian Keyes' experience, and I am definitely looking forward to reading the rest of her books.  Keyes' writing style is wonderful...this book will touch all your emotions.<br />The main character, Claire, is very likeable...I felt like she was a close friend.  We can all relate to her in someway, and also look up to her determination to move on her with life after her husband leaves her and their newborn daughter.<br />I highly recommend this book...you will not be able to put it down!
B00005QDW1|3.0|This isn't a bad CD, it just doesn't live up to the singles or the last effort.  Gwen Stefani said they were out to make a CD they could dance to.  They did, that much is true.  But I do not find this CD making it's way into my CD player often.  I enjoy the singles as they are heavily played on the radio but I have little need to listen to the rest.  I would take either of their last two CDs over this one.  But if you are a die-hard No Doubt fan, don't let this review stop you.  Gwen is definitely captivating in everything she does.
0800132009|5.0|Again, in brief;<BR>Good carton box; Clarity of tape with bright colors. Crystal-clear sound. Good enough.
B00003CX5P|4.0|... not worth the hoopla.  This was, at face value, an entertaining film.  I enjoyed it although I was not mesmerized or bowled over by it.  However, I do believe that George Lucas has essentially lost his mystical touch.  You just cannot recapture the magic of the originals.  Although it should be noted that I have never been a huge Star Wars fan.  My husband is and even he was a little disappointed.  He and all the other die-hards hated Jar Jar Binks.  I, personally, found him to be great comic relief and a cleverly done character.  But it was Liam Neeson who was definitely the stand-out of the film.  I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.  As for the others ... typical Star Wars fare I suppose.  The fanfare over Darth Maul, however, was completely unjustified as he has a very small part in this movie.  This movie is worth seeing and if you're a die-hard trilogy fan, definitely worth owning simply because it's against the code of the Star Wars buffs not to. As for the rest of us ... rent it before you decide to buy it.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Chili Peppers have lived up to the expectations of there previous album Californication.  Not only was that CD amazing, but By The Way shows the depth and evolution of the Chili Peppers music.  They have come from a California Punk band into something entirely new.  When you think that there music can't get any better it does.  By the way is the perfect follow up to Californication.  The music is a depth that is fantastic.  I suggest you go and pick this CD up.
B00005JCA9|5.0|This is one of the relatively few \\"romantic comedies\\" that lives up to both ends of the deal.  Usually you get far more of one than the other.  This movie strikes an excellent balance.  I saw Notting Hill in the theater twice, which is highly unusual for me.  The first time was with a girlfriend and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  So much so that I dragged my husband along the second time.  He even had to admit that he really liked it.  Hugh Grant is so charming in this movie.  And Julia Roberts is very believable and likeable in this flick.  It's a twisted modern day fairy tale of sorts and it is extremely well done.  Every bit of the cast is fantastic although Hugh and his roommate steal the show in terms of comedy.  The soundtrack is immensely fitting and also worth the purchase.  If you liked anything that either Julia or Hugh have done, you will love this one!
B00006690G|4.0|I think this cd was good in some ways. It seems in this cd, Eminem has lost his touch for his musical talent. He has a few good songs like, I'm a soldier, White America, and Till I collapse. But it just doesn't seem to have the beat and style of his first 2 albums. But I still recomend this album to Eminem fans. But buy the other 2 first if you are going to hear from him the first time.
B0000640VN|5.0|I found myself saying that a lot.  This movie is charming and sweet and just all-round aawwwwwwww-inspiring.  If you saw the previews, the movie is exactly what you would expect.  Well, maybe not exactly.  There is somewhat of a twist, but the highly romantic theme was well conveyed in the previews.  Besides being a relatively typical Ryan romance, this movie was very hot in a subtle, sweet way.  If you're a male, that's probably because Meg Ryan is in it.  And if you're a female, it's definitely because Hugh Jackman is in it.  Anyone who doubts Hugh's sex appeal and gentlemanly charm will become a believer with this movie.  Meg Ryan is her usual smart, perky, adorable self.  You'll melt right along with her at Jackman's charm.  The dialogue in this movie is fantastic, particularly Jackman's parts -- well delivered I might add.  I highly recommend this captivating film.  The movie is light-hearted but will leave you thinking at the end.
B0000057C5|5.0|This cd is the best cd i have ever heard. I asked this one guy for some German heavy metal in Sam Goody. I was amazed! This is true heavy metal at it's best! Buy this cd, it is way better than any other bands you have heard, trust me. All of my friends like these guys.
B0000648WZ|5.0|I really do love this movie.  I think Starship Troopers is a great action packed movie.  I thought the movie had an interesting idea instead of blowing up a major city such as London or New York, they picked Buenos Aires. The storyline was interesting it was about a bug race trying to eliminate us. This movie released in 1997 grossed 54 million dollars and it cost 95 million to make.  This is a violent film and has sexuality in it.  It is not recommended for children.  The DVD is good but it should be a lot better.
B00005A46T|1.0|This cd is even worse than the last one they came out with. These guys have no musical talent at all. It all sounds the same, boring and annoying! Dont get this cd, I dont see how these guys could have fans.
B00000K2UX|5.0|This is a great soundrack to a phenominal successful film Top Gun.  It features the hits &quot;Danger Zone&quot; and the number one hit &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; by Berlin.  This newly released album featuring five extra tracks is well worth it.  Originally released in 1986 this album sold 9 million copies and is much better than Dirty Dancing Soundtrack.  I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who likes '80s movies or songs.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I got this cd from one of my friends and i have to say they are really boring and annoying at the same time. They scream and the beat is always off tune and you dont know what they are saying. This band has no talent and I don't see how people can like them. I recomend something like, Rammstein.
B000002W9Q|3.0|This is an okay soundtrack featuring some old songs and new ones such as &quot;I've Had The Time of My Life&quot;.  The problem with this soundtrack is the sound quality, I can bearly hear it on my CD player i have to pump it up on the highest notch to enjoy the full sound.  The other problem i have with this soundtrack is I don't want to listen to every song so I find myself skipping certain songs.  This is an okay album that sold 11 million copies! Buy it if you want but I would rather get these songs from other albums with more songs that I like.
068484267X|5.0|I actually couldn't put it down!  Such a heart-breaking memoir, we can feel the sadness and frustrations.  The language was uniquely simple although can be confusing until we understand his style.  Frank and funny, I couldn't help wondering how he could be so matter-of-factly about the sorry state of the childhood.  But that's life.<br />A very good book for the simple pleasure of reading and getting your heart captured.<br />I haven't seen the movie said to be so-so.  But as they say.. don't judge the book by its movie.
0790730960|5.0|This movie is a good creepy kind of movie.  It is very dark.  Michael Keaton returns as Batman.  This was the last good Batman before the series went for the down turn.  It had a good story and it invoveled Three evil characters Cat Woman, Penguin and the Mayor.  This is a good movie to buy and if you're a fan of Batman it is a must and for anyone who likes dark movies this is the one for you. The DVD is bland but I really didn't care i just liked the movie.
1583762027|5.0|I've never written a review, but this book is just increadible. It is like the blueprint of effectiveness. If you'd like to model absolutely effective and focused people but don't have many around you, then get this book. It perfectly reminded me of the habits of all the effective people that I met in my life. And made conscious to me that those people are not born that way but they consistently apply (consciously or unconsciously) the principles Brian discribes. But be careful: The principles described in it sound simple but the trick is in taking them absolutely serious and integrating them in your charakter. It changed the way I work. I'd like to meet Brian someday and tell him what positive influence he had over me. God bless you Brian!
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet, by director David Lynch, is a American classic and disturbing from the very begining to the end. It is about a young man played by Kyle MacLachan (Dune, Twin Peaks) who discovers a human ear in a field. He gets into a dark and mysterious world with a beautiful woman with a terrifying life played by Isabella Roselini and a sadist who breathes nitrogus oxide played amazingly by Dennis Hopper. David Lynch's twisted imagination as seen through Eraserhead, Lost Highway, and most recently Mulholland Drive plays a big part of this film. From the beautiful scenery to haunting underworld, it is David Lynch's unique vision that brings this film to life.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I saw the movie before its Oscar success.  I was dissapointed in the movie then and very dissapointed it won \\"Best Picture\\".  Its not as moving or emotional as I would expect....and the story line dissapointed me.....I actually thought the main character was going to get involved with the government and the cold war, etc. (I obviously did not know the story of Nash prior to my viewing!) thinking it would be an action-drama style movie.  He's insane?  What?  What a rip-off.  If he contributed to the world of math, the movie didn't really develope his contribution...I think I would have enjoyed the movie better if they had explored that more than the insanity stuff.  I was reading Neal Stephenson's most excellent book \\"Cryptonomicon\\" at the time and I thought this movie was in the same line.  Well, I still gave it 3 stars, which is average....definitely not best picture.
B00005B36H|1.0|Remember trhey days when metal was actually quite fun when bands like Iron Maiden, Cradle of Filth and Metalica rulled with songs about...........well it never really matterd you could go to a concert fully aware that you never really needed to care about the lyrics and you just had to bang your head too and there was always a giant skull to be seen.Ah but then nirvana came alng and everything changed these days tool and their like rule their world of metal and without any of the fun that their the old guard possesed you now really do have to think about the lyrics because the music is so unlistanable its a shame because metal should never be like that hopefully another spinal tap will come along and expose this music for the sham it is.
B00004XPP0|4.0|I personaly love the Star Wars films.  The never ones are a bit lame, but i must admit, i am obsessed.  A Star Wars freak.  I kinda grew up on them, seeing them over and over when i was little.  No one can replace Harrison Ford as Han Solo, or Luke Skywalker, and Yoda is much quarkier in the older movies.  Its basic Sci-Fi action that is irreplaceable.  But George Lucas needs to make his newer ones more interesting!
B00005NEUF|1.0|are great for radioplay and a little head bobbing here and there.  BUT to draw any conclusion that these kids have or will ever come close the talents they have so blatantly ripped off -- The Velvets and the Stooges  -- is a travesty.  <br />Go to the real artist for some real music full of imagination and amazing orchestration.
B00006950W|5.0|I have seen every zombie movie there is from Dawn of the Dead to Erotic Nights of the Living Dead. Resident Evil is one of the best that's for sure.Watch it and you'll know what I mean.
B000066I6N|5.0|Robert Anthony Plant continues to rock the house with his latest effort from Hey Joe to Song to the Siren he reminds us of what music is supposed to be. Thematic tracks raw,cutting and energized, always stretching and taking it to another level. Dreamland dares to be different and delivers in a major way. Turn on the radio today and you won't find anything like it, passionate, committed even inspired renditions. Buy it and challenge yourself to sit still. No air guitar, no fist microphones, no dancing, no drumming the steering wheel, just sit there and listen. You can't, but you'll have fun trying.
B000002B30|2.0|Even Springsteen did not like the song selection for the greatest hits cd, that's why his back is turned away to show his shame at Columbia.  8 good songs I see (1-5,7,8,&amp;10) but how could they leave off fan favorites like &quot;Rosalita&quot;, &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;, and &quot;10th Ave. Freeze Out&quot;.  or other good songs &quot;Prove It All Night&quot;, &quot;Promise Land&quot;, &quot;Jungle Land&quot;, &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot;, &quot;She's the One&quot;, &quot;Out in the Street&quot;, &quot;You Can Look (but you better not touch)&quot; and &quot;Cover Me&quot;. To cover all these would probably need 2 disc set, but why not, &quot;The Boss&quot; deserves it, but leave off the solo stuff he's better with  the E Steet Band.
0312265859|1.0|I LOVED the first seven books (rated each one a 5) and couldn't wait for this one.  I was disappointed from the first.  The author used identical plot lines and humor (the stun gun for instance) from previous books.  While I was glad Stephanie finally got together with Ranger, there could have been more details.  The ending was interesting esp when you put some thought to it and does give one thought about how the next one will develop.  However, the rest of the story line needs to be more original - Stephanie needs to grow as a character and bounty hunter, maybe give Grandma a boyfriend (she's still doing the same things at Stiva's as previous books), etc.  ...
B00002ZMNW|5.0|Metallica S&M is simply brilliant!  Just think a metal band playing with a symphony.  It was excellent, the only downside for me was they played too many songs from LOAD and ReLOAD.  The two new songs, No Leaf Clover and - Human, were awesome.  The lighting effects on One were really amazing.  It was great seeing the classic Metallica songs being played with a symphony.  It was very fun and exciting to watch.  I would recommand this to any Metallica fan!  I have the video and it was awesome I can't imagine what it's like on DVD!!  BUY IT!!!  METALLICA RULEZ!!!!
0393317552|5.0|An excellent read.  Well researched, and thought out.  The only weak spot is the explanation of why China fell behind the west.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a captivating thriller that keeps your attention from beginning to end, or should i say end to beginning.  No other movie that I know of employs this technique of telling the story backwards, and it is implemented surprisingly well.  Rather than wondering what happens next in the story, the viewer tries to figure out the cause of what happens, which is equally if not more fascinating.  Guy Pearce plays his character superbly as does his supporting cast.  Besides being a thoroughly satisfying mystery, the film also provides an interesting perspective on some aspects of the human condition, exemplified by the memory-lossed character in Pearce.  Overall just a great movie.
B000000OSE|5.0|Guns n Roses have only gone and produced another fantastic CD that you just have to have!!The comparisons between this and Use your Illusion 2 have been somewhat varied and Im here to tell you the truth.Both albums you have to have in your CD collection, because with both of them you get the whole deal.Neither one, do I feel, is superior to the other, and whoever said Get in The Ring is a bad song, then they need to be institutionilised!It is a great song, just as all of the others including Garden of Eden and The Garden, some people just dont understand music I suppose.Go and buy them both!!
0316666343|5.0|I read about this book in Time magazine and reserved a copy at the library.  Then, I read the Amazon reviews, and bought a copy at the bookstore--at full price--ouch!!  I do not regret my decision.   What a wonderful story!  I especially liked the fact that this is the author's first novel, and I like to support new authors by BUYING their book rather than borrowing it!  This is a story that will touch your heart and soul.  It had special significance for me:  a dear friend of mine in high school was murdered, ironically, about the same time that this story took place.  How touching to think that our departed loved ones are near us, and watching us at all times. I hope that all who read this review will enjoy this book as much as I have!
0930289234|5.0|In my opinion, if you haven't read Wacthmen you're not a fan of comics; because you haven't read what defines the comic book genre. Watchmen is not a story about super heroes, it's a story about very human people. I think that if we did live in a world with superheroes, this would be it. People don't worship them, like they do Superman, they don't trust them like they do the JLA, in fact they don't even like them. It's the most realistic comic book I've ever read, and it gets better every time.<br />Now, some people don't like Watchmen because they feel that it's past it's prime, but that's simply not the case. Watchmen is still a breathtaking read; not becuase of the dialogue, not because of the characters, not even becuase of the story. It's because of the way Alan Moore TELLS the story.<br />In a recent issue of Wizard, Alan Moore stated \\"I'm talking about the stuff that was actually important about Watchmen, which was not the superheroes at all-- it was the way the story was told.\\" That is the best way to describe what makes Watchmen so outstanding. Watchmen is considered by many the greatest comic ever produced, and I suggest whole-heatedly to pick it up, especially through TPB form. If you are looking for a comic with hard hitting action, go buy The Authority. But if you're looking to buy the finest depiction of the superhero lifestyle to ever be portrayed in comics, buy Watchmen; end of story.
B000067CPX|2.0|If you are looking for an album to make you sleep then look no more. I'm sorry I paid full price for this album. Except for the title track there is not much of the RHCP left, if any. The offical reviews i.e. Rolling Stone rate this better than Californication. I would like to know what universe the reviewers are living on because it sure isn't this one.
B00005OAIE|4.0|My orignal review written a few months ago is below. I just had to edit to note that Room For Squares has quickly worn out its welcome with me. I keep looking at it sitting on my console saying \\"why did I buy this?\\" I guess if you arent really a  folky pop fan the appeal wears off quickly. <br />This album doesn't set out to change the world and it doesn't; it simply provides about an hour of very listenable, enjoyable light music. Mr. Mayer has a pleasant voice and he has managed to use acoustic guitar sparingly enough, such that the album never feels too \\"rootsy\\", and never offends one's pop/rock sensibilities. His bass guitarist provides some great energy as well. The lyrics leave much to be desired but alas this if his first effort.<BR>Standout tracks: my stupid mouth, love song for no one, back to you<BR>
0140177396|5.0|...P>The best laid plans of mice and men oft go awry and many times it is due to the uncontrollable longing that nearly everyone has to belong somewhere, to have something we can call our own.  We can say too that our failures may be due to a state of mind or the wish to fill an endlessly yawning hole in the psyche.  Inner loneliness often drives us in our several directions towards fulfillment.  For drifters like George and Candy, it's a little piece of land that beckons; for Lennie, it's something soft and close---a dead mouse, a puppy, a piece of velvet.  For Curley's wife, that ultimate destination was love, attention, and recognition; for Crooks, respect and justice.  In OF MICE AND MEN, nobody gets what they want.  The novel, like life, is an unmitigated tragedy and we are our own worst enemies.<br />This is an American classic in the real sense of the word.  Though Bob Dylan's verses may not be totally precise in summing up the story, they certainly sum up my mood after putting down OF MICE AND MEN.  \\"Nobody tried to say a word, when they carried him out in jest.  Except of course the little neighbor boy, who carried him to rest.  And he just walked along alone, with his guilt so well concealed.  Muttering underneath his breath, \\"Nothing is revealed.\\"  Amen
B00003CXI1|5.0|What a truly wonderful film! I own the DVD and probably have seen it so many times that I've memorised it but 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is one of those films that you can watch over and over again without ever getting bored with it.<br />THE STORY: Harry Potter is an 11-year-old British boy who was orphaned when he was a baby and taken in by his mean Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and spoiled cousin Dudley. The Dursleys know of Harry's past...Harry is unlike most children because his parents were a witch and wizard, and tried to hide his magical side from him because they are afraid of &quot;abnormal people&quot;. But on his 11th birthday, Harry learns about his wizarding destiny and attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry...where many magical, and some dangerous, adventures await him.<br />THE ACTING: I found the acting by the entire cast to be truly believable and superb. For first timers in a major motion picture, Daniel Radcliffe (&quot;Harry Potter&quot;), Rupert Grint (&quot;Ron Weasley&quot;), Emma Watson (&quot;Hermione Granger&quot;), and Tom Felton (&quot;Draco Malfoy&quot;), were perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better casting for the roles of the kids! The supporting kid cast was also excellent, such as the two twin boys who played Fred and George Weasley, and the boys who played Neville Longbottom, Oliver Wood, and Percy Weasley. <br />Then there was the adult cast...BEYOND PERFECT! I just love Maggie Smith and she was so amazing as Professor McGonagall! Richard Harris was an awesome Professor Dumbledore though I have to say that if he had read the books, then he probably could've improved his character. Alan Rickman was so creepy as Professor Snape, Harry's least favorite teacher and the Potions master. Robbie Coltrane was fabulous as Hagrid, the half-giant and Hogwarts Games Keeper who Harry befriends. Though I must say that he used too much proper English and there were times when he wasn't following Hagrid's language very well. And Julie Walters, who plays a bigger role in the later movies, was simply great as Mrs. Weasley, Ron's mother.<br />THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: Simply spectacular! the Hogwarts castle looked so enchanting and real...just as I imagined it to look. The computerized generated effects were astonishing and fit in very well to the real background scenary. It all looked just as I thought it would...magical.<br />THE TIME-LENGTH: About two and a half hours long (152 minutes)...wouldn't have minded if it had been longer, then they probably could've fit more of the book in it.<br />FAITHFUL OR NOT?: Pretty faithful to the novel, which I read right before I first saw the film in theaters. They left out a lot of the beginning before Harry goes to Hogwarts and at the end when he leaves to go back to Private Drive where the Durlseys live...but all in all, pretty much faithful to the book. I hope the other movies continue to stay even more truthful to their books.<br />THE DVD: Okay...but definitely could've been MUCH better. What was extremely disappointing with the 7 deleted scenes was the fact that there were no director's commentary included with them. The interviews were actually the best part of disc 2...because the director, Chris Columbus, the producer, and the screenwriter gave insights on the making of 'Sorcerer's Stone' and you got to see glimps of what went on behind-the-scenes and a short insight of what 'Chamber of Secrets' will be like. The game is easy once you get the directions on how to get through it to get to the deleted scenes (if you're having trouble, the directions can be found on the official Harry Potter website), but it should be an option for those who do not want to play a game everytime they want to see the deleted scenes. More special features were probably needed (they had all those TV specials on the movie before it came out and could've added those onto the DVD). The picture and sound quality are top-notch, though.<br />All in all, if you loved the movie enough, then you should definitely purchase the DVD. I hope they make a collector's edition later with all of the REAL special features. If you're not crazy about the deleted scenes or the interview, then purchase the VHS. <br />'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a must have for your family movie library! I can't wait for the next installment, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'!
B00005R87Q|1.0|it disturbs me to see how many people actually rated this movie highly. the acting [was terrible], the plot was a rip-off, and all the cars looked like cheap, brightly painted wind-up toys. plus, they cheated by using some chemical with a stupid name in their cars, so you can't even call what was going on in this movie \\"racing.\\" after thirty minutes of hearing the main character's bad imitation of keanu reeves, i wanted to punch the guy in the face. watch \\"point break\\" instead. watch anything instead.
0805047905|5.0|Just bought this book--it's very cute and the kids (1 1/2 and 2 1/2) like guessing what animal is \\"next\\".  It's short, so it works even for the youngest kids and the art is really neat.  We stop on pages to say the animal sounds that match the pictures.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I have not gotten tired of listening to my LOTR soundtrack even after having it for 6 months. I hope that Peter Jackson comes out with a soundtrack that has every little piece of LOTR: FOTR music from the movie.
0694013013|5.0|Though I don't recommend it for bed time, this book is great fun for the kids to do the things asked of them in the book.  They move their heads, kick feet, etc. My kids really enjoy it.
B000067JHW|5.0|Amelie is a perfect little movie.  I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love.  Creative filmmaking, gorgeous use of color, and artistic visual style &amp; composition.   The story, and adorable Amelie, are totally captivating, sweet, sad, quirky, and lovable.  It sounds like fluff, but it's not, it has a lot of genuine feeling and substance.  Like a movie critic said: &quot;It deserves to be cherished, hugged and celebrated.&quot; ... Delightful film making... &quot;with a cherry on top.&quot;
B0000646UN|5.0|Indeed! When the Soviet juggernaut attacked tiny Finland, democracy itself was under attack. And the United States and Britain stood by and pledged \\"moral support\\"! Shame, shame on us and all the reason to obtain this little known film and watch it with our heads hung low. <br />Just a correction though. Finnish males between the ages of 17 and 25 are required to serve 6-11 months. Nobody is actually required to keep guns and the gun control laws in Finland are relatively strict. But if guns were ever needed in the hands of law-abiding citizens, that was the time.<br />See this movie!
B00003CXIP|5.0|I can't say enough wonderful things about Stand By Me. It's superbly acted by everyone and has so much more meaning than just another &quot;kids&quot; flick. The Goonies this is not, it says so much in such a short time. It's FUNNY as hell sometimes and deeply moving other times. Wil Wheaton is great as Gordy, the sad doy eyed kid with a father who is about as sensitive as a brick wall and an imagination that could sell about as many stories as Stephen King. River Phoenix was stupendous as always, showing warmth and charm and such great talent. Corey was funny and disturbing, classic Feldman acting. Jerry O'Connell was priceless as the lovable Vern-o! &quot;I brought the comb!&quot; Plus we get the devishly wonderful Keifer Sutherland as the bully from hell. How could someone so hot be such an a-hole in every 80s movie?! But I love that guy, he adds the flavor to this movie. As an even added bonus we get two scenes with the always favorite John Cusask, as Gordy's deceased brother Denny. This movie has it all and I never tire of watching it. The DVD was quite awesome! I was pleasantly surprised with the wonderful features, including the really cool behind the scenes featurette, featuring of course the entire cast looking so much older. Listening to their stories was about as entertaning as the film. Great job on the dvd, we even get the Stand By Me video! :)
0812550706|4.0|Card has a firm grasp of human frailty and emotion, as well as military (or space, rather) strategy. Although a sci-fi book, 'Ender's Game' doesn't read or develop like one. A classic outside of any genre.
B000000993|5.0|i am yet to encounter a band better than tool in any way shape or form. I first bought Opiate, tools first cd, i loved it, it had to do with religious mumbo-jumbo. Tool is no pongo pygmaeus when it comes to handling instruments, it seems as if the band members are hocked-up on something, which they most likely are, but who cares? After listening to tool's undertow and opiate combined i burned my scapular and replaced it with a flaming third eye. Perhaps you have no idea what im saying hardly do i at times, but let me say that tool is better than any other band ever and if you do not buy at least one cd you are truly missing out, for those who do not like and speak badly of tool kiss the brown eye and drown...please
6304510861|5.0|Of all David Lynch's movies I have seen yet (Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet and this one), this was actually the most I was eagerly to watch (although I'm quite interested in his new apparent masterpiece &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;), since I am a huge Nine Inch Nails fans and always wanted to know why Trent Reznor produced the soundtrack. That was dued to the fact that he also produced Oliver Stone's 1994 underrated Natural Born Killers, which was a memorable soundtrack for a great movie. So I was in expectations this one could be a second part.<br />And it was.The movie is completely confusing, but doesn't lose its qualities then: it's strangely mind-blowing. Bill Pulman and Patricia Arquette do a good job here as a couple, but surely the oscar goes to Balthazar Getty, who plays Bill Pulman &quot;alter-ego&quot;.<BR>The movie's most intriguing hour, which Fred turns to Pete, is obviously a mention to psychogenic fugue, which is allowing yourself to changing identity to somebody else, believe you are somebody else. But the fuzz doesn't stop here: many things are complicated to understand, if possible to.<br />All in all, this movie deserves a 5 star in Spielberg's face, since it shows that it isn't necessary to have a high budget and good reviews to define a good movie.
0060934913|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is presumably a very good cook (I've never eaten at any of his restaurants, so I don't know). However, I know that he is a very good writer. 'Kitchen Confidential' is an incredibly entertaining look into the restaurant industry. I think that anyone who likes to dine out, would find this book fascinating. After reading this book, you will appreciate the effort it takes to put a good meal in front of a diner. It also provides an insight into the behind-the-scenes people who do all the work to produce the eventual dish that is served to your table.
B000060P79|5.0|This cd is simply awesome! I just bought it today and I have already listened to it several times. I just can't get enough!!! After seeing them at the Pop Disaster tour in Indy, I just had to get the cd and it was totally worth it. You won't regret buying it. If you like punk-popish music (who doesn't).. get this cd!!!

B00005B4GU|5.0|Let me tell you something, I am a hardcore fan of Radiohead and although I do appreciate Radiohead's older Albums I definitely think Amnesiac ranks with some of the best music of our time. Pablo Honey (Radioheads first album) was highly commercial(although also excellent) and afte that Thom Yorke grew and if people didnt want to grow with him they can go listen to N'Sync. During the Kid-A times Radioheads music changed very drasticly. Amnesiac was the perfect mix of everything. It even uses clasical techniques like in Pyramid Song with soft piano. Although there is a lot less guitar on Amnesiac ( compared to the bends and pablo honey) Such songs as Knives out have great licks of guitar that resemble there Pink Floydesk Style.. Purchas this album as soon as you can. You can't file this album under any genre all you can classify it is as music. Ofcourse Id love to stay and chat ofcourse id like to stick around and chew the fat.. BUY THIS CD
B00005N9CV|3.0|I could play 'S'Wonderful' and 'The Look of Love' all day, but the rest of the album... not really. If Diana Krall jammed like she does in those two songs in all her songs, I'd listen to them constantly, but as it is, there's only a couple that beg repeating. Another reviewer mentioned that she's &quot;souled-out&quot;. Give her room to showcase her voice and she'll be good to go- girlfriend needs to sing it like she means it, not like how she's supposed to. When she doesn't do vocal stylistics, the magic isn't happening, so please! more of that.
0385720920|5.0|Ok, so granted this is isn't as great as Survivor or Invisble Monsters but it's still a good novel. At some points I felt that it was dragging a bit and that it was getting boring, and that rarely happens in Chuck books. And the whole sex part of the plot was just really kind of unnecessary when you think about it. But I still give it a 5 star because it was very entertaining and the climax is hilarious.
B000068PQ0|5.0|There are not to many bands that can keep outdoing themselves like The Flaming Lips.  After releasing the masterpiece that is the Soft Bulletin, they follow it up with an album that is just as good.  There are not alot of bands that can keep outdoing themselves these days.  This will rank among the best of the year without a question.
0393317552|5.0|There is a difference between \\"READING a book\\" and \\"reading a book.\\"  If you \\"READ\\" a book, you think about it and get into it.  If you \\"read\\" a book (as most of the 1 star reviewers OBVIOUSLY did) you lemming along through it without putting thought into it.  If all you do is \\"read\\" a book, save your money.  If you \\"READ\\" books...SPEND IT HERE!!!<br />Does Diamond provide LOTS of data about geograpy, agriculture, etc.?  Yes, he does.  He creates a book and theory that is based on SCIENTIFIC FACT.  We need SO MUCH MORE of this in society, & I'm glad Diamond has done it.<br />Here are the basic questions that Diamond addresses...LOTS of data suggest that humans were in Africa LONG before Europe, Asia, America, etc.  The technology of farming and animal domestication began there THOUSANDS of years before America, Europe, etc.  So why did Europe rise up and begin to dominate the world?  With such a head start, why didn't Africa take the next step?  Why didn't they develop steel, guns, advanced navigation, etc.  Why are MOST of the names we rattle off (Newton, Einstein, Copernicus, Caesar, etc.) as the most amazing people in history of some type of European origin?  Why didn't the Mayans, Incas, Aztecs, or Aboriginies take the steps that Europe took?  What happenend?  Why did they stop?<br />Again, VERY interesting book actually based on science that provides a logical answer to some of these questions, and like ANY good scientist, Diamond admits, IMMEDIATELY, that there is NO definite answer to this question, but this is what the data suggest.<br />Highly recommed this if you are ready to think about why the world is the way it is.  Forget the obvious things you know.  ANY army with guns will eventually beat ANY army that only has clubs...forget that, but try to think about WHY did Spain have guns & the Incas didn't.  What kept them from taking that step.  So, READ this book, think about it, and excerise your ability to make logical connections.
0316666343|5.0|Yes, The Lovely Bones is sad. Yes, The Lovely Bones wraps up in a too neat bow. Yes, The Lovely Bones is a jewel...a treat...a rarity. A book that makes you sad but also gives you hope for your own life and the lives of our loved ones. You can savor this one for a long time. I look forward to re-reading it some time when i need a dose of hope. My hat is off to Alice Sebold.
B000005J56|4.0|Highly recommended!  The music is exciting.
B000063V8R|5.0|What can I say - it just gets better and better. I'm so happy they finally have come out on DVD. Can't wait for the other seasons! Great format on the DVDs - includes little known info on some about the making of certain episodes and quirky things about some of the crew. Nice touch!
B00000DQWT|4.0|ummm, I hope sutherland's review was written before 1999, when Metheny did the soundtrack for &quot;A Map of the World.&quot;
B000007VCM|5.0|it is simply one of the greatest album made, every track is just fantastically produced and played. I first heard of the cult with the SSS song, i had like 5 different versions of the long play on that song alone, but the album's cuts are even better, Nirvana is one of my fav tracks..on a second thought, they are all my favorites...get this album and see why the music nowadays pales in comparison!
0441009425|5.0|This was an excellent read in every respect.
B000002GJH|5.0|This is a timeless album, and benefits enormously from the fact that, with the exception of \\"Hunger Strike,\\" it got almost no radio play.  If you like Pearl Jam and/or Soundgarden, you will love this album.  It is humbler than the former band, and more humane than the latter.  It manages to be both fun and moving, and has stood up to my and my friends' repeated listenings over the past decade.
0887306128|4.0|Although Drucker wrote EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE more than 30 years ago, the principles of decision making are still relevant today, if not more so.  The effective executive. . . <br />1) Knows where their time goes.  Time is the most valuable resource and is inelastic.  It must be managed.  What has priority?  What is better left undone?  What can be outsourced? <br />2) Focuses on results (not effort) by asking: <BR>\\"What do I do that justifies my being on the payroll?\\" (pg 53).  <br />3) Staff to people's strength (not the absence of weakness).  <BR>There is no such thing as a \\"good man\\".  Good at what?  Likewise, a person is hired to produce results, not to please a superior, or blend in.  <br />4) Fills the job with the right person (not fits the job to the available person).  Jobs in the organization are interdependent; if one changes, it will affect another.  Also, \\"To tolerate diversity, relationships must be task-focused rather than personality focused.\\" (pg 77)<br />5) Tries to be himself / herself (not someone else). (S)He looks for patterns in their performance, and focus on their strengths.  \\"Feed the opportunities and starve the problems.\\" (pg 98)  <br />6) Concentrates on one effort at a time. (not multi-tasking)<BR>It is hard enough to do one thing right.  <br />7) Concentrates on important and strategic decisions (not a great number of small, reactionary decisions).  Many problems were created in the past, and solving them only re-establishes the status quo.  It is better to seek opportunities than just fix problems.<br />8) Makes decisions based on dissenting opinions (not pseudo facts and pre-judgements)  Use other's opinions to form a case for each side.<br />9) Acts or does not act (no hedging or compromise)
0385503954|2.0|this book deals with noble sentiments in a noble way..and i dearly wanted to enjoy it ..much like i want kids to give up their bus seats for old people .<BR>but the mundane war time detail just bored me..the characters bored me especially bryony /mcewan who seem to mistake art for clever rambling sentence structure and forget that a novel and a dairy are different things ..and that sometimes people just want to be entertained ...
0446608955|5.0|this book is just plain great. It was so sweet!! I couldn't beleive that I cried at the end because I saw the movie first(also really really great).So well it's basically about a teen boy whole falls in love with the last person on the planet he figured he would ever fall in love with. By the end of the book he has really changed his view about life and really grows up.
B0000640SA|5.0|--Quick plot synopsis:  A psychological thriller about a man with short-term memory loss trying to track down his wife's killer. It does an excellent view of putting the viewer on the same level as the main character by showing the movie in reverse. ie. The first scene you see is the last one in the story.<br />--The folks at Columbia/Tristar really went all-out to bring the viewer into this movie. The menus alone give you a perspective on the story and main character not possible in the theater. This two-disc set gives you everything you'd expect from a special edition: director's commentary; trailers; production photos; mini documentary; 5.1 surround sound, etc. But wait, there's more... It's just hidden within the maze of questions in the psychological exam that makes up the menus on both discs. If you keep searching on disc two, you'll be able to watch the movie in chronological order, which is my reason for buying this special edition. (If they don't edit this out as a spoiler, just select the Clock form the main menu, choose answer \\"c\\" five times on the questions, then put the pictures of the woman fixing the flat tire in the order of 3,4,1,2.)
B00000K2SC|5.0|I've seen this movie countless times , around 20 or so. I know ever line and sence. If this is your first time to see it watch the special effects the first time but pay close attention the the story line or you could get lost. Don't worry the special effects are reason enough to buy this movie it does have something for ever over the age of 10 or there about.(if aloud to see R). A must buy for anyone and look for the next two \\"the Matrix reloaded and Matrix revolution\\" both come out in 'I think' 2003 or late 2002. GET THEM All!
6305127689|4.0|Hold out for a new special edition of this DVD, which released in the early days of that format.  It's  not anamorphic and not very good  The   movie will be a huge hit again when they give it a special treatment.  Until then,  do yourself a favor and rent, don't buy.
B00005QDW1|5.0|When I first heard \\"Hey Baby\\" on the radio, I was glad to hear that No Doubt was back for a new album.  Like many listeners out there, though, it was only great the first one or two hundred times I heard it on the radio.  But once I heard \\"Hella Good\\" I knew I had to look into buying this CD.  Thanks to Amazon, I was able to listen to snippets of the whole disc before clicking on the \\"add to cart\\" button (thanks Amazon!).  Once I had the full album in hand, I was highly impressed by how No Doubt has grown.  They still very definitely have their ska roots in their music, but now they are experimenting with new sounds- more a combination of ska, reggae, rock, and a little rap mixed in.  <br />Some die-hard No Doubt fans claim that Gwen & Co. are selling out.   I most definitely beg to differ.  Many lesser bands out there only have one claim to fame, and they need to stick to the same formula to keep their fan base listening.  No Doubt, comfortable with the level of fame they have achieved thus far, are not afraid to try out new sounds to evolve as a band.  Their experimentation has paid off.<br />If you're interested in knowing what each track sounds like, click on Amazon's links to the clips- I see no point in describing each song.  But my highlights in addition to Hey Baby and Hella Good are Underneath It All, Running, and Platinum Blond Life.<br />If you truly can't get enough of No Doubt's old sound, listen to Tragic Kingdom some more- it's a great album.  But if you're interested in hearing a new direction from one of today's great bands, give this album a chance.  It's a lot of fun, and none of the songs hits a sour note.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This disc is incredible! John Mayer's songs are sweet, sophisticated, and reveal the insecurities and little moments in life that happen to so many of us as we struggle to grow up. A lot of the songs sound like the self-critical voice we hear in our head when we scrutinize something we did and why, as in My Stupid Mouth. John clearly connects with women in songs like Your Body Is A Wonderland and City Love. The music is beautiful and the words are honest and smart. I can't wait to see more of the world 'through both his eyes', in his next CD. Thanks John!
B0000640VO|5.0|I recently purchased this film from the store on a whim.  I did not know it was a french subtitled film which I absolutely love.  I am glad I purchased this film because I have not felt better after watching a movie as much as I did after this film.  The story is interesting, the movie's filming effects keep your attention fixed, the main character is absolutely adorable and  her life is very interesting.  This film makes you take another look at life, a more positive look at life.  I found myself smiling at the tiniest little details of the movie.  I would reccomend you watch this film, and if you don't buy it before you see it, I guarentee you will afterwards.
B00005QEO2|5.0|This is the best of Steven Tyler &amp; Co. after Joe Perry returned to the group and moving to Geffen. In addition to the hits, there are also tracks that had hit potential but are still considered well-known tracks. There are also a few that were never released in the U.S. for whatever reason. As a bonus, the collaboration with Run-DMC is included here (an '80s rap version of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;). There's also an alternate acoustic version of &quot;Livin' On The Edge&quot;. If you want the best of what they recorded for Geffen Records, you can't beat this.
B000021YQV|5.0|Since RATM broke up System Of A Down has taken their place quite easily.  This being their 2nd alblum I expected it to be worse than their first, was I ever wrong.  This CD has to be one of the most complete out there, I can listen to it from start to finish without skipping tracks because I don't like them.<br />The best tracks on the CD are:<br />1. X<BR>2. Aerials<BR>3. Toxicity<BR>4. ATWA<BR>5. Prison Song<br />If you wanna get away from the normal hard rock and all screaming type of bands, buy this CD.
B00005JLDW|3.0|Over acting, under acting, dialog from hell, corny get-togethers , he man tactics, fire breathing dragons (napalm) already dreary country-sides. Best man wins the girl. And in the end the French are shut-out, an hour late and a franc short. Oh  well you know the french. A totally grade B movie and I liked it , with all the hamming-it-up-american's landed to save what was left of a rag tag society in merry ole England. <BR>Director Rob Boman, who has a lot of great tv plots under his belt, X Files, Dark Shadows,Alien Nation, to name a few, really cuts loose with the fire belching dragons. Mathew McCaughhey,  Fraility, U-571, Time To Kill, Lone Star(Van Zan) American dragon slayer has arrived in force with what is left of the army to kick some dragon-butt. And to direct the english on how to wipe out these dragoons. Christian Bale,(quinn), remember little Jim in Empire Of The Sun, and grown up Jim in American Psycho, Velvet Goldmine, well he is the leader of the English and the first one as a little boy to see the first dragon to come out of hibernation and thus the destruction of humankind. Van Zann has figured out that there is only one male dragon (it lives in London) for all the females, to fertilize their eggs, (rough job) and Van Zann says if we get this male, then the other 15 million female's will come to a screeching halt ( I guess), but anyway don't try and figure it out just sit back and be prepared for a really, really great grade B movie, only 87 min long. I give this flick 2 for bringing back these no brainer's and using some great talent to do it. <BR>ciao yaaah69
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Ever since I bought this soundtrack, it's been in my cd player for at least four days out of the week. It brings beautiful music from the beginning, when Christian and Satine first fall in love, and some from the Show in the end of the film. I was a little disappointed that it, and its sister, Moulin Rouge 2, didn't contain the small song Satine sings when Harold tells her she musn't see Christian anymore (\\"If I should die this very moment..\\"), or the Green Fairy's number, but it's a good soundtrack anyway. Looking forward to Moulin Rouge 3.. they have enough music for it.
B00005JLDW|3.0|The first thing that comes to mind when writing about this film is that it's well, out there!  It's like the Mad Max films with Dragons instead of Motorcycle thugs.  This could have been a horrible film, but thanks to the script and casting, it works.  <br />Christian Bale is most of the glue that holds this would be meess  together.  His level- headed character provides a fine balance to McConoughay's \\"tough as nails\\" American.  And their relationship is a fine example of what's best in both American and Brittish culture, and the good things that happen when they are combined. <br />Rather than engaging in any \\"holier than thou\\" cultural mud slinging, the film shows us great things can happen when the best of two worlds come together.  <br />Furthermore, this is a special effects film where the effects aren't more interesting than the characters, and isn't that refreshing?
B0000041Q3|5.0|except for Dame Joan are the real stars of this recording. Joan Sutherland is one of my all-time top favorite sopranos of all time and space, in this or any other Universe... but she's NOT a Turandot, though the effort here is superb. You won't go wrong with her, but such stars as Nilsson, Marton, and Eva Turner did it far better. I will say one good thing about Joan Sutherland's work here- the sheer tone is beautiful and she does get into the role quite well.<br />Pavarotti turns in a MAGNIFICENT performance as Calaf. My favorite Unknown Prince is Franco Corelli, but Luciano Pavarotti turns in one of those legendary jobs that would alone make his name. Pavarotti's voice soars in this magnificent recording, and that is as it should be. The Liu is the excellent and affecting Montseratte Caballe. If you like Caballe, what are you waiting for? Timur... Nicolai Ghiaurov in his prime! What more can one ask for? Peter Pears as the aged Emperor? Krause as one of the three ministers? They're all perfect for their roles, making the scene where they reminisce about their homes into a gem worth getting the whole opera for just to hear them! The chorus is not quite as feral and elemental as I like them to be for this opera, but the sounds they make! Mehta's leadership here is inspired, as is the orchestral playing. I put the Corelli-Nilsson-Scotto-Giaiotti set slightly ahead of this one, but the sounds brought out here are the most magnificent I've ever heard for Turandot. The live Corelli-Nilsson set on Opera D'Oro is the most magnificent performance available for the two principles, but I would not want to be without this set. All around, I think it deserves to be a classic. The sound, by the way, is excellent! Listen to the others who love it and BUY it already, if you don't have it!

B000067CPX|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are at the peak of their game and on their new album.  I can't say much except that its nothing like what they've ever done and that its saturated with a sound that can only be unique to one band: the Chili Peppers.  In the process of maturing and evolving their sound, they just happened to make the year's best album.  By the Way, its their best work to date.
0425098478|4.0|Reward or punishment! Is this politically correct now-a-days. You bet not, but the idea is worth looking at and thinking about.<br />There are some interesting ideas contained in the very short read. It will provide the beginning manager with a good base to develop their own style, but shouldn't be copied outright. The words &quot;reward&quot; and &quot;punishment&quot; should be re-worked so as not to offend those PC fanatics who cannot deal with older thinking. Also, comparing the trreatment of personnel to that of training a dog, well, it doesn't play well anywhere.<br />I say give this book a read. Find some concepts that you can think about, and see if they can be applied to your present situation. If you spend more than 2 hours reading it, I'd be surprised. Use it as a brainstorming tool, not a How To book.
0800105141|1.0|This movie is one of the biggest examples of how movies in general can slaughter the events that they are based on. This movie was not made as any tribute, so matter what anyone says. This movie was made to MAKE $$$$$$. That's all.
B000068TP0|1.0|THIS REVIEW IS FROM AN EVERYDAY GUY, IF YOU FOLKS OUT THERE EVER SAW ME YOU'D NEVER PEG ME AS A SHAKIRA FAN TYPE..<br />With that said-<BR>Such is the power of Shakira<br />Years from now, Shakira's music and legacy will live on...<br />This DVD is the best introduction into the world of Shakira you'll find. I liked Laundry Service and Even the English and Portuguese remix audio cd'.s But this my friends is HER at her best. The range of musical, emotional and lyrical subtleties of this artist will satiate your appetite just enough and still  keep you coming back for more. This DVD features well thought arrangements perfectly executed for the UNPLUGGED acoustic setting. From one song to the next you'll find yourself immersed.<br />Very high replay value, pop into the DVD player after one of those days and soon you'll have a big grin on your face and forget your troubles.<br />Works for me!
B00004T37H|3.0|After reading all these great reviews about the movie, I decided to give it a go, and I have no idea how it garnered so much praise. It's got vivid colors and generally good animation, but the theme of technology encroaching upon old traditions is nothing new, except this time they had talking pigs and cute little forest spirits, which kind of reminds me of Fern Gully, and in many ways this movie is like a Disney movie. The characters do not develop except in the most cliched of ways: the main character is your typical do-gooder hero type and really doesn't grow throughout the movie, and the villainous village leader realizes the error of her ways after a catastrophic loss...blah blah blah. What's worse is that it seems like the makers couldn't decide whether they wanted to make this a family film or an action anime flick, resulting in some strangely comical action scenes where heads fly in the air but no blood comes out. Despite its shortcomings, I'm giving it three stars because it's fairly entertaining if you are just looking for something fun and simple to watch for 2 hours. If you're looking for anime that'll leave you overwhelmed with emotion, try the Evangelion series instead.
B000005JAX|4.0|This album is reminiscent of the music from Depeche Mode's Music for the Masses.  If you like that album, then you will enjoy this album.  This solo project by Depeche Mode member Martin Gore is like listening to a regular Depeche Mode album except Martin Gore is singing.  This album can easily be added to the Depeche Mode collection considering that the songs performed by Martin are not his own.  It is a short and sweet album to listen to for all you Depeche Mode fans out there and especially if you love Martin's beautiful vocals.
B000002KAT|5.0|this album is the album ever. no other words needed in that sentance. it is the quintessential melancholy walk the streets at night vibe all the way especially in s.f with its haunting mist. also to mention if u are put off by van with his obnoxious way  and the [bad stuff] that he's been putting out the past 20 years dont be, this album is my top on the bottle, above exile, white album, funhouse, on the beach, you get my point. now its up 2 u
B00006690G|5.0|i was never an eminem fan. He disgusted me, and I was often offended by things he said. But then my friend burned me The Eminem Show. It transformed me into a hard-core Eminem fan. He really shows off his raw talent for rhyming, and using his personal experiences as an outlet for his anger. I think he's a genius, and just has an incredible talent for not only saying things that most would dare not say, but also to show that all rappers don't just talk about their money and hoes.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This movie has a combination of everything: Sci-fi, Action, a little bit of humur, and 1 terrifying chest-hugger of horror. I can't forget the first time I watched it. In fact, I consider it a legendary movie of the 20th century. It set a new standard for all new sci-fi movies. Tribute to James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2, Aliens) and H. R. Giger.
0345357116|4.0|This is one of the most underrated of Tolkien's books. It actually contains lots of interesting tales about Middle-earth, including one or two &quot;outtakes&quot; from the Lord of the Rings. A must have for Tolkien's fans!

B000067CPX|5.0|this is an overall awesome cd. when you hear it, it hits you that its the red hot chili peppers but it sounds nothing like you thought it would. its great, alternative, slow, fast, anything can describe it. i recommend it to almost anyone. i for one have never been into the red hot chili peppers until i heard this cd. it is an overwhelming compilation of music that you'll be listening nonstop to for days on end!
B000001ESN|5.0|&quot;...Though glittering prizes and endless compromises, shatters the illusion of integrity, yeah...&quot; Stunning lyrics by Peart, absolutely earth shattering music by Lee and Lifeson, this is what defines 1980's Permanent Waves as the purest rock record that Rush ever recorded. Only Rush could release an album with 6 songs on it that would remain a cornerstone of progressive rock to this day. The tracks are indispensible: The Spirit of Radio, Freewill, Jacob's Ladder, Entre Nous, Different Strings, and Natural Science. No filler, all killer. Spirit of Radio is probably Rush's most recognized song behind Tom Sawyer and contains a harsh condemnation of radio's fall from grace. Freewill is in my top 5 Rush songs ever recorded it just rocks. The heart of Permanent Waves is undoubtedly Natural Science which is a sprawling beast of a song with Neil writing about something he was truly passionate about. Permanent Waves could also be viewed as a prelude to the GREATEST PROGRESSIVE ROCK ALBUM EVER RELEASED, Moving Pictures. Rush was hitting their stride on 2112 and A Farewell to Kings but redefined the genre with Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, and Moving Pictures. This is an absolute must have for any fan of rock music, although I may be a little biased; because to me the liner notes Music by Lee/Lifeson, Lyrics by Peart are better than lyrics by McCartney/Lennon.

B00006AL1G|5.0|I saw the film in the theater in June and I was in awe by the time I left.  It is a well made documentary, that gives a great history and explanation into the world of turntablism.  If your a fan of hip-hop, techno, or any form of music in general, this one is a must buy!
B000001ESJ|5.0|5 Stars but flawed? Yes and the song is Madrigal, an obvious attempt at filler but it has no place on a record with such high standards. Similar to Tears on 2112, Madrigal is slow, quiet, acoustic, and depressing. Nevertheless, ALL of the other tracks on A Farewell to Kings are amazing. The title track is probably Rush's most overlooked song and is followed by one of the greatest Rush songs ever written, Xanadu. Lee's bass playing literally takes over on this track and anchors Farewell. This is the era in which Neil had the handlebar mustache and was wearing robes. But the coolest part about this era was Neil's ability to incorporate almost every facet of percussion known to man including gongs, chimes, wood blocks and any other contraption known to man. His drumset at this point was any drummers wet dream. Closer to the Heart is a concert standard and a great acoustic track. Cinderella Man is another hidden Rush song that only the most ardent fan comes to treasure. And finally, Cygnus X-1, the best song Rush EVER recorded which makes this album a must have for any fan. 1977's A Farewell to Kings finds Rush on the upswing toward prog-rock immortality, one step closer to Hemispheres (the culminating masterpiece of the Rush catalog). Highest Recommendation.

Personally, I have purchased the book for my best friend, my mother, and my mother-in-law.  All have been very taken by it.  It's a great gift idea. If you haven't read it, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.  It's hard to put down, and it gives you a fresh look into life, family and priorities.
0783225903|5.0|Produced in 1985, \\"Brazil\\" is a black (and bleak) comedy about a future gone eerily awry.  A future that, since this is 2002, is already coming true around us.  Terry Gilliam's brilliant, colorfully retro vision of the future has little in common with the styling of Orwell's \\"1984,\\" but deep inside the message is the nearly the same.  The only real difference is that, unlike Orwell, Gilliam believes that the one fragile hope is the durability of the human imagination.<br />The opening scenes of the film reveal a manic world, where a bug (literally) in the works triggers the spectacular arrest of one Archibald Buttle, whose off-screen death under interrogation triggers a flurry of clerical paperwork.  The world we see is fascinating, full of automation nearly gone berserk and the hapless human machinery that fills in the gaps.  In this world, one may not only face hard interrogation, but be billed for that service as well.  When Buttle, mistaken for terrorist Harry Tuttle, suffers a heart attack under questioning, Information Retrieval issues a refund.  However, his wife's lack of a bank account triggers a series of complications.  Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), a daydreaming bureaucrat in the Ministry of Information, takes up the task of resolving the situation by hand delivering the check.<br />Harry faces many delightfully comic situations on his quest, as machinery refuses to function for him and the people in his world seem to treat him as something not quite socially acceptable.  But all of this is brought up sharply when he finally confronts the widow.  \\"My husband's dead, is he,\\" she cries, \\"What have you done with his body?\\"  Suddenly we are confronted with the truth.  The surface is only a surface.  As in \\"The Matrix,\\" once you are past it something horrific looms.  \\"Brazil\\" will continue to play this theme throughout.  Walls conceal semi-organic, hostile masses of tubes and ductwork, room dividers separate upper-class diners from the gory reality of a terrorist bombing.  Masses of plastic surgery cover the flaws of aging beauty.<br />It is no surprise that Harry falls victim to his own daydreams.  Looking up through a hole in Mrs. Buttle's ceiling Lowry spies the face of the woman of his dreams, Jill the truck driver, played wonderfully by Kim Geist.  In his desperate attempts to track her down, Sam transfers into the dark world of Information Retrieval.  There, aided my his friend Jack Lint (Michael Palin), he finds out what he needs, but inadvertently sets in motion a series of events that can only be describes as a burlesque apocalypse.  Layer after layer of his society's illusions collapse around him and Jill with humorous, but nightmarish precision.<br />Terry Gilliam has proven himself a genius at using dark humor and sarcasm to engage in a plot that would be horribly difficult otherwise.  As in \\"The Fisher King,\\" we laugh and snicker right up until we confront the truth.  \\"Brazil\\" is a brilliant example of this.  Full of the imaginative imagery of a retro-future world and great acting by a cast that includes the likes of Robert De Niro and Katherine Helmond it is an experience that stuns the sensibilities while bringing home its message.  In his notes, Gilliam calls this a light-hearted nightmare.  One will haunt you for some time to come.st bombing.

0783235607|5.0|Generally, I really don't like horror/slasher movies. Especially now, these movies are usually guaranteed to be bloody, stupid, not scary, and in the worst possible taste. Psycho, however, is the one exception, and it comes as no surprise that it is the original horror movie (...). I really enjoyed watching Psycho, and boy, was it scary!<br />The reason Psycho is so superior to all other horror films made since, perhaps with a few exceptions, is that all the suspense and terror is created without any truly bloody scenes. Horror films nowadays are guilty of terrible overkill (ironic choice of word) in terms of bloodshed - people are killed left and right, and all the blood and gore is shown. Hitchcock has far too much taste to do anything of the sort: instead, he uses his amazing abilities as a direction to create almost unbearable tension and suspense without actually showing much blood. Psycho is the ultimate illustration of how effective scary movies rely on the atmosphere that is created using music, lighting, etc, etc. - blood is simply not necessary and actually detracts from the suspense factor!<br />Anyhow, all in all, this is a classic film, and it is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. If you are in the mood for a REALLY scary movie, not a stupid slasher film, but a truly frightening and chilling film (that has some interesting psychological stuff thrown in for good measure as well), then get this film, and enjoy being scared!
B00003CXB6|2.0|Before we get to what's wrong with this movie, I thought it would be a nice change to go over the positives first.  Are there any?  I'm not sure.  I think there are.  Oh....right.  Yeah, there's a few.<br />Picture quality is outstanding.<br />Sound quality is very good.<br />Great special effects.<br />Very cool extras.<br />Unfortinatley, that's all that's good with this movie.  The truth is that this movie STINKS!  It's horrible.  It's nothing even near to the original.  In fact, I heard that the book is ten times better than the movie.  I thought the story was terrible.  Acting wasn't that great, either.  And the last half of the movie is like a really bad Godzilla movie.<br />All in all, not a very good movie.  A great DVD, however.  Just a terrible movie.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's pretty close to it.  It's definatley on the list.  The only reason why this movie gets two stars is because of the DVD.  The movie alone should get zero stars.
6300215717|5.0|This movie is one of my all-time favorites, and always leaves me in a good mood. It features two wonderful classic actors, Gregory Peck (though Cary Grant would have been better in the role - he was offered it first but turned it down) and Audrey Hepburn (in her first starring role, which won her an Oscar). Additionally, it is a wonderfully romantic, sweet story, with a good script and many funny moments!<br />Essentially, Roman Holiday is about a young Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) who gets tired of her sheltered life as a princess and decides to run away and explore the world for herself. She leaves the palace and stumbles along until falling asleep on a park bench in Rome, where she is found by a cynical newspaper reporter (Gregory Peck) who reluctantly takes her home. As soon as he realizes who she is, however, he decides to take her around Rome and use his experience with her to write a tell all article on the princess and her life. Accompanied by a hilarious photographer, they go on a tour of Rome - creating many hilarious and romantic scenes along the way!<br />All in all, this movie is really wonderful, and is perfect for the whole family to watch. If you have not already seen this, what are you waiting for?

6300215741|5.0|Although not one of Hitchcock's best films, To Catch is Thief is still a very entertaining comedy/thriller. I really enjoyed watching it (and have actually seen it several times).

B00005JKTF|5.0|I LOVED this movie. From the second it started, with its gorgeous shots of French lilacs or lavender or whatever beautiful purple flower they are, & its sublime musical score by Stephen Warbeck, I was hooked. Cate Blanchett is always dependably good, but she really shines here. Her role is that rare thing- a woman who is not a doormat, a girlfriend, a hooker, or a nun, and she never gets naked. How refreshing! Plus, it's directed by a woman- too cool! I found the love story between the characters of Charlotte Gray & Peter Gregory very believable & terribly romantic, and, as it should, it drives the film to its logical conclusion- a heartbreaking one. Indeed several scenes in this film made my eyes well up with tears. I also appreciated how Charlotte's experiences with loss weren't just glossed over, as in most movies I've seen where someone loses a loved one and by the next scene they're back to normal. Ms. Blanchett is to be commended for bringing that bit of true humanity to her character. It's just an all around beautifully made film, and I admire everyone involved in the making of it. The director's commentary is also very good and worth listening to, however she gives A LOT away, including parts of the book that weren't included in the film. She does a good job of answering her critics during her commentary, particularly speaking about her reasons for having the characters speak English, which originally struck me as a bit odd, but her reasons are legitimate, and, after all \\"Chocolat\\" & \\"Schindler's List,\\" to name just two, are in English & nobody complained about that. One minor thing that I found annoying, though, was the quality of the disc's supplemental materials- they misspelled...both Cate Blanchett's & novelist Sebastian Faulks' names- shame on them!

038533558X|3.0|Coben's book could have gotten 5 stars; after all it is an inspiring  page-turner of a mystery that is a roller-coaster of suspense. Mystery upon mystery unravels, as the story goes on, making an intriguing delight to the reader. So what brings the rating down a bit? The insipid - rather inspired  - dialogue spoken between the cliched characters with names like &quot;Squares&quot; and &quot;Ghost&quot;. In this day and age of mystery-thrillers can we do without the hero who's a bit too 'suave' for his own good? Can we have a tough-guy with a checkered past WITHOUT a heart of gold? Can we have an innocent suspect who at least, talks cordially to a cop? Can we have conversation between characters in place of tired, sarcastic one-liners? These flaws (slight as they may be to some) are what takes away from the originality of this book, and proves tiresome to the reader.
6300215814|5.0|Quite simply, this is a wonderful movie. Although its status as Audrey Hepburn's best film is questionable, it is beyond debate that it is a sweet, original, enchanting film! And it surely features one of Audrey's best performances. She truly makes Holly Golightly, both a lost little girl and stylish, elegant woman, come to life!<br />Based on the novella by Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany's is essentially about an eccentric, runaway girl living in New York City (Audrey Hepburn) who exists in a swirl of parties and lives off of the gifts of rich men. When a young author (George Peppard), who is actually supported by a wealthy woman, moves in an apartment nearby, a beautiful romance begins to blossom between the two. My summary doesn't really do justice to the beauty and charm of this film (and of its leading actress), but be sure that this is a story you won't forget.<br />So, all in all, this is a beautiful film. Almost like a fairy tale, but more realistic because of the flaws of the characters, its only mistake is Blake Edwards' racist portrayal of the Japanese landlord. And, no matter how many times you see this charming film, you will definitely be crying at the last scene!
B00005R2M3|5.0|When I bought this album, I thought I wouldn't like any of the tracks. But to my surprise, I love every track on this wonderful album! Shakira is the world's biggest rising star, and her music is brilliant. This album is excellent! Rundown:<br />1. Objection (Tango)<br />I love this song, full stop. It has such a cool beginning and the chorus is sooo catchy! 5/5<br />2. Underneath Your Clothes<br />This song is what drew me to Shakira in the first place. I fell in love with this beautiful song with it's breath taking vocals and great music. I liked this song so much, I bought the album! Thank you, Underneath Your Clothes! 5/5<br />3. Whenever, Wherever<br />I hated this song when it was on the radio, to be honest. But when I got the CD, I started liking it. Now I love it's catchy beat and cool vocals. Excellent. 5/5<br />4. Rules<br />This has a ruley guitar beginning. Shakira's telling her man the rules of their relationship. Go Shaks! This song rocks! 5/5<br />5. The One<br />I love this song. It's one of my favourites. It has weird lyrics about shaving her legs and getting over her \\"kitchen phobia\\" but ignore them and you have a cute ballad! I liked this on my first listen. 5/5<br />6. Ready For The Good Times<br />This is a party song! I love it, even with it's weird lyrics! It has a cool beat and great vocals. \\"I'm ready for the good times, ready to get it on....\\" 5/5<br />7. Fool<br />This took awhile to grow on me, but I got hit hard by it! I have fallen in love with this song! It's sooooo gorgeous! I love the beautiful lyrics, and the chorus. I especially love the part at the end of the chorus that goes \\"Huh huh huh huh huh fool\\", it's catchy! MY NEW FAVOURITE SHAKIRA SONG! IT'S SUCH A GORGEOUS SONG! 5555555555555/5<br />8. Te Dejo Madrid<br />The first of the Spanish songs on the album. I love the music, but I have absolutely no idea what she's talking about. It's excellent, anyway. 5/5<br />9. Poem To A Horse<br />A lot of people may be put off by the title of this song, but it's about drugs. It's a catchy ditty with a great beginning. 5/5<br />10. Que Me Quedes Tu<br />Spanish song, again. But this is brilliant. I know the words in Spanish, but I don't know what she's saying. Another song with amazing music. 5/5<br />11. Eyes Like Yours (Ojos Asi)<br />This song was the first song I liked off the album when I first listened to it. I found the Arabian beginning fantastic, and the male vocal an added bonus. Another favourite of mine 5/5<br />12. Suerte (Whenever, Wherever)<br />The Spanish version of Shakira's debut #1. It's better then the English version, actually. It's catchier and faster. I love the ending! 5/5<br />13. Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)<br />I love this! It makes this song even better! 5/5<br />Every song is a 5 star! This has to be my favourite album of all time! Shakira is sooooo beautiful and talented! Her album is the best! I wish I could give it a million stars! :D:D<br />(FOOL IS THE BEST SONG!)
B00004XMSN|4.0|This movie is really quite good - nice for the holidays or for any other day, for that matter. It is very sweet, and features wonderful performances from three classic stars.<br />Essentially, The Bishop's Wife is the story of a bishop (David Niven) who becomes overly obsessed with getting funds for a new cathedral and subsequently neglects his wife and the things that really count. After he prays for help with his project, an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant), arrives to make him see that really counts in his life and to entertain his wife (Loretta Young).<br />An interesting fact about this movie is that, after the initial script was found too dull, several expert writers were brought in (uncredited) to improve the movie. And it worked, because this movie has many good lines and scenes. Most importantly, however, this movie depends on the great performances of its stars. Cary Grant is really the only actor who could have made a role like Dudley seem realistic and interesting, and he pulls it off with his characteristic style, elegance, and charm. Like in all his roles, he plays this one effortlessly and just right. Niven is excellent as the stressed out bishop, and Loretta Young does a nice job as the neglected wife. All in all, a sweet movie!
B000066NW0|5.0|When I first had heard Avril Lavignes single Complicated I knew I had to buy the cd! It was unique and I could relate to the things she was saying. I remember saying to my mom (I have no money of my own lol) can I get it now and she'd say no not until next week I counted the minutes! <br />The cd displays creativity and is up beat! I can relate to some songs more than the other like \\"unwanted\\" \\"complicated\\" and \\"losing grip\\" but that does not me from liking the other tracks like \\"sk8er boi\\" or \\"my world\\"! The writing style she uses makes you able to feel how she felt when she wrote the song even if you had never experienced yourself in that scenario!<br /> From listening to the cd I can tell that *Avril* is deffinetly the star of tomorow and I urge anyone and everyone to buy her cd!!!
B00005NWM3|2.0|After I heard Nickelback's hit song on the radio, I decided to take a chance and buy the CD. But I was very diappointed. Besides &quot;You Remind Me&quot;, there was only one or two other songs I enjoyed on the album.<br />It is really hard to pinpoint why or why not music is good to listen too, but for some reason the majority of the songs on this CD just annoyed me. I thought the lyrics were unoriginal and boring, as was the music itself.<br />If you liked the style of &quot;You Remind Me&quot; or are considering getting this CD, you are much better off getting a CD from similar, but better groups, like Lifehouse, Matchbox 20, or The Calling, all of whose CDs I prefered to this one. So save your money and get something else!
B000002A3T|2.0|THE DIVISION BELL is not a great album, but it's certainly better than A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF RAISINS.For one, RICK WRIGHT was<br />once again a full time member of the group and his jazzy song-<br />writing and keyboard playing is a big part of this album, espe-<br />cially on some of the instrumentals and on the song WEARING THE<br />INSIDE OUT, on which he makes his first lead vocal performance<br />on a PF album since DARK SIDE. I also think there are at least<br />two legit good songs here: WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, with it's<br />agressive guitar playing and it's angry sounding vocals and<br />very appropriate backing vocals, is really quite an enjoyable<br />song. Also, TAKE IT BACK is an upbeat but easy going rocker and<br />pleasant to listen to. If the rest of the album was like these<br />two songs, I may have liked it better. The rest of it isn't all<br />that bad; it's heavy on the keyboards and synths and has more<br />of GILMOUR'S wonderful guitar playing and strong singing and the<br />songs are very soothing and mellow, even when they're not that<br />memorable and it is a nice album to fall asleep to. Still, it is<br />lacking in the lyric department and it's a bit too sad and de-<br />pressing and lacking in wit and humour. It IS better than MOMENT-<br />ARY, but still not on par with any of their ROGER WATERS albums.

B000066JES|5.0|This is easily the most powerful Manowar album ever released; it may even be the best heavy metal album. Manowar shows the other bands, their fans, and themselves what Heavy Metal is all about.<br />Heavy Metal is not people screaming, slamming their instruments, grunting out unintelligible lyrics. At least, it shouldn't be. People need to know that Heavy Metal can have it hard spots, but it can be beautiful... powerful... majestic. This is the true Kingdom of Steel.<br />The album opens with a pretty typical Manowar song. From there it impresses more and more. What other bands could make Italian opera sound so beautiful? What other heavy metal band could perform it and make it sound powerful enough for a metal album, but beautiful enough to stay true to its source material? What heavy metal band could perform an Elvis song, yet make it sound like it was made for Metal? Finally, what metal band can write an original classical composition that people listen to and think is by Wagner? None. These other bands don't have a clue. They get popular by selling their music to whatever movie, TV show, deodorant or Happy Meal pays enough. Their songs consist of very little musically and nothing lyrically. Cheech and Chong's &quot;Earache My Eye&quot; sums up a lot of metal very well: &quot;I only know three chords!&quot; It's all flash and sparkle, no substance. One of the members of Manowar commented that no other band could do Nessun Dorma, because their singing was just 'dogs barking.'<br />But don't think it's all soft. My favorite track is &quot;Swords in the Wind,&quot; which starts out slow and powerful and builds. It is truly the definitive Viking song. No silly nonsense like some of their Viking songs. It's all purely Viking-approved.<br />The power really explodes on the last few tracks. Wonderful, powerful, and hard enough for all of you.<br />Buy this album as an introduction to Manowar. There's something for everyone. And welcome to the Kingdom of Steel.
B00005ABIP|5.0|In my opinion, CAKE is one of the best bands out there. This cd is great.  Although it says it's explicit lyrics, it's not.  The only cuss word is hell, and it's not even bad in the context they put it in. They don't talk about anything bad either like killing people or whatever and I really don't know who decides if it's parental advisory or not but this cd definately should not be. All of the songs are good, but my favorite is Never There. I highly reccomend picking this one up, if you have the means.
6303415571|5.0|Recorded live at the Rainbow Theatre December 1972. This brilliant performance became a really great video for any true fan of the earlier forms of Yes (and not for the people who like their 80's stuff like \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart\\"). First the video starts out with some moving artwork from the great Roger Dean to the music of the middle instrumental section of the studio version of \\"Close To The Edge\\".<br />Then after the title shows up, the band goes right into \\"I've Seen All Good People\\". The way it's played is great but Rick Wakeman's organ crescendo at the end of the first half doesn't compare to that of organ great Tony Kaye on the studio recording.<br />After that is a nice version of \\"The Clap\\" with just Steve Howe and his Martin 0014 Acosutic Guitar.<br />Then some tunes from their latest studio album (at the time), first comes \\"And You And I\\" where they skip Steve Howe's 12-String acoustic guitar intro (but uses a white Gibson EDS-1275 SG Double-Neck Guitar for the other parts that do require 12-String Guitar) but do an alternate beginning (and a more revelatory one at that). Then comes \\"Close To The Edge\\" Yes's 6th Longest song though clocking in at 18:40...<br />Anyway enough with Yes's longest tunes, back to Close To The Edge, through out the song at different times there are clips of underwater microscopic life which in my opinion should have been left out, and just showed the band play. The song is very close to the original studio version, except the end where they drop it a step from F to E flat (I guess because Jon Anderson's voice couldn't take the pressure he put on it like on the album).<br />Anyway a little stage chatter and Anderson kissing his microphone he introduces Rick Wakeman to do his \\"Excerpts From The Six Wives Of Henry The VIII\\". Though he plays the song by himself, he has Alan White smash cymbals and a couple drums to accompany the classical crescendos of Handel's \\"The Messiah\\" and (if you can believe it) \\"Jingle Bells\\" (but understand it was December of 1972 when this video was recorded so it was appropiate).<br />Then comes \\"Roundabout\\", I'd prefer the studio version over this, because the band just wasn't able to capture the same kind of magic onstage that was in the studio recording, like Chris Squire's ascending bass riff was dull, Steve Howe had to play his solo introduction on his Gibson ES-5 Switchmaster Electric Guitar instead of his Martin 0014 Acoustic Guitar, and Rick Wakeman's organ had a bit less shine then on the original recording. It was OK but they could have improved on it a bit.<br />Then comes \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\", a better recording than the original. A nice pop-ish intro, and Steve has a nice unaccompanied solo in the middle (except for Alan White with a little bit of Phased High Hat and Chris Squire shoving in Fuzzy Bass Notes in at times). The only drawback is that after Steves Solo was over they skipped the middle section (ya know; \\"Death Defying, Mutilated, Army's Gather Near\\"), but instead right into the end just because they were running short on time. But altogether an electrifying performance.<br />Then the end credits with the last 2 minutes of Starship Trooper, Steve with his Double Neck Guitar, Chris with Fuzzed Bass, Jon at the mellotron next to Alan, while Rick does an amazing Moog Solo.<br />A very fine performance for Yes at probably the peak of their fame in 1972-73. Get the video if you want, but be warned once you watch, you will be hooked.tand it was December of 1972 when this video was recorded so it was appropiate).<br />Then comes \\"Roundabout\\", I'd prefer the studio version over this, because the band just wasn't able to capture the same kind of magic onstage that was in the studio recording, like Chris Squire's ascending bass riff was dull, Steve Howe had to play his solo introduction on his Gibson ES-5 Switchmaster Electric Guitar instead of his Martin 0014 Acoustic Guitar, and Rick Wakeman's organ had a bit less shine then on the original recording. It was OK but they could have improved on it a bit.<br />Then comes \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\", a better recording than the original.

B00005UW9T|2.0|This is, easily, the worst animation flick i've seen (not counting Quest for Camelot).  Not only is it historically inaccurate (forgiveable, maybe, since most kids' -and adults', for that matter- movies are), but the voices (Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Christopher Lloyd) are overdone.  They sound desperate.  To get out, maybe.  Oh, and did i mention the obligatory romance element?<br />Midway, i was already missing the usual Disney features, but i guess nothing better (animation-wise) came out that year.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is one of the most facinating mysteries I have every seen. Not told from the elegant upstairs point of view, but by the gossiping servants below stairs. This humorous mystery deserves a place in film history.
B0000640VO|5.0|the movie was great, probably the best romantic/comedy movie i've ever seen, but it's too bad it's in french, and in france. with the director's masterful job on the screen, and then to be distracted by reading silly sub-titles, it's blasphemy. this movie left me with a smirk, which I held almost through the entire movie, as i thought it was such a well-written and interesting story. i like the narrator and how it gives direct characerizations since the movie is so flavored with the many characters amelie helps. too bad it's rated R for some naughty scenes and dirty thoughts.
B000060P79|5.0|I think that this band is very under rated because I think they are better than Blink 182!!! This band definately made an impression on me when I first heard them!! I love them so much and I suggest that you buy thier cd! they have an upbeat Punk Rock sound that makes you want to get up and start dancing! This music is definately some of the best punk music ever! go and buy it now!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I have to say, Russell Crowe is a pure genius in the art of acting. I know they shouldn't be compared, but I found Russell Crowe to have been strangely similar to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, with his facial expressions and body language. For the subject matter, it is quite well-played, as his illness shocked me up until about 20 minutes before it ended. One awkward thing about the movie: the marriage. I really can't see what Jenniffer Connelly's character has for this guy, but I guess if that's how the real-life love's story played, then it's okay. Gives a new light on schizophrenia in public conditions, however I find it odd a genius, especially,  would have such a problem getting rid of it after meeting new people and such, since it formed from his loneliness. That fault kind of left me [angry], but it's okay if it's true. I would have liked a bunch of his invisible friends to be on stage when was accepting the award poking fun at him or asking him to go on a 'mission', that would have been hilarious.
0679879269|5.0|Let me first say that I am not an avid reader of fantasy.  But this book, like the other two books in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series always kept me reading.  The author has woven many complex themes and plot lines together to form a colorful and interesting story.  While \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is a fantasy, the author, Philip Pulman, has written it in a way that the story seems every bit as realistic and believable as one without the magic.  The plot is not just spells and broomsticks, but involves themes such as parallel universes and comparisons for souls.  However, the ending was not as good as it was in the other two books and seems to drag out for a bit long.  But this doesn't make much diffeence compared to the rest of the book.  I thouroughly enjoyed \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" but would suggest reading it directly after the other two books.  I read other books in between and forgot some of the smaller details mentioned previously in the other two books in the trilogy. FInally, I would recommend \\"The Amber SPyglass\\" to anyone over the age of 11.  I don't think kids 11 and under would appreciate some of the themes and parts may get a bit scary.
B000002LCE|5.0|Released in 1987, *Dream Evil* showcases new guitarist Craig Goldy.  This is probably the most melodic of the DIO &quot;solo&quot; albums...an extremely tight production, rich keyboards are plentiful.<br />I interviewed Ronnie recently and he said that every album he writes and records reflects where he was at, at that stage of his life.  This album has several references<BR>to &quot;Dreams&quot;...perhaps an acknowledgement to dreams he had then realized having finally made it &quot;on his own&quot; after a successful run with Rainbow &amp; Black Sabbath.<br />As a lyricist, imagery is Ronnie Dio's strongpoint...*Dream Evil* is abundant with it...and the music compliments those words perfectly.<br />One of Dio's finest works.<br />-Dan<BR>07-20-02
0515123447|2.0|What is it with British genre writers? They love to set their stories in the U.S., but actually researching the country seems to be too much work. So they wing it. Or they invent silly plot gimmicks to explain their lapses. Lee Child does both.<br />The big gimmick here is that Jack Reacher has spent his entire life outside the U.S., first as a Marine Corps brat, then as an officer in the U.S. Army MPs. This is supposed to explain how he's &quot;exploring America&quot; and relatively ignorant of its ways.<br />It's a pretty bogus gimmick (I can't think of any more &quot;American&quot; place to grow up than a U.S. miltary base -- even the ones overseas). And it doesn't do anything for a lot of related lapses, like the fact nobody investigating a counterfeiting ring seems to have ever heard of the Secret Service!<br />There are more lapses of a more logical nature. The story begins with a very engaging scene where Reacher is arrested by a group of heavily-armed well-trained cops. The scene is interesting because Reacher spends the arrest critiquing the police technique of the arresting officers (they're colleagues after all!). His assessment is that they're very-well trained, with a few minor lapses that turn out to be crucial to the plot.<br />Except that it makes no sense. It turns out that the cops work for a backwater city with no history of violent crime, and every reason *not* to want well-trained cops around.<br />Add to the mix an unlikely scheme for buying off every single inhabitant of the town, a lot of flawed logic as Reacher and his cohorts &quot;deduce and detect&quot;, a fair number of coincidences and improbabilities, and you end up with a story that's just plain dumb.<br />There's also a lot of violence. It struck me as realistic enough -- actually too realistic for my taste. If that's what you like in your thrillers, by all means, buy this book. But lets not pretend there's anything deep here.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is the perfect example of an album that seperates the true fansd from those who like RHCP because a the style of music they produce. RHCP first came into the big spotlight with Blood Sugar Sex Magik, having listened to this album an uncountable number of times, i can safely say that is is one of the purest and most eneregetic albums i have ever heard, and the only drawback i see (aside from a few songs, Under The bridge notably) is that is albuy is lacking some real honesty and emoption. Energy yes, genuine feeling, no. That is why this album and BSSM are polar opposites at the end of the \\"good\\" spectrum. This album is oozing authenticity and a rare kind a perspicacity that is not found much these days. Not only are these albums sattilites for eachother in quality, they also are connected very well by the two albums that seperate them. One Hot Minute was a strage, off kilter album that I alot much of its lack of quality to the heroin the band, or at least what was left of it at the time (John Fruchonte, the guitarrist was replaced by Dave Navarro because of his entry into heroin rehab), but was still softer then BSSM, but on ikts way to the pivotal Californication. Wich was a CD that i feel was the bands major turning point where they didnt do so much of a 180 as it was a 90 degree turn in the derection of melancholy, slightly upbeat tunes. This band is constantly evolving and what is has becaome is a fabulus band that has proved that they are one of the if not the most versatile group out there. They have truly matured from the days of Freaky Styley and Mothers Milk, listening to they're oldie \\"Get Up and Jump\\" and i was stuck at how far they have come. By The Way, they title track  will play very nicely with the musically immature craving their old funk band back. Universally Speaking boasts wonderful guitar licks and some great vocals, This Is The Place is one of my favoites of the album with some brilliant lyrics and kick ass bass playing, Dosed is this first of a series of beautiful, melancholy and slightly upbeat ballads that the Chili Peppers have perfected over the years. Don't Forget Me is a brooding and sad portrait of sex drugs and consequences with a hook that breaks your heart. The Zephyr Song proves wrong any who say the Chili Peppers have lost their optimism, a feel good song for all occasions. Can't Stop shows of the Zen like balence of raw energy and self control the guys have learned over the years with a juicy and rockin guitar line that a pleasure to hear and echoes some of their old work, though the rest of the song doesn't. I Could Die For You is just about a gorgeous a track as you could ever ask for, sad, emotional, authentic....damn these guys are good. A perfect followup is Midnight, a similar but slightly more bitter and cynical verson (\\"just a minute while i reinvent myself/make is up and then i take it off the shelf\\") of the previous song. Throw Away Your Television is a rockin good time, hard, energetic...but is comes out as the misfit of the album, almost Radioheadlike in its execution and message, still execellent. Cabron (NOT Carbon) is one of the most daring moves RHCP has made in a long time, massively latin flavored, rich, textured, and very danceable this seemingly random and beautiful thread is my favorite on the album though it may not be recieved so well by the funk lovers. Tear, introspective, knowing, very chill...excellent example of that the peppers have become. On Mercury, bopping, driving music, fun lyrics, pure enjoyment. Minor Thing, fresh air, more driving music, good rapping. Venice Queen, a two part song with a new, surreal sound in the first half and a more classic Peppers second half.<BR>     The key to this album is to have a open mind, and ber willing to accept the fact that these guys have matures, listen and you will see that they have improved, and if you crave that ferocity forund in Righteous and the Wicked and Funky Monks you can always just pop in BSSM, this album is ment for a different layer and  works just as effectively. Five stars, listen carefully, and dont miss a thing.
B00005K3OT|4.0|The battle of the senses vs. the spirit is on in Chocolat, a movie about a red-cloaked unmarried mother breezing into a gray-roofed Catholic town and bringing with her all the mystery and healing of chocolate during the Lenten season.  Her direct enemy:  the Count, who runs both the town and the church and is as devout as he is rigid.<br />The performances in this movie (which is in English, by the way) are uniformly satisfying; the script is good; and nothing negative sticks out about the editing or the direction.  What really captures the imagination, however, isn't the story but the lush cinematography, which draws particular attention to the chocolate.  The chocolate itself is the lead character in this movie, imbued with magic, sexuality, the spirit of womanhood, and rebellion against all things patriarchal or institutional.<br />Worth your time if you like your films sweet and smooth.
0441172717|5.0|In the first novel of his entrancing saga, Frank Herbert takes his audiences captive with the haunting epic of the desert planet, Arrakis. Herbert displays his unique capability for blending the elements of religion, politics, culture and nature perfectly to form a society that is, though alien, slightly reminiscent of the world today. Though fantastical and outlandish, Arrakis is very realistic and believable world.<BR>The novel takes place primarily on Arrakis, also known as Dune. A place where water is a luxury and the sun is the ultimate enemy of a man. Many secrets are buried within Dune's sands, many of which only its natives, the Fremen, are aware of. One mystery that the government has still not reasoned out is the spice, melange. The addictive spice practically runs the universe, giving the Guild navigators their enhanced navigational skills and Muad'Dib his prescience. Strangely, though, the spice is only found on Arrakis, and quite abundantly. All of this Paul Atreides must encounter when his father, Duke Leto, accepts the fief of Arrakis. However, through a series of events involving the Atreides' arch rival, the Harkonnens, Paul and his mother, Jessica, must flee to the desert, leaving behind Paul's inheritance as Duke. When Paul encounters the spice-filled desert, the prescience that he always possessed is enhanced to the point of sensing truth and predicting the future. Hiding in the cover of the desert, Paul and Jessica are taken in by the Fremen and accepted into their religion. It is through the Fremen that Paul becomes the notorious Muad'Dib, and the long awaited Messiah of the Fremen, destined to lead them in battle. However, the battle is not only with the Harkonnens, but the Bene Gesserit also. The Bene Gesserit are the founders of a human breeding program to reach the goal of creating a Kwistatz Haderach, the ultimate human. <BR>Soon, the man known as Muad'Dib must fight the battle with his old enemies, the Harkonnens and his own future. <BR>This book is a classic science fiction masterpiece that displays the immense talent and imagination of its author, Frank Herbert. It challenges the imagination, inspires the mind, and fills the senses until you feel you can taste the melange on your tongue and feel the desert sand of Arrakis on beneath your feet. If you appreciate intelligent literature, this book will not disappoint you.
0767802470|5.0|Das Boot is without a doubt the definitive U-boat/submarine combat thriller. This is an excellent story that has gotten all the credit it deserves, it's only a shame more American filmwatchers havent seen this yet, or in many cases, heard of it.<br />The other 100+ reviews for this film cover it very well, and I will just add emphasis on how one needs to see this film. Not often is a movie made about Germans in WWII with even a slight degree of objectivity, this one shines above all with its portrayal of German submariners at sea, and quite entertaining as well as truthful.<br />The DVD quality is excellent, with extra footage throughout the film and no screen loops when the DVD is switching layers. You wont be disapointed with this film.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is great and I think anyone out there who likes music will like this! Avril is not just another Britney Spears, but a tom-boyish girl who doesn't care what other people think about her. She has a great voice and her lyrics send out great messages about many things, not just guys. I recommend this CD to everyone!
B000003S0B|5.0|....as it's said to be like \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\", King Crimson's debut album. There are some similarities: the blending of fiery, jazz-rock numbers counterbalanced by smooth, r&b influenced tracks. On the whole, this album seems to carry more diversity than the debut does. It starts with the trippy, vocal experimentation of Peace (A Beginning), which is followed by the manic, fiery jazz-rock of Pictures Of A City. This has been compared to 21st Century Schizoid Man. It features that same sound effect, what I might describe as an ambulance alarm set on fire, I don't know if it's Robert Fripp's guitar or the sax producing it (you'll know what I'm talking about when you hear the track). Cadence And Cascade is an ethereal r&b/rock tune that's been compared to I Talk To The Wind (you know...the track that sounds as if The Everly Brothers were singing a song whose lyrics were written by Black Sabbath? A \\"Dream...Dream...Dream-y\\" concept unto itself). This features some of Robert Fripp's melodic and tasteful guitar playing. The vocals are very beautiful as well. In The Wake Of Poseidon (often compared to Epitath) is probably my personal favorite on here. An ingratiating mix of r&b, psychedelia and symphonic rock, combined with impassioned vocals makes this arguably the standout amongst many greats. Peace (A Theme) is a melodious guitar instrumental that prepares you for the manic, jazz/funk rock of Cat Food, which features absurd and silly lyrics of a Zappa-esque nature. The Devil's Triangle, like ELP's Abbadon's Bolero (see Trilogy), is a dark, chaotic, sci-fi/cinematic instrumental. Listen for a section from The Court Of The Crimson King (title track from debut) at the very end of this song. The album closes with Peace (An End), which features sad vocal delivery from Greg Lake. Sad, as in this was Greg's very last vocal performance with Crimson, as he would join the mighty ELP. Overall, this King Crimson album deserves to be owned, and if approached without thought of the debut, can be considered a classic.thought of the debut, can be considered a classic.
0679441018|5.0|This is my favorite of all her books. This book is like Anne's version of Dante's Inferno. It's amazing, very philosophical. It sheds a different light on Lestat. You can see the Jewish, and Catholic influence. I highly recommend this book. I own it as well as all the other Vampire Chronicles, and I have read it five times already, and I am sure I will read many more times.
B0000028RR|5.0|they're not sellouts, they are not a weak band, and they are not stupid.<br />Rage Against the Machine was one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time. This album is their best b/c it solidifies their style, a new one at that, and makes sure people get their moneys worth. Unlike other bands that just don't live up to the hype, (i.e. Limp Bizkit, Nine Inch Nails) Rage Against teh machine delivers.<br />I think the best tracks, while all of them are great are &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; w/ Maynard of Tool, and &quot;Freedom&quot; their first single. Freedom is just one of the greatest songs I've ever heard.<br />buy this record. if you are going to own any Rage album this is it. cuz this is where it started. LA is another good one, so is Empire. but you might want to forget about Renegades.<br />two thumbs up, way up.<br />remember..<br />your anger is a gift.
B00005JL0I|4.0|NOTE: This review is NOT for the \\"Casino Royale (40th Anniversary Edition)\\" DVD despite the fact that Amazon also lists the review on the product page for that 2007 DVD (note the 2002 date of this review). This review is associated with the DVD released in 2002 - which is available on Amazon. The review references this edition of the movie: http://www.amazon.com/Casino-Royale-David-Niven/dp/B00005JL0I/ref=cm_rdp_product<br /><br />Finally this comedic take on the James Bond series makes its way onto DVD, and for completists and fans of James Bond this 2002 DVD promises not only the 1967 version of Ian Flemings first 007 novel but also an edited down version of the very first James Bond movie, the 1950s CBS TV movie that starred Barry Nelson as James Bond (thats right, Sean Connery was NOT the first actor to portray 007). Made for an American audience, the character of James Bond is a CIA agent in that show and Leiter is the British intelligence agent. That movie, which is listed as a special feature on this DVD, also starred Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre. Made in the days of live television this entertaining oddity is worth watching for the bloopers alone.<br />Years later, the rights to \\"Casino Royale\\" made it into the hands of another movie producer who, convinced that any attempt to make a serious version of \\"Casino Royale\\" would be doomed without the talents of Sean Connery, decided to make the remake as a comedy instead. With Peter Sellers playing James Bond and Orson Welles taking on the role of Le Chiffre everything seemed to be going fine until a script dispute caused Sellers to walk out on the project. Left with half a movie the producers were in trouble and they scrambled to save their production. One needs to understand this background to the movie to understand why it turned out the way it did. In it's final version it seems truly confused with several actors portraying the role of James Bond and several directors (including John Huston who also cameos as M) taking a crack at it. There is even an early appearance by Woody Allen and former Bond girl Ursula Andress. For me personally, the Peter Sellers scenes are especially brilliant and very funny and David Niven plays the perfect gentleman spy. The action comes thick and fast and in addition to Andress there are a number of actors familiar to devotees to the rival EON productions. This movie is trulycameos as M) taking a crack at it.

B000067CPX|2.0|Boring boring boring album. What happened? I'm a fan. I've seen them play tiny, sweaty clubs and huge stadiums. But I'm tired of the sad, slow, listless tracks. Serioulsy. I can't be the only one. These guys used to be funky. They used to rock. They used to have an attitude. They were wild. Now they're tired. I don't want pretty music coming from my chili peppers. Where's the funk? Where's the big sound? Sure, they can &quot;grow up&quot; but do it with some energy for crying out loud. The next album better be produced by George Clinton again, or at least have a  horn section! Please! Get out of this phase! I need something to bug out to on my house boat! Thank you.
0380977788|5.0|Coraline is no exception from the wonderfull books that Mr. Gaiman has written.  It has a very creepy, eerie, scary feel to it.  At times I could feel my heart beating against my chest as the author continued to write about Coraline's search for the children's lost souls.  It has the feel of an old Grimm's fairy tale mixed with Alice in Wonderland, and a touch of Gaiman's twisted dark fantasy thrown in for good measure.<br />I definitely recomend buying Coraline. <br />Why are you still reading? Buy it already.
B000006045|4.0|The task of finding good new music is a difficult one. Massive Attack is producing a very nice alternative to pop mainstream music. Mezzaninie continues their blend of electronic soul dub style that was evident on their previous releases Blue Lines &amp; Protection.The nice thing about Mezzanine is they have pretty much abandoned the tired hip hop influence for a more mature sound. It's not anything groundbreaking it's just fine moody music that gives those in search of  more creative artists a bit of hope.Massive Atack hasn't spawned a crop of imitators yet but maybe their limited success will wake some folks up and we can look forward to a new alternative wave. It ain't here yet.

0380820846|4.0|This mystery is entwined into a large part of this story. Lady Danbury announces a reward for finding out &quot;Who IS Miss Whistledown&quot; and as in previous novels you are quite in a fervor to figure it out, and JQ does a splendid job with making sure you have lots of candidates to choose from. ((smile))Penelope we have watch grow from the earlier books and I must say I rather enjoyed how JQ allowed Penelope to mature and become comfortable in her status as a &quot;spinster&quot; but I also must point out that she has quite a back bone and &quot;knows&quot; what she wants she isn't afraid to do (or say something) that isn't acceptable by society standards. Colin is still quite the charming debonair gentleman but I felt like he lacked somehting and I can't quite put my finger on it.<br />There is witty dialogue that you have come to associate with Ms. Quinns work and you do get to see your favorite old characters return. I absolutely adore &quot;Violet&quot; the Mother of all of these Bridgerton's and Lady Danbury becomes quite endearing in this tale. I won't say much about the plot because that would spoil the anticipation. I will say that there are displays of friendship in this book that I found quite endearing and had to wipe a tear or 2 from my eyes, (sigh) Eloise has something up her sleeve that I think shall be revealed in the next Bridgerton book coming out in 2003. I think there are only 2 siblings left in the aphabetical order to be married off, it seems that JQ had 2 of them taken care of without writing their stories LOL anyhoo so we just have Hyacinth and Eloise to look forward to.<br />Overall I liked this book I can't say I had a lot of &quot;Laugh Out Loud&quot; moments as I did with &quot;The Viscount Who Loved Me&quot; or some of her earlier books but I do think that it's worth the time and appreciate her efforts. Is it a &quot;Keeper&quot;? urhhhh well yes ONLY because it is a part of a series and because you collect this authors work, if it wasn't for those 2 considerations then I probably wouldn't vote to keep it in my Library.<br />Does the mystery of &quot;Who Miss Whistledown is&quot; get's solved you'll definately have to pick up the book to find out..

6300218031|5.0|One of my favourite movies ever. A feel good movie with a thumping soundtrack, SKOW has an ending that although a little cheesy has one of the classic ending lines. (watch it to find out!). Mary Stuart Masterson is outstanding (and outstandingly cute in leather and denim!) as the Drum playing Tomboy Watts who has fallen for the artistic non-conforming Keith (Eric Stolz). The storyline is a little predictable (or maybe thats just cos I've seen it too many times) but you just don't care as the film<BR>takes you through all the emotions you remember in your own teenage angst ridden years. A must see for any 'teen' of the late 80's or early 90's.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Containing all three movies on four discs with a full disc of extra material, &quot;The Godfather DVD Collection&quot; is a must have for fans of Francis Ford Coppola's epic trilogy.  The movies are all there in the original versions (rather than having the scenes arranged chronologically, which the most recent VHS collection attempted to do).  On the bonus disc, among the many great extras is a generous helping of scenes that weree cut, over an hour's worth.  Some of them were understandably left out, but others provide even more insight into the motivations of the characters.  Some characters that were cut out altogether, like Tom Hagen's wife, Theresa, make their first public appearances now thirty years after the first film's release.<br />For all of its minor flaws, the Godfather trilogy represents a truly amazing bit of filmmaking, namely nine hours of incredible imagary, acting and storytelling all taken from a pop novel that is not in any way, shape or form considered to be great literature.  The DVD format gives the movies their full due.<br />Overall, this collection has become THE one to own for Godfather fans.
B00003CXCS|5.0|Except for a few bitter, miserable, cynical Eastern pseudo-intellectual types, this film is universally loved. What's not to love? Let's list some of my favorite things about this movie: A breathtaking score by Richard Rodgers, a lush orchestration of the same, sun washed cinematography, wonderful scenery of Austria, vocals by the three octave  range Andrews and the children, a fun story line with just enough history to teach us something, an intriguing romance, and not one foul word, stabbing, overblown special effect, sex perversion or bloodstain to spoil it all. The editing is so good that it is unnoticeable - but effective. If you hate this film, you are probably \\"seriously maladjusted\\" (as Richard Rodgers said about a critic who despised the film because its wholesome children and theme).  Everyone else, enjoy!
B00005KHEU|3.0|ELO hit their sales peak with the massive hit &quot;Don't Bring Me Down,&quot; from the album &quot;Discovery.&quot;  And while the song is one of their best, the album it is drawn from is inconsistant at best.  Other songs that stand out include the catchy &quot;Last Train to London,&quot; &quot;Shine a Little Love,&quot; and &quot;Confusion,&quot; all worthy follow ups to &quot;Don't Bring Me Down.&quot;  The rest is a peculiar mixed bag of filler material including the really awful &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp,&quot; which represents leader Jeff Lynne's songwriting at its most theatrically horrid.  Note that the best songs here are also available on ELO's various anthology albums.<br />Overall, an uneven album that contains some very good songs.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I think that anyone who went to see 'Resident Evil' expecting character development or a witty script are foolish.  This is the kind of no-brainer entertainment that is good fun at the cinema and from this perspective it is actually pretty good.  The story has Jovovich playing a...babe with memory loss who, along with a group of army officers infiltrate an underground research facility called The Hive.  Unknown to the public above this is where the hugely influential Umbrella Corporation has been researching the deadly T-Virus, that reanimates the dead.  However, the Red Queen computer mainframe killed all of the Hive's employees after a security scare.  Now it's up to the cast to find out what went on there.<br />First of all I'll go through everything that's wrong with this movie.  Most glaringly, there are several long scenes which just have the cast shooting at zombies, which I could have seen playing the game at home.  Other things critics have labelled as ridiculous mostly adds to the movie's trashy fun.  For instance, check out the employees of The Hive, all researching a top-secret virus over cups of coffee and all under 25.  On top of that we have Jovovich parading about in a red dress split at the thigh, and whilst the rest of the cast are bitten and maimed she remains with a few delicate smears of dust across her face.  Unfortunately, the story is very inconsistent, and for a while the audience can't be sure what's going on, why Red Queen's mainframe couldn't be overriden from outside and who everyone is supposed to be.<br />Still, there's actually plenty of elements here that mean 'Resident Evil' is a cut above other computer game adaptations.  Despite being almost totally reliant on dumb jump scares, there's a few things here that have the ability to make you recoil in disgust and a few other creepy elements.  For anyone that's seen similar movies, you just know that when we focus in on the dead woman pressed against the glass of a research lab that she'll open her eyes suddenly.  Thankfully knowing what's coming doesn't take away from a lot of genuinely enjoyable aspects.  For example, the Red Queen's manifestation as a little girl is great fun, as are the zombie Dobermans and Michelle Rodriguez is fantastic in what could easily be a very unrewarding role.<br />Although this is certainly no classic, it's a good watch and is a lot better than 'Tomb Raider' or 'Street Fighter'.  Even so, anyone over the age of 30 will be scratching their heads, but that's probably the idea, what with a Slipknot-laden soundtrack.
B00005KHEU|3.0|ELO hit their sales peak with the massive hit &quot;Don't Bring Me Down,&quot; from the album &quot;Discovery.&quot;  And while the song is one of their best, the album it is drawn from is inconsistant at best.  Other songs that stand out include the catchy &quot;Last Train to London,&quot; &quot;Shine a Little Love,&quot; and &quot;Confusion,&quot; all worthy follow ups to &quot;Don't Bring Me Down.&quot;  The rest is a peculiar mixed bag of filler material including the really awful &quot;The Diary of Horace Wimp,&quot; which represents leader Jeff Lynne's songwriting at its most theatrically horrid.  Note that the best songs here are also available on ELO's various anthology albums.<br />Overall, an uneven album that contains from very good songs.
B000001EHS|2.0|[I LOVE Def Leppard, and that's why I'm being so critical on this release. Don't give me a NO vote unless you have a good reason for it.]<br />I've listened to bad greatest hits albums before but this one just takes the cake. Half the songs are ballads, and they are way out of their original release order. Read my comments on each track to see why it should or should not have been included:<br />1. Pour Some Sugar on Me: This is the band's most popular song so it should be on this album. However, because it is so much different from their other material it should have been later in the tracklist.<br />2. Photograph: Good song, no complaints<br />3. Love Bites: A good song overall, but this track alone was the precursor to Def Leppard becoming a pop band. I would have preferred some of their earlier \\"gloom and doom\\" ballads (Sorrow Is A Woman, Too Late For Love) instead of this.<br />4. Let's Get Rocked: Good song, but it was never a hit.<br />5. Two Steps Behind [Acoustic Version]: Because this is the band's most successful ballad I can't argue with them putting it on here.<br />6. Animal: Sure it was a hit, BUT IT'S NOT A GOOD SONG! Let's see, this makes half of the album so far Hysteria material.<br />7. Foolin': Good song, no complaints.<br />8. Rocket: Another Hysteria hit, but it's almost as bad as Animal. Why did those two tracks get put on here and not Women?<br /> 9. When Love & Hate Collide: This unreleased track is a generic ballad, so don't get your hopes up.<br />10. Armageddon It: This is the best song from Hysteria, so I'm glad it's here. This song is the one that got me into the band, too!<br />11. Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad: NO WAY THIS SHOULD BE HERE. Yet another ballad, and it was never a hit.<br />12. Rock of Ages: Decent song, but I'd rather have seen Too Late For Love.<br />13. Hysteria: Good ballad, the band isn't wimping out in this one. BUT TALK ABOUT HYSTERIA AND BALLAD OVERKILL!<br />14. Miss You in a Heartbeat [Acoustic Version]:NO WAY THIS SHOULD BE HERE. Yet another ballad, and it was never a hit.<br />15. Bringin' on the Heartbreak: Great song, one of the early \\"gloom and doom\\" ballads. I'm glad it's here, but this IS NOT the complete version with the Switch 625 instrumental sequence following.<br />So it's Def Leppard's greatest hits WITHOUT Ride Into The Sun (Version 1) Hello America, Overture, It Don't Matter, Sorrow Is A Woman, Lady Strange, Too Late For Love, Comin' Under Fire, Die Hard The Hunter, Women, Gods Of War, Heaven Is, or Make Love Like A Man? And it's Def Leppard's greatest hits WITH Rock Of Ages, Animal, Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad, Miss You In A Heartbeat, a new generic ballad, and INCOMPLETE VERSIONS of Bringin' On The Heartbreak and Rocket? THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL.<br />I like Def Leppard a good deal, but this is NOT a good retrospect of their career in ANY way. They should have had two greatest hits albums, Rock Years (On Through The Night-Hysteria) and Pop Years (Adrenalize-Euphoria.) As proven here a single disc with an uneven mix of material does no justice to fans of the band's early hard rock stylings. ...
B000002UBB|4.0|&quot;Fly Like and Eagle,&quot; can almost stand as a Steve Miller greatest hits album on its own.  The title track, &quot;Rock'n'Me,&quot; and &quot;Take the Money and Run,&quot; are three of Miller's best known songs, while &quot;Serenade,&quot; &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot; and &quot;Wild Mountain Honey&quot; also appear on his 1974-78 Greatest Hits album.  This was Miller at his radio friendly best, hook laden songwriting, ace lead guitar work, warm vocals and lyrics that occasionally soar with the music.  The best of these songs still hold up a quarter of a centry later.  The only down notes are the by-the-numbers cover of Sam Cooke's &quot;You Send Me&quot; and the fact that the rest of the material is filler, but that's just quibbling.<br />Overall, this is (arguably) the best of Steve Miller's original studio albums.
B00005JA2B|5.0|What a classic recording this is.  Wonderful production, excellent musicianship, and songwriting that rivals much of what else came out over the last 30 years.  This is a classic recording which belongs in any real collection.<br />Queen had \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", The Beatles had \\"Sgt Pepper\\".  Leftoverture is Kansas' peak recording.  Grand in scope and stylish in execution, this CD shows a great band at the height of it's power.  <br />Judging Leftoverture only from hearing the radio staple \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" is unfair...and while that song may have been played to death by classic rock radio over the years, the rest of the recording remained (for the most part) off the airwaves.  \\"What's On My Mind\\" is a rocker that reminds me of Boston to a degree, and \\"Cheyenne Anthem\\" is a rocking, yet emotionally moving song about the loss of indian lands.  To me, the gem of this album comes in the five-part suite \\"Magnum Opus\\".  This is a progressive rock masterpiece on par with \\"2112\\" by Rush, \\"Supper's Ready\\" by Genesis, or \\"Close To The Edge\\" by Yes.<br />Some albums have masterpiece written all over them, and this is one of them.  I say 5-stars all the way!<br />As I see it:<br />5-Stars:  If you like Kansas, progressive rock, or classic rock with strong musicianship.<br />4-Stars:  If you like more modern music, but want to add classics to your collection.<br />3-Stars:  If you lean more toward metal, alternative, or any of the numerous other newer genres of music.<br />2-Stars:  If your taste in 70's music leans more toward Velvet Underground, Ramones, etc., or you really like much more straight ahead rock.<br />1-Star: If you are tone deaf, or just won't listen to anything before 1988.
0790732203|5.0|Here we have a movie about a young man who enlists the services of an &quot;interpersonal relationship field technician level one expert&quot;.Things get out of hand rather quickly for him and Lana kind of spins his head around-sometimes a woman can do that to a guy.I thought Ms.DeMornay's character was strong and Tom Cruises character was rattlebrained and weak. I thought all the cast fit together good and the movie was great and in the end Joel(Tom) got the break and I guess he got the girl in real life too.Personally I think Tom Cruise is overated as an actor but I'm not a dizzy broad,I'm a guy so I guess it's a girl thing!Anyway it's worth watching!
B000002NBY|5.0|I've just received my copy of this CD and my only regret is that I waited so many years to get it.<br />This first came out about the time of apartheid and unrest in South Africa, so I wrote it off to &quot;entertainer angst&quot; (or worse).  But I've been enjoying the well played tunes (The Boy in the Bubble, Graceland, Diamonds..., Call me Al, Under African Skies)all this time without realizing that they all came from the Graceland CD.  The driving bass/drums and pleasing african-style harmonies deeply satisfy in a &quot;I want something new&quot; manner.<br />I look forward to discovering the rest of the CD.  I'm sure it will become a well-played favorite for me.<br />A curious side-note about my copy of this CD: it contains an installable software package that apparently plays videos and music.  It doesn't work very well on my system running Win XP, as it was issued about the time of Win '95, but features like that eventually make for a prized collector's item.  I'm tempted to set up a Win '95 system just to see how the thing works.
6303168507|5.0|First of all I thought the acting was good!I have a few questions about the content.I'll put that another way.I would like to see a movie that might address why the allies did not know about these camps until the Allies entered Germany.Allied bombers had no problems locating German factories and other military and civillian targets, but I never heard of prisoner of war camps or concentation camps being bombed-explain that-maybe the pilots were very lucky!Also I do not understand how people could be killed only for their religious beliefs but allied prisoners who were killing your countrymen were taken prisoner and treated according to some war rules!That doesn't make sense to me.I do not doubt nor defend any justice in the killing of any Jewish people in any way, that was horrible!I just have some questions.I will say that my mother and her family were on the receiving end of allied bombing thank God it wasn't in Dresden or Hamburg! My father is post war U.S. soldier and mother postwar West German!She accepts that as war and has been flying a U.S.flag long before 9-11-01 happened.I guess my review drifted of course abit,the movie and actors were great but alot of innocent people died in that war,not just one group!Also Hollywood sometimes gets critisized for violence but rarely gets praise they sometimes deserve,people have been killing each other long before Hollywood was around,sometimes mankind can be worse than animals to each other and over and over again. A song by Molly Hatchett \\"Fall of the Peacemakers\\".I'm also dissapointed in Steven Spielberg-he pimped his wife out in a movie \\"It's a Girl Thing\\"-she looked like she enjoyed it though!
B000066I6N|4.0|The song Darkness, Darkness has to be one of the greatest songs that I've heard in quite awhile!  Plant's rendition is flawless.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is best put at unforgettable. You get pulled into this novel and feel as though you are reading about Scout mature and grow-up, you are grwoing up and maturing with her.  Harper Lee paints a very vivid picture of the South, all the while including a moral dilemma as well. I think that this book shows that you should never give up hope and you should always fight for what you belive in even if the odds are against you.
B000002BYD|5.0|That's right. Not hard rock or grunge, ROCK! Well, it may have a little grunge mixed in with it. I am not going to go through all the songs like I usually do because they are all perfect......EXCEPT for Red Dot. That track, sad to say, is horrible! At first my favorite was Brain Of J. until I found Wishlist and Given To Fly. Those because my favorites for a long time. THEN I found Do The Evolution! This song is a perfect representation of Pearl Jam. Good rock guitars, screaming vocals from Eddie and good old grunge sounding drums. If I had to rate all the Pearl Jam albums from best to worst, this would be second best, Vs. being the first best.<br />If you are intrested at all in more of Pearl Jam's stuff, check out Ten and Binuraul. I would be a little shaky on Vitalogy because that album is VERY experimental. No Code seemed okay I guess. I don't own it but from the reviews I read, it sounds like an average Pearl Jam record. Overall, this is a great buy. If you like Grunge or Rock or any type of Grunge/Rock or whatever, get this! This is such a great CD!
B00003CXRM|4.0|FILM:  O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a great comedy set in the dust bowl-era Mississippi starring George Clooney. The film really captures a unique and timeless feeling and combines that with a great plot and heaps of humor. This movie is a somewhat-unknown wonder that is steadily rising in popularity- rightfully! I liked this quality movie with great acting and direction so much that I bought it on DVD after renting it. I would give this four and a half stars if possible.<BR>SPECIAL FEATURES:  The special features on this DVD are disappointing, the only one that stands out being &quot;Painting with Pixels&quot;, a suprisingly interesting look at how Mississippi was changed from looking deep green in the summer to dry, barren dust bowl-era autumn. Everything else is very average, and the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; segment borders on boring.
B000067CPX|5.0|BEWARE! If you are a fan of the old RHCP, you may not like this album. For me, I was a fan since Californication. That was a great album but this is a more mellow, soft attempt to catch new fans. This album only has about 2 or 4 fast funky songs and the rest are pretty mellow and soft or are ballads.<br />In a way, this is a brand new RHCP. They are still as talented as ever and write good songs. Songs like By The Way and Can't Stop have funk to them and they sound very cool. ANOTHER BEWARE. If you think just the title track is good and you think the whole album is gonna sound like that, WELL you are very wrong. Just don't judge it by it's first track or listen. It gets better everytime you listen to it too.<br />Songs like This Is The Place and Dosed are AWESOME! The bass is prominent in the beginning and the vocals are awesome as ever. Venice Queen is another one of those AWESOME tracks. In the middle of the song, it has this WICKED acoustic guitar riff in it. I just can't get over it either. I also can't get over on how good the bass is in Dosed.<br />Can't Stop is another funky song with an AWESOME guitar riff when it gets into the song like 25 seconds of it. I can't get over that either. This album is too good. If you pass this up, and you buy it later in life, you may be very dissapointed or happy. <br />The vocals are better than their previous albums because they sound smoother and flow very well with the song. The guitar is not as prominent as it was in their past works. Flea's bass is still really awesome but no more of the &quot;slap bass&quot;. Chad's drumming makes the songs soothing and relaxing with his soft, rhymithic drumming patterns.<br />This is a really good CD! You cannot pass this one up! Its so good that its my top CD for the year for me. The best buy for CDs this year goes to this album also. You must buy this album. It gives your collection such a big boost!
B00005JL3A|5.0|I've never played the game and the truth is I saw this film because another movie,I can't remember which, was sold out, but that said I loved resident evil. I am a bit partial to both Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez, so let me be honest it would have been good at the very least for having those two stars, but that's not why I loved it. I've been a hardcore horror movie fan for years  and this movie simply had everything; A simple plot that took the viewer straight into gory action; a clean kubrick-like look and plenty of chilling splatterpunk mayhem. I was spellbound  from beginning to end. the last movie that made me feel that way was Reanimator. I never saw the cube so that seen with the laser just seemed very unique and who cares if the monsters were just zombies.<BR>I am looking very foward to the sequel more so then both star wars and the lord of the rings.<BR>See it you'll like it alot!
6305169187|5.0|Total complete fun from beginning to end! Bruce Willis is at his best in this movie. If you have not seen this movie, you should. So come on. What are you waiting for? There's even a bonus feature at the end of this movie. It includes: Aerosmith's Award-winnig Music video: &quot;I Don't Want To Miss A Thing&quot;. So watch it all the way through. It's excellent and fun! But, think before letting the kids see it though.<br />Rating: PG-13 for Language and Violence.<BR>Running Time: 151 Minutes
B000002VSN|4.0|Since her career started in the mid 80's, Whitney Houston dominated in true R&amp;B form, a form that has kept her going for several years. Surprisingly, almost nobody remained familiar with Whitney's roots in music.<br />When Whitney Houston starred in The Preacher's Wife in 1996, she showcased a true display of force dominance and honesty with her music. To be honest, the music was the most exciting music of Whitney's career in the movies, even better than the 1992 movie, The Bodyguard.<br />While many people still don't label Gospel as a kind of force in music on the radio these days, the music Whitney Houston has shown on this album, is a great starter into Gospel music. The songs here are beautiful, from I Believe In You And Me, a cover from The Four Tops, to Step By Step, written by Annie Lennox of the Eurythmics.<br />Although many people don't consider labeling Whitney Houston in the field of Gospel music, the music from The Preacher's Wife is about as good as it gets, from a category of music that still is heavily ignored.
B00003CXTF|5.0|This movie is one of the best movie in the world! It's scary and very sad. But, i'm sure every family member in your family will enjoy it. But it's not &quot;R&quot;.

B00005A46T|5.0|Now really, can you honestly call Slipknot nu-metal?  Sure, even nu-metal has its good points (bands like Tool and Coal Chamber are Stereomud indeed), but Slipknot has none of the so-so qualities that make nu-metal.  Let's face it:  the nine-headed monster from Iowa is called nu-metal simply because they're (relatively) new.  But if you listen to their composition, you will find nothing but thrash in the style of the best Slayer, Pantera and Sepultura.  Their first album, while still great and still thrash, was a bit sloppily done, and the musical ingenuity only shone out now and then.  Iowa is beyond improvement:  it is transformation!  A brief intro that's worth sitting through, followed by a brutal and brilliantly composed People=S***, then a good but exhausting trip in Disasterpiece.  The next song, My Plague, is very melodic and downright enchanting.  Everything Ends is a piece of (censored); skip it.  But the Heretic Anthem is quite an admirable piece of heaviness.  Gently (ironically named) simply engulfs you as the strength builds.  Left Behind is a bit commercial, but still a pleasing song.  Shape is a bit harder to get into, but you will really appreciate it in the end.  I am Hated is simply mesmerizing.  Skin Ticket is garbage.  New Abortion deserves a fair warning:  you might not survive (it rocks).  Metabolic is a bit of filler.  The title track is worth having, but a bit of an endurance test.  These sadomasochistic maniacs show just how versatile thrash still is.  Too bad they cut down on sampling and turntabling, but that's not such a big loss.  Neither nu-metal nor death metal, Slipknot have a lot to contribute to the metal world.
B000067CQK|4.0|This 2-cd set of Bowie's classic 1972 release is nicely packaged with a 40 page booklet of rare photos, info.,etc. in a gatefold hard case. The first cd is the complete remastered album. The second disc has outakes, remixes, and some unreleased tracks. I have to agree with one other reviewer in that this is an overpriced 2 cd set that could have easily been one cd. Again, this is another attempt by a record label to squeeze every nickel they can out of consumers. Bowie's classic \\"The Rise & Fall Of Ziggy Stardust\\" album clearly demonstrates Bowie's fascination with aliens, spaceships, etc. Bowie's songwriting has always been his strong point as is the case with this cd. Certainly no one can deny Bowie was ahead of his time back in 1972 when rock groups like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and art rock bands such as The Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer were what the public were listening too. Perhaps Bowie's music was too futuristic and radio stations seemed reluctant to play his music in heavy rotation. Rykodisc also released a limited edition version of this album about 12 years ago which included a rather lengthy booklet containing alot of intersting info. on Bowie at a much lower price. The Rykodisc special edition also had extra bonus tracks (as did many of the Rykodisc versions of Bowie's albums). Those lucky enough to have picked that version up will no doubt pass on this 30th Anniversary collection. For the most part this collection is really for die hard Bowie collectors. The regular remastered album version should suffice for most buyers. Highly Recommened for disc one!

I knew similar music, similar friends and experiences, the exploration of endless books, and a scant few mentors who let me know that being \\"gifted\\" doesn't make one a freak.<BR>The way the author pieces words together, and the way he follows Charlie's thoughts and observations feels very genuine and real.<BR>He was not afraid to deal with the most sensitive and intimate issues and did so with an innocent straightforwardness that is refreshing among today's literature.<BR>Just go get it right now and read it. You won't be sorry.
B00005JL3A|3.0|...well I haven't yet and I don't think any of you have either.  This movie is only a small facet of a complex and entertaining genre.  If Resident Evil the Movie is the only exposure to it you have had, I pity you.  When judged individually as cinematic creation, I think this movie fails in a number of fields.  However, if you consider just the content of this movie, it does contribute vital material to the RE universe that all of us non-T-virus infected individuals can extrapolate into our own little Raccoon Cities.  For example, I think Milla's character COULD be a very good addition to the RE cast. It seemed to me she had some depth that Jovovich herself, fans, or writers could have some fun with in the future.  That's one of the neat things about having enough electricity in the ol' melon, even if something (like a mediocre movie) isn't totally enthralling by itself, we can find something interesting WITHIN it.  <br />I found interesting things in RE the Movie and I thought it was worthwhile to see it.  If you are a true Biohazard (they really should have kept that) fan, then I don't need to give you any input about buying the DVD...I hope you already have.  If you have not had much exposure to the RE universe then I recommend spending a few dark, lonely nights with the games or Stephani D. Perry's excellent novels.  Build a Biohazard backbone before you buy RETM, then it will be worth owning...
0767906543|2.0|I put this book away a dozen times during the first 100 pages because it was iritatingly predictable and I found everything ordinary.  Worst of all, as ordinary as it was, it was still hard to believe some parts and dialogue.  Unfortunately, I was on a long road trip and this book was all I had.  So I trudged forward and found a couple interesting scenes (Meena's wedding) but was happy to finish the book and be done with it.  <br />I bought the book because people compared it to Hornby's High Fidelity.  I've read High Fidelity and About a Boy from Hornby and I can tell you that this book isn't worthy of the comparison.
0671646788|5.0|Simple actionable advice for self-improvement.  Basically, we are what we think, so think big.<br />1) Build confidence in yourself.  Action reduces fear, so act.<BR>Take small steps at first: Sit in the front everywhere you go, practice eye contact, walk 25% faster, practice speaking up,  smile big, use positve words. <br />2) Think and dream creatively.  Believe that it can be done and then the mind finds a way to get it done.  Be open to new ideas and be progressive. Stimulate yourself with diverse ideas from diverse people.  Capacity is a state of mind. <br />3) You are what you think.  \\"The price tag you put on yourself, is probably the same price tag that the world will put on you.\\" (pg 75)  Dress up.  Think your work is important.  Think enthusiastically.  Ask yourself if you are the type of manager that a subordinate would respect and follow?<br />4) Manage your environment because it is food for your mind.  <BR>People who tell you that it cannot be done are usually unsuccessful people.  <br />5) Make your attitudes your allies.  Live it up.  Broadcast good news.  Do better work that others expect.   Remember people's names.  Take initiative to build friendships.  Talk less.  Listen.  <br />6) Get the action habit.  Nothing happens just by thinking.  Do not worry about problems.  You can handle them as they come. Successful people handle problems as they arise.  You cannot buy insurance on all problems.  Start now. <br />7) Turn defeat into victory.  Defeat is a state of mind.  Be constructively self-critical; do not just look for another reason that you are a loser.  Think that there IS A WAY.  If it does not work, then back off and start afresh.   Get mentally refreshed.  <br />8) Use goals to help you grow.  Goal is a dream acted upon.  \\"The important thing is not where you were or where you are but where you want to get.\\" (pg 195) Know where you want to go.  Visualize your future.  <br />9) How to think like a leader.  Achieving success requires the helpof others.  Trade minds with the people you want to influence.  \\"What would I think if I were that person?\\"  Be human, and put people first. <br />The last words of the book, sum up its meaning:<BR>\\"A wise man will be master of His Mind.  A Fool will be Its Slave.\\"
B000002J0B|2.0|What's up, playaz??  <br />In my opinion, this band just doesn't make the grade, and I think their time is limited.  Save for the excellent and frantic opening tune, \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" this album basically goes nowhere fast.  I mean, listen to the extremely boring second song, \\"The Rain Song,\\" and you'll see what I mean!  I almost fell asleep, and I almost never sleep!!<br />But anyway, I'm just not feeling the vibe with these guys, not like when I listen to The Scorpians and Whitesnake.  Speaking of Whitesnake, I think these guys are a spitting image of that band, and that they've [copied] a lot of Whitesnake material, especially the singer, who is totally a David Coverdale [imitator].  Listen to his vocals and I'm sure you'll agree!!  Also, the guitarist plays way too dramatically, while the drummer sounds like he just rolled out of bed and started to play in a real groggy fog.  <br />To sum it all up, these guys are a bunch of 80's heavy metal [singers].  I don't predict much of a future for any of them.  On the positive side, though, there's still good rock out there, like Korn 'n Bizkit, not to mention the famed Slayer.<br />I'll talk to you later!!<br />PEACE OUT!
0140042520|2.0|One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes.

Everyone else pales compare to her in voice quality, you can say whatever you want about her as a person but Whitney's voice is a universal treasure that matches her beauty.

0790729644|4.0|Any movie starring Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris has got to be good.  But I must admit upon first viewing of this movie I was initially a bit let down.  As I watched I had trouble coming to terms with my childhood western hero Clint Eastwood being an old broken down, retired killer that couldn't even mount his own horse.  The plot is the normal revenge plot in two different ways. <br />First, the aging killers (Eastwood & Freeman) team up with a young kid who is all talk to collect a bounty on two cowboys that cut up a local woman of the night.  But when Ned (Freeman) loses the stomach for the killing he rides away.  And his caught by the Sheriff Little Bill (Hackman) and beat to death.  Upon hearing this news William Money (Eastwood) decides that it is time to get drunk and revert to the his old ways.  <br />It is here where we see the Clint Eastwood of old and the revenge style, lone wolf, western movie that made his career as he takes his revent on Little Bill and the town.  <br />The movie picked up pace about mid way and my initial let down faded fast as I realized where the movie was heading and the fact that the beginning was needed to set up the great ending.  Once again Clint has turned in a classic western. <br />The characters portrayed in this movie feel very real.  You can connect with them and sympathize with them, even when they are killing folks or being killed.  <br />A great movie and classic western!
B000001C6M|4.0|Show No Mercy, Slayer's debut effort, is a great album.  While they would make better ones, this still stands as one of the best debuts ever.  The only complaints I have are with the lacking production and sloppiness of some of the guitars.<br />This album features some geniune classics, like The Antichrist and Die By the Sword.  What I don't get is why no seems to comment on Tormentor or The Final Command, which are two of my favorite Slayer songs.<br />Slayer would go on too make faster and more complex music, but don't think this is bad because it isn't as fast or complex as those other albums.  It is excellant, and a nice album for those wanting to get into the band to start out with.
6302814359|1.0|RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD 2 is a horrible film! The plot is uninspired. The acting is horrid. Worst of all, the zombies and their makeup are laughable by most standards. Even by B-Movie standards, the film and all involved are horrible! Save your money and don't buy this atrocious picture.<br />The film takes place in small-town America where a cannister was dropped off a truck. In it, it contains a dead body and a chemical that raises the dead. The cannister is opened, unleashing the gas and the dead from their graves. The zombies act like some living people and the makeup is very poor. Not very scary at all. <br />I rarely find a film as horrible as this one. However, if you enjoy horribly acted B-movies with Don Johnsonlike zombies, you'll enjoy this. If you want a decent film, look elsewhere. Please, for the love of the B-movie, save your money and don't buy the horrible RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II.
B000001ELL|3.0|&quot;Dynasty isn't a BAD album. Personally I don't feel there is a bad KISS album that exists today. To own a kiss album is like owning a personal piece of rock and roll history. 30 years is a long time for a band to stick around despite the changes of the group's lineup. I've been a KISS fan since day one. They were the band that I listened to  when I was in high school and my parents just didn't understand.I think that Dynasty was just a real rough time for the guys, but despite the fact, it was released and is now a true collector's item which I feel is certainly worthy of adding to one's personal collection. I've  been collecting the &quot;rematered&quot; series since  the day I heard about them being realeased. I truly feel that the remasters are worth the time to find and buy. As I said, there are no bad KISS albums out there and all are worthy of collecting. Yes, the makeup, the costumes, and the concerts are now history but the name &quot;KISS&quot;<BR> will contine to live on in the hearts and minds of true diehard kiss fans everywhere and the band that the fans know as &quot;KISS&quot; will always be a permenant part of Rock and Roll History... From: misterd61/KISS Fan <BR>(from the beginning)
B000002B2X|5.0|This is a short but excellent CD.  I think it's a must have for any Alice In Chains fan; and definitely worth a listen if you appreciate good rock music.  Layne's voice, mixed with Jerry's voice, Ann Wilson from Heart, and Chris Cornell from Soundgarden all gel creating an unforgettable masterpiece.  5 stars for sure!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I love this film! I've never seen a film like this in my life and I'm only 21! I love the songs, the acting, the storyline and the people in the film. It has everything a classic film should have! Love, hurt, anger, a great cast, a wonderful storyline and Nicole and Ewan. No other film could beat this classic sweet love story...not ever Titanic! <BR>It will forever be in my heart and it wil forever be the greatest film ever made!
B00005N5S5|4.0|There are too many parallels between Schwarzenegger's automaton and Yul Brenner's robot cowboy in Michael Crichton's &quot;Westworld&quot; but you'll probably overlook them.  &quot;The Terminator&quot; is James Cameron's best film overall and original in its own right.  Hamilton, Biehn and Arnold all deliver electrifying performances, in this powerful, 1980's action film.  A must-have!
0316666343|5.0|What a concept, although it reminded me a little of Being Dead by Jim Crace.  I could not put this book down...I started it Saturday morning and finished Sunday afternoon.  I found it interesting that we can explore Susie's wants and desires - the \\"never got to...\\" from her perspective; and we got to see the dynamics of a victims family after the crime (much like The Deep End of the Ocean)...I liked the way things were left almost unresolved.  I will be passing this book around to friends and suggesting it for an up coming book group meeting.
0064407667|5.0|Wow.  I can not say enough of these unfortunate novellas, a word which here means short books for children.  I started reading these books while anxiously waiting for the next Harry Potter book to be released, a word which here means finished and published, and I read all eight books in a week and the unauthorized autobiography and couldn't put them down.  The unique and \\"old\\" style of writing make these books a very interesting read and the terrible villian, Count Olaf, the brilliant children, and the unfortunate events make them a pleasure to read.  If you have any sense, you will buy them and read them, and enjoy them... (I am going to die waiting until October for book the ninth!)
B00004XMTH|5.0|I'm pretty sure seeing it live is much much better,but for a person like me who lives too far and can't afford to go this is the closest I'll ever get to seeing a broadway musical.I absolutely loved all the songs and all the actors were great.My favorites being Rum Tum Tugger and Mr.Mistofolees.Jacob Brent is a great dancer.It may not be the best movie in the world and some may hate it,but you should definitely give it a try.I was a bit skeptical at first but ended up loving it.It's just the kind of musical that puts me in a good mood.So go ahead and maybe you'll enjoy it as much as i do.
B000002TQV|5.0|Best of the bunch. If you haven't bought this album and you like other Radiohead material; you have to get this one!  Better than all the rest.
0790729725|2.0|Not much can be written about this classic of the wiseguy genre that hasn't been written or said before.  When I recently decided that it was time to begin building my DVD collection, there was no doubt in my mind that Goodfellas would hold a place of honor between \\"The Godfather DVD Collection\\" and \\"The Sopranos\\"; a thought that was sound in theory, but premature in execution.<br />This DVD release and its cheesy cardboard snap case could hardly hold a place on the [inexpensive]  shelf at your local video store.  The box said \\"Soundtrack Remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1\\", my ears said stereo.<br />Half way through the movie I found myself looking at the interactive menu.  Puzzled, I popped out the DVD and looked for some defect that might have caused the DVD to return to the menu at this point.  Upon brief inspection, I discovered that the disk is TWO SIDED!  You watch half the movie, and then have to flip the darned thing over!<br />A film of this caliber deserves a much better DVD release.  My recommendation:  Don't buy this DVD release!  Eventually somebody, somwhere, will get off the stick and issue a DVD release that is worthy of this film.
B00003CXXO|2.0|The thought behind A.I. :Artificial Intelligence was interesting, but the plot could have been better.  I have basically two complaints about the movie.  First, it's very idea was incredibly insulting to children.  The movie made it out like children are just their parent's dolls, to be purchased and sent back.  Second, the entire movie was ruined by the arena scene.  In my opinion, no one should watch this movie, because that scene will stick in your mind and haunt you for days.  After reading this, if you still want to see it, hey that's your business.  But if you have kids, under no circumstances should you let them watch A.I. :Artificial Intelligence.  If they have to watch it, at least do not let them watch the arena scene.<BR>    I give this movie two stars, because of Steven Spielberg's directing and Haley Joel Osment's acting.  (Which were both phenomenal, as always.)
B000002UAR|5.0|This is one of my favorite Beatles albums. Actually, this is one of my fave albums PERIOD.When I first got it (for Xmas) I thought it was really weird and I didn't care for it, but after about 3 or 4 listens I liked it. I like pretty much all of the songs on this album. The only ones I don't like are Eleanor Rigby (great violins, but a bit overrated and very depressing), and For No One (okay lyrics, kind of boring).I'm not that wild about Yellow Submarine either, although ironically it was the only song I had heard of on this album when i got it. And Your Bird Can Sing & Doctor Robert are hilarious . The lyrics on the former are especially funny (\\"And your bird can swing\\", \\"when your bird is broken\\" those phrases always crack me up!) Love You To is pretty cool too. I really like the sitar. I also like She Said She Said. The 4 songs I just said and I'm Only Sleeping are my favorites. Buy this Album!
B00005R2M3|3.0|I am an avid follower of Shakira's music, and I was very excited about the release of this new album. However, she seems distracted by the english and spends more time worrying about making the words rhyme and things of that sort, that the music suffers.  I listen to the spanish albums constantly (donde estan los ladrones?, and pies desclavos), but this one makes it to the cd player much less frequently.
B000001GXI|5.0|I bought this set for only one reason, Fritz Wunderlich, no one can compare with this Tamino, Wunderlich's voice, is like the sound from heaven. Today, everyone is talking about the Three Tenors, but none of them could match with Wunderlich.  Although this is a 1964 recording, please don't indulge in today's digital technology, just hear the masterful performance of the great singers in this recording and you will know the difference.  Those who like Magic Flute should also try the recording (EMI Angel) by Otto Klemperer with Lucia Popp as Queen of the night, her performace is breath taking.

0679805273|5.0|This book contains a very powerful inspirational message for children and adults alike. It contains great wisdom about the trials and tribulations of life with a powerful message of life.<br />It contains a warning that we all need to heed: Except when you don't. Because sometimes you won't'<br />Something we all have to accept and deal with. Always at the basis is a very powerful message of hope :<br />\\"Kid , you'll move mountains\\". Unlike \\"Solla Sollew\\" , Dr Seuss acknowledges in this  book that sometimes when all the options are unattractive we need to head right out of town.<br />And how right he is.<br />And as in all of Dr Seuss' remarkable books , it is filled with the most beautiful , dreamlike illustrations.<br />A must read for every child and adult!
B000001EL3|3.0|I am not a Kiss fan I Do Own this and other two albums by them. The Thing though with this album is they decided to experiment a little. This album is pretty good and I think kiss fans love it but for me as a regular music fan ( im not trying to offend anybody) this album is just an average. this is cleverly produced album with a great cover and art design. it is a 9 song LP filled with rocknroll guitars and voices mixed with some strings and choirs ( the producer wanted it). this album was a good marketing for Kiss and international supestars. I dont hate them but for me as a regular music fans their albums a more entertaining than being called exactly masterpieces. which i fine in some cases. Cause I doubt it they wanted to be spiritulized and have something very important to say. But listening to the lyrics of the LP it is understandably why so many kids in mid 70s went out and bought the LP. So If you are a Kiss fan this is probably yours already. If you are not a Kiss fan but you want to be I probably will recomend this for you or Rock and Roll over to start with but I am no expert so you could get another opinion but for me this album is not a big masterpiece but it is entertaining and nice to have in your collection if you would like to have some rocknroll that you dont have to think or talk about later on.
B0000640VO|4.0|I really enjoyed Amelie. It was a fun sweet romance movie with a few twists. Compared to the standard Hollywood pacing, it feels a bit slow and plodding in some spots, but the quirkiness of the side plots help keep the entertainment coming. This film though about the modern world of real people is full of fantastic little touches made possible with great cinematography and rich special effects. <br />My only complaint isn't about the movie itself, but about the DVD. The DVD is in French, with the option to have English and Spanish subtitles. Loathe as I am sometimes to listen to overdubbed movies,I wish this DVD had the English overdub option. Reading the subtitles is a distraction from the beautiful filmwork and actors subtle visual performances. <br />I give the DVD 4 stars, and the movie itself, 5. It may not be for everyone (my wife slept most of the way through) but fans of foreign films and independent movies may greatly enjoy it.
B000000H57|5.0|One critic wrote that he was disappointed after hearing October Rust. (\\"Where is just 1 weakness??\\"). There is not much to add to that really. This is an album that makes you see and feel - invokes your imagination. Violent pagan sensuality... Beautiful humid autumn woods, full of magic and mysticism... druid celebrations... life, death, and sex... The album is melodical and elegant, mournful and intense. Cinnamon Girl continues TON's habit of making covers that stick more than the original. Burnt Flowers Fallen features another trademark - melodic, riveting keyboards over powerful guitar riffs. Haunted is amazing with its monumental organ structures and ecclesiastical feel. Pay attention to this \\"Product of Vinnland\\" - it's one of a kind.
078322334X|4.0|While it's no where near as good as The first, it's a classic compared to the third movie. Jeff Goldblum is fine as the lead (At least He does not embarrass himself Like Sam Neil does in the next film) and Peter Postlethwaite is fantastic as the big game hunter. All and All a good follow up to the original. <br />Word of advice, End Your Jurassic Park experience with this film and stay away from Jurassic Park 3. It's as bad as people have said.
B000000P11|5.0|I bought this album a number of years ago on Import [].<br />To think some lucky bastard will get it for less than []!<br />I bought it because they were from Manchester and they were frequently mentioned alongside great bands of the time like Joy Division, Echo, The Smiths and even U2.<br />This album for me is the sound of my suburban adolescence as much as Joy Division, Descendents' \\"Milo Goes To College\\" or Smashing Pumpkins' \\"Siamese Dream.\\" <br />This was one of the greatest post punk bands coming back for a third album in 1986, I believe, and they filled the thing to the brim with atmospheric guitar songs about childhood, and any number of universal every day ruminations. Some people think they tried too hard to be profound, but that sentiment is really a relic of the time it came out with many similar groups around- I had the fortune to hear it removed from it's original time and place, in the late 90s when really no band sounded like this. And I found it truly moving, and I don't say that too easily, believe it or not. This is a very unique and special album. <br />Swamp Thing is a highlight, yes, so is the great post-punk pop/rock of Mad Jack, the sing-a-long Childhood, Tears, Soul In Isolation, Seriocity, In Answer...I better stop, I'll end up naming every track.<br />For my money, this is pretty much the best the Chameleons ever got. That may be because I prefer the sentimental, poignant aspects of the music most.<br />If you've got everything by The Smiths, if you like post-punk music, atmospheric, guitar song oriented music of the 80s...whatever...BUY THIS ALBUM.
6300208699|1.0|This is one of those 60's films that assumes loud music, nudity,<BR>and obscene language to be hip.  However, all of these things at<BR>once are just boring, silly, and repetitive.  Skip it.
0316666343|4.0|Every year, usually in summer, there seems to appear a much heralded new book that everyone rushes to gush over and buy and it becomes a best seller and seems bound for the movies.  This summer's quirky winner is Alice Sebold's THE LOVELY BONES and while it rolls around the country gathering admirers it raises the question of \\"What will the book be a year from now?\\"  Sebold writes well and knows how to maintian interest in her characters, yet I think the main reason this little book is raising attentive eyebrows is its premise that Heaven is a place from which we can look down after death and follow all the paths less taken in life.  The beginning of the novel - a young girl's murder told in descriptive terms that border on maudlin - is a great attention grabber.  Can the dead Susie in Heaven help her disintegrating family rediscover each other as they cope with their loss and strive to find the murderer?  Once the setting is in place, what happens is entertaining to read but not wholly original or especially beautifully composed.  This is a good book, destined to increase the audience for this novelist's work, but the question arises as to her ability to find another gimmick for her next book. OR, does she really need one?  Only a year's time will provide us the answer. Not an Award Winner, but a terrific light read.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Cohen now preaches the Dharma, and he does it in the most ordinary, simple way possible. For those who can (and want to) hear, this album is manna. When I first heard &quot;A thousand kisses deep&quot; I burst into tears. I'm very grateful to have discovered this great work.
0767802624|4.0|This was a good movie when I saw it back in 1997.  It was fun to watch and you didn't have to think much about it.  When the sequel to this movie came out, I rented this movie again, I saw this as a masterpiece compared to the sequel out right now.  However just like Twister and Independence Day it hasn't aged well and gets on your nerves if you watch it more than once.  If you haven't seen it rent it not buy it because once is all you will ever need to see this movie.
B000062XM7|5.0|At first I was disappointed that this film veered so radically from the plot of Cooper's novel. Then, I realized that with a movie this well done it didn't matter a bit. Besides, the plot changes were necessary to make a movie, and oh well, few actually read Cooper anymore.<br />The acting is understated for such an epic, and all performances were great. However, the cinematography and above all the score stole the show for this movie. I HIGHLY recommend the soundtrack, which is remarkably seamless since it was done by 2 composers.<br />-best line: \\"Stay alive, no matter what occurs-I will find you\\"
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is pure entertainment at its best.  This was one of the greatest movies to come out of 1993.  It had action and the special effects were great.  The dinosaurs looked so real, I was really scared when I saw it in movie theatres.  If you want a movie you really want to enjoy then this is the movie for you.  The next two sequels proved to be far less entertaining and more boring than the original.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Lucas did not stint when it came to finally putting out a Star Wars DVD. If he had, the fans might have stoned him, after the wait; anyway, this DVD is sleek, with marvelous graphics and features you will keep discovering for a while. The movie itself is hard to review after having seen Episode II, but let's say it is a treat for the eyes and works very well as exposition for the entire Star Wars saga.
B00004RFFI|3.0|I used to like this movie when it came out in 1996.  I thought the special effects were good and the storyline was good.  As just in Independence Day, I found myself saying \\"Why Did I ever like this movie?\\"  When I watched it again I found that most of the twisters looked fake and the story was really bad. Although it was still fine watching it sometimes, I get annoyed by the characters and how they acted to his fiancee.  This was a movie of the times and does not age well as time passes.
