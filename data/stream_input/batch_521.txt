B000002MY3|5.0|After my review of the Acoustic version, I decided it was time I wrote a second, more important and longer review of my favourite album of all time, Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill.\\" I bought this album in early October 2002 when I was 15 years old. I look back fondly at the review I wrote on October 6th 2002 and now think about how special I thought this album was. I have since had to delete that review to submit this one. I was a little unsure of rock music at that stage, and wasn't quite sure what the devil I was writing about, but I gave it my best shot. Memories like this are very special to me, because in the 34 months since I wrote that review, I have grown up and become a man with this album. At the risk of sounding embarrassingly corny and nostalgic at the same time, it seems like a strange way to define my teenage years. Especially for a guy; to be so inspired by a female vocal album dealing with feminine issues from 10 years ago seems downright strange. Maybe my homosexuality has something to do with it, but I think the fact that this album has mass universal appeal is a more appropriate connection.<br /><br />So almost three years on and it seems like I've known this album all my life. It's a companion, it's a dear friend, and I relate to it more than any other album I've ever bought. I can only wonder what the next three years of listening will hold for me, and the three after that, and so on. I'm sure the range of emotions won't be as full-on, because the confusion of my teenage adolescence is all but gone, yet perhaps now I can listen contently and grow older with the album through life's many different tribulations.<br /><br />Looking back to 1995, I have tried many times to remember what I was like around the release of this album. I was only 8 years old, so the memories are few and far between. It wasn't until a year later in 1996 when the Spice Girls hit that I became interested in actually buying music and not just hearing it (not through choice) on the car radio. Sometimes I wish that Jagged Little Pill had been the album to get me interested in music, as it would've certainly been more credible in the present day than the Fab Five. So I completely missed Alanis' world domination through 1995 and 1996, boo-hoo, but I can still vaguely remember hearing the plodding thump of \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" on The New 96.3 Radio Aire, and wondering what funny lyrics that lady was singing! I might not remember much personally, but there's tons of stuff that you can know just from the notoriety of such a classic rock album.<br /><br />When the album was released on June 13th 1995, record label expectations were low. They expected the album to sell 250,000 at best. It entered The Billboard 200 at No.117, but within weeks had begun its swift accent up the charts where it would stay for a further two years (112 further weeks to be exact). The album was a steady seller. It was astonishing when the album had sold a couple of million copies just two months after its release. It sold by the absolute s***-load over the course of the next year, and by June 1996 had sold more than 10 million copies in America alone. There was simply no stopping Jagged Little Pill. It seemed every single angst-ridden teenage in the United States was the proud owner of this album, and by July 1998, the album had been certified 16x Platinum in America. The complete Billboard chart-run for Jagged Little Pill is as follows:<br /><br />[--117-90-43-30-14-10-7-7-3-3-3-3-3-3-1-1-2-3-2-3-4-3-4-6-6-6-7-6-3-3-3-3-3-2-1-2-2-1-1-1-2-1-1-1-2-3-5-3-2-4-2-3-3-4-2-3-2-2-2-2-1-1-1-4-4-5-4-3-8-6-5-8-13-14-14-16-11-9-9-10-12-15-21-24-29-32-29-29-37-42-42-41-49-58-68-66-67-67-79-73-83-81-85-94-87-84-90-81-95-97--].<br /><br />The success of the album was completely global. The United Kingdom had cottoned onto Alanis, and despite only one of the album's six singles making the UK Top 10 (Head Over Feet), the album was 1996's biggest seller, topping the charts foran unprecedented 21 weeks and selling close to 3 million copies. Even Madonna had not achieved album success like this in her career, and this was only a debut album from a relatively unknown. The success was repeated in countries such as Australia where the album became one of the few in history to shift more than a million copies. Eight million copies were sold in Europe alone and millions more in the Far East. Current sales stand around 30 million units worldwide, making it easily the most successful female debut album in the history of music. The fact that this album consistently remains in Amazon's Top 500 Best Selling Albums which is updated on a daily basis is a testament to its enduring popularity and appeal.<br /><br />I believe there are three main factors that contribute to the mammoth success of this pop culture staple of an album. The first is timing: the world was simply ready for a headstrong angry female. Alanis was all that and then some! Secondly, the vocals and lyrics go hand-in-hand as the perfect musical partnership. Thirdly, the melodies of every single song were so fresh and unique. Yes, the music was commercial, but it was great as well. Radio stations all over the planet played singles such as \\"Ironic,\\" \\"You Learn,\\" \\"You Oughta Know,\\" \\"Head Over Feet,\\" \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" and \\"All I Really Want\\" over and over and over until the point of complete saturation. This didn't do the sales of the album any harm, obviously.<br /><br />The melodies and vocal arrangements are the biggest strength of this album, and the main reason why I will listen to it for the rest of my life. The opener \\"All I Really Want\\" has a bold, striking harmonica that gets trapped in a driving guitar beat as Alanis questions, \\"Do I stress you out?\\" The lyrics sound absurd at first, slightly abstract, but very visual with images of splintered rulers cropping up. Yet over time, the lyrics become second nature, and the listener understands exactly the point Alanis is trying to get across. \\"You Oughta Know\\" was the album's first single and the reason that this album got noticed. The sight of the angst-ridden vixen trekking across the desert as she spat venom at an ex-lover is one of the greatest video moments of the Nineties. Four-letter expletives and odes to oral sex aside, the song is a rock anthem of grandeur proportion. \\"Perfect\\" became an anthem for teenagers who feel inadequate to the pressures of what it means to be 'perfect.' From Alanis' point of view, it's pushy parents, but for millions around the world it could have been any relative, or any friend at school. The emotion transcends the music as Alanis peaks, wailing, \\"Why are you crying?\\"<br /><br />\\"Hand In My Pocket\\" is a pop classic, defined by the complete sense of randomness and craziness. The image of Alanis breezing through life, despite the crap that it throws at us, and still coming out of it all smiling is something that the world smiled back at. An anthem that picks you up when you're down, this song will live on and on. \\"Right Through You\\" is the album's shortest song, but sure sticks in your mind as a strong rocker. The song is a bit heavier than anything else here, with guitars that really rock hard and drums that pound relentlessly in your brain. The lyrical content is quite meaningless, as Alanis sings about someone (a guy, presumably) who takes Alanis for a fool. \\"Forgiven\\" is a song that I absolutely adore and even used in one of my art projects about messages in words back in early 2003. This is one of the more serious song on the album as Alanis sings about religion and the deceit of the Church. Controversy aside, this song comes exactly halfway through the album, and is almost the centrepiece around which everything else swirls. This becomes all the more obvious as the third minute approaches, and the build up climbs and climbs until Alanis is screeching, \\"If I jump in this fountain, will I be forgiven?!\\"<br /><br />I sometimes sit in amazement at the way \\"You Learn\\" is composed. This is a pop masterpiece of a song, especially the last two minutes. The lyrics are random and sparse as they were three tracks previously, yet the melody is stronger and the vocal hook more memorable in my opinion. Alanis shines on this album as her personality breaks through to reveal a woman who is open and honest about her feelings and opinions on life. \\"Head Over Feet\\" is an amazing song which oozes simplicity, yet is complex and layered underneath the surface. This is reflected in the rather bland video, yet what is going on in Alanis' head as she sings to the camera is anyone's guess. The defining moment of the song comes, of course, as she sings \\"I couldn't help it, it's all your fault!\\" Here we perceive Alanis as selfish and childish, yet that's all part of the plan on the image created for this song. \\"Mary Jane\\" is the album's main ballad and seen by many to be the 'worst' song on the album. The guitar work is beautiful and melancholy as it seems to echo over a morning woodland sunrise and Alanis' primal vocals cut like a knife about the ambigious Mary Jane so depressed with life.<br /><br />\\"Ironic\\" is arguably the most popular song of Morissette's career, and in many ways always will be. The lyrics aren't actually ironic, as critics will be quick to tell you, but maybe that's the irony. Don't ya think? The flow of the song in the bridge is just beautiful. \\"Not The Doctor\\" is another favourite of mine, because of the imagery that the lyrics create. There's some clever word play at work here, and the chorus simply sways with seething anger. The three choruses gradually become more aggressive and snarling, especially at the point where Alanis sings, \\"...Sneak me in and oo-hhhhh!\\" The album closes with \\"Wake Up\\" which is absolutely brilliant and seems like a psychedelic trip overlooking the previous 11 songs. The lyrics don't really matter much here, because there's a sense of monumental achievement as the myriad of vocals rise and fall in the final minute.<br /><br />After that song finishes, there's a few minutes of silence before \\"Your House\\" begins playing. This hidden track became a fan-favourite and it's rather funny that it's one of the album's best moments. A completely acoustic track, Alanis sings a story about how she went to her lover's house and stumbled across a letter that gave away the fact that he was cheating on her. It doesn't sound very original, but the combination of progressive lyrics and powerful vocals make it positively chilling.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />So that's my review in full. Ever so sorry for gushing, but I was always going to do it at some point. People are just going to have to realise that Jagged Little Pill is one of a few albums that is praised so much because it actually deserves it. If you don't agree then fine, that's your opinion, but please don't try to take others down just because you don't agree with their opinion that it's the best album ever created. I don't believe that this album is the best album ever made, but it's certainly my *favourite* for so many reasons. I hope to introduce this album to many people over the course of the rest of my life, although I think it will have to be the next generation, as virtually everyone alive in this generation owns a copy! I feel almost blessed to have this album in my life, because it touches me on levels I couldn't have imagined. The intimacy is overwhelming, which is quite ironic from one of the most popular albums of all time. If you don't own this album, then you must buy a copy. You probably won't love it as much as I do (I don't think anyone does) but hopefully you'll get something out of it. If not then you can just marvel at this incredibly overblown review: the true sign of this album's worth in my eyes.t single and the reason that this album got noticed.

6304490119|4.0|This film managed to appear at just the right time.  Capitalizing on the success of the Star Wars films and The Abyss, and foreshadowing Independence Day, it manages to combine our dreams of instantaneous transmission across galactic space with a whole line of modern myths about the visitations of pyramid building aliens.  Hitting just at the right time, it spawned a successful TV series and lingers in the minds of more than a few avid film geeks.<br /><br />After a quick flashback to an old excavation in Egypt where a gigantic ring like artifact is discovered and then promptly whisked away into secrecy were come to the present and see Dr. Daniel Jackson (James Spader) getting laughed out of an academic conference for insisting that Cheops did not build the great pyramid.  Desolate, Jackson is recruited for a translation job.  Brought to some great subterranean base his challenge is to fine the right set of symbols on that ring, which turns out to be something special - a Stargate.<br /><br />Kurt Russell plays Jack O'Neil, a suicidally depressed Special Forces commando who will lead the team (Jackson included) through the Stargate when the combination is finally decoded.  Where they find themselves in a pyramid (no surprise there) on a desert planet where humans labor to mine the metal from which the Stargate was made.  This moment of mutual discovery is interrupted by the arrival of the villains in, sure enough, a giant flying pyramid.  A group of aliens took over human bodies millennia ago and has been living forever ever since.<br /><br />The film is predictable in the extreme - a feel good film with one of those spectacular endings where everything turns out right and the audience yells and whistles with delight.  In other words it's fun, but of the lightweight sort.  Acting is evenly forgettable, but survives having a cast the majority of which talk in an incomprehensible ancient Egyptian dialog.  Jaye Davidson gets a few extra points for making a pretty faced boy look totally evil, but don't look for much in the way of high drama.<br /><br />Still, I liked it then, and I like it now, especially the hokey Egyptian space furniture and animal headed costumes.  It's silliness in a good cause - something to shake a scepter at.  Don't get fooled too much by the 'Ultimate' thing.  You get a feature on Von Daniken, writer of Chariots of the Gods, and a narrative commentary, all easily skippable.faced boy look totally evil, but don't look for much in the way of high drama. <br /> <br />Still, I liked it then, and I like it now, especially the hokey Egyptian space furniture and animal headed costumes.

B00080ZG10|5.0|This film is phenomenal. Leonardo pulled off his best performance with a convincing portrayal of Howard Hughes. This era film of the 20's captured the essence of the time and causes the viewer to believe he or she is back in time with Mr. Hughes. Martin Scorsese deserves the title of best director for this film.
6304696566|4.0|The word masterpiece gets thrown around a lot. However, one measure of artistic greatness is the ability for a work of art to communicate different things to different people at different times. When viewed in this way, it is hard to imagine The Searchers as anything but a masterpiece.<br /><br /> I first saw this movie when I was about 13 or 14 years old on cable television. At that time, it seemed like a good western yarn set in Texas with John Wayne as the stereotypical protagonist riding off in the sunset, presumably, to kiss his horse. Indeed, Wayne has some awesome one-liners in this move. Phrases like \\"Not hardly\\" and \\"That'll be the day\\" are the ideological grandfathers of todays \\"Make my day, punk\\" or \\"I'll be back\\". As you may know (and other reviewers have pointed out), \\"That'll be the day\\" inspired the Buddy Holly song of the same name.<br /><br /> Years later, this viewer was able to see deeper meanings in this morality tale.  Ultimately, this tale is not about Ethan Edwards versus the Comanche. Rather, the true conflict is between Martin Pauley (Jeffrey Hunter) and Ethan Edwards (John Wayne).  While there are whole levels of analysis about the Indians and their role in society as portrayed in the movie, they are, on some level, merely the prop (the gizmo in the box) that create the reason for the conflict of wills between Ethan and Marty.<br /><br /> Who is Ethan Edwards? He is a character shrouded in mystery. Speaking fluent Comanche and possessing a deep understanding of their religion, culture, and lifestyle, he is for some unexplained reason filled with bitter, psychotic all-consuming hatred for all Indians, but especially Comanche. This is true even before they kill his brother's family and kidnap his two nieces. We learn this when Moses Harper talks about the Indians not missing Ethan while he was away during the Civil War. There is a strong emotional tension between Ethan and his brother's wife. One can clearly see the emotion in her eyes when Ethan returns from the Civil War and when she sends him off to take part in the hunt for rustlers/Indians who have stolen Jorgensen's cattle. Ethan seems to have an estranged relationship with his brother, offering to pay him for staying at his farm. One can only assume that Ethan had a relationship at some point with his brother's wife. Was Ethan at some point a captive of the Comanche? In that absence did the woman he loves marry his brother? Also, why did Ethan wait three years after the end of the Civil War to return home? Where did he get the large stockpile gold, unmarked and uncirculated \\"Yankee\\" gold coins? It is clear from his comments to the Reverend/Captain Clayton that Ethan considers the Civil War still ongoing and, indeed, when we first see Ethan, he is still wearing his uniform. Ethan further states that he doesn't believe in surrenders and he still feels his oath to the Confederacy still binding. Has he been fighting some sort of one man guerrilla war against the Union Army, attacking the wagon trains that supply the distant Forts in the West - they often had newly minted gold to pay soldiers? Did he return home because he was tired of fighting or does he intend to renew his relationship with his brother's wife? We will never know because within a day of his return home, his brother, his brother's wife, and nephew are killed by a Comanche raiding party. His two nieces are kidnapped, one dying shortly thereafter when she is presumably raped by the raiding party. Ethan becomes, if he wasn't already, obsessed with revenge. He sets out on a never ending quest to kill all Comanche to include, and especially, his niece who he believes will become more Indian then white and must be destroyed.<br /><br /> Marty (Jeffrey Hunter) is motivated by love. Love for his adopted family. Love for life. His only desire is to find his adopted sister and free her from the Indians. One reviewer described Marty as being reasonable, but in his own way he is as obsessed as Ethan. He turns down personal wealth, not once but twice, to stay with Ethan as they hunt for the girl. The first time is when Ethan offers to let him oversee his cattle and work with Jorgensen. The second is when Ethan offers to make him a beneficiary in his will tacitly recognizing that his niece, Marty's adopted sister, is dead. Additionally, Marty risks losing the love of his life by staying on this seemingly never ending quest. Jeffery Hunter looks like a little boy, perhaps baggy wardrobe helped a bit here, next to the swaggering Wayne. His inexperience and relative physical weakness cause one to wonder how he can hope to prevail in this unrelenting battle of wills. This story ends in a way which is guaranteed to touch your heart.<br /><br /> On a side note, while many reviewers have commented on image quality issues with this movie, this is the first time that Monument Valley was filmed in color. It is simply breath taking. This alone is worth the price of the DVD.<br /><br /> In conclusion, there are layer after layer of stories wrapped into this excellent film. Not only is this movie appropriate for the whole family, it has themes and sub-plots that mean almost anyone can find something to like.
B00027JYLC|1.0|scanned thru it once and threw it in the trash, poor story line (if it even had one) and not worthy of cult movie status. considering the age of the movie and the subject one would have to guess it would be either really interesting or very bad. sometimes you get lucky. this time i didn't.
B00004TXR2|5.0|Binaural (2000.), the Pearl Jam's sixth studio album<br /><br />The Pearl Jam were one of the great, if not the greatest rock acts of the 90's. From being part of the 'grunge' alternative rock explosion at first, the band were able to go off in their own direction by the end of the decade. By 2000, they were probably the only band from the grunge era to be still together, much to most people's amazement; not surprising, due to the band's withdrawal from the media spotlight. 'Binaural', the Pearl Jam's sixth studio album, released in 2000 is the capture of the great band entering the new millenium. 'Binaural' has proved to be the Pearl Jam's most criticised studio album, producing controversial opinions from reviewers and fans of the band alike. However, does this album really deserve its reputation as an ok but overly flat album?<br /><br />When I first bought 'Binaural', I was sceptical. I expected to like it but I reckoned that it wouldn't be in the league of 'Ten', 'Vs.', 'Yield' and 'No Code'. After a couple of listens to this album, I couldn't have been more wrong. 'Binaural' is one of those rare works, an album that sounds like no other, a disc that has a sound to it that's so unique whilst at the same time being unmistakably Pearl Jam. In fact, I would go as far to say that after 'Ten' and 'Yield', this album is next best in terms of greatness. Ok, the album overly lacks the aggression of 'Vs.' or the pure rockability of 'Yield' but it more than makes up for it in superb songwriting, diversity and atmospherics. That's not to say the album doesn't have its harder sometimes punk rocking moments like with 'Grievance' or 'Breakerfall' but on the whole the album is reflective and impacts on the senses in an undescribable fashion. Many people have dissed this album for the things I consider as plusses on the album. Many probably forget (non-fans who happen to own this album can be excused from this) that the Pearl Jam always look for a new direction every album and really this album, with its unique style, is one they had to make - fans especially must remember that this band have experimentation at their core. 'Binaural' is also the first Pearl Jam album to feature ex-Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, who replaced Jack Irons. Certainly a great addition to the band, some of the drumming, 'Grievance' is the song that comes to mind, is excellent. Furthermore, this is an album where the guitar work is much more subtle. McCready's guitar work may not be solo filled, but nevertheless the lower key but certainly adept guitar work works well with the album's style.<br /><br />To get things rolling, the album begins in rocking fashion, with the short 'Breakerfall'. The influence of the Who is definitely here in this one and that's no bad thing in this powered opener. Following this is another short song, the punk rocking 'God's Dice'. On a first listen this song didn't really do it for me, but over time I've appreciated it more; not quite classic Pearl Jam but I'll take it nonetheless! However, next up is a great song in 'Evacuation'. I found this one quite catchy; the drumming is powerful and this backdrops well to Vedder's howling chorus. Then we come to the longer more thoughtful stuff. 'Light Years' is a heartfelt lyrical offering from Vedder with some great but subtle guitar play. Similarly, the thoughtful theme continues with 'Nothing As It Seems', a more downbeat sounding song but with more atmospheric moments. 'Thin Air' is an acoustic gem with some more great lyrics and 'Insignificance', next up, has some sombre but compelling guitar melodies, and a superb crashing chorus. After this impressive passage, things get even better with the beautifully complex 'Of The Girl' with more hushed but striking vocals from Eddie Vedder and some luscious guitar work. Following this is the Grammy-nominated 'Grievance', a stunning track to say the least both lyrically and instrumentally. The pace of the track changes a few times but it worksmagnificently, especially where the drumming is concerned; a great protest song that only Vedder himself could pen. 'Rival' follows this; a step down from previous songs but still a good song, with an interesting growling dog opening. Then we have 'Sleight Of Hand', slow but atmospheric; a classic that builds but to great climax. 'Soon Forget' is an interesting interlude consisiting of Eddie Vedder and a ukelele. Its a poetic ramble that draws comparisons with The Who song 'Blue, Red and Grey'; again though I have no problems with the Pearl Jam being influenced by The Who. Then, to finish this great album we have the emotionally moving and striking 'Parting Ways'. Vedder's vocals are at their most reflective here and the song exit, using guitar and violins/cellos is heart-rendering.<br /><br />If you had to take the two albums which the Pearl Jam have made which have a difference of opinion right down the middle between fans, you have 'Vitalogy' and 'Binaural'. With the former I was on the sceptical side, enjoying a fair share of the album but being left disappointed by some moments, however with 'Binaural' I'm firmly in the positive. This album is a mellow but atmospheric and compelling stroke of genius. Eventhough this is up there with the best (in my opinion), I wouldn't recommend this album to a newbie to the Pearl Jam - that's what 'Yield' is for. However, any fan who appreciates the Pearl Jam's evolvoing and experimental edge should enjoy this album and appreciate its greatness. I'll not doubt that it needs a few listens to get into but nevertheless it is one hell of a masterpiece, just sadly an album that has become underrated and bashed by critics.ally where the drumming is concerned; a great protest song that only Vedder himself could pen. 'Rival' follows this; a step down from previous songs but still a good song, with an interesting growling dog opening. Then we have 'Sleight Of Hand', slow but atmospheric; a classic that builds but to great climax. 'Soon Forget' is an interesting interlude consisiting of Eddie Vedder and a ukelele. Its a poetic ramble that draws comparisons with The Who song 'Blue, Red and Grey'; again though I have no problems with the Pearl Jam being influenced by The Who. Then, to finish this great album we have the emotionally moving and striking 'Parting Ways'. Vedder's vocals are at their most reflective here and the song exit, using guitar and violins/cellos is heart-rendering.     If you had to take the two albums which the Pearl Jam have made which have a difference of opinion right down the middle between fans, you have 'Vitalogy' and 'Binaural'. With the former I was on the sceptical side, enjoying a fair share of the album but being left disappointed by some moments, however with 'Binaural' I'm firmly in the positive. This album is a mellow but atmospheric and compelling stroke of genius. Eventhough this is up there with the best (in my opinion), I wouldn't recommend this album to a newbie to the Pearl Jam - that's what 'Yield' is for. However, any fan who appreciates the Pearl Jam's evolvoing and experimental edge should enjoy this album and appreciate its greatness. I'll not doubt that it needs a few listens to get into but nevertheless it is one hell of a masterpiece, just sadly an album that has become underrated and bashed by critics.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|i saw the greendale live show before the CD came out and to tell the truth <br />i really only liked carmicheal and bandit live.... but after listening to the CD.. <br />this is a classic neil young record...maybe i didnt enjoy the show as much <br />because i didnt know the story beforehand... (like reading the playbill at <br />an opera...it gives a synopsis) <br /> <br />...very Zuma-ish.. very crazy horse..powderfinger comes to mind... if you like <br />this kind of neil.. you will love greendale... but the piece that makes this <br />5 stars is the acoustic DVD...after watching this and soaking up the details <br />of the story.. i love almost every song on this album...  esp. falling from above.. <br />grandpas interview.. only thing good on tv is Leave it to Beaver!  classic neil.. <br />similar to my softwares not compatible with you from without rings... <br /> <br />you will not regret purchasing this album... it is destined to be a neil classic <br />album which we will look back on with fondness...
B0009W5JS2|2.0|I remember the first XXX with Vin Diesel!!! Vin Diesel brought something to XXX, with the bad ass-fear nobody daredevil character, underworld feel-like the clubs and the russian gang/ terroist group, lots of action scenes with heavy metal blarring in the background!!! The original also had a more stable story and was put together, way better!!! Vin Diesel, was a way tougher XXX, than Ice Cube, face it!!! Damn, them for killing off Zhander (Vin Diesel)!!!      Now, for State of the Union, a pathetic excuse of a sequel!!! Does anybody remember \\"The Lost World\\", directed by Steven Spielberg, the horrible sequel to the original \\"Jurassic Park\\", which was visualy awesome, but still fell short and failed!!! This is a pretty the same scenario, they made \\"State of the Union\\" too ploty, and focused too much worring about the story and less on straight forward action!!!      At, the beginning you havethese teroist attack a secret NSA facilty, on a farm.... don't ask!!!So were meant to believe a bunch of terrroists were able to make it passed security without a trace, and slaughter the whole NSA facilty, without struggle!!!  Even, if the terroist was about 20 years advanced technolgy, the NSA would have lasted longer than only 5 minutes and would have better weapons, with way more advanced security along with commandos and probably government agents their too!!!     If, the NSA knows and can tell you every detail on terroists, and is called the National Security Agency, trusted in keeping America safe, why is it that thaey can't secure themselves!!! Anyways, Gibson and the gaget man are the only two that escape!!! NSA agent led by (Scott Speedman), cut operations and search for Gibson suspecting he had something to do with it!!!     Meanwhile, Gibson decides to call up a new XXX, a tougher one and Ice Cube being the choice!!! An ex soldiered court martialed for 20 years for disobeying and assaulting General Decker( the mastermind behind everything)!!! Gibson finally, convinces him to help him, they don't hae the best friendship in the world!!! Now they make it look easy to escape from fedral prision, as when the sniper has a shot and doesn't fire for some reason that is when I knew this was going to be a bad film!!! So they basically must figure out who is behind this and why, with a bunch of action scenes, and some sweet stunts!!! Gibson is supposely killed off easily, so the fate of the world lays on Ice Cube's shoulders!!!      Ice Cube may act tougher but Vin Diesl and his stunts from the first movie, blow anything that this movie has to offer!!!     Beyond that they replace, the heavy metal with ghetto music, and the story is shaky with ons and tons of plot holes and problems, with unexplained stuff so on and so forth!!! To sum it up Secretary of State Decker(William Defoe)/General Decker believes,that the goverment has grown weak and feels he must put the government back on track, by destroying the government, and bulding up their armies and such!!! He plans on assinating him during The State of the Union cermony!!!     So he  basically works out a plan, that requires the price of blood, he's pretty muuch one of those world domination/ fame nut cases using fancy words!!! Yeah and nobody finds out about this, either and who knows where he gets the funding for all this either!!! Ice Cube aided by Xibit and his \\"homies\\" go breaking through the secruity lines around the White House in tricked out vechiles, with weapons, which we are also supposed to believe!!! Then Ice Cube and Gibson team up and together must save the country once and for all!!!     Of course their are some great action scenes for example attacking The Aircraft carrier with a Bradley, but really how the hell am I supposed to believe that at all!!! Since the Abrams tank would have destroyed the Bradley instantly, playing us for a bunch of fools!!!     The last part with the fight on the Presidental Bullet Train was pretty darn cool as well!!! The thing is this whole time they keep playing us for fools: they make the NSA seem whimpy, along with the army, make it look easy to escape from a fedral prison, and in the meantime Decker schemes are never discovered, until it's too late!!! This movie basically makes us Americans look like fools!!! This movie is only good for raw action, their are some pretty sweet gagets as well, with cooler cars!!!     Hey, it's good to put a little imangination in the film, but besides that the movie is just weak the story is messed up and in all reality, the first XXX Zhander Kage(Vin Diesel) was 10,000 times better!!! Like, I said an sequel that fails to sastisfy, hopefully XXX 3 will be more like the first one, which was really good!!!     Overall, I will give this 2.5/5...... failed to please, very disspointing!!! Do not buy this get the original instead!!!
B000002JPA|4.0|Dream Theater's Images and Words, though not in the realm of my top five prog rock albums ever, is a very important album for the genre of progressive rock. All the music is well crafted and the energy on the album is great. The Dream Theater musicians take us through an exciting journey of shifting time signatures, brilliant rhythms, changing tempos, modulations, haunting melodies and mind blowing solos. John Petrucci's guitar work on this album is unbelievable especially on \\"Take the Time\\" and \\"Under a Glass Moon.\\" Kevin Moore's keyboard work is good, but I've liked Jordan Rudess's work better on DT's more contemporary albums. Even John Myung gets some exposure on \\"Metropolis- Part I.\\" Portnoy's pyrotechnic drumming is amazing as always. The thing I love about Portnoy is that he plays complex rhythms and does fills where he's hitting more drums per beat than one would conceive as humanly possible, but at the same time, everything he plays complements the music and is not used as a vehicle to show off his ability. The most amazing thing about this album is James LaBrie's vocal work. His tenor voice is unbelievable. His range is higher than some of the lowest singing women. His technique is flawless. I've had this album for two years and I still get chills hearing LaBrie soar up to the apex of his vocal range in \\"Learning to Live.\\" The only qualm I have about this album is \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Surronded\\" have a tendency to sound a little too poppy for my taste. The soprano saxophone on \\"Another Day\\" just kills the song and \\"Surronded\\" sounds a little like an 80's monster ballad at the beginning but starts to lean more towards prog deeper into the cut. These two songs are not by any means reasons to not buy this album but are just weak points of the album. All the other songs make this album a classic and several of them make up some of Dream Theater's best material. This album is a must have for any prog fan.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's story of life in Alabama in the mid-thirties is a  <br />marvelous work of art at its best.  Had seen the film, loved it, and am not sure how I missed reading the book until now. <br />But, at age 74, I am so happy to have corrected that omission. <br />My belated congratulations to Ms. Lee for telling a timeless story in an unforgettable manner. I consider it a book no serious reader should miss.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's \\"Barry Lyndon\\" is one of the most breathtaking experiences you'll ever encounter in cinema.  Every single frame breeds life, due to pioneering lenses Kubrick created to capture the essence of the story in natural lighting.  There is not one artifact that goes unappreciated in any frame of the film.  Kubrick is certainly a genius.  Award winning cinematography.  Candle light scenes.  Wonderful and award winning costumes.  Unhindered and convincing performances.  A haunting and moving score, which Kubrick selected personally.  1975 film was ignored at the box office, mainly due to it's length of 183 minutes, but every minute is gorgeous.  A moving painting set to music.  The remastered edition is a God sent.  The picture is crisp.  The sound spectacular.  Overall, \\"Barry Lyndon\\" is a perfect example of what can happen when a director succeds with an uncompromising vision.  Kubrick was a true pioneer, it's just a pity there will never be another Stanley Kubrick film.  To see the true beauty of Stanley Kubrick, is to see \\"Barry Lyndon.\\"  Enjoy.
0140177396|5.0|In this short story, Steinbeck describes the friendship of two very different men during a period of migrant farm work in early 20th century California.  This friendship is marked by a shared dream to buy a small plot and \\"live of the fat of the land\\".  The two characters could not be more distinct -- one, George, is a short wise man, with rugged and sharp features; the other, Lennie, is a large and strong man, gentle but with very limited wit.<br /><br />Steinbeck's description of characters and nature is very simple and clean, especially of the other farm workers in the farm where Lennie and George are just arriving.  It is a world of loners, like Candy who is injured and old but still looking for a place where he belongs, and Crooks who is a deformed black man who is ostracized by the other workers (and carries a lot of resentment for it) and buries himself in books.<br /><br />There are quite a few underlying themes in the story, most of which question the value of life and dreams, especially as one is getting old or one's dreams seem to be fading away in a second.  Lennie is caught in a situation where his great dream to tend rabbits in their land is shattered by an encounter with the wife of the farm owner's son that gets out of hand, and so the story unfolds to its tragic ending.<br /><br />The ending is exceptional, shoking and leaves one reconsidering the book for a while.  The most impressive characteristic of the ending is the lack of change in style; Steinbeck continues its clean and direct prose and is able to construe a believable and meaningful ending in just a few pages.<br /><br />I highly recommend this short novel, it is a little over 100 pages and you should be done with it in a 2-hour flight.  It is a great intro to Steinbeck's writing style, which, along with The Pearl, in my opinion, makes a great combination of Steinbeck's short tragic stories.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins is my favorite movie of all time.  I watched it 10 times in the theater and I am going to buy a big screen tv for the dvd.  Every young man should watch this movie as it features an all star father figure cast of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and the immortal Liam Neeson.  Watch as they mold an angry young man into a legend.  Not to be overlooked is rising star Cillian Murphy as he plays the creepy Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow.  After the disastrous Batman & Robin in 1997, this is the movie Batman fans have dreamed about for years.
B00005JN5X|2.0|I was initially intrigued by the possibilities of a plot combining an action movie with the tales of the Bros Grimm, but also had my reservations. Unfortunately, I did not listen to that little voice in my head and went to see this film.  What a big mistake and what a huge waste of time!  I was moved at several points to get up and leave the theater - in the end I wish I had.  A cohesive well laid out plot and compelling story line would really have been nice things to have!! And the sputtery, awkward acting was most likely a result of not really having anyone at the helm on this ship. Save your money on this one folks....Miss it!
B00000DLVA|5.0|This CD is so mysterious, beautiful, and strange. I concur that Sweden has the best bands in the world. Nina has such a well i don't know how to describe voice- childlike innocence yet dark? You just have to listen to this and experience top notch music.
B0000669JL|5.0|This is it, folks! The heart and soul of all things raggae.  <br />Bob Marley is the single biggest influence on everything from raggae to punk to ska. Everyone from the Clash, the Ramones, Rancid, U2, Johnny Cash, even Metallica, has cited Bob Marley as an influence on their music.  <br />Bob's music is especially remarkable because he managed to have the most positive of messages in all his songs in a very negative world. Whether that had anything to do with the fact that he was a notorious pot head isn't important. Marley was a devout Rastaferian, to such an extent that when informed he had cancer in one of his toes, he let nature take its hold without medical attension, becuase his religion wished it so. <br />His personal beliefs aside, Marley and the Wailers had made raggae univerally popular for the first time. <br />Legend perfectly sums up an incredable career, including all the songs nobody will ever forget. The new songs and packaging is all well and fine, the remastered version isn't really any different from the other one, but it's a good disc anyway, by far the best Marley comp out there. Amazing!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|While sitting through this movie and the bonus features on the DVD I couldn't help but feel that those making it were constatnly thinking, \\"We are SO cool because we can travel the globe and make movies overseas.\\" <br /> <br />The movie did have some beautiful shots of Tokyo but that was really about it. The story itself was very understated and simple and really never took off in my opinion. The story can be summed up by saying that two Americans unhappy with their relationships meet each other and then wander around Tokyo. Their wandering around takes them to karaoke bars, strip joints and sushi bars. That's it. Nothing beyond that really happens.
0393312836|5.0|This book's real horrorshow. All the violence, fun, and rape keeps me pumped up and full of life.  But then again, it makes me think about philosophy and good and evil, human nature and all that razdraz, at the same time.   <br /> <br />It's not like all those other books that portray all the stark realities of our fallen world, that makes u go all boo hoo hoo.  The strong bad in here is counteracted by the main Character's, Alex's, charm, wit, and his love of classical music.  This book makes u happy and think about free will and God and good and evil at the same time.  Whats interesting is that this book doesn't give an opinion, like all those other philosophical novels, instead, it asks all these questions and has no answers, but instead of leaving you confused, it makes you not care and instead, crave Alex's idea of fun. <br /> <br />when first reading, ull be confused because of the thick slang, but u understand it all in a little while if ur not dim witted. <br /> <br />And another thing: this book is for the mature minded who have self control.  I hate it when yooung people read things (those who normally dont read), just cuz it has all this \\"cool\\" violence in it and such, but then again, im like that myself a bit and so is everyone else.  Even if you arent' much of a book worm, read it, itll dispel your stupidity, and possibly make u wiser.   <br /> <br />To me, the theme of the story is this: if u are meek, unselfish, humble, and dying, u are great not in the world but in God's eyes, if you believe in a God in the first place.
6305537321|5.0|Last evening I saw \\"Breakfast At Tiffany's\\" on the big screen. The last time I saw it in a movie theatre I was...let's see-1961... I was  thirteen, an adolescent in Bethesda Maryland, at The Bethesda. I have viewed it on television, tape, own the DVD ,read the novel by Capote, knew the screenwriter George Axelrod and spoke to the director Blake Edwards at length about \\"Breakfast...\\"-I hope by now I have established my creditentials for reviewing this delightful film. Not only is Hepburn at the height of her beauty, she gives a remarkable performance creating one of the screens most memorable characters; Miss Holly Golightly. Much of the movie is shot in Manhattan and the city looks great (years later I moved to New York, probably because of the many New York films I saw as a teenager, that made it look so inviting) Mancini's score is brillant,it captures the spirit of the film completely. George Peppard is very good as the not quite fufilled Paul Varjak. Sparkling supporting performances by Martin Balsam and Pat Neal. \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", transports you to another time, a time of cigarette holders, narrow black ties worn with tweed jackets, the little black dress and a string  of pearls, a stunning woman in an oversized hat, sterling silver telephone dialers purchased from where else...Tiffanys. See it, read it, own the DVD, buy the soundtrack. It is, in Miss Golightly's words, \\"Simply devine\\".
B00070Q7VO|2.0|On the recommendation of a friend, I recently purchased the second CD, \\"It's Time,\\" of a young Canadian song stylist by the name of Michael Buble.  Having a rather eclectic musical taste I didn't expect much from the CD, certain my friend had over-hyped it.  Was I ever surprised!  This is, without doubt, the single best CD that I have ever purchased.   Buble's voice, his phrasing and the song selections on this CD make this a listening experience that should be shared with the world.  I hope for nothing but great success and continued production from this rising star.
1400032717|5.0|Wow. <br /> <br />I don't really know how else to describe the book.  It's definately nothing like any other book i've read. <br /> <br />I have to admit, even though I read all the great reviews on it I wasn't too convinced that it would be as good as what the reviews were saying. The plot just didn't seem too exciting.  <br /> <br />However, when I read the first page of the book I was immediately thrown into the story and wanted to continue reading.  So I bought the book..and (as cliche as this sounds, it's true) couldn't put it down!   <br /> <br />I honestly feel an attachment to the austic boy, Christopher, as though he is a real person that I know.  It still feels so real. <br /> <br />I was (and still am) surprised at how enticing this book was.  I think it wouldn't have been that good of a book if it were written as either a 1st person narrative or 3rd person narrative.  I think what made it the entire story and characters feel real was that the author made the book so that it were as though Christopher himself was the author. <br /> <br />Once again, <br /> <br />Wow.
B000068OSK|5.0|I love Randy Rhoads, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain and Dimebag (god rest their souls).  Jack White is the spirit of something similar, something different, at the right time, in the wrong place. How could music so simple have the same heaviness and soul-grabbing punch as our aforementioned heroes? Not to mention Metallica, System of a Down, U2, and Radiohead.   If Delta Blues was all this good, I was born too late.  Just listen to Jack. Brilliant blues and minimalist approach that makes anything else in rock seem bloated and over-produced.  I unfortunately worked backwards from discovery of this band on Elephant.  Shy of \\"the first album\\".  Once again, this band has surprised me.  The first album is more classic and brilliant than all the rest.  I  just saw Jack and Meg at Red Rocks.  Although the White Stripes have evolved experimentally since this album, the graceful blues and heavy riffs are untouched!
B0000074FB|5.0|This is pure genius, pure melodic hard rock, pure fantastic songwriting by the late, great Lynott. The guitar work is just sublime: listen to the solo in &quot;Dancing In The Moonlight&quot;, or to the gentle opening lick in the beatiful &quot;That Woman's Gonna Break Your Heart&quot;. The album also has its rockers, like the drum-pounding title track, &quot;Killer Without A Cause&quot; and &quot;Opium Trails&quot; which both have a Brian Robertson (now here's a true rock n' roller) signature riff. Phil Lynott graces the album with sublime lyrics, real poetry, just listen to the great &quot;Southbound&quot;. A real great rock album.
B000002P2W|5.0|Impressed with the service.  The goods arrived in good time and in good order.
B0000024ZI|5.0|That's a '70's rock jewel. Ian Hunter is one of the best songwriters of all time, and he sings fine, a cross between Bob Dylan and David Bowie. The Bowie-penned title track is an instant classic. It also has some cool rockers like &quot;One Of The Boys&quot; and &quot;Jerkin' Crokus&quot;, with great guitar work from the much-underrated Mick Ralphs. The opener, Dylan's &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; is just gracious, but the best song on this album is &quot;Sucker&quot;, which shows Hunter's immense talent as a songwriter. You really can't go wrong with this one
0743233832|5.0|The choice of reading this translation of Aurelius' \\"Meditations\\" was based purely on the reviews I read here at Amazon. Most people seemed to love Scot and David Hicks' translation, so I thought it would be worth trying it. That choice was, indeed, a very good one, so thanks to all the reviewers who raved about this translation!<br /><br />Unlike some translations of older works, this one does not have that dry feeling to the style, and the language is very modern and easy to flow through. It has to be said that the translation has been with done with a lot of consideration for the meaning of Aurelius as well as the sensitivities and preferences of the modern reader in terms of language and style. Overall, an excellent translation to get into and read.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's Handbook\\" is the first translation I have read of Marcus Aurelius' book, and I was surprised that Aurelius did not write it to be published. It is, rather, Aurelius' personal reflections and thoughts on life, himself and other things. His scope of topic matter is comprehensive, and the concise aphorisms give easily remembered ideas to think about yourself.<br /><br />The translators claim that you do not need to read it cover-to-cover, but can really start anywhere in the book. I tested this out, and they are right. I started reading in random places, and still got a good insight from the reading.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and I would say that if you are looking for a good translation of it, buy this one. The reviewers here before me were right: it is an excellent translation and a very, very useful book. Food for life, one might say.
B000002AGN|5.0|In 1971, as a cub reporter for my college newspaper, I was assigned to photograph a campus jazz event. I was a rock guy so I expected to be bored to tears.  Man was I wrong. The group ran a clinic, explaining jazz to the people my age in a simple, exciting musical lecture. When they played Take Five, I felt chills. At the end of the 2 hour session, I was hooked. I had to have more so my girlfriend went out and bought Brubeck's Time Out as an early birthday gift (vinyl, monaural). What a trip! Every tune is toe-tapping great. I played it until the grooves were worn out. When the CD world exploded, Time Out was an early purchase. If you are a long-time jazz fan, you probably already have this one. If you don't, get it now and you will not regret it. If you are not a jazz fan yet, make this your introduction to a new, truly American art form. Tired of the sad state of pop music? Then renew your interest with this classic. Easily one of the top 100 jazz recordings of all time.  On par with great recordings like \\"Kind of Blue\\" - you should have this CD on your shelf.
B00005JN5X|3.0|Ever get the feeling everyone in Hollywood is reading the same marketing trend analysis data and then digging around for something that kind-a-sort-a fits? After this movie I'd like to suggest, that even great actors and a great director can't make a movie solely based on a trend... it needs a plot too.<br /><br />Sure, the Brotherhood of the Wolf and Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow were brilliant. And , sure Van Helsing was uninspired, but entertaining. But, now we have the Brothers Grimm, a movie that's seemingly full of half efforts.<br /><br />Unlike Terry Gilliam's previous masterpieces Brazil and the 5th Element, it's as if the plot and special effects are all half baked and not nearly up to Gilliam's normal, incredible standards.<br /><br />Matt Daemon, who is supposed to be playing a con-artist with a heart of gold, never really comes across with the confidence to be a confidence man. The performance is completely lacking in Daemon's trademark sense of energy.<br /><br />Ledger tried valiantly to play a nerd, but there's the constant sense that we're waiting for him to take his glasses off and shake his long hair down, as many heroines, and an ever growing number of heroes, have been doing for decades.<br /><br />What is interesting is the setting. Someone has tried to weave a little French-German history, a little Wiccan-Diana propaganda and a little actual folklore into a movie.<br /><br />The film struggles to turn an interesting background and a couple dozen fairy-tale-based what-if's into an actual plot and sadly never quite makes it.<br /><br />I'm not saying fairy-tales based movies are a trend that's over, all I'm saying is even an interesting trend and a brilliant director can't sustain a movie with a mediocre plot.
B000002UAU|4.0|This was the first Beatles albums I ever brought & yes it just blew me away & although I have since got albums such as Revolver, The White Album, & Abbey Road which I admit are better efforts but no one can deny that Sgt Peppers is the best produced album of the 1960's, and one of the most clever & gutsy efforts of all time!!! <br /> <br />It also includes some of their best songs (Sgt Peppers, A little help from my friends, Lucy in the sky with diamonds, Gettin' Better, & When I'm sixty Four). Although there are some weaker efforts (Within you without you, Lovely Rita, & Good Morning) the album itself would scare the heck out of The Rolling Stones who in response would do (in a moment of madness) Her Majesty's Satanic Request, though they would return to form in Beggars Banquet!!! <br /> <br />To conclude if you want to hear an album that changed the way people thought about music & changed the face of the musical world then this is it. Sgt Peppers, yes the best produced album of its decade, the best music, ok maybe not, but at least it prooved that quality layers never quite made quality results, but Sgt Peppers is the nearest anyone has ever come!!!!
B000084T18|1.0|50 cent has to be the most over-exposed, over-promoted wack rapper in the history of Hip-Hop. I even feel uncorfortable using the term Hip-Hop and 50 cent in the same sentence, 'cause one has nothing to do with the other. This is a commercialized, studio gangster (sorry for the oxymoron) who's only gimmick is that he's been shot nine times and lived. So what? People get shot every day! 50 completely lacks MC skills and probably couldn't flow if his life depended on it. All he can rely on is image. A negative one, at that. Jail-house physique, tattoos and the most stereo-typical atittude to help enforce all the negative ones already in place. There's only ignorance, profanity and violence in each one of his wack-ass songs. This is not Hip-Hop, this is ignorant music at it's best. No creativity, no originality, no intellect, no substance, no nothing! Just pure garbage! Music for the feeble minded, mental midget. Could that be you? Hip-Hop is a \\"culture\\" not a \\"game\\". Open your third eye and seek music with substance that'll uplift your mind, body and soul. Don't let the media (video shows, radio, magazines) dictate what's Hip-Hop. Do the knowledge and free the dome. Don't be a slave to the ignorant sound-wave. Don't watch channel zero. Peace!
B000002UAF|5.0|Although without the experimental music of latter releases such as Revolver, Sgt Peppers, & Abbey Road, 1964's A Hard Days Night is The Beatles first classic album & also their first release where all the songs were penned solely by the band. Only originally released in the UK the album was based actually on the film of the same title, and around half of the songs are lifted from that film with the other half new releases (well then they were anyway!!!) <br /> <br />The album included the number 1 hit singles A Hard Days Night, & Can't buy me Love and also includes some other gems such as Any time at all, & I'll be back. The album is mainly filled with love songs and is very easy listening but has a very raw Poppy feel also. But there are also hints of country (I should have known better) Folk (If I feel) & blues (I'm happy just to dance with you). But The Beatles softness in tracks such as If I fell & And I love her, are perhaps the styles that most people remember them for!!!! <br /> <br />A Hard Days Night prooves to be a great listen, and is probably the easiest listening Beatles album & probably the most fun & uplifting album they did. Yes it is without all the fireworks of latter releases but The Beatles prooved that even when they were barely naked they were miles from the nearest competition of the time, or actually of any time!!!!!
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|First, I'd just like to say that System of a Down was once my favorite band.  When I got Toxicity, it was the most heavy and interesting thing I had ever listened to.  I decided to get their self-titled album, and liked it even more.  Ddevil and Sugar were so bouncy and fun and there wasn't a single song I disliked.  The band was just so good at making every song sound like a single.  If the band had stopped at these albums, I would remember them as one of the best bands of all time.  Unfortunately they decided to make Steal This Album, which I found to be devoid of their former artistic prowess.  It only had a couple of truly great songs.  I decided to just write that album off as a glitch and actually believed that Mezmerize would be a triumphant return for the band. I was wrong.  I can't even listen to BYOB without shedding a tear.  The only reason I can find for how they could fall so far is that they decided to get more of a pop sound to reach more people.  Either that, or they just lost their passion.  It's not hardcore, its not fun, and its not even very unique.  While the songs on the first two albums were masterpieces, these new ones just run together in mediocrity.  Serj's once bizarre vocals are now kind of toned down, and all of the songs sound neutered.  The lyrics, while they used to be mysterious and inspired, are pretty dumb now.  For me, its like watching the fall of Rome.  If you loved the heavy, dark, artistic vibe of old System, prepare to be disappointed.
B000002UAO|5.0|Then you'll love Rubber Soul!!! <br /> <br />Rubber Soul continues where A Hard Days Night left off, but only this time the production is more crisp and the songs don't just concentrate on love, relationships, break ups, & the hurt of breaking up. Rubber Soul also continues The Beatles habit of writing 3 minute or less classic Pop, & also their willingness to change without loosing their identity or originality!!!! <br /> <br />The album includes the hit songs Drive my Car, You won't see me, & Michelle. But if you think that The Beatles are just about the singles...well you ain't heard any of their albums. As theirs other gems such as Nowhere Man, Word, What Goes on, Wait, & Run for your Life. Rubber Soul like its predecessor A Hard days Night is a 30 plus minute chronicle of perfect Pop, or the most perfect Pop you're going to hear!!!! <br /> <br />So to conclude Rubber Soul is one of The Beatles best & although perhaps (well in my opinion) not as good as A Hard Days Night, it was definitely a sign of things to come (Revolver, Sgt Peppers) & is definitely on of their top releases. In truth you can't go wrong with a Beatles release & there's no way one can go wrong with Rubber Soul!!!!
0316234753|5.0|Some art books can make kids cry in frustration with, \\"I don't get it, I can't do it\\". I have never had that problem with books from this artist, kids just love these! Ed Emberly has made some wonderful books for kids and grown-ups of any age that have no drawing skills, but want to learn a simple way. His books are the easiest books to get you started if you have no previous drawing skills. He doesn't talk down to you, he doesn't talk at all but uses his step by step method for you to follow. As a result, you can use these books for kids that have language issues. He starts with a step by step illustrated lesson to draw one simple item. First a simple straight line here, then insert a circle then, then another line, step by step along the way and before you know it you have a completed drawing that you can be really proud of. I teach Cub Scouts and this artist makes the perfect book for teaching a class when you are a volunteer yourself that is not an art pro.<br /><br />In this book, he shows us how to make animals in drawings that when finished, you will be shocked it came from your pencil. The drawing is so simple, but looks complex when finished. Also see his book, \\"Make a World\\", and \\"The Big Green Drawing Book\\".
B0000DJZA5|3.0|To begin with Let it be (Naked) is better than the original, to start with the track placement is better (with Let it Be ending the album) & the inclusion of Don't let me Down is a great move. The production is more crisp & all the songs are much more directed, yes maybe this was the way Paul, John, Ringo & George wanted this album to be like back in 1969, but there are problems!!! <br /> <br />The album still has the same songs (except the before mentioned Don't let me down, and two other filler songs left of this from the original album) but Long winding Road (The Beatles most overated song) Two of us, I've got a feeling, One after 909, & I be mine remain fillers, and that's nearly half the album. Still the songs Get Back, All across the Universe, and Let it Be are classics, and if you're a big Beatles fan then these are essential songs to add to your collection if you already haven't got them!!!! <br /> <br />But Let it Be (Naked) though an improvement is hardly the great masterpiece some of this albums marketers claimed it to be & although an improvement & it does include the fantastic song Don't let me down it still remains a piece of The Beatles catelogue you would still buy once you've purchased A Hard Days Night, Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Peppers, Magical Mystery Tour, The White Album, & Abbey Road!!!!

B000002UDB|5.0|OK it's not their best effort & Magical Mystery Tour was just an album of left over or Non LP singles like I am the Walrus, & Strawberry Fields but if there was any Beatles or indeed it could be any album that probably defined the 60's then this came pretty damn close I'd say, in short Magical Mystery Tour is a trip (probably with alot of LSD assistance) of the 1960's!!! <br /> <br />It tells of of how in the 1960's no one knew what to expect & it all seemed like a show & a big mystery (Magical Mystery Tour, Flying, Blue Jay Jane). How we all fell in & out of love (Hello Goodbye) and how it made us all mad (Your mother should know) & all the new stuff around like drugs (I am the Warus, Strawberry Fields) and places we had never heard off (Penny Lane). But at the end of the day, the most important thing in the 1960's was love & peace (All you need is love). <br /> <br />Overall Magical Mystery Tour is a great selection of Pop songs and Pop hit singles all of which show that The Beatles were always on top of their game whether making albums or one off songs. Yes Magical Mystery Tour is indeed magical, and I for one am glad I popped on board & I definitely enjoyed the show, and I know you will too!!!!

0553277472|5.0|Reading \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" was a strange experience, as the plot was so hidden behind the philosophy.  This did not, however, make the book any less interesting.  What started off as a series of remarks about how to enjoy a trip through the country on a motorcycle continued with snippets of memories from the enigmatic Phaedrus, and was all interspaced with the narrators own philosophy.  Throughout the book, bits of backstory were brought up, so it is only at the end that the reader finds out the identity of Phaedrus and hisrealtion to the narrator.   <br /> <br />However, it is the philosophic insights, more than the plot, which more this story along.  Ideas and ideals are ripped apart, dissected and reasembled in this strange but fascinationg journey through a country, through memories, and through philosophy.
B0002X314C|1.0|this album only has 2 good songs and that's it. get lifted my ass.
B0000844IT|3.0|Thats all this movie is, nothing like evildead 1 or evildead 2, but it is good and a must to have in any collection. The humor in this movie is excellent very funny the action is there NO GORE at all and I never seen this movie and just brought this edition  the one I am reviewing. <br /> <br />Please dont spend 45$ on this I found this movie the regular version in SamGoody for $6.99 and in Suncoast video found the Broom stick 2 disc edition and payed $10 so b4 you get riopped off look hard for it Sam Goody and/or Best buy might have it maybe even FYE.
0316172324|5.0|What I loved most about this book, along with the author's writing style, are the many examples given where quick decisions are many times based on first impressions, and how many times those impressions are right.  <br /> <br />This is an interesting book! It's well thought out, well written, and I found it to be not only an enjoyable read, but also one that validates something I have long believed in: That first impressions hold a lot of weight, and are often accurate.  <br />
0385337388|3.0|As a medical student this book was recommended on several accounts by both patients, residents and fellows and held in high acclaim. <br /> <br />To be honest, upon reading, I found the lead character rather unlikable.  He is transparent as he projects those he holds in favor in a bright light (which is understandable given it's his book) and those he dislikes as people who can do no right-Joan and her casserole is a case in point.  In this sense, he does what psychologists would refer to as splitting, and I found it shallow.  Beyond this, I personally felt him to be rather self-righteous, whiny, and complaining while holding those he held in favor in high esteem. I gave up around page 163 out of lack of interest for his character. He could have jumped off a ledge as Joan's father for all I cared!   <br /> <br />That said, he seems to have amassed many fans among the layman and is recommended reading by the general public- I can't endorse this, however.   Happy hunting, should you so choose.  I am in the minority of negative reviews, so it seems...
076113719X|5.0|I have been buying this calander since 1999, I love it it is the best.  It has 5 columns just enough for me my hubby and 3 girls.  Everyone has their own column.  We could not function without it.  Everyone should use this.
B00005JN5X|4.0|This is an odd pairing of Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as the brothers Grimm, who start the film as a pair of con artists engaged in \\"exorcising\\" hapless villages of \\"witches\\" in return for gold. Their activities attract the notice of the Napoleonic authorities, who threaten them into solving another witch haunting that they didn't have anything to do with. The problem is, this one is real. Filled with bad puns and stuffed full of elements of just about every Grimm fairy tale one can imagine, this film is occassionally ourageous, but always a delight.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Johnny Cash's San Quentin is just a great live album.  No matter what genre of music you listen to, you owe it to yourself to get this album.  My father had this album when I was a kid and I would burn it up on the record player when my parents were away.  This cd is improved with several extra tracks and sounds pretty good considering that it was recorded in a prison, not known for great acoustics.<br /><br />The cd is a classic and is amazing to see how comfortable Cash is in this setting.  His interactions with the inmates during the cd help set the mood and helped to solidify Cash's stance as an outsider in the country music world.  Who else could go into two of the country's most notorious prisons and work the crowd the way Johnny does?<br /><br />The songs are timeless, with such standouts as \\"I Walk the Line\\", \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" and \\"A Boy Names Sue\\".  Chances are you've heard the songs, but you haven't experienced Johnny Cash until you've listened to San Quentin and Folsom Prison.  Both cds are a must have.
B000957O82|5.0|I looked at the cover and was not so impressed,  but hey, it was Will Smith, so it would be worth a few laughs.  It has been a hard week and my wife and I needed something light. <br /> <br />Wow!  We just got done watching this movie and I laughed more than I have laughed at a movie in a while!  It was funny.  It was romantic!   <br /> <br />Does it get predictable at parts?  Yes.  Does it cross into the \\"cute\\" realm a couple of times?  Yes.  It is not perfect, but it is a very good movie. <br /> <br />Will Smith does an awesome job in the character.  Not many people can play the nerd-gone-player, but he pulls it off perfectly.  Eva Mendes does an awesome job as the love interest playing a character with just enough complication to make you buy in.  Kevin James is priceless and almost steals the show from Will Smith!  He is the ultimate underdog that you can't help but to cheer for!  Amber Valleta did a good job but she looks just enough like Cameron Diaz that you almost have Something About Mary flashbacks at some of the funny parts, but I mean that as a compliment.  Julie Ann Emery played the female underdog that reminded me of \\"that single friend\\" that most young wives seem to have when they get married.  We all knew someone like her character who just needed a chance with that one someone who was out there somewhere. <br /> <br />All in all, this movie is not meant to be anything other than a good laugh with just enough romantic twist to make you want to snuggle a little tighter between the laughs.  If you are looking for that cute date movie, be it your third date or a date night at home while the kids are staying over with the grandparents, this is a perfect movie.  You walk away holding hands with smiles on your faces. <br /> <br />Oh, and you guys on the third date ... rent this movie, sit close, play it cool, and only lean 90% when the movie is over.  Don't know what I mean?  Watch the movie ... you'll see!
B000001EUN|4.0|This is one of the Scorpions best  overall CDs. The guitar riffs are classic and the guitar sound is hard and crisp. \\"The Zoo\\", of course, is a standout with its slow crunchy riff and Klaus talking and whispering the verses as much as singing them. \\"Make it Real\\" is fast paced with another great riff that gets the CD started off perfectly. Every song will have you jamming along with it. \\"Lady Starlight\\" is a ballad which a lot of people seem to like but it doesn't do anything for me. It's the only song on the CD that I sometimes skip. If you're a Scorpions fan, you have to have Animal Magnetism.
B00005JN5X|1.0|This is the first film in all my 31 years that I've ever walked out of - and I saw RESIDENT EVIL APOCALYPSE, people!! <br /> <br />I won't dignify the film with any semblance of a review, other than to say that there were several long scenes of characters just literally standing still looking off into the distance as if even the actors had no idea what to do with each scene!  In the first hour that I endured, I lauged once, that's it.   <br /> <br />I left when a kitten was kicked into a rotating fan and was diced up with blood spattering the people around it.  A small piece of bloody flesh landed on a man's cheek.  He paused, then peeled it off and ate it.  This was all supposed to be funny - look, I know people hate cats.  I hate dogs myself - but I don't think they deserve to be sliced and diced for amusement.  Yes, it's just a fake scene in a movie - but it reveals a sick mind, and this film has a sick undercurrent (at the time I left, three children had been killed - one whisked away by an unseen force, one who encountered a man with a hatchet singing a lullabye, and one swallowed whole by a possessed horse).  I'm shocked and appalled that this film did not receive an R-rating. <br /> <br />Perhaps if the story and its characters had been the remotest bit interesting, I'd have stayed with it.  But I was already bored to tears by the time the kitty-puree scene came about. <br /> <br />Please do not support this sick film - show Hollywood how tired we are of summer tripe like this! <br /> <br />SIDE NOTE - if you want a movie that was actually good with the exact same plot, rent Peter Jackson's THE FRIGHTENERS - much more entertaining, funny, and appropriately rated-R.
0789723107|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has anything to do with web development and marketing. Its main focus is on simple thing that makes up 70% of website usability.     You'll learn a little about human interaction with web sites, usability testing and design do's and don'ts. Don't think that you'll become a \\"Marketing Pro\\" if you read this book, BUT it will definitely help you create a site that brings results and not just a nice picture.    This was a very easy and a quick read. Bottom line is, read this book to become better at what you do if it is in anyway connected to website development, online marketing, advertising or usability.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|First off,  <br />  SOAD is one of my favorite bands of all times so maybe I'm being a little unfair to SOAD but compared to their first 2 albums this one is LAME!!! <br />  <br />  Their lyrics have just gotten shallow and cliche.  It's all about: Bush sucks, Iraq sucks, Tony Danza sucks, people who think they're better than you suck, Hollywood sucks yata yata yata.  Not only have their lyrics gotten cheaper but they've gone very soft too. <br />   My favorite part of this whole CD is on track 5 \\"Radio/Video\\" at the end when it starts to sound like an Armenian folksong.   <br />  The dark ambiguous poetic depth of their self title album and Toxicity seems to be missing along with the chaotic, conflicted beauty of their songs.  Here's a synopsis of what \\"Mezmerize\\" is not: <br /> <br />Their anti-Gov songs on Mezmerize don't compare to songs like: <br />1. Prison Song (Toxicity) <br />2. P.L.U.C.K   (Self titled) <br />3. War?        (Self titled) <br />4. F--- the System (Steal this Album) <br /> <br />The ballads are nowhere close to: <br />1. Aerials (toxicity) <br />2. Spiders (Self titled) <br />3  Innervision (Steal this Album) <br /> <br />No dark and heavy, thought provoking songs like: <br />1. Toxicity, Chop Suey, forest, science, ATWA, (all toxicity) <br />2. Suite-Pee,  <br /> <br />No raw heavy/crazy all around weird (but kickass) songs like: <br />1. Jet Pilot, Needles, Shimmy, Psycho or X <br />2. Know, Sugar, Ddevil, Darts (one of my favorites), suggestions, or Soil (all self-titled) <br /> <br />So in summary, it's not at all a bad album.  It has some very catchy tunes like BYOB, Radio/Video, Revenga, Question, Sad Statue and the 2 Hollywood songs.  But it's not of the same aesthetic, chaotic, lyrical and philosophical quality of their 1st 2 albums. <br /> <br />Toxicity and their self-titled set a very high standard.  I expected a little more from this CD and was disappointed.  But if you're new to System then it's a good CD to start with. <br />
B000002U82|5.0|It may not be The Wall but it's damn good and thanks Tayma for whoring your crappy emo bands here. <br /> <br />Breathe and Money are two of the best and most Classic songs of all time with David putting out some of the best solos and rifts to ever be heard or atleast until the Wall. <br /> <br />It's no wonder Gilmoure has claimed the Worlds Greatest Guitarist spot for over two years.
B00005JNEI|4.0|people who hated Bush. But if you think you are netural and want the truth, you should a get a copy of the Fahren-HYPE 9/11 as well. I'm giving a 4 star ratings for entertainment and the handling of true facts to present a false idea (very crafty). For example, visit of Taliban to Texas appears to be related to Bush (then the grovenor of Texas), but the visit was in fact orginaized by the State Dept of Clinton's Adm. There are many more false impression presented with real facts...
B0000AUHRG|4.0|After telling a friend about Ray Bradbury's FARENHEIT 451, my friend told me about the movie EQUILIBRIUM and suggested that I see it.  Upon this recommendation, I watched the movie and was not disappointed.<br /><br />EQUILIBRIUM is a movie that takes place in the not-so-distant future. After years of war that have wracked and scarred the planet, a new government has taken control and from all appearances things seem at peace.  The new government keeps order because all forms of Art: paintings, music, literature, etc; have been outlawed and made illegal. To ensure that no Art is produced, a group of specially trained officers known as Grammaton Clerics are trained to find hidden Art, destroy it, and kill those who produce it.  Needless to say, an underground rebellion rises up to fight against the oppression.  The resistance finds their hero in the most famous of the Clerics, John Preston (Christian Bale).  Preston was forced to kill his partner, Partridge, when Partridge refused to turn in a book of poetry that had been confiscated.  Through reading those poems, Preston, like a futuristic Apostle Paul, begins to realize the oppression that he has had a help in creating and seeks to set things right.<br /><br />EQUILIBRIUM borrows many elements from the best of sci-fi. The dystopian society reminds one of George Orwell's 1984 or Ray Bradbury's FARENHEIT 451. Preston is in many ways a conglomeration of the firemen in FARENHEIT 451 and Harrison Bergeron from Kurt Vonnegut's famous story. The \\"Gun Kata\\" martial art that is introduced in the film reminds one of fighting scenes in THE MATRIX.  However, despite all the similarities, EQUILIBRIUM does an excellent job of incorporating this various sci-fi themes and molding them together into something that is original.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that the film went unnoticed in theatres.  The movie has some great acting, good special effects, and great plot and character development. It's a sci-fi movie worth watching.hing.
B0000020C4|5.0|Perfect!  If you are considering, buy the CD AND the DVD.  We have owned it for years.  All my kids love it and I love it (kids are now in very late teens).  Even seeing in NYC could not compare with these voices and performances! <br /> <br />
079073639X|1.0|Star studded clunker with oodles of promise at the beginning only to turn into trite trash at the end.  Why would anyone make a movie this bad? Furthermore,why would Barry Levinson make a movie this bad? I suppose I will be on my way to unlocking at least one of the secrets of Hollywood when I figure that out. This is so awful it probably killed reprint sales of the book for a time. <br /> <br />Just terrible. Made no sense whatsoever, and will insult whatever intelligence you have with its thoughtless, cynical moral, which is somewhere along the lines of \\"if we could bring to existence whatever we dream, it'd all be ugly and horrible because that's what people are made of.\\" Real deep, huh?

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Hey guys... great season.  Up there with the first.  But I have an important question that I don't see anywhere on the Internet.  Does anyone have a problem on Disc One with episode New Era (4th episode)?  When I start that episode it looks really bad but it clears up by the first scene.  It really looks horrible and u should notice the lines that appear and it is jumpy when the water appears on screen.  I'm gonna go to Target and exchange my copy and hope that it was just my DVD.  Anyone else have this problem?  Please let me know if you can.  Check it out and let me know.  Love the OC!

B000002UZU|5.0|I wore a hole in this vinyl record simply because it was definitive blues at its best. <br />The interaction between the legend John Lee Hooker and Canned Heat was incomparable, confirmed by Hooker's patter between tracks. <br />The rawness is still there but with that added polish. At one point Hooker suggests they have enough for a \\"triple album\\" which would mean \\"triple money\\". A shame it wasn't a triple album, it records both Hooker and Canned Heat at their pinnacle. <br />If you want to hear Blues music played in its purest form buy this album, it doesn't get any better. John Lee Hooker is at his articulate best and it is surely a definitive blues album which recorded a magic moment in time. Al \\"Blind Owl\\" Wilson's harp playing went hand in glove with Hooker's playing and he says between tracks that Wilson must have been listening to his records all his life, it truly is inspired playing. A tragedy that Wilson overdosed shortly afterwards, he was at the height of his musical powers. <br />The production is excellent and did justice to the musical experience. <br /> <br />This is one of the classic albums of modern times. If you like John Lee, I believe he produced no better album than this, Canned Heat stayed in the background and let him do his thing, whilst providing the best backing band he had ever experienced. <br />An absolute gem!!!! <br />
B00009ZYBY|5.0|GREAT MOVIE. NO SUGAR COATING. SHOWS ALL THE BRUTALITY AND PAIN AND SUFFERING CAUSED BY INSANE LEADERS. MUCH OF LIKE OUR LEADERS TODAY
068987474X|1.0|I bought this book for entertainment value, thinking it was humor. When I realized it's a completely serious, self help book, I couldn't believe it. Each chapter says the same thing (even thought I couldn't make it past 3 before doing a quick scan the rest of the way.)  If anyone actually NEEDS this book to tell them what it does, I feel really bad for those people. I know some men that need to be told when a woman is not that into them (hint, hint) so maybe there are women this dense out there. If you are intelligent, not desperate and looking for a humorous book, you can find one elsewhere.    If I'm making a mistake and it was written for humorous purposes, it's not.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was one of those who believed that there could never be another Phantom other than Michael Crawford.  How could someone musically fill his shoes?  Realistically, no one ever could.  While watching the movie, with my original skepticism, I began to realize that Gerrard Butler was not trying to be Michael Crawford's Phantom, he was creating his own.  I fell in love with Gerrard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom half way through his first song.  The way he is able to portray such incredible raw emotion is simply breathtaking..... each time he sings to Christine before becoming unmasked, my breath catches and I feel the agony that he feels, the begging for acceptance, the longing to be loved.  The way his eyes search Christine's, the pain in them, the desperation... Gerrard Butler far exceeded my expectations as Phantom. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone.  The cast is exceptional, and as always, the score is unmatchable.
B00003CXCT|5.0|My son was thrilled to receive it.  Our family has thoroughly enjoyed watching these DVD's over and over again.
B00097DX3U|5.0|What can I say? This is one great album. \\"Out of Exile\\" is a great testimony of the musical skills of each member and the measure of growth from their first album. One of the first differences I've noticed was the overall quality of their music has become more cohesive and smoothed towards classic rock. What I have really enjoyed was that the talents of each member of the band shines through and complements one another, instead of outworking one another. Chris' voice and lyrics are poetic as well as haunting as ever through songs such as \\"Your Time Has Come,\\" \\"Out of Exile,\\" and \\"Be Yourself.\\" The sophomore album also brings in brighter songs such as the beautiful \\"Dandelion\\" and \\"Doesn't Remind Me.\\" Simply stated, this album has great songs each worthy of individual recognition, proving that Audioslave is more than the sum of its parts.

B0006Z2LCE|5.0|People complain that too many Donna Summer hits compilations have already been released, but \\"Gold\\" offers the most comprehensive anthology of an artist who peaked - commercially, at least - a long time ago. Some of the real bonuses of this release include uniformly excellent sound and full production credits for all the tracks, as well as full or previously unavailable versions: the 4:57 edit of \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" is the best of the edits; similarly, the 6:28 promo single version of \\"MacArthur Park\\"; \\"I Feel Love\\" is finally included in an anthology in its superb full length album version; the fantastic 6:47 12\\" single version of \\"Hot Stuff\\" (not included even on the recent Deluxe release of \\"Bad Girls\\"); the definitive 5:49 full version of \\"State Of Independence\\" (for many her best-ever recording). Her later releases are rightly included as single or edited versions, and whatever you think of them, it's good to hear so many brought together; the Tony Moran edit of \\"You're So Beautiful\\" (first available on 2003's compilation \\"The Journey\\") ends the album on a high. A real attempt has been made with \\"Gold\\" to provide the best-possible summary of Summer's career, and for my money this is a great anthology for both fan and newcomer alike.
B00079018K|5.0|What is wrong with you Americans eh? You're supposed to review the MUSIC and all I've read is you lot moaning about the disc being protected. Now come on, who nowadays doesn't own a stereo? Please get a grip and stop moaning that you can't play it on your computer and just play it on your stereo, this isn't the band's fault so as for the 'I'm not gonna give them any money...' rubbish please grow up. <br />Now, as for the actual album, it's extremely good. Please don't compare them to the 90's Britpop scene as they sound nothing like the likes of Blur, Cast, Oasis or Suede. They also sound nothing like The Stone Roses or Happy Mondays as these bands had a type of sound which is their own, they broke Indie into the mainstream and this will never be re-created. And as for the comments stating they're unoriginal, they are very original for the moment in an industry filled with manufactured groups and rubbish like Pop Idol. The tracks are strong, rocking, and a breath of fresh air. As I said, they won't re-create the late 80's scene, but why would you want them to? The one thing they have kept is a very British Indie sound which other American bands try to take as their own (such as The Strokes etc). Indie is British and if you want a taste of the new wave of typically British Indie music then BUY the album. Nuff said.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is not as good as Parachutes or A Rush of Blood to the Head and personally, it took me a few times before I really got into it but after I finally got into it I listened to nothing else for weeks.  So, give it a shot, it takes a little time to get into, but it is glorious.
0385486804|4.0|Into the Wild was one of the books on a list with two others to choose from for summer reading. The reason I chose this one was mainly because of its short, sweet, and exactly to the point description. It was also shorter than the other two by at least 150 pages (it's actually a 200-paged book). About halfway into it(and later on especially chapters 14 and 15, strictly about the author), I began to consider resorting to reading one of the other longer books in hopes that one would, somehow, get my attention more than this one was. What I didn't realize, though, was that it had and I didn't even know how! I was already on page 100, so I became hooked since then, not comprehending how fast everything was going.  <br /> <br />I will be honest...the beginning does not really hook the reader. It starts off with a guy named Jim Gallien giving Chris a lift. Later on, I see Jim's relevance in the book as all of the characters in chronological order begin to fall into place starting from when Chris left Emory. Speaking of characters...BEWARE! If you have to do a report on this book, there's at least 25 characters mentioned, 15 of which had brief but important contact with Chris McCandless. I had to write each character down and his or her significance with Chris after realizing I wouldn't be able to keep track of them all.  <br /> <br />The book itself, as I've mentioned, starts where Chris goes into Alska for his \\"odyssey.\\" Later, we find out that the encounter with Jim comes much later than in the beginning of the book. I felt that there was more describing the lives of the author and other hikers/mountain climbers than explaining what Chris felt in the inside. In the end, however, the stories of the lives of these people who, at first, seem completely random and irrelevant helped me to better understand Chris since there were similarities about him. They actually had journals and friends who knew them better than Chris's friends knew him. These hikers, like evertt ruess and john, enlightened the situation of feeling no type of connection to understading Chris and helped fill the gap of questions in my mind of him. I didn't even notice this was a true story until it became too real to be a work of fiction. I looked it up and sure enough this story had happeend. And in that case, there's really nothing to do but use your intellect to draw a conclusion for Chris's actions since there is NOTHING to describe how he felt or what his suffering was like other than a cheap \\"NO FOOD TODAY\\" description since all his jornal talked about whas game he had managed to kill. By the end of the book, after reading it in less than two days, I was sad it had to end, happy that summer reading had ended as well. In the beginning of each chapter, there's always some type of quote by famous authors that, mostly, Chris enjoyed. I didn't quite understand some of them. This story being true, though, really touched my heart and made up for not being able to easily decipher Chris. Had this been fiction, it would have easily gotten 3 stars from me. However, its true context helped calm my mixed and bittersweet emotions about Chris and why he acted so stubborn but was so brilliant. For this, it gets four.  <br /> <br />This book, I would have to say, was one of the handful of books I can honestly say had me reading when I suddenly had nothing else to do. I don't normally go for reading books....especially ones given by the school to help revive my wandering and bored mind unless I know I like it. This book was written beautifully and in the end, had me satisfied and all questions answered. I do know why he went into the wild, and I will not critisize him for doing so. If only he had lived...READERS! I suggest you read this book. It's not too long to the point where you eventually just put it down and leave another 2357834 chapters be left unread, nor is it so short where your mind is baffled and disappointed in the book's short-lived \\"life.\\" Would I read this again? Probably not; books like this aren't the type that I would read over and over again. Was it worth reading? Absolutely! Would I have, if I had the chance to go back in time, chose to read this book before the other two? I procrastinate...any book that has 150 pages less than two others will get me to read it! I can't help but feel badly for Chris and how hurt his family was, or Ronal Franz as well, a character most touched by Chris. I won't forget his journey, and neither will you. A bit hard to follow, it still all added up in the end. It's a tragedy...very thrilling and exciting...I felt like I was there in the book the times Chris was talked about! i definitely recommend! <br /> <br />-Dockers
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Sergio Leone is a master at capturing a time in history and a sense for it's ruggedness.  The characters are just as hard as the landscape around them.  A Western movie you won't soon forget.
B000002HAF|5.0|\\"Surfer Rosa\\" was my very first Pixies album, and the one that I feel is the band's best. Each song transitions well, making the album cohesive, while every song feels just as relevant as the last. \\"Bone Machine\\" provides a gritty opening.. the guitar work is sensational, while the vocal interplay between Frank Black and Kim Deal, one of the rare examples on this album, is captivating. The songs that follow, \\"Break My Body\\" and \\"Something Against You\\" continue in the same vein as the opening track in terms of the intensity of guitar work and Black's tone, while \\"Broken Face\\" employs a lighter mood with Black opening the song with vocal play and witty lyrics \\"I've got no lips/I've got no tongue/when ever I talk it's only spit.\\"  Track 5, \\"Gigantic\\" is a highlight of the album, with Kim Deal getting to show off her bass playing and vocal ability. \\"River Euphrates\\" and \\"Where is My Mind?\\", the latter perhaps the better known of the two songs, are both solid and fun to sing along to. Track 8, \\"Cactus,\\" is one of my favorite Pixies songs because the light guitar work, the heavy rhythm section, Black's nervous vocals that contrast to Deal's husky confidence, and the lyrics (\\"Wishing that I had just somethin' you wore/Bloody your hands on a cactus tree/Wipe it on your dress/then send it to me\\") are just so undeniably sexy. The songs that follow, \\"Tony's Theme,\\" \\"Oh My Golly!\\", \\"Vamos,\\" and \\"I'm Amazed\\", are great because the album doesn't slow at all, despite being over half-way done. \\"Oh My Golly\\" and \\"Vamos\\" are two great Spanglish songs. They're amusing because it's clear that Black has a decent ability with the language and the music accompanying the lyrics matches it so well. The only thing better than buying \\"Surfer Rosa\\" and listening to Joey Santiago's solo on \\"Vamos\\" is buying a ticket to a show and seeing it. It's amazing! \\"I'm Amazed\\" slows the album, while \\"Brick is Red\\" adequately brings it to a close. If this were a novel, it would be on of the Pixies' best.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love this movie to the point of watching it every few days. The reveiws I have read that down grade Gerard Butlers singing are so wrong. I think Crawford has none of the emotion Butler shows.Watching it onstage can you see the expression in the eyes and the tears falling down his cheeks.Come on people,use your heads. There is no way you can see the emotion in his face the way Butler shows it to the point that your heart aches for him.As for his singing, I cannot explain the pull to the heartstrings he causes.There is just something in his deeper voice that makes it much easier to listen to if your not inclined to love opera music.Gerard Butler should have received so much more recognition from this movie. He has such capability to become whomever his character is that he must portray.There are so many people that feel the same as me that I wish there were something we could do.I feel the same about Emmy Rossum. She is outstanding and so lovely to look at.I just hope she doesn't go the way of most of the actresses today and start flaunting her body to the world.I hope I did not hurt too many feelings.This is just my opinion.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Great best of. You can't get much more clear than this. Just about everything you love from the number one guitarest of all time is on this very album. Jimi.....peace and respect. The world misses you.
0553212737|3.0|It's not that I don't like Emma as a character, I do! It's great that she's a bit flawed and gets into messes because of her arrogance, and I even liked the storyline (though to be honest it's probably only because of \\"Clueless\\") to a certain extent - I just felt it was a little dull.  <br /> <br />Nothing ever really seemed to happen. People just talked. A lot. And I felt that the whole 367 pages (of my copy) could have been cut down to 150 - at least! The one possibly exciting part (Harriet and the gypsies) you didn't see happen, as it was only ever talked about. Like the rest of the book.  <br /> <br />It's the first Austen I've read and has - I hate to say - slightly put me off trying any of her others, although I probably will in time. <br /> <br />If you like charming books of light humour and romance - or just Austen - I'm sure you'll enjoy Emma, but if like me, you are used to a bit more excitement and adventure, you might want to try something else.  Sweet, but not much else.  <br />
0385513755|2.0|So, considering this book's success I'm not going to try and disuade everyone from reading this. Too many people like it, so that's fine. I will, however, put out my warning flares to certain readers...<br /><br />If you like quality literary fiction and if you like well-crafted commercial fiction (James Lee Burke, John Grisham, even Michael Crichton, for example) this might not be the book for you. The writing is poor. This is that sort of novel that somebody who never reads fiction might say, \\"If I had the time I could write this...\\" And he'd be right. I found this very frustrating line for line. I couldn't count the number of times that some \\"surprising\\" revelation left the characters \\"stupefied\\", \\"amazed\\", \\"incredulous\\", etc, etc. It happens on almost every page. And that's part of the problem.<br /><br />This novel is written for very short attention spans. Brown wants to make sure he's hooked his readers back in on almost every page. Is that bad? Well, yes, for me it is when it's cheap tricks and poor writing that he's using to do it. I've never read a novel that pretended to be intellectual and yet spoke down to it's audience again and again. Believe me, any time that Brown's characters uncover something the author makes it painfully obvious to the reader, as if he wants to make sure you haven't missed it, haven't misunderstood, aren't confused...<br /><br />This novel is fine for people who aren't bothered about quality writing. It's probably a great one for people who don't often read fiction. You can enjoy this even if you're barely literate. Yes, he mentions European places and art and historical figures and the Bible, but this is not complicated material. He does have at the core an interesting idea - a secret that suggests an entirely different take on what Christianity should've been. But this could be stated in two well-crafted sentences. Really. I could write the whole mysterious premise of this book in about fifty words. The fact that Dan Brown managed to spin that into one of the biggest books in history is amazing - but not for the right reasons.<br /><br />You may be prompted to buy this just because it's so massively successful. But bulk sales actually suggest low quality. This is good the way McDonald's is the biggest restaurant chain in the world and therefore must have the best food. It's good the way Mexico City is so full of people it must be a great place to live. It's good in the way that Taco Bell must make the best Mexican food. It's good in the way that Britney Spears must be one of the world's best singers...<br /><br />I know, I'm reaching about, but it's true. The fact that this book is so popular doesn't mean it MUST be that good. It means it CAN'T be that good. Ironic, I know. I'm not out to tell the masses not to buy this. I don't hate Dan Brown for becoming a millionaire. But I do want to say to people who've been told this is a new, American Umberto Eco that that's simply not true. If Umberto Eco had written on this topic the book would've been wonderful, complex, intelligent. And it would've sold about 15 million LESS copies.<br /><br />People who are borderline on buying this might as well not buy it. Wait until the movie comes out. I've no doubt that they'll be able to fleshs this out, give credible actors the job of bringing it to life, rewrite the dialogue and improve the plotting. Then it might be interesting. Yes, I am saying that this is one book that'll probably be better as a movie. That doesn't happen often, but this novel is thin enough in terms of plot and character to give a filmaker the freedom to make it better. I bet they will.rown managed to spin that into one of the biggest books in history is amazing - but not for the right reasons.  <br /> <br />You may be prompted to buy this just because it's so massively successful.

B00000K3D4|5.0|This is a great movie!  It really brings out the child in me, and I can't help but get all the terrific songs stuck in my head all day.  The acting is great from both young Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, whose character, Jareth, I love the most.  He really brings the character to life.<br /><br />The puppetry and special effects might be considered a tad cheesy by today's standards, but I honestly don't see how it could detract from such a wonderful story and great direction.  It's a charming little fantasy, giving viewers an escape from everyday life.  Watch it and love it. :)
B000268QB2|5.0|I first heard Keane at my sister's. She told me she'd first heard them recommended if you like Coldplay - who we both love. But I must say, other than simple, crafted songs and a piano, the similarities are few. <br />The lead singer, Tom Chaplin, has one of the clearest, sweetest voices I have ever heard. He hits notes most women singers that sell today can't hit. And sounds better doing it. <br />And the lack of a guitar is refreshing. I think the guitar is one of the most abused instruments in music. And the piano is sadly under-used. But thankfully not here. <br />All together, an excellent choice, especially if you like lovely, simple music.
B000009RC2|5.0|After seeing the Mahavishnu Orchestra live I couldn't speak for an hour. When this appeared in the 70s it was totally shocking: much more than just jazz/rock fusion (as offered by Chick Corea or Weather Report) this was a previously unheard-of mixture of the rawest-sounding rock guitar with jazz complexity and mind-stretching Indian beats, all executed by brilliant players (Billy Cobham is simply a freak - on another occasion I saw him playing with 2 sticks in each hand, each stick doing something different, and on this album you'd swear there are 2 drummers, but no, it's just Billy, with no overdubs - and Jerry Goodman injects some of the tastiest rock violin ever).     McLoughlin was in the middle of a 5-year devotion to guru Sri Chinmoy, and as his earlier album's title put it, 'My Goal's Beyond'. So if you want pretty music, or rock, or jazz, this isn't it - this is beyond convention, even beyond beauty (though Lotus On Irish Streams, the one acoustic track, is very beautiful): it walks up to and makes friends with the dark and chaotic side of the universe, though always revealing a strict if complex structure underneath. Subsequent Mahavishnu albums got more and more commercial-sounding: the follow-up, Birds of Fire, is very good but much tidier than this, while their last, Inner Worlds, is utterly domesticated and toothless. Only the live album, Between Nothingness and Eternity, comes anywhere near the brutal and, why not say it, cosmic power of this untamed tiger.
B00005JNTX|4.0|So hungry I am for originality. So hungry I am for filmmakers with a unique vision and the know-how to give us something new and MEMORABLE!!!!!  SO HUNGRY I AM FOR MORE SIN CITY!!!!!<br /><br />Thank you, thank you, thank you Frank Miller, Robert Rodriquez, Quentin Tarantino and everyone else who had anything to do with this BEAUTIFUL film. Beautiful? Yes! It is. Violent. Grisly. But, beautifully shot and designed. From the rain, to the snow, to the faces, to the colors and yes... the blood.<br /><br />All who were involved with Sin City earned some serious brownie points with me because you gave us what we all have been hungry for, for so long. You took us and our imaginations to a new place. You told us stories that pulled no punches and kept us on our toes.<br /><br />In a slew of Non-original, cookie-cutter, same old same old films, mixed with all the lack of new idea remakes, SIN CITY proved to me that the film business still has a pulse.<br /><br />Sin City, with a phenominal cast (Mickey Rourke may have saved his career here), delivered on a phenominal level. With its 60s style and Humphrey Bogartish delivery, it packed a tremendous punch of creativity, design, grit and grime.<br /><br />With it's beautiful black and white colors and the occasional splash of red, it moves like a painting... with 3 intertwining stories of the inhabitants of Sin City. The low, the lower and the even lower... with an occassional splash of righteousnous.<br /><br />Yet, after watching Sin City, I couldn't help thinking that there were so many more stories to be told. I want to see more, and I want to read Frank Miller's books now.  I want to see Senator Roarke get what he deserves!!  He has to!<br /><br />This movie is great. It really is. If anything, even if you don't like violence, hitting the play button, YOU WILL see something new, original and CREATIVE.<br /><br />Finally... I'm only giving it 4 stars because the DVD is sorta bare bones... Surely, the special edition will be coming soon! Hopefully!ial edition will be coming soon! Hopefully!

B0009VRHLK|1.0|Curiosity got the best of me. There was so much hype about how bad this was but you just had to see it, so I fell for it.<br /><br />You don't have to see it. Apart from an incredibly graphic oral sex scene, there really is nothing eye catching about the film. The only thing I got from the film was that the people involved had to be incredibly STONED in order to do the things on film that they did (Chloe Sevigny, what were you thinking?).<br /><br />I'm not gonna waste too much time with a rambling review because enough of my time was wasted on this film about a guy who is driving across country trying to forget his girlfriend.<br /><br />The second he walked into a gas station and in an INCREDIBLY CREEPY way... asked the high school age girl if she would come with him cross country... twice he says... 'please' unblinking eyes, staring... 'please'.  It gave me the willies... and the willies weren't intended. In fact, the exact opposite is intended. He's supposed to be appealling.  In fact though, he is more APPALLING than anything.  What is more appalling is that the girl GOES WITH HIM!!<br /><br />In fact, the creepy looking Vincent Gallo is apprently a chick magnet... even at truck stops.<br /><br />Dear lord this movie was incredibly pointless and boring and would have been better if they had extended the porn theme across the entire film and released it as XXX.<br /><br />Oh... and I'm a college graduate... a huge film observer and a writer.

Funny, but not quite as funny as the reviewer who told some random kid off who dared to say this is a very tedious album, viciously cut said kid to shreds via his rapier wit with a \\"i bet you listen to nsync everyday\\" comment (ohhh, stinging!) and ended by telling him \\"every song on this album are awesome\\".

0780624890|5.0|Blade's now my favorite fantasy/super/whatever hero.  It caught me right away in the bloodbath opening scene with morbid curiosity.  Blade is one of those superheroes that doesn't show much emotion at all but he still grabs and keeps the audience's attention.<br /><br />The movie gets you in mood for its dark story and explains things very well in the plot.  The acting is mostly superb and the characters make you loathe them or love them and it's got fantastic imagery.<br /><br />I'm not even a vampire/fiction fan, so it always seemed out of place that I'm a fan of Blade.  But I like it...you might too.  It's not the typical vampire story--vampires hanging out in cobwebbed corners waiting to scare you to death before sucking you dry.  They're high-tech-style bloodsuckers with Frost as their leader trying to get back down to the vampire roots.<br /><br />You'll see...it's worth it.

B000002NFM|5.0|I heard one of the songs in a store and *had* to buy the CD.  It took a while to find it...but it was so worth it.  I immediately recognized a few of them as my regular favorites (I had no idea I was a Prodigy fan) and took to the CD right away.<br /><br />It's packed with energy and driving beats.  It's melodic at sometimes, it's consistant but it's varying, it's just amazing.  I find it great for climbing sessions or preparing for a competition (or even tests...whatever happens to be the stressor at the time).<br /><br />Of all the Prodigy CDs I've now heard, this one is my favorite.  I'd strongly recommend it into the repetoire of any techno fan.
B00005JNSK|4.0|The main reason I didn't like this movie is because they made all these unnecessary changes from the book, though some were tolerable like the mini factory made out of bad toothpaste tops that Charlie had.  In a way it expressed his desire to go to the chocolate factory, but I think if Roald Dahl didn't do it Tim Burton shouldn't either.  Another intolerable unnecessary change was the very sappy ending and all of the flashbacks that Willy Wonka had, these flashbacks showed how he was neglected by his father, that didn't allow him to eat candy. Of course Willy Wonka  ran away, But in the end Willy comes back to his father and then they play the soft \\"touching\\" music for the audience.  Besides all of the changes the movie, it was very funny, entertaining and the children were well done, except I thought augustus gloop's german accent was pretty bad.  The best part of the movie was with the Oompa  <br />Loopas.  They were very entertaining, their songs were well done and Tim tried to make each song a different genre of music like that  Violet Beauregarde had an almost techno song or  Veruca Salt had a country ballad.  In the end the changes had almost butchered the movie but the movie itself was funny, entertaining and at the end you would want a bar of chocolate. <br />I am still going to buy the movie.
0393314804|4.0|Written in a phonetic Scottish-English hybrid, this book is a challenge on the reader and soon bogs down the eye-brain connection  as we sound through words the same way we once did in Sister Mary-Elizabeth's kindergarten class. Although this is not exactly the dead-on same story as the movie of like name, anyone whose seen and loved Trainspotting on screen will be glad to find Renton, Sickboy, Spuds, the sociopathic Francis Begby, clean-living Tommy (and Lizzie!) and all the rest of the gang here in the novel that inspired one of the freshest, grossest and funniest movies of the mid-1990's.<br /><br />For those who do not know, Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting is set in Scotland in roughly contemporary times, and tells the tale of Mark Renton, a twenty-ish philosophical junky and his band of mates, as they run, walk and crawl through a sometimes dismal, sometimes upbeat life in a post-industrial, pre-future society. Among their adventurous efforts to keep themselves in heroin (supplied by a colorful man called Mother Superior--on account of the length of his habit) Renton and the others joyfully rob American tourists, steal TV's from old age homes, and generally push onward through an existence that holds no promise of a tomorrow. Along the way, some extremely strange events come to pass. Renton unexpectedly finds himself with a thoroughly jailbait girlfriend who is roughly thirteen going on thirty; Begby goes on the lam after a violent crime goes bad; and as he passes thru a vicious episode of the DT's, Renton looks on aghast with horror as a dead baby slinks in accusatory fashion over the ceiling above his head.<br /><br />In case you can't guess, this is one strange novel.<br /><br />Trainspotting is worth the effort of dissecting the meaning of the odd, Celtic-flavored words Welsh uses to tell this tale of a crew of heroin-using Scotsmen in a pessimistic society that has seen better days. Like the film version, it's funny, it's imaginative (to say the least) and it's more than a little sick at times. It's a challenge to read, but hey, the road less traveled and all that, right?least) and it's more than a little sick at times.

B000003TA4|1.0|Something tells me that Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, the loathsome Nirvana, and the rest of the genre could have achieved as much musicality if they were playing chainsaws and jackhammers as opposed to musical instruments.  Do you self deluded \\"slackers\\" really think grunge was about honesty and passion?  It was about finding a new way of separating a bunch of gullable, immature fools from their money.  Mission accomplished. <br /> <br />\\"Mosh on dudes!  Duh!\\"
0375757422|3.0|Yep, that's about the only claim to fame of this shallow, eye-batting bit of fluff and nonsense. Needed some sex to spice it up and maybe a few curse words or a little war, courtesy of Napoleon across the Channel. Sex 'n violence, that's the key. I mean couldn't Emma have been ravished a little by one of the courtly fops who paid a call and couldn't she have gouged an eye out with a hairpin or red-hot poker in defense of her virtue? Helllooo,  action and excitement, like Clarissa had a century earlier with Richardson? He knew a thing or two about keeping a bored middle school honors English class going. Yep. It would've helped. I've held a grudge against this insipid it's-somehow-great-because-it's-old bubble-headed tripe since it was forced on me like a bad blind date in the 8th grade. I hated this book. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of lower is that it did have a few redeeming moments and plus anything from another age that gives us a small peek into the lifestyles of the past (even a shallow and vain group of peasant-exploiting petty aristocratic-wanna-bes from the past) is worth something. Oh, plus there was the whole Clueless spin-off thing. Yeah, Clueless was so huge to us in the mid-90's we even used to go, \\"WWAD?\\" (What Would Alicia Do?) So I can't let myself utterly excoriate this headache-inducing, bulimia-inspiring, plot-thin-as-supermodel-tale from the dim brain of Miss Austen, a woman deeply in need of a good love affair. (If you catch what I'm saying.)<br /><br />It mystifies me they managed to make a passable film version out of Emma ten years ago during the Austen craze in Hollywood. If only the book had been that tolerable.<br /><br />All right, Austen fans, slam my review if you want, but all you readers-for-fun out there, those of you I might have saved from a long boring nothing-happens kinda novel: YOU'RE WELCOME!!!!
B000002H2H|5.0|Thank god theese guys were not like soo many other bands whose first album is their best effort.  Some argue \\"Master Of Puppets\\" is the best others say \\"And Justice For All\\".  This album comes in at #3.  Fade To Black and The Call Of KTULU are epic, some of Metallica's best.  Ride The Lightening is a must have for any Metallica fan or just a fan of metal.  I just replaced mine after 9 years of excessive use.  The referance to wine also means bands can go bad(Load, Reload).
B00005JMAH|2.0|Given the effort and hype that comes with \\"special edition\\" DVDs, I just have to make a comment about the Interviews with Johnny Vaughan on the second DVD. But first, for those interested in the movie, it is great - 5 stars. <br />I give the DVD 2 stars because of the Johnny Vaughan. I have rarely ever seen such awful interviews. Just one example: unbelievably, one of the main questions for almost every actor is \\"how many girls\\" (he even uses the offensive term \\"birds\\"...) have you been able to seduce thanks to your fame from the HP films. Even when the boy who plays the Dursley kid states early on that no one recognizes him in the street, Vaughan still asks (maybe even twice if I'm not mistaken) the same stupid, sexist question. (The pathetic attempts at humour using the Shrunken Head are also incredibly annoying.) What a lost opportunity.  <br />This is of course no reason not to by the DVD, but Warner Brothers should be embarrassed.
B00006RIO7|2.0|This is enjoyable, but not nearly as good as the Broadway versions.  1996's cast album with Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking is fabulous (James Naughton is an excellent Billy Flynn).  The Gwen Verdon/Chita Rivera/Jerry Orbach album is also wonderful.  The movie soundtrack does not come close to rivaling either one -- the actors were cast primarily as actors, not singers!  Richard Gere comes off as especially weak.
0887307280|5.0|\\"Working smart, not working had,\\" that's what this book is about.  What does it mean to work smart?  It means to delegate responsibilities and to create a synergistic environment for maximum leverage.  Self employment has its limitation on time, skills, and experience.  True business ownership is what this book is about.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000074FL|4.0|THis album gets canned for not being up to scratch but I would disagree.  The songs on this album are nicely written and diverse in style which is a good thing.  \\"Hollywood\\" is a great rocker and \\"angel of death\\" is foreboding and ominous with great keys from Darren Wharton.  \\"Fats\\" is brilliant and jazzy - \\"check out fats, he's a real cool cat, he's got bright white spats.......\\" .  The song \\"renegade\\" was dissed on the all music guide but I think it's a great song with a real dreamy quality to it.  Please don't overlook this album if you like Lizzy's more experimental side.
B000002H33|2.0|O.K. i'll make it short, but the kid is right, this album has to be one of the most overrated works of music ever released. The songs just drag on WAY too long to the point of bordom, i know that there are some really heavy riffs in the numbers on this platter but that alone does not make a good heavy metal album. C'mon, the songs on this thing are like 8 minutes long a piece (most of them), don't you thing that is a little self indulgent? People like Rush or Iron Maiden can get away with 8+ minutes songs because they keep them fresh and interesting through the whole way, but not Metallica, just dragging out the same redundant riff in a never ending borfest. <br /> <br />The singing on this thing is horrible, Hetfeild has a voice that will start to irritate you after the first 3 minutes, so imaginge how bad it will be in a album that has almost an hour running time. Drumming is very average, not bad, but not particulary good in any way. The bass, well, the only time you can actually hear bass on this is during \\"Orion\\", which is the only redeeming qaulity of this album of elevator music, on any other song, forget it.... how was it that Cliff Burton was so revered for his bass skills when you could not even hear him 90% of the time? The guitar work is average at best, and sleep inducing at it's worst, why the hell is \\"Master Of Puppets\\" even catagorized under \\"Thrash\\"? if it really is thrash, then it is some of the most slow and boring thrash i'v ever listened too in my life. <br /> <br />Pass this overrated P.O.S. up and save youe money for something worth getting. If its thrash you want, i might suggest Exodus's \\"Bonded By Blood\\", Anthrax's \\"Among The Living\\", Accept's \\"Restless and Wild\\" or Sodom's \\"Agent Orange\\", all which are better then this.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|I'd give this 5 stars if only You've Got A Way was on here.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great cd, but the most beautiful song is missing.  From This Moment is just as good, but YGAW is another fantastic song and it was a hit when Notting Hill was a hit, so where is it?  The video was beautiful too.  At least her other boppy songs are here so there is plenty of good listening.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|The only people who should disagree with the above statement are those who were looking forward to the next 'Take them on, on your own.'  Understandable, considering that BRMC's previous album was very good in it's delivery of straightforward rock 'n' roll.  But if the listener can get past this disappointment, then they will realise that they are listening to a better record.  BRMC's albums were, like previously stated, straightforward, but this album is anything but.  It is packed with emotion and energy.  And yes, the other albums did have energy too, but BRMC sound much more confident and natural on 'Howl'.  It's almost seems like this is the music that they were supposed to be writing in the first place.  Give it a shot, listen for yourself, and if you (the BRMC fans out there) can get past the almost inevitable shock and disappointment at the new sound, then you will understand what I mean.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I actually like this show.  Normally I love more dramas and more shows geared for adults, but I have to say that this is actually good.  It's light-hearted and humourous and fun.  Apart from Mischa Bartons bad acting, the rest of the show is good and it doesn't hurt that the main guy is a hunk (Ben McKenzie).  This has a little something for everyone and every taste.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I must say, I was more than surprised when I slapped this album into my CD player.  Not only was it good, but it was VERY good! <br />After the complete failure of 'Think Tank', I thought for certain that Damon Albarn had lost his touch for songwriting (which wouldn't seem that weird considering that most musical artists don't last much longer than ten years).  But all my fears were evaporated; the album IS great.  Some might worry that the album probably sounds a lot different than the original considering that the group has several new members and a new producer/mixer (Danger Mouse).  Fear not, though it does sound different (much less bass in this one), it is still distinctly the Gorillaz sound.  Listen to the 'Intro' track and you'll see what I mean.  It sounds like nothing on the other record and yet it is immediately recognizable as a Gorillaz song.  And the entire record is this way.  With the exception of 'White Light' and 'Don't Get Lost in Heaven', the entire album is solid.  Finally, some great music in 2005, and on a major label at that!
B0000UJDLM|3.0|Short Circuit is great fun for what it is: a campy '80s flick about technology, AI, and \\"living\\" machines. Ally Sheedy does a great job, and the other actors are somewhat decent, but the script could use some real improvement. The special effects are nothing to write home about today, although I remember seeing shows dedicated to the \\"revolutionary\\" motion-capture equipment they used to control Johnny 5. <br /> <br />I enjoy '80s movies overall, even if it's just to laugh at the outdated music, hairdos, and cheesy lines. They're also generally enjoyable because these movies are unmarred by the moody brooding of the movies from the '90s and \\"aughts.\\" Short Circuit, while a light-hearted jaunt through the lenses of the '80s, still remains somewhat mediocre. There are plenty of other great flicks from the decade - \\"Batteries Not Included,\\" for instance - that deal with the same subject matter and are much better films overall.
0790729652|5.0|This live action story of the comic book hero, the caped crusader, is an excellent film by director Tim Burton (Beetle Juice, Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands). Michael Keaton's Batman and Bruce Wayne add interest to what the real Batman is like. But the one steals the show is the brilliantly cast Jack Nicholson who falls into acid and becomes the evil Joker. The Joker is causing psychopathic incidents, such as making news reporters laugh to death. Also staring Kim Basinger as reporter Vicki Vale and Michael Gough as Bruce Wayne's bulter Alfred.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Another great album and great service from the vendor.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I just came back from an advance screening Sin City, and I can tell you this is one salient reel of pitch film. Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most of Frank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment, but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crime writers of the 40's. Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B & W with digital-hued technicolor makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is awesome... I love the background music from Pirates of th Caribbean...awesome CD
B00008EY65|4.0|I heared that Hellboy was off a comic book. Hellboy is near classic of great proportion as played by the underrated Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beast) Perlman is an actor you probley wouldn't recognize as he has had to wear so much facial make up in his career. Also he played in a lot of low budget movies. He imbues 'Hellboy' with a real humanity and a scathing wit. How am I ever gonna get a girl when I drive around in a garbage truck? John Hurt as his father has a little to do but that he loves Hellboy there is no doubt having to rescued him on the night he came from hell. Dr. Broom adopts the boy and they live at the Center For Paranormal Studies in New Jersey with a fish like creature and a fire starter girl who Hellboy loves to pieces.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|There is actually a more \\"legal\\" way to get this album, and all copy protected albums, into iTunes,as opposed to ea-pty's review.  It requires Windows Media Player 9.0 and a CD burner, but it works and doesn't require stopping non-plug and play devices.  Simply go to the website on the label on the CD ([...]) and read the info on how to ask Sony/BMG.  No unnecessary ire about supposed spyware, and no needs to worry yourself about the corporate disagreement on the standard format for protected media files between Apple and Sony/BMG.  If you want to get pissed off about the man, listen to some Rage Against the Machine instead of digging through your device manager. <br /> <br />As far as the album goes, disc 1 rocks, disc 2 isn't my thing but it isn't bad.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Plot: A cyborg from the 2029 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has arrived in the present (which, for the sake of the film, is 1984). In this near future, machines are rising to near domination over humans. The reason he has been sent back in time? To terminate. You see, in this seemingly hopeless future, there will be a man who is capable of leading an army that conquers the machines. The cyborg must terminate the mother of that child -- Sarah Connor. Also sent back in time is the \\"good guy\\" of the story -- Reese. Reese has been sent ot protect Sarah from the cyborg, to be sure the child is eventually born. But, even with Sarah's natural determination to live and Reese's passion for his duty, the incredibly advanced humanoid machine will be one tough cookie to beat! Can they terminate the terminator? Will our future ever be safe from the rise of the machines?<br /><br />A wonderful storyline, a heart-pounding score, great direction by James Cameron, and an overall grim feeling of futuristic mayhem are just a few of the aspects of The Terminator that make it a scifi classic. Is it Schwarzenegger on screen with his mechanical brutality that attracts so many? Or maybe the terrifying ride along with Reese and Sarah trying to escape this madness? Maybe we'll never really know why this is such an amazing movie. Still, time and time again, nothing compares to the darkly action-packed experience of The Terminator forever frozen in time with your DVD copy. You don't really need a reason to love The Terminator, you only need the film itself!
B0000DIXDR|1.0|Tchoh, this is one of those stupid movies that really annoys me. I mean, let's get right down to it - it's RUBBISH, OK? Everyone knows it, yet mention it to a certain demographic of empty-headed girls and they all cluck and sigh and say how much they love it etc. Fools.<br /><br />For the record, The Curmudgeon is not some stony-hearted macho man. Hey, probably my all time favourite movie is Wizard Of Oz. But we're not here to talk about the good stuff, remember (read my profile) - only the bad. And oh man, is this ever bad.<br /><br />It's not the dancing I resent - I don't mind that. It's some of the stupid plot devices that really grate on me, and they're the ones that usually get the girls all gooey and resting their cheeks on their hands.<br /><br />Plot device one - Patrick Swayze blubs at the end of this movie because of all the sex he gets. Yep, he's actually UPSET about the amount of MILFS he manages to pull in the job he has. \\"They just use me\\", he sniffs. OH BOO HOO - Poor you. Sorry, we're supposed to FEEL for this character?  Did those women FORCE him to bang them all? Give me a break.<br /><br />Plot device two - one of the girls gets pregnant sleeping around. Whoops, well, that's what happens. Nothing wrong with a bit of a moral in the tale here and there. But - girl gets abortion, so - abortion girl crys, the lead girl crys, Swayze looks \\"deep\\" - alright. But - NEXT SCENE(!!) Swayze and lead girl are in his house dancing - cue romantic music - cue first kiss - cue sex scene. Yes, nothing like an abortion to get you in the mood for more casual, pre-maritial sex. JUST the sort of thing we want to shove down the throats of the impressionable 12 year old girls watching.<br /><br />\\"Nobody puts baby in the corner\\", quothe old plasticine face at the end. Fair enough - put this crap there instead, and crush it into oblivion.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
B0007Y08QA|5.0|_The Machinist_ is a dark movie which features a man tormented by guilt.  His guilt causes him to suffer from chronic insomnia, to waste away until he is \\"so thin that he doesn't exist\\", and to invent characters in his mind who torment him.  The machinist operates a lathe in a factory and the dark industrial character of his surroundings is really pronounced in the movie.  Initially one suspects a conspiracy among his co-workers after he is involved in an accident which leaves a man armless.  A mysterious figure appears who actively torments the machinist and notes on his refrigerator involving a sinister game of \\"hang-man\\".  The movie is very well done and the ending presents the viewer with a surprise.
B00005JN5X|3.0|While I enjoyed many aspects of this movie (the production design, the lead actors, the score, much of the story), its use of animal violence for \\"humor\\" ruined it for me. If you would be distressed by seeing a rabbit skinned (fake or not, it is graphic), a kitten kicked, and horses with their tails on fire, you may want to avoid this one.
B000059Z8J|5.0|I was 15 when \\"Superman\\" premiered during the holiday season of 1978.  I remember seeing it the first day at an old movie palace in downtown Philly that probably seated a couple thousand people and had a couple balconies.  The lines were around the block and I don't think there was an empty seat in the house.  From the film's opening credits and rousing theme by John Williams I was hooked.  Some 27 years later the film has lost none of it's magic.  The makers of the film deliberately take their time in exprapolating the genesis of the Superman legend before engaging us in his adventures.  Christopher Reeve was perfect as Superman, combining both the athleticism of the character with boyish affability.  He's equally fine at projecting the goofy awkwardness of his alter ego, Clark Kent.  Margot Kidder has a superb comic touch as the go-getting Lois Lane for the 1970's.  Though Lex Luthor seems more comical than menacing, Gene Hackman is effective in his portrayal.  The effects even in this CGI generation still work in particualarly the scenes of Superman in flight and the San Andreas fault sequences.  The additional scenes that have been included, particularly the ones involving Marlon Brando as Jorel, Superman's father, flesh out the story and do not seem superfluous.  I know they have been talking about reviving the franchise again but I'm hardpressed to think they can top this film.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|For this movie, Gerard should be named sexiest man alive, 2005.  He plays the intense, self-destructive and fatally passionate phantom for his Christine (Emmy Rossum).  Check out the sizzling scene with the song \\"Point of no return\\". <br /> <br />The movie had me shedding hot tears for the spectacle and strong emotions of a dangerous man scorned--a man who later suffers no consequences for his crimes of murder in the theatre (having been hardened since childhood days by his tormentors who beat him for having a disfigurement).  Except! his karmalike punishment of never having the affection of the only woman he ever loved.  <br /> <br />The reality of his merciless murders solidify Christine's decision not to be with him.  That and of couse his hideous demi-face and his over-enthusiasm to force her to be his bride too soon. Incidentally the half of his face you can see with the mask on, he's green eyed and beatiful.  <br /> <br />This lovestory is irrational and over the top--a gorgeous fantasy with a dangerous anti-hero who pays in the end with a broken heart and an eternal longing for the woman he will never attain.  For the period in which it is set, it's a typical shallow moral, telling a lot about the society at the time:  Ugly on the outside means ugly on the inside too.
B000000WA4|5.0|I was a mere 10 years old when this hit the market.  It was a stage when I was still extensively listening to country (did I really buy all those Garth Brooks CDs?)  So, lucky for me, I missed the grand \\"play out\\" stage of this album.  Lucky for me.  I bought it in 1998 and became and instant and loyal listener, both to this album and the pumpkins as a whole.  Now it's 2005, and if anything, I love it more.  In fact, either this or Counting Crows' \\"August And Everything After\\" may be my favorite album of all time.  And that says a lot.  I listen to anything from the Beatles' \\"Abby Road\\" to Green Day's \\"American Idiot.\\"  As a previous reviewer mentioned, this double disc has a lot in common with the Beatles' \\"White Album,\\" not so much as in the way the songs sound, but just how they flow and are arranged.  So, w/out further adew, here is the breakdown of the songs: <br /> <br />DISK ONE: Dawn to dusk <br />1.Title Track-I might have picked more of a rocker for a beginning, but this is still a beautiful, instrumental piano opening.  <br />2.Tonight, Tonight-Everyone who remembers the 90s remembers this.  It's a mainstreem radio-friendly award-winning song that is actually good! <br />3.Jellybelly-The opening is a little messed up, and it's a typical pumpkins \\"fuzzed out\\" rocker.  Not my fav but I listen to it. <br />4.Zero-big hit for it's time, inspired the \\"zero\\" pumpkins t-shirts.  Never cared much for this t-shirt, but this song kicks a**! <br />5.Here is no why-No idea how they got the title for this.  nevertheless, this has always been a favorite.  The analogy about \\"sad machines\\" speaks to me, in a way <br />6.Bullet W/ Butterfly Wings-Classic.  Need I say more? <br />7.To Forgive-Meh.  Not the most interesting song on the album, but it's listenable. <br />8. Ode 2 No-one- or F--- You, as it is sometimes refered to as.  The lyrics are a bit cheezy (corgan was obviously pissed as hell about a former love) but fits well as one of the album's heavier rockers. <br/>9.Love-Listen to this song on headphones and you'll feel really tripped out.  I think Corgan's idea was to musically recreated this dizzy in-love-for-the-first-time feeling.  Always loved this one. <br />10.Cupid De Locke-Took me a bit to understand this one.  It's not really \\"teenager\\" but now that I'm almost 22, I recognize that this is living proof that Pumpkins can be satanic or sweet. <br />11.Galapagos-BEAUTIFUL more mellow piece about change and nostaligia.  Reminds me of my past summers in MI <br />12.Muzzle-Another hit from the album, I always loved the lyrics to this one.  It not too heavy, not too soft.  One  of my favs. <br />13.Porcelina of the vast oceans-This should have gotten playtime on the radio, all the way!  It's classic.  I do wonder how they came up with porcelina, though.  Sounds like a toilet. <br />14.Take Me Down-James Iha-penned slower song to finish off the first half of the show.  I usually skip this one.  They should just let Corgan write the songs. <br /> <br />Disk 2:Twilight To Starlight <br />1.Where Boys Fear To Tread-Complete Hard Rockin' redemption from the first disk's poor closing.  The band I used to be in jammed on this song sometimes.  Always been a fav. <br />2.Bodies-Another Fav, same rocking vein as the previous.  I remember wondering what was going on between this song and the last.  I thought something was wrong with my cd player.  How creative! <br />3.33-Another hit song.  Well written, deep, and a good calmer tune after the previous two. <br />4. In the arms of sleep-If the pumpkins would have made an mtv unplugged (with they should have!), this would have been on it.  Great guitar work, and overall, great song. <br />5.1979-classic hit song and one of my favorite sp songs ever <br />6.Tales Of A Scorched Earth-can almost feel the heat of it happening too.  The pumpkins rip your face off after three slower songs.  Rock on! <br />7.Through The Eyes Of Ruby-This is a really poetic alternative song, followed by a reprise of the title track at the end.  This is a friend of mine's favorite sp song.  It's not mine but it's fab! <br />8.Stumbeline-I play this on my guitar sometimes.  This is prolly the best from Corgan's solo acoustic catalog.  \\"Jupiter's Lament,\\" which prolly got bumped by this one, isn't nearly as good. <br />9.XYU-Jeeze!  I would really like to know where Corgan got this title idea AND the lyrics!  This giant rocker makes Korn sound like sesame st. music. <br />10.We Only Come Out @ Night-A song about bats.  And who better to write a song about bats than the pumpkins.  This is one of the reasons I say that this has similarities with the \\"White Album\\" <br />11. Beautiful-Title says it.  I'll save the wearNtear on my keyboard. <br />12. Lily, My 1 + Only-This track is genious, and is another potential radio-hit.  It's a slower song about a guy who climbs a tree and watches his crush through her window. <br />13.By Starlight-Straight forward and clean, this could have been from a U2 session.  Good sound. <br />14.Farewell and goodnight-\\"The White Album\\" ended with a track with a similar title.  That song is kinda tacky, while this ending is perfection.  Nicely done, pumpkins! <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins are one of the 90's best bands, the this album is the reason why.  How can u go wrong?
B00005AAEC|5.0|I love this movie. It is refreshingly upbeat and light hearted. My daughters dance to the perry como music in it. I had to do some research but I found all the albums of perry como that contain the music in this movie. I love the character Calvin Webber. He is so nutty that it is funny to watch him and his ways. Helen is a nurturing mother who feels the same way as any normal person would who was forced to live underground for 35 years. Check out her breakdown at Adam's birthday party. Adam reminds me of Wally Cleaver. You know the perfect gentleman. Eve is like any red blooded American girl and her friend well I think we all know someone like him. I highly recommend this movie to any fan of the retro scene.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Imagine a movie with the over the top action stylings of a Jackie Chan film but a funnier script.  No, scratch that; how about a clever martial arts cartoon fleshed out with live action and a little CGI?  As soon as I saw this I realized that I've been unconsciously yearning for this weird combination of the ridiculous and the impressive. Kung Fu Hustle is long overdue. <br /> <br />Kung Fu Hustle is a bona fide comedy.  It has an original plot, action, and jokes that don't reference any other particular movie.  What's more, it would seem that filmmakers have finally discovered how to use CGI to simulate cartoon action in a live action movie (who even knew that would ever  be called for? And yet...).  This is an entirely new category of martial arts film, deserving of its own evaluation apart from spoofs like Kung Pow.   <br /> <br />The story is basically the universal archetype of poor people being oppressed by a powerful but corrupt man, and an unlikely hero emerging out of nowhere to save the day.  That much is old hat, I will admit.  And I'm not sure that I'd go so far as to say that the entire film is good, because it does drag on in spots.  On the whole, though, I found myself enjoying it and being continually surprised by the irreverent tone, the sometimes silly humor and the very entertaining fight scenes.   <br /> <br />If you like your kung fu movies straight and serious, this one might seem silly.  But I think that's its odd charm, so I will give it a solid four stars and call it a good pick for a contrarian in a lighter mood.  If that's you, then you're probably a Warner Bros. fan, too and you will be able to appreciate Kung Fu Hustle. <br />-Andrea, aka merribelle <br />
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This series is so welcoming that after the first episode you feel like you're one of the town's folk. Watching Lorelai and Rory learn and grow from each other's mistakes in a little town called Stars Hollow is just simply alluring. After catching the season's premiere on TV sometime back I immediately became a fan, waiting for a new episode every week. A mixture of witty scripting and smart smack on your face dialogue, this show captures life in both hands and spreads it all over a wide array of endearing characters.<br /><br />Gilmore Girls is a show about dreams, about hope, about being lost and found at the same time. Extremely well written in so many levels...just leaves you with something charming to say. It's just simply exceptional that this series is released on DVD.
B000A7S4B0|2.0|The BRMC have always been the type of band you throw on the car deck while smoking a cigarette with the volume turned up, while wearing an angst, pissed at the world type grimace on your face. Well, I'm not going to say this album is horrible, it isn't...and I am all for the BRMC attempting to create new sounds and what not, but the departure here from the BRMC's excellent amtomspheric riffage to gospel-ish blues with a lil too much glass on the production end of these Miss. Delta Blues wannabe cuts just do not suffice. The BRMC are always being compared to Jesus and Mary Chain, and being a huge fan of both bands im sick of that cop out comparsison, which does not do either band justice. But back in 1986 (I believe) J&MC released their best effort \\"Darklands,\\" essentially an all acoustic (or as acoustic as they ever got) album that still held the grit and weight that J&MC dished out. BRMC's album however disappoints and it does so, not because its blues inspired and/or acoustic (see \\"Tonight It's You\\" on one of their EPs or singles from \\"BRMC\\" era) because they've recorded tracks that are great acoustic numbers, it's just on \\"Howl\\" they lack the same weight and heft that the BRMC normally has delivered (at least in their passed two albums and misc. bsides). I thought there was a definite departure in attitude and tone from \\"BRMC\\" to \\"Take Them..\\" but the deapture in sound isnt the problem with \\"Howl\\" its just its not executed as well.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|The audio quality of this CD easily beats the previous champ, the vinyl Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs 1/2 speed master. It mops up the floor with the standard CD issue and discards the filth in the wastebasket. It has nothing to do with being \\"louder\\" as one hapless reviewer states. The original CD was pinched, colored, and distressed. <br /> <br />\\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" is classic Dylan of course and little need be said about the superb quality of the performances and the songs. <br /> <br />This CD also contains a few previously unpublished photos from the recording sessions. <br /> <br />Although the booklet doesn't say so, I believe this was DSD mastered. Steve Berkowitz, also uncredited on this remaster, is in charge of the overall remastering of Dylan's catalog. He deserves a lot of thanks.
B000A7S4B0|2.0|The BRMC have always been the type of band you throw on the car deck while smoking a cigarette with the volume turned up, while wearing an angst, pissed at the world type grimace on your face. Well, I'm not going to say this album is horrible, it isn't...and I am all for the BRMC attempting to create new sounds and what not, but the departure here from the BRMC's excellent amtomspheric riffage to gospel-ish blues with a lil too much glass on the production end of these Miss. Delta Blues wannabe cuts just do not suffice. The BRMC are always being compared to Jesus and Mary Chain, and being a huge fan of both bands im sick of that cop out comparsison, which does not do either band justice.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|I never really expected to like this film. But after seeing it on Cinamax, I was surprised that I loved it. The movie is pretty pointless but it's still pretty funny and often even heart-felt. Roger Ebert claimed that the movie made no attempt to make Napoleon likeable. Well that's totally wrong. He can be a jerk but he also does some good things in the movie. When a kid gets bullied and picked on in school, he offers him protection from his friend Padro's big cousins. When Padro is running for president and doesn't know he's supposed to do a dance number. Napoleon dances for the audience instead. So what's not likeable about that. If he wasn't likeable then why would so many people love this movie and love the character.<br /><br />  What makes the movie pointless is that it just ends basically and basically just lives with no plot. His annoying uncle moves in after Napoleon's Grandma has an accident. He hands out flyers to women telling them he can help them get bigger boobs. Which makes people laugh at Napoleon more than they do already. So he wants to get rid of his uncle but he won't leave. Does his uncle ever actually leave ? I'm not even sure. But I can forgive a movie this fun and a hilarious for not really leading anywhere. All the characters are original and funny and they're well played by the actors as well. The best scene is when Napoleon and his brother think they actually own a time machine that will send them back to the past. They just casually try it out like owning a time machine would be normal or possible. I also like the scene where his uncle shows off his throwing arm by hitting Napoleon in the head with a rock lol.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I watched the show and fell in love with the music.  The CD is exactly the music from the show, hence it was exactly what I wanted.  All the songs are great, and I've been listening to it for a month straight.  I really love Good Lighter and Wander My Friends.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00005OM4N|1.0|I can confidently state that this is one of the worst albums ever put to tape.I mean who in their sanity would want to buy albums from a fake who does not write her own songs, brazenlylip synchs in front of millions and dresses up like a slut.Songs like I am a slave 4 you make me feel like throwing up in disgust.NO DONT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS CRAP.Get something nice like OBSCURED BY CLOUDS from PINK FLOYD instead.

B000000H5K|4.0|with some REALLY heavy parts. tracks like dusted , cut throat,and attitude.  Lookaway is a perfect example of eirey sounding tribal sounds really dark and heavy. the whole cd is good enough to play without skippin songs

B000002LEM|5.0|When David Lee Roth left Van Halen (Or they fired him, whatever) everything changed, the music, the rhythm, the looks, etc, but not only for Van Halen, almost for every band happened the same. Casually, the second part of the 80's for everybody was like a radical change. All the great groups had to include at least one ballad on every album (KISS, CHEAP TRICK, ALICE COOPER, MOTLEY CRUE, ETC, ETC and a long ETC) Most of the great big bands were crucified by their fans and most of the time with good reasons. Not with Van Halen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OK everything had changed in the band without DLR but it was for good, although they were experiencing with pop and keyboards and all that but they did it with a classy touch. Not everyone could do that.<br /><br />On this one, I had my doubts after 5150 (Not that it was a bad CD) but they pretty much convince me after the second listen. Almost the whole CD is no less than great. Eddie is very sharp and precise on the guitar, Alex got rid of most of the effects he used on 5150, Mike is great and Sammy's voices are perfectly matching with the rest of the guys (very hard for a new singer).<br /><br />You have perfect rockers = Mine All Mine, Source Of Infection, Sucker In 3 Piece. A.F.U.,<br /><br />You have the great ballad *OF COURSE* = When it's Love (I might say one of the greatest ballads of the time).<br /><br />You have the radio-friendly-catchy songs = Black And Blue, Cabo Wabo, Feels So Good, Finished What You Started.<br /><br />You have (if not enough) a little blues song = A Apolitical Blues (Which probably was Hagar idea).<br /><br />I think on this one is were the guys are finally melting as a band and starting to have fun everytime they play. VAN HALEN recovered the respect they had with the fans just because they started to play great simple songs.  The best is yet to come but they make an outstanding effort on this CD.  I'm pretty sure that a lot of Roth fans didn't like this change but I can bet that at least they kept the respect for the band, something that not a lot of bands did.<br /><br />All in all, this CD is from the end of a very soft era. So it's perfect if you are not thinking in Fair Warning or Van Halen I.<br /><br />Highlight: Mine All Mine, When It's Love, Cabo Wabo.<br /><br />Lowlight: A Apolitical Blues.the respect for the band, something that not a lot of bands did. <br /> <br />All in all, this CD is from the end of a very soft era.

B000A88F22|5.0|I'M SO SICK OF PEOPLE DUMPING ON BRITNEY ITEMS AND GIVING THEM LOW RATINGS JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE HER. IF YOU DON'T BUY THIS, OR DON'T PLAN ON BUYING THIS, DON'T REVIEW IT!!! WE DON'T GIVE A RAT'S A** WHAT YOU JEALOUS PEOPLE SAY!!!!!!!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|This is my first Coldplay cd purchase, but definitely not my last, as I adore most every song.  I highly recommend this cd for anyone who is contemplating purchase, because both the singer and the music are excellent--they are great complements to each other.
B000069HKH|4.0|In one of his greatest records in the E Street vein, Bruce Springsteen makes a record that deals with the real life horrors in his backyard, and at the same times does not over or understate the issue.  Springsteen gives a picture of pain, joy, confusion and deliverance that is still relevant a few years after 9/11. <br /> <br />Brendan O'Brien does a great job of giving a full and almost lush sound to this album, accentuating the musicianship of the Boss and company.  \\"Lonesome Day\\" opens it up, delivering one of the stronger tracks on the record.  \\"Into The Fire\\" gives an incredible visual of running into the blaze whether it be a burning building or life itself.  \\"Nothing Man\\" is a minimalist gem that really grows on you after a while.     <br /> <br />The last part of \\"Rising\\" really sticks out with the best overall tracks.  \\"The Fuse\\" lands as the best song of this CD, giving the listener (at least this one) visuals of the closing of an Indian Summer day.  \\"You're Missing\\" is one of the more beautiful songs Springsteen has done in a bit, making the sense of loss much more tangible.  A trio of great songs, \\"The Rising\\", \\"Paradise\\" and the soulful \\"My City Of Ruins\\" closes out this memorable set.   <br /> <br />Only a few out of place tracks take this album down to a 4.  Whether you are a fan or not, grab it.
B00008PW2D|5.0|Definitely much better than Season 5....More episodes, great story lines, and the best clothing of all the seasons.
B00079FUI6|3.0|I was never a fan of this series, however, i was well aware of all the plots twists and back stories throught out the whole season thanks to seeing an episode once in a while and the constant talking of other people about this show. However i must admitt that the beggining was well done and actually pretty funny..most of the situations in the first half didn't fail to crack a laugh, and the introduction of a \\"suspense\\" and mystery story was a big plus, the characters were well chosen and the acting was not so bad. Then...desperation from someone making the show just blew it. Come on! it's impossible to deny that the show lost strenght as it went on and it lost everything that made it what it was in the beginning...funny situations were becoming rare and suddenly not so funny..characters began being non-believable and the \\"mystery\\" became predictable. Before you knew it the show had turned into one really really overrated soap-opera. This however was not the only kink..golden globe to teri hatcher?!?!? B.S. ,anyone can see that any of the other housewives nominated had more complex chcaracters with more complex situations that required much better acting. Anyhow...the show is far from being trash, but it can't get a higher grade, plus...most of the funny situations work about once..maybe twice, surely not enough if you buy the set and watch it over and over again. And personally..i really think that most of the people that \\"love\\" this show are those who have those kind of desperate situations shown in the series.So, if you enjoy the reflection of really common housewives problems mixed with a dash of suspense and a tiny bit of comedy (yeah, i guess this is what is shown less in the show) go ahed and buy this product..otherwise, don't bother
0515123447|5.0|THIS IS THE SECOND BOOK I HAVE READ BY LEE CHILD.  I WAS TOTALLY CAPTIVATED BY THE FIRST AND WANTED MORE.  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE \\"DIE TRYING\\" IF YOU HAVE IT IN STOCK.  THANKS  KAY PARNELL
0439679958|2.0|Yes, it was a page-turner. Horowitz knows how to make you care about the character.  But be warned this is a horror novel with plenty of occult trappings. People are killed in grisly ways, there's an upside down cross, a black mass, the Lord's prayer recited backwards, child sacrifice. This is more than we're used to from this author.
B00005JN5X|1.0|The Brothers Grimm was generally without plot, cruel to children and small animals, gory without cause and just plain stupid.  The acting from the main charaters was fine, but the rest of the cast was terrible.  In the end, neither of them get the girl and the evil queen doesn't die.  Please don't take your children to see this movie!!!!!
0375703764|1.0|This book is divided into two story lines which have been integrated.<br />First, there is the story about a house which expands and shrinks with no apparent reason (the author provides no explanation for this illogical transformation at all).  The characters in the house explore the ever expanding and changing part of the house and though each exploration is short, long documentary types of explanation and analysis are given by an enormous amount of imaginative scholars.<br />To give this book a sense of complication and a different twist, a second part of a story line has been incorporated.  This part is about a  man reading the first story line and becoming psychologically disturbed by it.<br />I had some expectations for this book and support the experimental spirit of the author.  However, the long sophisticated documentaries of a few pointless, unexplained explorations of a house and the ever deteriorating words coming from a confused narrative was not interesting at all.  This book has tricked the reader's precious time by keeping the storyline complicated; yet it is pointless and plotless and no explanation or ending are ever given.<br />It is one of the worst book I have ever read.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Megadeth,original,original band.This is the first album with Marty Friedman(guitar)and Nick Menza(drums).Awesome lyrics on this album. <br />Holy Wars...read the lyrics, <br />Hangar 18 is about area 51. <br />Tornado Of Souls just rules,this album is awesome,the lyrics are well thought out and the riffs are amazing. <br />A lot of people think Megadeth's old stuff is thrash,it's not it's speed metal.Rust In Peace is more thrashier but still speed metal.
B000002JSN|5.0|To whomever says Led Zeppelin is \\"overrated\\", what have you been listening to? I find that a lot of the people that claim they don't like Zep aren't familiar with them. How anybody can dislike like this cd is beyond me.    Anyway, back to the review. Physical Graffiti is a great album, \\"Ten Years Gone\\" is the first song I'd ever heard from Zep. I was little at the time, but it still hit me like a pile of bricks; I had to find out more about that band.     These are all wonderful songs. They aren't the formulated, tired lyrics written by mainstream songwriters today. This brings me back to a time where bands wrote their own music and lyrics. I can see it meant something back then. It wasn't just a paycheck, it wasn't just aimed at one specific age group, this is something everyone can enjoy.    The music goes deep as do the lyrics. Some of my personal favorites on this cd are \\"Sick Again,\\" \\"Black Country Woman,\\" \\"In the Light,\\" and \\"Boogie With Stu,\\" though they are ALL good in their own unique way.     It is obvious of Zep's influence today, the ugliest one being Puff Daddy, P.Diddy, or whatever he wants to be called's sampling of \\"Kashmir.\\" It's unfortunate that some kids grew up thinking that it was Puff Daddy who was the genius to come up with those powerful chords.    Anyway, \\"Houses of the Holy\\" is contagious. The more I hear it, I find out I like it more and more. Go out and get it.
B0001D0FTW|1.0|This band is one of the worst power metal bands I have ever heard,SUCKS.The singer's voice is so annoying(he's a whiner).Not one good song on this crapy album.  Here are some of the worst power metal bands I have ever heard-  Edguy  Rhapsody  Sonata Arctica  Stratovarius  Eternal Reign   Helloween  Thunderstone  Dragonforce  Secret Sphere  Angra  Lost Horizon  Kamelot  Vision Divine(the solo's are amazing though,Olaf Thorsen)  Black Majesty  Skylark
B000002J0B|5.0|This has some of my favorite Zep songs on it, \\"No Quarter\\" being one of them. It's different from a lot of their songs, but stands out in a good way. Jimmy Page also produced this, which is impressive.  In general, it's more laid back then their other albums, but at the same time excellent in every way. \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" kind of has the ska, island-ish vibe about it. It's totally original. \\"The Ocean\\" is a catchy one, it even has an a capella part, \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is another classic. This cd is overall fantastic and diverse. add it to your wish list if you haven't got it already!
B000002IOJ|5.0|(Wow)great thrash album.Of course the solo's are awesome,Alex Skolnick(shredder),good guitar riffs by Eric Peterson,Chuck Billy's voice is great,Louie clemente(drums)and Greg Christian(bass). <br />This is Testament's third release,Practice What You Preach an awesome,awesome song.I don't Like Confusion Fusion but you listen and you decide. <br />My favorite song's on the album are Practice What You Preach,Sins Of Omission,The Ballad(great)and Nightmare(Coming Back To You). <br />The rest of the song's are awesome to(of course).
B000002J03|5.0|If you think about Led Zeppelin II, it has on it some songs that most people define Zep by. There will always be those that are somehow disappointed by the direction the band's music has explored compared to \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and \\"What Is And What Should Never Be.\\" It had to be somewhat annoying to the band that they were asked to play these songs for their shows years after they were popular when they wanted to play newer material. These songs will always be classics, there's no denying that, but Zep couldn't have kept turning out \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"-esque songs like people wanted them to. Their eclectic growth and adding elements of folk, blues, and other genres of music into the mix made them an even better band. This cd is a necessity to any music lover.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This is a good remaster.During the making(original)of this album is when Dave was hardcore into drinking and doing drugs.In My Darkest Hour is my favorite song on the album,it's about Dave Mustaine.502 and Liar are awesome speed metal songs, the cover of Anarchy In The U.K. is much better by Megadeth.This album is just amazing.One of the first metal bands I ever got into.Trust me you will like this album.To me Dave's voice sounds the best on this album.
0802130208|1.0|I read reviews of this book that said it was funny, so I decided to give it a try. I didn't find it amusing at all, a lot of the jokes were about Ignatius' \\"valve\\". I don't think six year old musings about gases and other bodily fluids particularly entertaining. Ignatius is a one-of-a-kind character, but rather irritating. He's always complaining about something. I'd suggest A Prayer For Owen Meany instead of this book, but who knows? You might enjoy it *if* you have that kind of humor.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|First of all, I haven't read the comics at all, so I don't know how it matches up to those.  Nonetheless, this is one of my favorite movies.<br /><br />It has action, drama, even a little romance plus great characters (acted well, too) and some far-out cultish creatures, symbols, and history.  It's just one of those movies that is so in-depth you can really see this other world the author (of the comic) and directors have created.<br /><br />Definietly worth watching again and again.  As for the extras, the second disk is very good, especially the part on \\"Constantine Cosmology\\" (I enjoyed because Constantine is related to the Hero Cycle of Joseph Campbell, if you are familiar as I am in my learning of mythology).  The comic is just the first one, and not the entire series, and interesting to see.
B000002J1U|4.0|I know after this album, critics said Led Zep were losing it. How wrong they were. This cd isn't as commercial as some would hope it to be, but that does NOT mean it isn't good music. Now, \\"Immigrant Song\\" is known to some as \\"that song in car commercials,\\" which really is quite sad. Who other than Robert Plant has the pipes to sing that famous intro? No one I know of. \\"Gallows Pole\\" didn't see a fraction of the attention as \\"Immigrant Song,\\" though it is brilliant. \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is a bluesy number, I can't imagine anyone wouldn't be able to recognize it. \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" is great, I love the lyrics -    When you're old and your eyes are dim,  There ain't no old Shep gonna happen again,  We'll still go walking down country lanes,  I'll sing the same old songs,  Hear me call your name.    This cd is another one to add to the collection. It's amazing, though wasn't as successful as their other cds.
B00000373U|5.0|This CD is an incredible treasure.  As a woman, I was blown away by Elliot's gentle, mesmerizing, sexy and yet curiously comforting voice.  As a musician, I was dazzled by his sense of melody, lyricism (reminiscent of James Joyce's stream of consciousness writing), and orchestration in songs like \\"The Ballade of Big Nothing,\\" \\"Alameda,\\" and \\"No Name No.5.\\"  He is now my favorite male singer-songwriter of all time (and I never had one before him).  Though he struggled with life very hard, God made him an arist, and he expressed depths of emotions and inner conflicts for which most people and musicians can't find words, much less express them with such tenderness as he does.  This tough tenderness transcends anything dark about his music.
B000003C4K|5.0|Classic Thrash Metal album, great riffs, insane vocals, all in all, I rate this CD above \\"Kill 'Em All\\" which is a pretty high rating for myself, I just think this has more to offer, the riffing is catchy as hell, it's insane, Baloffs vocals are crazy, and every song is a perfect length, not to long, not to short, it was the bands debate, but you wouldn't know it, a great album, one of my favs, though Baloff left after this album, Exodus still made great Thrash after with vocalist Steve \\"Zetro\\" Souza, the production is perfect for a Thrash album, it's fast, it's furious, it's crazy, it's THRASH, the best songs are ALL...yes ALL, not one bad song on here, that's how good it is, just listen to \\"Deliver us to Evil\\" WHOA, how many riffs are in that song, buy this album today.
0060763280|4.0|Author Harv Eker hits the nail on the head with his theory that our deep-seeded emotional feelings about money are the blueprint for our day-to-day actions concerning money.  For those who have a naturally healthy perspective about acquiring wealth, the book may seem shallow, but for those of us who were brought up to believe that wealthy people were immoral and greedy, Eker's insights and revelations are a deep, nerve-twanging catalyst for change. <br /> <br />Some of Eker's mantras talk about the Universe as though it were a conscious entity ready to reward those who display the proper intentions.  It's New Age crap, but doesn't get in the way of his overall message. <br /> <br />If you aren't living up to your financial potential, you owe it to yourself to read this book. <br /> <br />A. Keck <br />
B000000H3Z|4.0|This is a landmark thrash album. It comes a bit late in the genre, but it's better than any Slayer that I've ever heard and it's almost up there with early Metallica and Megadeth. The only problem with this album is that sometimes Max's vocals go way off beat with the music behind him. It's not just that it goes slower, I don't mind that, but that it goes just plain off beat.  <br />But that's the only flaw. The riffs are tight, the leads are scorching, blazing roads of fury... it's all great. My personal favorite of this album is \\"Stronger than Hate\\". Brilliant metal album, Sepultura do not get the credit they deserve.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|The best feature of this 2 disc collection is the 2nd CD, giving a very informative history on the painstaking work involved in bringing the novel to life. Those viewers familiar with the original London and Broadway cast, and the perfection of Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman, will be disappointed. One cannot divide The Phantom into separate entities - play and/or movie: the movie should have been as powerful musically as the theatre production, and it is not. Visually, the movie is a stunning production, but it fails in what should be its greatest draw - performers whose powerful and beautiful voices can deliver the power and beauty of the musical score.
0345350499|5.0|The tales of King Arthur and his kingdom are a hundred fold and Marion Bradley pulls them all together into the enjoyable and fascinating work of the Mists of Avalon. The ancient and enchanted land of Avalon is falling into the mists and the resident priestesses of Avalon are determined to save it by using their special gift of Sight and casting the fates in advantage of their beautiful land. King Arthur himself is a product of their work and Morgaine of the Fairies is both a victim and a priestess herself. As the story progresses, characters of legend, like Arthur and Morgaine, are developed into personalities with fresh perspectives and views.  Those personalities draw you in, as a mere character never could. For instance, everyone knows the tragic love story of Lancelet, Arthur's best knight, and Gwenhyfar, Arthur's Queen, but its poignancy becomes all the more accentuated when their respective passions are felt by them as people that we have come to know. Now, while some are not brought to emotional brinks by the several impossible loves entwined in this story, so varied is the plot that this enthralling novel can draw in any reader, no matter their tastes. Along with the love there is action as Arthur tries to drive out the Saxons from Britain and certain characters resort to murder to get what they want. Adventure creeps in when throngs of Arthur's knights go on a holy pilgrimage. Lastly and predominantly there are the legends brought to life in their struggle to settle the fates the right way. Throughout this ever-changing plot we learn much about the similarities between then and now. Where there is religion there is conflict. Where there is love there is jealousy. Where there is trust there is betrayal.
0375714669|5.0|Marjane Satrapi has an interesting life story to tell, and she does it very well here in the under-appreciated graphic strip format. Satrapi was born to a progressive family in Iran, and when she was a teenager during Iran's Islamic Revolution, her parents sent her off to school in Europe, where there were certainly better life choices for a young woman. Here Satrapi illustrates her travails in Europe as a foreigner from an unpopular country, followed by her return to Iran where she was then treated with suspicion for having too many free thoughts and Western tendencies. Satrapi's, artistic style is simplistic and pretty understated technically, though she is excellent at capturing facial expressions, and her style is perfectly suited for focusing the reader's attention on the story. The narrative here does slip into moping and melodrama in places, though Satrapi's coverage of how a free-thinking young person can be oppressed by culture, religion, war, and prejudice is stirring and evocative. Unlike many memoirs from boring people with typical lives, Satrapi's story is very unique and deserves to be told. [~doomsdayer520~]
B0009S4IHY|5.0|While I was watching and thoroughly enjoying Stephen Chow's film \\"Gong fu\\" (\\"Kung Fu Hustle\\"), I was also trying to think of the best cinematic reference point that would succinctly explain what is really going on beyond what we see on screen. That would be Pig Sty Alley, a slum in Shanghai that is run by a landlady (Qiu Yuenm who I defy any viewer to recognize from \\"The Man With the Golden Gun\\") who does absolutely everything with a cigarette dangling from her lips. There are gang wars going on all around them, but the Axe Gang, the biggest and baddest bunch around, ignore Pig Sty Alley because there is no money to be made there. This is just as well because if anybody causes trouble in that neighborhood it turns out that there are not one, or two, or even three, but four kung fun masters. This is discovered by Sing (Chow), a would-be gangster who figures he can impress the Axe Gang by what he does in Pig Sty Alley. But things go very poorly for him and his would be employers visit to clean up his mess. This precipitates a great deal of martial arts action.<br /><br />At the height of the action in this 2004 film it suddenly hit me that the movie it most reminded me of was \\"The Princess Bride.\\" The key commonality between the two is the inherent sense of joy that infuses both films. This is not a spoof in the \\"Airplane!\\" tradition, but more of a humorous homage along the lines of \\"A Mighty Wind,\\" where you have to get it right at the same time you are making your comic points. You might be able to reduce \\"Gong fu\\" down to a combination of karate and slapstick, but you have to grant that Chow has to get both parts right, which is why this works. The comedy is integrated as well as the wirework, which is why I found this film so utterly enjoyable.

0895260131|4.0|At the outset, let me state that I do not consider myself to be any type of expert on Islam or the Crusades.  I know very little about either subject.  Accordingly, I express no opinion on whether Spencer's book is factually accurate in its portrayal of Islam and the Crusades. <br /> <br />That said, my take on this book--which is, I think, borne out by Spencer's own comments--is that this book is intended to provoke dialogue on a very fundamental issue, namely: are the bin Ladens and Zarqawis of the world distorting the teachings of a peaceful prophet and a religion the very name of which is \\"Peace\\"?  I think it's fair to say that this is what most of us have been led to believe by most of the public commentators on Islam, the most visible of whom is our own Commander-in-Chief. <br /> <br />If this is, indeed, a book intended to promote discussion on this issue, it doesn't seem to me to be a valid criticism to say that Spencer isn't fluent in Arabic or that he has never practiced Islam.  As far as I'm aware, Condoleeza Rice has never joined any Communist Party.  Is she, then, automatically disqualified from commenting on communism?  Similarly, most psychiatrists have never suffered from dementia.  Are they therefore disqualified from commenting on it?  Can I write a book about Jim Jones if I didn't drink the Kool-Aid? <br /> <br />Assuming this aim of the book, it doesn't seem a valid criticism to assert that Spencer cherry-picks facts and violence-inspiring quotations from the Koran while ignoring violent portions of the Bible.  Spencer didn't write \\"The Encyclopedia of Islam\\" or \\"The Politically-Incorrect Guide to Jesus.\\"   <br /> <br />Going just from the title of the book, a reader should reasonably expect to read a dissertation focused on uncomfortable facts about the subject at hand, many of which are worthy of a more thorough discussion than we're currently getting from our public discourse.  A reader expecting that from this book will not be disappointed.
1416500219|5.0|\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is assured a place in the history of horror fiction because it the literary classic that represents the archetype of the werewolf (the human with the hiding inside). Along with Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" (the Thing Without a Name) and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" (the Vampire) Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is part of the gothic foundation of the modern horror story. All have in common the fact that they promise to tell a story that might best be left untold, which, of course, is exactly the sort of story we want to hear.<br /><br />Given that Stevenson was writing when the genre of horror fiction was not recognized as such, it is surprising that \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is cast in the form of a mystery novel. Stevenson invites his readers to try and get ahead of the story, to put the clues together and come to the conclusion. Today it is nearly impossible to pick up this story and not know the \\"secret,\\" but if you think back to the late 19th-century when this story was written you can get a sense for how Stevenson used the biases and limitations of his readers to his advantage in keeping them from what we might consider to be an obvious conclusion.<br /><br />More importantly, Stevenson is writing several decades before the writings of Sigmund Freud revolutionized the whole idea of human psychology. Yet we can certainly find evidence of the conscious and subconscious mind of which Freud would write. Stevenson reinforces this metaphor with the block of buildings that divides this particular part of London, with one side representing the civilized world of a respected physician and the other side the squalor of the world inhabited by an inhuman creature who gives in to his every earthly desire. The novella also speaks to the topic of evolution, with Hyde being described as \\"ape-like,\\" reinforcing the idea that our most human attributes remove us ever further from the category of mere animal.<br /><br />Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible. Not only because of its shorter length, but also because its evil is more realistic, even in terms of our imagination. We might be unable to reanimate the dead or to become the walking dead, but we can certainly relate to the idea of unleashing the beast buried with us. Even if we could not, we can recognize the \\"werewolf\\" in the real world in the form of serial killers who try to show a civilized face to us in public. This is not to say that the novella is simplistic, for Stevenson offers a sophisticated narrative. If this is one of those literary you have never read because you already know the story, then you should take out an evening to sit down and finally get around to reading it.<br /><br />This is the Enriched Classics edition of the novel, prepared by Barry V. Qualls, professor of English at Rutgers University, and Susan J. Wolfson, professor of English at Princeton University.  It includes an introduction that will provide readers with appropriate background information, a chronology of Stevenson's life and work, and a timeline that lays out the signficant events that constitute the historical context of hte novel.  There is also an outline of key themes and plot points, detailed explanatory notes (including Stevenson's own), and critical analysis that covers both contemporary and modern perspective on the novel.  For teachers there are discussion questions for classroom debate and a list of recommended books and films, plus period illustrations and photographs.

B00005JN5X|4.0|I loved the story but there was a lot of animal cruelty depicted in the film that was very hard to stomach. I didn't like how Peter Stormare's character changed to good. He makes a great bad guy and I guess it's just hard to see him otherwise. Matt Damon and Heath Ledger do great performances. I wish there had been more about the queen somehow. Over all it was very good, I don't reccomend it to small children. It can be hard to take.
B000059TFO|4.0|This movie makes some claim about being based on true events (the Goodman, Cheney and Schwerner murders of 1964) but essentially it's about racism, or more specifically the peculiar brand preached and practiced in the southern states at the time. Mississippi Burning succeeds not because it retells history or moralises, takes sides or casts judgments, but because its portrayal of this racism is deep and palpable. You can almost feel irrational hatred and bigotry glaring from the screen at times: the characters, while a little clich&eacute;d and mostly one-dimensional, are as you might expect them to have been.<br /><br />The stand-out performance comes from Hackman as Anderson, the former Mississippi sheriff turned FBI investigator: a character of much greater complexity than any other in the film, Anderson has to confront his own upbringing, deal with the determined but pig-headedly officious Ward (Dafoe) and resist his natural urges to throttle confessions out of the murderers. He alternates from frivolous jokester, taking the investigation only half-seriously, to passionate and determined lawman, to shuffling and bashful schoolboy when in the presence of Mrs. Pell. I've never seen Hackman put in a bad performance and he outshines everyone else in this movie.<br /><br />The film is nicely shot: the sets are prosaic, everyday types of places, the costumes are effective (FBI agents in stovepipe suits standout clumsily) and the screenplay is terrific, though lacking subtlety in places. If I had a criticism of Mississippi Burning it's that no black character is explored in much depth; the crusading is carried out by white northerners and the Negroes are just towed along behind the narrative, looking sad, oppressed and rather impotent. However that doesn't detract from the overall impact of what is a well-crafted piece of cinema.
B000001FS3|5.0|I've had this album in my collection for many years, but I only played it a couple of times. A friend who was over to work with me on a project put it on the CD changer, and I was bowled over.<br /><br />I probably should not waste too much space commenting on the first three songs, all huge hits, but they are so beautiful! Organ chords and bell-like guitar lead into a driving, hypnotic \\"Where the Streets Have No Name.\\" By a few seconds, this is the largest work on the album. U2 tips its hand, invoking the desert as the setting of a desire for meaning.<br /><br />In \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\\" a deeply moving song, the lead intones \\"I believe in Kingdom Come,\\" but even this is not enough to bring a purpose to life. Love is insufficient to realize this goal. The style is that of a rock anthem, with a serious tone.<br /><br />The more subdued \\"With or Without You,\\" is meaningful to me personally, and no doubt to many who have experienced the same paradox, the satisfaction and pain that love brings.<br /><br />\\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" is apocalyptic, an abrupt change of tone, hard rock, driving home a message that meaning is found through action against tyranny and militaristic, capitalistic American foreign policy.<br /><br />\\"Running to Stand Still\\" is a welcome respite, contemplative and melodic.<br /><br />\\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" is another gem on this consistently excellent album. The soaring vocal line rises to magnificent  desperation and hope, hanging on to love that slowly slips away.<br /><br />This is followed by the short and perfect \\"In God's Country.\\" This is the culminating point of the album, a quick and extremely high peak.<br /><br />A bluesy harmonica introduces the less challenging, and enjoyable \\"Trip Through Your Wires.\\"<br /><br />\\"One Tree Hill\\" is a less driving, quieter reprise of the mood set by the megahits at the outset of the album.<br /><br />\\"Exit\\" begins with gospel and very slowly builds into another driving lament.<br /><br />\\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" brings this endlessly creative and masterful collection of songs to a fitting end. In your face protest has never appealed to me, but art does, and the words accompanied by a march are easily interpreted, but satisfyingly indirect.<br /><br />I am reminded, in listening to this song, of the strong role that effective imagery plays in this album. So, buy it, and read the words as you listen. This is a deep album, about the challenges of life. Bono teaches us to have the courage to face the truth about the world in which we live.another driving lament. <br /> <br />\\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" brings this endlessly creative and masterful collection of songs to a fitting end.

B0007GAERG|5.0|This is for all the Haters of Mariah Carey.  You probably didn't even listen to this wonderful album and the people pretending to be Mariah Carey fans that's just sad.  Why don't you show some guts and admit your a hater too.<br /><br />The Emancipation of Mimi is 5 Stars in my eyes and should be to anybody else.  We Belong Together has been #1 for 13 weeks (going on 14 weeks) and Shake It Off is #4 and could be #1 soon.  An Album that has it's first 3 singles all make the top 20 on the Billboard is 5 stars in my book.  I like how the haters keep saying these are the only good songs on the album.  Before Shake It Off was shooting up the charts the haters were saying We Belong Together is the only good song on this album.  Then after Shake It Off came out it was those two songs are the only good songs on the album.  Pretty soon it'll be those 7 songs are the only good ones on the album.  I just trying to let the music fans who don't care what haters or Mariah Carey fan are doing.  All you care about is the music and just like I give Green Day's American Idiot the Thumbs Up I give this Album big Thumbs up!<br /><br />MUSIC LOVERS don't let haters keep you from hearing some of the best music of the year.  You know it's great don't let them talk you out of it!  There life less LOSERS!  Who have nothing better to do then to hate on one of the best Singers in the world!
B0006L16N8|4.0|Deciding between giving this closer to 4 or 5 was tricky, since I think this record surpasses the vast majority of those out there. <br /> <br />Recording is very good.  There's guitar crunch enough to appeal to those like like things edgier than more pop-rock, but they seemed to keep a limit on the heavier guitars probably so it would appeal to the softer rock crowd more. <br /> <br />Love the lyrics.  It starts off with a song I can identify with, because it speaks of being different. <br />the title reminds me of Ned's Atomic Dustbin's record \\"Are you normal?) <br />Square One, Fix You, Talk, Low, and Twisted Logic are probably my favs. <br />I also like speed of Sound, although this was certainly designed to be more radio-friendly. <br />I like the lyrics in Twisted Logic especially too, because I view them as a comment about much of the political scene (\\"We go backwards to go forwards in the end\\"). <br /> <br />In short, I would have given this a 5 is songs like Swallowed by the Sea and perthaps one or two others would have done a bit more or gone further (Coldplay can certainly do this). <br /> <br />At the same time, I realize they wanted to try to keep the appeal high to the softer-rock population. <br /> <br />Not a bad way to do things necessarily, since the more people you can spread your message to, the more who will at least hear it so they can decide to agree or disagree. <br /> <br />Am looking forward to seeing them in concert.  Radiohead and Spiritualized set a pretty high bar for me in the St. Louis-area, and let's see how this one goes.
B00005JNTX|5.0|The movie took place in Sin City, a city so corrupt and violent that a large section of the city was abandoned by the police  and was protected by scantily clad hookers. It was film noir at its finest. The movie consisted of several loosely connected vignettes. The heros were the following: an old, tough, but straight cop; an extremely ugly and extremely tough ex-con, with his own moral code; and a murderer on the lam, he had plastic surgery, but his sense of public duty led him into trouble. The villians were extremely evil and powerful, but there was a cosmic justice in this world, and the bad guys got a type of justice. The movie was extremely violent, but its surreal nature and its graphic novel type character buffered the viewer.     The movie was a unique and fun experience.
B000002WPI|5.0|Look, I'm not going to give you a history lesson because I could care less about that type of nonesense. Let me just tell you how it is. <br />\\"Enter the Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers\\" is one of the most interesting, strong debut records of the last, oh, twenty years or so. In any genre of music. The production, done by the greatly unappreciated R/Z/A, is dirty, dark, moody, creative and beautifully lo-fi. It sounds like RZA recorded the tracks then put a mic up to his record player and used that as the main take. The production on this record probably terrifies every other producer in music to this day: it's impossible to duplicate. <br />MC wise, at this point, the Wu were pretty untoppable. Everyone is at the top of their game, and none have them ever sounded better. The late, great Ol' Dirty Bastard is one of a kind, a walking punchline who appears to have absolutly no shame(listen to the cat sing). Method Man turns every line into a hook(take a listen to \\"Method Man\\"). Raekwon the Chef and Ghostface Killer spin tales of life on the streets, but never does it sound like trite, typical fare. It's always delivered with humor and insight rare in records of this ilk(for more stuff like this take a listen to their team up on Raekwon's classic debut \\"Only Built for Cuban Linx\\"). GZA is one of the most literate, intellegent rappers in the business and deserves to be in the same league as Q-Tip. Only Inspectah Deck and Masta Killa fail to leave much of a lasting impression. <br />Look, \\"36 Chambers\\" should not have to live in genre limitations. It's as hip-hop as it gets, but it's also as raw and energetic as any rock record that came out in the ninties, and as dense as layered as any jazz I've ever heard. This is a great record. <br />Just one question: who wants to play torture?

B00006AG5N|5.0|Do you really need another review of this CD?  Probably not, so I'll try to keep it brief.  Obviously, the idea here was to make a CD with Elvis' #1 hits, in the vein of the smash hit Beatles CD with the same concept.  Well, why not?  If it worked for the Beatles, it should work for Elvis, too.  And it did, with the CD being a worldwide smash hit.  But a little known fact is, they kind of fudged things in order to get \\"Burning Love\\" included.  See, the generally accepted \\"official\\" record charts are New Musical Express in the UK and Billboard in the US.  \\"Burning Love\\" reached #7 on the New Musical Express chart and it reached #2 on the Billboard chart. But \\"Burning Love\\" absolutely is THE classic Elvis song of the '70s, so I can forgive them for \\"cheating\\" a little in order to include it.  If you only buy one Elvis CD, it will probably be this one.  If you buy every Elvis CD, you are as crazy as I am.
B000002N2P|5.0|Although it took me a few listens to appreciate the greatness of Insomniac, I now would consider the album to be very skillfully structured and likely Green Day's best punk rock CD. Right from the top there is an admirable melodic factor with the upbeat song \\"Armatage Shanks\\", and later on there are such gems as \\"Brain Stew\\" and \\"Bab's Uvula Who\\". \\"Brain Stew\\", one of the few successful hits on this album, features a chromatically descending chord progression similar to the one on the later song \\"Hitchin' A Ride\\" as well as peculiar lyrics and the occasional all-out instrumental jam. \\"Bab's Uvula Who\\", although not a hit track, is one of my favorite Green Day songs. This piece has energetic guitar patterns, very catchy lyrics, and a fitting brevity. Unfortunately, the mild simplicity of many other tracks on Insomniac cause them not to be quite as stunning as the typical Green Day song. \\"Walking Contradiction\\" also seems to indicate the first sign of repetition in Green Day's history, bearing many similarities to the early song \\"16\\" from the album 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. Overall, however, Insomniac is very likeable for its addicting punk rock sound and (as usual) the appeal of the lyrics and rhythms. I would recommend this album greatly, especially to fans of the band who do not yet own it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I didn't know what to think of the remake. But above all I totally love the music! And the storyline is wonderful! Gerard Butler had a hard role to fill as the Phantom, I think he is pretty young for the character, but all in all he does what he can. Some was a little violence, but you had the idea of that with the play version anyway. I think it brings chills to anyone watching it, and in my opinion is still a great film.. but others expected Michael Crawford in the role he created.. and yes he still could have done it.  He has the most beautiful and expressive hands and his voice brings you to your knees. Still, I expect the viewers might want a  younger cast though... the film is considered a triangle gothic love story and does bring alot of tears to one's eyes.
B000001GBJ|4.0|I'm not typically a fan of new age style music, and I have to admit that I received this CD by mistake from a music club.  I was too lazy to return it; so I just stuck it in my CD collection expecting to never listen to it.  Eventually, it went into my CD player, and I was surprised by its beauty.  The group consists of composer and pianist Rolf Lovland and Irish violinist Fionnuala Sherry.  As a newbie to this genre, I'm not sure what I would compare their sound to - perhaps a bit of Enya mixed with light piano jazz and a touch of Clannad.  It reminds me vaguely of the music from \\"Titanic,\\" although somewhat gentler.  Their songs incorporate a number of instruments, generally supporting the piano and violin.  Some songs include lovely vocals by the Irish National Chamber Choir.  Secret Garden definitely have an Irish sound, but not overwhelmingly so.  Obviously, I stumbled on this CD by accident, but it's been a nice addition to my collection.  I think that this CD would appeal to many people who like contemporary classical music - highly recommended.

Baaaad!!!!!<br /><br />Gee! This film sucked!!!
B0007GAEW6|3.0|A large injury to my rating for this album was the towering length of many of the tracks, which seem like they would have been a lot better off if cut down a bit. I have much difficulty in being patient with lengthy songs, and with multiple 13 minute songs on this album I was often forced to fake a grin and at least attempt to hold fast through every second. Aside from this, however, The Mars Volta use a variety of neat sound effects, show off some nifty singing, and can play the electric guitar like mad! I never thought I would like a tune in a foreign language, but I guess I was mistaken since I ended up adoring the track \\"Facilis Descenus Averni\\", despite its being one of those 13'ers. This track has a hugely enjoyable bass effect, an eerie percussion beginning, wild electric guitar playing, a calm alternate section with piano and eerie vocals, and a whole lot of noise. Other musical styles venture through electronic voices, tracks with squawking birds as an intro, and a couple soft songs. I wouldn't quite recommend this album, but there a number of commendable tracks. <br />I recommend: <br />Sarcophagi <br />Umbilical Syllables <br />Facilis Descenus Averni <br />Track 5 <br />The Widow <br />L'Via L'Viaquez <br />

B000AARKOO|1.0|Unfairly judged at the box office?  Frankly, I think critics were right on target.  Unlike his other movies, Ridley Scott's story telling on this one fell flat.  Action and cinematography were on par as usual.  However, I just could not find a compelling reason for the crusaders in this film.  It seemed all the activities and scenes were built up just so Orlando Bloom could have his big save-the-day moment on screen.    It was just a little too convenient that a blacksmith, who had just lost his wife and daughter, would suddenly have a noble Lord and crusader show up at his doorstep claiming to be his father asking him to join the crusades. Why does the nobleman show up now of all times after never seeing his son for several years? The plot seemed too easily set up.    Bloom very quickly becomes disillusioned by the real intentions of the crusaders, but he seems to let it go as if unphased by it all.  He's just hanging around Jerusalem, building up his farm until it is time for him to make a difference.    So what is the movie supposed to be about?  Is is about a man who had lost all hope and manages to find himself by embarking on a spiritual mission? Is it about Muslims and Christians being able to live in peace after all?  The themes switch back and forth.  Is there supposed to be a theme?      Sorry Ridley and Orlando, stick to what you know.
078322687X|5.0|In the mid 1980s, a group of young actors and actresses called \\"The Brat Pack\\" would emerge.    Different members of this group would appear in films together.   These roles would range from high school teenagers to young adults.    At the same time, a young writer, producer, and director named John Hughes was beginning to make a name for himself with such movies as \\"Mr. Mom\\", \\"Vacation\\", \\"European Vacation\\", and \\"Weird Science\\".   The combination of John Hughes and The Brat Pack would come together for the 1985 movie \\"The Breakfast Club\\".    What would be an inexpensive movie would not only become a surprise hit, but one that would stand the test of time for two decades.    The reason for this movie standing the test of time is that it is a movie that both teenagers and adults who were once teenagers could relate to. <br /> <br />The plot of this movie is very simple.   The story of this film takes place over an 8 hour period on March 24, 1984 at the fictional Shermer High School in the fictional Chicago suburb of Shermer Illinois.  If you have followed John Hughes' films, you will know that Shermer Illinois has been used in several of his movies (examples include \\"Weird Science\\", \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\", and \\"Sixteen Candles\\").   It is on that date that 5 High School students, each from different backgrounds come together for a detention session.    When the detention session starts; Richard Vernon (played by Paul Gleason) the teacher in charge tells the 5 students to write a 1000 word essay explaining \\"who they think they are\\".    As the detention session begins, the students are quiet, but then the obvious frictions that come from the different backgrounds of each of the students soon will surface.  However it is from those frictions that each of the students will soon get to know each other, and some bonding begins to surface.   The students will soon realize they have similar problems when it comes to peer pressure and home life. <br /> <br />It is the fivemembers that come from the Brat Pack that give the film its charm:   Emilio Estevez as Andrew, the high school jock;  Anthony Michael Hall as Brian,  the brainy nerd;  Molly Ringwald as Claire the preppy 'princess';  Ally Sheedy as Allison, the psycho \\"basket case\\"; and Judd Nelson as John Bender, as the troublemaker.    In particular it is Judd Nelson's performance as Bender that really stands out.   Perhaps because \\"The Breakfast Club\\" was both a John Hughes and Brat Pack movie is why this performance was overlooked.   Nelson's performance was outstanding and probably even warranted some Oscar consideration.   Looking back at the film some 20 years later, you really see what a great performance it is.   Bender also provides some of the film's lighter moments - in particular when he squares off with Vernon.   However it is also Bender that really breaks the ice in the film.   It is actually a result of Bender's sarcasm that the dialogue begins between the five students.    At first, the other four do not like Bender (and vice versa), but as the bonding begins in the film, it is interesting to see how Bender will take the blame for some mischief by the group - as well as the group covering for Bender's antics. <br /> <br />There are other outstanding performances in this movie as well.  Molly Ringwald is very believable in her role as the preppy as is Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd.   Next to Nelson's performance, it is probably Ally Sheedy's role as Allison the \\"basket case\\" that stands out.    Allison is a strange character - one who is very quiet at the beginning.  Therefore the character of Allison is going to have to rely more on physical motion.   Sheedy pulls this off brilliantly.     Estevez also does a good job playing the jock - the scene that he explains why he is in detention is outstanding. <br /> <br />While this film does a great job at a character study among the five students, this film does a character study from the adult perspective - namely around the character of Richard Vernon.   This comes in a scene with Carl the Janitor.  We get some insight into why Vernon got into teaching, and how things didn't go the way they expected.   While Carl might only be a janitor, he provides Vernon with a lot of insight into himself. <br /> <br />One thing that John Hughes does very well is integrate music into the movie.   While the music takes a secondary role to the story, the music is used at the right time with the right scene.   Keith Forsey, a producer who works with Billy Idol was in charge of the music with this song.   \\"The Breakfast Club\\" would feature the monster-hit by Simple Minds called \\"Don't You (Forget About Me\\") (This song would launch Simple Minds' career in the United States).   The instrumentation of this song is simply brilliant.   Listen to how the drum beats and keyboards play perfectly in the movie.   Another great song that didn't get nearly as much attention was Karla DeVito's \\"We Are Not Alone\\".   This song is used during a \\"rebellious\\" scene in the movie - and it fits perfect. <br /> <br />One scene that happens toward the end of the movie is when Hall's character of Brian asks the question \\"Will we all be friends when we go to school on Monday?\\"   This scene is crafted so well by Hughes - and it's a scene that any teenager or former teenager has been exposed to.   In a way, that scene is almost a symbol of the entire movie.    <br /> <br />Overall, this is a movie that I find myself watching over and over.   Each successive time I watch it, I find something new.   In a way, I would have loved to have seen an official sequel to see what happens when they all get back to school.     This is a movie I highly recommend. <br />
B000000993|4.0|This review is from someone who only has 1 Tool cd, so if you're a huge fan, you may want to look at another review for deeper insight. I was in college when this cd came out, and 2 songs that still play great today are \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex\\". These 2 songs made the purchase worth the money for me, while the rest of the cd is ok. If you buy the cd, make sure you play Prison Sex really really loud!
B00079018K|5.0|What a superb debut album! Although this C.D. has limitations concerning copying it onto the computer and such (how sinister, the band's hardly well known anyway and they felt like limiting those who were interested), the songs themselves can hardly be critiqued. Nearly all the melodies are very complex and unique, some tracks having powerful bass effects, some having trumpets, and some having electronic noises added in. Kasabian has a very original sound, sometimes combining rap, rock, and techno components together to form an extremely interesting result (for example, Processed Beats). The hit \\"Club Foot\\" off this album is also a very detailed and admirable track, which features a low-toned bass effect in the background, eerie lyrics, and plenty of electronic sounds. Each song has little or nothing in common with the others, which exposes the listener to a wide variety of Kasabian's musical talents. Thank goodness I decided to take a gamble on this album and buy it without hearing any of the tracks, for it's wondrous! I would highly recommend this album, for it is filled with a unique rock style that begs to be heard. <br />I recommend: <br />Club Foot <br />Processed Beats <br />Reason Is Treason <br />I.D. <br />Orange <br />L.S.F. <br />Test Transmission <br />Butcher Blues <br />Pinch Roller <br />Cutt Off <br />Running Battle <br />Ovary Stripe <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed the initial run of the series when Fox ran it in 2002; however after the SciFi channel ran a couple episodes before their Friday night line up, my interest was piqued. When I got the dvds my plan was to watch a couple episodes a day for a week, but I simply couldn't turn the thing off. Finished the set in a day and a half. The character dynamics are wonderfully refreshing, and the dialog is witty. After getting over the no aliens and scifi-western genre mix, I've determined this is one of the best written and acted TV series that I've seen in a very long time. I truly wish there were more than 14 episodes, but at least I'll get Serenity :-)
B000002BFZ|5.0|if any band from the 90's proves that grunge or alternative rock in general wasn't just a flash in the pan, fad, or minor rock movement, it is pearl jam. pearl jam started as a smart, emotional update to classic rock, then with vs and vitalogy showed some wierd sides-some funk, some punk, some stuff that was just plain wierd. but with no code, pearl jam went from being a great alternative rock band with a little expiramentation to a alternative rock STAPLE. <br /> <br />no code goes far out-then comes back without a hitch. nearly every song on here is wonderful in its own way-sometimes is a slow-burning ballad, a wierd yet perfectly suitable way to start the album, then hail hail rocks hard ala vs' go and animal, then who you are and in my tree are wierd rockers with good hooks (however i think in my tree is one of PJ's greatest songs ever). smile follows in a neil young-type slow bluesy hook-rocker, and it leads up to off he goes- a 6  minute long acoustic song that is nearly the highlight of the disc. habit is punky and hard with a great spoken word sentence in a break- 'this being said as a child of the 90s'-red mosquito is like a better smile with some acoustic work, lukin is a short punk firestorm-then comes the 2 that make the disc-present tense, a song that sounds like release's little brother and has an INCREDIBLE 3rd minute-and mankind, with stone singing, has teh best hook on the album and trounces any alternative on mtv today in catchiness. i'm open is a poetical rant, and around the bend is a neil-young ballad-though i believe with a bit of length, it would be better. <br /> <br />every pearl jam fan needs to own this peice of mature art- its another PJ album that shows that alternative has the guns to not only go up against the classic rock monarchy-but that alternative rock has the collective strength to make the classics OBSOLETE.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This flick, made by some 20 somethings, is a work of genius that will definitely stand the test of time.  I've seen the movie 2 or three times, but wanted to buy a copy not only to watch again, but to get the commentaries on the disc.  The commentaries turned out to be less than thrilling, but interesting. You get info on how the animation was done, and the fact there were several animators, which I did not previously know. Some of the philosophical discourses in the flick are bs, but overall this is an inspired treatment of lucid dreaming, and a pleasure to watch.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|After re-releasing two-disc special editions of The Shawshank Redemption, Goodfellas, Heat and Bullitt (to name a few), they are finally giving the Batman movies the treatment they deserve (well, at least the first three). <br /> <br />Each of the four movies are two-discs so this entire set has 8-discs total. Each movie has a commentary track with the respective director which includes Joel Schumacher, who despite directing one of the worst films of all-time, will hopefully make admends to the Bat-fans out there by explaining why he made Batman & Robin the way it was. <br /> <br />Glad to see WB finally making up for their releases of the pieces of crap, (more often) barebones releases of yesteryear.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day has been accused of selling out their entire music career. First for signing to a major label, and most recently for the unforgivable crime of growing up, becoming more political, and writing powerful songs. Yeah, I think it sounds stupid, too. <br /> <br />I personally am not a Bush-supporter myself, but even if I was, I don't think it would change my opinion. These guys have a great way of mixing in politics with music. They don't care if you agree or not, they just want to get what they think across. They are not the greatest musicians in the world, and they know this, so they never go too far. They always make the best out of their skills. <br /> <br />\\"American Idiot\\" - To be honest, it's not really anything that Green Day hasn't done before. You can hear shades of \\"Welcome to Paradise\\" and \\"Nice Guys Finish Last\\" all throughout. But that doesn't stop it from being quite an infectious song. And I must add that the lyrics are very brilliant. <br /> <br />\\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" - This is the song that really opens your eyes. You've heard \\"American Idiot\\" a billion and one times on the radio, so you start to expect something similar following. You couldn't be more wrong. This 9 minute (dare I say) epic blends many different styles. Straight-forward rock 'n' roll, heartfelt (but not corny) ballads, and, of course, classic punk can be heard in this one song alone. It's quite an excellent beginning to the story of Jesus of Suburbia/St. Jimmy, but other reviewers have gone through that enough, so I'll try not too. <br /> <br />\\"Holiday\\" - The most politically charged song on the album is also one of the best. Billie Joe rips through the lyrics unforgivingly, and the band has never sounded better. And you gotta love the \\"representative from California\\" verse. <br /> <br />\\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" - Yes, I've heard it just as much as the next guy. Yes, the radio stations need to stop playing it so much. But just because it is overplayed does not mean it isn'ta great song. From the opening guitar to the very end, it is incredibly powerful. <br /> <br />\\"Are We the Waiting\\" - An excellent anthem that has a very catchy chorus. This plays a very important part in the story as well. <br /> <br />\\"St. Jimmy\\" - The first real punk track on this album. Billie Joe, Mike, and Tre play the crap out of their instruments as BJ does some of the fastest singing to date on a Green Day album. Even when the tempo slightly slows down near the middle, it's still a great song to mosh to. Not that I encourage moshing or anything. *rolls eyes* <br /> <br />\\"Give Me Novocaine\\" - My second favorite song on the album. The vocals are really nice and the style is really laid-back. Even the slightly heavier chorus is still pretty laid-back. Once again, Billie Joe has written some genius lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"She's A Rebel\\" - Another great fast punk song. Not much more to say than that. <br /> <br />\\"Extraordinary Girl\\" - It probably shouldn't, but it's hard not to compare to \\"She's A Rebel.\\" And when you do that, it's not as good. But it's still a pretty good song that is worth a listen. <br /> <br />\\"Letterbomb\\" - Another one of the weaker tracks on the album, but it is still not bad and it plays a very important part in the story. <br /> <br />\\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" - My absolute favorite song on the album. And no, it's not just because it's been getting a lot of airplay and it's not just because of the popular music video. From day one, this has been my favorite song. The instruments are simple, but brilliant at the same time. Billie Joe has never sounded better. He sounds even better than he did in \\"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).\\" The lyrics are amazing and heartfelt, and I think it's status as the new single is well-deserving. <br /> <br />\\"Homecoming\\" - With the evergrowing popularity of \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" this song is coming to be known as \\"the other 9-minute song.\\" However, I find that unfair. This song is just as good as \\"Jesus of Suburbia.\\" It's just more experimental, that's all. It may have something to do with the fact that Mike and Tre each have a song on it. There are excellent blends of acoustic guitar, saxophones, keyboards, echoes, and other sounds. The last part, \\"We're Coming Home Again,\\" is very catchy and would be a suitable ending for the disc. <br /> <br />\\"Whatsername\\" - I always feel a little weird when this song comes on. The last part of \\"Homecoming\\" feels like it's the perfect end to the album. Then to have this drumbeat come in is rather odd. However, after a minute, everything sinks in, and this develops into an excellent song that is also a very worthy ending. <br /> <br />Say what you want about them selling out; Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tre Cool have come a long way. From playing underground punk clubs to huge stadiums, they have matured not only personally but musically. \\"American Idiot\\" is, in my opinion, their greatest effort yet, with catchy, meaningful songs, and the occasional good message here and there. It may be hard to top this one.
0451169514|1.0|This book is my mark of shame.  I am a voracious reader and have plowed through many, many books that were dull and dreary just to finish reading them.<br /><br />\\"It\\" remains the only book I have ever started to read that I have not been able to force myself to finish reading, no matter how many times I try.  Dreadful and boring, hopelessly long winded and riddled with pointless asides.  I find it hard to believe that the same man who wrote \\"The Stand\\" could  bring himself to foist this morass of mindlessness on his readers.<br /><br />\\"It\\" isn't all bad; it's a sure cure for insommnia.
B000002AZ8|1.0|Let me start off by saying I'm not here to bash this album.  I am a fan of Ten and Verses, but this was one change from this band I didn't care for.   <br /> <br />To me their quality of music dropped pretty bad when they made this album.  The high points to me were Nothing Man and Better Man.  Corduroy had a moment but over all this album was more lyrically driven(which there is nothing wrong with because music is nothing more than expressing one's opinion).  The quality of the music is way too simple coming off their last two albums. <br /> <br />This is obviously an opinion from a fan who preferes the old Pearl Jam.  Having said this, my opinion is that if you're a Pearl Jam fan period or a fan of their recent works, this would be the album to get because this is where the big change began.  If you are a fan of the old, this album may not be for you.
B0002Y4T92|3.0|I was expecting a more inspired compilation. Some of the playing was very good, as to be expected; however, I watched the entire dvd in one setting feeling more numb than enthused. I went back to watch it again a few more times just to see if it was just me, but after several more attempts nothing. This dvd is a  snoozefest. You can say that you enjoyed this player and that one, but beyond the well crafted musicianship, I found no entertainment value whatsoever.
B00030590I|5.0|This is a fantastic martial arts film.  The cosutmes and characters in this film are amazing.  The story line is captivating and worthy of watching over and over.
0763621803|5.0|My son loves Charlie and Lola, and so do I!  This is a book I don't mind reading again and again.  The characters are lovable, the writing is clever, and the illustrations are so creative!  Lola is a picky eater, but Charlie uses his imagination and her's to convince Lola to eat all of the foods she refuses to eat.  Whether you are a picky eater or not, this is a great investment!
B00005U2JL|5.0|Being a fan of MM not just for the music but their takes on religion, politics and \\"rules\\" this dvd is a sweet glimpse into their (or his) world. The 30 min, Death Parade feature was excellent and for me the highlight as you can watch it over and over again. This dvd is really explicit and uncensored but that's the beauty of MM and it works nicely. While the live performances are indeed kewl, it will never replace the feeling of hearing the actual songs the first few times. If you are a MM fan, this is a must-buy. I'm so tired of people writing nonsense about this band and its leader, and they should look closer and see that they are the problem, in fact they should buy it and see the mind behind one of the biggest music icons of all time. In conclusion, screw the teenyboppers and their heehee ways, buy the dvd and bask in knowing you are part of something much more. MM forever!
B0002IQNAG|5.0|The ultimate version of the ultimate zombie film. This is the DVD to own, three different cuts of the film and a disc full of extras, it is DOTD paradise. For anyone not familiar with the film, perhaps you should buy a cheaper version, but for fans this box set is definately worth the cash. This is truly a treasure for the die hards of this movie, if you love DAWN OF THE DEAD, you will not be disappointed in the ultimate edition.
0446677450|4.0|I liked it very much.  <br />I just signed up so I can write a review. <br />I think this book is trying to tell you how you can change your mind abou money, not necessary give you all details. If you want to learn about money and start to build your financial wealth, you must read this book!
B00003CX97|5.0|David Lean's movie \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" based on Pierre Boulle's novel is one of the most unusual movies about war. It depicts the lives of Colonel Nicholson, Colonel Saito and Commander Shears. The movie is outstanding in its acting, screenplay, direction and music. It shows a battle of wills between Alec Guinness (Nicholson) and Sessue Hayakawa (Saito). Saito insists that officers must perform manual labor which is resisted by Nicholson while building the bridge. The screenplay was written by Carl Foreman, several of his successes including High Noon, but he was never rewarded for this movie though it has outstanding dialogs due to people suspecting that he was a communist. His treatment was not very good and was given an award after he died in 1984.  <br /> <br />William Holden (Shears) escapes and is asked to go back to destroy the bridge. In the meantime, Nicholson is released and starts helping Saito build the bridge. Finally, Nicholson agrees, not so much to cooperate with his captor as to provide a morale-boosting project for the military engineers under his command. The colonel will prove that, by building a better bridge than Saito's men could build, the British soldier is a superior being even when under the thumb of the enemy. As the bridge goes up, Nicholson becomes obsessed with completing it to perfection, eventually losing sight of the fact that it will benefit the Japanese. He does not realize that what he is doing is helping the enemy. Upon his return, Shears realizes that Nicholson's mania to complete his project has driven him mad. Filmed in Ceylon, Bridge on the River Kwai was completed in about 18 months and won 7 academy awards including best picture, best director, best actor and best screenplay. Alec Guiness justifiably got the best actor award, does a memorable-indeed, a classic-job in making the ramrod British colonel a profoundly ambiguous type. With a rigid, serene disposition, he displays the courage and tenacity of a lion, as well as the denseness and pomposity of a dangerously stupid, inbred snob. He shows, beneath the surface of a hero, the aspects of an inhuman fool. He gives one of the most devastating portraits of a militarist that we have ever seen.  <br /> <br />The screenplay award went to Pierre Boulle who did not know a word of English. Some of the best dialogs of the movie are: <br />Shears, \\"I can think of calling Saito several things, but reasonable.\\" <br /> <br />Shears: \\"You mean you are going to follow the law, regardless of the consequences\\" <br />Nicholson: \\"Without law there is no civilization\\" <br />Shears: \\"But here there is no civilization.\\" <br />Nicholson:\\" Then we have a chance to introduce it. I suggest that we drop the talk about escape.\\" <br /> <br />Later when one person talks about escape and says that Nicholson only suggested that they do not escape,  <br />Shears: \\"Listen kiddo, when your Colonel suggests something, it is a command.\\" <br /> <br />Shears hates the foolish courage of the colonel and says, \\"This is the kind of courage that will get us all killed.\\" The movie shows the difference between practical against foolhardiness. Though made in 1957, it has not aged and can be watched now. The new edition has a beautiful transfer. In general, the movie is a welcome change to movies like Braveheart which have little thinking and too much gore. Please note that this movie is based on a novel and is fictional, it is not based on any historical event (and does not claim it). David Lean won two awards for direction, both of them were outstanding movies, this is one of them. It is worth collecting.
1401300901|5.0|I finished reading this book about a week ago (while on vacation which is something I never do) and still I find myself thinking about it. I was simply shocked to read that this talented author was only 21 when she sat down and wrote this book. I was truly taken aback that she could write with such first hand knowledge of such a difficult time. It  made me just want to read anything she will ever write. This story will stir every emotion you can think of, I actually laughed one moment and cried the next. Being such an avid reader I can honestly say that Cecelia Ahern, is one of the best authors in today's' market. If you haven't read this it is a must.
B000084T18|1.0|I am having a hard time understanding rap. There are so many musicians out there that are infinitely better. Especially jazz musicians who spend their life becoming amazing at an instrument and most of the time make very little money at it. I am sure that there are some \\"true\\" rap musicians out there, but I have not heard or seen a single one. If you want to hear true musicians listen to people like Chick Corea, Al Di Meola, Joe Satriani, Steve Kimock, Charlie Hunter, Will Bernardo, John McLaughlin, Wynton Marsalis etc... These guys are actual musicians. They understand music, they know how to create true masterpieces. This 50 Cent and almost all of the rap, R&B, hip-hop seen is destroying true, worthy music. Don't feed this beast that lacks any musical abilities. If I could give it a lower score I would, and yes, I have heard this CD.
078322608X|4.0|It helps to know a little going into this movie because the opening doesn't explain enough to hold you. But be patient. The information overload is softened by arresting visuals and soon enough the situation is clear: a man from the future (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time twice for a sample of the virus that has killed everyone in the present except those living underground. A psychiatrist (Madeline Stowe) who thinks he's crazy in 1990 comes to believe him in 1996, but both are too late to thwart the plague and he is killed by the secret service.     That seems to be the story. This is science fiction, so coherence isn't needed. It's also a Terry Gilliam film, so imagination is. \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" has enough invention, flashy acting (Brad Pitt got an Oscar nod) and surface glitter to sustain three movies. Too much of a good thing? Maybe, except that Gilliam here controls his material, not always the case with this director (see his 2005 Grimm brothers fiasco.) He plays his actors to their strengths (Christopher Plummer is Pitt's scientist father) and his camera stays with them, exploring each scene, not missing a trick.    Nor will the attentive viewer. Gilliam's production and lighting designs boggle the mind. An airport sequence with a small boy and strange adults is edited into the movie piecemeal, mystifying as it unfolds but paying off at the end, with its stunning final revelation. By that time, all the unexplained detail and storytelling (expanded from a short French film) may start to make sense. It is difficult to sit through the credits without admiring Gilliam's skill at keeping you guessing for as long as he has.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|With all the lousy movies floating around lately, it was nice to see one that I actually enjoyed.  Samuel L. Jackson did a great job as usual.  The rest of the cast was very good too.  With all the good reviews on Amazon for this movie, I thought it might be good, and it is.
6304806434|4.0|I love this movie and, really, it isn't like I'm any kind of Nicolas Cage fan. I'm not. I am, however, a major fan of Steve Buscemi and John Cusack. They're what takes this film from mediocre to very entertaining, together with the rest of a really fine cast. Gotta admit though, I did snicker when asked what is wrong with serial murderer Garland Greene, Cage replies straightfaced, \\"My guess is, a lot\\".  Garland is played by one of my all-time favorite actors, Steve Buscemi. John Malkovich does one his finest gigs as master criminal \\"Cyrus the Virus\\", just \\"flowing\\" through all his scenes like the professional and good actor that he is. \\"Johnny 23\\" is wonderfully played by character actor Daniel Trejo. Ving Rhames is not the greatest actor in the world but he is a likable cuss, even as bad guy/bouncer \\"Diamond Dog\\". This would have been enough but then they throw in agent \\"Vince Larkin\\" (John Cusack, who is in the classic GROSS POINT BLANKE -- and he's great there, too.)<br /><br />Personnaly, I generally skip the first few minutes of the movie. Poe (Cage) screwing up and getting thrown in jail. Yawn. Tender scenes with the wife. Another yawn. Let's get to the good stuff. That would be Cyrus' plan to take over the airplane and escape, along with an infamous drug dealer from whom he stands to make a lot of money. It's well done, the characters are interesting, and Buscemi alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />This one is a keeper so go ahead and buy the thing.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think of the film as it opened upon a very non-traditional set; chalked in houses, very \\"play-like\\" indeed.  But the sparseness of the set adds to the raw quality of the work as a whole, and complements the simplicity of the meaning surrounding the movie.  While there may be a multiplicity in the interpretation of the work, the many different standpoints all stem from one, very darkly demonstrated, conviction that the writer/director has. <br /> <br />I will admit, I was disturbed and uncomfortable at times.  Some scenes were not pleasant to watch, not \\"entertaining\\" in the traditional sense, but nonetheless important in a holistic understanding of the movie. <br /> <br />Grace's transformation is almost unbearble.  You want to scream at her to not be so complacent, to break her chains, to unsilence whatever goodness she believes she can uphold and enshrine among the evil seeds of the town.  In a way, the ending is very satisfying to the viewer, that justice is finally served.  And in this confession of vindication, I perhaps fulfill the message of the film.  The idea that the director embodies in the carefully scripted dialouge and inconsistencies.  I enjoy the violence, the pain...in the end, am I not, as Grace becomes, merely another human being who cannot overcome that.   <br /> <br />It is that human-ness; that inescapable and satiated dark side that the film displays with honesty and preciseness.  There's an elm street in every town, a deceitful little boy, a passive agressive mother, primitive men with primitive needs.  Whether we admit it or not, whether we see it to begin with, it is there and we are part of it.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|You've heard of 7th Heaven as a wholesome family drama. You've heard of One Tree Hill as a slightly angst teenage drama. You've heard of The O.C. as a primetime Soap Opera. And then you've vaguely heard of \\"Everwood\\" which has been compared to 7th Heaven, Dawson's Creek and Gilmore Girls. Although Gilmore Girls is arguably the best dramedy on television, Everwood is a brilliant Drama with a wonderful set of characters and stories.  <br /> <br />The first season starts off with the death of Julia Brown, a surgeon's wife and mother of two. The renowned New York surgeon, Dr. Andy Brown (played marvelously by Treat Williams), who has spent most of his life working and neglecting his family, is devastated by his wife's death. He then decides to move his children, 15-year-old Ephram Brown (Gregory Smith) and 9-year-old Delia Brown (Vivien Cardone) from their beloved New York home to the small and quaint town of Everwood, Colorado. Although Ephram, in his teen-angst, is furious at his father for moving them, the viewer can't imagine how someone could hate a town so serene, yet majestic. With its breathtaking hills and wonderful landscape, you'd wonder why anyone wouldn't want to live there. But the Browns are city people, especially vaguely geeky and introvert Ephram who finds it especially hard to adjust when he meets Amy who dazzles him at first sight, and then finds out she has a boyfriend, Colin, who's in a coma. <br /> <br />I wouldn't go so far as to call it a \\"family drama\\", though. The season centers on the Browns' the adjustment to Everwood and Colin's slow recovery. Furthermore, subjects such as abortion and homosexuality are presented in unexpected and somewhat controversial ways. Those subjects continue more abundantly during the second season which is also worth getting on DVD if or when it comes out (release date has not yet been set). <br /> <br />What makes Everwood different from 7th Heaven, The O.C., Dawson's Creek, One Tree Hill and all the other dramason TV is (first of all) the writing on the show. The stories are unpredictable without being confusing or too far-fetched. It is smart, dramatic and still maintains light-hearted and witty moments to make you laugh and smile. The dialogue is believable without being dull and simple. It's original and realistic and delivered wonderfully by all of its actors (that's right, all of them) which brings me to the second reason Everwood is so great: the acting. It's a shame nothing about Everwood has attracted the Emmy voters, but as critics agree, Everwood features Treat Williams, Gregory Smith, Emily Van Camp and Tom Amandes just to name a few who play their roles perfectly. You can easily get attached to the characters and feel what they feel just like on television shows like Gilmore Girls, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and even Sex and the City. I should also mention what few reviewers do when reviewing a TV show: Everwood is visually extremely pleasant. It is filmed in Utah and parts of Canada, so the landscape is beautiful but the sets are also good eye candy for the show and set the tone of certain scenes almost magically. <br /> <br />Although Everwood doesn't get a particularly large number of viewers each week, it is a true masterpiece. It isn't written like a guilty pleasure; it doesn't feel like a guilty pleasure and definitely is not a guilty pleasure. It's been a long time since television has aired a pure drama as good as Everwood. It's not like most TV shows, it's better. <br />
B000002B7U|5.0|THis Album is by far one of my all time favorites. It Blows \\"Bark at the Moon\\" away. Bark/Sin, were the 2 albums that feature unbeleivable axe-man Jake E. Lee. \\"Ultimate Sin\\" totally rocks. Its got fast guitar playing, and really awsome drumming. The album starts w/ the title track \\"Ultimate Sin.\\" Tne opening sounds like guns firing on an enemy as represented by the drums, then Jake fires in w/ a full on guitar assault. [sweet solo here too] \\"Secret Looser,\\" another one of my favorites on this album. Totally cpatures the essence of the 80s. There's is also the other video from this album \\"Lightning Strikes,\\" this song shows how Jake can really shred on the guitar. \\"Shot In the Dark,\\" damn good closing song. [this was the biggest hit off this album] The other stuff is good too, but those are the high points on the album. It's a shame that on the album \\"Essential Ozzy,\\" that nothing came off this album! This album is one of his best, also this is one that's tough to find in stores. I don't know why, but I guess that's up to Ozzy. In All I think that this album is one of his best! Don't waste time with Bark, if you can find this one get it! Every guitarist in Ozzy's band had their landmark album. Randy had \\"Tribute,\\" Zakk had \\"No Rest for the Wicked,\\" and Jake had \\"Ultimate Sin!\\" This album is worth every penny!!!
B0000542D2|4.0|I always thought Apple were slow to update the Beatles classics (we are still waiting for the remastered CDs!), so when i heard about this new DVD i rushed out and bought it. <br />The film is as good as it ever was, of course, but i have to admit i was slightly disappointed about the new features. <br />They are simply not enough of them. When you compare this DVD to some of the others in the shops, then you can't help but feel a little shortchanged. There is so much that Apple could have included, but didn't. <br />The only thing that makes it worthwhile is the improved sound. <br />But having said that, the film itself is a joy. It is funny, and captures the Beatles at a period when they were still young and wide-eyed - at the height of Beatlemania. The songs are fabulous (Cant Buy Me Love, A Hard Days Night...) and even their acting is okay! <br />This film is worthy of a 5-star rating, and I would have given it 5 if Apple put more effort into the DVD features. But as it is, i am going to stick with a 4.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Now,I've seen Hellboy and the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,and those movies had a graphic atmosphere that made the movies so unique in nature,and their directors collaberated with the actual people who made the graphic novels,the movies look like scenes from the comic,and both had dark and unique settings.I saw this movie on dvd,and le tme tell you,I was blown away.It stands as a true translation of an individual product,something that every movie based on something else in the entertainment medium should do,in every case. <br />I loved the seperate part storyline,the actors(My favorite were CLive Owen and Jessica Alba),and the overall feel of the film.If you're not into Gritty Action sequences,traditional Japanese stye swordplay,blood,hot women,and a feel of a comic,this movie is not for you.This is more of a man's dream film,a film that stands out as unique,with polish,nice scenes,and excellent cinematography,along with great direction,awesome soundtrack,and a great atmosphere.This movie should've been praised as a true comic adaption,and not some Hollywood mess-up!A Great Film,and personally my favorite dvd this year thus far!
B00004YTZE|5.0|theres no question that this is the best punk album. this eats the pistols for breakfast, and the clash look like a bunch of women. if you think you like the dolls, you'll actually like this better. this is actually getting a bit of publicity, since \\"pirate love,\\" which happens to be the best song in the universe, is played during a skateboard video by FLIP skateboards for Ali Boulala's part. Walter Lure's songs are kickass too, its not just thunders. It all rocks. buy it you fool, it'll make you happy
B00029LNHS|3.0|Everyone knows \\"Where is the Love\\",\\"Hey Mama\\", and \\"Let's Get it Started\\"; maybe too many people do, for they have been way-overplayed on the radio. Having 3 great top - 40 songs is a great accomplishment, but the rest of the album is just average. <br /> <br />1. Hands Up - A pretty good song. Horns in it add to the exotic sound. 8/10 <br />2. Labor Day ( It's a Holiday) - A song about Labor Day?? Well, its actually a good song. Good song to dance to. 9/10 <br />3. Let's Get Retarded - The original version of \\"Let's Get it Started\\". An unnecessary song on this album. 7/10 <br />4. Hey Mama - I'm sure you've heard it on the radio, and seen the video on MTV. Awesome instruments add to this good dancey song. 9.5/10 <br />5. Shut Up - Another radio hit. Mainly Fergie singing this song. Not my fav. 8/10 <br />6. Smells Like Funk - Like the lyrics. Nice name of a good song. 8.5/10 <br />7. Latin Girls - Don't like this song. Some really love it. Some hate it. 7.5/10 <br />8. Sexy - Another not good song. Doesn't flow well at all. 7/10 <br />9. Fly Away - An alright song. Catchy chorus sung by Fergie. 8/10 <br />10. The Boogie That Be - Above Average. At first, I loved it, but after a week or so, it got old. 8.5/10 <br />11. The APL Song - Basically the same chords as \\"Where is the Love\\" A great song, my personal favorite song on this CD. Cool foreign language in it. 9.5/10 <br />12. Anxiety - Great guitar in this song, great feel to it. 9/10 <br />13. Where is the Love? - Good message, bad justin timberlake, good song overall. 8.5/10 <br />14. Let's Get it Started - Awesoem party song. Very addicting. 9/10 <br />15. Third Eye (Hidden Track) - Unnecessary song again. Nothing good about it. 7/10
B000001FYL|5.0|i loved the movie and loved the music.  my favorite songs on the cd are mircle, blood money, and bang a drum. this is a great cd to listen to while driving. i recommend this cd.
B00005JN5X|3.0|Before reviewing The Brothers Grimm, it might be pertinent to explain the background of the director, Terry Gilliam. Gilliam was born in the United States but has citizenship in Britain, so that probably colors his perceptions of the world a bit more than your usual \\"I live here\\" American.  He's also directed the following films: Jabberwocky, Time Bandits, Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, Twelve Monkeys, and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  And oh yeah, he was part of Monty Python, creating the animations for Monty Python and the Holy Grail. If you can't find a common theme amongst those films, you've got it right: they're all extremely choppy, highly creative, all-over-the-place experiences that include flashbacks, hallucinations, and lots of European humor.<br /><br />That brings us to his latest effort, The Brothers Grimm, an accumulation of all the film experiences that Gilliam has acquired up to now. The plot is almost ancillary; like all of Gilliam's films, The Brothers Grimm is more a collection of scenes and concepts.<br /><br />Our heroes are Wilhelm Grimm (Matt Damon) and Jacob Grimm (Heath Ledger).  Wilhelm is the no-nonsense, practical, warrior type. His brother Jacob is the exact opposite: bookish, introverted, and prone to flights of fantasy.  These two tour the countryside, making up monsters to scare the peasants and using the latest in Medieval (?) technology to pull off elaborate hoaxes.  Then the Grimm brothers ride into town to save the day, shades of Dragonheart.<br /><br />Of course, our two lovable rogues can't get away with this forever.  And so they eventually cross Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce), a French nobleman who doesn't believe in fairytales at all. He wants to put an end to rumors about an evil queen haunting an enchanted German wood in one of his recently conquered territories. Delatombe's chief henchman is the Italian Cavaldi (Peter Stormare), a toupee-wearing gun nut with a penchant for torture. With Cavaldi in tow, the Grimm brothers (or as Cavaldi likes to call them, \\"Grimmi\\") are sent out to do battle with whatever thing is kidnapping the children.<br /><br />Along the way, there are nods to fairytales of all sorts, including Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, The Gingerbread Man, Sleeping Beauty, Hansel and Gretel, The Toad Prince, and probably a bunch that I missed.  All throughout the movie, children are abducted in horrifying ways.  Gretel's animated kerchief lures her to certain doom.  Another child thinks he hears a horse crying out for help and, when he frees it, is snared by webbing from the horse's mouth...then it SWALLOWS HIM WHOLE.<br /><br />It was about this time that I remembered Gilliam's complete and utter disrespect for modern conventions of who you're not supposed to kill or abuse.  Gilliam has never really cared one whit about the unspoken rules of movie plots, such as \\"don't harm children or animals.\\"  Not only are the kids terrorized by scary monsters, there's even a moment when a kitten is accidentally pulped by a torture device.  A bit of gore spatters onto the cheek of Delatombe, who proceeds to taste it.  Mmm, delicious!<br /><br />The most horrifying point in the film is when a young girl named Sasha tries to help a struggling bird out of a well.  She ends up being overcome by the most horrifying goop monster I have ever witnessed on screen.  Every time the goop monster touches her flesh, it absorbs one of her organs.  In this case, it erases her face and manifests two eyes and a mouth.  It's like watching Pink Floyd's The Wall all over again.  Sasha runs around flailing without eyes or a face as this little squat goop monster, grinning maniacally, sloshes after her.  This scene seriously freaked me out. I'm not sure how Gilliam pulled off a PG-13 rating, but this film is certainly not for young children. Come to think of it, maybe it wasn't for me either.<br /><br />The film's sets look completely fabricated and the special effectsaren't quite up to par with today's standards.  Still, that's part of the film's charm, in the same way that Sleepy Hollow was clearly a fairytale.  Gilliam doesn't strive to make the film convincing, though he does filled it with flavor-bad accents, strange lighting, and over-the-top characters.  I don't know if it was a blessing or a curse that my five years of Italian apparently paid off-I could understand what Cavaldi was saying!<br /><br />As it turns out, the Mirror Queen (the delectable Monica Bellucci), holed up in a tower with no entrance, haunts the forest. The Woodsman (Tomas Hanak), a werewolf with a boomerang axe, serves her.  She also has a variety of other critters under her control, including spiders, beetles, and animated trees.  .<br /><br />Opposing the Mirror Queen is Angelika (the equally delectable Lena Headey), a ranger-I mean huntsman-who has already lost several sisters to the Queen's machinations.  She instantly becomes a love interest for the two brothers to squabble over.  She also cast spells of a sort by believing in every superstition, including licking toads to navigate across the ever-changing enchanted forest. Good stuff for a Dungeons & Dragons adventure, actually<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's also plotted like a bad D&D session.  After the first encounter with the Mirror Queen, our heroes are sent packing back to France, whereupon he curses them for failing, threatens to torture Angelika, and then changes his mind and sends them back to the forest again, fully loaded with supplies.  It strains credibility that the evil French Guy would do such a thing, but it seems as if the writer (Ehren Kruger) painted himself into a corner and couldn't figure a way out.<br /><br />And back they go, better equipped to fight the Queen again.  Only to fail.  Again.  And then have the French army arrive (on recently claimed Germany territory, remember), to burn the forest down to the ground.  Which, if you think about it, is really a good idea when you've got problems with monsters in the forest.<br /><br />Things spiral from there and more or less go the way you expect them to go. Bad guys are killed, good guys succeed in spite of their bumbling stupidity, and the climactic moment of the Mirror Queen's return just happens to coincide with every other major plot point.  Given that this movie is about fairytales, that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />But it bears mentioning that The Brothers Grimm isn't as much a crowd pleaser as it is a film filled with Message.  And there are quite a few: fairytales aren't always nice, good people die, and sometimes it pays to believe in your dreams. It's a modern parable about fairytales, how they mirror reality, and the grim reflections that lurk beneath them.<br /><br />Fairytales once served as warnings and parables, to scare children into doing the right thing at the right time.  The Brothers Grimm is no different.  That doesn't necessarily make it a movie for everyone though.pecial effects aren't quite up to par with today's standards.

B00000AOUD|5.0|I thought it was a little difficult to listen all the way through the first couple times. After a few listens I couldn't get enough, and its my favorite of about 12 Tull albums I own. A progressive rock staple. And even the live version rocks (serious shredding from Martin Barre). And it's a song you can say \\"I know all the words to it\\" and it actually means something.
1573300403|4.0|This has to be one of the best MJ videos on the market. I recommend it.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Just like Robert Plant once said...it's good to laugh once and awhile and \\"The D\\" is definitley something to relieve the stress of this war-torn, hateful worl we live in. Plus Metal heads, like myself, get the added enjoyment of just some dame good kick arse guitar playing from Mr. Glass and Mr. Black hods his own too. To me, (I have the CD and the DVD)whnever I feel like laughing and forgetting my stressful day, I turn to The D and bust a gut over and over again. I can't help but feel the essense of a Jethro Tull, Iron Maiden misture going on, sitting on a feather!

B0007TKH66|4.0|CONTENT <br /> Season one of \\"Enterprise\\" was a bold, new beginning for the venerable \\"Star Trek\\" franchise.  Creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga set out to create a new type of \\"Star Trek.\\"  Their intention was to reenergize the declining \\"Trek\\" behemoth by going back to (even before) where it all started.  The result was a prequel that predated even the original \\"Star Trek.\\"   <br /> <br /> There were a number of notable alterations made to traditional \\"Trek\\" with the inception of \\"Enterprise.\\"  Unfortunately, the majority of the fan base felt alienated (pardon the pun) by a number of these changes.  The concept of a prequel did give quite a few fans pause.  There were also some more subtle changes that did garner (in some cases deservedly) feelings of trepidation.  These changes ranged from a lyrical theme song to a letter box format.  Not to mention, there was a great deal more of blatantly gratuitous sex.   <br /> <br /> Despite many of the changes made, the emphasis on the characters being inexperienced, rash, and imperfect (in other words, human) was a wonderful aspect of the series.  This particular feature of the show is probably best exemplified in its first season which, despite earning an abundance of criticisms among the fans, was undoubtedly the finest first season of any of the previous \\"Star Trek\\" series.   <br /> <br /> Being the first humans to venture out into space was an excellent premise which instills the show with a sense of wonder, as everything and everyone is new.  The characters of \\"Enterprise\\" are most certainly accessible to the viewers.  Archer isn't all high and mighty like Picard.  He makes mistakes.  He has problems with his own personal prejudices.  He even has a dog.  In that respect, \\"Enterprise\\" was remarkably refreshing. <br /> <br /> That is not to say that the Archer character couldn't have used some polishing.  Bakula's performance is at times on the weak side.  And he doesn't always portray the rogue \\"Han Solo\\"-like captain envisioned by Berman and Braga.  With that said, his performance is, on the whole adequate, if not a bit rigid.   <br /> <br /> Tucker, the ship's engineer, most certainly embodies what \\"Enterprise\\" is about.  He's your average guy and a little a naive.  He also comes from the school of thought that advocates impulsively thinking on one's feet.  In hindsight, Conner Trineer may have been a more apt choice for captain, as he exudes a stronger command presence. <br /> <br />   T'Pol, at first glance, can be labeled merely T'Pol of Nine.  However, she exhibits character traits that reveal someone who is both brave and loyal.  She and Archer develop a relationship that is akin to the friendship that was between Kirk and Spock. This relationship comes off rather effectively, especially in episodes such as \\"Shadows of P'Jem.\\" <br /> <br /> Dr. Phlox is one of my favorite characters among the crew.  Played with infectious enthusiasm by John Billingsley, he is a new take on the ship's doctor.  His sickbay is littered with various creatures which are employed in multiple capacities to heal the crew.  One criticism, that I have always held since the show's inception, is that Phlox is something of a merging of both The Doctor and Neelix from \\"Star Trek: Voyager.\\"  While it may be a legitimate concern, Billingsley brings a unique character dynamic to the part that would never have been possible with either Neelix or The Doctor.   <br /> <br /> Hoshi, Reed, and Mayweather are all interesting character concepts.  They are also very easy to identify with.  Hoshi is definitely the TV viewer who just happens to be on the show.  She's not as calm and serene as some of the other more seasoned officers.  She gets sick when the stars are going the wrong way and environmental suits make her claustrophobic.  Reed is in a similar vein as Hoshi.  Somewhat uncomfortable in social situations, all he really cares about is his work (blowing things up).  Mayweather is still something of a blank slate and his status as a \\"Space Boomer\\" was never explored to the fullest.  Nevertheless, they are all interesting and, at times, compelling characters.  <br /> <br /> Incredible writing and production values launch \\"Enterprise\\" with the pilot \\"Broken Bow,\\" a sprawling story, that introduces the \\"Enterprise\\" characters and primary villains, in the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise's finest pilot ever.  With a budget estimated by FX Magazine to be at 10-15 million dollars, it is a theatrical quality production.  Indeed, \\"Enterprise\\" displays some of the finest production values ever scene on a \\"Star Trek\\" series.  Completely CG ships and aliens appear on the show on a regular basis.  Additionally, a sizeable number of rather realistic looking sets were constructed for a number of episodes.  Other episodes that display a trend of excellent acting, writing, and production values include \\"Breaking The Ice,\\" \\"Cold Front,\\" \\"Sleeping Dogs,\\" \\"Shadows of P'Jem,\\" \\"Fallen Hero,\\" and the masterful finale \\"Shockwave.\\" <br /> <br />SPECIAL FEATURES <br /> <br /> The \\"Enterprise\\" season 1 DVD box set boasts a fairly large amount of extras compared to other \\"Star Trek\\" DVDs.  Unfortunately, a large amount of them seem padded and trivial.  The audio commentary on the pilot is somewhat interesting.  However, it can be tedious at times.  Berman doesn't have much to say beyond the occasional narrative discussion or how he liked a certain scene.  This leaves Braga to try and figure out things to say.  Some of the tidbits they mention are interesting, and it is worth a watch. <br /> <br /> The text commentaries by Mike and Denise Okuda are for the most part gratuitous.  They are loaded with sometimes obvious and pointless bits of \\"Trek\\" trivia such as \\"A prequel series opened up new ideas for story telling\\" or \\"This scene was filmed on stage 8.\\"  Again, like the audio commentary, there are some interesting tidbits, but nothing to get excited about. <br /> <br /> The \\"O Captain!  My Captain!\\" documentary was a little too sweet.  To coin a phrase by Lt. Torres, it felt like my blood sugar level was going to overload.  I expected an in depth analysis of Archer's character much like the character bios from previous DVD sets.  You wont find that here.  Still, it is obvious that the cast admires Bakula, and he does set the tone for the set.   <br /> <br /> Some of the other feature were blatantly repetitious, however.  The \\"'Star Trek' Time Travel\\" feature is nothing but pointless padding.  Rather than discuss  the Temporal Cold War, a text summary of all \\"Star Trek\\" time travel episodes are included.  From the looks of the \\"'Enterprise' Secrets\\" feature, it's obvious that \\"Enterprise\\" doesn't have too many secrets.  Nothing wrong with this segment except that it is ridiculously short.  The rest of the features are generally good.  However, the highlight is definitely the blooper reel, a hilarious collection of line fumbles and deliberate pranks.   <br /> <br /> The inclusion of deleted scenes is something that is long overdue on \\"Star Trek\\" box sets.  While many of the scenes deserved to be cut, it is a nice touch and definitely bumps the quality of the extras up a notch.  Hopefully, in the next box set the special features will be a little more substantial.  <br /> <br />SOUND/IMAGE QUALITY <br /> <br /> Those expecting an immersive sound experience, should not hold their breath.  Just as the other \\"Star Trek\\" DVD sets, the 5.1 surround emits, primarily, from the center speaker.  However, dialog and other sound effects are perfectly clear.  You may even hear sounds from episodes that were too muffled to be audible when originally aired on UPN.   <br />  <br /> Image quality is also crystal clear.  Scenes were bright and not in the least bit grainy.  It was rather impressive to view \\"Enterprise's\\" CGI effects with perfect clarity.   <br /> <br />PACKAGING/MENUS <br /> <br /> Paramount packed all 25 episodes of season 1 onto 7 rather plain looking discs, though they are not as plain as the \\"Voyager\\" discs.  The packaging is not as awkwardly shaped as the original \\"Star Trek\\" sets or as cumbersome as the \\"Next Generation\\" sets or as fragile as the \\"DS9\\" and \\"Voyager\\" sets.  However, the packaging is a little too elaborate.  In order to remove a DVD one must first crack open the stylish (and tough) silver shell.  One then removes a 7 page plastic DVD booklet.  Then one removes the protective plastic skin that protects the booklet.  Then the DVDs are accessible.   <br /> <br /> As I said, the casing is elaborate.  However, considering the overall poor quality of past \\"Star Trek\\" box set packaging, the \\"Enterprise\\" sets are quite good, as long as you don't mind taking an hour to acquire the DVD, you want.  It also seems a bit odd that the only markings that would differentiate each season box set is in a small crevice on the side.  A nice \\"1\\" stamped onto the front under the title would have been nice.    <br /> <br />     The menus, which are excellent facsimiles of the control panels seen on the starship sets, are beautiful and functional.  They are definitely the finest menus Paramount has slapped together for the \\"Trek\\" box sets.  We can also be thankful that someone had the foresight to make the \\"Enterprise\\" menus the only ones that don't have the theme song playing in the background. <br /> <br /> If your a fan of the show, you will most certainly enjoy this box set.  If you are new to the franchise, \\"Enterprise\\" may be the show for you.  This box set is certainly an excellent introduction to the world of \\"Star Trek.\\"
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica really haven't been doing well lately, especially after the release of their highly disappointing \\"St. Anger\\" Studio Album, which quite frankly is only recognised as Metallica because of James Hetfield's lyrics. However, I went through my Metallica collection the other day and popped \\"Ride the Lightning\\" in and all I can say about the CD is: pure, unmitigated musical genius...<br /><br />This album, released in 1984, was the last album featuring the guitar stylings of the legendary and talented Dave Mustaine (he went on to form Megadeth in 1985 after he was thrown out of the band). Now I also love Megadeth, but the reason I think this is Metallica's best album ever is not because of Mustaine or any other member, but because of the way each member is at their absolute peak on this offering! \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is simply one of the greatest Metallica songs ever. The riff chugs away, the guitars shriek and roar, the drums are masterful and Hetfield's lyrics are deeply penetrating. The song actually talks about Death Row and and an inmate awaiting execution by the electric chair and honestly, this song makes you feel like you ARE that inmate! And dear lord, have you heard the solos on this song? Holy s*** it's so beautiful that you just wish you could be those guitars! The structure is complex and there's a real storyline to the song which creates interest and a sense of progression. Simply masterful Metal.<br /><br />\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" has also got to have one of the best openings in a Metal song. The Church Bell combined with the guitars and drums sounds amazing. This is then followed by a \\"solo\\" bit by Mustaine over Hetfield's killer rhythm that just sounds incredible. Once again Metallica demonstrate their Metal prowess with their awesome solos and meaningful lyrics. Once again there is a sense of progression in this song and the idea of the journey that every human has to take: the journey from life to death. It's simply fantastic Metal.<br /><br />\\"Fade To Black\\" has some beautiful acoustic guitar work and some very moving solos. The song isn't as hard and heavy like the other songs but still retains a darkness that is the mark of early Metallica. It is once again masterfully crafted and is full of energy and emotion. The guitar work overall is simply wonderous and the lyrcis are once again emotionally-charged and intelligent.<br /><br />My personal favourite song from this album (and favourite Metallica song ever) is \\"Creeping Death.\\" It's just so brilliant and has a unique and direct energy that is the epitome of Metallica's speed metal and musical capability. The lyrics are reminiscent of Biblical scriptures and the lyrics created a foreboding and ominous atmosphere. And the end solo is the single greatest solo I have EVER heard. Three guitars play as the solo reaches it's climax and it's simply one of the most haunting and memorable solos ever recorded. The song is incredible and one that I will never forget.<br /><br />\\"Ride The Lightning,\\" is undoubtedly a Metal Masterpiece. It is a shining example of what Heavy Metal should be: powerful, unforgettable, moving, dark, heavy, complex, intelligent, innovative and plainly extraordinary. If you're a Metallica fan you HAVE to own this album. Buy it, you will NEVER regret your purchase. If you like your metal masterful and classical, then Metallica's \\"Ride The Lightning\\" will more than satisfy your desires. I could go on and on about this album, but you just have to hear it to understand it all. 10/10 for Metallica's 1984 Metal Masterpiece, \\"Ride The Lightning.\\"/> <br />\\"Fade To Black\\" has some beautiful acoustic guitar work and some very moving solos. The song isn't as hard and heavy like the other songs but still retains a darkness that is the mark of early Metallica. It is once again masterfully crafted and is full of energy and emotion. The guitar work overall is simply wonderous and the lyrcis are once again emotionally-charged and intelligent.  <br /> <br />My personal favourite song from this album (and favourite Metallica song ever) is \\"Creeping Death.\\" It's just so brilliant and has a unique and direct energy that is the epitome of Metallica's speed metal and musical capability. The lyrics are reminiscent of Biblical scriptures and the lyrics created a foreboding and ominous atmosphere. And the end solo is the single greatest solo I have EVER heard. Three guitars play as the solo reaches it's climax and it's simply one of the most haunting and memorable solos ever recorded. The song is incredible and one that I will never forget.  <br /> <br />\\"Ride The Lightning,\\" is undoubtedly a Metal Masterpiece. It is a shining example of what Heavy Metal should be: powerful, unforgettable, moving, dark, heavy, complex, intelligent, innovative and plainly extraordinary. If you're a Metallica fan you HAVE to own this album. Buy it, you will NEVER regret your purchase. If you like your metal masterful and classical, then Metallica's \\"Ride The Lightning\\" will more than satisfy your desires. I could go on and on about this album, but you just have to hear it to understand it all. 10/10 for Metallica's 1984 Metal Masterpiece, \\"Ride The Lightning.\\"

B0007Y08QA|5.0|What would happen if you hadn't slept for a year?<br /><br />That's the basic premise of \\"The Machinist,\\" a film about a man who can't sleep, hasn't slept in a very long time, and is finding that it's having some pretty deletirious effects on him, both physically and psychologically. The reasons why he can't sleep, and why the people around him are acting so strangely, are brought into gradual focus as the story progresses.<br /><br />Christian Bale plays Trevor Reznik, who as the movie opens has been suffering from insomnia for quite a long time. Physically, he's wasting away. The closest thing he has to a girlfriend, a sympathetic hooker in the form of Jennifer Jason Leigh, says to him early on \\"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist,\\" and it's true -- he's looks like a walking skeleton, every bone visible under a layer of skin, tightly stretched over his frame. Mentally, Reznik seems to be slowly losing it. He gets easily distracted at work, and an accident caused by his distraction costs a co-worker an arm. He begins to see things and people who don't seem to actually exist...or do they? Increasingly, as the story unfolds, we see that Trevor can't trust his own senses. Is this a by-product of the insomnia, or something deeper than that?<br /><br />Bale's performance is incredible, probably the best of his career. The fact that his bony frame isn't digital effects -- he really lost all that weight for the film -- is impressive enough, but Bale's portrayal of the perpetually exhausted, edgy, increasingly paranoid Reznik is even better. In every scene, even when Trevor is in good humor, you can see exhaustion in his eyes, the tattered edges of his conciousness showing through. He looks and acts like a man who hasn't slept in a long time. But it's not a one-dimenaional performance at all, as we see that Reznik can be a charming and friendly man, even underneath all the layers of sleeplessness. His emotional responses to different scenes are right on the money, and his growing confusion is clear throughout. It's a perfect performance and it drives the movie.<br /><br />The other essential aspect of the film is the mood it sets. The early visuals of Reznik's wasted body are enough to make even the most jaded viewer wince, and sets the movie on an off-kilter stance right from the start, which only gets worse as it continues. The lighting is stark and grainy, and the colors are washed-out, often either too bright or too dark than what you'd normally expect. Lots of little details add to the growing feeling of unease in the film, the overall sense that something is seriously wrong here...why is it always 1:30 when Trevor sees a certain waitress from an airport cafe, what do the six letters mean in the Hangman game that appears on a Post-It note in Trevor's apartment, why does he pay the rent early but forget the utilities, and was that just blood leaking out of the fridge?!<br /><br />There are several surprises waiting at the end of \\"The Machinist,\\" and to say much more would ruin it. Suffice it to say that this is a film which gets it all right. It tells a compelling story, it sets a definite mood, and it cements itself in the brain even when its over. For those willing to brave the deepest chambers of the human heart and see what waits there in the darkness, this is not a film you'll soon forget.oney, and his growing confusion is clear throughout.

B00006NSGX|5.0|I love this concert--(I have the DVD and the CD). I was also able to attend EC's Crossroads Guitar Festival in Dallas last year, and to hear him (and an unbelievable list of other greats). Billy Preston, who appears in 'One more car...' was there and showed himself to still be the master of the Hammond B3 (as he does here). Clapton was as astonishing in person in Dallas as he is on this DVD/CD. No one could ever accuse this multiple grammy award winner of being a one-hit wonder. For forty-plus years he has grown, experimented, responded to life, and in general evolved musically. On rare occasion he has gone places musically that I didn't particularly care to go with him, but we all grew from the experience, and he is, today, a consummate musician who doesn't have to live in his own (or anyone else's) past to have relevance. Critics who fault him for things like ending this concert with \\"Over the Rainbow\\" just don't get it musically. This song so belongs to another artist that, frankly, I don't expect anybody to be fool enough to cover it. Clapton carries it off beautifully, and makes it his own. This guy is not just a rock/blues guitar player. His musicality is too great to allow him to be pigeon-holed like that. At the Crossroads Festival, I saw him, within the same day, perform with B.B.King and Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, and Carlos Santana. He sounded at home with everyone--and at times, he was pushing them musically, not just following them. Sadly, some people have such a narrow band of musical intellect, they can't tolerate musicianship that could stretch them if they would but let it. Pay no attention to the poor souls who long for Clapton to be who he was musically when they first were blown away by him. Buy this concert (I recommend the DVD for the visible interplay between the band members), open your ears and your mind, and experience a joyous, virtuostic performance by a man who doesn't need to cling to one style and who isn't afraid to still be a work in progress.
0312305060|1.0|I read this book a few years ago, after reading two of Cunningham's other, good novels, and all I could think of while reading this was \\"What, is this guy trying to win a Pulitzer or something?\\"  You see, every year at Christmas my best friend gets me a Pulitzer prize winning novel, and I read it.  With the exception of \\"Kavalier and Clay\\", which was excellent, the novels were all souless, bitter, poignant and oh-so-dramatic clunkers from hell.  They would employ obvious intertextuality with the \\"greats\\" of the past, showing \\"ordinary people\\" in the depths of their misery, grapling with suicide.  They revealed the hidden sorrow of these plain old folks and how, surprise-surprise, no one else knows they are deeply troubled.  These unhappy souls, as a matter of course, resort to chemical substances or a rich and eccentric fatasy world to soothe their over-the-top mental anguish.  These novels have a formula that combines Thoreau's adage about \\"men leading lives of quiet desperation\\" and the Rolling Stone's song \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" and keeps continuously repackaging these two bits of wisdom together to churn out what are themeatically the same novel over and over again.  It's hardly novel - it's simply a tragic retelling of the same tragic tale.  My impression was that these novels could all have been written by the same person, or by a group of writers trying to write as if they were the same person, like the ghost writers of the \\"Nancy Drew\\" or \\"Hardy Boys\\" series.    Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\" fits perfectly in with the other Pulizer Prize winners.  I did not actually THINK it would win a Pulitzer when I read it, it just seemed like the kind of novel that always wins.  I had assumed that  because his earlier novels had been either trashy or completely within the confines of \\"gay lit\\" that he wouldn't be considered.  But I guess the overwhelming similarity of this novel to the other previous winners was just so compelling that the judges could overlook Cunningham's earlier indiscretions and give out the award.  Maybe they thought his trying to be interesting and entertaining was just a phase, one that he has now grown out of, and he will now remain tastefully in the confines of that fine tradition of safely imitating classics that have already had the life sucked out of them by previous generations of writers and critics.    The sad thing about this novel is that the novels and people of a century ago that it is trying so hard to get in touch with were true outcasts in their time.  The crappy literature of the turn of the century, the stuff that won all the awards back then and the critics loved, is largely forgotten today because it was deriviative, pretentious crap that no one would want to read.  Instead, the stuff we love today from that era, like Virginia Woolf, was the same stuff your parents would have beaten you for reading back then.    No one's parents would be upset at your reading \\"The Hours\\" -you will be commended for your obvious good taste and depth of sensitivity.  Oh my, Virginia Woolf, I have no idea who she is but I just love her stuff!    I'm not saying we should only be reading novels that our parents would want to beat us for reading, but FOR GOD\\"S SAKE those are the novels we should be awarding Pulitzers to!    I know this reveiw will make some people a little angry, but I was very off-put by this book (well, obviously) and a lot of the reviews.  Especially, the theme I saw in a lot of the Amazon reviews was that \\"Virginia would be proud!\\"  I suspect Virginia would actually be all pissed off that a guy with obvious talent is wasting his time trying suck a few drops of blood out of her corpse instead of writing something daring and original.  Feel free to email me ([...]) with your ideas or hate mail, I am open to reunderstanding this book.

B0009MAP9A|5.0|I can't possibly se why anyone would think that this album isn't considered one of his better ones among more people, I later albums , songs most always had a story or a point, but in this (The TImes They Are A-Changin') the point is always made crystal clear, as if more ignorant people never understood the first 2 albums (even though the first album was mostly just plainer folk standards) but it seem that he wanted to get more poeple to understand what he was about, and he drove it home with The Times They Are A-Changin'...........crystal clarity, and once these people were like, \\"They, this guys got a real message!\\" I do believe that this album is responsible for getting him a lot more attention at the time.  <br /> <br />Anyways, you really can't question Bob anyways, he is the master!

B0009A1AS2|4.0|I was one of the few who thought that Train of Thought was a masterpiece of metal.  It was heavy, loud, dark, and in your face.  I would have been perfectly fine if their next CD sounded like that, but fans complained, and DT is never a band that sticks with one style. <br /> <br />So what about Octaverium?  Well, the first time I heard it, I didn't really know what to make of it.  Most of the CD is much more poppy and radio-friendly than anything the band has released before, with the exception of Falling Into Infinity (my least favorite DT release.)  This CD is drivin more by Jordan Rudess than John Petrucci, which dissapoints me, I loved his wild solos on ToT.  'The Answer Lies Within' recalls Images and Words for me, which actually isn't a good thing.  You heard me right, I thought Images and Words was the cheesiest CD I have ever heard, and I hear that same thing creeping through my speakers when I listen to this song. <br /> <br />'I Walk Beside You' is also pretty lame, but not as bad as TALW.  I actually enjoy the lyrics here, and they manage to be poppy and uplifting without sounding like a self-help book. <br /> <br />The two songs that recall ToT ('The Root of All Evil', 'Panic Attack') absolutely blew me away.  Heavy, menacing, and fast, these songs really are what I think DT should sound like more often.  I suppose I can still get my fix of heaviness with 'Awake' and 'ToT.' <br /> <br />'These Walls' is also definately one of the better ones on here.  AWESOME keyboards, AWESOME lyrics, and emotion that doesn't sound made-up.  It's actually catchy, without sounding like something that would make it to radio anytime soon.  It would be cool if it did, though. <br /> <br />I have mixed feelings about 'Never Enough' and 'Sacrificed Sons.'  Both are fairly boring until those crazy insturmental sections kick in about halfway through.  I think they just need some time to grow on me, because they are not bad by any means.  I've heard the lyrics to 'Never Enough'have to do with how Mike Portnoy feels about his fan's constant complaints about the band's changing sounds.  Either way, the lyrics are pretty harsh.  'Sacrificed Sons' is about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and as good as LaBrie sounds on this track, I can't help thinking \\"A few years late, guys!\\" <br /> <br />Now, the final track, 'Octavarium.'  This is the longest single track the band has done to date, and it's quite good.  After a long intro, an orchastal section kicks in, and it just sounds fantastic.  The middle section of the song sags a bit if you listen closely, you can really hear some nice keyboard work by Jordan Rudess.  The song picks up pace again in the 4th movement, with LaBrie stringing together random cultural phrases and icons.  It gets even better in the finale, with screams of \\"TRAPPED INSIDE THIS OCTAVARIUM!\\"  AWESOME climax!  The song then slows down a bit and glides into the end, exactly 24 minutes after it began. <br /> <br />So, in summary, this is definately a good album by DT, and a good started for someone new, because it's a bit more poppy than the others.  It's no 'Scenes From a Memory', 'Awake', or 'Train of Thought', but it is definately a worthy addition to any fan's catalog. <br /> <br />Great Songs: <br />The Root of All Evil <br />These Walls <br />Panic Attack <br /> <br />Good Songs: <br />Never Enough <br />Sacrificed Sons <br />Octavarium <br /> <br />OK Songs: <br />The Answer Lies Within <br />I Walk Beside You <br /> <br />My ranking of DT's CDs: <br />1. Scenes From a Memory <br />2. Train of Thought <br />3. Awake <br />4. Octavarium <br />5. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance <br />6. Images and Words <br />7. When Dream and Day Unite <br />8. Falling Into Infinity
B000003TAR|1.0|The only media MTV whores at Nirvana shows were the band members themselves. They didn't practice what they preached, that's for sure. Cobain wanted the four Litt-remixed songs, in particular \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\", to \\"sound perfect\\". And the demand that HSB \\"sound perfect\\" was made by none other than Cobain himself. He told Steve Albini when he wasn't satisfied with result of his bare-bones recording. Cobain said he didn't want it so \\"stripped down\\". Hey, a spoiled multimillionaire drug addict wants what he wants. Coming from a former Nirvana fan (yes, most of us Nirvana fans outgrow the band and their whining eventually), I must say all of this. I've read CaYA and Journals. Cobain wasn't a complicated man. He was a self-centered imp to begin with, and his bipolar disorder just added to his brattiness and moodiness. Multiply that with the millions of dollars he never deserved, and you've got a dumbassed, mentally-unstable rockstar who toyed with his fate at the expense of destroying the life of his family and daughter. For the previous reviewer to say Cobain was a victim is sick. Millions of dollars made his life a paradise. And to think: Frances Bean will never see any of the fortune she once had set aside by Cobain. Most of her trust fund money went towards bailing out Courtney Love from her drug/assault escapades in court. Chain-reaction of bad karma for the Cobain family, I guess.

B00009L1UP|4.0|Empire was my first exposure to this band. I was 16 and a typical teenager of the time but did not care for much of the Bon Jovi, Poison, and Warrant CRAP music which was ruling the airwaves. Queensryche offered something different. Intelligent lyrics, great intricate guitar work, a powerful rythm section and a vocalist who has a voice as distintive as a fingerprint. Resistance, Silent Lucidity, Empire, and Anybody Listening were then and are today still great pieces of music. Silent Lucidity really is Queensryche's best song taking a clear Pink Floyd influence and making it distinctive and truly their own.  <br /> <br />I admit  some of the songs sound a little too 80's generic love/relationship songs like Hand on Heart, The Thin Line, and Jet City Woman the latter having great Zeppelin style guitar in the begining of the song. Only One is a love song of the era but saved by great dual guitar work from Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton. Empire proved to be Queensryche's most mainstream album while keeping the classic Queensryche sound they found on Rage for Order and kept through the very dark and beautiful Promised Land. Empire truly is a great even though not quite classic album form a band that in 1990 was at the top of their game comming off their masterpiece landmark  album Operation Mindcrime.  <br /> <br />In conclusion Queensryche has always I think been just fine with the notion of being different from the typical norms of Hard Rock, Heavy Metal, Alternative, and Pop Rock and while critics and many of their loyal fans seem divided about their albums they have continued to make music with emotional depth and a musical quality which will always have a loyal even if thin fan base. I do think the loss of the unique Queensryche sound on albums like Rage, Mindcrime, Empire, and Promised Land did hurt them with fans and critics however their latter work still has some good material and flashes of true brilliance. Empire is definately worth a purchase.
B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jams much anticipated sophomore release was extremely popular, breaking records for fastest selling albums in a day, and week all over the world.  Why it is looked down upon by critics remains a mystery to me.  This is the best place to start if you're new to Pearl Jam, giving you some of the harder, grunge sounding songs (Go, Animal, Leash), and some of the softer sounds that would later define their career (Daughter, Elderly Woman, Indifference). <br /> <br />Honestly, the only track that I would EVER skip over on this album is Blood.  Vedders' lyrics and vocals are as passionate as they would ever be, Lashing out against the record industry (Animal, Blood, Leash), covering Social and Racial issues (W.M.A., Daughter), and stories about his own life (Rearviewmirror, Elderly Woman). <br /> <br />This album is the defining moment of Pearl Jams career (well, along with Vitalogy and No Code), where they expand their songwriting, showing that they shouldn't have been placed in the very vague \\"Grunge\\" genre, and begin to speak out against the music poseurs (whom Eddie knows as the fans who were just into them for Ten) and against the media. <br /> <br />This is my second favorite album from Pearl Jam (first is No Code), who also happens to be my favorite band. Easily one of the best albums of the 90's.  I assure that upon picking it up, you will not be disappointed. Enjoy.

B000002BFZ|5.0|Pearl Jams fourth studio album might be the least accessible of them all, but I, and many other Pearl Jam fans consider it to be their very best. Vedder and bandmates were seemingly off in their own world for Vitalogy and No Code, providing us with something totally new and unexpected. Vedder shines on this album, not in a vocal way, as in other albums, but his beautiful lyricism and songwriting were at a peak. Incorporating his Eastern influences, he once again brushes off all of the media and mainstream attention they had early on. Touche. <br /> <br />Jack Irons is added to Pearl Jams' ensemble on this album, replacing Abruzzese (sp?) on drums. He is excellent, the drumming on Hail Hail, Who You Are, and In My Tree is near perfection. Once again, Vedders lyrics are based upon all the struggles he faced as a child and during adolescence.  Lyrics in the songs Off He Goes, In My Tree, Sometimes, and Present Tense paint a vivid picture of his emotions. By listening to Smile you can get a sense of how much of an influence Neil Young had been on them (they worked with him on and album, and Neil played guitar on \\"I Got ID\\"(great song)). McCreadys' guitar work on Red Mosquito reminds you just how badly the man can tear up the geetar (in a good way ;). In Off He Goes, Vedder preaches the story of a man (supposedly himself) struggling to fit in and find his own. It is, without a doubt, one of the finest songs Pearl Jam has ever Produced. Lukin is a punk song, in which Vedder must have gone hoarse. Mankind and I'm Open are the weakest off the album. The first hardly sounding like a Pearl Jam song (I think Gossard sings), and the second with Vedder reading some strange poetry over music (The song I'm Still Here, which is very rare, shows Vedder putting this affect to a much greater use).  The album closes off with Around the Bend, a beautiful song where nothing is rushed.  Very good song to lay down to sleep while listening to. <br /> <br />This album is way to underappreciated for everyones own good (I think it has been the worst selling Pearl Jam albums so far). Probally not the best place to start if you're new to Pearl Jam, but anyone who is a fan of 90's alternative rock should enjoy this fine output from Pearl Jam. <br />

0684803356|5.0|Set during the Spanish Civil War, Ernest Hemingway's \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American who is serving as a demolitions expert for the Republican cause.  The novel follows his experiences with a band of guerrilla fighters as he undertakes a mission to blow up a strategic bridge.  The whole novel, except for some flashbacks and reminiscences of various characters, covers just a few days.<br /><br />Although the novel focuses on a small number of characters in a fairly compressed time period, Hemingway attains a real epic feel with this book.  The novel is fairly lengthy (471 pages in the 2003 Scribner edition), but I found it to be a swift read--indeed, often difficult to put down.  There is much that is noteworthy about this novel.  It offers a compelling perspective on war from the viewpoint of guerrilla forces, rather than conventional forces (interested readers might want to check out Mao Tse-Tung's \\"On Guerrilla Warfare\\" for some theoretical and historical perspective).  The novel also deals with the phenomenon of ideologically committed foreign forces in Spain's Fascist-versus-Republican conflict.<br /><br />Hemingway deals with the issues of love and sex in a combat zone, as well as with the roles of women in a guerrilla force.  Other significant issues include loyalty, leadership, communications, military hardware, the impact of weather and terrain, and the connection between guerrilla and conventional forces.  Particularly interesting is Hemingway's portrait of Robert Jordan as a technically and tactically skilled guerrilla fighter, and as a leader of guerrilla fighters.  Thus the book should interest not just lovers of literature, but also serious military professionals and students of the history of warfare.<br /><br />Hemingway offers a grim and graphic look at the brutality of 20th century warfare.  War is not glamorized or sanitized, and atrocities are described in unflinching detail.  The characters explore the ethics of killing in war.  As the story progresses, Hemingway skillfully peels back the layers of Jordan and other characters to reveal their psychological wounds.  But the book is not all about pain and violence.  In the midst of war Hemingway finds the joy and beauty that keep his characters going.

B00005N9CV|4.0|I love her voice and her piano. The only thing that is negative about this CD is the \\"canned\\" intros to several of the songs. They sound like something from somebody's 1975 home electronic organ with rhythm selection. On the other hand, her version of \\"Maybe You'll Be There\\" is to die for. If you can get past the first 20 seconds of each song, this is a killer CD.
0060977493|5.0|My 2 other favorite authors are John Irving and T.C. Boyle.  While not really similar to their styles, Arundhati Roy has been added to my list. <br /> <br />This book is mind-blowingly well written and beautiful.  I read it first in high school in a literature class.  The discussion of the class helped me to understand its complexities, and after I spent some time with it, I realized that it had become my favorite book.  It offers great insight into the Indian caste system; it delves into the concept of \\"love,\\" and it is a wonderful storytelling adventure.  Best of all, the writing is up there with the most unique, enticing, and beautiful language I have ever read.  I read the last page and immediately flipped to the first to begin to read the book over again. <br /> <br />I am dying for her to write another novel!
B00008RH3L|3.0|Yes, I only gave this wonderful film three stars. Wait! Before you go down there and click on the \\"No\\" portion of the \\"Was this review helpful\\" section, let me explain why I rated it this way ...<br /><br />Let me tell you about the positive sides of watching this movie. First, it's a Coen brothers film. Second, behind the camera, also, was Barry Sonnenfeld, the excellent cinematographer of almost all of the Coen brothers' movies. His wide angle shots and muted colors and shadowing are pure eye-candy. Third, an excellent ensemble cast graces the screen (Gabriel Byrne, Albert Finney, John Turturro, Marcia Gay Harden, etc.).<br /><br />So you might be asking, \\"What's not to like!\\"<br /><br />Well, the negative aspect -- and there really is only one, but it's a BIG one -- is that the film has no point, no plot, no secure message. So when I finished viewing the film, I just continued to stare at the screen thinking, 'Okay. That was pretty to watch. But WHY did I watch it?'<br /><br />Some might argue that it's a crime-noir film designed to show the metal of a man, and how his own personal code during the prohibition wars between rival \\"gangs\\" made him stand out above the rest. But, at the end of the film, he kills an unarmed man (I won't tell you who it is, though). Where did his personal code go then?<br /><br />Still, this is a beautifully filmed movie. And Gabriel Byrne, although not having much of a message to get across to us, is excellent, as is Albert Finney.
B0009W5JS2|1.0|Oh my gosh, my entire family is hysterical because we can't believe we paid to rent this CHEESY movie!  It was so stupid,we couldn't believe it!  The ONLY good thing I can say is that our entire family was laughing so hard we could hardly breathe. This movie should not be rated; if there was a zero star, I would have give it that rating.  I could make a better movie myself using a lower budget and better acting.  \\"The Mariachi\\" had a $7,000 budget and it was a zillion times better.  How much did this piece of junk movie cost?  I'll tell you what, I'm so upset I missed \\"Stargate SG-1\\" show to see this nonsense!  Stargate SG-1 has better effects.    <br /> <br />Rent this movie for the following three reasons: <br />1.  You are a film student and want to know how NOT to make a movie; <br />2.  You need a good laugh; or <br />3.  You have people over that you don't like and you want to get rid of them.  Believe me, they will all say \\"goodnight\\" early rather than being subjected to viewing this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001FS3|1.0|This album is nothing but overblown, pseudo-spiritual baby food.  Most everything in U2's catalog before this album is groundbreaking and intensely interesting (even if uneven).  This is where Bono and the boys stopped being a rock and roll band and started to become second-rate preachers.  This album is nearly unlistenable, failing utterly to rock in any way whatsoever.
B000001F9N|5.0|This album contains the full uncut version of Barry Manilows' \\"Could it Be Magic.\\" This album is one of the <br />few that sets the tone for the Disco Age..This was cutting <br />edge when new..the new sound we hoped would last forever..Donnas'voice does'nt really get a work out here <br />but it is very good disco music..

B0002IVN9W|3.0|I had no idea what I was getting into when I decided to purchase this.  About two months ago I had purchased The Woods by Sleater-Kinney and I was looking for something that was of a similar type of energy.  I definitely got what I was looking for as far as how the music sounded overall, yet subject matter is quite depressing, I must say - although I guess that is to be expected with a CD titled Funeral.  Lyrics are quite clever, yet the overall feel of the vocals in the album is general discontentment with life.  I do enjoy the album, so I'd recommend it to anyone in the mood for something different.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have read most of the other reviews on this page. They run the gamut from begrudging tolerance to a downright obnoxiously snotty kid's review.  So why all the poison?  People usually act this way when they're discussing politics or religion.  What the heck's going on here? <br />  Something amazing. Most people come away from this work deeply impressed, moved and transformed for LIFE. They feel it is THEIR musical. It is a totally personal, life-changing revelation. It MUST always be the way they experienced it the first time. Hence all the negative rhetoric about the film not being enough of this or that, as opposed to the original cast stage version. <br />  Not all musicals achieve such status. Chances are \\"Phantom\\" will touch you as deeply as it did me. <br />  Perhaps you will feel as I did when you see this DVD...that the music and singing are glorious, you will feel that the songs were always a part of you, that the camera seems to lovingly caress every sumptuous set and costume,  that the story is poignant and moving beyond tears.  <br />  The film is stunning on its OWN terms. I for one love it (yes, in spite of having seen the stage production and loving it too.)  Let the crabby-appletons out there grouse their heads off. The film is wonderful.
0312965788|5.0|Wonderful stories about farm life in rural Engkand as Herriott lived it, as a young veterinarian. His stories are amusing and \\" feel-good\\" all at the same time.  Great stories for all animal lovers.
0312323859|5.0|This book was better than its prequel Something Borrowed.Romantic with lots of surprises! <br />Its the kinda book that leaves you wanting more and hoping the author would write another in this series with a possible title Something Old .I would love to see more from the characters in this novel. <br />Great PAGE TURNER  that i finished in one day and looking foward to more from this writer. <br />
B000001G1E|5.0|I hate box sets.<br /><br /> Most recently, I was extremely disappointed with the Nirvana box--which contains very little of the vital, infectious music that I associate with Nirvana. While it may be unfair to compare Nirvana's b-sides and outtakes to the best material in the James Brown catalogue, I can't help but be underwhelmed by any box set that doesn't have the words \\"Star Time\\" printed on the cover.<br /><br />I don't really even consider this a box set. I think of it as four of my favorite individual cd's. Each cd plays like it was originally intended to be sequenced that way by James Brown his own damned self.<br /><br />Yes. Discs one and four may not be quite as solid as numbers two and three. But that's a little bit like saying that Abbey Road isn't quite as good as Revolver. It's all good people.<br /><br />Amazon lists other cd's as the \\"essential\\" recordings of James Brown. While Foundations of Funk is an excellent compilation, this is a better place to start your JB education.
0761536434|5.0|I found this book very easy to read and entertaining.  It gives a wonderful insight into the video game industry circa early 1970's through around 2000.  Wonderful interviews with the \\"big hitters\\" of the industry including the creator of Atari, the person who headed up Nintendo of America, etc.  Well worth the price.
B00000K31V|1.0|The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is not the worst movie I have ever seen.  If you enjoy seeing people put their tounges in holes in other people's backs, this movie may be for you.
B00005JN5X|1.0|What can I say? This movie was terrible. There were long, boring dead spots in the film that in no way deepened the plot. The plot was shallow, poorly explained and hinted at a lot of various fairy tales, but never explained. If you're ten, this movie might be ok. If you're above that age, it's terrible, long and boring. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their money on this.
B000002UAX|1.0|I dont care if someone think I am crazy for saying this but I never felt there were any oustanding songs on this album..Skip this please because when they made this album they were past there prime.
0060516070|5.0|I've read many of Peter Drucker's books and I've always come out of it with my mind refreshed with new insights. The Effective Executive is another jewel of a book: it is of modest size but every sentence gets you thinking, brings some AHAs and makes you wish you had read the book earlier ! Peter Drucker has a gift for clear, no-nonsense thinking and limpid writing. This book is a highly recommended reading !
1400032717|3.0|I really did not like this book to much, though it was okay I felt that it was a waste of paper. The Author put way to many graphs and maths in the book and I felt like I was reading a text book.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|It was only a matter of time before The Stooges albums got to this stage and they did a beautiful job...... never sounded better! <br /> <br />The Sound is nice and crisp with this version of the album which lacked on past release of the album. From the opening rift of 1969 to the end of Little Doll the atmosphere is what makes this cd worth it. Disc One is really what your paying for but Disc two is the surprise thats thrown in full of bonus tracks  <br />including 5 original John Cale Mixes, full versions of both Ann and No Fun really make this set a no brainer!
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I knew before I bought this album it was going to be great, I prepared myself for a little bit different style, but a little bit of the same sound. This is going to make it a three way tie for album of the year for me, along with 'Cold Roses' by Ryan Adams, and 'Aha Shake Heartbreak' by Kings of Leon. Hopefully this won't be their last album like they announced at the end of last year. I recommend, if you are a fan, or are curious, buy this album. It's perfection.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I actually had this cd since it was released, and only now am writing a review.  This cd is the best.  I think it's the best cd of 2004.  Just an overall new and exciting music experience.  This band is talented and not one bad song on the entire thing.  I also saw them in concert back in November of 04', such great live performers as well.  This cd sends chills up my spine.
B0000013GT|5.0|I got this album a year ago. I still listen to it frequently. I listen to it to wind down, or when im sad. or while i do my homework. also good car music..perfect car music, i must say. Because I cant think of anything bad about this album, i will say any fan of hip-hop will like this album. guaranteed.  <br />the beats are solid. the lyrics are amazing at times. the atmosphere is perhapse legendary. <br />Jazzy Belle and Extra Floor are my personal favorites.
B00005JNTX|4.0|When Sin City came out to the theaters I really wanted to see it but I waited, even though friends told me it was good. Well I borrowed it from a friend and finally watched it. Let me say, I was not disappointed. The movie told a interweaving story of three or four characters...and it was very engrossing. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because of all the narration, it was alright but could have delt with a little less of it. The black and white added to the \\"old school\\" feel and overall it was wonderfully made.
B00079FUI6|1.0|Teri Hatcher killed this series for me.  Just playing the stupid, incompetent woman with a child more mature than her got more and more pathetic as the show wore on.  I watched every episode, hooked on what was happening with Bree, seeing a lot of reality in Lynette and wishing the \\"Carlos and Mrs. Carlos Show\\" would finally develop some depth.   <br /> <br />The only thing they could do with Hatcher's Susan character in the end was put an even less intelligent, less mature character in to play her mother, thus giving her an excuse and making her seem like a human being for two episodes. <br /> <br />In the end, this show was only good about every other episode, and sometimes went two weak weeks consecutively before the writing picked up. <br /> <br />The other factor that contributed to the boredom many have experienced with the show is that it repeated itself.  The big revelation about why Mary Alice killed herself happened three times in the show, and they still tried to play it as a surprise on the final episode of the season, when we heard it for the third time. <br /> <br />This show punished loyal viewers by making them sit through the same material multiple times.  I'm glad it's over. <br /> <br />Great pilot, good second episode, mixed blessing from there on in.  I won't be watching series two.
038551123X|4.0|In Lindsay's debut he shows some experamentalism and excitement with his witty and blunt style.  His alliteration and strange plot lines make this a truly satisfying novel.  While not a masterpiece by any means the novel is very enjoyable and worth buying.  Lindsay shows promise and hopefully the sequels really shows his talent.
B0000DG00B|5.0|I have listened to this album now around 8 - 10 times, and I believe it is absolutely terrific! These two performances, one at the start and one at the end of the 1970 Atlanta Pop Festival, are equal in skill and excitement to the Fillmore East concerts. Most of the old favourites are here, including some rarely heard live. There are some very minor audio flaws in a couple of songs in the live recordings, but the rest of the recordings are of a very high calibre. <br /> <br />I especially like the first part of the Mountain Jam on disc 2 - probably some of the best ABB ever! <br /> <br />If you love the Allman Brothers, DON\\"T WAIT, JUST BUY! and enjoy forever!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I love Slipknot,and this is the album that got me into them.now that ive listened to their other records i see this is more diverse...in a very good way.theres all that grinding metal attitude but some slower stuff as well.Every song is awesome,but some stand out--Circle,Vermillion[Pts.1 and 2],Duality,Pulse of the Maggots,Danger Keep Away,and my absolute favorite slipknot song ever,The Blister Exists.Heres a song by song rating- <br />1.Prelude-simple in lyrics and structure,but addictive.you just have to listen to this.5/5 <br />2.The Blister Exists-my absolute favorite slipknot song ever.awesome drums and grinding guitars on this.5/5 <br />3.Three Nil-good pounding metal but not my favorite.4/5 <br />4.Duality-a classic.every one likes this.5/5 <br />5.Opimum of the People-good song.havent listened to it much.4/5 <br />6.Circle-this is one of the best songs on the album.5/5 <br />7.Welcome-i love this song.its grinding metal.5/5 <br />8.Vermillion-another classic.this has the greatest lyrics and perfectly blends slipknots metal and softer sounds.5/5 <br />9.Pulse of the Maggots-an awesome tribute to slipknots awesome[lol] fanbase.5/5 <br />10.Vermillion Part2-cool cool cool song.5/5 <br />11.The Nameless-my friend lilly's fav song for a good reason.it goes from pounding metal to melodic harmonies with no warning.its awesome.5/5 <br />12.Virus of Life-if one song's lyrics scare me,its this.its still a cool song though.5/5 <br />13.Danger Keep Away-this slower song is very haunting in a very good way.it kinda makes you think.5/5 <br />please buy this album.its classic.but not everyones gonna like it i know.as corey taylor[the singer] says, slipknot's an acquired taste.
B000002KKC|5.0|This album represents the efforts of one of the most innovative bands of the time period. It is truly a \\"musicians\\" album, and not for the casual \\"pop\\" music listner. Maybe that is why it never really managed to become a big seller due to the fact that it really was too involved and complicated for the average pop listerner to appreciate. From what I understand, the songs were written in and experminental style of using two keys. To illustrate this...try to play any of the songs \\"by ear\\" on a piano....it is impossible to find a key. Most striking is the guitar counterpoint and slide work on \\"Storms\\". It is in a word, breathtaking, along with the electric piano work circling S. Nicks vocals. This album is a must buy for anyone who truly appreciates fine musicianship.
B00000ADG2|5.0|this camed out around the time when i had just finished college that following summer.so its pretty significant to me and my friends (along with outkast's aquemeni).this is a great album that has influences from reggae,soul and hip-hop.its truely a msterpeice of a album by a great artists.of course i was a fan of the fugees so it was only natural that i check this album out.and boy i wasn't dissapointed at all.basicly every song on here has something to say.this album have good messages and good intentions however i do find the album teetering on the edge of being preachy and borderline judgemental.but MUSICALY this is a great album wether you agree with he messages or not.also lauryn hill's voice is so strong and bluesy that hit hits your soul like a ton of bricks.alot of people say this along with floetry's floetic is the direction hip-hop/soul should have went in.and i cant really say that i disagree.though lauryn is a fusion of hip-hop/soul.other artists are usualy hip-POP/R&B so theres the difference.either way this was a great album of the 90's along with other outstanding albums that camed out of that decade.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|Only four stars.  Don't get me wrong, Donnie Darko is one of the great films ever, and that's no exaggeration.  And this Director's Cut is even better.  Five stars plus.  But the \\"Director's Commentary\\" extra is abysmal. <br /> <br />For a movie that cries out for in-depth analysis by its visionary creator, the choice to have writer/director Richard Kelly be \\"helped\\" in his commentary by friend Kevin Smith is epically misguided.  Self-centered Smith just won't shut up about his own movies, Mallrats, Dogma, and Clerks.  Some may say these are fine movies,  but I for one have no interest in how any scene in Donnie Darko is \\"just like what I did in MY movie, Mallrats.\\"   Kevin Smith, your movies aren't even in the same league.  Richard Kelly can't seem to get a word in edgewise, and the result is an annoying and frustratingly unenlightening commentary. <br /> <br />By all means watch Donnie Darko - The Director's Cut.  Go to donniedarko.com for further info, but spare yourself the commentary on this DVD!
8478885196|5.0|Definitivamente mi favorito de los seis. Es, a mi parecer, el climax de la serie completa: cuando te enteras de cosas, cosas, y ms cosas. Cuando todo -o bueno, \\"todo\\" con Rowling es como al 15% de el real \\"todo\\"- hace click. Es cuando Harry pasa de ser un nio, a un adolescente. Me es imposible expresarlo mejor, porque de esa manera terminara en un mes, pero lanlo y suerte.
B000667FN8|5.0|Great cd. Terrific band. Would definetely buy their stuff again.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Ok listen up.....reading these reviews has gotten my blood boiling......This band is the greatest band around musically, creatively, and ya know what....these days, VOCALLY as well.  If you want to hear some poser whine with a nasally voice about how much he loves his girl or how much he hates love then yea, you probably would think foolish thoughts of Sevenfold. <br /> <br />Now onto the real review.  First off, yes, Shadows did get a cyst on his vocal chords and have to have surgery for it.  He then trained with the same vocal coach that trained Axle Rose and other top singers in the music biz.  If you don't like Axle's voice then I am to assume you are so blinded by this fake emo rock that you wouldn't know rock n' roll if it came and slapped you upside the head, which....is exactly what this cd does.  Shadows still CAN scream, he just chooses not to because ya know what....the GREAT rock vocalists of our time didn't scream either. <br /> <br />I personally like \\"Waking the Fallen\\" better than \\"City of Evil\\", BUT \\"City of Evil\\" will change the face of metal as we know it.  Every song on this cd is different than the next, each having its own personality if you will, which makes for a diverse, technical, and pulsepounding metal/rock record. <br /> <br />Axle, Sebastian, the GREATS....would be proud of this cd.  Break away from the nu-metal and emo-rock.  Enjoy the attitude of hard heavy rock/metal because that is what rock and roll is all about.  ALL PRAISES TO A7X, believe me they are due.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This CD is absolutely brilliant. I've never encountered a prog masterwork like this one. The musicianship is excellent, especially from Rudess and Petrucci. The solo work is fantastic. The solos are exciting, creative and technically enchanting. I love this album. Glass Prison is a great rocker and Petrucci's seven string guitar work is beefy and deep. Myung's bass licks in the first cut are unbelievable too. Blind Faith is pretty good, Misunderstood is great, but the cut that makes Disc 1 is The Great Debate. The song is well written, well produced and well thought out. I love how it makes such a bold political statement about Stem-Cell research and clips of people's opinions on the issue are played in the background of the band's intense building intro and fading, tapering ending. The second disc is the reason to buy this album though. To call the work Six Degree's of Inner Turbulence a song would be insulting to Dream Theater. The piece is a Magnum Opus taking up the entirety of the second disc and running at about 45 minutes. The 8 movement suite is staggering. The writting is incredible, the elasticity of the piece is infinite, and the story that it tells is incredible. The piece is dynamic on every level, themes are recalled and embellished throughout and the way the piece fits together as one entity is astonishing. All the solo work in the piece is also amazing. This album is a must have for any Dream Theater fan. Buy it!!!

B00003CXXP|4.0|I am not one to join these general online forums.  It has to be something very compelling or meaningful for me to break this rule of thumb.  So it was that I joined Amazon membership primarily to write a cathartic commentary and critique about this amazing movie, A.I.. <br /> <br />I had seen this movie in the theater when it was first released in 2001 because, unlike the rest of the pure garbage we get from Hollywood, it looked precisely like the kind of complex movie for which it is worth risking $9 of my already wrongly heavily taxed money.  I admit that I did not grasp fully back then the sophistication of the movie's message.  It just hit me like a sledgehammer 4 years later in August of 2005, some days ago, when I saw it for a second time. <br /> <br />I say my writing here is cathartic because my parents divorced when I was a boy of 8.  My mother left our family.  It fostered and strengthened in me resentments against her throughout my life that I had not realized were tearing me apart underneath miles-deep layers of denial or distraction. <br /> <br />We spent the overwhelming majority of the last 10 years without speaking to each other.  I could not understand how she, as the mature adult, could not make a stronger effort to stay in touch no matter what angry words I fired at her, especially because it was her decision that brought me into this world.  My anger would have eventually subsided if only she had tried a bit harder as the adult above my desire as a rebellious, rude teenager to be alone during her visiting rights.  I wish she could understand that it had far more to do with wanting autonomy at that stage in my life than rejecting her. <br /> <br />Her apparent indifference only reinforced my resolve.  Out of principle for how I would never treat my own child, I had even resigned and prepared myself psychologically to accept that she was dead to me even though this, even now, is not the case. <br /> <br />This movie forced me to a crossroads that Ihad not expected.  While I still carry this justified resentment, I feel terrible that I feel it for my own mother who--of all people--I wish could understand how very real and distinct was my disillusionment over her departure and how she could have mitigated it.  Even this last reflection causes me great distress as I type it. <br /> <br />I offer this background to illustrate that our reactions to this movie, A.I., will definitely be influenced heavily by what experiences we have had in our lives. <br /> <br />I gave this movie 4 stars out of 5 to acknowledge the valid criticism about its incontinuity of mood and plausibility during the middle.  It is true that the movie took an annoying departure from the up-'til-then superbly dramatic mood it had set in its first third.  It is true that Spielberg could have made the fictional \\"orga\\" society that disparaged \\"mecha's\\" a bit more realistic and less flashy as he had done so well in the first third.  It is true that the second third lingered a bit too long in this detour.  But even this section had its saving graces.  This section was indispensible for the message of the movie to depict the lopsided, even unwarranted conflict between two different groups and how not everyone on either side was as dumb or shallow as they seemed.  In fact, the reaction to this movie itself indicates on what side of the conflict's fence the viewer would likely have fallen had he been written into its script! <br /> <br />This critique aside, the final third of the movie fully recaptured and surpassed the mood it had previously lost, in time to matter.  It happened at about the point where David set out to meet his creator accompanied by Gigolo Joe who tried giving David some lessons in the ways of the world in a way that earlier his adoptive mother admitted too late she wished she had done at the moment when she forever abandoned her adopted son in the woods.   <br /> <br />I found Frances O'Connor's portrayal of Monica, David's adopting mother, to be truly disturbing and right on the mark.  She was a woman capable of despair, callous calculation and soft, loving sweetness all in the same movie.  Haley Joel Osment was exceptionally brilliant as her son and main character, David, for reasons you really must see for yourself.  Though Jude Law's character, the experienced Gigolo Joe, was dramatically certainly nothing out of this world, he was the \\"voice\\" of the necessary additional dimension so critical to making the viewer seriously reevaluate the parameters of what we, as humans, have considered \\"human\\" up 'til now.  How could \\"real\\" humans be so capable of destroying beings who(?) had evolved into emotional \\"parity\\" as demonstrated through their capacity for fear, pain and love?  Again, what does this say about the critics who \\"didn't connect\\" with David merely because he was \\"not real\\"?  Have they no capability to adapt a protocol to conditions that will minimize suffering in other entities?  The very way I ask that question is intentionally robotic. <br /> <br />Here was a boy who, whether by programming or not, had nothing but pure affection and enthusiasm for his adopting mother.  He would have achieved happiness only to hear her say that she loved him.  His mother, on the other hand, truly did not understand the nature of what she was unleashing when she decided to speak the words that would encode David's affection solely for her forever, even long after she was dead.  The foreboding question's prediction came to pass when David's creator was asked something to the effect of, \\"It's not whether artificial creations can love humans but if humans are capable of loving them back.\\" <br /> <br />Had the movie ended with David trapped in his hover copter with \\"Teddy\\" and that longing stare at the Blue Fairy, I would have been greatly disappointed that it really went nowhere. <br /> <br />In fact, the movie's message was NOT complete, in my view, UNTIL the element of far-future time was introduced, and WITHOUT descriptive text at the bottom of the screen.  It was NOT complete until we saw future \\"mecha's\\", who obviously outlived all the \\"orga's\\", rescue David from his icy grave and, thanks to extremely advanced technology AND human(?) compassion, were able to give him, whether real or not, what he had single-mindedly sought his entire life, even if only for one brief moment in his indefinite existence. <br /> <br />Stop reading now.  The next two paragraphs will spoil the dramatic end for you if you want to give the movie the chance to show you instead of reading about it through my words here. <br /> <br />The end began its crescendo of sadness when Monica and David interacted throughout this entire single day like never before in literally thousands of years, even though David understood that it would end by nightfall as his rescuers had warned him. <br /> <br />This crescendo of tears reached its peak as we saw a smiling David holding his never-to-be-woken-again mother's hand on the bed while ultra-brilliant composer John Williams's piece \\"Where Dreams Are Born\\" interlaced with Barbara Bonney's sweetly melancholy lyricless voice played as the camera receded from their peaceful scene, and the lights dimmed one by one from each room of the house. <br /> <br />This movie was a love story, though not at all the kind most would suspect.  It had, by far, the most unforgettable, gut-wrenching ending I have ever seen in my life.  I still have flashback pangs of sad reflection days after watching it.  I think Stanley Kubrick would have been proud of what Speilberg did by taking his creation in an equally or MORE interesting direction. <br /> <br />Having said all of this, I close by highly recommending this movie to anyone with a brain but, more importantly, a heart and a little patience. <br /> <br />As for me, I will send this critique to my mother in the hope that it will make permanent reconciliation a likelier possibility.
B000002UAX|3.0|THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM. But it's definitly not the masterpiece everyone here is talking about. Coming off a somewhat dissapoing album in the form of SGT PEPPER...I expected the beatles to released something very good...but they didnt..but this is still a decent album..however...dot expect to get blown away.
B00007JVBI|4.0|I didn't put this in and instantly adore it, but it's grown on me over the past several months. It's the sort of CD that seems like background music but then you discover how deep it goes. Don't expect stunning vocals (i.e. Kate Bush) but do expect to be blown away by the intensity of raw emotion. This is an excellent example of treasure buried deep- worth the effort.
B0000025F7|1.0|This album is worthless. What's up with the hype. I could not find one song that I liked...Horrible album bes avoided. Rock With you is a decent song but the rest is terrible.
B000002JS6|5.0|well wut can i say about this album, except HOT DAMN!! everytime i press play i can enjoy this classic without it ever getting old.
B000003TA4|1.0|This is some depressing music that make me wanna commit suicide. Nirvana, one of the most self loved and overrated bands ever. How ROLLING STONE ranked them higher than the WHO in their 100 best artists list is a mystery to me. AVOID PLEASE AND KEEP YOUR BRAIN CELLS FRESH.
0452282152|4.0|Overall a good weekend read, much like the classics.  But Chevalier could've built up the sexual tension a bit more between Griet & Vermeer.  It was not as powerful as it could've been, in my oppinion.  I was glad, however, that she chose to have them \\"consumate\\" their relationship only by doing the painting and wearing the earrings rather than ever actually consumating in the \\"old fashioned way.\\"
B000000W5N|4.0|This is a great stones classic. But there is one song that I HATE...it's \\"You Got to Move\\" which is probebly the worst song the stones ever recorded. Other than that..the rest of the album is fine.
0618001905|5.0|Many of us who have read Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" think of it as an allegory tinged with racism--a tale of a European, Kurtz, who has abandoned the restraints of civilization and has surrendered himself to the barbaric despotism and primitive rituals innate to Africa. Yet Hochschild spends a full chapter of his excellent history reminding us of the novel's historical context: the figure of Kurtz is based on at least one real-life colonial administrator, and the barbarity is not one that is indigenous to Africa but imported from Europe. Conrad's contemporary readers understood that his novel was a condemnation more of colonial tyranny rather than of African primitivism.<br /><br />And the ringleader of these gang of hoodlums who invaded the Congo and massacred its inhabitants was King Leopold II of Belgium. In a tour de force of characterization, Hochschild  portrays Leopold as a petulant and greedy monster who decided at a young age that the way to wealth was ownership of an African colony and the subjugation of its inhabitants. Leopold initially made his profits through the exportation of ivory, but his bureaucrats struck gold with the expansion of the international rubber market.<br /><br />The victims were the natives, who lost not only their land and their freedom, but often their lives. There is no pretty way for Hochschild to tell this story: Leopold's officials used unbelievably harsh methods to force the locals to collect rubber--all in the name of bringing them European civilization, Christian charity, and a Western work ethic. In addition to taking wives and children hostage (in subhuman conditions) until the men made their quotas, soldiers would torture or kill the inhabitants if they faltered. One of the most grisly aspects of this calculatingly orchestrated version of modern slavery was the severing of hands--and their collection into baskets as proof of killings--as a means of terrorizing the population. The wonder of it all is that Leopold and his agents managed to keep most of these deeds secret and even disguised his colony as a charity for the benefit of \\"pagan\\" African natives.<br /><br />Yet Hochschild's narrative is not simply a gruesome account of the horrors of Leopold's personal fiefdom--which the king himself never once visited. The most fascinating part of this tale is the creation of what might reasonably be called the world's first human rights movement. George Washington Williams, the first and perhaps bravest campaigner, initially sounded the alarm, but he was ignored largely because he was African American. Later rabble-rousers had better success: E. D. Morel, whose suspicions were aroused when he noticed the imbalance of trade to the colony while working at the docks; William Sheppard, a Presbyterian missionary who provided first-hand accounts; and Roger Casement, a British consul who became an important anti-Leopold activist (and who later became an significant figure in the Irish independence movement whose closeted homosexuality provides a sad coda to his life's story).<br /><br />One of Hochschild's themes is astonishment, only a century later, at the world's amnesia (including his own) regarding these atrocities. Even the thousands of annual visitors to Laeken's Royal Greenhouses and Winter Palace, Leopold's extravagant and luxurious monument, do not realize that this park was literally built with the lives of millions of Africans. Fortunately, thanks to Hochschild's best-selling book, as well as similar reassessments published by European historians during the last twenty years, even the briefest biographical accounts about King Leopold II now portray him as he was: a brutal and gluttonous colonial thug.eopold and his agents managed to keep most of these deeds secret and even disguised his colony as a charity for the benefit of \\"pagan\\" African natives. <br /> <br />Yet Hochschild's narrative is not simply a gruesome account of the horrors of Leopold's personal fiefdom--which the king himself never once visited.

B00004SZWD|4.0|This is definitly stevie at HIS BEST!! But there are some filler like the instrumentals but the rest are wonderfull. I recommend it.
B000002TQV|4.0|I was looking through the reviews to see what others had to say about The Bends, most seemed very credible, until I got to some guy saying 'This isn't real music, real music is Led Zeppelin, Nirvana, (the usual), etc. I can't understand why certain people are unable to appreciate new music as well as old rock and roll and blues etc. I hold my Howlin' Wolf and Taji Mahal records in the highest regard, yet I can still enjoy Brian Eno or U2 or Talking Heads. I'm sure most true music lovers could say the same. There is no such thing as 'fake' music. There are 'fake' artists, but in the end, all musical judgement is a matter of opinion, I suppose. Well, I like The Bends. Personally, I find a lot more in Kid A and Amnesiac, but I am 100% certain the majority would disagree. I respect that. The Bends is full of well-written, memorable songs. It's quite accesible. (Nice Dream) and Bulletproof are too of my favourites, and I love Bones. It's electrifying. All the singles are classics, too. Some parts are lacking in something, but I don't know what. The one part that makes me cringe for some reason is that bridge in the title track with the 'I wish it was the sixties' lines. I dunno, it's just a very un-Radiohead breakdown, in my opinion. I would definitly recommend this album. High & Dry and Fake Plastic Trees are songs you will probably adore. It's an original rock album and there aren't many of those, so cherish it. It proves that Radiohead could push the bounderies of popular music even without drum machines and samplers. So, check this out. If you dig it, go through each of the following albums in order of their release, for their sound becomes more of an acquired taste as they progress. The one album to avoid is Pablo Honey. Although it does document their musical origin, it does not rank alongside any of their later works. So, I personally hope you will soon be listening to and enjoying Kid A and Hail To The Thief, but for now, start with this.
B000002UAU|1.0|This album is a rip off Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. The beatles copied Pink Floyd and this is the reason why Pink Floyd are better. Simply a weak and disgusting effort. Best avoided.
B0006957SA|5.0|Take a poet and songwriter like Shane MacGowan, give him seven top-class musicians, three bottles of Powers and a few thousand fags - what could go wrong? Nothing, that's what. Before this The Pogues had already went through two great eras - the early punk 'let's get pissed' era that spawned 'Red Roses For Me' (1984) and the sloppy fantastic drunken youthful coming of age that produced 'Rum, Sodomy & The Lash' (1985). What the band lost after this was Cait O'Riordan, who was a very powerful part of the bands style and image. So then, what they did, was become professional. They became great, so to speak. If I Should Fall From Grace With God is a masterpiece, in the non-pretentious meaning of the word. It is a piece by a band who have mastered their sound. MacGowans voice was at its peak - a raspy lived-in beautiful... thing. Look at the classic soon-to-be standards he wrote on this - Lullaby Of London, The Broad Majestic Shannon, Fairytale Of New York... . The covers are magnificently performed. Birmingham Six is defined, as is Galway Races. Fiesta is a great party tune as well. The playing is something else, it wipes the floor with their older performances, technically anyways (some may prefer the punky bash of old). But enough of the deep observant writing... Above all this a great album to crack open a can or pop a bottle and sing along and learn the words so you can carry these songs with you and sing them in pubs until your dying day. 'Let me go boys, let me go boys, let me go down in the mud where the rivers all run dry'.
B000002KGT|3.0|This album is good....but why buy it when you can hear half the songs on radio? It's played everyday...there is no reason to buy this unless you wanna die of boredom since almost all of the tracks are played to DEATH on radio.
B000002GY9|4.0|Sometimes Tom Wait's 70's stuff sounds something like if you read Jack Kerouac over Kind Of Blue-era Miles Davis. If that's not enough to tempt you, he also has ballads that are musically rich, lyrically depthful and heartbreakingly beautiful all at once. Small Change is probably the most all-round example of this. If you want extremes, buy Nighthawks At The Diner for the former and Blue Valentine for the latter. Lot's of these tunes are already the stuff of legend - Tom Traubert's Blues, the title track, I Can't Wait To Get Off Work - but a lot of the gems on this you probably haven't heard of. I Wish I Was In New Orleans is perfection, no other word for it. Some may call this music too maudlin, too schmaltz - including Waits himself - but if you ignore the cynic inside of you, what you'll find is something that's not like any other record out there. There is no such thing as a bad Tom Waits record, and I'm not usually one to make such fanatic claims. Nowadays he's doing this great, mysterious, musically challenging and innovative thing. In the 80's he was mutating his 70's work into something very unique and magic indeed. In the 70's he was making music that made his world yours, completely sensational. Every song on Small Change is like a novel, every note is like gold. Listen to Invitation To The Blues, Bad Liver & A Broken Heart, Step Right Up - from ballads to beat, this guy is a heavyweight. Always has been, always will be.
B000002KBU|1.0|I am sorry but this is definitly one of the worst albums ever. I couldnt find one good song on the whole thing but I bought it anyway because I though I had to like this album but I listend to it 2 times straight through and didnt like it....well then CRTISIZE my personal taste...not my rating. <br /> <br />I dont recommend this album.
B000002L71|5.0|When he came out in that big suit and started with the funky chicken type stuff.  Man, I'm still laughing. Great music too.
B0000C8AVM|2.0|I dont care if someone think I am ignorant or anything but I never felt this was a great Dylan album. Many call this his best but I beg to differ. Definitly NOT his best...but not his worst either. Average album with 3 great songs...the rest are ok..not great.
B0007P3582|1.0|His name may be 50 cent but this new album is worth 25 cent.
B000000W5L|4.0|This is definitly their best album!!...Better than the above average \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and the overrated \\"Let it bleed\\"..all the songs here are great except probebly 3...that's it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Everything about this movie is great. The story is an updated version of the Homer classic, although not modern day. The music is my favorite part of all, it's hard to find a movie with a Bluegrass-Gospel soundtrack.
B000002TQV|1.0|First, what does Radiohead mean? They're a moderized version of u2..nothing more...nothing less.
B000002GQH|4.0|That is, I'm not going to give this \\"core 7\\" Moodies outing 5 stars despite the fact that I use one of their best songs as my reviewer tag.  It's simply not as good as the others, and that is that.  Still, it yields good enough things to make it a solid 4.<br /><br />It is interesting that this album opens so onimously with an individual being challenged by the establishment which means to asphyxiate the belief that any one person is capable of thinking for themselves, and even more remarkable that our computerized society fits this mini-dialogue with such clairvoyant fruition over 35 years later.  In spite of some bright tunes on this album, there is also enough negative aura off the opening to affect most everything else on this album unless you play the tracks in shuffle mode or skip a few.<br /><br />\\"Lovely to See You\\" is indeed an odd sort of segue from that intro, but it's a great, positive Justin Hayward song that almost seems to be saying you will need to return to this song after your journey with this album is through.  By itself, this is a good rocker and one of the songs buying Threshold dignifies.<br /><br />\\"Dear Diary\\" is a rather creep-along, yet quietly whimsical contribution by Ray Thomas that sounds a bit as if it could fit onto Days of Future Passed.  The song almost contradicts itself in tone as he has a rather cavalier attitude about not being where he should have been, then begins to wonder what's happening to his indifference and wonderment at the blindness of others:  \\"It's over, will tomorrow be the same?  I know they're really not to blame.  If they weren't so blind then surely they'd see there's a much better way for them to be.\\"  What always strikes me is at the very end when he mentions \\"Somebody exploded an H-bomb today, but it wasn't anybody I knew...\\"  If nothing else about this song caught your attention, THAT will!<br /><br />Here's where we slip into some territory that weighs the validity of this album being a classic down.  I am convinced that the only reason this album is regarded as such is because it's part of the 7, and on its own the following tracks would leave it in the dust:  John Lodge's hippie country offering, oddly enough, while okay to listen to as a track is pathetically weak and should be left to somebody like the Monkees' Mike Nesmith who had a natural gift for that style of writing.  \\"To Share Our Love\\" is simply one horrible song that sounds like the band is singing one thing and John is yelling another song over them.  The word discordant comes to mind, and these are some of his worst contributions on any Moodies album that I can think of offhand.<br /><br />Mike Pinder is not to be outdone in the not-so-hot offerings either.  \\"So Deep Within You,\\" in spite of very good, direct lyrics and some of Mike's sharpest vocals, still manages to suffer from an ennui that's saved only by Ray Thomas's flute that's punctuated by Graeme Edge's percussion.<br /><br />By far the best songs on Threshold are Hayward's beautiful \\"Never Comes the Day,\\" a simple song about a couple that needs to try harder to take their love easier as they seem to have let life get in the way a bit--at least that's my interpretation--and Ray's \\"Lazy Day,\\" a sympathetic little tribute to the English mothers who make Sundays such a delight each week for their families.  Best of all, though, is Thomas and Hayward's \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably,\\" truly beautiful and uplifting in every way as it charms with its magical lyrics about Merlin and Camelot.  You are really able to lapse into a vivid daydream, except the song is too short!<br /><br />Pinder's little three-part opus, \\"Have You Heard 1 and 2 with  \\"The Voyage\\" in between, was so strange to my ears the first few times I played it that it took a long time to decide if I liked it at all.  I do understand that it ties the album together neatly when you go back to the introduction.  The song acknowledges that we share the same world, we are real and free.  Something of an answer to the establishment that would try and  mold us all into the same mindset.  By the time you come out of this track, however, and to the end of the journey, you are gasping for the air and sunshine that was semi-obscured by the initial tone set for this disc.  Herein also lies the problem with the album.  The concept is a bit choppy, so you are never quite sure with the lighter songs what the point is.  I guess that the point is to read into the lyrics yourself and interpret them your own way.  I feel this one is a bit all over the place in spots, but there are still enough great songs here to make this a valuable addition to your Moodies collection.  If anything, it will set your mind into a contemplative mode.e real and free.  Something of an answer to the establishment that would try and  mold us all into the same mindset.

0312330529|5.0|I can't recall how I came across this book, and none of my friends have read it (though I hope to change that). I don't recall hearing much buzz over it, in fact. So I approached the book with a blank slate and a hint of skepticism. I  quibbled with little things and big things in this novel as I read, but at the same time, I never wanted to put it down. To me, this book is what reading is all about. At times, I found myself yelling at the protagonist, Lin, \\"No, don't do that! Don't go there! What the f*** are you thinking of!\\" At other times, it was like I was having a dialogue with the author. I felt as though I was there, in Mumbai, and that the characters were my friends and comrades. To me, that is the joy of reading. <br /> <br />I can't think of another book I've enjoyed reading so much in the last few years. Like others, I'm at a loss for what to read next--nothing else really holds a candle next to this book.
B00005JN5X|4.0|-Brothers Grimm- is  a rapid-paced romp thru the dark & creepy [& creeping] woods.  Matt Damon & Heath Ledger are *great* as brothers who con their way thru French-occupied Germany, preying on peasants' superstitions.<br /><br />Then  the French arrive, & it turns into a snore fest [literally; Donald fell asleep!].  Bye-bye French & again the gallop resumes as 11 young maidens [about 6 years old maidens!] are kidnapped by a vain & evil witch queen, for a spell to restore her beauy, ravaged by a plague.  Until - yep! - the French return & the snores resume.<br /><br />This is an enchanting yet sinister farce, nearly perfectly crafted by Terry Gilliam. I just wish he'd left out the French; altho they're led by Mr. Dark himself, Jonathan Pryce,  they're just too stuidly rational for this dark fantasy...
B00005JN5X|1.0|For 3 generations our families children were read stories from the Grimm Brothers.  Then when i was a child myself i saw on the huge Cinerama screen \\"The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm.\\"  What a wonderful piece of work and it has become a part of my collection of Videos until it's released on DVD. <br /> <br />This new version is a drug trip gone wrong in Hollywood.  There is NO WAY you could ever take a child to see this film.  He would be scared out of his mind.  What has gone so wrong in Hollywood that they can distort wonderful literature.  Those people in Hollywood are getting more and more pervertly sick in every way.  No wonder people are not going to the movies like they use to.  To me, it shows how the Hollywood film makers looks at life. Everything to them is violent.  I was just going to say something bad about Terry Gilliam, but then i would be just as guilty as he is.  This is the beginning of the end for Hollywood.

B0006L16N8|5.0|We (the masses) are beginning to sift through music catalogues like we do through bad television-compliments of the Internet and good old file sharing software-and nowadays we are finding and listening to music that-up until ten years ago-would've taken a thrifty record store road trip to get hands on. That being said, we can literally find albums that tailor to our exact touch-which makes good mainstream rock sound like an evil profiteer. Granted, a majority of the mainstream music scene is in fact garbage. But what does any of this jargon have to do with Coldplay? Everything.    Coldplay are not innovators. They are not the experimental prowess that is the Mars Volta and Radiohead or pop revivalists (ala Oasis) on a mission to save music. They are a simple quartet who do a damn good job at writing cool, uncomplicated tunes-and occasionally getting their artless feet a little wet. Unfortunately, they were blown into bobble-headed, ironically iconic radio heroes.  The fact that we now have access to such an array of music makes it easy to compare and contrast. So what we have is a sea of people downplaying a powerful album in an anti-hype movement-and the few skeptics that do give it a chance listen to it with such muddled expectations that the whole disc rubs them wrong anyway.     So what about X & Y? The album is packed with fine cuts of music that demonstrate growing potential without being overly dramatic. Starting with \\"Square One\\"-a song that clearly draws inspiration from Radiohead and exhibits a slightly new direction for the band. \\"What If\\" is a standard ballad, but even at their most mundane, their songs make a lasting impression-like a Picasso. \\"Little White Shadows\\" is Coldplay's first synthesizer driven tune-and wait-we can actually tap our feet to this one. \\"Fix You\\" is the \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"Higher Speed\\" of X & Y-definitely the standout track. By now we should all know that Chris lifted Kraftwerk's amazing \\"Computer Love\\" riff and made it \\"Talk.\\" So what-the song is eons from mocking our German friends of Kraftwerk and it doesn't sound cheesy. What about Rap-where classic songs are literally cut-n-pasted onto computer beats? For instance, I just heard one of Ray Charles' best songs from his Atlantic years layered into a hip-hop bonanza. I wonder who sold them the rights. In terms of ingenuity, \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" isn't a breakthrough song. But it's one of those songs that can subliminally unify people-in a fun, nostalgic kind of way. \\"Twisted Logic\\" exploits the darker side of Coldplay and finds Chris Martin doing his best Space-Oddity era impression of David Bowie.    Martin uses melody unlike any artist in the industry-and that's not an opinion. He doesn't covet overboard super-hooks that become high school anthems or abuse the \\"what's right\\" pop formula as a safety blanket for success. Instead, he extracts melodies that are available and existent to us all--then turns them into beautiful-occasionally haunting-explosions of self-expression. But if you aren't into their sound or this style of music-then turn away. Too many people argue X & Y lacks passion, inpiration and ambition. Funny, since it empowers the patient  listener with just that.         \\"What If\\" Coldplay were riding the Indie-Rock tidal wave with Death Cab For Cutie? \\"What If\\" they took more chances like Radiohead did? \\"What If...?\\" Yeah, then they'd probably be more appealing to the critics, seem more adventurous to the cynics and play longer, more personable shows for the fans. But that's the nature of the big label business. So in the end, if this review conveys anything-it's to just take music for what it is, and not for what you'd prefer it to be. You're not jumping onto a \\"bandwagon\\" when you like music for what it is-especially if it's in the 90th percentile.
B00001QGPR|4.0|surprisingly at near epidemic proportions is this new disease. <br />also known as being a person with no musical taste. <br /> <br />I think this is a very good album.  while not particularly groundbreaking or as experimental as his other works i.e. Earthling 1.Outside. or diamond Dogs <br /> <br />i have no idea why anyone would compare this album to Hunky Dory the two are completely different. <br /> <br />The most comparison I can find is maybe the Deram anthology and that's mostly reffering to the rather understated instrumental accoutrements. the musical accompaniment in hours is actually much more interesting than that of the Deram anthologies as well. <br /> <br />i think survive is an absolutely beautiful song. <br /> <br />This album though is a bit of a sober melodramatic one. <br /> <br />I personally like that, but other people not so much. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this album quite a bit.
B00005JN5X|1.0|I knew in the first five minutes that this movie was going to disappoint me.  It took only another 45 for me to realize that it was more than disappointing, it was despicable.  I walked out and received a full refund immediately following the ridiculously non-sequitorious cat-puree scene.  But the things I noticed before that, which should have been a clue were:<br /><br />A) PACING: The movie goes by at such top speeds that you can never feel anything for any of the characters because they aren't on screen long enough to have any substance.  Finally I got tired of trying to keep up -- literally.  I fell asleep during a scene where I think they were fighting a wolf, and my friend had to nudge me awake.  There are flashbacks within flashbacks, for no reason at all.  This film was clearly edited by a pack of trained monkeys.<br /><br />B) SETS & COSTUMES: All look like sets and costumes.  Nothing is natural.  Everyone's clothes are perfectly shiny and clean and new, fresh from the costume warehouse.  The houses and storefronts are freshly painted and not even rain-damaged.  It all looks as fake as it is, which didn't help me get into the story either.<br /><br />C) ACTING: Flat or over-the-top, with absolutely no in-between.  I barely understood a word Peter Stormare said the entire time I was there.  And the sad part is that even when I didn't understand it, from the first line he had, I already didn't care.  Everyone else's lines seem out of context and rushed.  The accents are horrendous.  The movie's supposed to take place in Germany but Matt Damon sounds like a person faking a British accent.  His performance was heartbreaking; I truly thought Matt Damon could do no wrong.  But it was bad.  So were all the rest of them.<br /><br />D) MUSIC: The same uninspired schlock every movie has these days, complete with a woman wailing in the background.  Grating.<br /><br />E) GORE: As others have said, it's out of control.<br /><br />Is this really Terry Gilliam?  Mr. Counter-Culture?  Couldn't ANYBODY tell how horrible this movie was before they made copies and released it to the unsuspecting public?  What a waste of time and money this movie was -- for both me AND the people who made it!  If you HAVE to see this one, do yourself a favor and wait for the rental!e this movie was before they made copies and released it to the unsuspecting public?

0596007124|5.0|This is the best introduction to design patterns I've seen.  The authors present each pattern in the context of a problem.  The \\"obvious\\" solution is considered first, and then its pros and cons are discussed.  The code is then redesigned to use a pattern, and the advantages of the new design are explained.  The entire book is very clear, and uses examples that are easy to understand. <br /> <br />This book doesn't cover as many patterns as the classic \\"gang-of-four\\" book, but readers who are getting their first look at design patterns will get much more out of it.
B0001I55NS|5.0|It was surely a refreshing and innovative approach to love and war, where loyalty is the true and clear backbone of all the wonderful and magical successes in the story. It even, dare I say frightfully in the 2000nds, inspires you to be loyal as well. I have only watched once but am waiting with great anticipation for another turn, given the up close and personal documentary I viewed included on the DVD with director Richard Donner and all the stars and specialized crew, locations and everything was talked about with nothing left out; I have had to slight myself to make enough time till next I watch. You'll cheer without even being there, I promise!
B00005JN5X|4.0|While the script leaves something to be desired, The Brothers Grimm was a classic Terry Gilliam movie. It was visually stunning, a real feast for the eyes. It was quite enjoyable, if not fully developed, and the chemistry between Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as brothers was rather amusing. Not the best movie, but if you go with full knowledge that it isn't a masterpiece, you won't be disappointed.
B0000AMJED|5.0|I found this movie to be worth a lot of fun before it was a lot of fun, and that is because everyone in the movie got along so well. The leadership behind the movie shows through in a-typical ways lending a deafening mode to the good beating out the bad guys. You can't say that it is loud justice, because you would never hear it; but in never betraying sophistication, it makes a towering intellectual victory. All of the scenes and stunts are absolutely devouring and the attention paid to the plot by the actors is at the very least a true marvel. And everything else is what happens when everything I just said, happens!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Yes, I liked _Farhenheit 9/11_, but that is not my point here. Rather, in respone to previous reviewers who stated that Moore is \\"un-American\\" and that he should be executed for \\"treason,\\" I would just like to say that one of the best ways to love your country is to care enough to criticize it when you think it is doing something wrong or being governed badly.  Dissent is an act of courage and responsible citizenship, not treason.  Furthermore, the exercise of our constitutional right to free speech is one of the most American activities a person can engage in. The accusation of \\"treason\\" by some of these reviewers reminds me of events during WWI, when many American citizens were held as prisoners of conscience, sentenced to years in prison because they dared to speak out against the war.  Eugene V. Debs was one such prisoner, sentenced to 10 years in  federal prison for giving a speech in which he criticized U.S. involvement in WWI. You can read this Canton, Ohio speech for yourself in _Eugene V. Debs Speaks_ by Jean Y. Tussey if you would like to know what the government was labeling sedition at that time. The Sedition Act prohibited any \\"profane or abusive language\\" against the United States government. No matter whether you're a liberal or a conservative, let's agree that we should not return to those days when in this supposedly free country a person could be imprisoned for stating his beliefs. That, my friends, was something truly un-American.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|Like Jackal there, I enjoyed Silent Force much more than Mother earth... though, i must admit, something strange happened to me... After I got my Silent force copy I was again in a \\"WT-mood\\" and grabbed my mother earth copy... I think it helped me understand more the concept and music.  I miss a little the growling but I know the tendency now is leaving that behind, and with Shannon sweet-lovely-emotive voice you dont have anything more to ask for.<br /><br />You can see the evolution from their previous cd's (enter and EP the dance) which were pretty good too!, I guess you can't blame them for evolve in a more \\"polite\\" way which has also been helpful for them to be in the spotlight in Europe and America.<br /><br />My personal favorite songs are:<br /><br />See Who I Am (great one to prepare you for whats coming)  Jillian (I'd Give My Heart) (One of the best songs in the CD)<br /><br />Stand My Ground (definately the best one)<br /><br />Aquarius (I simply love it!)
B0002OERI0|4.0|Good album - several great songs, but maybe not as consistent as previous CDs.
B00003CXCD|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time on TV, the show began at 1:30 in the mourning from sunday to monday and ended at 4:00 AM. I slept barely 3 1/2 hours before going to work, but it was worth it and I would do it again if I had to just because this movie is that good. Fortunately I won't have to do that again as that very monday after seeing it for the first time I ordered the DVD to watch it without TV ads. <br /> <br />This is classical cinema the way Hollywood used to make its movies: we have a great cast, a charming story, chemistry between Peck and Hepburn and one of the greatest endings ever made on a romantic comedy, all set in a beautiful city as Rome. <br /> <br />Hepburn is a princess who is sick and tired of his life style. She wants freedom, freedom to talk to normal people, to walk on the streets, to choose her haircut, freedom to live at least a few moments as she wants to (by the way, the mexican translation of the movie title is something like \\"The Princess that wanted to live life\\", wich summarize pretty much what this story is about). <br /> <br />She escapes from his country's embassy after she takes some medication to help her sleep and on the street she is found sleeping by Gregory Peck, who takes care of her. Peck is a journalist and when he sees on the newspaper the picture of the princess (who is supposed to be sick, according to the embassy) he will try to get an exclusive note on the princess during her juorney trough Rome. <br /> <br />We all know what's going to happen between them as this movie doesn't have the most innovative plot in history. What makes this a classic is the chemistry between Peck and Hepburn, the jokes (some of them silly) and the sense of joy seen on Hepburn as she discovers Rome, which makes more beliavable her character (she won the Oscar for that role). <br /> <br />As some user noted before, this movie has a little plot twist at the end. This is a coda, a perfect finale. We see a dream come true, but at the end all the characters wake up from their dreams and come back to reality. That's what sets Roman Holiday appart from other cinderella-like stories. I have seen better movies, but none of them is as enjoyable as Roman Holiday. Go and see it today if you haven't, and if you have then see it again every time you want to remember why do you love cinema. <br /> <br />Enjoy!!!!!!
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay is one of the most innovative best sounding groups of all time. This CD makes me laugh, cry and think about life. I can definitely play it front ot back. It's one of their best collections to date.
0743454537|3.0|I admit that this story is compelling. It's a little more \\"best-sellerish\\" than my typical reading material, but I picked it up on a whim and then spent so much time reading it in the bookstore that I finally gave in and bought the darn thing.  <br /> <br />The writing is serviceable, but not masterful. My primary complaint in this regard is that Picoult told the story from too many different viewpoints (7, by my count), and the voice of each character was so similar that I often had to check the name at the beginning of the chapter to determine which character was speaking. Even Jesse's voice (perhaps the most recognizable in the bunch) was distinguished primarily by a peppering with the occasional curseword (which was completely appropriate to his character; I have no idea why it would have irritated anyone. Troubled eighteen-year-old boys don't have the same vocabularies as nuns. Had Jesse's character never cursed, it would have been astoundingly unrealistic.) Interestingly, I did find her male characters a bit more enjoyable to read than the females. <br /> <br />I thought there were credibility issues throughout. Sure, Anna's history may have made her wiser than the average thirteen-year- old, but there were multiple instances where I simply didn't buy her precocious voice as that of a rather socially isolated adolescent girl (Why, for instance, would she think of someone's name as sounding like \\"an overpriced bar drink\\"?? This child has clearly never been in a bar and would have no frame of reference for such a thought. This occurred within the first few pages of the book, and throughout the book, this type of flaw in the narration caused a troubling break in my suspension of disbelief.) <br /> <br />Also, I had trouble with the lawyer's \\"secret.\\" It didn't seem possible that he could have hidden it for so long. Wouldn't he have had to explain to someone, somewhere, why he needed to bring a service dog into the courtroom when he was clearly not blind or hearing impaired? Because I am familiar with this type of service dog, I knew immediately what his disability was. I found it hard to believe that nobody he'd encountered in the past fifteen years had similar knowledge. If Julia had really been curious about it, why didn't she just go online and google \\"service dogs\\"??? Silly. I liked the implications of Campbell's disability, but this aspect of the character and his storyline could have been made a little more believable with a little more effort on the author's part, I thought. <br /> <br />As others have mentioned, Sara's disregard for her other children is a little hard to swallow, though I didn't find it completely unbelievable given the circumstances. I did think that the psychology behind this dynamic could have been more fully illuminated. Was there, for instance, some reason that she identified with Kate more strongly than with her other children? <br /> <br />I had trouble with the resolution of the major plot, as well as that of the subplot between Julia and Campbell. The resolution of the latter seemed far too pat--like something that belonged in a romance novel, not a novel that purports to deal with supremely messy issues of life, death and medical ethics.   <br />Like other reviewers here, I did feel that the unexpected ending was a bit of a cop-out. I'd rather have seen the consequences of a more difficult decision by Anna and the others. This ending felt manipulative....ultimately, it just didn't ring true. I suddenly felt the author's hand manipulating her story, rather than a natural resolution to each of the characters' stories as they had unfolded thus far. Again, the break in suspension of disbelief. Also (and here I risk giving away a little too much), I felt the author's choice regarding the driver of the vehicle that plays a role in the plot twist was poor. It should have been Sara, I think.  <br /> <br />Despite the flaws that marred the flow of the story and its resolution, this was still an engrossing and highly readable book...it engaged me emotionally and of course led me to ponder some of the ethical issues presented in the work. I would recommend it, especially to young women, who might be more tolerant of the heavy doses of melodrama.  <br />
B0002858YS|3.0|I am not a very big fan of this kind of music and purchased it so I could listen to their songs that made it to singles. Everything else was just OK. I could be wrong though since this isn't my typical genre.

Just one more thing it's never a good thing when women betray women, After you see the movie's ending you'll understand what I mean.

0312323859|5.0|I just finished reading Something Borrowed and was not sure how I was going to be able to like a book focusing on Darcy, but I was impressed with the author's ability to make the reader empathetic to the narrator. Just like with Something borrowed, I was truly captivated with this book. Can't wait for her next book!
B0009QTS1M|2.0|For months I've anticipated this new, extended version of Gladiator. During the wait, I upgraded my entertainment system to one that supports DTS 5.1. I've been thrilled to finally hear the superb DTS tracks on films such as \\"Master and Commander\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  <br /> <br />But now upon hearing that this \\"new\\" version is without the DTS track, I regret to say that I will NOT be purchasing it... ever. Instead, I went straight to Amazon and ordered a used copy of the signature version with DTS (which I did not have yet).   <br /> <br />Am I going to miss the 17 minutes of added footage? Sure. But I'm certain I'll catch them when viewing the DVD that someone ELSE has purchased. They can have their 17 extra minutes (with substandard sound) and I'll have the rest of the movie in DTS.
B0009WFF7M|4.0|Firstly be warned - This is a dualdisc and not a DVD audio....<br /><br />One side is the album in standard CD stereo, the other side is Dolby digital 5.1 dvd audio - and PCM stereo - without any significant special features ( no videos or lyrics...)  The 5.1 surround is very good and adds a pleasant dimensionality to the performance, without being gimmicky.  Only 4 stars as the disc is not 'fully loaded' with extras, which after all is the main point of the dvd side.
B00005JKNF|5.0|brilliant, smart, sexy.  this movie makes me laugh out loud no matter how many times i've seen it.  maggie smith is fabulous.
1400049628|5.0|While classed as \\"humor,\\" this book takes itself very seriously.  It adopts its own mythos to explain the possibility and periodic appearance of zombies and covers all manner of survival rules--from what kind of supplies to stockpile, where to hole up, what weapons work best against the shambling masses.  For the most part, I found it fascinating.  The least appeal for me was in the history of zombie attacks presented at the end.  My main pleasure was in considering Brooks' theories on why schools make good shelters and malls do not (not for the same reason Romero suggests) or why this weapon is superior to that one.  A lot of thought went into this, and reading it really fired my imagination.  If you enjoy \\"what if\\" scenarios, then you might enjoy this one, too--but don't come to it expecting slapstick just because it's in the humor section.  I'm easily amused, but only once or twice did this book inspire me to laugh out loud.  I am recommending it to my friends, but not without some caveats.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I was one of the lucky few who caught this amazing miniseries on the BBC America channel and I immediately fell in love. A million and a half times better than most of the regular movies out there, I went out and bought the book because of how much I loved this movie. Every single person in this miniseries is cast perfectly. When books become movies, there are always one or two casting choices you disagree with. That is not the case here. Seriously, they could not have possibly done a better job. I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE!!! Everyone should buy this!
0060723513|5.0|This book is a must-read for everyone. This beautiful novel tells the story of Marlow Morgan's experience in the Australian Outback with her Aboriginal soul mate. It is an incredible story and is full of wisdom, for all ages. Even if you do not believe the story is true, it still holds many powerful messages.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|As a screenwriter, I thought the story was well done... the acting superb... and the direction and cinematography wonderful.  I absolutely loved Gerard Butler in the lead role.  Would love to see some more of him in other films!  Terrific movie.  I highly recommend.
B00000DATR|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Mike Oldfield. Granted, the man is a genius, but his stuff just doesn't resonate with me.  <br />This, however, is an exception. Everything he has done well on the other albums, together, just even better. From the first tones this album is mesmerizing, each track an essential part of the journey. There's something of every musical style. Trance, rock, ambient, folk... everybody could like this. <br />Also, the last track is one of the most climactic I have ever heard. Truly majestetic.

B00006AFUR|4.0|I was visiting in California this summer and heard them all over the radio so when I got home to Florida I purchased this CD to listen to the whole things and not just a couple songs. I must say I was not disappointed at all. The band is great, their editing and producing sounds superb. The only complaint I have is although the songs individually are really good the total theme of them about space and the universe is a little annoying, but dont let that deter one from buying this CD. If you are looking for a for a solid, up and coming Rock Band with a new edge, Buy It.
0975991477|4.0|Dr. Lipton writes a great book, but he spends way too much time explaining, and explaining, and explaining.  It is a shame that he felt the need to write on such a lower level.  The information is well worth reading.  You won't have any trouble with too much technical data.
1400032717|5.0|When this book first came out, I dismissed it as a gimmicky work that would never stand the test of time.  After weeks and weeks on the best seller lists, however, I finally decided to see what was making this little red title fly off the shelves.  The book requires you to get past the somewhat implausible concept of a teenage autistic narrator named Christopher who writes with the simple precision of Hemingway.  Once you swallow the concept (and you will), this odd narrator leads you through a moving detective story in which he uncovers some troubling family secrets while investigating the mysterious death of his neighbor's dog.  This same story, told by an ordinary narrator, would be unremarkable.  But using his love of math as a way of parsing through life's ambiguities and anchoring himself in a chaotic world, Christopher alternately wows you with his insights into how mathematical laws explain complex subjects like human evolution and then breaks your heart with his inability to complete everyday tasks like boarding a train.  In the end, though, you may begin to question who is more balanced, the multitudes who carry on their lives without questioning what it's all about or this young autistic man who takes nothing for granted and lives true to his own logic-based code.<br /><br />-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\"
B000286S8S|3.0|I love Van Halen.  They rocked in concert.  I could be happier with this cd though.  The three new tracks do not belong here.  New releases are not greatest hits.  The three live tracks don't belong here either.  Aren't they on Right Here, Right Now?  Those should have been put on a \\"bonus\\" disc or as free downloads on their website.  Songs that could have gone in their place are \\"Don't Tell Me\\" from Balance, \\"little Guitars\\" & \\"Where Have All The Goods Times Gone\\" from Diver Down, \\"Little Dreamer\\" & \\"Ice Cream Man\\" from Van Halen, \\"Women In Love\\" from Van Halen II, \\"Drop Dead Legs\\" from 1984 or even \\"Humans Being\\" from their first \\"Best Of\\" cd.  And what about Van Halen III?  Perhaps they could have thrown Gary a bone with \\"Fire In The Hole\\" or a live version of some hit.   <br /> <br />Also, as a general gripe, it aggrivates me when bands put out multiple \\"best of/greatest hits\\" albums that duplicate in whole or in part a previous \\"best of/greatest hits\\" album.  This and the Best Of Van Halen Vol.  I should have been organized into two separate releases.  As is, it just seems like they are trying to suck up more of our money.  I've given them enough of mine.  Since I have all the other albums I'll just rip & burn my own greatest hits cd.  I feel an urge to give this one or two stars but this cd gets three stars just for the simple fact that it is Van Halen and it is a good compilation.
B00009UW0N|2.0|..everything else about this low budget \\"classic\\" is atrocious. Donald Pleasence, a seasoned \\"B\\" actor, provides the only decent acting in this movie. He filmed all his scenes in 5 days, and it really shows as he seems rushed and in it just for the paycheck. I first saw this movie at age 15, and even though I was only a casual film  buff, I did not find it scary at all and I thought the acting and the script were extremely bad. There were others before Halloween, but, this is THE film that started the alarming trend that all teenagers must be completely braindead if cast in a horror film. They must possess no acting skills, and most importantly, they must be silly beyond redemption. This entire cast fits the bill nicely, and the dialog in this movie goes beyond stupidity. How can anyone be scared if their intelligence is constantly insulted ? There are several highly suspenseful scenes in this movie that are destroyed because the director didn't know when to say enough is enough. He would drag these scenes on and on until they lost any momentum they built up. Maybe this movie is supposed to be light, scary fun but how can it be so if there is absolutely no logic to the plot, it's swamped in bad acting and dialog, and the director is clueless when it comes to editing. Many claim that it's a superior film  in contrast of it's low budget, but people, almost a half million dollars was spent on this silly movie, and this was in 1978 .....which meant that it actually had a substantial budget. I will never understand how so many claim this to be a scary or even an enjoyable film. I liked the killer and the music, but, there's simply too many failures and faults to consider this a true classic or even a good horror movie.
B000852GIQ|5.0|Check out this CD if you like the music from the movie Amelie. Yann Tiersen did another create job here, you wouldn't want the the wonderful music stop once you play it.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|I don't have any fresh insight to this album, i wasn't even born when it was released so i can't tell you how it's release changed rock music in the 70's, i can't really tell you how or why all of the bands that've tried to rip off \\"fun house\\" and The Stooges in general over the years have failed because they've always missed out the most crucial part : the rhythm (well, that and not having a genius guitarist like Ron Asheton) and i can't tell you anything about this you don't already know or that Lester Bangs didn't say 1000 x better than i ever could in his original review when it came out.<br /><br />All i can tell you is THANK GOD the greatest rock album of all time and the greatest of all time, period, has finally gotten the reissue treatment it's deserved for so long and, lemme tell ya, ir's been worth the wait. The old cd version of this was quiet, sounded a tad thin and you almost had to struggle to hear the bass at times but here it sounds 3d, dense and, franky, colossal.<br /><br />The second disc contains the two amazing songs from the \\"fun house\\" that didn't make it as well as the outtake highlights of that ridiculous super-limited 7 hour \\"fun house\\" boxset thing. I tip my hat to Rhino for putting all this on a second disc thus giving us value for money and not cluttering up the actual album itself as lots of these remastered reissues do.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I dont know why...I always get a little nervous before I listen to a new album from any of my favorite artists. It is a bad habit I need to work on. Robert is my favorite artist for his diversity, personality and his words. Dreamland was a labor of love, tipping his hat to his various influences. All of his albums have their own distinct personality and direction. Mighty Rearranger speaks on many different levels. This is an album that speaks of the times, political games, the duality of religious belief thru the regions in the world and makes the listener ask questions. One distinct difference is Robert lets you get to know Robert, how he feels about what is going on in this world right now, how he feels about his own life, and how the people that were in his life, no longer in this world still affect him.<br /><br />In the past, Robert was not so willing to delve into waters he has swam before, he was bent on creating a new standard for himself with every album he recorded. Mighty Rearranger is an album that shows he is allowing himself to look back and embrace the good parts of the past and not ignore. \\"Let the Four Winds Blow\\" is a song that personifies that message. He wants to acknowledge them, take them with him, but set them free \\"Now, I'm back on the hill. Yes, youre gone, but youre with me still\\". \\"Dancing in Heaven\\" is a catchy, acoustic number. If Led Zeppelin III had a hidden track, this would be it. \\"Freedom Fries\\" and \\"Another Tribe\\" are about what has been going on now after 9/11, the war in Iraq and makes you think. \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" is a glimpse into how Robert sees himself if he does not keep it real for himself. \\"The Enchanter\\" is a journey back to Kashmir-Justin Adams is a great guitarist with Eastern chops with rockabilly. I almost dare to compare him to Jimmy, but I couldnt...different flavors, equally delicious. \\"All the Kings Horses\\" is another acoustic, very pretty song that is said to be about a soldier and war, however it seems to me to be about falling in love again \\"I'll weave a circle round the sun, throw down my arms and give my all. I'll be your soldier of love\\".<br /><br />Robert is one of the few that \\"get it\\". He dosent have to sell anything, just his message, being himself is the delivery.<br /><br />Thank you for another great album, Robert.be about falling in love again \\"I'll weave a circle round the sun, throw down my arms and give my all. I'll be your soldier of love\\".  <br /> <br />Robert is one of the few that \\"get it\\".

B000002U82|5.0|...to have with me on a deserted island, Pink Floyd's THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON would be it!  No question! <br /> <br />The music and history of this legendary album have spoken for itself for the last 32 years.  From it's opening heartbeat of \\"Breathe\\" right through the grand finale of \\"Eclipse\\", the listener is transported through an odyssey of music.  Particularly noteable are the instrumentals \\"On The Run\\" and \\"Any Colour You Like\\", which can only be described as the best psychedelic journey you'll ever take without the drugs (although I hear they've been know to help). <br /> <br />As Pink Floyd makes the news once again with their brief reunion for the Live 8 concerts, fans can only hope that was not just a one-time gig. <br /> <br />By the way, in case you care, here are the other 9 CDs I would have with me on that island: <br /> <br />- PINK FLOYD - THE WALL <br />- RUSH - MOVING PICTURES <br />- LED ZEPPELIN IV <br />- YES - CLOSE TO THE EDGE <br />- STEELY DAN - AJA <br />- THE WHO - WHO'S NEXT <br />- JOURNEY - ESCAPE <br />- ASIA  <br />- SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER soundtrack <br />(Hey, gimme a break!  I have very strong memories of that  period).

0807126063|5.0|Arguably the best dialogue of any book ever written in the United States.  Every single voice is distinct.  Try doing that sometime in your own writing.  Try differentiating your characters by voice.  It's damn near impossible.  Word has it that Toole was a mimic with a spot-on ability to imitate dozens of New Orleans characters, and he'd entertain his friends with his impressions into the wee hours of the morning.
0596007124|5.0|I have a hard time getting a handle on some patterns.  This book really does give the reader some real life examples!  My favorite book of the year!
B00006EXL5|5.0|Sorry to Kramer from Iowa, but if you don't like the CD, keep it to yourself and keep yourself from upsetting the rest of the world, because we are cool, MCR is cool, and you are a loser if you don't love these guys.  The first song I heard was on my roommates PC, \\"Thank You for the Venom\\", track 7 on \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" and I instantly knew that I had a favorite band...  Now, I can't stop thinking about the band, I feel that every song they have (whether the lyrics apply or not) <br />has a sound that fits every mood you could feel.  And for the music lover like me, they are all you ever need.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney was once hailed as the Queen of Pop with her radio friendly chart releases and wholesome image.  Yet now she has reached the ripe age of 23 Britney has really destroyed her music career and this album is just one example of her desperate attempts to be accepted as a mature and independent woman/singer.  First of all Britney's new image is one of the main reasons for her failing career.  She sold zillions of records based on the fact that she oozed sex appeal, yet at the same time she claimed to be pure and virginal.  Just listen to the lyrics on tracks like 'Sometimes' and you will remember Britney as the girl-next-door with a shy and innocent outlook on relationships.  She had superstar looks with her healthy curves that shattered the misconception that women in Hollywood had to be dangerously thin if they wanted to be known as attractive and wanted.  Her one strength was her dancing ability and her steaming hot videos and this compensated for her weak voice.  Yet Britney has ruined her physique and this was her best feature as an artist, because the majority of fans chose to look beyond her hopeless singing efforts .  She smokes drinks and sleeps around and is concerned with impending motherhood, so it looks as if the Britney that set the music world on fire with her every move is no longer the icon she once claimed to be.    This album shows Britney moving in the direction of dance music.  The bubblegum pop tracks she once released are no longer present on this album and it would be expected that Britney would take the opportunity to evolve into an entertainer with a little substance.  Her producers on this LP-who just happen to be some of the best in the recording industry (R Kelly) (P Diddy) (Moby) work overtime to conceal her limited vocal range and the infectious production work, which serves the purpose of distracting our attention away from the actual singing, highlights her inability to hold a note and project her voice in the tracks.  The openingtrack is a disater and this sets the tone for the rest of the album.  Madonna makes a cameo appearance but the meaningless lyrics and forgetable beat makes this one song that has no appeal and despite the common expectation that two of the most overrated stars could produce a record that is fairly exciting, this track disappoints.  The next five or more tracks all blur together and I have listened to the album six times I can't even recite the lyrics or hum the tune.  They talk about sex and sex and more sex and getting intoxicated which ironically are the issues that Britney is best known for in the present climate.  Toxic is the only track that is polished and produced ready for an assault on the music charts.  This is a highlight of her career and it does prove that with a little help from a good songwriter and producer Britney can create a unique and original sound.  The song Everytime could be quite an emotional record.  The beat is soft and the sound is easy to listen to which is in contrast to the background noise on the other tracks that has no structure and is a repetitve and mediocre mix of techno sounds.  But her voice is not strong enough to capture emotion.  In fact the whole album is a selection of whispers and panting.  Britney cannot sing and she is proving it with this album.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|It's all incredible. Period.The one drawback is having the great yet overplayed perrenial frat party faves (LOUIE LOUIE, WOOLY BULLY) crammed in with the lesser known/unknown tunes. it may have been better had Rhino organized these seperately, as a \\"bonus disc.\\"...  The second volume digs even deeper, with wondrous results.
0767812166|5.0|Starman has it all it has a great cast leading by the talented Jeff Bridges and the wonderful Karen Allan!!!! The story is about a man that is a alien and he is off course and he ends up falling madly in love with Karen!!!!!!!! John Carpenter does a great job of directing this movie and if you are like me and you are a die hard romantic freak then you need to watch this movie!!!!!!
B0009VRHLK|1.0|Looking at the box, I thought \\"Hey, an arty movie about bikes and sex, something apart from cheezy crapola like Torque and Biker Boyz (sic.)\\" <br /> <br />I felt terrible for making my wife watch the entire thing, b/c I didn't take her suggestion to just fast forward to see if anything interesting finally happened. If I had done that, I would have watched the following: <br /> <br />1) Opening race scene <br />2) Blasting out on the Bonneville Salt Flats <br />3) Running the bike on the dyno in CA <br />3) Blasting a load into Chloe <br /> <br />So much potential... Overall, I think I'd have used my time better renting a copy of \\"On Any Sunday\\" and some XXX-oral fetish  flick.
0763624292|3.0|THere are so many songs on this CD.  MY son only listens to the 1st one.  As soon as its over, he wants to hear it again. He's 3 and not yet interested in the other ones.
6304698690|5.0|Best filmed version of this gentle tale.    Best actors, direction and photography. <br />True to the story and with it's own added charm.
0689815816|5.0|I grew up with this song, and I was so happy to find a book so that I can share it with my son.  He is 3 and LOVES it.  He is always humming it, and loves the book. I also got the CD, and he loves to read along with it.
B000002G87|5.0|I truly believe this is Eric Clapton's greatest CD. It has the perfect balance of Blues and Rock.  <br /> <br />The First Eric Clapton CD I ever bought was Timepieces. It was on sale at Wal*Mart and I had heard good things about Clapton. On that CD was the song Layla. It was one of the first Clapton songs I fell in love with. So a few CD's later, I ended up purchasing the Layla CD. I had never heard any of the songs on there before except for Layla. And When I bought it, I didn't know if it was gonna be worth it.  <br />It was worth it!!! Every song on it is great! You see as I said earlier it's a good balance of rock and blues, and thats the part of Clapton that I like. I own quite a few of his CD's but out all of them.. this one is my fav. <br />The guitar parts are incredible...  <br />\\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" is fantastic...  <br />\\"Nobody Loves You When Your Down and Out\\" is more of a blues song.. btu I still really love it.. <br />\\"Little Wing\\" is a great tribute to Jimi... <br />and of course... there's always Layla  :)
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This movie is very cute, if a little impractical.  It hits all the points of struggle in different types of relationships.  And, if only we could have Hugh Grant in tennis whites all the time :-)  Stellar cast all the way around.  Can watch over & over and still laugh and cry.
0446691437|5.0|If you can't handle looking in the mirror and taking responsibility for the past as well as the future don't buy this book.  However, if you are stuck in your career or can't seem to attain a goal and can't figure out why (even though you know), this is a good place to start.  This book is very different from other self-help books; no drivel, no poor me exercises, no blame my parents game, nothing like that! Just get yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again. You don't get second chances when you are dead. Good news, if you are reading this passage you're alive! Try again. I highly recommend this book.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this story of love lost & found again. Maybe it is due to the the ages of the former lovers as they are not the starry-eyed people they once were.  As the film begins, seven years have passed since their young romance was ripped apart by Amanda's family.  Each has secretly carried this aching, painful, longing ever since.<br /><br />Will family opinion and personal pride again tear them apart, this time forever?  they know such an unexpected second chance will not come again.  Having gone on with their lives, can they continue without knowing what could have been?  Will they risk their hearts one more time?  Theirs is an adult romance.  The rose-colored glasses are off and they appreciate even more the person they knew.<br /><br />Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root were talented stage veterans when they moved to the world of film.  Their insinct for timing and body language is wonderful to watch.  They are perfectly matched and this viewer would dearly love to see them together in more films.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is excellent. It's Burton's dark vision, mixed with song and humor. It's different than the 71 version and more faithful to Dahl's book. The best part is Depp, who gives an excellent performance. He's starting to become my favorite actor.
6305907145|5.0|Having never read the book, this film is a total delight. The subplots mentioned in other reviews brought a more serious flavor than some of Austin's characters such as Emma, great fun though she is.  I loved the character Francis O'Conor portrayed and found the storyline more developed than others have been.  Mansfield Park, Emma, Sense and Sensibility and most of Persuasion, with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, are most loved in my DVD library.  Though others are quite disappointed, this viewer found the film a complete delight from start to finish and eagerly plans to visit Mansfield Park again and again.
B0002858YS|1.0|Hi. We are The Killers. We've never had an original thought in our life. Congratulations on buying this giant turd we let loose out of our bowels onto your face. We take pride in the fact that you've probably heard this music a million times before in various forms over the past few decades. Don't let the fact that our lead singer doesn't know that singing like a monotone tone deaf retard isn't ironic anymore. All you need to know about us is that people trying too hard to be cool will fawn all over you when you say you listen to us.  <br /> <br />Anyone with taste or anyone who has ever listened to a minute of music in their life should urinate on this like a cat. There isn't much that is worse than this. If I had to listen to The Killers or listen to a fire alarm going off 2 inches from my ear,  I'd gladly choose the alarm.  <br /> <br />\\"Somebody Told Me\\" is a damn war crime if I've ever seen one. Some good old generic nu-rock, with guest star Corky from Facts of Life hamming it up about his boyfriend he had last year. I'm glad actors with Down Syndrome are being accepted in rock. The results just don't work. As for the rest of the album, it's pretty much the same variations, with more Corky. Apparently they didn't let the lead singer on this CD at all. I guess Corky is a bigger market draw.  <br /> <br />So in closing, you buying this CD is completely dependent on how strongly you feel about supporting retarded ex-child actors.
B0000CAXID|4.0|After enjoying the 2005 model of Dave Grohl's band so much, I thought I'd go back and listen again to his debut CD with Foo.  It holds up really well after ten years, as our first chance to hear that winning blend of melodicism with punk power.  Some of the slower tunes slightly preview the acoustic disc of the 2005 Foo album In Your Honor, especially \\"Big Me.\\"  In other places, as on \\"Weenie Beenie,\\" Grohl rocks out harder than anything this side of Probot.  The best songs of all are the ones with a bit of both worlds - slower verse and harder chorus - cuts such as \\"For All the Cows.\\"  Very tasty!  In all, this self-titled First Foo was (and remains) a worthy effort.
0783240236|5.0|As an adult you will enjoy this for what it is, a horror film with no real villian.  But this film will keep the kids up at night.    Hitchcock goes back to Daphne du Maurier for a third time (Jamacia Inn and Rebecca).  This was one of his best all out horror films (Only Psycho was better).     Most people know the story of the birds taking over a small coastal town in Northern California.  But Hitchcock sets a love story in the middle of it.    The film stars Rod Taylor and newcomer Tippi Hedren.  And features future stars Suzanne Plushette (Bob Newhart Show), a young Veronica Cartwright (Invasion of the Body Snatchers) and Jessica Tandy (Oscar winner for Driving Miss Daisy) as Rod Taylor's mother!    DVD EXTRAS:     About the Birds - 1 hour 19 minute documentary about the making of the film.  This is a comprehensive documentary about the making of the film with interviews his daughter Patricia, production designer Robert Boyle, writer Evan Hunter, F/X technicians Bill Taylor and Syd Dutton, makeup artist Howard Smit, storyboard artist Harold Michelson, stars Tippi Hedren, Rod Taylor and Veronica Cartwright and film historians Peter Bogdonvich and Robin Wood.   This may sound long but it is a wonderful look not only into the film but Hitchcock.    Deleted Scene - This is a scene that was shot but did not survive.  It contains stills and the script.     Original Ending - This was the original ending for the film.  It contains storyboards and the script    Storyboard Sequence - Hitchcock had the entire film in story board before it started filming.  This is 30 storyboards that show the attack on Marion at the end with the actual film still.    Tippi Hedren's Screen Test - This is her original screen test with Martin Balsam and background voice of Hitchcock.  It runs just under 10 minutes.  Screen tests are seldom seen and so this is fun to see.    \\"The Birds\\" is coming - 1 minute newsreel promoting The Birds and Tippi Hedren    Suspense Story - 2 minute newsreel on Hitchcock's appearance at the National Press Club.    Production Photos - 30 publicity photos    Production Notes - Notes about the film from Hitchcock    Cast and Filmmakers - Bios on Tippi, Rod, Suzanne Plushette, Jessica Tandy and Hitchcock
B00005JN5X|1.0|Saw this yesterday, didn't expect anything and that's pretty much what I got.  Some of the special effects were cool, the storyline was very weak to say the least, I can appreciate the intertwining of the classic fairy tales however the gags pretty much made you go hugh? through the whole flick.  Matt Damon should stick to his Bourne parts and stay away from this kinda film. I think Ledger was okay, maybe pairing hime with Matthew Mcconahuy would have been a better cast.  Don't waste your money, wait til it shows on TV or rent the DVD to say the least, definately not a movie for kids either, then again some of Grimm's tales are pretty Grim as well.  I would have much rather seen this be a Tim Burton thing, if he would have been involved would had been kinda like Sleepy Hollow!  Oh well, nice try Guys!
0060245867|5.0|After seeing this story in a Blues Clues Episode my 3 year old was very curious, and so was I. It is a delightful tale with cause and effect being demonstrated to full effect. The pictures are delightful and engage his curiosity and the words are perfectly simple.  <br />A delightful book for 2 to 5 year olds to show what happens when you do indeed give a mouse a cookie.
B00003CY5J|4.0|While I'm not going to tout THE SCORE as an Oscar-worthy masterpiece, it is certainly one of the best \\"heist\\" films that I have seen in a long time.  THE SCORE does everything right: it allows its incredibly talented acting performances to become the central focus of the movie and not the high-tech gadgetry that are the staple of cheaper thrillers.  To be sure, THE SCORE is not without technology, but what makes this film \\"pop\\" is the fact that we are drawn into the plot by De Niro, Brando, and the absolutely fantastic performance of Norton.  As in PRIMAL FEAR, Norton plays a split-role, doubling as both an overeager thief and a mentally-challenged night janitor (a role he adopts in order to gain access to the high-security facility).  His performance is, as always, very impressive and certainly above-par for \\"heist\\" films.<br /><br />While some have complained of the slow pacing, I did not find it slow at all.  In fact, I enjoyed the slow build-up.  The first time you watch this movie, you will be wondering to yourself: \\"How on earth are they going to get into that impenetrable safe?\\"  It will keep you guessing right up until the very end.  And just when you think you have a grip on the entire plot, it will twist on you.  I love it when films do that to you and THE SCORE does it in spades.  And the fact that the director has the patience to let the film build without going for cheap-thrills is a testament to his ability.<br /><br />Once again, I'm not arguing that THE SCORE is the best movie I've seen lately.  But it is very much an entertainig thriller that is worth a look.  You will enjoy the action, the effects, and all of the usual things one finds in a \\"heist\\" film.  But you will also be surprised by the good acting.  I highly recommend it.
0671015206|2.0|The best way to get rich is to write a book on the best way to get rich. <br /> <br />Education is a poor investment, with little return. Buying a book is an investment in education, one with little or no return. Thus buying a book is a poor investment. Thus, the authors are calling you, the reader, gullible for buying their book in the first place, contrary to the advice in the book. <br /> <br />Furthermore there is a stark difference of contrast between earning 150k dollars a year and living well below your means and earning 30k dollars a year and living well below your means. <br /> <br />This book is about two steps up from sales hype, and they're not very big steps.
0743243315|5.0|I thought this book was very original.  I really enjoyed how it was written from the point of view of the main character's interior life, which was very effective because at the beginning of the story, she didn't speak English.  We watch her grow and learn English as well as about herself and life.  <br /> <br />The contrast of her life to that of the sister who remained back home is revealing.  It is the life she would have had if she had not come to England.   <br /> <br />It is a story of culture clash as well as assimilation and is beautifully written.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Great action pack thriller. Good story line, plot and conclusion. This movie is funny, violent, dramatic, and drutal all at once. What other movie do you know is like that? I recommend you rent it first to see how good it is than buy it! I like how Oh Dae Su kicks all 18 of those gang bangers in the hotel scene just after he gets revenge for his wrongful imprisonment of 15 years.
B00005AQE8|5.0|First of all let me say this album is a classic. This is not really a review, i'm just responding to Mr. Scott Martin. judging from your review i can already tell you know nothing about Tupac. That is the only logical explanation to your ignorant review. i can care less if u like Tupac or not, i dont even care if you like his music. you dont have to, that is your business. but please respect the man. those comments u made were extremely ignorant. Since you dont know nothing about Pac, let me educate you. Tupac come from the Amaru family. the Amaru family were activist. they were Black panthers, freedom fighters and revolutionaries. i'm guessing you are white, cuz if you were black you wont make such ignorant comments. u know nothing of the black struggles in America. Tupac was born into that life. his mother was a panther, she had him in jail. they moved from brookllyn to baltimore which had the highest percentage of black on black crime. they moved to Cali where they were also living in poverty. this is where he was introduced to most of the things he talked about in his music. the gangstas, thugs, drug dealers, pimps and prostitutes. these are the things in which he grew up around, this is what he was born into. Tupac was the voice of his people. of course a lot of the things he talked about he actually didnt do, but these were things he grew up around. that is what it means to be an artist. to illustrate life, to paint a picture from your point of view. though he was the greatest ever to grace the mic with his soulful, passionate and musical poetry along with a powerful voice and a flawless presentation, he was much more than a rapper. he was a poet, a revolutionary and an excellent actor. one could very well say that Pac was a prophet of his generation. Keep in mind that he only lived 25 years and in such small time, look at all of the things in which he accomplished. there are too many to list. name another rapper that actually made a big effort to unite the Bloods and Crips and actually succeeded. Yes Tupac used to scream \\"Thug Life\\" all the time but do you know what it means? No it does not mean going out robbing, stealing or killing people. \\"Thug Life\\" simply epitomizes society as it exists today. It means \\"The Hate You Give Little Infants F***s Everyone.\\" all these rappers in which you claim Tupac \\"copied.\\" It is safe to say they have all borrowed from Pac as well. matter of fact the whole damn industry today tries to emulate Pac. Think about it, more than half of the artists out today would not exist if Pac was still alive. Do you think people like 50 cent, chingy, nelly, Ja Rule, B2K, B5 would exist if Pac was still alive? HELL NO! Even Jay-Z would still be an underground rapper if Pac hasnt already forced him into early retirement. u claim Pac was a \\"phoney.\\" O.K. lets look at the facts. Pac got respect from everybody, from Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Disciples to Quincy Jones and Russel Simmons. Would a \\"phoney\\" get such a broad range of respect? NO? it's safe to say that even your favorite rapper idolizes Pac and your kids will too.so stop your hating because you are speaking from pure ignorance. Pac was more than music. He represented the struggles, pain, joy, flaws, emotions, mis-treatment and avery other aspect of black life in America. before you start making such stupid and ignorant comments of the late great Legend, you should take some time to do your research and try to understand who he really was. Understand what he stood for, the society from which he came, why he did the things he did and said the things he said, why did he live the way he lived. try to understand all of these things. if you dont understand then please keep your mouth shut, because when you speak from pure ignorance as you have, you not disgrace and disrespect this great man, but you do the same to the black race. Tupac deserves to go down in history next to people like Thomas Jefferson. Just because he did not wear a fancy suite, stood on podiums and lie to you and then steal your tax money, does not mean he was not real. Pac is as real as it gets. but people like you cannot handle reality, so you prefer to be lied to. dont criticize Pac. every man has his flaws. Did you know Thomas Jefferson even though he said all men are created equal, was a slave owner. did you know he too forced himself onto his slaves and had babies by them and then try to cover it up. up to this day he has black relatives. Please get your information straight before you start making such ignorant comments. you dont have to like anything about Pac, but you will respect him. i am not asking respect. i demand it because i'm pretty sure you dont make such disrespectful comments about Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.
0375703764|5.0|I loved this book, everything about it. The author's personal writing style was in and of itself, absolutely exquisite. The characters he created were so deep, so realistic in their many facades. I found the footnotes did occasionally a bit tedious, most of them were irrevelent citations of nonexistent text. This, however didn't disturb me, it is quite easy to skip past one sentence on the bottom of the page. They served their purpose well, in any case. Even without reading them, and with knowing that they are nonexistent, they managed to add a feeling off authenticity which allowed the reader (or say, a reader with an imagintion) to delve deeper yet into the events, and feel the weight of them, if they were to occur. <br /> <br />The entire principle of the book was extraordinary. It was exactly that it WASN'T your typical horror novel that made it so horrific. I hadn't even thought of using the word horror novel in application to this novel, until i read it in one of the other reviews here. This book DID leave me sleepless, more than once, actually, but it differs so much from other horror novels, and has so much more depth and symbolism to offer, that it cannot be simply tossed into that catagory without another thought.  <br /> <br />It leaves a person with so much to think about afterwards. What does the houses symbolize? Is it ones own psychology? Is it the psychology of one of the characters? All of the characters? Or is the house simply a vicious void, or worse, not even vicious, just something without any care for anyone or anything which loses itself there? Something eternal and simply existant? Does it belong to Johnny or Will?
1878424319|5.0|The concept this book starts with would be hard to swallow for most I think, but it was familiar to me and something I had already accepted so it was right down my alley.  I practice these 4 agreements everyday of my life and it gives me safe passage out of the mundane, 3 dimensional hell I was living in before.  It gives directions to a power that can and does move people to another shore.  Call that power whatever you like, having the best concept of that power is pointless.  Being concious of that power is priceless.

0425098478|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Blanchards now esential business read which I have jsut been through for the second time.  To a certain extent the edge was taken off the messages within the book following my reading of Geoff Burchs \\"Resistance is Useless\\" and, more recently, \\"Way of the Dog\\" which are now setting the standard of the business book as well as being genuinely funny in their own right.  <br /> <br />I look forward to Blanchards future work and particularly see how he deals with the hot reads such as Sumo and of course, Burch's publications
B0009YA37W|5.0|I first bought this album after reading a review of upcoming artists that sound like New Order on [...] , so I went ahead and purchased the CD, because after all New Order is my favorite band of all time. Now that I bought the album I realize that some of the songs are similar to past New Order songs, but they also have a mind of their own. \\"Lights,\\" starts off the cd with a bang and this continues until \\"Camera.\\" As the next few songs slows down a bit, they then kick back with a bang when \\"Fingers in the Factories\\" is played, then followed by \\"Bullets\\". I would say this album is in the TOP 10 Albums that I've heard over the past 5 yrs.
0553275976|5.0|Bonfire of the Vanities is a long book and a good story by celebrated author Thomas Wolfe.  I read a review of the book below and am wondering it it contained too much information and might have spoiled the ending, because right now I'm only halfway through the book.  So far, the sense I get is that there are no good guys or bad guys, but there is right and wrong and each character spends time flirting with both sides.  Sherman McCoy is a man who has all the trappings of success but his little empire is threatening to crumble becasue of his mounting debt, his affairs, and oh ya, a little hit and run accident that he should have reported to the police but didn't.  McCoy, as a character, doesn't have many redeeming qualities.  However, as political and cultural forces slowly unite to turn against him, I find myself rooting for him to stand up for all that is bad in society:  the tabloid press, the Jesse Jackson/Al Sharpton types that don't really care about the truth and the district attorneys looking for politcal gain.<br /><br />Wolfe covers every aspect of this hit run, from its innocent beginnings to the outlandish policical case that it will turn into.  Now 2/3rds of the way book, it seems Wolfe holds none of the characters in too much regard.  Everyone from the victim, the accuser, the lawyers and the press are pandering to their weakest traits.  I think that's where the title of the book comes from.  What happens when you throw a bunch of people looking out only for themselves into one volitile situation.  You get this book.<br /><br />Having now finished the book, I see why it is considered a classic.  Wolfe tells a great story.  Sherman McCoy is a bad man, motivated by money and seduced by younger women.  But when he gets involved in the accident, he slowly begins to change.  He is almost forced to change because all the other people involved in his life are worse than he is.  Yet they aren't behaving badly.  Wolfe just portrays these people for who they are.  Kramer is the district attorney who seizes the case against McCoy as a way to make a better life for himself.  He does what anyone else in the situation would do.  Reverend Bacon is typical of the race mongering civil rights activistis who put themselves above those they supposedly serve.  Peter Fallow is a journalist who would be nuts to refuse to cover a story that is given to him.<br /><br />I recommend this book because it points what can happen when selfishness overtakes people's lives.  And it is an entertaining story that shows what happens when liberal politicians put their own success ahead of the truth.are.

B000000OF6|5.0|Queen is right up there, like ABBA.  Always a good listen.
B00008WJBU|4.0|Intacto is an interesting movie based on a very original and creative theme. It loosely based on the adage that states \\"there is limited luck in this world, you always get somebody else's share\\". The movie is about a bunch of people who are either full of luck or utterly luckless. The luckless hunt for the lucky ones, run wagers and attempt to get lucky themselves. The very idea of being able to collect luck is intriguing. <br />Samuel (Max von Sydow) is an old holocaust survivor who runs a high-end casino in the middle of nowhere. He has been extremely lucky all his life and plays a dangerous one bullet game. He hasn't lost in thirty years and all his challengers have died. Thomas Sanz (Leonardo Sbaraglia) is the lone survivor of a plane crash (and thus deemed lucky) who is approached by a luckless Federico (Eusebio Poncela) to run wagers. Federico  is deceitful and wants to steal some of Thomas's luck and Thomas wants to quickly multiply his aircraft-crash insurance compensation. Incidentally, Thomas had burgled a bank before the crash and a cop in the form of Sara (Monica Lopez) is in hot pursuit. Each character's life gets entwined while as they attempt to fulfill their motives. The story wavers and gets confusing at times, but that just adds to the  intriguing plot. Thomas eventually manages to run a wager with Samuel ... you'll have to watch the movie to know the winner. <br /> <br />Intacto is another good movie coming from Spain. Terrific performances by Leonardo Sbaraglia and Max von Sydow. The cinematography deserves high marks, it is successful in creating surreal landscapes. The wager games are very creative.
6304696558|5.0|\\"Private Benjamin\\" was one of the best comedies of the 80's as well as one of Goldie Hawn's greatest performances besides \\"Cactus Flower\\", \\"Sugarland Express\\", \\"Foul Play\\", \\"Overboard\\", and \\"The First Wives Club\\" all of the titles I just listed have been released in decent DVD editions! Sadly the \\"Private Benjamin\\" DVD only exsists in this sub-standard Pan and Scan version! Plus the sound and picture quality is very poor! This title is way overdue for a Special Edition. Widescreen with some great special features like perhaps an audio commentary by Ms. Hawn and co-star Eileen Brennan! It would be fun to hear two old friends talk about the fun they had in their Oscar nominated roles. I've noticed that Goldie Hawn has yet to do an audio commentary on any of her films released on DVD. I wonder why? Anyway, I would love to see Warner Bros. give this title the treatment it deserves! I keep checking to see if a Special Edition is on the way but, no! Now I see that WB is releasing a comedy double feature DVD with this title and \\"Protocol\\" on one disc. Most likely WB will issue the same content on the double feature disc making a remastered Widescreen edition most un-likely! To bad! Such shabby treatment for a wonderful, beloved, box office hit that made alot of money for WB! I'm still hopeful that a better DVD edition will be released one day! Until then I'll continue to view this poor DVD edition!
0060922583|2.0|The overwhelming 5-star reviews here (as well as the low 'helpful' votes for any Amazon review that claims this book is a sham) leads me to believe that this book is being read by a lot of fans of paranormal and new age literature. <br /> <br />The problem with a \\"true believer\\" is that any evidence they see that counters their beliefs are immediatley rejected, without even examining the facts. Just because something can't be explined by science does not automatically mean that the paranormal explination is correct. Worse yet, any subscriber to the holographic universe (which is just a form of solipsism--that reality is a construct of the mind) will give you the standard smug \\"you are unenlighted\\" defense, as if that proves anything.  <br /> <br />Another reviewer put it best, and I think that he needs to be re-quoted because he makes a valid argument against this book being taken seriously: <br /> <br />\\"Talbot, an excellent writer, begins with the work of Karl Pribram, who does research into how the mind stores and retrieves memories. At some point, Pribram became aware of holograms, and found that the way the refracted laser light of hologram construction spreads out on its way to the film reminded him of the way a nerve impulse fans out at the end of a neuron. This, apparently, was enough to convinve Pribram (and Talbot) that not only is memory holographic, but so is the entirety of existence merely a holographic construct created by our brains... <br /> <br />Whether or not these things really happen, the whole book is based on an untested hypothesis based on an analogy drawn by one researcher. Does the analogy stand up when examined? How does the refracted light projected onto a film have anything to do with signals passing between physical neurons? Talbot never asks. For me, the analogy falls apart as soon as I take one step past noticing a correlation between the two events. This is more than Talbot (or, apparently, Pribram) ever does at any point in his book, so great is his enthusiasm.\\"
B00006GO9Q|3.0|The title track is the sole masterpiece. Also, please be aware that the titles are mistitled. What you've got here is an ABA format wherein the first track is reprised at the end. IN A SILENT WAY/IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME should actually be listed as IN A SILENT WAY/IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME/IN A SILENT WAY. Likewise, SHHH/PEACEFUL should be listed as SHHH/PEACEFUL/SHHH.    IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME is an incredibly lame dud-track that should've been omitted. SHHH/PEACEFUL/SHHH are perfectly enjoyable hack-tracks whose appeal is based on instrumental texture rather than compositional content. In other words, what you've got here is all timbre and not much content. Wayne Shorter's low-key eloquence is just as enjoyable as the electric pianos. Miles's trumpet, however, is too overbearing during some of his passages. He's too loud during those hackneyed high-register passages.
B00008PC2O|5.0|It is my opinion that no review is needed for this movie. If you have never seen this movie, just buy it.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|A simply perfect disk. Melodically created to satisfy to the but demanding lover of the good music. This disk is very similar to the Joshuas Tree or to the Rattle & Hum of U2 since mark a refreshing air in a time full with Pop Music. In Europe it has been an entire sensation the same as america for what I recommend this album to all that he/she wants to listen quality in letters, chords and arrangement of songs.
B0009K7QZ8|1.0|This show should have been canceled faster than My So Called Life. This has to be Foxes desparation for another 90210 or Melrose Place. It won't happen with this show. The storylines are rip right off a day time soap and acted out the worst. Can anybody answer this....Why do the parents look younger than the kids (except Adam Brody). Th OC should be pulled if for nothing else bad acting.
B0002S947K|5.0|If you have been waiting for someone that could breathe some  new life back into the singer/songwriter genre that was so prevelant in the 70's, here he is. Your Cat Stevens, Van Morrison, Neil Young, and Jackson Browne albums can all take a well deserved rest.  <br /> <br />All of the qualities that made those artists so great are here in these songs. Ray's soulful voice is filled with a passion that rivals both those of Cat Stevens and Van Morrison, yet it remains uniquely his own. His guitar playing is rich with melodic rythms that flesh out his thoughtful lyrics. There is also some very nice percussion work here peppered throughout most of the songs. <br /> <br />All in all this is a great album and a welcome entry into the genre of the singer/songwriter. Songs like \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Forever My Friend\\" will surely keep you interested and eager to know what will be next from this promising new artist.
B0009QTS1M|2.0|First, let me say I love this movie, and was looking forward to see the extended edition on DVD. What a disappointment this re-edited version of the film has been! While the new packaging and the extra documentary features are OK, this new edition doesn't really add anything of interest. Let me list some of the problems I found with the Extended Edition: <br /> <br />- First of all, no DTS soundtrack, which detracts a lot of value from any updated version of the film. The DTS track in the original DVD release was extraordinary, and it's difficult to understand why it is missing in this special edition. <br /> <br />- The new Dolby Digital mix included in this Extended Edition is problematic. The middle/center channel seems much lower than the rest, so the conversations are barely audible at times, yet fights and action scenes are very loud. None of these problems existed in the original DVD release: both DTS and Dolby mixes were properly balanced. Not in this version. I compared them side by side and couldn't understand why they had messed up the mix so badly in this super-duper edition. It's not worth your cash. <br /> <br />- The new edition of the film adds 17 minutes of footage that were left in the cutting floor. To tell you the truth, there's no compelling reason why those 17 minutes shouldn't remain in the cutting floor. These missing scenes really don't add much to the story, and hardly call for an \\"extended edition.\\" I was hoping they were going to include the much talked about fight of Maximus with a rhino. Forget it! The extra 17 minutes are mainly conversations building up the political conspiracy going on in Rome. <br /> <br />While some of the extra features are somewhat interesting, I found the Extended Edition to be a rip-off, and it hardly justifies the $29 they charge you for it. Stick to the original DVD, specially if you enjoy full-bodied DTS sound.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Ridley Scott made it possible. Despite four previous screen gems that deal with the warrior' s epic such as The Seven Samurais, Ben Hur, Henry V and Braveheart, the superb recreation of the Roman Coliseum, the handle of camera, the splendid cast, the arresting script, the glorious sequence of the initial battle in the forest and the final combat now belong to the history.<br /><br />Russell Crowe gave a towering acting and my sincere acknowledgment for Derek Jacobi `s performance curiously neglected by many spectators.<br /><br />A sublime tour de force that was deservedly awarded with the maximum honors.<br /><br />A new classic of the Cinema .
0679736646|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Ubik. It has elements of time travel, social commentary through the many forms Ubik takes, mystery and horror, all set in the near future (now past) of 1992 and the past of 1939.
0385338686|4.0|Sophie Kinsella, author of the \\"Shopaholic\\" books, really begins to come into her own with \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\".  Her previous novels have been very similar to each other: utterly fluffy and goodhearted, carried along by Kinsella's quick-paced storytelling; wonderfully clear and dramatic and easy-to-tread writing; and endearing but ever-blundering characters.  In \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\" she retains these strengths but builds a story with a bit more heft, and the effect is outstanding. <br /> <br />Samantha Sweeting, the protagonist, is a hardworking, high-flying lawyer.  She is on the verge of making partner when she learns she has committed a costly and humiliating mistake.  In a rash (and somewhat implausible) maneuver, she flees her office and the entire city of London and ends up knocking on the door of a house in the countryside, desperate for a glass of water and directions to the nearest hotel.  The residents give her a place to sleep for the night, but in her confusion she allows them to believe she is applying to be their live-in cook and housekeeper.  Much hilary ensues in the kitchen and bathrooms of the large home Samantha is now required to tend, but eventually - with the help of a hunky gardener - she learns to enjoy her new situation.  Eventually, though, the truth of her old life will come out. <br /> <br />There's a lot in this novel that's mediocre.  The main character, despite her law degree, is often a typical tizzy chick-lit narrator.  Her love interest is unsurprisingly good-looking and bland, and the other characters are two-dimensional at best.  The plot, although it's interesting, is predictable. <br /> <br />But there is more here.  Samantha's struggles are earnestly depicted, and her trials seem real.  Reading, as in the \\"Shopaholic\\" books, about a woman who can't stop buying designer shoes even when she knows she's overdrawn on her checking account can be fun, but it's unsympathetic.  But this story is about a woman who would never be overdrawn on her checking account, who has spent her entire life working toward the promise of partnership, and who finds herself suddenly at a loss.  The story of how she figures out who she is, or at least who she isn't, feels real, and - for all their delightful frivolity - that authenticity is what's missing from Kinsella's previous books.  If she can hone this serious side while preserving her light tone and quick tempo, her next book will be a masterpiece.
B00003CXCT|3.0|if i have never seen the original version, then whatever change george lucas made to the star wars trilogy would have gone unoticed by me.  i cannot say that, as is, the modified version of the star wars trilogy is not as good as the original, but they are just different.  would you be happy, if citizen kane and casablanca were updated with newly shot footages, then have the movie company telling you that the original versions are no longer available? <br /> <br />i give it a three, even though i can think of ways to call it a 5 or even an 1.  anyway, i am just glad that i have the perfect edition boxset of the original star wars trilogy on laser disc.  the only thing that i worry about now is that i may not be able to get a new laser disc player, the next time i need one.
B000002U9K|5.0|This CD is excellent. The songs are like stories that take you into them. West End Girls is of course the one with the most radio play in California (in the past), but the other songs are great as well. Listening is like going on an adventure with people you probably never would encounter on your own. I first bought this as an audio tape in the 80's and now, 15-20 years later it still feels good!
0553260111|5.0|I watched the movie long before I read the book. I loved the movie and the follow-up: Bourne Supremacy. Eventually I realised that the movies were based off books, which I unfortunately didn't know before. I was told that the books are better than the movies. I tried them, and I have t agree. The books are a whole lot better. I was surprised at the amount of detail that was either changed or left out of the movie. Overall, it's avery good read if you love thrillers, as I do.
6305754969|5.0|This is probably my all time favorite John Wayne movie.  It has it all Action, drama, comedy and even a little romance.  It is not just your standard shoot-em-up, but a great study of characters.  Great performances all around.  A very young James Caan is a green but able kid.  Christopher George is the supremely confident gunman hired by the evil landgrabber, Ed Asner.  Robert Mitchum is the drunken sheriff who must sober up for the fight of his life.  Of course, John Wayne as the hero who must save the day even though he suffers with a handicap of his own.  Great support from recognizable actors Paul Fix, Arthur Hunnicut, R. G. Armstrong,and Jim Davis.  While there is plenty of action in this movie, appreciate the interplay between the characters.  The dialogue comes relaxed and easy.  It is just some great entertainment.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0515127485|5.0|This unusual and original book is exceptionally well researched and skillfully written. The mystery and tension begin on the first page and never quite subside. The book provides a powerful and informed insight into the Russia of Stalin and of perestroika; the terror and paranoia of one is counterbalances by the decline and despair of the other. The story line is compelling, fanciful, and well sustained; unexpected twists and surprises abound. The story is essentially about Stalin's legacy; the perpetuation of totalitarian solutions as well as the lingering appeal of a strong cult of personality. Historical detail, contemporary reality, and fiction are seamlessly crafted into a very convincing and gripping story.<br /><br />Robert Harris is a graceful and intelligent writer, whether he is chilling us with scenes of Stalin's all-night dinner parties or with the gratuitous violence that pervades so much Russia in the 1990s. This book, in keeping with the others he has written, is meticulously research and professionally polished. The results of this effort are credible characters and powerfully evocative descriptions, all of which makes for excellent reading.<br /><br />For the second part of the book, Harris uses an epigram from Stalin: \\"If you are afraid of wolves, keep out of the woods.\\" This is a book filled with woods and wolves; some might want to heed the General Secretary's advice. But for those who dare to wander through the wolf-filled woods this is an exciting, unexpected, and grippingly original story. It is a book that I have read a couple of times and enjoyed even more with each reading. It is also a book that I intend reading again before too long. I hope that you too find it an enjoyable and satisfying read.

0060751967|5.0|I picked this one up at the bookstore to read the back cover and found myself at the store's coffee counter buying a drink so i could start reading it then and there... <br /> <br />Who knew vampire life could be so complicated and so absurdly funny? But hey, when you run a multi-million dollar company that caters to mortals and the undead alike things are bound to get a little strange from time to time.  So when one of Romatech's VPs brings in the latest project for their CEO, Roman Dragonesti, to review even Roman finds the project a little over the top.   <br /> <br />But after a little push from the Marketing Director Roman decides to sink his teeth into this latest project, literally! But things don't go as planned and pretty soon Roman finds himself sans fang.  Not wanting to be known as a \\"one toothed wonder\\" Roman seeks out an all night dentist and finds himself face to face with the very mortal and possibly very tasty Dr. Shanna Whelan. <br /> <br />While the good doctor strongly objects to placing a \\"dog\\" tooth in his mouth, the mafia finds that it strongly objects to her breathing! So instead of fixing his tooth Roman finds himself saving the good dentist.  What follows is a great tale of adventure and fine dentistry. But i wouldn't want to spoil it by telling everyone!
0805028846|4.0|I you have ever wondered how pop up cards work, and wanted to try them, this is the book for you. The basic principles are explained and shown very well. If you work through this book in order, you will be able to make pop-ups and sculptures that will amaze you. All you need is this book, a pencil, scissors and typing or copy paper. Give yourself plenty of time. The individual projects are not hard, but you will not want to stop. The only criticism I have is that some of the more complex projects, toward the end, could use a little more explanation.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Excellent movie!  Good character development, reasonable premise for the movie, and good acting. The main character's wife is a dedicated doctor who refuses to leave a patient in need and the son saving as many as possible when the worst is about to happen.  The Scottish character's comments about the question, \\"Can scotch be burned in the generator?\\" was great, \\"....are you mad?  That's 12 year old scotch!\\" and then pulls out a book to find 3 glasses hiding behind it. <br /> <br />As of the writing of this review, there is a class 4 hurricane bearing down on New Orleans, LA and Biloxi, MS.  The idea of massive storms correcting our global warming is feasible.  The inclusion of the frozen mastodon was a nice touch!  Most everyone knows of the stories of instantly frozen mastodons with flowers in their mouths and this movie provided vivid realism of how instant freezing can occur.  My 10 year old son and my mother watched this movie.  The realism and sheer terror of the possibilities went over my son's head.  But my 77 year old mother thought it was the best movie she had seen in years.   <br /> <br />I must say, I agree with my mom for once! The Day After Tomorrow is the best movie I have seen in a long time!   <br />
0316172324|4.0|One of the criticisms of this book is that is nothing more than a string of anecdotes.  For the first few chapters, I was of the same mind.  However, even if that were the case, the anecdotes themselves are interesting enough to keep one moving through the book at a rapid pace.  In the end the stories drew me in, convincing me that there was a real phenomenon that the author describes as \\"thin-slicing\\" (making a decision at an essentially subconscious level based on a few pertinent pieces of data).  I was intrigued enough to finish the book, hoping to see if Gladwell succeeded in his goals of describing where thin-slicing can be successful, where it fails, and what one can do about it.<br /><br />I would say that he had mixed success.  Does he lay out a comprehensive blueprint for using thin-slicing - no.  However, he does succeed in raising awareness about this phenomenon and where it might apply in daily life.  In particular, the descriptions of situations in which thin-slicing breaks down are generalizable.<br /><br />For example, after reading the book, I am now more open to the possibility that bias might color my hiring decisions.  The description of the results of blind versus unblinded auditions can be applied to any interview situation.  In the future, I will take more steps to avoid this.<br /><br />Another example is the description of how our ability to read subtle clues breaks down in high-stress situations.  I work in the medical field, and these lessons can be used to minimize decision-making failures in medical emergencies.<br /><br />Finally, the description of how over-analysis can paralyze judgment can be applied in any catastrophe.  In the twin towers attack of 9/11, there are reports that workers in the second tower were told to wait for more information before acting.  Some did as they were told.  Others trusted their gut instinct that things were not safe and left.  The ones who \\"thin-sliced\\" are the ones who lived.<br /><br />So - if you understand that this is a superficial introduction to a complex topic, I think it is an enjoyable and thought-provoking book.  It reads very quickly.  If you hesitate to pay for a hard cover that you will finish in a few hours, this might be one to put on your paperback watch list.roduction to a complex topic, I think it is an enjoyable and thought-provoking book.

B00005JNJT|3.0|This movie shows us how Batman begins and how Bruce Wayne became the Caped Crusader and it is an impressive film with an impressive cast from Michael Cane to Tom Wilkinson.  Unfortunately, it fails to measure up to the summer blockbuster, Star Wars- Revenge of the Sith, by the best movie of 2005.  Sure, I saw Batman Begins twice and I enjoyed the movie but Christian Bale doesn't have the appeal of George Clooney or Michael Keaton.  By the far worst actor to play Batman would be Val Kilmer in Batman Forever because he lacked the maturity of George Clooney and Michael Keaton. <br /> <br />Batman Begins is a good movie but fails to measure up to Star Wars- Revenge of the Sith. <br />

B0002EXH40|5.0|Just to start off I would give Reckoning Day a 100/100 it is easily my favorite song on here with its classic opening, good lyrics, and drum solo at the end. The rest of the cd is great also. Actually, the only two I really skip often are Elysian Fields (starts good but falls apart) and Black Curtains (I always seem to tune it out when listening so I guess its just boring). Victory is a commercial song, but it's one of my favorites. Starts fast ends faster. Lots of solos. Killing Road is arguably the heaviest with its opening bass, then drums, then guitar, and is also one of the catchiest. I feel that Youthanasia as a song is severely underrated. The drums are absolutely amazing, and who can skip it with the shredding solos. A Tout Le Monde, as much as I like to pick the unfamous songs on cds over the more well known, is arguably the best song on here. Great lyrics and vocals, best solos on the cd I think. The bonus tracks aren't special (milenium of the blind really doesnt have vocals but the solos are good) although the A Tout Le Monde demo is one of the few demos i will listen to more than once in a row. Not better than the regular but good in a different way. It has a unique solo. <br /> <br />Overall this cd gets an A <br /> <br />Whoops I forgot. Addicted to Chaos gets second best honors. It reminds me of Alice in Chains. Also Train of Consequences is good but it didn't strike me as amazing.

B000002J03|4.0|Led Zeppelin II is amazing! It includes (in my opinion) some of their greatest hits such as Moby Dick, Whole Lotta Love, and Ramble On. I highly recommend this CD to anyone.

Whether you're a Led Zeppelin fanatic, or a new fan, this CD is a must have!!!!!
0385720920|4.0|Chuck Palahniuk does it once again. In this book he introduces us to a loser who basically pays his bills and his crazy mother's medical bills by pretending he is choking in fancy restaurants and letting people \\"SAVE\\" him. Thus, making people feel responsible for him and eventually giving him money. This character is also a sex addict who goes to his sex addict anonymous meetings to pick up chicks. There is a big twist at the end as there are in all of his books but its definitely worth all the grizzly details about sex and bowel movements the reader must endure in order to get to the books big finale.
1592400876|2.0|Reviewing \\"Eats, Shoots, & Leaves\\" in The New Yorker, one of the world's most carefully edited literary magazines, Louis Menand notes that the first punctuation error in this book \\"appears in the dedication, where a nonrestrictive clause is not preceded by a comma. It is a wild ride downhill from there.\\" The rest of Menand's article proceeds to tear Lynee Truss a new one, pointing out dozens of unforgivable grammar mistakes. To top it all off, Gotham Books chose not to make any changes to the American edition of this British book. We all know that British English is a horse of a different colour and follows slightly different \\"rules\\". It sure takes guts for a book like this to advocate the intolerance of grammar gaffes.

Great flicks!
B00006LIRI|3.0|I have just bought the US version of this album and am quite diasappointed. Where is The Fly? -  one of my favourite U2 songs. I didn't buy it in the UK (where I'm from) as I thought I'd get it cheaper over here. Yes I did, but have now got an album with less songs than the UK version. I should have waited until I got back home. However, there are some great songs on there, e.g. Mysterious Ways, Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me and One.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This package is superbly done. The  DVD case is brilliant. Well styled, with a great Booklet and just visually  beautiful.  As a package, it really is visually great on all levels, and the audio is brilliant.Great  booklet in the slipcase, excellent visuals on the cover that repeats one of the CD best of covers with an added  flair that just defies a picture description, but once you see ( and feel) the raised cover, you will see the artistic pre-eminence.  I am, I admit, a big Joe Walsh fan, so this concert is dynamite. However, that being said, the concert features all members in an equal  share, and all the hits are played. From  start to finish this is a total  buzz.  The features are great, but to my mind not as much as I would have liked. The discussion of the EAGLES with all main members is great, and reveals a lot about the past , present and future of the band.   The band is not really a show band like some, but the band you see is visually great. More to the point this is a musicians band, and also an entertaining band... something almost anyone can appreciate. With Diamond level sales, this band has touched more than  3 generations of people, and will likely  touch your heart on many levels, as a band that brings back memories, and as a band that creates new memories. In all respects, this band is great in concert, and superb in sound and visual; which is a surprise in part given that the venue it plays in the this DVD, The ROD LAVER  ARENA is an absolute toilet... something I saw first-hand when I saw ACDC  play there in about 2002. However, the EAGLES  as shown are great, and fly high.

0790740443|4.0|\\"Soldier\\" is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. A friend gave it to me - thanks, bud. <br /> <br />The movie starts out really strong. I found it to be pretty believable in the beginning. As it shows Todd progress from baby to ruthless soldier/killer, the progression is very interesting to watch. It is a strong part of the movie of which I wish we had seen more. <br /> <br />The middle of the movie comes to life quite well also. I enjoyed watching as Sgt. Todd interacted with regular people and tried to come to grips with being human. This is another really strong part of the movie, and I wish this part could have been extended a bit more, to have let us seen the soul of the man. Watching him trying to adjust into \\"normal\\" life is one of the best parts. <br /> <br />Ironically, the worst part about the movie about a soldier is when the movie requires him to start doing action scenes as a soldier. There was nothing wrong with Kurt Russell's performance at all, but the plot at this point started to seem very contrived.  <br /> <br />I disliked the fact that they made the bad commander guy to be \\"evil\\" by having him make fun of the old troops, criticize the one new soldier for losing his eye, and other silly instances. That was not necessary. It was also not necessary to show that he is a coward by having him piss on himself.  <br /> <br />I feel that the end of the movie would have been more effective had they shown the attacking troops attacking for a legitimate reason other than \\"the enemy commander is evil and we need to give Sgt. Todd somebody to fight.\\" As I said, the whole fight sequence seemed contrived. It was interesting to watch, to be sure, but the story by that point was pretty darn weak and getting weaker and weaker. <br /> <br />Luckily the movie redeems itself at the very end, narrowly in time just before the credits come up. So it does have a good ending. But I just keep thinking to myself that this movie could have been more than what it was. It started out as an intense psychological sci-fi war movie and ended up as a cheap action flick. A little bit disappointing. <br /> <br />My favorite part in the movie is where Todd puts on the facial war paint and says, \\"I'm going to kill them, sir.\\" You've got to love that part! <br /> <br />As others have mentioned, this movie tries to rely on story rather than special effects. I think it succeeds for the most part. The special effects are still quite good though. The junk scenery backgrounds were downright breathtaking. I was really impressed by those effects, and that doesn't happen often. Usually movies these days are so busy cramming effects down your throat, one after another, in such fast sequence that you never have time to appreciate them. (Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith immediately spring to mind). I like the style of this movie much better. <br /> <br />Kurt Russell's performance as Sgt. Todd is extremely effective. The minimalist approach works best here, and he does an outstanding job. The man still looks awesome in a flat-top. He's looked cool in one ever since Stargate. (That movie was the reason I tried to wear a flat-top, for a while. It seems my head is just not the right shape for such an animal :) <br /> <br />So the bottom line: this is a great movie. The only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is that I feel like it could have been more. While the movie was good, the action portion of the story left me feeling a little unsatisfied. This may be the type of movie that would have done better if it had been written with less action and more of a character-driven story. But I've got no real complaints. Recommended.
B0002OERI0|1.0|It's ironic that Green Day bitches about \\"American idiots\\" when they're pretty idiotic themselves. The reason I hate Green Day is because they're songs are irritating. The lead singer needs to pull his head out of his ass so he can realize that he can't sing worth a sh** and he's too damn old to be making pop music, and the other band (I use the word band loosely here) members need to do the same. I don't care how political Green Day is, it doesn't justify their lack of talent. Micheal Moore is political and he happens to be a nut job, so that goes to show that being \\"political\\" doesn't neccesarily make you intelligent. Any moron can bitch about politics. If I criticized Green Day to someone in person, they might give me the old \\"everybody else likes them\\" cliche. The reason why \\"everybody else\\" likes Green Day is because appearantly, \\"punk\\" is the new fad. Remember the whole boy band fad? \\"Everybody\\" used to love N*Sync and the Backstreet Boys, but now most people hate them. I don't consider Green Day to be punk, but that's not why I hate them. I hate them because their music is tacky and annoying, plus it's overplayed and overrated. If you want to listen to some good rock, try Led Zepplin or Danzig.

B000007U6V|4.0|And they were still using non-electronic instruments.  Violin and guitar are on this album if I am not mistaken.  The track \\"Autobahn\\" is a nice, sleek, composition.  The remaining four range from glistening like sunlight off your VW bug's dashboard (Kometenmelodie 2) to slow and subtle uncoverings (K.melodie 1) to downright creepy (Mitternacht)...to pleasant (Morgenspaziergang, which means \\"Morning Walk\\").  Compared to previous releases, I wish the last two tracks on seit 2 were longer--they could be developed more--but all in all this is a good album, worth it for the title track alone. <br />Someone needs to reissue all of Kraftwerk's albums, esp. the early stuff!
6305949980|5.0|This movie demonstrates why one ought to be happy with who they are.  It's quite \\"dark\\" and can be frightening for younger viewers.  I love the soundtrack and the movie's unique style.  Can't wait for \\"Corpse Bride\\" to come out!
B000068FUS|5.0|I discovered DBT by accident--they were on someone's playlist on iTunes.  I downloaded a few songs and got hooked on their brand of Skynard meets Haggard meets The Clash meets Mojo Nixon rock-and-roll.  But the kicker was catching their show at the Fillmore in San Francisco--Jesus God, they play hard.  I'm seing them next month at the Austin City Limits Festival and catching their club show on the side.  Southern Rock Opera represents a shift in the band's make-up and playing, from a sort of ironic country and country-rock band to a three-guitar-attack rock band.  This is supposed to be a concept album, but it works better as a loose collection of good-to-great songs revolving around populist politics and raising hell.  Probably the least \\"country\\" of their catalogue.
B000002OZY|4.0|It's true, this was not the first concept album.  Townshend acknowledges the fact that the Pretty Things' \\"S.F. Sorrow\\" was a major inspiration.  In my opinion, S.F. Sorrow, which was recorded at the same time and place as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band and Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is the better of the two albums.  <br />In my opinion, the story that the Pretty Things tell in S.F. Sorrow is more engrossing and interesting - the album is also much more psychedelic in style.   <br /> <br />Years later, Townshend denied the fact that S.F. sorrow influenced him in any way, despite what he said in the past. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the Pretty Things are the unsung heroes of the rock world, never reaching any concrete commercial success. <br /> <br />Do the band justice and buy S.F. Sorrow and compare it to tommy, you'll be surprised.
0790731002|2.0|What is this?? What's with all the Neon and cheesy, campy lines?? It feels like we're going back to the Adam West days! (NOW, that's a bad thing, but back THEN thats how the comics were). With lines like 'Chicks dig the car.' and 'I'll get drive through' right after we've gotten Tim Burton's masterpieces it makes one feel woozy. This movie is a prime example where the merchandise is better than the movie (Batman and qustion mark symbol glass from McDonald's, anyone?). It gets worse (Batman and Robin) before it gets better (Batman Begins). Bob Kane must be thrashing in his grave.

0780020685|5.0|This film has been written about so much, what could I add that hasn't already been said? This movie has been extremely influential, or should I say bluntly, ripped off by many filmmakers. It's the first \\"buddy\\" movie, guys get together to rob a bank, protect a village, etc. It was re-made as a western called \\"The Magnificent Seven.\\" \\"The Wild Bunch\\" and \\"Ocean's 11\\" also are indebted to this great film. As with so many classics, it's lasting influence has resulted in its diminished impact with modern viewers. But rest assured that this film holds up to repeated viewings. The relationships between the samurai, between the samurai and the villagers, and between the bandits, the villagers along with their protectors are fleshed out in great detail. It's an ordered, yet complex society brilliantly brought to life. Also, the cinematography is excellent even though some parts of the film are scratchy and/or faded. Lastly, the audio commentary (Criterion Collection DVD) is also very informative and can contribute greatly to a deeper understanding of the film.
B00005JL78|4.0|Argubly one of the best sci-fi stories made to film since Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Minority Report features the main theme to be questioned - Is it possible that we can stop a crime from being committed before hand? The Pre-Cogs are the driving force behind the concept backed up by solid technology of the mid 21st century. But there's a catch...is there a chance of catching the wrong person and letting the real guilty party walk away free? The idea of a pre-crime division has become a subject of fascination and debate among top scientists in the world as well as those in the government law-enforcement agencies today. <br /> <br />This is Cruise and Spielberg's first collaboration ever - but their relationship evolved way back in 1987. Originally slated to work together in Rain Man, Spielberg had to leave following work on the third Indiana Jones movie. While the novella presents the overall outline and concept of the story, filmmakers expanded the scope by putting in noir, mystery elements with a personal character driven-element of our protagonist (we see it in the middle of the movie) together with the futuristic impression of what's it like in 2054. And the story has evolved a lot more better than its novella due to pre-production delays. <br /> <br />Production values were high here from its designs to visuals as well as to its convincing acting and sounds/music. Most of the crew whom worked with Spielberg were veterans in the business having collaborated with him personally in more than 10 of his films. As an anecdote for the visuals, even though grainy and blue in hues and partly hand-held, they are part of artistic reasons - showing the kind of guerilla-filmmaking in the future and intending to make audiences feel the coldness, immediate  <br />danger and the feeling of participation. Towards the end of the opening segment, audiences were given an emotional scare - a 30-second countdown (if you time properly) for Anderton to reach the room. What about the eye-candy shots (Part of what Spielberg films have) of components lowering down in the car factory? Those shots let you feel of being in a roller coaster thing. Those two above demonstrates the great editing that makes the movie less than boring. <br /> <br />Eagle-eye fans of Kubrick's films would be happy to see several moments that serves as homages to Kubrick. Also, the car-factory segment is actually Ernest Lehman's abandoned concept for supposed to be scene in North By Northwest. <br /> <br />Despite big production value, the weakest link of the movie is indeed some of the elements in the movie itself. The ending was quite a difficult thing to work out after well built and thought-out first two acts of the movie. Filmmakers were trying to come out with a satisfying end but still lacks the expected standard. As we go into the second act, there's a loophole maybe more than one. For instance after Anderton is declared a fugitive most systems in the Pre-Crime HQ should no longer accept his entry but the logic was not appropriate. The worst of all is that by the second-act it is detracting from a supposed to be noir story as Lara was brought in into the fray. The old man Burgess was the most wasted character of all - he should be given more depth. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, it's a great sci-fi story taken from Phillip Dick's vision of the future to the current reality. It's worth the watch, even though it's a lengthy 150 minute feature.  <br /> <br />Just watch it and be immersed with the future.  <br /> <br />[Reviewed by my friend Melvin, from Malaysia]
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This is an outstanding disc! <br />It's all that you'd expect from a Dream Theater release; great musicianship, great songs with thought-provoking lyrics. <br />From the opening, rocking track \\"Root of all Evil\\" to the final track, the 20-plus minute opus \\"Octavarium\\", this is one of their best.  <br />Other great tracks include \\"These Walls\\" and the best song on the disc; \\"Panic Attack\\". <br />If you get a chance check them out live. <br />I caught them a few weeks back in concert and they're just unbelievable live.
0375405380|5.0|I hadn't heard of Don Winslow until recently, when I checked out Power Of The Dog from my local library.  Wow!  I can't believe Winslow hasn't been getting more critical acclaim.  This guy is in the same league as James Ellroy and Michael Connelly.  Power Of The Dog is an epic treatment of the war on drugs with a complexity of plot and character that is riveting.  And Winslow has become a beautiful writer.  Certainly a nominee for best novel of 2005.

B000A7S4B0|5.0|BUY THIS ALBUM! Yes, it almost sounds like a completely different band, but it's fantastic. You can undeniably hear the influences of Neil Young, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and more on this practically flawless album. So much better and more accessible than BRMC's last release. Just don't expect a rocker... it's mostly mellow, but in the best way.<br /><br />\\"Ain't No Easy Way\\" (one of the few harder ones; it's a total foot-stomper) is one of the best singles I've heard all year.
0316168815|5.0|The Lovely Bones is an enlightening tale about a girl name Susie who on a walk home from school became the victim of rape and murder.  She watches her family grow up and apart and then later they come to live their lives again.<br /><br />As far as the book goes, there is no real central plot.  Some might say this is a very bad thing, but I ask you: what is plot?  How many of us actually read for plot?  Are we reading a book for plot or story?  The answer my friends is story.  And the Lovely Bones has a very enrichning storyline full of characters that will make you angry, and others that will make you smile.<br /><br />At first the story comes off as pretty blatant.  What's it all about?  What's the point of Susie watching the family.  But as the tale goes on it becomes clearer that this is not a story about finding Susie's murderer, but a story about where the home and the heart is.  A story about a grieving family that has to struggle through their own emotions to really become a family.  And Susie watches it all.  The collapse and reconstruction of her family over the years.<br /><br />Remarkably written, The Lovely Bones prose float off the page as literacy wonders, and soon become memorable lines in the reader's hearts.<br /><br />The story is a drama, full of emotion and a little bit of hope.  Alice Seabold does add a touch of humor to the story as well.  The story begins so horribly but then when you get to the end you realize just how uplifting the book really is.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is a wonderful tale that accurately portrays the realities of death and grieving, as well as compassion and togetherness.  Now quite in the league of To Kill a Mockingbird, but certainly a joyful read nonetheless.
0881030376|1.0|I had to read this book for my 9th grade English class and i must say this is the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life! it had the worst ending possible, I had to keep putting it down because it had the slowest plot in the world and had very flat characters. (Amazon suggests you buy this with To kill a Mockingbird which was the other book that was required for me and I highly suggest that book because it is a great book and one of my all time favorites.) AHHHHH!!!!! this book made me soo mad. They killed of my favorite character!!! and george did it how could he do that! Slim was my other favorite and so was candy but even Slim wasn't cool in the end. I hated this book so much. Don't read this its bad. Read to Kill a Mocking Bird its good. If you want to read something of John Steinbecks read the Grapes of Wrath.
B0009QTS1M|1.0|Please direct your attention to the review directly preceding mine.<br />If you're going to buy Gladiator then for heaven's sake buy this version.<br />http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00003CXE7/qid=1125353778/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-5526114-1392609?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846<br />Do not buy the extended version. The studios must be stopped from making these multiple versions of their movies on DVDs.<br />Backbeat is released by the studio with only a 2.0 track on it then released later in 5.1. Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas was giving similar treatment.<br />If you have a home theatre system then you have even less reason to buy this extended edition. Where do the studios get off releasing a movie with a DTS track on it then releasing a longer version missing the DTS track? They tried to do this with The Bourne Identity. Guess which one I'm keeping? That's right, the DTS version. Gladiator has one of the best DTS tracks ever on it, everything is so clear and perfectly balanced. I'm sick of the way the studios keep screwing over the public by not releasing the \\"Special\\" edition as the normal edition.<br /><br />Gladiator DTS:ES 6.1 is the only version of this movie that should be released. Help teach the studios that they can't screw us around like this.<br /><br />EDIT - JAN 2011 - The newly re-mastered Blu-ray version is of course the version you should be buying, complete with both versions of the film and a lossless high resolution soundtrack. The initial Blu-ray has been replaced. DVD just doesn't cut it, the BLu-ray is miles better.

B00005JN5X|2.0|In a recent interview, Matt Damon recounted a story told by Jonathan Pryce. Both actors appear in Terry Gilliam's new film \\"The Brothers Grimm\\". Pryce had just finished filming his first scene in \\"Brazil\\" and thought it went well. Prepared to move on, Pryce was startled when Gilliam wanted to do it again. Approaching the director, Pryce inquired about the reason for a retake. Gilliam put his hands on Pryce's shoulders, turned him around and said \\"Look at that set. You aren't registering against that.\\" Pryce's performance was too subtle against Gilliam's elaborate production design. It strikes me that this is, perhaps, the key problem with all of Gilliam's films.<br /><br />Wil and Jake Grimm travel the German countryside, circa 1812, banishing evil spirits from the rural villages, happily, for a fee. The Grimm Brothers are, in fact, con men, banishing the spirits they have created with smoke, mirrors and the aide of their two henchmen. Wil (Matt Damon, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", \\"Good Will Hunting\\") is the businessman, negotiating their fees with the local mayors and Jake (Heath Ledger, \\"Lords of Dogtown\\", \\"A Knight's Tale\\") is the romantic, recording every fable they hear. Soon, a French General (Jonathan Pryce) and his Italian aide (Peter Stormare) arrest the Grimm brothers. Napoleon has invaded Germany and controls everything. The General wants the Brothers Grimm to rid the town of Mar Baden of an evil spirit suspected of taking the town's young girls. If they succeed, they might be spared death.<br /><br />If there is anything Gilliam can do well, it is production design. For each film, he creates elaborate, beautiful and haunting designs transporting us to these places. He clearly devotes a large part of the filmmaking process to this part of his films. If \\"Brazil\\" and \\"Baron Munchausen\\" looked like they were created on sets, there would be no reason to remember them today. Gilliam's designs are massive and all encompassing, taking us along for the journey through these fantasies.<br /><br />Gilliam and Tim Burton are very similar filmmakers; each delights in creating the physical aspect of their fantastical worlds, each is clearly drawn to stories that are off center and unusual, and each brings an artists eye to the creation of these worlds. Each has also had varied success with the actors in their films and has a love affair with Johnny Depp, casting him in many of their respective films.<br /><br />I am a big fan of each director, but I am also maddened by both. They have each created some of the most memorable film experiences and also some dreadful, horrible wastes of time. Gilliam and Burton have difficulty dealing with the human element in their films. All of the production design in the world can't make up for wooden or hammy performances. Remember the story from Jonathan Pryce? This story is indicative of the problem with Gilliam's films. His production design drowns out any hope for subtle, lifelike performances, so Gilliam instructs his actors to act broad. As the production design becomes more outlandish, the actors feel it necessary to compete. The performances become more and more broad, louder and louder, and less and less human. This cycle that seems as though it will never end in Gilliam's films.<br /><br />Recently, a documentary was made about Gilliam's failed attempts to make a film based on the story of Don Quixote. The documentary, \\"Lost in La Mancha\\", detailed the constant funding problems the production had. Johnny Depp was cast as Sancho to Jean Rochefort's Quixote. This never completed film is especially intriguing because of the story. There doesn't seem to be a lot of opportunity for outlandish production design. Maybe a bit here and there, but the story would primarily have taken the two leads to barren landscapes in the Spanish countryside. Because of this, we might have had the opportunity to see Gilliam lead his performers to greatness. But it will never be. The closest we will ever see are the snippets included in the documentary.<br /><br />In \\"Grimm\\", Damon and Ledger are virtually always running around, shouting, arguing, screaming at each other, fighting with each other. But boy those sets look great. Each actor's performance easily ranks as one of their worst, and in Ledger's case, that's saying a lot. Ledger is an actor in search of a good role. None of his films to date have fulfilled any of the promise they may have had.<br /><br />Oddly, Jonathan Pryce's performance is very sedate. As the French General, he seems to be playing it almost straight to Peter Stormare's Italian aide. Stormare's character is amusing for the first few moments; his accent is thick and he seems intent on trying to kill anyone and anything they capture. But the character quickly wears thin and seems an odd match to Pryce's French General. Pryce adds a bit of a French accent and raises his eyebrows a few times at the antics of his aide, but that is about the extent of his performance.<br /><br />Monica Belluci appears in the film as well. This is another case of a beautiful woman who can't act appearing in countless films simply because of her looks. Her most successful American films were the second and third \\"Matrix\\" films, perhaps because she simply had to stand around and look exotic.<br /><br />The screenplay by Ehren Kruger (\\"The Skeleton Key\\", \\"The Ring\\") is interesting. Kruger works very hard to insert as many fairy tale references as possible. Some of them are clever and amusing, but it occurred to me, about halfway through the film, that it seems unlikely that these two guys would have one adventure, no matter how big, that inspired every single famous fairy tale they later recorded/ created. Seeds of everything from \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" (no pun intended) to \\"Rapunzel\\", \\"The Gingerbread Man\\" to \\"Snow White' make an appearance in some fashion. About halfway through the film, the process becomes a little monotonous and slapdash. References seem thrown in at any available point, whether they have a purpose to the story or not. The \\"Gingerbread Man\\" reference seems particularly tacked on.<br /><br />Kruger crafts the rest of the story well. Refashioning the brothers as con-men who are reluctantly called into duty provides an immediate sense of danger to the story and making the Napoleonic occupation a backdrop are interesting touches, but the main characters get lost. At one point Wil and Jake are fighting each other for the affections of a woman. It isn't really clear what Wil sees in her or what the outcome of this storyline is.<br /><br />If you can sit through two hours of interesting images, and perhaps tune out the dialogue and story, you might enjoy yourself. Otherwise, \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" is a miss, a big miss. Not really worthy of a rental either.see are the snippets included in the documentary. <br /> <br />In \\"Grimm\\", Damon and Ledger are virtually always running around, shouting, arguing, screaming at each other, fighting with each other.

B0002OERI0|5.0|A concept album?  Keen.  The audacity of such a retro artistic <br />move in the \\"Day of the iPod\\" deserves plaudits.  Oh, and the  <br />music it contains is well above-average too.  BTW, if you like <br />this, then check out ancient stuff from Black Flag and/or  <br />Henry Rollins.  My sole complaint about American Idiot is that  <br />the story line is a bit unoriginal - not that I could do better, of course, but even more surrealism might have suited  <br />the material.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|This really is an incredible film which manages to capture the decadant permissiveness of Berlin and it's cultural diversity, leading as it inevitably does, to the raise of facism.<br /><br /> The songs march from fun to anxiety, the dance numbers are tight, clipped, toned and fascinating and stamped indelibly with the Fosse seal. Minnelli is frothy and energeticly in denial of reality and real emotion, York is stifled, stumbling and yet intellectual aware while Gray guides us through the path of decadance he embodies so well for Berlin of the 1920's, while steering us to sights and sounds we fail to be aware of amidst the fun. His over painted face belies the truth of the misery ahead but he slips out titbits for those brave or wise enough to take.<br /><br />There are stunning and graphic scenes of the horrors of war and nazism brought to us through the eyes of artists and bohemians from many genres who actually witnessed the change in Berlin.<br /><br />The opening number includes an exact recreation of a famous Otto Dix potrait, hidden amongst the audience.<br /><br />Steamy, sexy, glossy, full of energy and yet menacingly<br /><br />forboding. Says more about the real cost of dictatorship than any straight war film I have ever seen. Brilliant and classic!

Personally I would say that it is nice cross of Morrison, Otis Redding, and Bob Dylan, with some contemporary notes of the 21st century as well. Like lower result, its voice is strongly emotive and a perfect foil for the somewhat minimal and honest production on the disc. The album is uniformly excellent, and never monotonous. Its motionless growth on me, but feel Lamontagne of I has more remaining power than Jack Johnson, or any lyric writer of singer of this generation unless Elliott Smith (TEAR). Obtain on this album early, it is guaranteed to be sensational success. If all is well Lamontagne a long career will have. These songs are such a joy to test.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I recently saw Celtic Woman in Boston, after only seeing bits and pieces of this video on public television.  I was blown away at the concert by the magnificence of their voices and special lighting effects.  On the way out, I heard someone say that they stuck very close to the songs and style on the video, which led me to buy this.  The video was filmed inside an auditorium, so it differed from the breezy outdoor arena where I saw them, but the clarity of the music and the softly sung passion in their voices came through quite nicely.  They sing so effortlessly and the music just fills my soul and takes me back to that warm summer night in Boston where I first heard them.  The fiddler who tosses her beautiful blonde hair, while leaping around on the stage without missing a beat is quite something to see as well.  The rich harmonies and melodies will transport you to wherever you want to go in your mind - just sit back, dim the lights and enjoy!

0767817486|4.0|Billy Hayes went to my high school, a few years ahead of me.  This was an all boys school on Long Island and when he was in jail at that Turkish prison we used to joke that it was better than being stuck in our high school, and also that on the whole the freshman class did more hashish every day than Billy Hayes was able to smuggle across the entire width of his body.  We encouraged to pray for the soul of our fellow schoolmate William Hayes who was languishing in prison, unjustly convicted.  Good looking guy, though not so sublime as Brad Davis, who plays him in the movie.<br /><br />Billy's girlfriend Susan, who joins him in a half-baked scheme to smuggle moderate quantities of hashish out of Istanbul, is played by the incredible Irene Miracle.  A year or so later she was to come into her element fully as Rose Elliot in Argento's masterful INFERNO, but here she is more subdued, though still ravishingly beautiful.  She and Brad Davis have got to be the hottest couple ever put on film.  Of course their love gets torn apart once the jail portion of the movie begins, around reel 3.  Giorgio Moroder, whose soundtrack is one of the epochal moments of 1970s cinema, wrote a beautiful love theme for Billy and Susan, it is tender and filled with longing and frustration.  Sometimes I hear that theme played even on elevator Muzak and even now it brings back all the sorrow of lovers violently parted from each other, like Nino Rota's theme from the Zeffirelli ROMEO AND JULIET.<br /><br />Is the movie racist for depicting Turks as menacing, ugly, brutish thugs?  Maybe so.  Maybe that's the lure of the movie, to suck you in telling you this is a true story and thus letting your moral judgments get go off the hook.  The book on which this book is based shows a different angle on the story (in addition, Billy admits to enjoying sex in prison with men, an element that Oliver Stone excised out completely, later making up for it I suppose by including Jared Leto in his movie ALEXANDER), but while watching MIDNIGHT EXPRESS all you experience is fear.  I'm sure that the success of this movie led to the depressing statistic that only 19 per cent of Americans own or use passports.  The rest of us are too terrified of going overseas and being hung upside down naked in chains and flogged by Turks.ching MIDNIGHT EXPRESS all you experience is fear.

B0002XVQNU|3.0|Longer and slightly more violent cut of Mark Paul Johnson's 2003 cinematic adaption of the hit Marvel comic series adds more detail to the story and characters but is not likely to convert any of those unimpressed with the original cut. Ben Affleck is blind lawyer/superhero Matt Murdock who battles evil in the court-room by day and on the streets by night. His biggest opposition is criminial master-mind, Kingpin, and his hired assassin, Bullseye, who frame him for the murder of a business associate who happens to be the father of Murdock's love interest, Elektra (the stunning Jennifer Garner). Of course, this sends sweet Elektra over the edge and out for revenge.<br /><br />The R-rated cut of the film has a few extra curse words and some more intense fight scenes but overall, the movie still plays out like a \\"PG-13\\". The most noticeable difference is the addition of a subplot involving a murder suspect played by Coolio who calls on Murdock's firm to represent him. A romance scene between Affleck and Garner has been removed and replaced with a more appropriate post-fight conversation. There are a number of other added scenes which fans will more than likely enjoy but as already mentioned, it really doesn't change the end product much aside from making the movie longer.<br /><br />\\"Daredevil\\" is neither the best or worst of the countless comic book adaptions. It's nowhere near as good as Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" though its far better than a good deal of the films being made as of late (i.e. \\"Hulk\\", \\"The Punisher\\"). It has a lot of the same over-produced CGI action sequences that are all the rage and a good portion of its all-star cast seems to be content with their phoned-in performances. It does have its share of entertaining moments but even with the extra character moments included in the \\"director's cut\\", the film still seems to lack depth in its storytelling. Where superhero films like \\"X-Men\\" possessed a dramatic undertone and commentary on society as a whole, there's not much of that to be found here. It's by no means, a mediocre film but even with the added thirty minutes, it still leaves a lot to be desired in certain areas., there's not much of that to be found here.

B0007ORU66|5.0|contrary to what a previous reviewer said, this cd must have been released on cd format, because i have a copy and am listening to it as I write this.  Also, amazon obviously has some used copies. I got mine off [...], an online mp3-buying store. So, if you want it, you can probably get it there or right here at amazon.  If I'm not mistaken, this one was origionally not too hard to find on LP format, was only released on cd format in Europe.  I really can't understand why.  Beatles fans, don't overlook this one.  It has some of their best and most known songs, not to mention the not-so-radio friendly gem, \\"rain.\\"
019280264X|4.0|The protagonist of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price, was one very near and dear Jane Austen's heart, but did not win a great deal of favor with the reading public. Fanny seemingly emulates the standards of moral feminine behavior for the time period, and unlike other Austen heroines, is not obviously spunky. However, her spunk is evident in her intelligence and unwillingness to sacrifice her principles in any circumstance, even circumstances that would elevate her into high society. I can see why Mansfield Park was Austen's favorite novel. There is an illusion of decorum on the surface, like all her work, but the undercurrent in this particular work is much darker than her other novels. The West Indian slave trade, sexual jealousy, infidelity, and the question of human worth all pervade the novel and instill the reader with the sense of discomfort that Fanny feels throughout. My only critique is the ending, a rather cursory tying up of the intricate story that does not match the complexity of the novel's body. A first rate novel, though, for those who want to take the time to unravel Austen's meaning and give Fanny Price a deeper look.

B000002UA0|5.0|The Beatles should have taken more acid, and maybe they would have succeeded the brilliance of this album.<br /><br />SGT.PEPPERS was a poor attempt to be like at the time underground rocker SYD BARRETT and his band, THE PINK FLOYD.<br /><br />This was the only Syd album (1967) and the work is primarily his.<br />Syd fans are usually divided from commercial Floyd fans. I am devoted to both.<br />He may not grab you right away but it creeps on you. This is the real ACID ROCK album.<br /><br />You are transported into this guys mind and it  is one strange assed place to be.<br /><br />ASTRONOMY DOMINE will likely turn on all FLoyd fans but the rest of this album is a different ride.<br /><br />Curiosity turned the cat into a HEAD FACE .<br />Dont forget about SYD BARRETTS two solo albums later on.
B0007TKNII|5.0|\\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is a wonderful film! \\"Wooden\\" Raoul aside, the principal players lived up to the larger than life challenge of making the story believeable, in a way that the play did not. But a play is a play, and a film is a film: two totally different genres that ought not be compared. The film is a visual feast of glorious sights and beautiful sounds. I liked the evil sensuality of the Phantom, and the glowing Emmy Rossum's wide-eyed naivete played perfectly, and added that spark of life so necessary to all great films. I thought the outdoor scenes were some of the most exquisite in recent years. The softly falling snow, the hiding Phantom, the \\"cold and monumental\\" graveyard, and Christine's angelic, heartwrenching \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\"...not to mention Raoul in hot pursuit on horseback...now THAT's a tough act to follow! Let's not forget Minnie Driver's hilarious, self-absorbed \\"Carlotta\\", and the cool, steady, understated Miranda Richardson's Mme. Giry. \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is two and one-half hours of well-spent entertainment. In the footsteps of the brassy perfection of \\"Chicago\\", \\"Phantom\\" is sure to convince people that they might like \\"musicals\\" after all!
B000024D4R|5.0|THE GOOD NEWS<br /><br />Do not  be afraid of the fact that there is only five tracks.<br /><br />Just like WISH YOU WERE HERE and DARK SIDE before it the album is without fault. A gem from start to finish.<br /><br />Roger Waters was only starting to go crazy and his bitterness hasn't grown stale yet. In fact here its fresh and it bites hard.<br /><br />PIGS DOGS AND SHEEP: all have some sort of political meanings that I don't really give a crap about. This album is not about the words so much as about the music. The band plays as a whole and really jams out.<br /><br />FOR MOST PEOPLE DARK SIDE IS THE FLOYD CONVERTER: It was mine too. THE one that turned me on to Floyd. This one here is the best. No doubt. Play it really loud.<br /><br />THE BAD NEWS<br /><br />ANIMALS (1977) is the one where ROGER WATERS finally decided that he was the owner of PINK FLOYD. Though we know that he never should have been so greedy. What started here peaked in '79 (The WALL) and crumpled in '83 with a peice of crap called THE FINAL CUT.<br /><br />Roger Waters break down wasn't as fun as his long lost companion SYD BARRETT's and it is sad that he couldn't just get over his \\"control\\" problems.<br /><br />It wasn't long until  the real PINK FLOYD would become just a fond memory.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I have really become a Coldplay fan since Sarah McLachlan expressed her love for them in one of her concerts.  Although the album seems (at first) to contain a bit too much of Chris Martin's falsetto, it still grows on you with each listen and soon becomes some familiar melodies you find yourself humming throughout the day.  A couple of songs are VERY reminiscent of U2 but even Martin admits to plagiarizing their sound, as well as those of other popular groups.  Personally, I don't care...there's just something about Coldplay that makes me keep yearning for their melancholy but maniacal music.

1400095913|3.0|I loved the concept of this book: Serial killer with a (somewhat shaky) moral compass.  Dexter is a sociopath who has learned to mimic human behavior and fake his own humanity even as he indulges his \\"Dark Passenger\\".  It's an intriguing premise with an oddly likable anti-hero.  So there's great potential here.  But, there's a problem.<br /><br />It can be difficult to get a good sense of supporting characters in a first person novel.  When the first person narrator is a self-professed sociopath who doesn't bond or connect with other humans, it can be near impossible.  Everyone but Dexter (and possibly, the ever practical Harry) is flat and one-dimensional in this novel.  The reader can't bond with any of the supporting characters, much less the victims, because Dexter can't.  What we're left with is an engaging and interesting protaganist, a plot that intrigues and is well paced but very little emotional investment in, or satisfaction from, the story.  But then, maybe that's the point?
B0007GAERG|5.0|First of all, Emancipation of Mimi is a teriffic,feel-good,cool album and deserves a definite shot-out from me...there are classic style Mariah flavorings and new-school Mariah..Its all good, and to those (Obvious) HATERS, most people will judge for themselves and see through your desperate attempts at sabatoging an already super successful record...also, anybody judging Mariah on anything but her music needs to stop it and get a life...get to know your family and friends first, then an entertainer second...just listen and appreciate her talent, voice and song-writing craft..all of which madonna, with her dependency on shlock-value, could never hope to aspire to, though she tries...I respect them both, but Madonna fans, like Mariah fans, are crazy and when comparing the completely different styles of the two, one must point out that Mariah is a vocalist and Madonna is a show-woman...a dancer..a moderate dancer....truth be told...Glad to see Mariah reaching such major success again, after 15 years in the biz..I see Mimi going 5x Platinum b4 the year is out and Grammy is calling her name...

B0009K7QZ8|4.0|While the scripts, stories and acting aren't as wonderful as the brillaint first season of this great show, it still is a darned good show. However, there are some improvements that make this season great. <br />While last year she was a little over dramatic and not teen-like, Mischa Barton has improved in her role of Marissa Cooper this year. I personally think she should stop playing teenagers. The girl did Shakespeare off-Broadway when she was 7. Maybe she's too good of an actress to play Marissa, or maybe she just doesn't have chemistry with Ben McKenize. As Ryan, McKenzie shows a softer, less violent side this year, however, his look for the role is still better than his acting. <br />And now to the two gems of the show, Adam Brody and Rachel Bilson, as nerotic geek Seth Cohen and typical beach girl Summer Roberts. These two are probably the performers with the best comic timing and maybe the best acting abilty, second only to Peter Gallagher. How both of them have been overlooked for Emmys is very sad. <br />Peter Gallagher is an idol to many up and coming actors. He has tremednous range. He can play crooks comically like in \\"Mr. Deeds\\" and musically like in the stage revivals of \\"Pal Joey\\" and \\"Guys and Dolls.\\" However, I think Sandy Cohen will be the role he is best remembered for. Not only is he the center of the show, but he is the best characther. As his wife, Kelly Rowan shows a lot of growth this year, especially with her alcholic story line. <br />As Caleb Nichol, Alan Dale continues to be dreadfully boring and stuck up. However, I must say my new favorite adult woman on the show is Julie Cooper. With an obviosuly good sense of comic timing and great, still comic, acting skills, she has improved much this year. <br />Tate Donovan, who appeared in the finale and at the beginning of this season as Jimmy Cooper also is a strong moral center of the show.  <br />While last year told the stories of the four central teens, this year some others entered theirlives, mainly Zach, played by an actor who's name I can't recall and Alex, played by Oliva Wilde. While these kids were pretty good, they will probably not be as well remembered as Samaire Armstrong's charachter of Anna. <br />And as Trey, Mr. What's his name (sorry, I forgot the actor's name) is also just as brooding as McKenzie, but a much better actor. The atempted rape scene in episdoe 21 was scary and realistic, one of the best scenes all season. <br />This year, most of the memorable and well written episodes are by brillaint series creator Josh Schwartz. If only they'd do more audio commentaries and give us some more bonuse. <br />FOX should be proud of this show, it isn't your average Teen Soap.
B0009VCSXW|5.0|If there's anything you knew in advance about \\"Sin City\\" (aside from who gets naked -- show a little class dammit) it's that director Robert Rodriquez went as far out of his way as humanly possible to make this film adhere as closely as possible to the visual feel of the comic book source material. Well, I haven't read any of Frank Miller's legendary \\"Sin City\\" comics, but having seen the movie, I can't imagine it existing without them.Many people will see similarities between \\"Sin City\\" and the work of Quentin Tarantino, both because Robert Rodriquez will probably never break free from this stigma no matter how many kiddie flicks he makes, and more importantly -- gulp -- he actually inviteds QT on board to direct one of the segments, this after he'd torn up his DGA membership card in disgust after they wouldn't allow him to list Frank Miller as a co-director, so as far as integrity goes it's hard to one-up Sir Robert here. I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to which segment QT was supposed to be directing ahead of viewing this flick, and it's to the film's credit that it all seems of a piece no matter how the chores were divvied up.  <br /> <br />Now, there are a couple of things that are immediately going to weed out a certain part of the older audience (hello Ma!), this being the \\"artsy\\" use of black-and-white splashed here and there with purposeful primary colors, and also the integrity of the action sequences. I shouldn't diss the so-called \\"older\\" audience, being in my third decade of existence myself, but my parents and everyone else their age have certain prejudices toward a particular kind of modern film, this being the type that has \\"far fetched\\" action sequences. Yes, in \\"Sin City\\" the characters are able to take a ridiculous amount of bullets and keep on ticking as well as jumping out of windows several stories to the ground without any apparent injuries, but to that I say that there is a reason this kind of thing works in a film like \\"Sin City\\" whereas it can easily wear thin in a movie like, say, \\"The Matrix\\". Sin City is portrayed as a hopelessly fatalistic backdrop against which the best the characters can hope for is to die with a little bit of dignity. It doesn't really matter that Marv doesn't croak after taking a bullet to the head because you know the dice are gonna roll cold for him sooner or later.Another comparison people may make to Tarantino is to point out that \\"Sin City\\" is also an anthology film. I could mention the fact that this is based on three graphic novels featuring different protagonists and leave it at that, but -- at the risk of unduly diminishing the genius of Quentin Tarantino, whose \\"Pulp Fiction\\" is undeniably the most influential film of the 90s and a work of art in it's own right -- it should be noted that QT did not, in fact, actually INVENT the anthology film. No, that would be George Romero and Stephen King with \\"Creepshow\\" (I'm kidding, of course, but you get my point...).  <br /> <br />Aside from the anthology aspect, there is one thing that actually does somewhat resemble \\"Pulp Fiction\\": Bruce Willis' character makes an early exit only to return later in the film. It's not the same chronological gimmick that QT utilized but I've said enough as it is.The one aspect that got so much press in the film's pre-release was the unprecedented decision to film the entire movie in front of a green screen. This move not only doesn't come off as a gimmick but you'll find yourself forgetting that \\"Sin City\\" isn't absolutely real about five minutes into the movie. Sure, there are numerous improbabilities, as detailed above, but it's the MOVEMENT of the characters, vehicles, weapons, etc. that seem a bit cartoonish; nothing about the actual scenery really does. In essence, \\"Sin City\\" sticks to the elements that continue to make noir so compelling: great camerawork, gritty characterizations, and the theme of a hardened soul holding out some kind of remote hope for redemption. Bruce Willis was an absolute no-brainer for this flick: he's spent the last decade perfecting this world-weary gutter saint character, and \\"Sin City\\" is arguably his best portrait of this tortured soul archetype yet. Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke are the three main protagonists, and you'll find yourself rooting for them not through point-of-view bias alone, but because each of these guys completely earns the right to be called a bad ass. In a way I'm glad they saved the fate of Willis' character for last as the whole movie seems to be building to such tragedy.  <br /> <br />So, yes, it's unfortunate that so many people will rent this movie sheerly on the recommendation of Mr. Skin, but hopefully \\"Sin City\\" will turn more than a few heads on to a new, hightened quality of experimental film-making in the same way that the aforementioned \\"Pulp Fiction\\" did a decade ago. Word is that Rodriquez is planning two back-to-back sequels as we speak. <br />
B000021Y7X|5.0|This DVD is the best in my collection. Enjoyed some Talking Head cuts over the years but never bought any of their products until now. Man, where have I been? This is a gem of a performance that I find something new to appreciate everytime I watch it. Video and sound quality is top-notch. Song selection and performance outstanding. You may find yourself skipping ahead to certain songs at first, but before long, you put the remote down and enjoy the entire concert from start to finish, then debate watching it all over again when its over.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|For years I shied away from foreign films, Asian films in particular. I'm not a martial arts fan and I didn't want to bother with subtitles. Someone recommended a Korean film to me several months ago and I decided to give it a try. I've since rented several Korean and Japanese films and I'm hooked on Asian cinema. At a time when Hollywood is rehashing the same pointless drivel, finally I find films with heart! <br /> <br />A perfect example is Oldboy. Min-sik Choi plays a scoundrel, a man who gets drunk on his daughter's birthday and is arrested by the police for lewd conduct. The next thing he knows, he is locked into a hotel room where his only human contact is his television and the feet of his guard. He is periodically gassed into unconsciousness when his captors need to enter his room. He stays this way for fifteen years, unaware of who is holding him or why, until he is released one day unexpectedly. This all happens in the first ten minutes of the film. The rest of the film is his search for vengeance on the person or people who stole his life from him.  <br /> <br />This is the kind of film you feel in your guts. It's like the first time you watch Charles Bronson in Death Wish. You can't approve of what he's doing but you can't help cheering him on while he does it. Far from the staged acrobatics of a martial arts film, the violence in this film is as gritty and brutal as the best of Scorsese or De Palma. But it makes sense for the film and serves to underscore the theme, as opposed to the gratuitous violence you find in many American films. Far from a mindless action movie, this film has a poignancy that will stay with you for a long time. This is the way movies are supposed to be. <br />
B0009MDPYM|5.0|It gets harder and harder to find movies of this magnitude in the heap of modern movie reels. Honestly, folks, each time I go to see a new movie that promises me a totally new experience, I tremble all over because I'm really afraid to be disappointed.<br /><br />But my fears this time were in vain. The first minutes of the movie made me believe that this time I'm up for a great experience! And not a single frame of the film made me change my mind even for a second.<br /><br />Some say that this actual idea that all the world is at a war has been already used. So what? The potential of this kind of plots, just like the luck of the Irish, will never run out! And when you see the way the movie is done, you are sure destined to compare every other similar movie to this one!<br /><br />Everything in this feature is almost flawless. Every aspect from casting and costume design to special effects is done with such confident skill that you find yourself literally dissolving in the movie's atmosphere. It's just so believable it's nearly impossible, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Furthermore, I guess, the real success of the movie is that if you don't know it's based on a comic series, you'll have absolutely no idea that it's so. This work takes the story on an entirely new level, where even those who have never seen a comic book can appreciate the really fine idea brought to us by the really talented crew.
B0000C9V3T|1.0|Stupid movie, stupid music, and now we're stuck with that silly \\"Woo-Hoo\\" tune every time a Vonage commercial comes on TV. Sad that this crap is now entertainment to some.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Personally, I don't understand why anyone would give this CD a 1-star rating, unless they are people who have a habit of rating Mariah low or just don't like her music (or both).  \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" has a bit of something for everyone.  Fans of her old style will love \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Circles,\\" and probably \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" (a gospel song.  It's different hearing Mariah sing gospel, but it's interesting).  Fans of her new style will be fans of \\"It's Like That,\\" \\"We Belong Together,\\" \\"Shake You Off,\\" and \\"Say Something.\\"  But the best thing about her album is that she laces old and new concepts together -- the strong voice she showcased on ballads back in the 80s and 90s right along with the collaborations and hip hip beats she's been favoring recently -- into ALL of her songs.  So fans of old and new will be able to find something they like on each track.  Even people who aren't particularly fans of Mariah may appreciate this fresh new approach.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Isn't it amazing that her worst album oops I did it again is her best selling.And her best album in the zone is her worst selling all because of the new image, and the fact that the topics on this album are mostly about sex.So with that said nobody even bothers with this album and thats just not fair for Britney.A lot of people think her music is getting worse and she was better back then.Well thats not tru at all.Heres the facts.1.Back then she didn't write any of her songs.2.The topics of the songs were lame, being in love and breakups and other cheezy crap like that.And 3.All the songs sounded a lot alike, just a straight up teen pop beat with similar choruses.Now look at her these days.She's 1.Writing most of her songs.2.The topics are clever and cool.And 3.She's expirementing with the beats.And there you have it.As for this album, it rules as the best I have ever heard in my life.All the songs exepted 1 or 2 are superb.Its too bad she didnt release more singles because I'm sure that the songs showdown, the hook up and shadow would have been big hits.She should have done that instead of releasing greatest hits my perogitive.Now she has to make a comeback and if she would have released more singles, she wouldn't need to.And the album would have sold better.But O well we all make misteaks.                          1.Me against the music.At first you dont like this song, but it grows on you.The beat is cool and the lyrics are awesome.Great collaboration. 10/10.                       2.(I got that) boom boom.This the worst song on the album but everytime I listen to it, it's an okay listen 6.5/10. 3.Showdown.This song is cool.And if she would have released it, it would have been a huge hit. 10/10.        4.Breathe on me.Great song with some techno in it. 10/10. 5.Early mornin.Cool RnB track with awesome chorus. 10/10. 6.Toxic.The song we all know and love.Words can't describe how amazing and perfect this song is. 10/10      7.Outragous.Nice song.But I wish she had finished the video. 10/10.                                             8.Touch of my hand.Like another revewer said at first I thought that this song was about self confidence.But I realized that this song was about masterbation (why would it be called touch of my hand if it wasn't).Great song though. 10/10.                                            9.The hook up.Would have been a big hit. 10/10.           10.Shadow.Again, would have been a big hit.One of the best ballads I've ever heard in my life. 10/10.           11.Brave new girl.Fabulous message. 10/10.                12.Everytime.Britneys best ballad ever!Very relaxing.And the fact that she mostly wrote this song herself, makes it that much better.Great song. 10/10.                    13.Me against the music (remix).For a remix it's good but the origanal is better. 8/10.                             So in conclusion this album rocks!Good work Britney 5 stars. :-)
B00005JNTX|5.0|I think this movie is great to watch and really is unique.  I enjoyed this movie and all its effects.  Jessica Alba looks great even in black and white even though she doesn't have a huge part.  All the actors were great choices for the characters they played, so overall the movie get 5 stars but I was a little disappointed in the special features, or lack of.  It only has the making of the movie and some previews and that's it.  I don't really buy DVD's for the special features so it's no big deal to me but I expected more.  Awesome movie, empty DVD
6305428387|5.0|Having seen this film a number of times in the past, I just had to get a copy for my husband to watch. It is simply a barrel of laughs for the whole family. The night I received the film the family was over to watch and we all thoroughly enjoyed it - both young and old. <br /> <br />The film brings out the light-heartedness of the Jamaican characters and people. It proves one thing, where there is a will there, definitely, is a way.  <br /> <br />Cool Runnings sends out a universal message that is envisaged in the hearts and minds of peacemakers and should be envisaged in the hearts of all world leaders.
B0007GAEGC|4.0|This is a beautiful recording. I only wish there were more duet or group pieces - while the individual voices are lovely, there is sometimes some fullness missing. Chloe's voice is sweet, but lacks the depth of some of the others.
0895260131|5.0|This is NOT \\"Islam for Dummies;\\" nor is it another one of the countless politically correct (and dangerously misinformed) screeds about Islam as the \\"religion of peace.\\" Instead it is a concise, well researched and clearly written analysis of the fundamental militancy of the real Islam. It is Islam brought to life. <br /> <br />The second part of the book, a history of the Crusades, their beginnings as a response to Muslim agression, and a comparison of the Crusades with the bloody history of Islam clearly makes the case that while the Crusades were an aberration, Muslim agression is an integral part of the militant character of the religion of Islam. <br /> <br />Spencer makes his case using historical data, side-by-side comparisons of the tenets and goals of Christianity versus Islam, and the words of many of Islam's proponents, from Mohammad to the radical clerics of today. <br /> <br />This book, and Spencer's other contributions to this subject, should be read by every thinking person in the Western world.
0679423001|4.0|I did enjoy this book, but it's really not my cup of tea. It's a domestic drama, which unfolds over the twenty years between the world wars.  The protagonists are English nobility of the early twentieth century. The hero meets and falls in love with a (fellow male) classmate at Oxford.  The classmate eventually drifts off into a life of alchoholism while our hero becomes a celebrated artist. Later, after a marriage of convenience, he rediscovers and then falls in love with his old boyfriend's sister. Their love comes to nothing when the sister's dorment Catholic morality is reawakened.<br /><br />The thing that saves this book for me is the beauty of the prose. The man knows how to write and paints wonderful pictures of the English landscape, the lives of the priveledged and the torment of troubled souls.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, you'll have to decide for yourself if that sort of thing interests you.  For me, I kept waiting for the action to start. About halfway through the book, when I realized it never would, I decided to finish the book and simply enjoy the creation of a masterful writer.
0156027321|4.0|A simple recipe - a boy involving himself in three religions simultaneously, dealing with a hated name, and leaving India and his father's zoo with some of its animals and his family to emigrate to Canada.  Then, a shipwreck leaves Pi on a lifeboat with no other humans but more than one former member of his father's menagerie.    Survival on his own is imperative.  Doing so on an unforgiving sea with fellow passengers who might well construe him as a potential meal is seriously problematical.  Since Pi tells the story in first person voice, obviously he survives, but what a journey!  The journey's amazing.  Pi's knowledge of animals proves lifesaving.  If you're like me, the first half, before the shipwreck has enjoyable philosophical moments, but lasts a bit too long.  It's worth getting through to the shipwreck.  Be prepared to hold on tight with Pi.  The ending is a most pleasant surprise, casting upon things a perspective I hadn't considered.  A lovely read, all in all.
B0000028PI|4.0|I love this album.  It's a smart and creepy concept album that sounds more like the original Alice cooper group/ Welcome to my nightmare days than the early 80's \\"hey Stoopid\\" stuff.<br /><br />If you like the old style coop sound this is a great update from the king of creepy.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've got a DVD recorder and had already recorded this from DirecTV so really didn't NEED to purchase the commercial product. However, the 5.1 digital audio (not recordable to DVR) in and of itself was enough to get me to purchase the commercial DVD. It's well worth it, in my opinion!  <br /> <br />At the beginning of my first viewing I was a bit unsure of how I'd feel by the end of the program about Gerard Butler's voice (he's a bit harsher than Michael Crawford), I found myself really appreciating his interpretation of the character. My wife and I have seen Phantom at the Baltimore Hippodrome and Her Magesty's Theatre in London so we've got a bit of \\"Phantom experience\\". I was pleased at how the cinematography really fleshed out the story. The opening of the movie in an of itself is \\"worth the price of admission!\\" <br /> <br />Buy it! I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
B00004R9A4|5.0|My kids loved the movie.  I'm so glad you had it available for sale.  I had been looking for it in stores for some time.  The product was in excellent condition (new) and was shipped promptly.  Thanks! <br /> <br />
B00014NE62|5.0|What a wonderful love story!  As we follow Maurice through the trials and tribulations of gay life in the early 1900's, your heart can't help but feel for this man.  For anyone who has ever had their heart ripped from their chest, thrown on the floor, and stomped on like bad beef...this movie is for you!  The ending is such a redeeming factor, it inspires hope in all of us.  A true love story, whether you're gay or not!
B0006L5RT2|5.0|\\"Back to Bedlam\\" by James Blunt is a great CD. Seemingly undiscovered in the United States, I heard his song \\"You Are Beautiful\\" online through Virgin Radio UK, and searched out his CD. I had to order it online because it can't be found at the majority of music stores in the U.S. His voice can get a little high pitched at points, but I like the fact that he is different and not mainstream, and his lyrics are incredible. My favorite song on the CD is \\"Goodbye My Lover,\\" which gives me goosebumps everytime I listen to it!
0790729407|5.0|This is a chaper in history that is not covered in our history books.  Yet, it is the beginning of the period just before the \\"Celtic Tiger\\".
B000002G8H|5.0|This album is full of Clapton's greatest hits.  It has cocaine and wonderful tonight which are two of his best songs ever.  I have heard some say that this album is full of slow boring music, but if your a clapton fan it's anything but that.  I recommend this cd to every fan of Eric Clapton.
B000002J1O|5.0|The first time i listened to this album, i didn't really like it, but the second time, i loved it. All the songs are good, but the highlights for me are: Dancing with the moonlight knight, Firth of fifth, and the Battle of Epping Forest.
B00008DDSA|5.0|Hit Play and watch it Burn. This movie takes lust to a whole new plateau and we gladly leap off the cliff with these characters. All past screen kisses and hugs wane weak in the face of this little indie flick, including Rhett Butler's carriage of Scarlet up that grand staircase. Spader's reserved performance reeks of kinky sexual need held in check only by surpreme inner conflict at war with his flesh whether to  commit such lewd acts against another human being. While Gyllenhall's portrayal of a socially stunted and life needy  girl-woman makes the viewer love her and comprehend here's a lost soul putting hot pots against her skin to 'feel': so a little S & M pain is good for her. Each character an 'oddball'; together a 'fireball'. I've played this one over and over and have enjoyed each showing; catching new things with each spin. Like Gyllenhall's rain cape respresenting Little Red Riding Hood's cloak of innocence and Spader's melting-in-place when his submissive so much as strokes his hair revealing how the dominant is the true captive. Buy it, watch it, you won't regret it. I promise. JDB - movie taster
B0007XT87G|5.0|Nearly every superlative that can be uttered about an album has been uttered about Deadwing, so I won't natter on with a song-by song rehash of how great this CD is. But I will lend my voice to Porcupine Tree's growing amen corner. In the last few years, the band has produced a string of consistently magnificent recordings and Deadwing only emphasizes PT's continuing commitment to quality.  While Deadwing is far from commercial, its success signals that a commercial breakthrough for Porcupine Tree should be imminent. Given that previously hard to find past recordings are being remastered and reissued, perhaps that breakthrough has already occurred.  Though I like the entire CD, I have my favorites of course. These are the title cut, Halo (what a song!), Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here), Open Car, and the unnamed and unlisted bonus tune that plays following a long interlude at the end of the CD.  I listen to a lot of different types of music, but being introduced to the music of Porcupine Tree when In Absentia was issued opened up a whole new musical world for me. Since that time, I have either heard or acquired most of the band's back catalogue and have come to the opinion that these guys are on their way to becoming one of the greatest groups of the decade. Get this today, and you'll see what I mean!  By the way, the reviewer who likes the music but thinks the name is stupid should find out what a porcupine tree is. Having lived in places where there are porcupines, I know that such trees exist everywhere there are porcupines.
B00005MP58|4.0|I truly enjoyed this movie, and since watching it, have more than once referred to it as \\"Excellent!\\"  However, I am only giving it 4 stars rather than 5 because I was not QUITE as captivated by it as some other reviewers seem to have been. Indeed, it's well worth viewing, and I will certainly watch it again (and again, and again), but I've seen other period pieces that I (personally) enjoy just THAT much more, and THOSE films I truly believe deserve a full 5 stars (and perhaps more). They include \\"Berkely Square\\" and Edith Wharton's \\"The Buccaneers\\".  That said, I have NO regrets by adding Pride and Prejudice to my collection, and if you enjoy period pieces, then I can't imagine you would regret purchasing this DVD either!
0060989157|5.0|Nothing like your usual boring biography!  This book is pure entertainment!  Tales of debauchery, mariages and mismariages, see the rises and falls of Motley Crue.  All that spiced with a lot of booze, a lot of drugs, and more importantly, a lot of chicks!  And the most interesting point is that you see the view of all the Crue members and some members of their entourage.<br /><br />A must-read for every rock and roll fans!
B000850IHW|5.0|This is my favorite Gentle Giant album, and probably one of my favorite albums period. If you aren't familiar with Gentle Giant, they are a progressive rock band from the 70's. I really can't compare them to any other band, because there is no one else like them. Its just great music.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|great picture this dvd was great ,have been hopeing for it to come on dvd and it did,see for yourself what one man could do to a nation so beware of our world.
B000002IHD|5.0|You would think that this album is one of the many compilations of the greatest Otis Redding songs. But it isn't! It's an actual album, maybe still released as a collection of singles but definitely great. <br /> <br />You won't hear a lot of the great Redding/Cropper compositions because there are only three. <br /> <br />It starts with one of the best Redding openings. The choppy, on first hearing not to good, intro of 'Ole Man Trouble'. But you will never forget it. <br /> <br />Song 2 has been made more famous by Aretha Franklin, but Otis' rendition of his own 'Respect' has a different meant and a great horn part in the pumping intro followed by Donald Dunn's great bassline. <br /> <br />There are three Sam Cooke songs on this album, the first being the anthem 'A Change is Gonna Come'. As a great Sam Cooke fan I have to admit that Otis gives such a gutwrenching all out performance that is rivals Cooke's version. <br /> <br />'Down in the Valley' has a great bass/piano beat, it may not be the best song on the album, but it's still very good. <br /> <br />Track 5 is an Otis standard, the great 'I've been loving you too long', one of his best vocal/ballad performances. <br /> <br />Another Cooke song is 'Shake' recorded a lot wilder than Cooke did. This may actually be closer to what Cooke intended but he was of course bound by record label rules. If he had put this on his 'live at the harlem square club' album it would probably have sounded like this. <br /> <br />'My Girl' is a song that everybody will know and the same goes for Cooke's 'Wonderful World' which is one of the best covers of this song.  <br /> <br />'Rock Me Baby' is one the bluesiest songs Otis ever recorded and it rivals the BB King Original, helped by the rumbling bass beat. <br /> <br />Otis gives a great and original version of the Stones' 'Satisfaction'. It's the horns that make the song. <br /> <br />The slower 'You Don't Miss Your Water' ends the album. An 11 song sample of Otis' many talents is over. <br /> <br />Great album
B00000BKDY|5.0|My first and favourite Maiden album. Fantastic production, inspiring  and emotional  Adrian Smith's guitar playing and some progressive elements. No weak songs on this one. Somewhere in Time was ahead of it's time and is actually still ahead of our time.
B000001ELF|5.0|Ace made a comment (circa 1993) in which he said, \\"when I left [KISS], they got a musical vasectomy\\", and this release backs up that argument.  For better or for worse, the success of this record essentially ended his first tenure in the band, and launched his solo career.<br /><br />\\"Fractured Mirror\\" is the most underrated rock instrumental of the last several decades, and the rest of the album is one blistering cut after another, with lots of help from some of the musicians who would eventually form The World's Most Dangerous Band (of David Letterman fame).<br /><br />The best thing I could say about Ace's solo record is that if I weren't already a huge KISS mark, I'd still own it.  While each of the solo records have their strong points, Ace's is the only must-own of the four.
B00004RIVF|5.0|(WOW),this is an awesome thrash album,when I first heard this album I was blown away.Heathen is cheesy but who cares there music rules.Goblins Blade is the best song on the album, <br />Death By Hanging,Breaking The Silence,Worlds End and all the rest of the song's rule on this album,the only song I don't like is the cover song Set Me Free.If you like thrash and you never heard of Heathen or don't have this album,buy it.Oh yeah,the solo's on this album are amazing.

B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee Olstead is my new favorite singer! I hope she releases more music.  I first heard about her on a PBS special and had to buy the CD!
B00095MLGC|4.0|One more excellent CD from PT, not so good as IN ABSENTIA, but this double catched me again. The disc 2 has the beuatiful song The Joke's on You, in a SW voice. The other 4 are instrumentals, being three wonderful. <br />Disc 1 has, besides the fantastic Fadeaway, other 9 songs. <br />
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Warner is without a doubt, the finest home video label in the industry. No doubt about it. Not even the commendable, but ultimately conventional Criterion label comes close. <br /> <br />So now, 8 years into DVD-dom, WB is finally giving us KING KONG. One of the greatest motion pictures ever made. One of the most popular. One of the most successful.  <br /> <br />So why hasn't it been on DVD all this time? <br /> <br />Because Warner wanted to do it right. <br /> <br />Warner owns the RKO library (although the previous owner, General Tire (no I'm not kidding) sold of foreign rights for several years in various countries for various periods of time) and although the foreign labels that have rights to these films quickly released them, Warner didn't.  <br /> <br />They knew the RKO library was in terrible shape, and with their near-perfect record of perfection on every release, they sought to find the best original film negatives and create the best extra material. <br /> <br />Many RKO films have finally started to be available from Warner over the last two or three years. In every instance, the Warner RKO DVDs have been heads-and-tails better than those released by the international companies who hold rights in their respective countries. I say this only because I've seen comparisons online between what WB has dome, and what was out previously overseas. <br /> <br />Looking at WB's track record, we can expect a magnificent Kong transfer, the 8th wonder of the world! But there is more, this \\"collector's tin\\" comes with something I have always dreamed of seeing, but never have. A reproduction of the lavish opening night souvenir program from the premiere at Grauman's Chinese back in 1933. I read about it and the cover was reproduced in Ronald Haver's great book about David O. Selznick. <br />Also, the tim comes with postcard sized renderings of original Kong posters, and best of all, you get a mail-in card that gets you a true theatrical-sized (27x41) reproduction ofone of the original 1933 posters. Yes, these are reproductions, but considering the original Kong poster goes for I think 100K, an authorized, full-sized repro will look cool in my house. <br /> <br />I am also excited to see the special features I've heard about. Apparently, Peter Jackson (who has remade KONG for release at Xmas) is the original's biggest fan, and contributed to the special features. In addition, Kong's creator, Merian C. Cooper, is also given his own documentary here, and although he may not be a household name(by a longshot!), this guy not only created KING KONG, but also collaborated with John Ford on some of the greatest films ever made, and then went on to be the chief architect of Cinerama. The Cooper documentary has been made (so I've read online) by none other than Kevin Brownlow, who is, without question, the finest cinema documentarian of all time. <br /> <br />The wait is over. Now we just count the days. This tin is mine! <br /> <br />I'll also be buying the other related Cooper movies like LAST DAYS OF POMPEII, THE SON OF KONG, and the original MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (with a tounge in cheek, and a very beautiful Terry Moore). <br /> <br />So the ultimate question is, what will be the greatest DVD classic of 2005. This seemingly magnificent uber-KONG from Warner, or the new Ultra-Resoltion 3 Disc mega set on WIZARD OF OZ. Likely it will be a tie. Admittedly, I'm a huge fan of Warner. 3 years ago, there were very few Warner DVDs on my shelf, as they seemed to ignore their library. Since then, it's been Xmas almost every month.  Those folks sure do a great job, and I'm sure their KING KONG, in that irresistable tin, will be worth the wait. <br /> <br />
B0002EXH54|5.0|All of Megadeth's albums are original but Peace Sells... is the most original album in my opinion.Wake Up Dead,freakin' awesome song!Peace Sells rules the album,the lyrics on that song are awesome,all the lyrics rule but Peace Sells is the best,here are the lyrics from the first verse but I'm sure everyone knows them anyway but this is for the people who don't. <br />What do you mean,\\"I don't believe god\\"? <br />I talk to him everyday, <br />What do you mean,\\"I don't support your system\\"? <br />I go to court when I have to, <br />What do you mean,\\"I can't get to work on time\\"? <br />I got nothing better to do, <br />And,what do you mean,\\"I don't pay my bill's\\"? <br />Why do you think I'm broke?Huh? <br />Those lyrics rule!I Ain't Superstitious is a cover song(funny).Black Friday rules,read the lyrics to that song,I'll give you an example. <br />Killer,Intruder,Homicidal man. <br />If you see me coming,run fast as you can. <br />A blood thirsty demon who's stalking the street <br />I hack up my victims like pieces of meat. <br />Of course the playing on this album rules,the riffs(amazing).You won't go wrong,buy this album.
B0001I562I|4.0|My fairly sophistcated almost 15-yr-old loved this movie.  I was pleased because even though I remembered it being a good story, I was concerned that the level of technology used in the film would appear very dated.  It did not.  My 22-yr-old watched it with his sister, reminiscing that he would play this over and over when he was much younger.  I would recommend this as a good family film.
B00005A46T|5.0|I miss this Slipknot so much now after the release of the terribly weak Vol. 3.  Iowa redifined metal to an extreme untouched by anyone else.  It was this CD that made me absolutely obsessed with Slipknot.  And it was Vol. 3 that killed that obsession... damn, I miss this Slipknot.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Mariah Carey has done it again.  What an amazing CD.  I never thought there was any doubt that this CD would shoot to Number 1 on the charts!  Every song is sweet and cool.  I don't feel that she really used her voice the way she has in the past.  Maybe she is trying to move away from that signature high note and focus more on great soulful music that fills your heart and makes you want to repeat the CD over and over again.  The big deal right now seems to be that Mariah Carey is back on top (like she was in the 90's) but maybe nobody remembers that \\"Charmbracelet (2002) hit #2 on the charts.  That isn't bad for America's Sweetheart.  The butterfly continues to fly on this CD and I can't imagine Mariah Carey going anywhere anytime soon.  Please don't welcome her back; she never left!!!
B00005JN5X|3.0|This movie was a movie I had seen limited previews for so I was going into blindly which tends to work well for most movies.  However, this movie was lacking passion and power.  The effects were cool but the plot was just blah.  Personally, I would hold off on watching this movie until video or find it when it hits your cheap theater as it is not worth $7.  Two much was going on that was taking away from the movie that could have been.  Go to one of the other movies out right now such as 40 Year Old Virgin or Must Love Dogs.
0312330529|5.0|This book was so moving that is transcended the reader into Bombay and the lives of the characters.  The book made you laugh out loud, cry and love along with the characters.  I selected this book for my book club and everyone loved it.  This is one of the best books I have ever read.
B00005JN5X|2.0|Van Helsing had a basic plot, good action and great special effects it succeeded where this movie failed by being more straight forward and having much better action sequences.  The movie The Legend of Sleepy Hollow also similar to this one but much better in that the action and plot were tighter and made more sense.<br /><br />Perhaps that's one of the complaints I have about this flick, too much effort to be tricky and with the resulting confusion, one is left always trying to figure out what in the world is going on.  Who's this French general ordering the Grimm brothers around and why does he care if simple villagers believe in witches and spells?  Why does the movie start off trying to give the impression that supernatural stuff doesn't happen but then take us to an enchanted forest?  In Van Helsing we are shown right away that there are supernatural beings, and our hero is going to try and stop them.  In The Legend of Sleepy Hollow we aren't sure if the supernatural is real or not, and that's part of the suspense, but here we're lead to believe that the story will take place in a reality without the supernatural and when it shows up, we're still trying to figure out if it's a hoax or not.  Confusion doesn't lend itself well to making a movie an enjoyable and entertaining event.<br /><br />It's not that the acting was bad, it just didn't click.  Recall the flick Pirates of the Caribbean  Curse of the Black Pearl?, complete with love, betrayal, pirates, spells, evil, good, ghosts, great action, humor?  Well this movie wasn't anything like that.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|A lot of reviewers are claiming that Team America gives it to both ends of the political spectrum. But despite a few jabs at \\"country music patriotism\\" and \\"Top Gun\\" style rah-rah films, the film's main political statement is one that Rush Limbaugh would take to heart: that opinionated entertainers on the left are a bigger problem than corrupt (or just plain stupid) politicians on the right. A pretty naive viewpoint (and I assume that Trey Parker and Matt Stone have some lame justification for their own status as opinionated entertainers). <br /> <br />That said, however, TA is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, and a remarkable technical accomplishment, right from the brilliant opening shot. Some have given one-star reviews due to the right-wing political message. I just want to add that if you can keep your sense of humor, there's lots to laugh at here, even if you aren't down with Parker and Stone's simple-minded politics: The songs that parody big-budget Hollywood films, the infamous \\"puppet sex\\" scene (as hilarious as you've heard, especially the \\"unrated\\" version), the brilliant speech to the UN at the end (can't even describe the subject matter). I'm guessing that most people will laugh even if they take offense to some of it.
020530902X|5.0|The language we use is a window to our soul and intellect.<br /><br />Language  plays an important role in relations with other people and can influence our professional career.<br /><br />The Elements of Style by Strunk is a small classic book that can help us to use English better,when we speak or write.<br /><br />This book is a jewel . You can carry it with you and read bit by bit whenever you have several minutes for making yourself more effective speaker or writer.<br /><br />It has been appreciated for many decades by writers as well as people who wanted to make their English better.
0316172324|2.0|Much like The Tipping Point, Gladwell does well as a cocktail guest relating interesting stories and anecdotes. Many of these are insightful and fun, but altogether, they do not serve to back up any points layed out in the beginning of the book. Worse yet, several examples/chapters contradict the points made in others. For example, he states that there is great power in 'thin slicing', and that it can serve to come to logical conclusions automatically without thinking, then demonstrates how police officers mistakenly gun down innocent people because of the same process. <br /> <br />He says that thin slicing should be done without prejudice, like the symphony auditions conducted behind a sheet for anonymity... but his early favorite example of thin slicing is of art experts who 'instantly' knew a statue was a fake, but they only knew this in the context of a gathering to determine authenticity, so suspicion was already in the air. Then he sites a musician who is only appreciated for his 'true' genius when listened to in the right context of praise by trusted reviewers/musicians... effectively requireing prejudice. <br /> <br />The book then dives into a study on sensation transferrence, which would imply that genuine 'thin slicing' of telling whether food, products, or people would be impossible for anyone but a person specifically trained or genetically predispositioned for the task at hand. <br /> <br />I'm almost afraid to think what people might try to take away from the book. If you dig deep into it, he's saying that if you are trained extensively for years on some specialized thing, that your brain can automatically pick up on the few key things to classify a situation one way or another. This is not thinking without thinking... this is thinking backed by exhaustive and comprehensive training. The person who knew with 95% accuracy when a tennis player would double-fault was a tennis coach who spent his life analyzing the scenarios. The book jacket seems to imply that people can just trust their first snap judgements about anything.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|1990 WAS A GREAT YEAR FOR THE THRASH METAL SCENE! THIS IS A MUST ALBUM FOR YOUR THRASH METAL LIBRARY. I LIVED FOR ALBUMS LIKE THIS ONE.

MEGADETHS RUST IN PEACE IS THAT KIND OF ALBUM. \\"CHECK SOME OF MY REVIEWS ABOUT PARTYING WITH METAL\\" YOU LISTEN TO THIS AND IT WANTS TO BRING YOU IN THE PIT WITH ALL YOUR BUDS. I WAS WITH A FRIEND, AND WE WERE DRIVING TO THE TWIN CITIES TO GO AND SEE A DEATH / PESTILENCE CONCERT. THIS WAS THE ALBUM THAT HIT THE PLAYER IN MY FRIENDS CAR.

B000957O82|4.0|I am hard to please when it comes to comedies, but this movie shines with me! 3 words, Funny, Funny, FUNNY! This was a very cute, lighthearted movie. Will S. plays a different role as the romantic & it was a good role for him. Everyone delivered solid performances in this movie! There were NO forced jokes, everything was genuinely funny! Funny, cute, lighthearted, and entertaining. \\"Hitch\\" has proved to be a very good date movie! This is a MUST buy !
B00005JNTX|1.0|Although the photographic style shows originality, some of the violent scenes were fun, and the actors did a good job, the story is boring.  By the time the movie was almost over, I was waiting for relief from watching this stinker.  When it was over, the only satisfaction came from not having paid movie theater prices for the entire family.

0425152251|5.0|This book is truly a beginner's guide to philosophy. There is little or no story in this book but it would probably not sell if it were titled 'Summary of world philosophy.'The author seems more comfortable with some philosophers than others, thus the uneven distribution of content between philosophers. I did however enjoy the summary and simple writing style.
B00068NVI4|4.0|This is a great DVD of a great concert.  I would really give it 4.5 out of 5 stars if I could ... because of the acoustic set. I don't like accoustic sets.

0316172324|3.0|The first half of the book was an interesting read. The main idea and the meat of the book is unique and thought provoking. The latter half of the book felt like the author was trying to hit a word limit as it got redundant. He sold me his ideas in this first half of the book and lost me in the second half.
B00006JDS4|1.0|This movie is just fake snuff. Thats it. Its boring, laughable, and not scary or disturbing in the least. Watch Last House on the Left, now thats scary!!
1594200106|5.0|Be advised:  this novel has a point of no return beyond which you may find it impossible to put it down.  I was lucky enough to have passed it in late afternoon and finished it at 1:00 AM--though still unable to sleep.  Some books are worth the loss of a night's sleep.  \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is certainly one.  The whirl of intriguing clues, of dark digressions into Franco's Spain and the neighborhoods of Barcelona, the flashbacks and subplots gathered in the final third of the book into a driving narrative with an urgent momentum which left me oblivious to all distractions of family, time, & bodily needs.  I won't recount the plot for you.  Other Amazon reviewers have done a better job than I could do.  I do want to convey my sense of discovery.  Early on I was reminded of the Russian publisher was given the manuscript of \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\".  After a few pages he stopped and put on his tuxedo before continuing.  I felt that way long before I passed the point of no return.  I've certainly read some wonderful novels, even lots of bad ones that kept me mechanically turning the pages even after I'd written them off.  But I can't recall a work of fiction whose ending left me feeling so exhausted, so awestruck and utterly satisfied.  This novel has vivid characters that breathe into your collar, passions that smolder, sear and sour.  It has an inner genius and a full-bodied soul that will require more than a single reading to fully appreciate.  I see there are Amazon listings for three more untranslated novels by Carlos Ruiz Zafon, \\"Marina\\" and \\"El Palacio de la Medianochel\\" [\\"Medianoche\\" perhaps?], and \\"Las Luces de Septiembre\\".  I surely hope Lucia Graves is busy translating them.
B000274THQ|5.0|Alex's mother has a heart attack and collapses when she sees him arrested during a protest again the Berlin Wall.  She falls into a coma for eight months, sleeping through the fall of socialism and the Berlin Wall, the change in governments, and the rapid social and economic modernization.  When she awakes, the doctor tells the family that she can't be excited.  An ardent socialist who gave her life to promoting the East German government, the shock of the new order would be too much for her.  So Alex leads an effort to recreate socialist East Germany for her, to lead her to believe that nothing has changed.   <br /> <br />The inherent difficulty of preserving the past among a rapidly changing present provides comedy throughout.  But the film also seriously portrays the wrenching changes East German society went through as they tried to integrate with the West.  An excellent portrayal of one's family's earnest but flawed adaptation to a new order.  In German with English subtitles. <br />
B000055Y0X|5.0|I've seen this black and white movie many times and never tire of it.  It's a flawless example of movie making.  The acting, plot, pacing, soundtrack and cinematography are perfect, something I can't say about any other movie.       Strangelove is a mid-60s dark comedy about the bomb and mutual assured destruction that drips with irony.  Until you see it, it's impossible to imagine how nuclear annihilation can be laugh-out-loud funny.  Peter Sellers is brilliant in all three roles.  George C. Scott (best line above) is absolutely hilarious.  President Merkin Muffley, Gen. Jack D. Ripper, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, Gen. Buck Turgidson, USSR Ambassator Sadesky, Maj. Kong.  Superb.
B0006399FS|1.0|Do people truly listen to this and like it?  I thought it was the most wretched CD I have ever heard!  Where are the blast beats?  Where are the lightning fast guitar solos?  Where are the interludes?  I think the band members must be on heroin or something.  Whoever allowed this mess to get into stores should be killed.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Listen, I've been a drummer for about 5 years now. And not to sound cocky, but I'm pretty damn good. And I can tell by listening to other drummers if they are good or not. Yes, Meg White's drumbeats are not hard one bit. They are probably the easiest drumbeats ever caught on tape. But that does not mean they are bad. They fit these songs perfectly. Jack has said it himself; if she was trying to be a hotshot drummer like most other drummers, it would not work. She blends perfectly. So shut the hell up, Meg bashers. <br /> <br />Now that I got my little rant out, I can now say that this is one of my favorite albums of all time. I never get sick of this album. I can rock out to this any time I want; in the car, at a party, in my room, etc. This music is completely infectious. From the opening guitar in \\"Seven Nation Army\\" to the rather amusing ending to \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another,\\" I feel hypnotized (no tie-in intended). <br /> <br />Jack White, whether you want to admit it or not, is an amazing guitarist. The things this guy can do never fail to astound me. He has some solos on this disc that are almost Hendrix-worthy. His vocals are also incredibly powerful. He isn't the greatest singer in the world, and he doesn't need to be. Like Meg's drumming, his voice fits this music perfectly. Let's go through the songs, shall we? <br /> <br />\\"Seven Nation Army\\" - The perfect opening to this album. A very hypnotic guitar part and some great lyrics. Meg's drums sound incredibly powerful in this one. I personally think it was worth the radio play that it got. <br /> <br />\\"Black Math\\" - One of the hardest rockin' songs on this album. The vocals are stinging, and the slight tempo change in the middle is really cool. This is even better when played live. <br /> <br />\\"There's No Home For You Here\\" - Whenever someone asks me what my favorite song on this album is, I always have an argument with myself between 3 or 4 songs, and this is one of them. The harmonies between Jack and...Jack are great. They almost sound like Beatles harmonies. His guitar is rarely more powerful. Just a completely kick-ass song. <br /> <br />\\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" - Another one of my favorite songs. The mellow parts are very good, and the ending is very fitting. Only Jack and Meg can turn a Dusty Springfield song into this. <br /> <br />\\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\" - The most hypnotic song on the album. Meg's vocals totally bring you out of your world and into theirs. They're just so darn mesmerizing. The organ adds a nice touch. <br /> <br />\\"I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart\\" - A very nice song with meaningful lyrics. Guys, don't we all remember the girlfriend's mom we tried to win over? Excellent slide guitar solo in the middle, I might add. <br /> <br />\\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\" - Excellent heartfelt ballad with awesome guitar playing and vocals. The only Stripes song to ever feature only one of them. <br /> <br />\\"Ball and Biscuit\\" - 7 minutes and 23 seconds of pure brilliance. 4 amazing guitar solos that would make Eddie Van Halen drop his jaw. Great bluesy lyrics and solid drumming. Even Bob Dylan was impressed with this song. Enough to bring Jack on stage in one of his concerts to perform it (no joke!). I could listen to this all day. <br /> <br />\\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" - The White Stripes have bass in one of their songs!! Don't worry, they aren't selling out. The bass really adds to the attitude of this song. The absolute best thing are the lyrics. They are so odd, yet they walk on the edge of ingenious. Good job, Jack. <br /> <br />\\"Little Acorns\\" - Yes, the opening is a little weird, but it ties in with the song. The guitar is greatly heavy. <br /> <br />\\"Hypnotize\\" - Jack and Meg made this song short and sweet. It goes by quick, but every second is hypnotizing (once again, no pun intended). <br /> <br />\\"The Air Near My Fingers\\" - Another one of my absolute favorites on this album. The lyrics are very good and the guitar is just plain awesome. I love the rockin' organ as well. <br /> <br />\\"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\\" - Don't let the title turn you off. I can't explain how awesome this song is. It is probably the single hardest rockin' song on the album. The lyrics are sung very fast, but they are brilliant. I could listen to this song all day. <br /> <br />\\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\" - Yes, they probably could have found a better way to close out the album, but this isn't necessarily a bad choice. Some of the lines are pretty funny, and everyone gets in on the fun. <br /> <br />If you couldn't tell by now, I frickin' love this album to death. The White Stripes are brilliant and I can't wait to see them live in September. So don't listen to all the Meg-haters. If you appreciate good music whatsoever, get \\"Elephant.\\" I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00005JMYI|4.0|This funny film tells the story of local celebrity anchorman Ron Burgundy and what happens to him when the all-male network takes on new reporter Veronica Corningstone in an effort to improve diversity.  The characters are convincing and except for some unnecessary fight scenes between the broadcast news networks, the plot was well developed and funny.  A light film, worth watching for some comic relief.
B000001ED1|4.0|Joan Osborne is consistantly overlooked and underrated. I have very little success finding any of her releases anywhere but online.  I admit to having been made aware of her in the beginning by \\"One of Us\\", which I agree is a kind of throwaway little deal; the lyric is unremarkable, and the melody is grating. But the mark of a real artist is to take something rather banal and turn it on its sides and let us see, if not something new, at least something just a little different.  Joan Osborne's voice is arresting--she is a back room, long after-hours, drinkin' straight whiskey and chain-smokin' unfiltered cigarettes kind of woman. There is a juicy, frank sexuality to her, and the rest of this particular CD gives her a chance to wander over to our table, pull up a chair, light another one and toss back a double or two with us.  \\"St. Theresa\\" is a great, driving opener, \\"Man in the Long,Black Coat\\" is kind of a mirror to Jagger and the Chieftains doing \\"Long,Black Veil\\", \\"Right Hand Man\\" and \\"Let's Just Get Naked\\" make me wanna get my freak on. But I think my two personal favorites on this CD are \\"Pensacola\\" and \\"Ladder\\" for the stories in the lyrics.  The former conjures an overcast day and finding someone you've been told wasn't worth looking for, and trying to make sense of that missing piece of your life, and the latter speaks to me about wanting to love someone, and how hard they will sometimes make it(\\"I'm learning your secrets, baby, I'm cracking your little code\\"). Joan delivers every note here with a depth and passion that is the heart of the blues--truths told with ironic humor and resignation to the way men and women will forever be attracted to and rejected by each other. Hey, I'd definately buy her a round or two and let her bum a smoke!
B000067J1Q|2.0|Robert Wise's \\"Sound of Music\\" was one of the biggest successes among the movies that are musicals. It has a decent cast, positive outlook and an appealing story that is black and white. Julie Andrews plays the part of a nun who becomes the governess for the children of a captain in Salzburg and is very good in her role. The movie was filmed in Salzburg and has beautiful photography. The screenplay was by Ernest Lehmann and traces their escape from the Nazis. The movie has a lot of beautiful songs. There is some decent acting by people who play the part of Max Dettweiler and the Eleanor Parker, who plays the Baroness.  A lot of the story is predictable though and too simple. The interaction between Julie Andrews and the children can be boring after a point, the dialogs especially.  <br />Kurt: \\"What is incorrigible?\\" <br />Maria: \\"I think it means that you want to be treated like a boy.\\" <br />I do not know who came up with that, but any person with minimum intelligence will get tired of such screenplay. <br /> <br />There is not enough realism in the movie. The story makes Austria as the wounded country by the Nazis. One portion in the movie where they talk about Austrian pride and show it when they sign the song \\"Edelweiss\\" in public is all fictional. Though the government was against the Nazis, the people were not. In reality, they welcomed them and except for a small number of people, were easily absorbed into the Third Reich. Every where that the Nazi leaders went, they were welcomed by large crowds and now it is there in the web for public. In fact, Austria conveniently used this movie and its theme for years to act the guilty party. However, Austria's role in the Holocaust has been coming out of late with different confessions and it has not been easy. Even now, there is a lot of anti-semitism in Austria, perhaps more than most countries in Europe. They also make the escape from Austria to be too easy. In reality, it was extremely difficult. One has to look into the story of Paul Grueninger, who was the police chief of Saint Gallen canton in Switzerland. It was very hard for people to get an exit visa from Austria via Switzerland.  <br /> <br />Despite all this, people who love music can listen to the sound track for several reasons. It is the last one by Oscar Hammerstein and is beautifully written. It is one of the few movies that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, though I know people who are tired of it. It came out the same year as a number of great movies and yet had great success in the box office. It has Julie Andrews at her best with great outlook for the whole family, wonderful photography and Christopher Plummer doing a good job as a stern father. Though it is a great musical, it needs more imagination in its story and screenplay.  For people who wish to collect the movie, a 40th anniversary edition of the movie is to be released in a couple of months with a great digital transfer.
068987474X|1.0|This book purports the easy way out, quitting.  If you take the author's advice you will fall into the `self help book quandary.'  That being you will find an excuse NOT to when you need to find a reason WHY NOT.  Forever you will find reasons and rationalizations.  I bet, if you are old enough, the rules didn't work either.  Neither will this!   <br /> <br />As a guy, I say that I don't agree with this book.  In a world where men's traditional role in society is under attack (not a bad thing) and women are gaining power and influence in society, men are having self esteem issues.  Not every man is Mr. Big, we don't all know we can `get' whatever we want.  Thus when a man is not coming after you 110% it MAY just be that he is not 110% sure in himself.  It used to be that men would be chasing women however, in a brave new world, women need to chase men a little more.  Give us a nudge and we will go a mile with you.    <br />

0062502182|5.0|This is one of the best Book by Paulo Coelho, I enjoyed the book and I have learned so much from it. If you want to change the way you leave to the best read this book, it teaches us to believe in ourselves in order to succeed in life, that there is no need to go somewhere to know what to do all we need to do is believe in ourselves and accept the change, and beleive in our dreams. as dreams can come true as long as we believe and act on them.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|It can be argued the Tim Burton's artistic direction of Batman and Batman Returns could never be duplicated. But the good news is director Christopher Nolan does not try to remake any past incarnation of the Batman character, he creates anew. Being the director of films imbued with dark characters (Following, Momento, Insomnia) Nolan is the perfect choice to take on the Dark Knight. And for those who didn't know the name Christian Bale before his turn here as the young Bruce Wayne/Batman, will certainly be taking notice now. Batman Begins is truly a new start for the Batman franchise. It may have too much story and too little superhero action for some viewers, but the fact is: this film could not have been done much better.
B000A7S4B0|5.0|How can any brmc fan not love this album?!? The songs are pure brmc. It might take a few listens to hear it, but it's worth the effort. Try it in headphones. Reminds me a lot more of Love & Rockets than their previous releases. And that's a good thing, IMO.    These albums don't come along often. And when they do, make sure you relish that sensation of hearing a classic for the first time.
0887307280|4.0|A great, easy to read book with powerful principles told in an acessible manner.  Sometimes it was like Michael Gerber had been watching me at work and written the story of my Business - scary.  A must read for those struggling with developing a small to medium sized business.
0446608955|5.0|This was the first book I have read by Nicholas Sparks and i LOVED it! It is such a moving love story. It's a story about a young man who falls for the shy daughter of the minister at his local church. Their relationship has enough hurdles to overcome, the fact that he is the popular guy at school and she is considered a nerd for one, but when she reveals her secret, he is left shocked, angry and worst of all, heartbroken. This is the type of relationship many only dream of, and will never have. It is a great novel, a brilliant effort from Sparks. i would thoroughly recommend this book to anyone.
B000002UAU|5.0|First off, The Beatles did NOT copy Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, because Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was released in 1967 and Dark Side of the Moon was released in 1973. People should verify their facts before making such daring statements as \\"The Beatles are a rip-off from Pink Floyd!\\" & \\"The Stones are so much more!\\". Since when is it wrong to love them all? And since when has such a successful band as The Beatles been considered terrible? Opinions are wonderful and should be expressed, but unless one does not have a good reason for saying The Beatles are overrated or  awful, one should hold his or her tongue.    The truth is, The Beatles changed music history. Sgt. Peppers is arguably the single most influencal album of all time. Of course other artists had musical influence, but overall, The Beatles ruled the sixties along with The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones, etc. With unforgettable songs such as Day in the Life, Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds and When I'm Sixty-Four, Sgt. Pepper's doesn't fail to amaze.    The notion of an album as a unit was introduced before Sgt. Pepper's (notably with Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys), but there's that uniqueness and strangeness that defines Sgt. Pepper's as a quirky Beatles gem.    There is no one definite best Beatles album and that's what's so great about them. They don't have FEW GREAT songs or MANY GOOD songs. They have MANY GREAT songs and MANY GREAT albums. All their albums and all their songs are worth a listen even if they're entitled \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" or \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\".
B0007Y08QA|2.0|Bale must have lost his mind! (no, not completely: he signed for Batman, and that is a very CLEVER movement...). He lost so much wight for a movie that did not deserve it. Useless piece of filmmaking...
B00005JN5X|1.0|What a waste of time!  No story line, no plot, no character development.  And the ending looks more like festivities at a Bar Mitzvah with everyone dancing the Hora than a 18th century Germany villiage celebration.  Guck!
B0006L5RT2|5.0|What a fantastic album. For me, the standout track is \\"Goodbye my Lover\\". It brings a tear to my eye with the sheer emotion of his voice and his lyrics. <br /> <br />Of course, \\"You're Beautiful\\" is just that, a beautiful song. I have to admire the intensity he brings to every song and I highly, highly recommend this album to everyone. He is just outstanding!
076113719X|5.0|We've had one of these calendars for the last 4 or 5 years now and we couldn't live without it!!  There's a space for everyone's name and their activities for each day.  No more trying to cram everyone's activities into one little square!  Now everyone has their own square!  I love the art work and have been a fan of Sandra Boynton for a long time.  She is so clever and it's a pleasure to hang this on my refrigerator.

B0006J28BO|5.0|How can I explain the special place that Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli movies have in my heart? The Cat Returns is no exception. Although not directed by Miyazaki, it retains the heart of what makes every Studio Ghibli movie great. This project was actually created in order to raise up the next generation of Ghibli directors. And I say that if this is the first work of Hiroyuki Morita, I can't wait to see how his later works look like. <br /> <br />The story is less epic in scale than Spirited Away although both feature female girls being transported to a strange place. Here, Haru, our high school girl protagonist, is spirited away to Cat Kingdom in order to be married to the cat prince whom she saves at the beginning of the film. I think the greatest compliment for the movie is that it's a lot of fun. It's a light-hearted romp in which you continually see marvelous things. You never know what to expect and it's always creative from riding on a carpet of cats to seeing cats walks on their hind legs and talk. It's a sense of amazement on a lighter scale, that makes you go \\"what the?\\" but in a good way. I first felt that the movie might have been too light, but repeated viewings actually enhance the movie's likeability. <br /> <br />A lot of the movie's charm has to do with the characters involved. There's Haru, an extremely likeable and regular girl, whose outbursts can be funny. There's also the dapper Baron in his suit, tophat and cane along with his pals, the abrasive and tough Muta, and their friend who's a crow. And there's the greasy Cat King and his obsequious servants. All in all, it creates a world you'd like to visit. <br /> <br />Although there is conflict in the movie, there is no sense of real threat, but it works that way. It's one lively exciting adventure from the chase scenes, the waltz, the beautiful walk down spiraling birds--a most whimsical tail (*wink*). But what grounds the movie also is that at heart, it's the story of growing up. What Haruexperiences changes her, makes her grow and expand, allows her find confidence, courage, and find herself. <br /> <br />The English Dub version is really good. They really kept to the spirit of the characters. Haru is voiced by Anne Hathaway (of The Princess Diaries fame) who captures the essence of a young girl perfectly. And the Baron is voiced by Cary Elwes (Princess Bride) who is able to get the aristocratic tone of the Baron across.  <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I actually have the new dualdisc version with the dvd footage. My absolute favorite song this year and possibly ever is Ordinary People. John has such a soulful, raw voice and with just him and his piano and the honest, emotional lyrics, this song is genius. I can listen to it all the time and never tire of it. I also love \\"used to love u\\", \\"let's get lifted\\", \\"so high\\", \\"number one\\" and \\"stay with you.\\" I recommend the dual disc because you get to meet John and his family and see live concert footage and behind the scenes on his videos. He should win the grammy for best new artist, best male artist, best recording for Ordinary people, and best album.
630512762X|4.0|Two of these actors Nic Cage and John Travolta really knock it out of the park on this film. For me I'd say Cage dominated in terms of really bringing over the fact of being trapped within another man's face and life, and being that of a person you hate it was quite the performance. One highlight is of the meeting in the prison of the two when all hell breaks loose for Cage's character when he realises his nemesis has the upper hand. Fun ride from beginning to end with the right injection of emotion. This is truly a blockbuster action movie by all merits.
B00092ZMDY|1.0|I caught part of this on NBC the other night - that was more than enough for me. <br />I always liked the Eagles as well as the solo work of Don Henley & Joe Walsh - they have great songs & were one of the first & best alt-country/ rock bands back in the day. <br />But, as I tried to watch this performance, I couldn't help feeling as if everything was just too scripted, too planned, too ..... lame!!!! And what's with the extra guys they added to the band??? I mean, I could see getting another guitarist to replace Don Felder but why did they need another drummer plus a keyboard player plus backup singers plus a horn section??? It somehow reminded me of some nightmarish version of the Lawrence Welk Show Meets the Eagles circa 2005 . . . and a one-a & a two-a. Smile, boys, smile!!!! <br />It looks to me like these guys are purely in it 110% for the scratchola at this point (not that I blame them as long as they can draw a crowd) - they might as well go set up shop in Las Vegas or Branson, MO & share the bill with Wayne Newton or Dolly Parton. So very sad to see . . . .
B0008G2IRO|5.0|ok this review is from someone who doesn't really like to listen to music. I never like anyone person or group to buy a cd and I now own both Gorillaz CD's and have the dvd on the way. Demon days was excellent. I had to listen to it once or twice before i got used to the unique style but once I was adjusted I couldn't get enough of it. I don't know why people have a problem with White light , I think it's fun and Fire coming out of a monkey's head is an excellent twist on folk lore. The whole cd is one solid bash of fun - my only problem with it is that it doesn't have an infinite number of songs on it. Buy this cd!
0446677450|5.0|If you are serious about getting out of the rate race, then I highly recommend this book. The author explains the differences between how the rich and middle class think and shows why middle class thinking only gets them deeper in debt and a lifetime of hardships.<br /><br /> From this book, I have learned that one can appear to be very prosperous yet still be poor, living paycheck to paycheck just hoping they never lose thier job.  The author explains that it is not what you make, the car you drive or what kind of house you own. The difference he says, is what you keep.<br /><br />This book is a real eye opener and may have many hitting themselves over the head saying \\"DUH! Why have I never realized this before??\\" If I had this book 20 years ago, and followed what what Mr. Kiyosaki has written I would be a multi-millionaire today. Luckily for us all, it is never to late to start!  I thank Mr. Kiyosaki for writing this wonderful book I encourage everyone to not only read it, and follow his advice but also start teaching their children this wisdom as well.
6303477259|5.0|I always wanted to see a Pink Floyd concert but was either living elsewhere or tending to other personal business and missed  out on their concerts when they were in town. Plus the fact theym never really toured much in Canada. Finally, in 1994, I got my chance and purchased awesome tickets from a scalper to see their 2nd concert in Toronto.They played three concerts in Toronto in 1994. I had good a seat up front and the show was spectacular. Some guy came in late, was very intoxicated and seemed to pass out after a couple of songs.Too bad for him. What an awesome show this guy missed. The lighting, lazers, and explosions were something else to experience. I could actually feel the heat from the fire not to mention what felt like the music pulsing right through me with the vibrations making me feel like my eyeglasses were going to shatter. Who could ever forget the pigs in the speakers. The concert was almost three hours long and I enjoyed every minute of it. Needless to say, I purchased tickets (again scalpers)to the third and last concert and took my girlfriend at the time. She was amazed at the the concert Pink Floyd put on and all the visual effects. It was just awesome but wasn't as long as the previous shows. Also, fireworks were happening out in Lake Ontario before the concert started and sound effects were playing which added to the surrealism of the whole scene.  <br />I purchased the video and c.d. and cassette tape when they came out and the video was similar to being at the concert itself. The only disappointment was not having Astronomy Domaine on the video and this is the one song I was hoping they would play in conceret and they did. Floyd actually opened with this number in their Toronto concerts.  <br />It would be nice if Pink Floyd did one more tour in North America. With or without Roger Waters the show would still be great as I certainly didn't miss Roger and the rest of Pink Floyd didn't seem to miss him either. The replcaement guys did a wonderful job and it was nice to get the opportunity to see one of the worlds best bands play. I along with other Pink Floyd fans would dearly love to see one more tour. I am also hoping for the DVD release of Pulse and I do hope that Astronomy Domaine is included this time around. The video et al were nice but the DVD will be sensational.  <br />I saw an advertisement a few years back and the asking price was over$100.00 for a DVD.  <br /> I hope that the price of this official Pulse DVD won't be that costly. I would still purchase the DVD if that were the case as it would be well worth it.
B000929AJQ|5.0|You know, as I skim through the reviews for this album, i grow more and more disgusted. I mean, and I'm not knocking fellow NIN fans, but they just seem like they expect way too much. Just like Trent himself said, \\"the album is what it is\\". I read one review that said that Trent isn't angry anymore, and I agree with that, but that doesn't mean that Nine Inch Nails has lost its fire. I couldn't wait for this album to come out, and I was not at all disappointed. Every track on this album is excellent, so there's really no need in breaking down the tracks and rating them. While fan reaction and feedback does matter alot, I feel that it is really important for the artist to be proud of the music that they deliver. Once again, I'm not knocking the fans, but they should recognize the effort put into this work and not see it as a disappointment just because to them it's not the Nine Inch Nails that they are used to. I highly praise NIN for trying new things in music, giving the fans a new vision. I've been a loyal NIN fan for over 9 years and this album puts a stamp on the fact that I always will be a fan. Excellent album.<br /><br />In closing, I will say that my favorite song on this album easily is Every Day Is Exactly The Same. Lyrically and musically, this song is just simply amazing.
B00005JN5X|1.0|What a waste - a waste of the $8 for the ticket. A waste of the actors, who are much, much better than this material. A waste of the many special effects. A waste of the location and sets.<br /><br />It's not the worst movie ever. But then, I haven't seen every movie.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|It's a pretty good adaptation.  The people are not very attractive, but it's filmed on location in Lyme Regis and Bath.  Stays pretty true to the novel.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Im probely one  of the biggest slayer fans if not the biggest...With that groupie bullsh*t  out of the way? Since slayer has began these guys has always been putting out great cds even their latest stuff still is satanic & evil as well. Slayer's \\" reign in blood\\" is worth the purchase if you dont have it? Kill your self.
B000005ILF|5.0|If you hear \\"I was brought to my senses\\" you will notice Sting sings like a violin. There is no voice on earth that can meet the disarrayed vocals that sting displays on the track. Mercury falling is an album I have been listening to for a few months now. I don't know why I never bothered to hear it before. Like a friend on amazon said, this album does have Sting in a mellower mood than usual. He goes as far as making \\"Im so happy I can't stop crying\\" I can use words but cannot explain just how dreadfully addictive it is.Sting makes fun of his predicament. Just how many men/artists can do this as well as the master himself?<br /><br />The first time I heard I HUNG MY HEAD,it was the johnny cash version. I like the Cash version more but that doesnt take anything away from the original. I find it a difficult exercise to get bored of this album. It seems newer than the last time everytime I hear it. Track 1, Hounds of Winter has an everlasting melody that hits off the album.<br /><br />Some other songs on this album that I love with all my heart,<br /><br />You Still Touch Me(Beautifully set),Let Your Soul (Amazing Amazing Amazing), Lithium Sunset (not great but it's like the credits rolling on this album to end) , All four Seasons, etc.<br /><br />I think I have named all the tracks of this album. My favourite Sting album is Brand New Day because that is what started the addiction for me with monumental songs (Ghost Story,A Thousand Years,Desert Rose,Big Lies small world) Mercury Falling is more intriguing,complex,bigger and all in all more respect earning.<br /><br />I saw Sting perform in my city earlier this year and he didnt perform one song from this album. Great concert though.<br /><br />Buy Mercury Falling if you appreciate albums that complete themselves. You can listen to one track from this album repeatedly and not get bored.You can start from anywhere, there's no pattern as such.<br /><br />With Much Respect,<br /><br />HSA
B0002OERI0|1.0|Music is found in a time period where it is very repetative, band after band following the same setup, and put little to no innovation in their work.  Green Day is one of these bands.  They follow the same setup for their songs as every other pop punk band on the market.  It's already been done.  People do not listen to the quality of music anymore and rather base the music that they listen to on what the industry puts out for them.  We are caught in a world where music is not appreciated anymore, where sameness and blandness are embraced and the artistic value of a person is crushed. When something innovative is put on the market, no one listens to it.  Green Day is just a fad, will not be known in about ten years and will probably try to stay on top, but will come crashing down, more and more with every album that they put out.  Compared to such greats as The Ramones and the Clash, Green Day, at least with the American Idiot cd, give punk a bad name.  most people will probably not agree with it, because they are the fad at the moment, but hey......
B00015YVDG|3.0|An enjoyable thriller, which spins a change on the normal kidnapping story. I think Rene Russo and Brawley Nolte had magnificent preformances in this film. However I thought that Mel Gibson at times over acted a bit. I am a fan of Mel Gibson by the way. <br /> <br />Overall though this is an entertaining film that is well worth watching.
B00000JG41|5.0|I have never heard anything like this in my life. I cannot stop listening to this CD, it's THAT great. This CD has totally messed me up, man, I'm so serious about that. I feel absolutely INSANE after hearing this album!<br /><br />(But it's a good kind of insane.)
068987474X|5.0|While this book can be a little black and white, overall it is a good book for women, especially those over thirty, in the dating scene( as dating in your thirties is much more complicated than in your twenties). Some take offense at the idea that a guy is just not into them but what this book is really about is that a women should be treated well and if she isn't getting what she wants from a relationship she should move on. To reviewers who have said that it's common sense etc. I know many great, beautiful, successful, smart women who have put up with a lot of crap and made alot of excuses for men. When you're over thirty and dating in a big city, it's tough and I have seen many of the scenarios in the book played out in real life. Worse ones in fact. It's much easier to see when a friend is being played than when it's you.  If you you watched the piece Oprah did on the book you could see the array of beautiful women who were settling for peanuts. This book isn't saying all guys are bad, it is just saying don't waste your time with a guy who isn't giving you what you want because there's probably a guy out there who will and you deserve it.

B00005V9IL|5.0|For years i have heard and seen bits of it on tv usually late nights and paid little attention to it then it happened... one night i came back late from work, totally flat out and hungry i sat in front of the tv and the abyss was on again, i must have been soo tired i didn't move but i now believe it was destiny that has glued me to the seat and took me on a journey of discovery and excitement that i can never forget..and i was soo touched watching this film not for one sec i felt detached or bored this really is a MASTERPIECE as only James Cameron can deliever... <br /> <br />I won't say what the story is cos you all either watched it and love it as much as i do... but i find myself soo involved in the movie i felt i was there... the scene when bud swam in freezing cold water to the other station and quietly swam up the dock i was holding my breath all the way and i really felt the water chilled through my bones... the scene when lindsy drown herself i felt tears down my eyes... the scene when the water alien made contact with the crew i felt the excitment in my heart... the scene when lindsy talked to bud on his descend to the abyss i can't help feeling overwhelmed with sadness yet there lies a trace of hope... there are soo many scenes that just move you and brings out your raw emotions and its all from just watching it thats why i think James Cameron is such a great director/story teller... the message in the ending is soo beautiful told that i really wish those aliens exist and is watching over us... <br /> <br />One of my fav film i hope it will be yours too... <br /> <br />5 STARS!!! *****
B0009QTS1M|1.0|I believe that there are serious quality control problems with this new Gladiator Extended Edition based upon my own experience. <br /> <br />I purchased my first copy on the day it was issued 8/23/05 at my local big box electronics store. I was very frustrated to find that there were multiple quality control problems with disc 3. The only feature that it would play was the production design primer. It would not play anything else on the disc. When I tried to go to each new section it would freeze up each time. I tried over a dozen times with no luck.  <br /> <br />I returned the set on 8/28/05 and exchanged the extended edition for another. They claimed they had no other complaints about disc 3 problems.  <br /> <br />Well when I tried to play the new exchanged extended edition disc 3 I was even more frustrated because now no features would play on disc 3. I will be returning this set for a full refund this week. <br /> <br />I've seen other posts on other DVD sites where customers are also having problems with this Gladiator Extended Edition. I just read one where the customer could not get multiple features on disc 1 to play properly and he said he would be returning the set for a refund and stick to watching his two disc DTS version that came out several years ago. <br /> <br />I plan to do the same. What a major disappointment. It is sad that there is so little quality control on a set that costs almost $30.00 most places.  <br /> <br />So buyer beware is my message. I'd be interested to know if other customers had problems with their Gladiator Extended Edition sets as well. <br />                                  Jay <br />                                  Harrisburg,PA

B000089RVR|5.0|Great CD.  Heard DIDO on the radio and ordered her album.  It did not disappoint me.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|I have been watching this show since I was like 10. I grew up with it. I've seen each episode at least 15 times. These seasons are a must have. They are what made the 90's. I don't know one person that did not truly love the show. I converted all my relatives into loving it, and a few friends of my own. A dvd collection should not be without this one. I still find each episode just as funny as the first time I saw it. You can never get sick of them. You won't regret owning these. You'll always having something to make you laugh and cheer you up when you need it most, especially when your own friends aren't around. You'll always have FRIENDS as you friends!!

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I've always found Plant's post-Zeppelin work a little lifeless.  But not this time - lively, surprising, amazingly rich and satisfying music, this is easily his best work in 25 years.  I bought this CD in May and it is STILL the one I listen to more often than any other - if he had 10 more like this one to sell, I'd buy them all tomorrow.   <br /> <br />
B00000IREA|2.0|Well Jane is definately easy on the eyes and the opening scene is nice.  However, there is really no story/plot line and no real purpose to the movie at all.  The special effects are so bad its almost good.  Parts of the movie are worth seeing, overall I wouldn't waste your money.
B000001FAW|5.0|I recieved this item early and it was brand spaking new. The box was not even crushed. This was the first Bee Gees record I bought as a kid and wanted to preserve my memories with buying it with todays technology (CD). It was like stepping back in time. Excellent music that you can enjoy over and over. One of their best albums among so many.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend \\"Children of the World\\" for those who are collecting The Bee Gees music and want to add this to their collection.
B0009KQOME|3.0|While lots of people really like this movie, I do not.  I am also not a Nick Cage fan.  While this movie has its moments (plus Angelina Jolie!) I can't say it is one I ever want to watch again.
B00092ZMDY|1.0|The Eagles is one of the biggest selling artist in the U.S.A. in the middle of 70s. Still I wonder what good is that band. I have nothing good to say. I really hate songs like Hotel California and A New Kid In the Town. Himo Pohonen likes this band!

B000006OAM|5.0|Sumptuous melodies abound, while Natalie's angelic voice and understated piano give this an almost unbearable poignancy. And, despite what critics say, there are certainly variety and texture to these songs. There is no false pathos whatsoever. Still, the tenor of Ophelia is one of undeniable sadness.<br /><br />From the hopeful \\"Kind and Generous\\", to the emotionally harrowing \\"My Skin\\", these songs crystallize the melancholy of the human condition. Accordingly, Ophelia is truly beautiful.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time on AMC a few months back and after I saw it I immediately got on the internet and ordered it.  I love the special effects and set design.  The only real negative to the movie is that the storyline isn't really completed and at a few spots in the movie it almost seems like the makers forgot what was going on or what the movie was about. <br /> <br />If you liked West World, The Omega Man, or Soylent Green you will love Logan's Run as it leaves all of those movies in its dust.  I definately recommend getting this movie and the book.
B0006ZFQP8|5.0|This is a definitive example of the sum being much greater than its parts. I bought this on a whim because I've always loved Kleiber's conducting, and Tristan und Isolde is my favorite opera.<br /><br />Still, I didn't expect that much, mainly because a) when people talk about the ultimate Tristan recording, they NEVER mention this one. We always hear about Furtwangler and Bohm, with Karajan mentioned some, while Solti's attempt has been almost universally panned (not by me, by the way) b) Rene Kollo is an excellent heldentenor, but I was lead to believe (mistakenly) that Tristan was out of his league, and c) who is Margaret Price?<br /><br />Kleiber's Tristan doesn't have the vocal fireworks of Furtwangler, nor the steamy passion of Bohm, but it does possess a cohesiveness that both conductors lack. The Dresden orchestra has a massive sound, but unlike the Bohm version, we never lose any orchestral details.<br /><br />There is a certain menace to this Tristan that is wholly lacking from the others that I've heard. The monumental love duet in Act II has a frightening beauty, and the orgasmic conclusion to that same duet is most intense that I've heard. The beginning of Act III is painfully desolate, and Isolde's Leibestod the most transcendental.<br /><br />Kollo and Price are a woefully underrated Tristan and Isolde. Kollo sounds heroic, yet doomed and resigned (which is what Wagner had in mind all along), while Price is the most feminine Isolde on disc. Although I love the Nilson and Flagstad performances, it's nice to hear Isolde as an Irish princess, instead of a Nordic valkyrie, for a change.<br /><br />This set comes with full libretto, and each act is sensibly placed on a single disc. Although some wouldn't agree, this Tristan is essential.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|This movie blew me away with its power.  A gripping tale of a civil war soldier trying to make it back home to his one true love.  While I would has liked one thing to be different in the ending, it is still one of the best movies in recent years.  A must own.
0060763280|5.0|Harv has a different approach towards affirmations and positive thinking. Instead of affirmations he gives us declarations. According to him an affirmation is \\"a positive statement asserting that a goal you wish to achieve is already happening\\", whereas a declaration is \\"to state an official intention to undertake a particular course of action or adopt a particular status\\". Then there is the difference between positive thinking and power thinking: \\"People use positive thinking to pretend that everything is rosy, when they really believe it's not. With power thinking, we understand that everything is neutral, that nothing has meaning except for the meaning we give it, and that we are going to make up a story and give something its meaning\\". \\"With positive thinking, people believe that their thoughts are true. Power thinking recognizes that our thoughts are not true, but since we're making up a story anyway, we might as well make up a story that supports us\\". <br />So I like this different approach, since affirmations and positive thinking really didn't do much for me, and it really did feel like trying to fool myself into believing that everything I ever wanted to achieve has already been achieved. It's hard to fool your mind. Harv's book emphasizes that action is a very important part in achieving your goals. He urges you to get out of your comfort zone if you want to get where you want to be.  <br />I like his style of writing. Very in-your-face, yet with a tinge of humor. It wasn't boring at all to read this book. My husband got this book as a gift from my sister and now I'm going to buy her the CD. I also signed up for the 3 day seminar and am looking forward to attending it with my husband!

B00004BZ0N|5.0|Yet I'm going to say some more.  While many, many people have expounded on the greatness and influence of London Calling, all of the hyperbolic praise has, if anything, understated the case.  While \\"greatest album ever\\" claims have been rendered meaningless by the sheer profligacy of their use, there's no disputing that few if any albums have aged as well as this one.  I'll put it this way: London Calling was released the year I was born, yet even now it sounds fresher and more vital than arguably anything I've heard that was released since.  Even the Beatles' vaunted material has dated considerably since its release, as rock music has evolved into ever more variegated forms, but London Calling's massive stylistic range has served to render it virtually immune to any such effect.  Think about it: what punk band has ever covered such ground in a whole career, let alone one album?  Granted, bands like X were branching out into differing styles around the time of London Calling's release, but certainly not with as much creativity or success.  Perhaps a better question would be what band, period, has ever achieved what the Clash did here?  Many of the bands that have been anointed as Messiahs since the ascendancy of the Clash (U2, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana, to name a few), while certainly not without their charms, have also been far too limited in their scope to measure up to the towering status the Clash reached with this album.  There are simply so many classics on this album it's almost pointless to count them.  Really, how many songs on this album have become standards since its release?  Ten?  Twelve?  Fifteen?  By any estimation, the figure is astounding, especially given how many different sounds it dabbled in.  Fortunately, London Calling is far more than a pretentious exercise in pointless genre-hopping; while the Clash seemingly borrowed from everywhere they could think of for this one, virtually every song is still grounded in the classic rock/punk aesthetic that was at the root of the Clash's work.  This focus, along with the band's excellent musicianship and incredibly tight songwriting explains why such disparate tracks as the opening title track, Jimmy Jazz, Clampdown, Wrong 'Em Boyo, Lost in the Supermarket, The Right Profile, and Train in Vain, along with about a half-dozen others could all succeed so spectacularly.  Whatever you think of the rest of the Clash discography, London Calling's classic status is absolutely without question.t was at the root of the Clash's work.

Not that I don't like the disco side of Madonna, but her most recent efforts have been less than stellar.  We'll see.<br /><br />Anyhow, I would have shaken up the songlist on the collection a little, to suit my tastes, but what is here is quite strong.  Rain has the same appeal as it did back in 1992.  And Oh Father still tugs at my heart.  Two songs I wish could have made the final cut are Love Tried to Welcome Me and Bad Girl.  Okay, Bad Girl is more of an uptempo ballad, but so is Rain.  To me, Bad Girl is unlike anything she had done before, or has done since.  It tells of someone who has hit rock bottom in their life, trying tearfully to make sense of it all.  At the same time, it is sonically mesmerizing.  One of my all-time Madonna favorites.<br /><br />Thank God that Something to Remember was resurrected.  It was a diamond in the rough, on Madonna's horrible vanity album, I'm Breathless.  Okay, any true Madonna fan should have it, but it's just a novelty item, so awful that it's beyond camp.  Yet, there was this gorgeous ballad waiting to be rediscovered.<br /><br />I know it won't happen, but it would be lovely to reissue this as a two-disc compilation, and include all the ballads.  There are several extra songs to fill out two discs- Bad Girl, Love Tried to Welcome Me, Inside of Me, Promise to Try, Look of Love, X-Static Process, Power of Goodbye, etc.
0792841344|5.0|Mike had no idea what he was getting himself into when he decided to follow his brother Jody to the funeral of one of Jody's close friends.  Mike watched from a distance, through a pair of binoculars and just wanted to be close to the brother he loved so much, especially after the death of their parents.  Well, after everyone left the funeral, Mike noticed a very tall man single-handedly pick up the casket holding Mike's friend and throw it into the hearse.  Quite a feat for 1 man considering the casket weighs over 500 pounds, but is he a man???? <br /> <br />Since that day, MIke has been hearing strange nosies, which he swears are not just in his head.  These sounds compel him to re-visit the funeral home and search for answers.  What he finds is that something very strange is happening there...but what????? <br /> <br />Mike pleads with Jody to believe his story, but it really is too much for the older brother to swallow, until Mike is fianlly able to bring back proof.  Jody's conviced and decides that whatever is happening at this funeral home, must be stopped at all costs...but how???? <br /> <br />This is \\"Phantasm\\"!!!  Don Coscarelli's classic horror film where nothing is as it seems.  The movie is classic for so many reasons, including originality, setting, the Tall Man and the flying silver balls with razors; but, most importantly, this is one of the first films where the victims are not screaming, scared 'wimps'.  No, our victims in this film decide that they will fight back at all costs and, although afraid at times, decide the cause is greater than their mortality.  A must see film for any horror movie fan.  The movie does not rely on gore to shock, but sheer terror and suspense.  Angus Grimm is superb as the Tall Man, who is probably one of the creepiest villians in recent memory and Michael Baldwin delivers an unexpectedly great performance as 13 year old Michael.  The soundtrack is by far one of the better of the genre and the film even includes a twist for an ending.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended!!!
B0001KZM3O|1.0|I remember that when I bought this album, I thought:<br /><br />\\"Well, maybe it's not as bad as everyone says.\\"<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />I also bought it because I'm a Pink Floyd fanatic and I manage to find the best in everything they do.<br /><br />Oh, but not this.<br /><br />This album is not worthy of the name Pink Floyd. It isn't even worthy of being mentioned in the Pink Floyd discography.<br /><br />I managed to get over Roger's so called \\"magnum opus\\" The Wall.<br /><br />Hell, I even managed to like it.<br /><br />But this, not this.<br /><br />I don't understand how could anyone manage to get over crap like The Final Cut, ecpecially Pink Floyd fans, who should really know better!<br /><br />David Gilmour: \\"I said to Roger, if these songs weren't good enough for The Wall, why are they good enough now? We had the most awful time of my life. Roger had got Rick out, Nick wasn't around much and now he was starting on me.<br /><br />A most unpleasant and humiliating experience.\\"<br /><br />I rest my case.
0062502182|5.0|Initially thought as a simple story manifested thru some straight and simple character-building. However, reading it with a more intuitive mind-set it really blows one away. All along the book are numerous fabulous sentences which really touch a deep chord within oneself and I have found them to be ABSOLUTELY true. Each of us, has had or have some dreams - the Personal goals. Why do not we - mere mortals go out (and out) to search and obtain it? Why .. the bare and most hard-hitting truth comes out while reading the book - the reasons, the fear and the paradox of thinking that the goal is nothing but a failure. And also, it gives us a valuable insight into HOW to contemplate and comprehend the true meaning of one's goals and how to at least ATTEMPT to reach that goal. To be very frank, this book has changed my course of life - for after reading it, I have already decided to do something which I always wanted to, irrespective of the odds involved, the difficulties I will face. Such has been the impact on myself, after reading and UNDERSTANDING the book.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I'll make my comments brief because there have been many excellent reviews written already. <br /> <br />This is my favorite Pink Floyd album (yes, better than Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall). If you like, you can call it Roger Waters' first solo album, but it still has Pink Floyd on the cover, so that's what I'm going with. <br /> <br />The lyrics and music are very powerful and moving. Like most Floyd efforts, the lyrics and music complement each other perfectly. The lyrics are more straightforward and less cryptic, but I don't feel they are less artistic or poetic in any way.  <br /> <br />When this album first came out, it's anti-war message was very timely. In more peaceful pre 9/11 times, I think it began to sound trite to me, almost like it was silly to write songs like this in the first place. The songs are profound expressions of the pain, sorrow and the horrors of war. The political commentary is biting. Nonetheless, the album began to sound dated and I didn't listen to it so much. <br /> <br />The message of this album became frighteningly relevant again with the 9/11 attacks and the conflict in Iraq. The Final Cut is an absolute masterpiece. If you haven't listened to it recently, dust it off. If you don't own it, purchase it today.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Wow, I have not heard an album this good in quite some time.  Radiohead hits the jackpot with this one. Every sound is perfect. It is something very fresh and original during a time in which pop music was taking over the world (like, seriously). Radiohead reigns supreme with their creative, subtle sounding songs, yet still manages to hold onto the foundation of Rock. Fascinating. <br /> <br />The songwriting is impeccable. Their creative use of melody and harmony is, well, orgasmic. The textured layers of sound are bliss. There's really no exact way to describe their songwriting. Well, virtuostic might hit the right spot. <br /> <br />The album starts off with \\"Airbag\\", one of the more Rock sounding songs off of the album. Next up is \\"Paranoid Android\\", one of Radioheads most recognizable songs, and one of the greatest of the 90's. The middle section, with the ooooooooo's, is just flat out haunting. Brilliant. \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" is one of my favorite songs off the album. The lyrics are great. Its the kind of song that makes you feel good to be alive. Well, almost ;). \\"Exit Music (for a film)\\" is a fantastic song, starting out soft and quiet, and evolving into a stunning crescendo, leading into an orgasmic climax. Wow. \\"Let Down\\" is more of a fan favorite (I've seen alot of Radiohead fans say it is their favorite), rather dry lyrics, but good song nonetheless. \\"Karma Police\\" is another one of their most known, starting off with a simple piano progression.  <br /> <br />The album is split in half by \\"Fitter Happier\\" which is odd, yes, but preaches the concept of the album(which would be the dehumization taking place in our society.) \\"Electioneering\\" is the most rocking song of the album, with an uptempo beat, and good drum work. Good for n00bs, but most Radiohead fans recognize it as their least favorite on the album. Next is OMG, \\"Climbing up the Walls\\". Simply haunting. Favorite song off of the album. Yorkes crooning vocals set the mood perfectly. \\"No Surprises\\" practically starts out as a lullaby + a sweet bassline. Great song. \\"Lucky\\" is another one of my favorites. Starts out soft and slow, then, all of a sudden, you have been transfomed into a paradox by Thom Yorkes vocals. Then you hear the backing music during the chorus, and by now you are thinking \\"Are these guys freaking genius, or what?\\" The album closes off with \\"The Tourist\\" a great song, and very underappreciated. Slowest song off of the album, and once again, contains wonderful vocals from Yorke. <br /> <br />Well, as you can see, this album is pretty impressive. If you are a fan of music, you will enjoy this album. The greatest album of the 90's, and perhaps the greatest in the last 25-30 years.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|Most of the extras from the original special edition are included in this new version with some missing in action. Gone is the video portion of the audio commentary which did add a Mystery Science Theater 3000 quality but is not a huge omission. However, also gone are the trailers and the subtitled production notes that one could see while watching the movie. For these alone you might want to hold onto your previous edition.<br /><br />The picture quality of both movies has been improved significantly, although, maybe it's because I am so used to the old transfers that, at times, this new one looks too good. And then, some scenes look just as grainy as the previous edition but this may be due to the film stock at the time.<br /><br />The Ghostbusters 2 DVD originally had no extras and it still doesn't have any that pertain to the movie but two new additions are an episode from The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, entitled \\"Citizen Ghost\\" and \\"Partners in Slime\\" from the much inferior Slimer and The Real Ghostbusters cartoon. Hopefully, this means that Sony is finally going to release these shows on DVD at long last.<br /><br />Finally, there is a nice, glossy movie scrapbook that features more storyboards, stills and poster designs from the movies.
B0009WFF7M|5.0|For a price that is less than most CDs, you get both CD and 5.1 DVD audio! The sound quality on both sides is excellent. The 5.1 DVD sound is clean and well balanced. Great buy in my opinion.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|Ghost in the shell 2 is an excelent follow up of the first movie (ghost in the shell). Keeping the same characters and adding a new twist keeps you glued to the the tv. The animation is very clean and sometimes realistic. The only draw back and unfortunately ruins the veiwnig pleasure is the hearingimpared subtitles. I always watch my anime in subtitles and usualy have no problem reading it and following the movie, but this was annoying. I give the movie 5 stars and the dvd format -5 stars. <br />Do not let the format stop you from buying it however, becouse the movie makes up for the the lousy format.
0893860220|5.0|I read through this book once completely, and then I developed the habit of opening up a random page.  I found the message appropriate for the current state of mind. <br />1.  Once you learn about the self (as EGO, a bundle of thoughts and emotions), all feelings of hatred vanishes. <br />2.  Past - stops haunting you once you realize that past is just a product of mind and a bundle of memories. <br />3.  Present - becomes easy to live once you realize that what ever happens is automatic and is destined to happen - including the action and initiative by oneself out of free will. <br />4.  Future - becomes easy as something powerful leads you to the action to be performed for which you were born. <br /> <br />While I have read thru the pages of this book, I have not grasped the full power of words of Sri. Nisargadatta-ji in this book.  This will stay as my companion life long. <br />
B000ANVQAA|5.0|Until now, their idea of a \\"special edition\\" for this movie was a single DVD with subtitles and two alternate languages.  No commentary, no deleted scenes, no nothing. <br /> <br />It's about time they released something like this.  However, I can't help but wonder what took them so long.
0805076476|2.0|I read this book to see how it compares with the movie it spawned. The movie wins. Unfortunately, Palahniuk's writing style is stream-of-consciousness not done well. If I hadn't already seen the movie, I would have had a difficult time keeping up with what was going on in the book.  <br />Basically, this feels more like a book that is trying to hard to be stylish and cutting edge.  <br />I can only suggest this book as a counterpart piece to the movie AFTER you've watched the movie.
0425152251|5.0|Sophie's World is an unforgettable novel that deals with the history of philosophy, but is also ultimately a mystery with a fantastic twist. <br /> <br />When characters first start reading Sophie's World, they are introduced to Sophie Amundsen, a fourteen year old girl. She discovers two questions in her mailbox:  <br />Who are you, and Where does the world come from? <br /> <br />From those two letters emerge a whole lot of other thought-provoking, philosophical questions and Sophie is drawn into a philosophy course. Whoever is sending her these questions later teaches her about the earliest philosophers, starting with the natural philosophers and progressing to the classical philosophers, and more. <br /> <br />The revelation of who Sophie's mysterious philosophy teacher is a pivotal point in the story, and brings a new world and perspective to the reader. <br /> <br />Gaarder has done a magnificent job crafting this brilliantly-written novel. It is like no other - this book is not only entertaining and engaging, but it is educational as well. Sophie's World would be an excellent book for those who wish to learn about the basics of philosophy (the concepts are basic and pretty brief, but you get the gist of it). Although I had a bit of background knowledge on some of the philosophers that were talked about in this book, I definitely learned a lot I didn't know; the concepts are interesting and thought-provoking. This book is not only limited to those who want to learn more about philosophy, though - I would recommend Sophie's World to anyone looking for a fabulous, interesting book that compels you to read on from page one.

B000003TA4|3.0|You should really enjoy the first time that you listen to this album because it will never sound that good again.  This album is o.k. but I must say that it wears thinner and thinner with each repeated listen.  This is especially true of the second half of the album where they really seem to just be going through the motions and not putting much thought or effort into the songs.  I went back and listened to this album again after seeing it at the top of so many \\"greatest album of all time\\" lists because I thought that maybe I was missing something.  It turns out that I wasn't.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few really solid songs on this album. The first part of the album is stacked up well.  The first three songs are catchy, solidly written mid-tempo rockers that do a really effective job of capturing angst, frustration, and other feelings resulting from disaffection.  The fourth track \\"In Bloom\\" is in a similar vein but this intense and frenetic track rocks out even harder.  The stripped down (for the most part; intense multi-layered chorus and bridge not included) presentation of \\"Lithium\\" allows Cobain's lyrics to stand out and be even more effective.  He impressively makes effective use of sarcasm to get his point across on this track.  The next track \\"Polly\\" however is one of the lamest songs that I have ever heard and the rest of the album pretty much ranges from solid and impressive (Lounge Act) to derivitave of the band's own material (Stay Away, Drain You) to insanely repetitive and empty (Territorial Pissings).  Getting to \\"Something in the way\\" makes listening to many of the lesser tracks worth it though.  This slower paced track with its outstanding vocals and moody string arrangement is this album's true hidden gem.   This album is an o.k. effort and if that's all it was made out to be, then that would be, well...o.k.  But, this album is made out to be one of the top 20 greatest albums of all time and that is a crock of you know what.  There were quite a few better albums released in the 90's even, although \\"Nevermind\\" is far from the only offender when it comes to overrated 90's albums.  Truthfully, there were better albums released by \\"The Posies\\", \\"Radiohead\\", \\"Prince\\", \\"Public Enemy\\" and numerous other hip hop acts for that matter, and well...Nirvana (In Utero).  Historical impact is often cited as the reason that this album is rated so highly.  I say that's a crock of you know what.  What exactly is historical impact?  Is it record sales and media presence, or is it the influence that it had on changing the face of music by starting or more realistically, popularizing a new genre of music?  So why aren't other albums in other genres rated so highly for doing the same thing, and what does any of that have to do with the material itself?  I think that this album is rated so highly due to a severe case of the \\"monkey-see, monkey-do's\\".  So anyway, this album is basically a truly solid effort, it's just not mind-blowingly excellent like some would have you believe.
B0000636UN|5.0|This is probably her best album since Tuesday Night Music Club.  The songs from C'mon, C'mon get stuck in your head and there are some really nice harmonies on some of them. The only Sheryl Crow songs I don't care for are those that have a heavy country sound.
0385486804|5.0|I bought this book in the sequence of having reed \\"Into Thin Air\\" and \\"Eiger Dreams\\" from the same author. It is a very nice book and it gives the perspective of Chris MacCandeless life from the author point of view. You can notice that Jon Krakauer and Chris MacCandeless have much in comon and that Jon has much simpathy for Chris and understands very well the reasons that took Chris into is adventure and \\"In to the Wild\\". I think that every parent should read this book in order to achieve a better understanding of things that go throw the mind of their sons and daughters. Very good book!
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack. I was one of the first things I fell in love with in the movie. Rousing music that makes you feel like you are really there, but then, Disney always has great soundtracks for its films. <br /> <br />No one else has mentioned this, and maybe it's only on my copy, but I find that on certain CD players the sound quality is terrible. Even with the volume at a reasonable level, and the bass boost off, the sounds starts to resonate and buzz (other CDs that I use on this stereo sound just fine, so it's not a problem with the CD player). The CD isn't scratched or anything, either, so that can't be the problem. I put this disc into my DVD/CD player, and it sounded perfect, as it also does in my car stereo. So as a word of caution, your CD player needs to be very \\"forgiving\\", or its going to sound like you're listening to the music through water. Unfortunate, as this is the kind of music where you'll want to crank up the volume! <br /> <br />Also, I agree with the other reviewers, the soundtrack is much too short, and the song-list doesn't really coincide with what music took place with which part of the film. <br /> <br />Other than that though, highly recommended!
B000000OSG|5.0|While Use Your Illusions I ushered in the new, and arguably the best era for the Gunners musically, this fourth album took it one step further.  Starting with Civil War, a throw back to old Gunner days with original drummer Steve Adler on the track, and running through a gauntlet of rock n roll masterpieces, including a cover of Bob Dylan's Knocking On Heaven's Door, one of the most amazing and powerful covers in rock n roll history.  Matt Sorum (Drums, replacment for Adler on the Use Your Illusions I album), a personal favorit, shows his metel in the opening to You Could Be Mine, ripping through a gut turner of kick drum, tom toms and snar, as the un-toppable talents of rock monsters Slash (lead guitar), Izzy Stradlin (rythem guitar), and Duff (bass) step in one by one and tear through some of the most heart thumping cords ever recorded.  Axl is at his writting best with \\"Estranged\\", his power house anthem for isolation, and Slash's lead work through the entire song, (landing at roughly 9 mintues), is beyond discription.  Suffice to say there have never been rock leads before or since that match the work found in that song.  There are very few albums of any genre that can be listened to from start to finish without skiping a track.  This is one of those albums.  It is rock n roll at its best.

B00012FXB8|5.0|Although the original concept for Alien 3 (Helmed by the film's original screen writer and director Vincent Ward), sounded interesting, David Fincher's version is far more surprising, thrilling, and visually stunning.  This is not just because Vincent Ward's prodection never really got off the ground, (for full details check out the behind-the-scenes information on the film's special addition DVD), but because Fincher is a superior director.  This is the visonary who helmed some of the most astonishing films of the last decade.  Anyone who's seen Fight Club, The Game, Panic Room, and Seven, (one of the most disturbing pictures of all time), has to admit that David Fincher is a flood of movie making ingenuity.  The scenes where the Alien is chasing its victems through the tunnels, and the camera provides its point of view, still gets my heart racing even after all these years, and Fincher's use of light and sound add to the creepy, confined atmosphere of the planet Fury 161.  Elliot Goldenthall's dark music score just helps elevate this film past the overated James Cameron's Aliens, (Aliens was a good film, but I felt it lacked the visions and creative spirit found in this film and its predessesor, Ridley Scott's Alien).  The rape scene in which Fincher moves the camera from a high angle shot to a low angel shot as Sigornney Weaver is tossed through the door and into the step railing, mixed with the fast paced, rock like music Goldenthal pumps out, is a work of panick riddled genious.  Then there's the speech Charles S. Dutton delivers to the convicts just before they go on their sucide mission against the beast.  He delivers his lines with grit and a controlled fury towards his prey as the camera moves forward at a low angle, looking up past him at all his men who sit in various tunnels above him, like tribes men listening to their chief as he prepares them for battle.    It is a hell of a scene.  It's too bad this film was unfairly compared to James Cameron's workand critically lambasted by just about every critic on the face of the earth, because it is the best of the bunch, and an excellent beginning to an amazing directors career.
B0006399FS|1.0|Are you still blinded by this sellout band?. <br />Do you still pretend to believe that they fight for human rights, end of poverty, drop the debt, etc?. <br /> <br />Yes, I used to be one of those blinded fans too, but no anymore. Please read this: <br /> <br />\\"U2 Fans Angry at Band's New Web Charge - Sunday Independient\\" <br /> <br />\\"U2 DEVOTEES have accused the band of exploiting vulnerable fans after the band's website introduced an entrance levy on the fan forum.  <br /> <br />Until last week, those who logged on to U2.com could exchange opinions with other fans online free of charge, but now they must pay up the full $40 (32) subscription charge to do so.  <br /> <br />Now the band's supporters are so incensed that they have come together and organised a petition to save the U2.com fan forum called Zootopia.  <br /> <br />U2 fan Declan O'Reilly told the Sunday Independent that the hundreds of fans who access the forum were hugely disappointed at the abruptdecision.  <br /> <br />Mr O'Reilly, who runs a tribute website to U2 called Hanoverquay.info, said he was only made aware that the forum had been restricted to paid subscribers when he saw an emailed petition from a fan on his own website.  <br /> <br />The fan explained that the website masters claimed that the charge was to cut out troublemakers on the forum. When Mr O'Reilly tried to access the forum, he was denied, but given no explanation why.  <br /> <br />He said: \\"I am not a paid-up subscriber myself as while I attend U2 concerts and purchase the band's CDs, I don't believe in paying for the privilege of going on the website.\\"  <br /> <br />Mr O'Reilly added: \\"I am sceptical of the reasons why they introduced this charge and feel it is just a ploy to play on fans' vulnerabilities. I think that fans deserve a full explanation.\\"  <br /> <br />It is not the first time U2 have been accused of greed by irate fans. In January, the band's website message board bristled with complaints about the price ofthe Vertigo tour tickets.  <br /> <br />One fan wrote: \\"They tout themselves as a benevolent band, and yet they charge top dollar.\\" A spokesman for the band's management did not return calls for comment. <br /> <br />--Sunday Independent\\" <br /> <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I first saw the Celtic Woman concert on television on my local pbs channel.  I normally don't watch that channel, but the way these women sing really caught my attention.  I have been a fan of celtic music for several years now, and this is by far the best celtic music cd I have come across since Loreena Mckennet's The Mummurs Dance cd.  Chloe, Lisa, Meav, mairead, and Orla are amazingly talented. As many times as I have listened to it, I don't get tired of it one bit.  I highly recommend this cd!!  It is wonderful!
B00000JIL1|5.0|Strange that it may sound, I kept my copy of \\"Deuce\\" unopened and slotted with my other Rory Gallagher CDs for a year before I could listen. I had last heard \\"Deuce\\" on vinyl quite some years ago, and the opening chords of I'm Not Awake ushered me back to my college days and debates with my friends about the merits of Mr. Gallagher's guitar mastery. The energy that flows from this music crackles, whether Mr. Gallagher is playing acoustic blues, coaxing magic from his slide, or wringing out just the right amount of feedback.<br /><br />The dark, edginess of his first solo release have receded (though I love that CD for other reasons), and \\"Deuce\\" pretty much set the stage for how Mr. Gallagher's later catalog of recordings would be structured, intermixing blistering power riffs from tracks such as Crest of a Wave and In Your Town with plaintive blues songs such as Don't Know Where I'm Going and Should've learned my Lesson.<br /><br />His stalwart sidekicks from the early days, Gerry McAvoy on bass and Wilgnar Campbell on drums, generate the rhythm that sets the course, keeping things down to earth and lively. (Mr. McAvoy played bass with Rory till the end.)<br /><br />This remastered CD sounds clear and free from the technical problems that have marred some of the others. That clean sound, a fine bonus track called Persuasion, and expanded liner notes are enough to justify replacing older copies of this CD<br /><br />It seems that many folks tend to disregard Rory Gallagher but anyone who takes the time to listen will appreciate how fine a talent we lost in June 1995.
1932100385|3.0|The thesis of this book is that a strict vegeterian diet produces a lower rate of cancer and heart disease based on research supervised by the author and studies with rodents who were fed various diets and tested for cancer risk using certain specific models of cancer. <br /> <br />A good deal of the work seems credible, however, the author fails to review other researchers who have shown, for example, that diets that include fish without meat, also reduce cardiovascular disease.  Further, the study fails to account for possible genetic variables underlying the Oriental population and its health risks; moreover, the China diet although a healthy one, is not one that has been specifically studied in the United States.  Although the results are provocative, they are not fully convincing.  We don't really know what the Chinese died of during the study, probably infectious diseases among others, and if these diseases of several decades ago were excluded, based on modern medicine, I suspect that the results would be far less dramatic.  In summary, the author, a respected scientist, and his son, a writer, have tried to convert some research into the latest diet book, and regrettably, they fail to disclose the fundamental weaknesses of the approach.

I enjoyed it thoroughly and highly recommend this movie for mature vewiers.

The documentation of the life-long effect experienced after the blast, provides a most terrible and important perspective.  <br /> <br />There are excerpts in the book that try to put a positive political spin on the events that occurred after the blast, however that political spin does not balance against the awesome pain and destruction Hersey's eye-witness account describes.  <br /> <br />Anyone who is human should read \\"Hiroshima\\" to understand the horrible danger our governments and fanatics are placing at our doorstep.  Everyone who is in a position of power in deciding how to use these tools of destruction should read this book as a reminder of the human chaos they would cause. <br /> <br />Hopefully Hersey's words will remind all of the horrible consequences of the nuclear arms madness. <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|Possibly one of the best hard rock albums since Back In Black. you will definitly find yourself never skipping a track as for the whole album is like a \\"piccaso masterpiece\\". Starting off with the opening track \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", shows that the band will keep going with no signs of slowing down. The next 3 tracks \\"It So Easy\\", \\"Nightrain\\", and \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" shows a more decadent side of the band with heavy riffs and intelligent lyrics. After comes the hats off to drugs song \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", the party anthem has been a staple in any GN'R collection for years. Afterward comes the extremely intelligent \\"Paradise City\\" which is like a tribute to good ol' Tinsel Town. Then you have the 2 hard no BS songs \\"My Michelle\\" and \\"Think About You\\" which continues on with the ever growing power of their music. The song about frontman W. Axl Rose's girlfriend, \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" with one of the most memorible opening riffs in Heavy Metal history. Next up is the classic near-sex song \\"Your Crazy\\" which has it's moment as a GN'R hit. Next up is the real sex song with clever lyrics and great music \\"Anything Goes\\". The last track is the song \\"Rocket Queen\\" which is another great song of it's Music and is one of their best. Overall you get a great package with this album, and no Hard Rock collection is complete without it.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Being a long-time fan of KYUSS, I've been following the ''career'' of Josh Homme for quite some time now and can genuinely say that he's really one of the last great songwriters left in the whole 'alterna-rock' genre.  Everything he puts out is an attempt to redefine what he did prior to his most recent recordings.  'Lullabies To Paralyze' is no different.  Like everything he does, its always hit and miss, but I admire that at least he keeps trying new directions, moods and experiments while still keeping a trademark sound.  To me, the best track on the album, hands down, is 'Someone's In The Wolf'.  The riff in that tune is a monster.  'Little Sister' and 'Medication' pump along nicely, as does 'Broken Box'.  Those are best listened to while driving.  'Burn The Witch' has ZZ Top all over it and its nice to hear Billy Gibbons back in form. The European cd has the 'Like A Drug' bonus track and Gibbons brings it home, giving it a dirtier, bluesier feel than the original Desert Session track. 'Skin On Skin' is the only track I'd deem a waste of time.  'I Never Came', 'You've Got A Killer Scene There, Man...' and 'This Lullaby' are also decent tracks to listen when you feel like chilling out.  As usual, Homme offers a varied, interesting and ambitious project.  I've been laughing at all the naysayers panning this album.  Too many people are lamenting the loss of Nick Oliveri, Dave Grohl and the minimal utilization of Mark Lanegan.  QOTSA's best album was their debut which Josh Homme pretty much recorded single-handedly (Oliveri appears on the back cover but didn't play bass on the album...he joined when it was done), so the people out there that say that Queens lacks something without its former members are way off the mark. I get the impression that Homme was putting up with Oliveri most of the time and recording the 4 or 5 tracks that Nick sang on (which usually leaned towards being B-side material) as a favour to his pal.  I also get the feeling that the people who mention Dave Grohl and Oliveri only JUST heard of the band on 'Songs for The Deaf'.  Homme has written many many more good songs than bad ones and will continue to do so regardless of who he surrounds himself with.  This man's well runs very deep.
B00003BDXG|5.0|Don't believe the hype in Tom Keogh's review of this film. The mix-media format, acting, writing, direction, and most of all the messages here are first-rate. I know it's all-too chilling, upsetting and unsettling, but that's what it HAS TO BE. It's the ultimate wake-up call of its kind.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I didn't go seeking Hedwig, someone else got me to watch it. I admit that I had my misgivings about doing so, having a dim knowledge of what the plot was about, and even 10 minutes into it, I was still thinking, \\"Okay, I'm never going to like this.\\"<br /><br />So let me say one more thing: This movie is not for everyone.<br /><br />But it was for me.<br /><br />I really, really love this movie. Hedwig starts out in the beginning being a character that is almost too big for life, someone that you can believe exists but that you don't believe has a lot of depth to them. You start imagining that (s)he is one more glam-queen failed rock-star stereotype that has found her/his way into a movie. That's what threw me towards not liking this movie.<br /><br />But it's simply not true, not even vaguely. As the movie progresses, you start to see the subtle shades that this character possesses; you see the tragedies that have bounced this character through his/her life, see the triumphs that (s)he almost touched, you see the things that are important and that make her/him who (s)he is....and you begin to realize that Hedwig might be, just might be...beautiful.<br /><br />That's right. That's the conclusion I came to at the end of the movie, that despite all the strange and bad things that had beaten this character through his/her life, that at the end of the day the only thing that Hedwig really wanted was to be loved for who (s)he really is on the inside. That idea is what sets this movie ten leagues above other movies like it; it's an almost phantom-of-the-opera-ish idea, hiding behind the make-up and lights just to try and reach out to people who will never understand.<br /><br />There is also the idea of this being a sort of love story. It's not a boy-girl love story by any means but more of a soul-mate kind. Where is the other half that completes each of us? Who is it? What energy type is it? Masculine? Feminine? This movie takes that idea and blurs the edges, making us guess at it until the final scenes in the movie. It comes across in such a way as to make anyone think about the idea (no matter what their personal ideas on gender roles might be). It's presented in a very positive fashion.<br /><br />If you're going to watch this movie, let me at least point out the one thing that ought to be obvious (but should still be pointed out): Listen to the lyrics!!!! The songs are subtle (and great!) and help move the story along in a way that simple dialogue could never do. The anger and sadness that is built into them is inspiring to behold. This is what a modern musical should look like.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like (and is worth noting) would be some of the sets. I didn't like the fold-down trailer that acted as a sort of stage for one of the movie's songs. I didn't like how tight the shots were when the boy (Gnosis) goes to watch Hedwig perform with his Asian back-up band (which was funny). Some of those things got on my nerves...but they are tiny, insignificant details that should never, ever keep you from seeing this movie.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you don't have inhibitions and want to enjoy a well-told tale with a lot of depth to it, this is a great movie!ess at it until the final scenes in the movie.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is an awesome album, filled with tons of different sounding songs. I can't BELIEVE that some people called The Clash poseurs and compared them to bands like Blink 182. These guys are about as punk as you can get. Punk isn't just about screaming and swearing all the time. Punk is about rebelling, and not rebelling against Mommy and Daddy, it means rebelling against the government, and I've lost count of how many times The Clash have done that. Sure, they are more mature then say, The Sex Pistols, you have to read in between the lines here, and they have a lot more sound in their songs then just your average punk band. One thing that you can be sure of here is that The Clash NEVER sold out, they did what they had to, and even refused to be put on pop charts, they put what they wanted to into their music, and didn't care who they pissed off while they were at it, and isn't that what punk is about?? These are some of the best songs I've ever heard, and The Clash IS one of my favorite bands, it truly is a masterpiece. I'm a Green Day fan and all, but saying that \\"Dookie\\" was the beginning of punk is a complete and total lie, Green Day were Clash fans and looked up to them, hell, I even have a picture of Billie Joe holding THIS very album. Right now, Johnny Rotten is living a luxurious life, probably somewhere in England, enjoying all the money he made while he was belting out songs like \\"God Save The Queen\\", but Joe Strummer tried to change the world for the better, he was an awesome guy, and he really tried to make a difference, he may be gone, but he's not forgotten. R.I.P. Joe Strummer, and buy this album, it's worth every penny.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is the Hello Kitty of movies. You've seen it in passing. You've given it a glance. You've thought 'geez, that looks kinda...' and you never in any of those times came up with a good enough word to describe what it actually is. Is the word 'sweet'? Is the word 'sappy'? Is the word 'stupid'? Most of all, you're pretty sure that you're just going to hate it- after all, who can pack so much attitude into one little box and still have it come out as something you can respect?<br /><br />If you can get past your initial misgivings about the cute-sy factor of the lead actress (and those big, glowing eyes) then you're in for a real treat. The word you were looking for to describe how you might feel about this movie is going to be none of those I mentioned...instead, you might walk away and think 'sure-fire' or 'sha-zam!' or 'crap, I can't believe this movie made me think of those words...I never use those words!'<br /><br />But they're very much applicable in this case. The story, the acting, the direction, the visuals...they all zing along at their own pace; it's a tempo just shy of break-neck and right above average. The visuals blend with that tempo, creating a whole storyboard that makes us feel as though we are on some wild roller-coaster ride that we didn't really ask to be on but can't help but be grateful for all the same.<br /><br />All of the actors commit themselves to being the characters that they have come to play for the audience and each of them own their roles. When Mathieu Kassovitz's character is first seen digging under the photo booth, we never think 'what a weirdo' but instead find ourselves kind of drawn into thinking 'who is this strange man?'...lured into thinking it by the simple acceptance of the title character. Amelie is a unique young lady whose view of the world sets the stage for the entire movie; where some characters might annoy the audience in other movies, Amelie's acceptance and view of them make them real people who have real problems who really need saving.<br /><br />That's what makes this movie so endearing, that it's a super hero movie without a super hero about real people with real problems stuck in their own real hell who are all saved by a person who probably could not ever exist. Amelie rushes from person to person, a preternatural understanding of the way they work and how to solve their problems guiding her through the whole movie, ricocheting from adventure to adventure, saving countless lives in a webbed intricacy that leaves us dizzy and dazzled...and again, what makes that work is our own need to be saved in our own real lives, in our own real hell, in our own...you get the picture.<br /><br />But where it might become bogged down in taking itself too seriously with it's save-the-world attitude, the movie instead turns cute, cloaking it's external functions with jokes and winks that make us wonder if it's trying to be dirty or if we're just stuffy conservatives. When Amelie wonders to herself 'How many people are having orgasms right now?' that question is answered in a spectacular montage that is primed by Audrey Tautou's sheepish smile at the end of it. '15' she whispers to the camera. It's this sort of thing that makes the movie not only bearable, but also exquisitely delightful to watch.<br /><br />Bottom Line: there is a special DVD set out now that has this movie in it; you can find it at any local Walmart...my advice is to go out and buy it because it needs to be a permanent part of your collection.<br /><br />-LP<br /><br />The PS Warning: this movie is NOT IN ENGLISH! For those of you who didn't already know that I did not want to be misleading by suggesting that Amelie actually said the word '15'. But! But!

0593051580|5.0|This book explores the talents of the Chinese, a nation that for many years has been hidden. Few books are written about China's history, but Gavin has pieced together the events of China discovery and exploration of the world. No doubt this book will challenge many people's ideas about early exploration, but at the the same time enough facts are given to substiantiate this tremendous effort of discovery. This is a well written book that is easy to read, but could benefit from additional charts and explanations.
B00009ZYC0|4.0|+++++<br /><br />This intelligent science fiction movie is based on the short story \\"The Minority Report\\" (1956) written by Philip K. Dick (1928 to 1982).<br /><br />In the mid-21ST century, murderers are caught before they actually commit the murder.  How is this achieved?  By harnessing the extraordinary power of mutant humans who have the ability of precognition (the perception of an event, murder in the movie's case, before it occurs.)  These mutant humans are called \\"precogs.\\"<br /><br />The police force utilizes these precogs (there are three) by developing a \\"Precrime\\" unit.  This unit is headed by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) and the director of the unit is Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).  The new system is working well until one day the precogs have a prevision that the Chief himself will commit a murder.  The rest of the movie is about the Chief running from the Precrime unit and trying to find proof of his innocence.<br /><br />Now that you know what the movie is about you might ask why it has such a strange title.  When the three precogs all agree on a prevision of murder, a \\"majority report\\" is generated.  If two precogs agree but one disagrees, then a \\"minority report\\" is generated.  (It is this minority report that the Chief is after to prove his innocence.)<br /><br />This movie was directed by Steven Spielberg and it shows.  He has taken a short story and effectively expanded it.<br /><br />The special effects showing this future world are fantastic.  However, Spielberg does not let these special effects dominate the movie.<br /><br />There is also good background music and in some scenes, classical music is even used.<br /><br />The acting is well done.  Cruise as the Chief effectively carries the movie while Max Von Sydow gives a good performance as the aging director.<br /><br />Some say that the ending of this movie is not very good.  I disagree.  It portrays what a reasonable, rational society would do.<br /><br />There is only one flaw that I detected in the story.  Once the Chief is declared a future murderer, he shouldn't have access to the Precrime unit's headquarters.  Yet he does!  (It should be noted that I discovered this flaw after the movie was over.  This flaw never occurred to me as I was viewing the movie because I was so absorbed in the story.)<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (single disc edition) is perfect with respect to picture and sound quality.  It has two extras, both of which I found interesting.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like intelligent fast-paced science fiction mystery thrillers, then this is the movie for you!!<br /><br />**** 1/2<br /><br />(2002;  145 min;  widescreen;  24 scenes)<br /><br />+++++I detected in the story.

B00005JM20|5.0|Johnny English is definitely one of those movies where you just can't imagine any other actor playing the lead role than the one chosen.  Rowan Atkinson plays a character who is as adorable and driven as he is a pathetic idiot, which actually somehow makes it believable that a female character could fall for him.  Between Johnny English's charm, his joie de vivre, one cannot help but fall in love with this character whose determination constantly leads him to ruin every mission he takes on.  Despite the obvious blunders, it is the subtle moments that cause the greatest laughs.  Atkinson's remarkable timing and his subtle physical actions will bring on the laughs regardless of what script is thrown his way.  I had seen some of his earlier works (Bean) and I actually enjoyed this movie equally, if not more.  Though die hard fans seem to complain this movie does not live up to the Bean legacy, I see this film as a great introduction to Rowan Atkinson for those who have not seen Bean.<br /><br />No credit seems to go to Johnny English's partner, Bough (pronounced \\"Buff\\" and brilliantly played by Ben Miller).  Bough is the straight man who can actually get the job done, but due to his rank he must ride in the dangerous wake of his mentor, English.  The way Atkinson and Miller play off each other is astonishing.  Bough seems to recognize English's errors, but cannot admit them either out of respect to his superior, or possibly even sympathy.<br /><br />This movie contains the perfect balance of slapstick and spy action/adventure.  Certainly there is a moment here or there that I find forced or not as funny as it could have been, but all is forgiven since most of the film leaves me laughing more each time I watch it.
B00000JHAU|5.0|I first found out about this group when I heard the song \\"Stars of track and field\\" in the 2002 movie \\"Pumpkin.\\" I immediately liked the song and looked them up. Having been the first album I heard by them, it turned out to be a good choice. While this does not necessarily contain some of my now favorite songs, it is a consistently good album in that there's not really a bad song on the CD. You may find that some songs take more time to to fully appreciate than others. But if you give it a chance you will be rewarded in the end. While their first album \\"Tigermilk\\" was good for a debut release, \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\" is when they really got their bearings; just listening to the album this becomes apparent. Most of the songs are the same pace, fairly upbeat and energetic in sound. \\"Fox in the Snow\\" and \\"The Boy Done Wrong Again\\" are two of the slower more mellow songs on the CD. Though slightly more melancholy in sound, they are equally enjoyable tracks. This CD is a great introduction to Belle & Sebastian and still an old favorite of mine. <br />
0385338686|5.0|I Loved it, I had never read any of Sophie Kinsella`s books but after this one I`ll buy the others.  It was a great story.  It`s about a lawyer who screws things up at her job and looses her only chance to make her dream come true - as a partner.  Things get kinda funny as she tries to survive despite this huge problem. And it has a surprising ending.  READ it you gonna love it.
B00006FM77|5.0|Man I am so glad Chicago FINALLY had Rhino re-master this classic recording. This re-master is SUPERB! Anybody who has listened to \\"Chicago\\" these past 20 years has got to listen to this to hear what the Real Chicago sounded like in their prime. This band, featuring the great Terry Kath on lead vocals and guitar, just kicked ass! Terry's guitar work here is incredible! Some of the best moments here involve long jams with Kath, Peter Cetera on bass and Daniel Seraphine on drums - all three of whom are no longer with the band. It still saddens me to think of Kath's death in 1978. He was clearly the heart and soul of this band. These guys were tight - great rockers, great vocals, superb musicianship throughout. I rate this live album as good as the Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East. A beautiful package, with all the original artwork is part of the deal. I have the previous CD release of this recording, and this Rhino version is a real big improvement. The stereo separation mix is real distinct; every instrument comes through with crystal clarity. Even the horns sound great now! And the extra disc here adds a lot, though I have to admit the quality of the sound is not as good as the rest. That said, the extra disc is still really great. The live version of Listen is incredible.<br />This great re-mastering is the icing on the cake of my Chicago collection. I have all the records up to and including the last one with Terry Kath on it. I used to have a couple of the ones after he died, but they were awful and I tossed them (literally! like frizbees!). Now on CD I have only the original Chicago, and I guess this one last re-master will be my final Chicago record. But that's okay - there's plenty of great music from these guys.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie is Art . I am having directing and acting classes in the university of Rome for 3 years and all i can tell is that this movie is one of the best ever made . Perfect black and white shot with great use of technicolor and and color shot spits . The acting is breathtaking and the story represents perfect the society in which we live today . It has messeges against racism , nasism and the domination of church . It has messeges of fenism , because it shows how can women be strong in such situations . The (mainly)jazz music fits perfect and the movie is also full of tarantino - like black humour . The sceneries seem to be something between a movie and a comic book . There is too much violence but it is used in a way to seem like something odd and disgusting , rather than most hollywood movies which use like it is something natural . All the actors have done great job , and they fit perfect to they role . Especially mickey roork , benicio del toro , clive owen and all the girls in the movie (alexis bledel i think is the highlight) are amazing . A total must have (forgive for my poor english please)
B00005JN5X|5.0|The movie is scary without being gory. It combines many fairy tales, including Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Rapunzel, Red Riding Hood, and The Princess and the Pea into a single exciting and interesting tale.  Terry Gilliam did a wonderful job.  If there is a problem with the movie, it is with the audience... modern American audiences are not literate enough to enjoy this movie completely.

B0007M22TI|5.0|A most uplifting and inspirational production that I have seen since \\"Riverdance\\".  You can put all your emotions into the music and song.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|This is the best Dream Theater record to date, IMO.  <br /> <br />I have read reviews about this album comparing it to Falling Into Infinity. And while it doesn't sound anything like it, I do see their point. Octavarium is more straightforward rock oriented like FII. Not that I am dissing their other past albums, but Octavarium does not have the Prog of 6DOIT, and it's not a heavy as TOT, but elements of those albums are present.  <br /> <br />The Root Of All Evil - The continuation of the Mike Portnoy-penned lament on alcohol abuse. For those of you not in the know, This song deals with step 6-7 in the 12 steps to recovery. (The Glass Prison on 6DOIT is about steps 1-3, This Dying Soul on ToT is about steps 4-5) <br /> <br />The Answer Lies Within - Jordan Rudess shines on this track.  <br /> <br />These Walls - Interesting Riffing from John Petrucci.  <br /> <br />I Walk Beside You - This track almost has a Coldplay-U2 vibe to it, Which I think is cool.  <br /> <br />Panic Attack - Heaviest song on the record, sounds like it was left off of ToT. Still an amazing track, with an awesome solo from Petrucci.  <br /> <br />Never Enough - Interesting Keyboard and Guitar work from Petrucci and Rudess.  <br /> <br />Sacrificed Sons - This track gives me chills whenever I hear it. It begins with some weird sounding arabic chanting, followed by samples of CNN anchor Aaron Brown describing the horror of the images of 9-11. I can easily see the last verse of this song being directed towards Osama Bin Laden. <br />  <br />Octavarium - THe 24 minute title track. I'm still trying to digest this track, but for now, I will say this track is pretty awesome. It's not ACoS, but still pretty good nonetheless.  <br /> <br />There you have it. If you have an open mind, you will like this CD.
B0000029GA|5.0|\\"Illmatic\\":probably,one of the best rap cds.For the lirycs,because Nasir Jones write of streets,of world,of times,of past and future...For the beats,because thwe album is produced by great people like DJ Premier,Pete Rock,Large Professor and others;for the featurings...becuase the cd contains only one collabo,but really intersting:Nas' homie AZ raps in \\"Life's A Bit**\\",beautiful track where the rapper shows his fast flow and his rhymes collection.Ahhh...if I must review \\"Illmatic\\",I must tell about tracks.Do you like jazz-rap?Well,Preemo produce two important tracks,\\"Memory Lane\\"(with an autumnal atmophere)and \\"NY State Of Mind\\";if you love Old School,you can't miss \\"The World Is Yours\\" that contains an interpolation from \\"It's Yourz\\" of T-La Rock (the song is poduced by Pete Rock)...Nas' first album is probably one of the five better hip-hop cds.And there are just ten tracks.With these ten tracks,Nas have showed that is not important the tracklist lenght...not quantity,QUALITY.-and he showed his skillz-. <br />

In almost every track you can find a Wu member,a lot of people say that this is a kind of reunion on a solo album.GZA's lirycs talk about many topics:Genius raps of the ghetto (Killa Hills 10304,story of a drug dealer),of music (Labels,a funny song where we can listen a lot of label's names),of corruption(Investigative Reports,track with a mafia flava,there is Raekwon and the co-chef GhostFace).GZA's second LP is a mix of styles and topics but you will find everytime that shaolin sound that is the Wu simobl.Great.If you haven't got this cd,move that mouse and click on GZA's \\"Liquid Swords\\".
B000069AUI|1.0|I dont undertand the hype behind this album. It's garbage. period. Buy some U2 instead.
B000002WU9|5.0|Well,when we talk about mafious rap,we can't forgot Raekwon The Chef,member of Wu-Tang Clan,that with his first solo album have created a new kind of sound and style.Under his sharp rhymes and his metrical solution there is a RZA...ahr,Bobby Steels without shaolin rules:just latinamerican's struments.Arps and violines rule on tracks,so the atmosphre is unbelievable.Near Rae...ahr,Lex Diamonds (once upon a time was Lou Diamonds)raps Tony Starks,aka GhostFace Killah,aka Co-Chef.Tony works on twelve tracks making performances just for hip-hop real lovers.In the cd there are also collabos with all Wu-Members,from GZA to the tenth WTC Cappadonna,and with a hot rapper straight from NY,Nas.Nas appears on \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" that is probably one of the most interesting tracks because mix crime sound with shaolin.There are a lot of beautiful tracks,like \\"Wu-Gambinos\\",where the Clan become a crime family and every component of the group choose an alter-ego (for example Raekwon/Lou Diamonds,Method Man/Johnny Blaze etc.),\\"Wisdom Body\\",and this time GhostFace goes solo,\\"Heaven And Hell\\",from the \\"Fresh\\"Original Soundtrack... <br />Wu-Tang Saga continues...yes...Raekwon The Chef enter in the legend with a revolutionay album.
B000002I25|3.0|This is not a classic. But it still stands as The Doors definitive moment. \\"light my fire\\" is one of the greatest songs ever...the rest of the album falters....with only few exceptions.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I believe that this record is one of the best rock albums of the year. It has the most honest and appealing lyrics which collide with awesome guitar riffs and catchy rhythms that you can't resist tapping your foot to. There's definitely something about the way that this album is so different from every other ordinary rock album. It's definitely dark--but with a beautiful uplifting feel to it. I would recommend it to anybody who likes rock/punk/alternative music. If you are into senseless rap music or nauseating pop tunes, forget even buying the album--you need to use your money on a psychiatric instead. To all you rock-lovers out their--buy the album. It's one true masterpiece you won't regret spending your money on.
B000001FS3|2.0|The album falters...Occupied by \\"Running to stand still\\" and other rubbish garbage. Buy this album but expect to hit your SKIP button after the first 3 tracks.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Would give this 10 stars. So amazingly original and fresh. This is the next wave of cinema and i couldn't be more pleased. Rodriguez proves he is among the most talented directors working. <br /> <br />Mickey Rourke is the standout. He really deserves an Oscar nomination(and the Oscar) for his role as Marv. In all that makeup he manages to make this character so REAL.  <br /> <br />Bruce Willis also exceeds expectations. Great role for him.  <br />Clive Owen supplies plenty of dry wit in a send-up performance of would be action heros. You have to really see the humor in Brittany Murphy's performance. Her role is purposely over the top and high camp, excellent job. Rosario Dawson is right on the money as the diva with some serious weaponry. And the actress who  <br />plays the Ninja like vixen is deadpan and quite the unexpected tornado of death;an obviously gifted actress.  <br /> <br />I hope this will become a series. This would be worth the $ every time. <br /> <br />****Parents be warned this is a very violent movie*****
B00007FOMP|5.0|Writing a review for this album is useless. Since it's a known fact that this is one of the top 5 recordings in history. Every song is a gem and a soul classic. From melodies, to the wonderful soul production...Marvin held nothing back. With the release of this masterpiece, he became the most important Motown artist...It's not hard to see why.
B000002OTL|5.0|this soundtrack is great, but it doesn't have the song that is playing when travolta and thurman are in jack rabbit slim's. It's instrumental and surfy and slow. Definitely not on the soundtrack. Does anyone know this song? help much appreciated.
B0000669JL|1.0|I dont see anything in this guy. I mean his accent is really annoying and you can't even dance to this music.
6305280762|5.0|This movie along with the first Airport, are to me the best of the 70's Disaster Movies.  One of the issues that sets the Towering Inferno a part is it's erie foreshawdoing in our post 911 world. True, this tower did not collapse, but this movie's outreach and dedication to the firefighter vocation are now quite chilling, epsp. as we start to hear how undersupplied the FDNY was to cope with the disaster of 911.<br /><br />This movie has a little of everything and for that matter everyone. It's co-stars are the then in their prime Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman, as well as Faye Dunaway,Robert Wagner (hands off your secretary, please) and the very sinister Richard Chamberlain. Fred Astaire has a part, as a down and out con-man, OJ Simpson is featured as the security guard who finds the fire in the first place, and there are a number of other cameos sprinkled throughout the movie.<br /><br />Maureen McGovern, the now very celebrated Cabaret Singer, was at the time of this movies release known as \\"The Disaster Queen\\" from her famous appearence on the Posiden Adventure, and the hit it spawned for her \\"There's Got To Be A Morning After\\".  In this movie she is back, and during the pre-fire lounge scene, she performs her lesser known \\"disaster\\" hit \\"We May Never Love Like This Again\\", complete with Mr. Astaire soft steppin on the dance floor.<br /><br />The acting is quite good throughout (my only issue being with OJ), and the special effects are amazing for it's time.<br /><br />This is a LONGGGGGGGG movie, but still makes for good viewing.
B000001DTM|2.0|Give yourself a lift...\\"One\\" is the only GREAT song here. The rest of the album is pretty forgettable.
B00000K3CK|5.0|This movie is a true American tale. Although the Department Store originated in Europe, American cities, in their heyday, took it to a whole new level. In an era long before Malls, shoppers whether they lived in city, suburb, or country, would travel to their nearest downtown to do their shopping at one of these grand emporiums. It did not matter whether it was Detroit (JL Hudson), Philadelphia (John Wanamaker), Boston (Jordan Marsh), Chicago (Marshal Feild), every city had it's signature store and it was as much an issue of civic pride as the baseball team was. When this movie was released (1947), Manhattan was to home to over one dozen grand department stores.<br /><br />Even small cities had the \\"it\\" store such as; Hess's in Allentown, Bergner's in Peoria, Pourteous in Portland, and so on.<br /><br />Needless to say these icons really shined at Christmas, and this movie took it's inspiration from two of the most competitive of NYC's grand stores, Gimbels (closed since 1986), and still thriving Macy's. Macy's holds it's famous Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC (Gimbels was in Philly), and after the original Macy's Santa was found to be celebrating a wee bit too much, Edmund Gwenn steps onto the scene as THE Kris Kringle.<br /><br />Maureen O'Hara plays the haried Macy's Personel Manager (it was not called \\"HR\\" yet), and she is found to be a bitter divorcee, and single parent (yes, even then people got divorced, and were single parents).  John Payne courts her, and I guess you could say wants to rescue her, and Natalie Wood from their very insular world.<br /><br />However in the middle of all this Macy's Santa winds up sending parents to,  horrors, of horrors,  Gimbels for better skates (and other toys), and for that matter any other store if Macy's does not have it better, or cheaper.  Needless to say Macy's Toy Buyer freaks out big time, and Santa winds up in a court battle over his sanity.<br /><br />It all works out in the end, and if ever there is a time for a good old fashioned Hollywood ending it's Christmas time.<br /><br />A true American tale that can't make you feel anything, but good!a good old fashioned Hollywood ending it's Christmas time. <br /> <br />A true American tale that can't make you feel anything, but good! <br />
B000002UAO|3.0|After the beatles relased the dissapointing Help! the album is decent. But not that great. There are some filler but there are about 5 classic beatles songs.
0385338686|4.0|lotsa time at the lake to catch up with some of my faves... ah sweet summer pleasure.
B000002UAR|2.0|To me it's this simple...this record is 40 years old...it's dated...the music is terrible..yes it's influential but that doesnt mean it's good music.
B000002OZY|3.0|Tommy was just done brilliantly by the Little Theatre of Alexandria in Virginia, and I enjoyed it immensely, several times. Hoping to buy a CD of the music they used, I bought this one. Immediately I was disappointed. Most of the songs are sung by the entire band, rather than the individual characters singing as in the staged version, and it lost a lot by comparison. I know that this was the original album, and credit the band for creating this great music, but definitely prefer the newer stage version as I saw it performed so wonderfully. I hope to find a CD available that is closer to that ideal...
B00004ZAV3|1.0|The remastering and sound on this album is TERRIBLE. It sounds like it was recorded in a 5th century building. Plus, all of these songs here are available else where and cheaper...so this is in simpe words, A WORTHLESS ALBUM. Best avoided.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|With one of the largest album tittles of the music history \\"When the Pawn..... wich is the begining of a large poem/statement that Fiona wrotte as a response for her missunderstood speech at MTV VMAs a few years ago this young genious and amazing song writter returned after the overwhelming Tidal , \\"When the Pawn....\\" is even more complex, troubled, introspective and beautifull than her first release , its a journey into Apples mind and gets you inside a number of existencial issues that just a few human beings are capable to feel related, tracks like \\"love ridden\\" wich is an incredible love statement, \\"Papper bag\\", \\"A mistake\\" very catartic, and \\"fast as you can\\" are not only great songs but also monumental statements for those people with more brains than the average, thats the reason why Fiona is loved as much as is hated (hated for the \\"nice\\" people). well , by October 4th 2005 Fiona will make her long awaited , long anticipated return with \\"Extraordinary Machine\\" the disagreements with greedy record executives are finnaly and happily solved , i can hardly believe it and im so anxious to have that masterpiece (im sure) in my hands   <br />lets wait <br />HM
B000002JS6|3.0|The first 7 songs here are amazing...but the last 2 songs are garbage. Definitly a great album but dont expect to play the album through without skipping a single song.
B00005Y228|5.0|As many times as I have listened to her sister Dannii's album \\"Neon Nights.\\" I can't find myself getting into it as much as Kylie's \\"Fever.\\" Kylie is obviously one of the greatest female artists ever. She has made one of the best dance albums ever. It is sensual, relaxing, fun, and just so damn good. The production flows perfectly with her angelic vocals.  <br /> <br />Best Songs: Love at first sight, Can't get you out my head, Fever, Fragile, Come into my World, Dancefloor, and Burning Up.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|Some of the definitions of \\"animated\\" are full of movement and activity or full of vigor and spirit. That would sum up this excellent second effort from my favorite animated band. When I first heard \\"Feel Good, Inc\\" on the local college radio station I knew it was a new Gorillaz tune even before the dj announced the band name. They've kept their distinctive sound even with some of the line-up changes. It's a fun, fresh CD (even if it has some dark edges) and is a refreshing, eclectic change from the same old stuff you hear on the radio everyday. I've been playing this CD in my car during my daily commute for the last 4 weeks and still enjoy it. The tune \\"Dare\\" has to be my dance hit fave of the year.
B0002S947K|5.0|I bought this album after I saw it got rave review by music critic guy on CBS Sunday Morning show. Boy, I'm glad I did. Great songs, great voice! Highly recommended.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Many people complains about the radical change on A.P. style, but a true fan fully understand the change and discover the masterpiece created by A.P. with \\"A Valid Path\\".  <br /> <br />Once again A.P. created a new evolution into music and every song, included the re-edited ones, are a mixture of feelings and electronics rithms, not just plain electronic music. You have to understand the names of the songs and listen carefully to melt the whole concept... that's what A.P.'s music is all about. <br /> <br />I recommend \\"A Valid Path\\" for true fans, no for the casual or those one that only like some albums. Enjoy it and join this path. <br /> <br />Best Regards!
B000A6T1KE|1.0|This movie was hyped as a film that would rival the second film and it turned out to be a poorly written and executed rip-off instead. <br /> <br />If you want hack wtriting at it's best or see how a film turns out when it's in the hands of a director who doesn't research the material, this is the film for you. <br /> <br />The only thing that can redeem this film is if they revive Mystery Science Theater 3000 and have a special with this film.
0156528207|5.0|Katherine Woods' simple and beautiful translation is the only one that does justice to The Little Prince. Published by Harcourt in 1943 and 1971, her English translation is the essential --- the translation loved and quoted by English-speaking people around the world, even by members of English- and French-speaking Canadian Parliament! But hers is OUT OF PRINT by Harcourt (who copyrighted her translation in 1943), so snatch up used copies while you may, or be certain you are getting hers in any new or used publication!    Beware of the \\"new translation\\" out by Richard Howard, first published in 2000; I accidentally got one. Ouch!  His \\"new\\" translation purges meaning and is not worth the money. It gives a falseness to one of the most sincere stories ever written. Howard's lacks beauty and is at times unintelligible: It simply does not make sense. Since Howard has no apparent understanding of the truths expressed in The Little Prince, this is not to be wondered at.    Near the end (Chapter XXVI, the Woods translation), the little prince says, \\"You -- you alone will have the stars as no one else has them\\"...\\"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night...You -- only you -- will have stars that can laugh!\\" (quoted by actor Robin Williams' daughter Zelda, age 25, in tribute at his passing). Howard's translation cannot match that for meaning, poignancy, or interpretation of de Saint Exupéry's words. Howard's lacks not only meaning but also heart, while Katherine Woods' translation captures both -- a matter of great consequence (\\"matters of consequence\\" being one theme that runs through the book) since Le Petit Prince is full of heart.    One example says it all: The fox's \\"secret\\" told to the little prince in parting (Chapter XXI) ---    Katherine Woods' translation reads: \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisibleto the eye.\\"  She uses the beautiful rhetorical mode: \\"What is essential...\\" In the original French: \\"...on ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.\\" In English, \\"l'essentiel\\" might be rendered \\"the essential things\\" or be put, as Woods does, in the rhetorical form: \\"What is essential...\\"    Howard's \\"new\\" translation of the same line reads: \\"One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.\\" Huh? \\"Anything essential is invisible to the eyes\\"? Far from expressing Antoine de Saint Exupéry's meaning, this generalization means, in effect, nothing. And it is obviously not true: Water is essential, and you can see it (more or less).    Katherine Woods' exquisite translation captures the essence of this line:  \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" Quintessential, no line in the book is more important. It epitomizes her entire translation. (Woods employs the poetic English idiom \\"eye\\" for \\"les yeux\\", a superior choice of wording.) It is ironic that, in translating The Little Prince, Richard Howard should lose \\"that which is essential\\" and that he should be unable to \\"see with his heart.\\"    Amazon.com's Editorial Review on HOWARD'S translation once said that \\"Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect.\\"    This would have been more accurately written thus:    \\"Katherine Woods uses poetic devices and a didactic accent to wonderful effect, capturing the essence and meaning of Antoine de Saint Exupéry's classic tale in a timeless translation. Unhappily and unfortunately, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified in a words-only translation, and he wanders off the mark, obscuring what were otherwise truths both simple and profound, giving the text a wooden effect.\\"    Woods' translation is the one that I read andre-read, and which helped me to understand why I grieved so when my great-grandmother died. We'd spent so much time with her. As the fox says to the little prince in explaining why HIS rose is so significant to him, \\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\\" He explains that HIS rose is \\"unique in all the world\\" (\\"unique du monde\\" which Howard translates, in toto, as \\"the only rose in the world\\" -- another bit of nonsense). This passage in Woods' translation also helps me keep in mind what I'm doing with my time, and why. If I watch T.V. the most, then T.V. becomes the most important. If I pass the time with my family, they become the most important.    Another always-to-be-remembered example of a passage from Woods' translation occurs when the little prince must say goodbye to the fox:    The fox says, \\"Ah, I shall cry.\\"    \\"It's your own fault,\\" said the little prince. \\"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...\\"    \\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.    \\"But now you are going to cry!\\" said the little prince.    \\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.    \\"Then it has done you no good at all!\\"    \\"It has done me good,\\" said the fox, \\"because of the color of the wheat fields.\\"    Before the little prince tamed the fox, the wheat fields (les champs de blé) had \\"nothing to say to\\" the fox. \\"But,\\" he had said to the little prince, \\"you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat...\\"    Once I disliked giant sunflowers. Then I discovered that someone I love liked them very much. So we planted some and cared for them together. Now, when I see giant sunflowers, I remember him and my heart is happy. I understand....because of Katherine Woods' translation of Le Petit Prince. It is as beautiful, profound and timeless today as it was over 70 yearsago.    --------------  NOTE: There is another publication by Wordsworth Classics: [[ASIN:1853261580 The Little Prince (Wordsworth Children's Classics) (Wordsworth Collection)]] with a translation by Irene Testot-Ferry which is ALMOST identical to the Woods translation, at least in the places I've checked. The pictures are in grayscale, not color, and the paper is similar to newsprint.    There are downloadable PDFs of the Woods translation online. Find one that includes the translator, though. It's not a bound-book-in-hand, but it's at least Woods' superior translation and it's free.    One way to get the Katherine Woods' translation is to make sure you are buying ISBN: 0-15-246507-3 (0152465073). As for Howard's translation, \\"NEW\\" is not better; it's just \\"new.\\"  Sometimes you can tell the difference between the two translations simply by the covers. Woods' shows the little prince on a white background; Howard's is on midnight blue, but check the ISBNs and, most of all, double check the translator and make sure you're getting the Katherine Woods translation. More Howard translations continue to be published in various, different editions and bindings. It is easy to lose track of one's search for the Katherine Woods translation amidst the plethora of \\"same-Howard-new-wrapping\\" publications.    Be aware that ISBN 978-547-97884-0 [[ASIN:0547978847 The Little Prince]] is the Howard translation with a very long forward/introduction by Gregory Maguire (published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013), a writer who doesn't speak French, although he says his \\"husband\\" does, pokes fun at the author's French name and the French language for a gimmick, hasn't researched the author much at all, and who seems not to know he isn't reading the translation that he (as he says) read in high school, which had to have been Woods' given that Maguire is 60 years old -- this, even though he is about to write a forward requested by the publisher. His at times inappropriate, pages-long forward -- which is  more about Maguire by far than about The Little Prince -- is a good reason NOT to by that edition, if Howard's translation isn't reason enough.    Near the top right front corner of this [[ASIN:0547978847 Howard/Maguire]] edition's brown cover is imprinted the example of Howard's \\"nonsense\\" that I quoted above: \\"One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes.\\" A clue, that. What a difference from Woods' rendering: \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\" Quintessential. THIS is what Antoine de Saint Exupéry's original French text means.    SOURCES:    Katherine Woods' superior translation: NY: Harvest/HBJ Book, Harcourt, 1971, pp. 83, 86, 87. (Katherine Woods, translator).    Richard Howard's inferior translation: 2 San Diego, CA: A Harvest Book, Harcourt Inc., 2000, p. 63. (Richard Howard, translator).    Howard's Translator's Note, by the way, illustrates why he should NOT have undertaken a re-translation of Le Petit Prince.    The Thorndike Large Print translation is little better than Howard's. I have never, EVER found a decent copy of any translation by Barnes and Noble of a non-English work. A good rule when dealing with translations of The Little Prince: If the translator's name is not given, don't buy it!    [Note: Review revised slightly in August 2014 to include Zelda Williams' quotation of the Woods translation.--Allie J.]

B000002G9S|1.0|Waste your money, the only good song is All Right Now.
B0000AYL16|5.0|Live albums can often be a misleading marketing hook, only because you believe that you're going to get a sense of more energy from a live performance done in front of an enthusiastic audience. UNfortunaltly, many are not and come out sounding like a studio album that was recorded in a stadium that is shared with an NFL team. Not this album. Frampton Comes Alive is still the best damn live rock album ever done. Yes, that's a big claim, but here's why; The overall quality was done first class. Post production was top of the line. You can hear and feel the audience getting into it. You have to remember this was the 70's and people were hurting for some straight ahead rock to listen to. Disco and glitter rock was the order of the day. Frampton, just a young kid at the time blows the audience away. What makes this album totally unique vs other live albums is that you can hear and feel the audience, like you're there with them.  They are part of the album, not just some background noise.. The SACD version brings all that to your speakers ten fold. Frampton and his group (still with him in the 21st century) put out the perfect live album. Hearing tracks like \\"Do you feel like I do\\" in the SACD format turned up so loud that your ears are in near meltdown is incredible coming from a recording that was done almost 30 years ago.  Spend the few extra bucks on this one. You won't regret it.

0930289528|5.0|When I first read reviews of \\"V for Vendetta\\", I thought I was looking at a graphic novel version of the Orwellian premise from \\"1984\\". Both books deal with an oppressive government set in England, however V comes across as being more relatable in my opinion. V utilizes a costumed hero/antihero who reminds me of a sort of poetic version of Batman. V is versed in Shakespeare, plays the piano, and has a hideout decorated like the dressing room of a community theatre.<br /><br />  The story is detailed in plenty of other reviews, so no need for me to be redundant. Suffice to say, Alan Moore and David Lloyd weave a well written and illustrated tome that plays with the reader's mind. I enjoyed this much more than Moore's other big title, \\"Watchmen\\", as I found V to be much more coherent and linear.<br /><br />  An enjoyable read, well worth the money if you have never read it before. Check out the original before the movie comes out. I don't trust Hollywood to do it justice, but I guess we we'll see.<br /><br />  P.S.- Interstingly, there is a complete lack of onomatopoeias in the illustrations (i.e. guns don't fire off with the word \\"Blam!\\" written all over the pictures) This really cleans up the imagery overall, and forces you to examine the details in each panel. Neat touch!
B000063DFQ|4.0|These guys are legends. FULL STOP. <br /> <br />I know these guys have been around for a while, but seeing them live has made me fall into their trap. I turned into a heavy metal chick, and loved it. Rock out, Enjoy, and Turn it up!!! <br /> <br />LONG LIVE THE MAIDEN!!
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|To support an earlier reviewer, 30 seconds to mars seems to do nothing new in this CD and to support this I ask you to listen to the intro of \\"R-Evolve\\" and immediately following that listen to \\"Adams Song\\" intro from Blink 182.... Same exact progression... sad isn't it??

0316172324|2.0|It's kind of like an example in the book: the doctors get sued for medical malpractice because they don't talk to patients as nicely, not because they make more mistakes than others.<br /><br />I keep reading the book because it presents some interesting information in good writing, not because the information presented justifies the book title or I agree with Malcolm's claims.<br /><br />To its credit the book can provoke some thinking, but after my thinking I'm not convinced of what it tries to say.  Many studies referenced in the book lack some important pieces to be convincing (e.g. showing that experiments constructed based on the negative theory yield consistently different results), while others prove much less than what Malcolm claims they prove.
B00005JNZ4|3.0|this movie is a tolerable, feel good, pretty funny, all right movie. they gathered some pretty good actors. its one of those movies that is not great but u gotta see it. it was slow at times. a lot of people will like it alot though. its not the type of movie that u would watch over and over again. then again this movie has some hilarious parts. great first time watch. good for rainy days. what is there else to say. diffinetly wont apply to everybodys taste. wont win awards.  <br />this is the miami reviewer. PEACE.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I have absolutely nothing against Chris Columbus' versions of the Harry Potter series.  I just much preferred Alfonso Cuaron's interpretations.  I like the fact that it's much darker than the first two.  The humour is sublte and the transitions from one scene to the other are great.  The new whomping willow has attitude and spunk.  Who'd have thought that a tree would have such traits?  There is one issue with which I was quite disappointed, and that was when Harry conjures up his Patronus when the Dementors were after him and Sirius.  It's just that what I saw wasn't how I'd imagined it.  What I had imagined was that his partonus would chase the dementors away and not just stand there and glow...Otherwise, the movie is great to watch, though I can understand why younger childern may get scared at some points...but kudos to Alfonso Cuaron because I think the movie looks and is great.
6305949980|5.0|I love this movie, that is why I bought it.  However, my girls, 11 and 4 also love this movie.  It is one we can watch together. And we can't wait for Tim Burton's next great film coming out this fall.
0156027321|1.0|I absolutely hate this book. It's so boring. The writer sounds really pretentiou. His writing isn't convincing to me at all. And I hated the book for all the useless descriptions on useless crap. Really, this book puts me to sleep. And I'm ashamed of even being seen reading this book in public. Yeh. It's that bad. But still I have to finish it because it's for school. The book sucks. Don't buy it. Hopefully my 1 star will bring the rating of this book down.

B00062IVKS|5.0|Scorsese's best film is extrodinarily compelling to the highest level. RAGING BULL is one of the greatest films made on the face of this earth. Scorsese's brilliant direction, the classic, moving score, the seamless film editing, the searing perfomances, everything.  <br /> <br />But what powers this film is DeNiro's portrayal of Jake La Motta. Words cannot describe how good DeNiro is- and he has and never will be- better. His richly deserved Oscar win for Best Actor was the Academy's best choice, because no other nominated actor for that award was even close to matching DeNiro's performance that year. He was aboslutely perfect for the role, and it is a crime to say that he was bad in this film. The supporting cast- inculding Joe Pesci and Cathy Moriarty are also incredible.  <br /> <br />A must for all people older than 16. <br /> <br />10/10
B00005RIKI|5.0|A more perfect album is hard to find. This disc earned Lynyrd Skynyrd a permanent home in my top 5 most rockin bands ever. The others are AC/DC, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and GN'R. Skynyrd though stands alone because they represent southern rock for me, opening doors for Allman Brothers, ZZ Top, and even like Charlie Daniels and stuff. They have a wide range and a sound all their own.<br /><br />THIS IS THE BEST GETTIN' DRUNK AND JUST LETTIN' IT ALL OUT ALBUM AVAILABLE, AND WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST IN THE SKYNYRD CATALOUGE. EVERY SONG SMOKES.<br /><br />I AIN'T THE ONE: Funky, twangy riff. Ronnie is rappin' off some crazy chick that reminds me of my baby's mama.<br /><br />TUESDAYS GONE: Ever since I was a kid I've known this one. Ballad song, train roll on.<br /><br />THREE STEPS: Awesome. I wish I was in a band again, I want to sing this one.<br /><br />SIMPLE MAN: Another ballad, recently covered on the radio by someone. The new one doesn't touch this version.<br /><br />THINGS GOIN' ON: A lot of bass in this one. It swings.<br /><br />MISSISSIPPI KID: Very cool, acoustic, mouth harp, pistol sound fx. I love a woman who was raised up on that corn bread. At least I wish I did.<br /><br />POISON WHISKEY: Another strait rocker. Kicks a lot of ace.<br /><br />FREE BIRD: FREEEEEEE BIIIIIIRD!!!! In case you don't know this song is worth the admission. Great lyrics, great ballad, insane extended guitar solos at the end that will melt your face off. FREEEEEEEE BIIIIIIIRD!!!!!!!<br /><br />Yeah, so get this one, for sure.
0790729644|5.0|To praise \\"Unforgiven\\" as perhaps the best western ever filmed feels like faint praise. This is a wonderful film in every respect.<br /><br />While some have complained that the film is slow moving, I found that steady movement towards an unexpected end to be compelling and informative.<br /><br />The scene where Gene Hackman's character explains to a writer just how gunfights really occur is wonderful - plus it prepares the viewer for what lies ahead.<br /><br />Eastwood has a wonderful supporting cast and as the lead shows a subtle range that should have won the Best Actor Oscar for that year.<br /><br />It's hard to watch this film and not feel chills when William Munny (Eastwood) steps into that saloon.

B0000041DF|3.0|I am a big fan of Argerich who is undoubtedly one of the most talented of all pianists. This particular performance of the Rachmaninov 3rd has attracted an enormous amount of attention, and rightly so considering the pyrotechnics that Argerich generates; the pianism is truly remarkable and this is a remarkable performance.    This being said, however, I do not believe this is a performance that I will return to very often because it is a performance that `wows' me, but not one that I can lose myself in. While it is exciting, it is exciting in the way that seeing a animal being devoured by a preditor is exciting - an amazing spectacle and a great story to tell, but not a scene that you would necessarily wish to see too many times. (Please don't read too deeply into this statement; I'm not saying that `The concerto is like the animal, and Argerich is like the preditor, and she does to the concerto what a hungry lion does to a deer', and neither am I saying, `I will listen to this performance as many times as I would like to see an animal being run down by a car', or anything along these lines; I'm just trying to give a sense of the impact that this performance had on me).     Nevertheless, this recording is remarkable, and is a must for all fans of the Rachmaninov 3 and Martha Argerich.
B00028HBKM|5.0|While religious, or Christian movies often get slathered with polemic reviews on both sides, I will put in my 2 cents from the viewpoint of a film fan, and not turn this into a polemic.<br /><br />The Passion of the Christ is a must see movie for any fan of movie making or film. The pacing is pitch perfect, and the acting is spot on and enthralling. The Passion of the Christ does not contain a single hokey scene in which I questioned the actor's ability. Instead, the story is immersive. Regardless of how you feel about world religions, see the movie and enjoy it as a well acted and directed story.<br /><br />There are so many bad Hollywood products being turned out that if you want a well made film, please consider the Passion of the Christ. If you rent it merely looking to strengthen your polemic, well...can't help you there. I have enjoyed almost every recent project that Mel Gibson has been involved with. This is no exception.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 82<br /><br />39 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />10 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />10 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />10 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />10 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />3 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?

1400031087|4.0|James Frey has a writing style all his own, and it works wonderfully in this book.  He describes the life of an addict, his tumultuous life on drugs and alchol, and his road to recovery in pages that seem to pass quickly.  This book hooked me from the first sentence, and put a new face on the notions of drug addicts.  Frey eventually decides to take on his addictions head-on by himself, which may leave others to believe they can overcome their problems without any help.  Yet, that aside, this is an excellent book I would suggest you read.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Good god, are these guys even capable of making a mediocre album? I guess not. Everytime a new Opeth comes out, I expect they will finally put-out a clinker, afterall, they all can't be brilliant can they? Well, the wait goes on because Ghost Reveries is already my favorite Opeth album after only 3 listens.  <br /> <br />I was a little nervous at first, with the rumours floating about that this album was going to leave the prog elements behind in favor of making a straight-ahead Death metal record. I worried for nothing.  <br /> <br />Opeth, with this album have succeeded in adding a keyboard player, becoming even more progressive, and yet getting heavier at the same time. They didn't get heavier by changing their music or approach, they did it by upping the ante production-wise. The guitars have been beefed-up on Ghost Reveries to a deeper, chunkier tone. My only complaint with previous Opeth albums was the somewhat thin \\"Iron Maideny\\" guitar tone. Not anymore.  <br /> <br />There's only one piece of slightly bad news. The mix could be better. The kick drums are so loud in the mix that they sometimes drown-out everything else. It's not too bad on a system with smaller speakers, but in a car with a sub-woofer (mine is set pretty flat, not-over-bassy)it can be very hard to hear guitar solos and things. On a Fear Factory album that's fine because the music is simple, all about the power. But Opeth's music is so complex that you want to hear all the interweaving guitar parts, and thats tough to do sometimes with this mix.  <br /> <br />Other than that, Ghost Reveries is a bloody masterpiece take my advice and grab it now.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|So DCFC signed to Atlantic and the indie world wrote them off. Didn't even give it a chance. Went by my favorite indie store this morning to pick up Plans, and they weren't carrying it. What a load of bollocks. I hold the view that if you like Death Cab for Cutie, you like DCFC and that's all there is to it...Barsuk (which is still distributing the vinyl special edition, you naysayers), Atlantic, or no label at all. It's f-cking Death Cab, you know? And this album doesn't change anything. No, it's not the same as We Have the Facts or Transatlanticism, but why would anyone want to hear the same album anyway? The band still sounds amazing, and Walla's production only shines a little more than before--it's not an overworked affair. Marching Bands of Manhattan, Summer Skin, I Will Follow You Into the Dark, and Crooked Teeth are pure pleasure, and that's not to discredit the rest of the album (except maybe Soul Meets Body), because in its entirety, Plans is beautiful. And I don't see the reason why true Death Cab fans should be required to take to the defensive immediately once the band signs to a major label. It's simply the same great band with a few new bells and whistles.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and now that I'm older, I get the jokes and I can appreciate Johnny Depp's incredible acting ability even more. He's so much more than just a smokin' hot drape!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is not just a delightful animated film, it is a spectacular film of any genre that fits on the same shelf with Casablanca, Shane, and other wonderful films about how lonely it is to be a wandering hero.  I bought this for my kids, and they all love it as much as the other Miyazaki films we've collected on DVD and VHS.  One of the first words of my now three year old son (who has been late getting language) was \\"Porco\\" -- a word, which, to him, meant \\"put the Porco Rosso video on now please Dad!!\\"  There is something special about this film -- it is at once exciting and thrilling, and at the same time peaceful, a kind of oasis.  From this perspective, for its nostalghic and evocative feel in the face of a background danger, I think it might be compared to Shane.  Like Shane, Porco has something in his past that makes it difficult for him to feel fully human and integrated with others.  That Miyazaki can capture this feeling and transplant it to an entirely unique setting, with resonances from his own life and experience, and tied to an even grander global scale shows once again why he is among the most remarkable, interesting and versatile of filmmakers we have (period).

B00003CX9E|5.0|I'm not going to weigh in on the silly debates over the merits of this film.  All I will say is that I've seen it several times before in theaters with decent to mediocre prints, but I just picked up a copy of the \\"two-disc special edition\\" and the transfer is stunning.  I have to say that up until I saw it on this dvd I merely \\"appreciated\\" the film as important; this time I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the compositions that look so fine on this dvd.  Whether or not you like the film, this is the edition to see it on.  A beautiful dvd package.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Firstly, if you heavily favor their older stuff (Something About Airplanes and We Have the Facts...) you're in for a disappointment.  However, this album follows the logical progression you could tell they were taking from the Photo Album to Transatlanticism to Plans, so it's certainly not shocking. <br /> <br />Ben's lyrics aren't as clever as previous efforts, even being outdone by Chris Walla's Brothers on a Hotel Bed, and the album would be infinitely better off if Someday You Will Be Loved and What Sarah Said never existed; but the melodies and basslines are some of their best. <br /> <br />Overall, Plans is a solid album.  Veteran fans might feel like they've sold out (because any band that signs to a major label is automatically a sell-out), bandwagoners will eat it right up.
B00005AR3G|4.0|If you liked Aladdin you'll enjoy The Emperor's New Groove.  The songs are quite good and the plot line is simple to follow.  You'll recognize many of the characters as modified versions of other Disney standards.  My 6 and 4 year old boys really enjoyed it.

0684857219|5.0|I enjoyed Arnold's effort to write this book. Arnold's guidlines and adwises in this book are useful both to become a good sportman and as well in other aspects of life. Arnold's self made success and his way to become whom he is very valuable. These valuables secrets can be seen in his effort to write such complate bible about bodybuilding. He has left nothing unwritten and as well he has avoided repeating telling the same thing. This book as he say, take hand of bigginer and guide him to bodybuilding and the necasary attetude to become a bodybuilder. This as well guide advanced bodybuilders to rich the top. I not only enjoyed learning about boybuilding by this book, but also, I enjoyed getting to know Arnold himself through his book. And I thank him for his effort to write this book. <br />Wish, he could make a DVD of all traning ways that he has menitioned in this book too. <br />Ta Seyed M A Mearaji
B00005JMAH|5.0|We've become used to the high standard of the Harry Potter books and films; \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" (the movie)does not disappoint.  Yes, the youngsters are getting older and even wiser but the excitement is still there.

If the words \\"Harry Potter\\" arouse your interest, do see this film.
0380789035|5.0|I've been reading most of the reviews on American Gods and I'm not sure that I agree with most of the criticisms given about this particular book.  I disagree that Shadow really isn't a character.  He is a character, but, as his name implies, he's merely a shadow of a man.  I disagree that the asides weren't related to the story.  Each of the asides, told in great detail, about gods who came to the land are all immigrant stories that deal wtih trickery or decieving.  I disagree that the gods were confusing.  Reading this book does take effort, in order to understand who the gods were and how they fit, but anyone with internet access or access to a local bookstore could easily find the allusion to the proper god.  Finally, I disagree that he gave us a bad ending.  The ending fit with the idea of a con, and that's the whole point of the book.<br /><br />In the end, Gaiman shows us that our gods are a con game.  The plot deals with misdirection, gaining confidence, and manipulation, playing on the Picaresque notion of what it means to be an immigrant to America. But it is all a con game of half-truths and amazing lies that obscure simpler truths.  Shadow is the arbitrator of these complex truths and shows you \\"how the trick is done\\" for the most part in this book.<br /><br />Shadow's lived all his life in America.  Half the comments made by him are about the weird world that is not far from removed from his reality.  I've been to some of the places they mention in the book.  I'm thinking that all of these places exist in some form or another.  There's a truth within this fiction about those places...and we see them through Shadow's eyes, finding what is both special and mudane about America.<br /><br />I love the misdirection, the wanderings, the asides, and the british beat of the whole book.  The purpose isn't to get to the end of a book like this, the purpose is to allow yourself to wander around in this world and realize how that world mirrors our own.

B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie was really strange but good at the same time. I saw it with Lisa, Tori, and Meghan from school. It was in black and white which we didn't like but you get use to it after a while. The movie was actually a bunch of little movies that came together in the end. There are also a lot of really vilent parts so its not really a kids movie (the theater we went to doesn't even check your age!). anyways, it was really good and you should see it :) ~*~ Jennifer Beekman ~*~

B000002UAU|5.0|I started collecting Beatle records around the time they were breaking up (although I didn't know it at the time). Every album I'd bring home was like Christmas, and Sgt. Pepper was no exception. I would rank it along with Rubber Soul, Revolver and Abbey Road as the Beatles' masterpieces and among the greatest rock albums ever. In some ways this album belongs to the tradition of English fantasy along with Alice in Wonderland, which was one of John Lennon's favorite books. And the theme or concept of the album, the magical mysterious world of Pepperland, begins with the album cover where we meet Sgt. Pepper's band dressed in candy colored satin uniforms, surrounded by a collection of luminaries including Bob Dylan, William Burroughs, Mae West, Laurel & Hardy, Edgar Allen Poe and Lewis Carroll. Each of the songs (after the first two which set the stage for everything to follow) on the album presents a kind of tableau or a world with the world of Pepperland. The songs represent a range of experiences, from the light hearted Lovely Rita, to the pure fantasy of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, to the mystical Within You Without You, and finishing up with the apocalyptic A Day in the Life. But contrary to the charges of some of the albums critics, Pepper is not at all \\"airy fairy.\\" In fact there is quite a bit of earthiness here. As Lennon said of Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite, \\"you can smell the sawdust.\\" On Within You Without You I can smell the incense. And two songs, Good Morning (nothing to do to save his life call his wife in) and A Day in the Life (I read the news today oh boy), begin with death, and the latter song finishes with the sound of the end of the world. Unlike some albums from this period, especially the psychedelic ones, none of the songs sound dated. In fact they all still sound quite modern, futuristic even. Though there is a nostalgic quality, especially on When I'm 64. And the whole Sgt. Pepper concept is kind of 1910 brass band (on acid) meets rock and roll. Its also the peak of the Beatles most experimental period. Unlike later artists who had digital equipment to create strange sounds, the Beatles along with their producer and engineers had to use their ingenuity to invent sounds, many of which can be produced now with the push of a button. Almost every sound on the album is either sped up, slowed down, run backwards or treated with echo. Though they had experimented quite alot on Revolver, on Sgt. Pepper every song becomes a kind of electronic tapestry of sound. One of my favorite parts of the album is the fade out on Lovely Rita, it sounds like some kind of abstract jazz. An extended version would be nice. And Within You Without You is not only a beatiful song, but one of the first and finest examples of World hybrid music combining western pop with classical Indian music. I also love the electric guitars on Fixing a Hole and Good Morning Good Morning, and the drumming on With A Little Help From My Friends and A Day In The Life. I've found that to really appreciate this album you need to put on a pair of good headphones, close your eyes and just listen to the music. Listening to this album really opened my mind up to all kinds of music including John Coltrane, Ravi Shankar and Brian Eno.<br /><br />As for the whole Dark Side of the Moon influencing the Pepper album controversy; in order for that to have happened the Beatles would have had to travel at least six years into the future and then back to 1967 again. Though it is theoretically possible to travel foreward in time using a black hole or near light speed travel, there is no known way to get back. Also I think it is highly unlikely that the Beatles had time travel capability anyway. I mean, they were pretty amazing, but time travel? Of course the boys did encounter some strange temporal phenomenon while passing through the Sea of Time in Yellow Submarine but its still much more likely that Pink Floyd were influenced by the Beatles than the other way around.

0156027321|5.0|Summer vacation was fun.  We drove to Michigan visiting friends and relatives.  The drive is long; around twenty four hours, but we could not wait to get back in the car and on the road because of this intriguing little novel called \\"The Life of Pi\\".<br /><br />It is an incredible tale of survival in the Pacific Ocean that starts in India.  The main character is Pi who grows up in Pondicherry, India where his middle-class family runs a small zoo.  As he is growing up, he learns a lot about the nature of animals and the business of running a zoo.<br /><br />Pi is a happy, outgoing, sixteen year old and he has a loving family.  He also has a penchant for learning and his curiosity brings him into contact with Hinduism, Islam and Christianity.  The reader gets to learn a little bit about each of these major religions and the people who practice them.  It is fun to try and figure out the symbolic relevance of religion as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Due to economic conditions, Pi's family decides to move to Canada.  It is not an easy decision.  But, they sell their little zoo and get on a freighter and head to Canada to start a new life.  Some of their animals are also going on this trip to be placed in zoo's in Canada and during the trip Pi's family feeds and tends to their needs.<br /><br />And this is where the story becomes a tale of adventure and survival.  In rough seas, the boat goes down and the only survivors to make it into a lifeboat are Pi, a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a tiger.  In a lifeboat, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, in shark-infested waters!  How does Pi manage to survive these circumstances?  It can be harrowing and frightening at times.<br /><br />The author describes this tale with such startling realism, you must believe it.  But, in the end he leaves you reeling out of control with another version of the story.  It is up to you to decide what really happened.<br /><br />This is one of the most intelligent novels I have read in a long time.  Teenagers will especially enjoy the high seas adventure and the enterprising Pi.  The 10-12 age group will get a kick out of the tale of survival.  My eleven year old enjoyed this story, but it does have some violent and scary moments that made me cringe.  It may be a little intense for anyone younger than ten.  This novel won the 2002 Man Booker Award and Canada's 2001 Hugh MacLenan Prize for Fiction.h seas adventure and the enterprising Pi.  The 10-12 age group will get a kick out of the tale of survival.

B00005JN5X|4.0|Some directors work best with their own material.  They can use another persons' source material, like a classic novel or a newspaper article.  But at the end of the process a film must bear the mark of the director.  He must have many different credits.  This is why many of the directors that most consider visionary best works come when they write, produce, and direct.  This is the undeniable flaw of Terry Gilliam's latest film THE BROTHERS GRIM, it's got all the trademarks of Gilliam's brilliant attention to detail, it's whimsical, and full of life and color, and yet the screenplay is full of ideas that are not fully realized because they are so small in scope and Gilliam is too large in vision<br /><br />THE BROTHERS GRIM follows Wilhelm and Jacob (Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), the very namesakes of the title, two con-artists traveling around French controlled Germany in 1812.  They have the whole countryside believing that they have killed trolls and battled all matter of evil thing, and it's not until they stumble into some real evil that the story gets going.  Somebody has kidnaped 11 little girls and it's up to the Brothers Grimm to discover who's behind the nefarious plot.  They are aided by Angelika (Lena Headly), a young woman who's two sisters were the first ones taken.<br /><br />To try to sum up the story any more would just confuse you.  It's a story that is far richer in texture, Gilliam and screenwriter Ehren Kruger has bitten of a little more than they can chew.  But they give it a shot and for the most part succeed. Some of the extraneous subplots involving the French Army are silly and stop the film cold.  I could have also done without Peter Stormare's over the top acting, which at times was more grating than silly.  I  especially hated his thick French accent that render much of what he says unintelligible.<br /><br />GRIMM should be praised because what does work in the film works so well.  I loved all the scenes in the tower.  I loved every moment that the Brother's Grimm are in the forest.  I love how Gilliam filled the forest with life.  I loved the colors, and the drab textures and how they meshed together.  I loved that the film made me laugh.  It's so hard to find a film with such genuine and unforced laughs in it.  I also believe the last twenty minutes of the film were breathtaking.  Monica Bellucci was divine in a role that could have been played by any pretty little thing.  In her hands and with Gilliam's attention to detail her final moments are as awe-inspiring as the dancing scene in THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN.<br /><br />As a matter of fact many will probably find many comparisons to the unfairly  maligned film Gilliam made in 1989.  Both films are rich in detail and try to handle too much at once, and yet both films are passionate and it's in their passion that the true beauty and wonder of our imaginations take hold.  THE BROTHERS GRIM may have trouble finding a mainstream audience to embrace it. This is a film that will probably bore the masses and yet will find a cult audience that will eat it up.  Like pervious classics in the fantasy genre like LEGEND or EXCALIBUR, GRIM is a film that will take DVD and cable to find its audience.<br /><br />I mast say the biggest disappointment is the ripped from INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM ending that felt tacked on and not needed.  This film had a natural and far more interesting final shot before the film ends that I would have preferred but alas, I was not in the cutting room (but maybe I should have been).<br /><br />At the end of the day what doesn't work is the story which while layered takes very few risks.  You can see what Gilliam is doing on the screen and how hard he's trying to overcome the weakness in the script and yet Kruger's script  is far too small for Gilliam vision.  I would have like to have seen what Gilliam would have done if he'd tackled the script as well.  I see his personal touches on the screen.  I just wanted a more personal touch on the story.<br /><br />All in all the BROTHERS GRIMM is satisfying. It's a good movie that will stand the test of time.  There is an audience of people that will be receptive to it, even if the masses won't.  It's a great concept film with a lackluster script.I just wanted a more personal touch on the story.  <br /> <br />All in all the BROTHERS GRIMM is satisfying.

B000000OMB|5.0|I've always enjoyed this album, and it was great to hear some of these old favorites.  If you grew up in the 80's, this is an essential CD for your collection.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I have just watched this movie for the first time today and I have to say that it is just incredible. Some of the movie is of Catholic influence, but the majority of the story is the same. No, this isn't too violent, this is exactly what happened to Jesus 2,000 years ago for us. If anything, it was even more violent than what was shown on the movie.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they focused on the most important part of the story, the crucifiction for our sins, but not really on anything else. They had segments every now and then of flashbacks, mainly when Jesus saw something it reminded him of something he did in his ministry in the past. I would have liked to have seen more of his ministry as well as his trial and cross. They resurrection at the end was a little short since it doesn't tell what happened after he walked out of the tomb alive.<br /><br />Jim does an excellent job at portraying Jesus. Perfect for the role, and if you know the behind the scenes story, he went through a lot to do this movie, everybody did.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic movie that shows what Christ Jesus went through for our sins, but it left out some back story. This movie would probably be understood better by those who already know the story. In the movie, they talk of his miracles, but never actually really show any of them. That should have been explained a little better for those who don't really know the story.<br /><br />With that said, this movie is very very good and is a must see. It's not anti-jew or extremely violent, it's what's written in the Bible.

0895260131|1.0|This book pretends to be a fair-minded book designed to tell the \\"truth\\" about Islam.  Mr. Spencer is said to have taken a fair-minded approach to an investigation of Islam and its history.  He claims in the book to have discovered that islam is neither tolerant or peaceful.  It is dedicated to holy war.  A further section of the book is devoted to a re-evaluation of the crusades.  His view is that the crusades were justified and done for all the right reasons.  He also clearly attempts to say that Christianity is morally superior to Islam.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />As to the book itself, half of its a denounciation of Islam based on misunderstanding and quotes out of context.  Despite his claim of having studied Islam for decades, he doesn't seem to have talked to very many muslims directly except christian converts.  He uses the case he builds against Islam to make the argument that Islam itself is an enemy of America in the war on terrorism.  [...]<br /><br />The other half of the book is a history of the crusades right out of the bad old days before Vatican II.  He might as well have lifted it from a Catholic school textbook from the 1950s.  The crusades are said to be self-defense.  Everything bad that happened was either a one-off mistake or isn't mentioned at all.<br /><br />[...] His history of the crusades is so biased in the book that there seems to be other agendas at work in its pages as well.
B000000993|5.0|great CD..my 2nd favorite Tool CD.. Disgustipated is te best song on here I think.. but Intolerance, Sober, and Prison Sex are great songs as well.....  <br />Tool fans..this is a must have
B000A7S4B0|4.0|By now, their change of sound is overhyped but BRMC are great at what they do -- whether it's spacey, Britrock influenced songs or the more down-to-earth Americana of their new album. <br /> <br />This shows a band at the top of their game -- mellow and thoughtful songs with a hint of pop in just the right places.  <br /> <br />It's great.
B000929AJQ|5.0|It is a great CD. NIN Fans should own it. Sun Spots, Only, With Teeth, and The Hand That Feeds are the best songs..
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Longtime fans that inevitably crucified DCFC after their jump from Barsuk Records to Atlantic will more than likely think that this album is just what they expected. But \\"Plans\\" is a more realized album than the band's earlier efforts -- it's not a case of major label-itis, but simply a band maturing and getting older. \\"Transatlanticism\\" it is not, but do we really wants retreaded songs from a band with this much talent and potential? <br /> <br />Hopefully fans will get over themselves and accept \\"Plan\\" for what it is -- a great album.

B00005JNTX|5.0|This DVD's special features are non-existent, much like the first release of Kill Bill. <br /> <br />This is not a comic book turned into a movie, it's a movie turned into a comic book! Frank Miller's gritty tale of Sin City is summed up for us in this masterpiece with excellent visual effects, damn sexy women, and some of some hard-as-nails men narrating the stories. Even if the story was crap, it's visually stunning. Turns out though, it's fantastic. <br /> <br />Recommended if you like Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, etc.
B00000099Y|5.0|One of the best Cd's ever... and i honestly.. have not figured out why that one retard.. gave this CD a 1 star and said TOol is the worse band ever.. i mean.. what does he listen to???? Jesus Christ.. wouldnt be shocked if he listens to MSI and goes to gay-pride conventions..
B000077VR3|5.0|You know what? I really did NOT like this movie when I first saw it. Why? Because it came with the topic where one of the main characters (a great character mind you) dies at the end. Something of which is a major rule on my part to stay away from these types of movies like the plague. AND everyone and the type of speed of the scenes made everything \\"loopy\\" and at times making me sea sick. Of course when I first saw it, I wasn't in a...peachy mood. Later, I decided to play fair and see it again and I'm glad I did. The 'death' scene didn't bother me as much as it should have because I think the way the story was played out made it easier to swallow. The one thing that I loved from the start was the music, dancing and everything else that had to do with creativity. I have the soundtrack that I can't seem to stop listening to and I (of course) have the movie that I never tire of.     It's WELL worth your time and money on this one. It's a sure bet. :)
B0000634EV|5.0|One helluva CD.. i have a booklet of my favorite CD's.. this CD is right along with NOLA and all the Pantera CD's.. it rules.. Ghosts Along The Mississippi is my favorite song on there.. Beautifully Depressed is another great song.. an instant classic.
B000002KDM|3.0|The title track is arguably JT's all-time worst non-tune. And Danny Korchmar's MACHINE-GUN KELLY is even worse. PLACES IN MY PAST contains admirable piano-playing from JT himself. HIGHWAY SONG succeeds in being every bit as musically dull as its title and its topic. JT's mystical banality reaches an all-time peak when he sings: \\"It's a Holiday Inn\\". <br /> <br />SOLDIERS is one of those too-short tracks in the grand tradition of Jimi Hendrix's LITTLE WING and Paul McCartney's I WILL. I'm convinced that SOLDIERS was lyrically inspired by a Byrds track called DRAFT MORNING. DRAFT MORNING starts off with the narrator pleasantly waking up in the morning and then becoming war-conscious. SOLDIERS does a reverse of that scenario. The narrator starts off with war-consciousness. And then at the end he remembers that day's morning when he had woken up in a pleasant state.
B000066744|5.0|I happened on this movie one afternoon on the independent movie channel and was intrigued.  I ordered it to share with friends who have all enjoyed it as much as I.

Ronnie James Dio has awesome vocals, Jimmy Bain has great bass lines you CAN hear, Cozy Powell's drumming is great, Tony Carey's keyboardwork is just awesome, and of course there's those great guitar riffs and awesome solos from Ritchie Blackmore. The album kicks off with \\"Tarot Women\\" which starts with an awesome keyboard intro from Tony Carey, and then Ritchie's trademark riffs begin to kicks in to make this song a classic opener.

B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth has become my favorite band over the last two years, and that list included in my lifetime the Moody Blues, Genesis, Wishbone Ash, Nektar, Golden Earring, Camel, the Strawbs, Marillion, Porcupine Tree, and the Chameleons.  You won't find a lot of continuity among those groups; their sounds are all, or mostly all, distinctly different, with but a few exceptions.  But the common threads that you may interpret finding, which for me makes sense, is the sounds of each group are innovative (for their time) and were not really matched in any way by many other groups.  Progressive music is the main thread for most of the music I've ever been drawn towards.   <br /> <br />Opeth is metal and the vocals are not for most music listeners.  But if you can absorb the music thru the unique dissonance of Mikael Akerfeldt's style of singing, which he uses about half of the time, and then allow his normal vocals to draw you in even closer the rest of the time, you will hear a sound that is not just brilliant but that continues to forge far ahead and beyond just about anything you think of as 'metal'.  For me, this is progressive music at its best, but hard-edged in every sense.  I was privileged to meet the band just quickly as they performed this summer in Austin, TX, and even in a small performance, they were captivating to my every expectation, and much more.  They are a genius that continues to reward their followers. <br />
0099267195|5.0|Charlotte Makepeace (there's a prescient surname for you) wakes up one morning and finds herself fifty years in the past, in the same English girl's school she knows, only in this case it is during the time of the First World War. At first understandably terrified and puzzled that she is being called \\"Clare\\" by denizens of a previous age who seem to know her, she soon pieces together the fact that she has switched places with a girl who is now living in Charlotte's own time, the 1960's. Charlotte and Clare ingeniously manage to communicate with one another via a diary hidden on the school grounds, and Emily, Clare's sister becomes the one confidant of Charlotte in a past that is foreign and frightening to her modern mind. Britain during this time is at war and terrible air raids are going on near the boarding school. There is death and sadness here told more darkly than in most mid-century novels intended for teenage girls, and it jumps to mind why Clare is so willing to return from the relative safety and prosperity of the future. I suppose the obvious answer is the love of family and familiarity outweigh lesser material things.<br /><br />Charlotte worries she will be stuck in the past, and exactly why she is there and how she might ever return home are carefully guarded secrets, revealed only at the opportune time, near the very ending: an ending which is very sad and involves the death of one of the two girls, a death that though of natural causes, harkens back to the fact it might not have occurred had the sacrifice that ends this book not been chosen. At this final point the main character poignantly becomes Emily, who waited thru half the twentieth century to see Charlotte again in the future, and discuss with her the events of the past they knew together.<br /><br />This story was the basis for the Cure song of the same name, with its dense, atmospheric video telling the story of two teenaged girls stuck in the same school in different eras. I admit I had no idea of the novel's existence during the time I loved the Cure song so much I named my dog \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\" in tribute, but wish I had. I think this novel may have gone out of print for a time, especially on the American side of the Atlantic, because I don't remember hearing about it until just a few years ago. I'm informed the ending to the version I'm reviewing was changed from the original in an \\"updating\\" and I've been on the lookout for a copy of the earlier edition. I have no idea why it was tampered with or what is different but hope I like it as well as this later one.<br /><br />One thing that has occurred to me as I do this review is I wonder if the character Clare from The Time Traveler's Wife was in any way named in tribute to Clare Moby from this earlier work on the similar theme of displacement in time?it I had no idea of the novel's existence during the time I loved the Cure song so much I named my dog \\"Charlotte Sometimes\\" in tribute, but wish I had.

I'll just say here: I wonder if there's ever been a novel in history that has made more people cry? Seriously! I remember finshing this book in fourth grade, lying on my bed and sobbing my heart out into my pillow so no one would hear. Even the consolation that some of Charlotte's daughters would be there year after year for Wilbur wasn't much help. I loved this book and spent a while wishing I was Fern living there on the farm, but boy is it the uncontested tearjerker of ALL time!

B000A1ENCU|5.0|I echo the sentiments of the previous reviewer. Why this film has not been released on DVD is bizarre.    However many titles have been ignored in the transfer.     EL CID  Sodom and Gomorrah  Samson and Delilah  Keys of the Kingdom  Shoes of the Fisherman  A.D.    Certainly some of these films are poor and others are outstanding, however for some odd reason, the studios have chosen to ignore these titles. My thought, at the time, was that like \\"The Cardinal\\", some of these films would have been remastered and released on the coattails of the magnificant \\"The Passion...\\". Unfortunately, this is not so.    Quo Vadis may be a definitive chapter to any Catholics's collection of outstanding films in an age where orthodoxy is a no-no in the motion picture circuit.    To ignore it is a disgrace.
B0006FFRW0|5.0|While I love this album, I would have dropped this to four stars in a split second if I had gotten the wrong feeling from the DVD side of this disc. <br /> <br />If for one second I felt that they just sorta half-heartedly went through and moved some of the sounds to the rear channels and called it finished, I would have been furious. But that's not how this comes off. It really sounds like they took a lot of time and effort to get it just right. I'm listening to \\"Closer\\" right now, and I'm hearing sounds that I didn't even know were in the song. And they're rotating around me. It's fantastic. <br /> <br />Any Nine Inch Nails fan with a DVD player and 5.1 speakers needs to buy this, like, yesterday. <br /> <br />Well played Trent.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|When an indie-rock band as intimately and fiercely loved as Death Cab for Cutie makes the inevitable major-label jump, it often telegraphs a painful death. Witness Husker Du, the Replacements, Nirvana--hell, even R.E.M. After a successful four-album run on tiny Seattle imprint Barsuk, however, Death Cab for Cutie just might buck the trend on its Atlantic premiere. Yes, you can grumble about the production (a little too slick), the proportion of ballads (a little too many) and the overall feeling of restraint (a little too much), but ultimately the album delivers everything the group does best in emotional, experimental songs such as \\"What Sarah Said\\" and \\"I Will Follow You into the Dark,\\" which both blend stark lyrical details with acoustic guitars and soft-focus electronics. In \\"Soul Meets Body,\\" meanwhile, songwriter Ben Gibbard has come up with the kind of blissful, beatific pop song that's capable of disarming even the harshest skeptic. \\"A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere,\\" he sings. --Aidin Vaziri  <br />
B000063DFQ|5.0|Possibly Maiden's heaviest album and one of my favorite albums from them.  A lot of work on this album is underrated (especially \\"Still Life\\") which is an amazing song.  How can you go wrong with \\"The Trooper\\", \\"Flight of Icarus\\", \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", \\"Revalations\\" and \\"Die with Your Boots On\\" the last tracks seem to go unnoticed by Maiden fans though \\"To Tame a Land\\" and \\"Sun and Steel\\" are awesome tracks (especially \\"Sun and Steel\\") \\"Quest For Fire\\" is the weakest track and still it's really not that bad. Buy this album. I hope this review was helpful to you.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Sometimes you hear a hungry, young indie-rock band toughing it out in a small town somewhere, and you just know that this band is destined to take the whole world by storm. Death Cab for Cutie are not one of those bands. In fact, even their biggest fans have to be a bit gobsmacked at their success. On their fantastic 2000 album We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes, Death Cab were already masterful, tuneful, resonant upstarts, in full command of their own eccentric guitar-shamble style. But these Bellingham, Washington, indie dudes seemed unlikely to ever go out in public wearing socks that matched, much less find mass appeal. Who thought they'd become high school misfit pinup boys? Who thought Ben Gibbard's melancholic tenor would get airplay, both with Death Cab and his synth-pop side project the Postal Service? Who thought these non-fashion-plates would become muses to The O.C., playing the Bait Shop the way the Flaming Lips once played the Peach Pit on 90210? Just think: If Death Cab had finished this album a little sooner, they could have kept Mischa and Brandon together.   Death Cab broke through with their fourth and finest album, 2003's Transatlanticism. That disc still sounds so great, it's a little scary. Gibbard's emotive singing and guitar found the perfect foil in the production of guitarist-keyboardist Chris Walla, who gave the big pow to songs like \\"Title and Registration,\\" \\"Tiny Vessels\\" and \\"Transatlanticism,\\" amping up Gibbard's purploid poetics without steamrolling right over him. Also in 2003, Gibbard teamed up with producer Jimmy Tamborello for the Postal Service album, which came out of nowhere to become Sub Pop's biggest seller since Nirvana's Bleach. Not a bad one-two punch.    On Plans, Death Cab's fifth album (and first for a major label), they try hard not to make Transatlanticism all over again. Instead, they reach for an expansive, Abbey Road pop style, with mixed results. The high points are high, just not as high as last time. \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" is a great start, with Gibbard chanting, \\"Your love is gonna drown\\" over an urgent guitar riff. The single \\"Soul Meets Body\\" has an R.E.M.-style jangle, sped up to electro-disco tempo. \\"I Will Follow You Into the Dark\\" strips it down to Gibbard's voice and acoustic guitar, which works powerfully for such a starkly emotional love song dealing with the imminence of death. Yet it demonstrates how wise Gibbard is to let the band mess with his pristine melodies, which would sound wispy and ignorable on their own.    Plans flounders in the second half, where Death Cab run out of songs and try to fill the holes with busy keyboard bits. They obviously decided to minimize guitars and emphasize synths, maybe inspired by the success of the Postal Service -- after the first two songs, there isn't a memorable guitar part on the whole album. This should have been a fruitful experiment. But mostly it proves they're a guitar band. Unlike the Postal Service, they don't have beats, not even theoretical ones, and these fussy little keyboard frills get incredibly annoying without any rhythmic drive. \\"Crooked Teeth\\" is a case where it all goes ass -- awful production, cloying melody, chintzy keyboards. \\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\" is a good ballad, but the rinky-dink synths turn it into a retread of Madonna's theme from that movie where Joe Pesci plays a homeless guy at Harvard. That probably wasn't the idea.    Gibbard's voice holds Plans together. As always, he indulges his boyish romanticism, more than ever now that he's contemplating mortality and shedding his \\"Summer Skin.\\" Plans ends up being more erratic than Transatlanticism, still their sharpest so far. There's no reason Death Cab for Cutie shouldn't keep trying to expand their signature sound. But as the strongest moments on Plans prove, their signature sound hasn't run out of things to say yet.
B00008ADPF|5.0|Nickelback is simply the most amazing and original band out there right now. I have no idea what they are going to come up with next. I had a friend tell me he thought that all of Nickelback's songs sounded the same. I crane kicked him and told him to go listen to some Papa Roach. Every Nickelback song is like a new story told by the master of vocal bliss, Chad Kroger. I also like to shop at Kroger, so that makes nickelback even better. I have a Kroger card that gives me special deals on groceries at Kroger that other people don't get like breaded mushrooms. I put ranch on those and they are freaking tasty. I tried to use my Kroger card to get backstage at a Nickelback show and the bouncer dude shoved me. I think Nirvana is a joke compared to Nickelback. It's like early baseball players that were slow and dumb, early grunge was the same. Nickelback took what Pearl Germ and Nirhaha started and actually made it something I could tolerate. I've now grown out my hair and formed a Nickelback tribute band called Quarterfront. I pretend I'm taking a huge poop to sound like Kroger and darn if I don't pull it off. Nickelback is my favorite band and should be yours too. If it's not, you're probably failing on the dating front like I said you would.
B000A3DFZE|5.0|<br /> As this title to Eric Clapton's new album has it, the guitar giant has now returned back home from his recent meetings at the crossroads with Robert Johnson (Me and Mr. Johnson, Sessions for Robert J) -- and the new album is a far more restrained, tasteful and slickly produced environment. Shaking hellhounds off your trail is one thing, but domesticity, one of Back Home's central themes, presents its own trials. \\"Now Mama's gettin' snappy/And Daddy won't change no nappy,\\" this married father of three young girls sings on the sprightly opening track, \\"So Tired.\\" (Must be the nanny's day off.)  <br />At sixty, Clapton is deeply grateful to be sober and settled; the specter of his four-year-old son Conor's tragic death in 1991 (the subject of his 1992 ballad \\"Tears in Heaven\\") lends weight to the celebrations of \\"the sweet, simple moments\\" of family life in the title track and \\"Run Home to Me.\\" Similarly, his lighthearted rendition of George Harrison's \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" suits the album's mood and poignantly acknowledges his deceased friend. On \\"Revolution,\\" a sinuous reggae shuffle, Clapton and his deft band (which, on various tracks, includes the likes of drummer Steve Gadd, bassist Nathan East, keyboardist Billy Preston and guests such as John Mayer, Robert Randolph and Steve Winwood) burn off Back Home's polish and heat the track to a seductive simmer. <br /> <br />Alas, if you're looking for Slowhand to ignite the pyrotechnics, forget it. He's busy out in the backyard, playing with the girls. But as he sings on \\"So Tired,\\" \\"Sometimes I think that I'm too old for this/I must have better things to do/But when it's time for my good-night kiss/My dreams have all come true.\\" <br /> <br />  <br />
0671027344|4.0|i would go on to review this in a well-thought-out manner, but it honestly isn't worth it. go to any trendy bookstore, and you'll soon hear the legend of \\"perks.\\" it's worth reading. it's honestly a good book. just don't give into the hype. you don't have to say that it's good if you don't identify with it. that's what make this book good. it's no literary masterpiece by any means. it just does what a good book does under the right circumstances. yeah, i know this isn't helpful.
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is definitely in the best of discography of 2004-2005. I read some bad criticism in the press. Honestly, I do not understand. The melodies are great, the Killers belong to this wave of musicians strongly inspired by the 80's, they modernized the sound and it is just so good!
B000AADYRQ|3.0|Like the White Stripes, DCFC has decided to do a piano album rather than a rock album and us fans will patiently wait for them to get it out of their system. Love the title, love the cover art, seemed full of promise and then ... eh ... not *bad* ... but ... it feels  a bit like walking uphill. And, so we're clear, I'm loved Transalanticism and We Have the Facts and Postal Service, so I have no aversion to any particular Gibbard style. But I know the boys can do better than this.
0156012197|5.0|This is the only book that survived the many moves between my early childhood and these, my middle years.  I pull it out every year or so simply to reconnect with the profound truths Antoine De Saint-Expery revealed about friendships and love. I came across this edition on Amazon when searching for gifts, and quickly stocked up for Christmas.   <br /> <br />A great story for children, an even better one for adults.
B00005JLWN|5.0|OK, I read a bunch of the reviews out of curiosity, while I was at the web site to buy the movie after my daughter sat me down and made me watch it.  I am happy to see that so many reviewers liked the film.  However, even in reading the positive reviews, I am often left wondering whether we both saw the same movie. <br /> <br />First, Equilibrium bears only a superficial resemblance to the Matrix, mostly, I suspect, because the Gun Kata sequences bear a superficial resemblance to the fight scenes in the Matrix.  However, 1) the Matrix takes place in a \\"cyber-dimension\\" if you will.  Neo can do extraordianry things because with the right programming anything is possible in a world where the laws of physics are just a series of zeros and ones.  The fight scenes in Equilibrium, although extraordinary, supposedly take place in the real world without time dilation or other tricks, as someone else said, without the cheat codes on.  More importantly 2) Matrix is a man against machine story more similar to Terminator (although stated vastly differently) than to the distopian universe of Equilibrium.  In Matrix, the great danger comes from outside of humanity, from the machines.  In Equilibrium, the danger is in humanity, in the struggle between the individual and the collective.  Matrix is frightening, but only like, let's say, a vampire story is frightening.  I can't bring myself to stay up nights worrying that my computer is going to turn on me, any more than I worry about werwolves.  Distopia I understand, and, yes, I fear it very much.  I doubt it will ever appear as portrayed in this film, but all the elements are there, and have appeared over and over again in the collectivist distopias of the real world, from the Soviet \\"worker's state\\" to the Third Reich.  A matter of degree perhaps, but not much of a stretch.  Thus, Equilibrium frightens me far, far more than the Matrix ever could, because it is possible.  More trivially, 3) the fashion statements in the two filmsare not the same, although they use the same color scheme.  In case nobody noticed, the clerics in Equilibrium dressed like priests.  Which is why they are called clerics and are trained in a place called the monastery.  The dictatorship in Equilibrium has obviously borrowed a lot of religious imagery from before the war.  Note that I do not believe that the use of this imagery makes this an anti-religious film.  There is nothing of christianity here except for the vestments, any more than the evil dictatorship is Khabalist because it calls itself the Tetragrammaton (which is YHWH, the unspoken name of God).  I suspect \\"Father\\" made use of these symbols because they still had power, and their origin has been lost by the time of the movie.  In any event, back to the point, the two movies do not remotely have the same dress code. <br /> <br />(If it makes any difference, I like the Matrix, but found its sequels, hmm, stupid is probably the right word.  Between the first Matrix movie and Equilibrium, while the comparison is a bit like apples to oranges, I would take Equilibrium hands down.) <br /> <br />I also do not understand the constant comparisons to 1984.  (OK, maybe I do.  They are both distopias, and they both feature a Leader (Father, Big Brother) who seems to be electronically everywhere.  So there are similarities)  However, if there is one previous distopia to which Equilibrium can justly be compared, it is Bradbury's classic Fahrenheit 451.  In both, the oppressor state targets specific cultural attributes and artifacts as much or more than the actual enemies of the state, believing that these objects in and of themselves are a threat.  Thus books and puppy dogs are both in danger.  More importantly, in Fahrenheit 451, and in Equilibrium, the dogs have their day.  The state is unable to eliminate the threat, and, in the end, the oppressed outlast it and survive, though in slightly different ways.  One must remember that 1984, brilliant as it was, had no remotely happy ending.  It was, to paraphrase Orwell, a boot planted on the human face, FOREVER.  That's what Orwell was warning us about, and why he is important.  1984 is a cautionary tale.  Bradbury, and Equilibrium, choose to emphasize the resiliance of the human spirit even under grinding oppression.  Despite the clerics, despite all the armed police, a resistance flourishes in the world of Equilibrium. <br /> <br />Of course Equilibrium is like other tales in its genre.  Big deal.  There ain't much new under the sun, as Solomon might say.  I found it told in a startling, and very emotional, new way. <br /> <br />I generally am not interested in the names of actors.  After seeing the movie, I still could not have told you it had Christian Bale and Sean Bean in it.  When I was told it did, I could look back and say, yeah, that's Boromir and that's the guy from Reign of Fire, so it must be true.  I still don't care.  Whoever they were, they did a good job. <br /> <br />The fight scenes were impressive, but I've seen better.  They were definitely novel.  Gun and martial art deserve to be more closely related than they are always portrayed.  But martial arts sequences are only props to a film.  They can be as impressive as one likes, but without a plot I might as well go watch my son at the dojo.  In this case, I liked the plot. <br /> <br />Or maybe that's the wrong word.  I FELT the plot, which, I suppose, makes me a Sense Offender.  I'm not even sure I can watch the thing again, because of the deep emotion it produces in me.  I would be too apt to cry in frustration or scream in rage.  That's what makes a great movie. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I can only say that the silliest scene was when Preston shot out a whole row of computer monitors and thus managed to \\"turn off\\" the presence of Father and begin the revolution.  (As a computer tech, I am all too familiar with folks who think the computer is the monitor, and that box under the desk is merely the hard drive, but I didn't expect to see that in a movie.  Of course, maybe in this world they did build the brains of the box right behind the screen.  Who knows?)  The best scene was immediately thereafter when you see Preston smiling and bloody.  It is truly a s**t-eating grin.  He FELT that one, alright.  Oh, yeah.  And so did I.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet has been one of my family's favorites for as long as I can remember.  The acting was very good, the script tight and the action gripping.  The special effects were cutting-edge for that time.  This isn't just another sci-fi thriller that goes from heart-pounding scene to the next with no time to think.  Forbidden Planet, a retelling of Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\", wrestles with the deepest of man's emotions and serves as a good platform to discuss man's arrogance and all the harm it has done him over the years.  But that is not all.  The action sequence when the \\"creature\\" is trying to get through the forcefield is one of the best for suspense, horror and effects that I have ever seen.  The graphic art and matting is outstanding.  And the excellent sound effects!  I still hear snippets in various ads and programs.  Except for a few scenes of bloodless violence, I would consider this movie great viewing for any audience over the age of 7.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|I first saw this movie in the theater and loved it then.  It's been great to see it again as an adult.  I don't see the infidelity as being glorified, if anything it emplifies how a forbidden affair is just a sad shadow of what a real love relationship could be.  This movie shows how each person changes and how the other has missed out on so much of that person's life and how they are only allowed just a glimpse of each other.  They aren't able to be available to each other during difficult times or take part in any of the joyous events. <br />None the less this movie is able to pull off a very romantic ,and on some strange level, a very committed relationship.  Don't we all have that person in our lives whom we don't get to see very often that rejuvinates us.  Hopefully those relationships are plutonic but in this case it's not and makes for a great story.
B00082IJ08|5.0|When the first Gorillaz album hit the radio waves it was hard not be charmed by songs like Clint Eastwood and 19/2000. It pulled together some different elements, had some campy fun sensibilities to them, and of course a slick presentation to the band itself. That said, it's not the kind of album that I find myself compelled to listen to years later, except maybe to play a choice cut that I'm in the mood for. It was a fun album in its time and place. <br /> <br />Demon Days is such a leap for the fictitious band that it's almost feels like a different project altogether. I can't help but be reminded of the Beastie Boys leap from Liscensed to Ill to Paul's Boutique (the former being a classic bit of simplistic 80s cheese that we all thought was fun and the latter being a timeless classic that might be the only rap album released in the 80s that doesn't sound dated).  <br /> <br />It's no coincidence that Demon Days features a prominent change in lineup. Producer Dan the Automator has been left behind for newcomer Danger Mouse, a bold endeavor which has payed off in spades. I was completely unaware of Danger Mouse before this album (and indeed his credits are few) but I do know that I will keep a close eye on anything he does from now none.  <br /> <br />Demon Days might be the best produced album of the last decade (barring, perhaps Brian Wilson's SMiLE). In terms of sound, Demon Days is completely unlike anything I've ever heard (though all the elements are recognizable). The spine of the production seems to be alot of very nimble electronica. Alot of it thudding and danceable, but with melodic threads that work well with Albarn's somber lilting. Blended perfectly into this fray are some very nice string arangements that recall some of the best of 70s soul, as well as some delicate acoustic guitars, pianos, and even a children's choir. It doesn't rely on predictable standards for constructing a coherent sound. The result is something which feels something like pop,hip hop, rock, techno and yet one wouldn't call it any of these for even a moment. <br /> <br />I don't know if there's really any songwriting going on in this album. There's definately melody going on, and it's very effective, often actually emotional (something I could never say about the Gorillaz first outing). But what I'm not really sure of is that any of it could work if it were to be stripped down. Lyrically there's nothing particularly captivating either, though nothing that turns me off either. But the album in its highly polished state it is perfectly effective, so I'm not sure that these things are even an issue. These same critiques could be made of Beck's Odelay, but the same sorts of strengths that make that album overcome these things work for Demon Days as well. <br /> <br />It's also worth mentioning that this album is clearly more of a coherent project than the first. The album has a beginning, a cimax, and a cathartic ending. It feels like a journey, and tracks flow well into each other, and sometimes work better in context than they otherwise would. <br /> <br />I've been listening to this album for a while now before deciding to write on it, and I can say with some confidence, that's something I will be listening to for years to come. It's just extremely well put together, and its sound is full, rich, and very fresh. One can only hope that this will inspire other artits in the mainstream to be as adventurous.
B000003TAL|5.0|There is a reason that my name is cynic-youth. I adopted this name out of shame, shame for doubting the greatness of Daydream Nation.  <br />When I first heard Sonic Youth, it was on Murray Street, an album that I enjoyed for a while, then filed away. I found its grooves pleasant, its guitars unorthodox, and its songs completely different from everything else on my shelf. When I was told by a respected friend to check out SY's 'best' album, \\"Daydream Nation\\", I bought it without hesitation.  <br />For a period of weeks, I hated this album. After the rollicking opener, \\"Teenage Riot\\", I found no reason to stick around. The songs had no substance or structure; they floated and melted away without impact or importance. I felt like a fool for having wasted ten dollars on a worthless album. <br />How wrong I was. <br />I finished listening to Pink Floyd one day and began looking around for something else to explore. Lo and behold, the shelf held the detestable \\"Daydream Nation\\". I listened again out of morbid curiosity. <br />It seemed like an entirely new album a few hours later. I jumped around the album, hearing snippets of songs and soundscapes, then settled back to experience it all at once. <br />When the second chorus of \\"Silver Rocket\\" came around, I expected a solo or instrumental break, perhaps a hip little twiddling guitar duel or drum break. What I felt drill a hole into my brain was pure insanity. The screech and hum of lightning and thunder rolling through my head, smashes of the cymbals punctuating an angry drone, a wash of screaming sonic love. I backtracked to the break again, then again. What I felt was pure joy, ecstacy; never before had a song sucker-punched me in the face and made me like it. Delving deeper, I discovered the unearthly distortion-drenched soundscape of \\"The Sprawl\\", the harmonic twang of \\"Hey Joni\\", and the blown-amp faux-thunder of \\"Providence\\". Each song building up to the inevitable conclusion, a cohesive message of discontent andhope within a daydream. For a period of two years, I listened to this album once nearly every day; I listened to nothing else. It withstood all my scrutiny, my misgivings, my ignorance. Now, I see it as it truly is: one of the greatest albums of all time, a feedback symphony, a work of art and noise blended to become a musical dream. This is my favorite album of all time. Let it become yours, too.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|It's pretty hard to one-up one of the best reviewed albums of the past two years, but much to my delight, Death Cab For Cutie has come very, very close.<br />While &quot;Plans&quot; may not have the overall flow of Transatlanticism, its scope, or is daring leaps of faith, &quot;Plans&quot; is still in my opinion the best released CD so far this year.<br />Ben Gibbard and co. still deliever what DCFC fans have loved about the West-coast group for years: haunting melodies, heart-felt and at many times brilliant lyrics, music you can easily get lost in. There are a couple tracks that leave something to be desired such as &quot;Summer Skin&quot; and &quot;Someday You Will Be Loved&quot;. But then again, Gibbard has written some of the best music of his career on this LP. &quot;Marching Bands of Manhattan&quot; is as great an opener as &quot;New Year&quot; ever was and &quot;What Sarah Said&quot; may be the most powerful song you will ever hear. The best song on the whole disk however may just be &quot;Brothers on a Hotel Bed&quot; which will remind you of why these guys are taking the world by storm. &quot;Stable Song&quot;, which is a nice acoustic, mellow redo of &quot;Stability&quot; and is a great way to end the CD.<br />While &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; was mainly about distance and being apart from what means a lot to you, &quot;Plans&quot; continues that theme and gives us the answer that sometimes, even in spite of our best made plans, things can change, and things can go wrong. DCFC's first release on a major label discusses death and loss like very few bands could ever dream to do.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I am astounded to find so many people claiming Muse to be better than Radiohead.  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, 'Absolution' is an amazing album; the influences from classical music backed up by some great guitar riffs and even industrial is a mindblowing experience, especially in songs such as 'Butterflies and Hurricanes' and 'Apocolypse Please.' <br /> <br />But still not better than Radiohead. The singing in Muse is more automatic and cynical. Where's the soul? Perhaps it surpasses albums like 'Pablo Honey' and 'The Bends', but the newer stuff can't be beat. <br /> <br />Listen to Absolution for something musically advanced, palettable, and satisfying. It will never be as dark as 'Amnesiac; or 'Hail To the Thief'. (Which yes, I do believe it can be compared to.)  <br /> <br />Muse has yet to fully utilize the art of melodrama. The operatic ballads, while interesting and creative, sometimes feel a bit too out of place and almost forced. <br /> <br />Still, a great album overall. I strongly recommend it.
0446310786|4.0|In To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee has touched a nerve in American culture, a nerve that runs through our society even today. The characters she brings to life are memorable, and it's hard not to look back on them with affection.<br /><br />Still, if you're considering this book for an Advanced Placement English class or in preparation for one in the future, you should be aware that while the debate over whether this book is great literature continues, the AP Board has come down on the side of those who say it isn't. If you're looking for writing from the American South that is AP-worthy, I strongly recommend Flannery O'Connor or William Faulkner. Also worth a try is Eudora Welty.
0805079076|4.0|Amusing and informative, this book answers many of the questions about the origin of language ordinary readers may have. The general tone is that of a professor lecturing to a freshman audience in a linguistics course. It is witty and clever, but at times I found it too pedantic. Still, I think I got a lot out of the book, and it made me want to find out more about the subject.
0140177396|5.0|\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is such a wonderful little piece of fiction. Steinbeck is an absolute marvel in his use of imagery, and his ability to paint the lives of ordinary men in such bright colors is unparalled.<br />This book is short, but a gamut of emotions packs its pages. Not only is the reader exposed to anger and exasperation, but humor, despair, and a reintroduction to the human condition as well.<br />The characters of George and Lennie are classic, and in my opinion, can easily be compared with Fitzgerald's Nick Carraway and Jay Gatsby as far as memorability goes.<br />Steinbeck, undoubtedly, has written a slew of great works including \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Cannery Row,\\" but if ever there is a story you should read by this man, it is \\"Of Mice and Men.\\" Its simplicity alone is genius and there is a lot said about power and how it is abused and lorded over the weak.<br />Good things come in small packages...and for those high school kids out there who think it sucks...I've been there....Just give it a few years and you are likely to better understand its importance with age (and the same goes for \\"The Great Gatsby\\" while I'm on my soap box).
B00009MGGI|5.0|This trilogy lives up to the many awards it has garnered.  Ian Richardson is wonderful as Francis Urquhart--a first rate politician and evil manipulator, but one for whom you tend to root, nonetheless.  Both myself and my husband thoroughly enjoyed this series and were captivated from the very first episode.  I highly recommend this set for anyone who loves a bit of ruthless treachery, high-stakes political savvy, a bit of mystery and, of course, murder!

B00005Y228|5.0|I can't get enough of this CD!  I suggest listening to \\"In Your Eyes\\" and \\"Love Affair\\" if you are looking for some wonderful dance tracks.  \\"Give It To Me\\" did sound a little cheesy, but I didn't mid it after a while.  It also features some hits many have heard on the radio, including \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" and \\"Love At First Sight\\".
B0000508U6|5.0|This being Coldplay's first CD I found it to be suprisingly enjoyable.  They were new-commers (came from England) and the CD's sold!  I never really knew who they were until one day on an episode of Smallville I heard a part of \\"In My Place\\" (off of A Rush Of Blood To The Head) and I thought, wow.  The piano and the way the music melts together is great and there will always be a song on one of their CD's that will stick to you.  Just plainly a very good band that can make some great music.  Most people will recognize \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Trouble\\" off the CD. <br /> <br />
B0000047EC|1.0|First off, I have to say as much as I appreciate Pat Metheny's skill and talent, I never found him to be a very interesting  player .  This album just confirms that  assessment -- a crashing bore from note one. It's dull, pedantic, and extremely repetitive. A mismosh of wandering noodling that some may find sublime but I find aimless, trite and tedious.  As for Charlie Haden -- maybe it's me, but I just don't see what's so great about this guy.  He strikes me as a very average player.  This isn't BAD music, it's just weak.  Two over-rated musicians sleepwalking through uninspired compositions.
B000063K2W|4.0|Directed by George Cukor in 1939, from Clare Boothe Luce's satire of women's vicious and predatory nature in New York's upper class, The Women features a powerhouse cast of actresses, some only beginning long and distinguished careers. In this drama, a clique of society friends feeds off the gossip they learn from a manicurist in a nail salon. Sylvia Fowler, played superbly by Rosalind Russell, discovers, quite by accident, that Mary Haines's husband, Stephen, is having an affair with a shop girl who works behind the perfume counter at the ritzy department store where the friends shop. Crystal Allen (a pre-dark-eyebrow Joan Crawford) has set her sights on the wealthy Stephen, playing a masterful cat and mouse game of seduction. Mary (Norma Shearer), although brokenhearted, refuses to acknowledge the affair, hoping her husband will come to his senses. Wisely counseled by an astute mother, Mary is given two pieces of advice: \\"every man is prone to fall for the charms of a strange woman, bored by himself and his responsibilities\\" and \\"don't solicit advice from your girlfriends\\", because they will steer you toward divorce.<br /><br />Sylvia (Russell) rallies to Mary's defense, although she is the worst and most vicious gossip of them all. Visiting the perfume counter to give Crystal a hard time, Sylvia recognizes a like-minded spirit. Mary travels to Reno for a divorce, where she makes new friends, including Paulette Goddard, whose characters has stolen Sylvia Fowler's husband. When Mary and her new friends return to New York, Stephen has married Crystal, although she is already cheating on Stephen, her comeuppance on the horizon. With this group of women, soon more gossip begins, this time about Crystal and her secret affair. Eventually, all is made right between Mary and Stephen and Crystal is shown up for the conniving social-climber that she is. The dialog is snappy, the delivery a mile a minute, the gaggle of chattering ladies spiting out rapid-fire lines. The elegant Norma Shearer is perfect as the wronged woman, patient and long-suffering, but only to a point, when she stands up to the brittle and grasping Crystal. This is old Hollywood at its satirical best and most self-important, an upper-class drama with top screen stars, couture fashions, an upbeat score that is almost playful and the emotional tug-of-war between the heroine and the arch-villainess. In her diva-like superiority, Crystal's spits, \\"You noble wives and mothers bore the brains out of me.\\"<br /><br />This war of the titans generates a blistering satire on the affairs of women, in this case, wealthy New Yorker's whose days are spent in idle mischief. Bearing in mind that this movie was released in 1939, one line shocked me, inserted towards the end of the movie, as Mary's mother comforts her daughter after the divorce. She explains that the single life has its compensations: \\"Heaven knows it's marvelous to spread out in bed like a swastika!\\" Luan Gaines/2005.egant Norma Shearer is perfect as the wronged woman, patient and long-suffering, but only to a point, when she stands up to the brittle and grasping Crystal.

0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee really made the characters seem like real people. She gave each of the characters human like characteristics, which added to the feeling of the book. The fact that Atticus took up the case of a black man because he wanted to and not because he was forced to was also important. He did try to defend Jem even though the people in the town were mistreating him because of it. The book gives you a real feeling of how things happened back than. Overall it is a very good book and I would highly recommend it as a great reading book.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|A flutter of cape. The tinkle of a bottle down and ally. A flash of a dark omious figure, and then he's there, in front of you, behind you, above you, and your life of crime is now over. <br /> <br /> <br />This is Batman. This is the Batman, I, my Father, my Mother, My Fiancee, my Brother, and everyone I know has been waiting for. As a fan of the Comics, and of Paul Dini's masterpiece, Batman the Animated Series, I had high expectations of this film.  <br /> <br />I didn't particularly care for Burton's Batman, and I couldn't stand Batman Returns. Burton was always more interested in why the villians were the villians, and most of the screen time in both of his films are dedicated to showing us the Villians' origins. Well this movie does not have that problem. This is about Bruce's motivations. This is about a wounded Child, a monster set free by a murderer, and reigned in by self-disipline.  <br /> <br />   This is BATMAN:YEAR ONE done right. We see a young Bruce wrestle with the demons of his past, and finally realising that he can never fully exorsize them, he must control them, or they will control him. He has help in the the form of Michael Caine as Alfred, spot on and ego free. I was worried that Michael may be too big a name to play the butler. But Alfred is more the father in this than the Butler, and his worldly advice is always spot on. <br /> <br />Morgan Freeman plays Lucious Fox, Former CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and holder of all those ((if I may steal from Burton and Jack for a Moment)) \\"Wonderful Toys\\" Morgans has such a wonderful Twinkle in his eye every time he shows off a new toy, you are very very excited for the possibility. <br /> <br />Katie Holmes is a womderful Rachel. A grounded Love interest for Bruce, that keeps him centered on the past that was, and that which was happy. <br /> <br />The always Underated Liam Neeson is an excelent foil to Christian Bale. He proves that Youth and Speed do not trounce Age and Experience. <br /> <br />Ken Watanabe is awesome as Ra's Al Ghul. A vigillanty of the global Order. <br /> <br />Cillian Murphy makes the Scarecrow truely scarry. I was worried that he would just be silly, but I actually jumped in my seat during his scenes. <br /> <br />and Gary Oldman is just fantastic as Lt. Gordon. Not quite the confident ally of Batman yet, he is new to the scene, and is feling things out. <br /> <br />This film is dark. This is the Batman of the comic. There is no neon save the flickering light in the front of a pawn shop. There is nothing gothic other than the oppressive structures of Chicago, New York, and London ((all of which stood in or Gotham, and made me partial to the film from the get go, as a Chicago Filmmaker)) <br /> <br /> <br />This is Batman, respected, in the fore front, and learning what it is to be a Hero.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This is easily the best movie that I have seen all summer long.  I was expecting it to be a good movie, but I wasn't expecting a masterpiece that would get me thinking in the way it did.  The thing that most impressed me was (second from the acting) the way it sort of re-created the mood and feel of an old Alfred Hichcock movie, the soundtrack was even reminiscent of Psycho's a few times.  I bet it also wouldn't be much different of a movie if you switched your TV to B&W.  I wish I could, but I can't really rave about the story without giving too much away, so I'll go ahead and rave about Christian Bale.  I first saw him in Reign of Fire, and he didn't really impress me, just sort of the average British actor, but when I saw him in Equilibrium and American Psycho I was stunned.  I love the way he speakes in an American accent if you want to call it that.  If you've seen American Psycho, than you know how buff and perfect his body was for the roll of Patrick Bateman.  Well, imagine everything about his appearence in that movie, only opposite.  He dropped his weight down to 120 something pounds, that is dedication.  Another actor who I was glad to see was Michael Ironside who is able to play so well a terrifying villain, or a intimidating, yet really nice guy.  I can't say I knew any of the other actors, but they all did a great job.  If you enjoyed the likes of Fight Club, Identity, and Psycho, you'll probably enjoy this movie as it sort of combines all three into one awsome film.  Enjoy!
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is a pretty good cd if you like Coldplay's music. It is basically sticking to a similar sound they had on a Rush of Blood to the Head. Some songs sound a little spacey, others sound a little like they were meant for a cool night on some seculuded South Pacific island. I happen to like those kinds of softer sounds which is why I think this is a good cd all around.

0099478285|5.0|My first book by Ms. Woolf, and it was an amazing, surreal read. Orlando is a love story, a wonderful mess-up of gender and all the questions about love that gender provokes, and an ode to creativity.<br /><br />The story begins with Orlando as a romantic youth, lacking in wisdom, but not in appreciation of beauty and lust for life.  His vibrancy catches the eye of the elderly Queen Elizabeth, who then, falls in love with his beauty and graces him with a court appointment and takes it upon herself to protect him from the usual pains that would befall someone of his status.  [It is at this point, in the movie (with Tilda Swinton), that Queen Elizabeth (Quentin Crisp) cryptically tells him, \\"Do not fade.  Do not wither.  Do not grow old.\\"  I did not find this quote in the book, but the sentiment is the same.  There is a special immortal something about Orlando that others  recognize and he is doomed and blessed to tumble through the ages in one guise or another.]<br /><br />Orlando falls from the queen's grace when she spies him with one of the many girls he courts.  Three years after the queen's disapproval, Orlando finds himself madly in love with a Russian princess, who will not marry him.  He falls asleep heartbroken, only to awake 50 years later in a different role, as an aristocratic poet.  And so go Orlando's series of romances and heartbreaks.  After several failed romances and the seeming death of his beloved poetry, Orlando reawakens as a woman, without skipping a beat.  We then follow him/her through subsequent decades and see Orlando grow in wisdom and knowledge of love.  One could say that perhaps his womanly incarnation is what Fate has thrown at him in order for him to understand what it is to be on the other side of the mirror.  Yet in either form he is admired.<br /><br />It's an odd story and plotwise, difficult to track, which is perhaps besides the point.  Certainly full of humor.  The only contemporary author to whom I can compare it is Jeannette Winterson and her novel The Passion--she has a similar interest in characters and love, and an equal disregard for rules of space, time, and gender roles. Winterson may be our modern day Woolf.<br /><br />If you haven't read Orlando, and you are unsure, try the movie first.  It is what prompted me to read the book.  The production is gorgeous and Tilda Swinton is perfect as Orlando.  And when you decide to read the book, there's plenty to be discovered that the movie can't touch on--for instance the writing nuances and styles.  I'll be rereading it soon and I'm eager to see what I'll find in my second passing.el The Passion--she has a similar interest in characters and love, and an equal disregard for rules of space, time, and gender roles.

0440178002|2.0|...but I agree with the reviewer below (although not in his tone). Look, if you want to read a romance or an adventure book, then \\"Shogun\\" is fine. BUT, don't go around talking about how historically accurate it is without at least cross referencing some of the events. The late 16th centure was indeed an interesting time in Japanese history (the Sengoku period which introduced such heroes as Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Takeda Shingen, just to name a few). For some good historical fiction on the time, I would suggest \\"Taiko\\" by Eiji Yoshikawa (\\"Musashi\\" by the same author, is also quite nice, although its time is the early to mid 17th century). To claim, though, that this is the Japan of the period is absurd.  <br /> <br />Thus, my review is as follows: as far as action and romance goes, this is OK (although a bit long and tedious at times). If you want to learn about Japan (or China or Vietnam, all of which seem to be lumped into this single term \\"The Orient\\"), then I would suggest doing some more serious research into the matter.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is just an awesome thrash and metal album. Monstrously quick riffs, superb drumming, amazing solos, and even better singing from Dave than the earlier albums. Not my favorite album ever, but my favorite Megadeth album. This is worth buying just for Hangar 18, the best song on it, and Holy Wars. The extra tracks are worth it too, for the original song and the different takes on the classics. Comparing some of the solos of Chris Poland with Marty Friedman is fun, you can see what Marty added to Megadeth compared to what it had been. Personally, I don't care a whole lot for the notes from Dave in the CD booklets. They're pretty arrogant a lot of the time; in case you didn't know this was a great album that sold well, Mustaine tells you. If you like any type of metal, thrash, speed, anything, get this album. Megadeth's best offering, compares to pretty much anything else.

B0009HLDFU|1.0|Don't get me wrong: this is one of the best albums of the year, but boycott Sony's crappy anti-piracy merchandise. I bought this aware of the problems, but I still assumed I would be able to play it in iTunes or even WMP, but NOOOOO it comes with a web-browser jukebox in which you MUST play the album through. I was extremely irritated. Of course, I eventually found a way around it . . . but  iwon't list it here. You'll have to find it for yourself.
B0009X766Y|5.0|I don't care how many times I see this movie, every time brings immense enjoyment. Set in Chicago in the 1920s, Paul Newman and Robert Redford play two con artists who, with a gang of other pros put together by Newman, the mastermind, put a sting on a big shot Chicago gambler for a half million dollars. The story is perfect and unfolds flawlessly - it's just mysterious enough to keep us wondering while not being so much so that we can't follow it. The sets, costumes, and photography (by master Robert Surtees) are all done to perfection. Top notch entertainment from beginning to end.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Ghost Reveries is, hands down, the most gratifying album I've bought in years (and that includes other Opeth albums). Deliverance and Damnation, while good records, had me a bit worried because to me they seemed a little too simplistic and repetitive at times. I was praying that Opeth wasn't about to do a Metallica and start playing more and more simple music because they can write to save their lives (yeah you Metallica). However, this album was the answer to my prayers. <br />Overall, the music is thrilling and intoxicating. Per Wiberg's pianos and organs really add a subtle substance to the color of the music that compliments Opeth's expansive progressions. The guitar work is nothing short of amazing for its creativity and mastery of tone. For me, Opeth has always been a band that could redefine the way guitar can be played. Akerfeldt's vocals are better than every too. His growls are actually intelligible and his singing voice has come quite a long way in improvement from the days of Orchid (although I think he was still good back then). Lopez's drumming is tight and thoroughly creative. I suspect that he had a lot of influence over the very different styles found in songs like \\"Beneath the Mire\\" and \\"Atonement\\". Mendez's bass is a bit understated and more of a supportive presence under the guitars. And while this is typical for him on the albums, he's much more pronounced at live performances. <br />Anyone who's never heard an Opeth album before  could not pick a better time to start listening. There are treats for fans of insanely heavy music, acoustic melodies and even blues. There are many instances of progressive phrases along the lines of Dream Theatre but with an essence that only Opeth can create. I don't see how anyone who even remotely likes metal, rock or even trippy hippy music would not like this album. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
B000000OAL|4.0|Review no. 58. Originally released in 1973, this was, as most of you probably know Queen's debut effort. Simply just a good album rock catalog release. Loved the playing on this CD reissue. Key tracks happen to be the energetic opener \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", the ballad \\"Doing Alright\\", the rockin' \\"Great King Rat\\", \\"Liar\\" and \\"Seven Seas Of Rhye\\". A couple of bonus cuts are tagged on here. Good job, Hollywood Records.
B00000612Q|5.0|With Never a Dull moment, Rod starts from where he left off- every picture tells a story, and the result is stunning. More concise and lighter than his previous work, dull moment leaves behind a tight group of songs that stand the test of time. Though a lesser known album in the early canon, dull moment packs a punch right from the opening chords of true blue. Rod moves on easily through various styles and covers, from folk to straight ahead rock. Tracks like Los paraguayos and Italian girls are sure to please the uninitiated, as are the better known tracks. Classics like 'you wear it well' still sound great even after years of radio play. It is a rather short album, but well thought out and seems to touch every area of the listener's palate. Rod is a legend and dull moment demands to be revisted for its rightful place in musical history.
B000002MM8|3.0|I wanted to give a Christian's view of this CD: <br /> <br />Dead Can Dance seemed like the perfect artists, being world, ambient, unique, etc., for me, but when I purchased Into the Labyrinth, I gave it a few spins and no matter how \\"open\\" I kept my mind - and I have listened to some strange music - I could not shake off a feeling of dread and, well, evil.   <br /> <br />I did some online research and found that Gerrard became a member of RCI (regarded by some as a cult) not too long ago.  Perhaps that is the reason for this particular CD's slant, as compared to their earlier releases.  Either way, the last song, \\"How Fortunate the Man with None\\" - refers to God/gods.  Does this sound like someone who knows the Lord?     <br /> <br />Christians can appreciate secular music, but always need to use discernment.  <br /> <br />This review may not be popular, but I wish someone had warned me before \\"Into the Labyrinth\\" haunted my CD collection.  Now if only my conscience would allow me to sell it...

B00004Y6NV|5.0|I love this CD, but I like other Dire Straits albums a lot better <br />than this. Love over Gold, Making Movies, Brothers in Arms, On <br />the Night, Dire Straits debut, & Live at the BBC. The best songs <br />would be hits such as Calling Elvis, The Bug, & Heavy Fuel which <br />all of these would be my favorites. My other favorites is My <br />Parties, & On Every Street number. I totally love the epic, Planet of New Orleans as much as Telegraph Road, Tunnel of Love, <br />& Money for Nothing. Then i like the slower songs such as the <br />great guitaring You and Your Friend. Fade to Black is a jazzy <br />song. And then I like When It Comes to You as my only country <br />song that I like. I think this CD is great, Money for Nothing <br />is simular to Heavy Fuel, Walk of Life is simular to the Bug. <br />It is highly and strongly recommended and I prefer you to buy this album along with 4 from Foreigner.

B00005JNTX|5.0|I am not a Frank Miller fan, and in fact had never heard of him or his \\"Sin City\\" books.  However, while flipping through the on-flight entertainment choices on a flight from Houston to Amsterdam, I happened across this jewel.  The sheer visual impact was spellbinding - I couldn't stop watching!  While I did find myself a bit self conscious at times  viewing such outlandish violence while my fellow passengers occasionally passed by, I didn't feel self conscious enough to change the channel.  In any case, I will make this part of my personal collection.
B000AADYYO|5.0|The opening track starts with eight slow plucks at clean guitar strings, instantly providing the faithful Opeth fan echoes of their last masterful creation, 2003's spellbinding \\"Damnation\\".  Then, at the song's eighth second, the Swedes unleash their trademark attack upon the senses: thunderous guitars and singer/songwriter Mikael &#506;kerfeldt's otherworldly growls.  Any illusions that Opeth have softened are dispelled in the ten minutes that follow.<br /><br />From here, \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" revisits several melodic themes that Opeth have explored before, all revering the quintet's vigorous energy.  The opening riffs, bludgeoning and powerful, are reminiscent of \\"The Leper Affinity\\" (off \\"Blackwater Park\\").  The softer middle section, with acoustic guitars layering &#506;kerfeldt's harmonizing sounds like \\"The Moor\\"'s similar section (off \\"Still Life\\").  Finally, when the intensity returns, the double-bass drum melodies and unconventional guitars echo \\"By the Pain I See in Others\\" (off \\"Deliverance).<br /><br />\\"The Grand Conjuration\\", the album's first \\"single\\" has everyone talking.  It is what \\"A Fair Judgment\\" would have sounded like if it were to have been possessed by the devil.  The main riff is memorable, but unfortunately overused for a 10-minute song.  Opeth's musical ADD, which is what has made the band such metal icons, was discarded in the songwriting process for this heavy piece, which I think jeopardizes the song's lasting power (however, I might be alone in this ruling).<br /><br />The song is also sandwiched in between two gems, the all-acoustic and hyper-melancholic \\"Hours of Wealth\\" and \\"Isolation Years\\".  The first of which begins with guitars that would make Days of the New's Travis Meeks envious, followed by an urban, piano-driven section, whose tormenting vocals may remind us of \\"To Bid You Farewell\\" (off \\"Morningrise\\").  The song is perfect for the desperate man in a closing tavern with such lines as \\"Looking through my window, seem to recognize all the people passing by - but I'm alone and far from home - nobody knows me\\".  For a band known for its darkness and intensity, Opeth shine in tranquil splendor.<br /><br />Despite all the similarities, the album is hardly a clone.  Unlike many metal bands today, Opeth commands the genre in which they play and are far from using a tired formula.  \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\", a faster, less intense track, illustrates Opeth's newest innovation: integrating keyboards into heavier pieces.  Although &#506;kerfeldt (under Stephen Wilson's wing) used pianos and mellotrons in their last two albums, they weren't integrated into heavier songs and were found sparingly and experimentally.  In \\"Ghost Reveries\\", new fifth member Per Wiberg adds a flute-like sound to \\"Ghost of Perdition\\", a funky twang to \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\", a middle-eastern melody to \\"Beneath the Mire\\" and a melancholic ambience to \\"Isolation Years\\".<br /><br />Although this album wasn't produced by Porcupine Tree songwriter Stephen Wilson (as Opeth's past three albums have been), you can still feel the British prog-rocker's influence in the mix.  The vocal arrangements at the sixth minute of \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" sound shockingly similar to PT's \\"Shallow\\" (off \\"Deadwing).  \\"Atonement\\" hast the repetitive, psychedelic atmosphere that Wilson and company craft with every album, and the soothing, bluesy guitar solo at the end of \\"Hours of Wealth\\" is identical to &#506;kerfeldt's solo in PT's \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" (also off \\"Deadwing\\").<br /><br />The album is not perfect (as no Opeth album is), with such erratic and scatterbrained pieces as \\"Reverie / Harlequin Forest \\" and some weak points in \\"Beneath the Mire\\".  Maybe I'm the one at fault - maybe I haven't yet captured the technical brilliance involved.  But the album more than makes up for these faults.  Opeth have proven themselves to possess metal's Hand of Midas.  Having done no wrong in their 8-album, 11-year career, they follow thispattern of excellence with \\"Ghost Reveries\\".  Hail, hail.<br /><br />See also: Opeth - \\"Damnation\\", \\" Blackwater Park\\", \\"Deliverance\\"pattern of excellence with \\"Ghost Reveries\\".  Hail, hail.<br /><br />See also: Opeth - \\"Damnation\\", \\" Blackwater Park\\", \\"Deliverance\\"

However, it is quite dull and dismal.<br /><br />The story revolves around the Joad family, a group who has been uprooted from their home and decides to move to California where there are oranges and opportunities. They endure hardships including death, poverty and prejudice. The scenes are filled with dirt and barren landscapes. It is hard to like the family because they're absolutely pathetic and it is hard not to like them either for the same reason. One just rolls along the story with them not caring much what happens or what doesn't happen.<br /><br />The book is full of symbols that are presented for the reader to interpret any way they'd like. Steinbeck used these symbols to put forth his points about humanity in a subtle way so that one is not overwhelmed. One symbol is the dust that creates a haze over the world. It foreshadows the discomfort and irritation of a new life and obliterates view of the past. The wind that blew the dust pushed the family toward California in hopes of a better life. The highway symbolizes the journey taken by the families toward California. It is the progression of life, the never-ending struggle that all must endure. The grapes from the title of the book were referenced in a scene in which they were crushed to starve the Okies. The juice from these grapes symbolizes the blood that was shed while fighting injustice. In Christianity, grape juice and wine are used in communion as the blood of Christ. The wealthy squeezed the grapes to expel the juices into the streets so that the common people had no access to it, preventing religion and good from the migrants.<br /><br />Overall, this book employs tools of great writers and is certainly historically important. However, it is difficult for one to want to read this sort of book if it is not entertaining. This void is the book's major weakness.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I think this album is really good.  It isn't as driving as Transatlanticism and is a little bit more mellow.  Gibbard's lyrics are awesome, honest, and pretty abrasive at times.  The rhythms and bass lines are Death Cab-esque.  The album doesn't stick out as well as We Have the Facts... but it still is an awesome album with plenty of moving Death Cab ballads.  Plans is a must buy.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I saw this movie once (borrowed from a friend) and thought it was good, and yes I had heard all the Quentin Tarantino hype. I felt that I wasn't content by only watching it once so I watched it again. Now I being to think it was an incredible movie. Soon I brought the QT collection and not I have seen the movie two more times, and I will soon watch it again. Then you might wonder what's so special about it, perhaps even after you've seen it? Well for me it's the special feeling of Hong Kong nostalgia mixed with perhaps the best soundtrack. I've ever heard (the ending sequence with the pan flute music beats everything up to date), hell I even bought the soundtracks of both movies, and I have never bought a soundtrack before. Be careful though if you don't like blood very much because there is a LOT. Yes I think the just because the hyped Taranito movie it makes it even better I admit that, it gives it like an aura making it even better.
B000AADYYO|4.0|4 and a half stars for Opeth, 5 stars compared to everyone else.<br /><br />I think one of the hardest things to do as a music fan is accept, right off the bat, a new album from your favorite artist.<br /><br />I'll admit, when I first heard Ghost Reveries a couple of weeks ago on a floating copy, my heart sunk.<br /><br />The band that had single-handedly created a metal fan of me again, after so many years of ignorance that there was a scene beyond that of the pitiful surface, had gone soft when I had heard from the horse's mouth it was going to pummel harder than before.<br /><br />Since my first listen, I've read a lot about Opeth, and their musical influences.  Knowing the extent to which these guys, Mikael in particular, are influenced by 70s progressive acts like Camel, I listened to the album with another perspective a couple of days ago, and then again today when I forked over the money for this much anticipated release.<br /><br />The progressive elements/songwriting are as evident as ever here.  The addition of Wiberg as a fulltime ivory tickler offers a range of tones from funk, to psychedelic, and yes, at times, to the spirit of black metal.  I give this addition a resounding thumbs up.<br /><br />As usual, acoustic/ambient passages are interwoven with themes of intense aggression and amplification.  Particularly to my liking is the opening of the album.  Though long acoustic passages into heavy passages like in the intro. of the Still Life classic \\"The Moor\\" must be appreciated, I love when Opeth starts a song soft, but instead of stretching the passage out, sneaks in a suckerpunch to floor the listener.  The rest of \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" plays like a classic Opeth tune, but, unfortunately, the transtion to the first acoustic passage, much like many of the transitions on the rest of the album, seems forced.  I just don't hear them flowing as well as they did on Still Life, Morningrise, Blackwater Park, and even Deliverance.<br /><br />Of course, the acoustic passage itself delivers, and I love the chant during this part of this sure to be crowd favorite.  I can only imagine the scene as Mikael growls \\"Ghost of Perdition\\" at the crushing end of this album opener.<br /><br />\\"The Grand Conjuration\\" is another favorite, being the fan of the track \\"Deliverance\\" that I am.  I enjoy listening to Opeth explore the realm of progressive music through other avenues than simply multi-passaged, epic songwriting.  Here they do it with punishing, dynamic rhythms, and an Opeth staple I find missing on the first half of the album: brilliant layering of countless tracks, especially guitars.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Beneath the Mire\\" and \\"Atonement\\" border on the progressive hard-rock line most of the time, and though they are not my favorite tracks, you can't knock Opeth for the still superior songwriting, and the fact that many bands that influenced Mikael sounded more like this than metal.<br /><br />\\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" is another punishing track with a memorbale riff/section coming at the 3:00 mark, which leads into, actually, an impressively smooth acoustic passage.  After this though, the song fails to remain memorable, highlighting another aspect of this album that fails to put it right in the league of my Opeth favorites.  Sure, I hear the doom influences mentioned here on Amazon at the end of this song, and understand the purpose of it all; it simply doesn't crush me the way other Opeth offerings do.<br /><br />Other comments aside, I cannot end this review without also stating how much I agree that the vocals on this album are mindblowing, and I would like to add that the lyrics are so haunting, vivid, and frigid, that I literally got chills the first time I was privileged enough to listen to the album and read the lyrics at the same time.  Mikael does an impressive job of conjuring dark images which appear immediately vivid in the mind.  Usually, I don't even care about lyrics, what with the uninspired drivel aboutdown with religion, in with Satanism, which is not...well, oh we sound dumb, and the overly-gory lyrics strung together by randomly selecting words from a surgical textbook.  Opeth, though, comes through in this department as well as many others, as they assert once more that, no matter what label we're on, no matter what the critics, and even the fans, say, we bow to no conventions, we are unrivaled in our songwriting, and if this sounds like the description of a heavy band, you still have no idea how badly we're going to crush your skull.ed drivel about down with religion, in with Satanism, which is not...well, oh we sound dumb, and the overly-gory lyrics strung together by randomly selecting words from a surgical textbook.

B0002X314C|5.0|I'd say this is the male version of Alica Keys. John Legends voice is not all that bad he sounds really nice. One of his songs is a message talking about the problems families go through I saw his music video husband and wife fighting over the kid. I didn't think John Legends cd would have a (Parential Adversiory: Explicit Lyrics) logo on cause his music doesn't sound like he would say a lot of cursing not that I'm complaining.
079073639X|5.0|When we saw \\"Sphere\\" in the theaters, my entire party instantly ushered it into our select pantheon of movies so awful that they could evoke a perverse nostalgia many years later. And yet watching it for a second time recently, I was able to forgive its Hollywood clumsiness and embrace it as a genuinely moving science fiction tale. <br /> <br />The unkinking of its twisty plot is one of the pleasures of the film, so I'll skip that. I'll just note that it touches on many of the great themes of Art - forgiveness, faith, responsibility - in an endearingly geeky-but-earnest way. [The ending is wrongly considered disappointing for the same reason that people think that of \\"The Shining\\" - it is too bold a departure from genre conventions.] And the high-powered cast - Hoffman, Jackson, Coyote, Schreiber, and the still under-rated Sharon Stone - all give fully committed performances.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|The first time I caught DCFC live, I was in the middle of a complex and prickly legal situation. But when I witnessed the live splendor they bring to their performances, it was like they stuck a pipe bomb into my head. <br /> <br />Most of us know that DCFC has been an independent music staple for years (but not the kind of staple that you use to bind papers, the other kind), so it was a little unsettling to learn they had jumped to a major label. Well, have no fear, because the only fear is the fearful fear you fear fear fear! <br /> <br />This record serves notice that, while Nirvana may be no more, Pearl Jam may be no less. Pavement, too. And Primus. Such evocative images are conjured with the wind, that terrifying lies wait on the other side of the crossing point of light. <br /> <br />My best pal, Jerry, (you might remember him from where you knew him from, if you knew him or not) is often critical of bands that try too hard not to try hard enough. DCFC, on the other hand, is an acronym for this band's name, which is Death Cab For Cutie, and NOT Deaf Cab For Cutsie.  <br /> <br />All in all, you can't be disappointed in this very impressive effort, lest you should reap the whirlwind of them. Cocoa ghosts in the well. <br /> <br />Boris Norris
B00005JN5X|4.0|First off, I liked The Brothers Grimm.  In particular, I found the blend of fantasy and horror and the creepy production with moving trees and the Mirror Queen were fantastic.     The film is set in German during the Napoleonic wars and concerns Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, con artists pulling off fake exorcisms from village to village.  The different between the brothers is that Jacob (Heath Ledger) believes in things magical and Wilhelm (Matt Damon) is a pragmatist.  The bothers and their two partners in crime have a great scam going until they are arrested by a French general (played by Jonathan Pryce) and are sent to a cursed German village where children are being mysteriously abducted to prove whether they can actually battle spirits as they claim.    In the village, they find Angelika (Lena Headley) whose sisters have been claimed by the unknown forces in the forest.  Angelike knows the forest and the evil the lives there and guides Wilhelm and Jacob to a mysterious tower that is the home of the Mirror Queen (played by Monica Bellucci).     Like many of Terry Gilliam's films there are moments of near slap-stick comedy followed by scenes of horror or the fantastic.  Mixed into the film are hints of well-known fairy tales, such as Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel.  One of the abducted girls is wearing a red cape and two children searching in the woods are dropping breadcrumbs.  This film is stunning for its production design and special effects.  The forest is fittingly forbidding and the story holds your attention throughout the film. I have read a review that suggested that the film was difficult to follow but neither I nor my wife had any such difficulties. Matt Damon makes a good Wilhelm Grimm but Heath Ledger is a passionate Jacob as he makes his case for believing in magic and that the curse of the woods can be lifted.  Jonathan Pryce was a slimy villain but I didn't care for his accent or the foppish way that he approached his role. Lean Headleywas good as the determined Angelika.  If you like fantasy films and Terry Gilliam in particular, then you should see The Brothers Grimm.
B00005JNQA|3.0|If you haven't seen it yet, you sould be warned that it isn't worth buying. Here's why :  - It is quite long and very predictable (audiences who like surprises or suspense will definitely be disappointed)  - Even if she is a very talented actress, Nicole \\"Chanel 5\\" Kidman is out of place in the middle of an African guerrilla.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth is my favorite band, so this review is going to be incredibly biased in their favor.  On the Lamentations DVD, Mikael Akerfeldt warned that they wanted to try something borderline black metal on the next cd, to push it in a direction they had been going toward but hadn't really entered into yet.  If you loved that idea, then you'll be pleased with the doom metal influences I hear on this album, especially on the song Beneath the Mire.  If you were turned off by the idea of black metal, and want only to hear the \\"progressive\\" and more melodic side of Opeth, you won't be disappointed either.  The acoustic guitar, acoustic piano, and clean vocals sections on this cd are outstanding.  I really think this is Mikael's best vocal performance of any of their albums yet.  Hours of Wealth is a fantastic softer song... very broken-down, and very beautiful.<br /><br />The cd is printed black on black, and you can look at the dark and ghostly artwork.  This is definitely indicative of the dark musical content of the album.  It definitely plays on black metal themes, such as enslavement and haunting... and with lyrics such as \\"The eyes of the devil / Fixed on his sinners.\\"  But at the same time, there is this overwhelming sense of regret - of dying alone and in darkness.<br /><br />Working with a different producer and a different guitar-tuning gave this album a different mood than some of their other albums, but it is still instantly recognizable as Opeth.  It has that beautiful blend of lush harmonies, intricate melodies, phenomenal drumming, and of course the contrast of the deep growling death metal vocals and the type of rhythms that pound into your chest.<br /><br />This album is an absolute triumph.  I wanted to end by recommending the best song to listen to, but I realized that they are all my favorites. I have nothing negative to say about any of them.  So I'll leave it at this:  Enjoy this one.  Music this good is a rarity.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I've lost faith in Dream Theater after this album.  The lyrics are pretty bad and the melodies are awful.  This music has no heart.  Dream Theater's lost their soul that they had back in the day. <br /> <br />The second track is the corniest stupidest slow song ever, and the singing sucks in it.  Sample of the lyrics: \\" Life is short So learn from your mistakes And stand behind The choices that you make.\\"  Those lyrics suck. <br /> <br />The final track Octavarium sounds a lot like the intro to Pink Floyd's \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" but it doesn't stir up any emotions.  There's no suspense.  \\"I Walk Beside You\\" sounds exactly like U2. <br /> <br />I could complain more, but you get the idea.  If you want the best Progressive Rock ever to walk the face of the Earth, listen to Pain of Salvation (start off with Entropia, their Debut, and work your way up from there).  The leader puts any vocalist to absolute shame (maybe except Jeff Buckley), stands up there as an amazing guitarist, amazing lyricist, and amazing songwriter.  I can't even begin to describe how awesome their music is.
B0007M22TI|4.0|This is an excellent vocal and instrumental concert. <br /> <br />Think which disk you want to use...there is a DVD and a CD. <br /> <br />(Now that I've watched the DVD show of these several ladies performing, I wish I had the CD to play over and over in my car, not that I can afford much gasoline anymore.  Maybe I would just sit in the car when it cools down in the evenings and listen to the CD.) <br /> <br />The musical experience is excellent, and almost everyone will enjoy this album. <br /> <br />Dan H <br />Houston, tX
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I really liked Gavin DeGraw when I first heard him on the radio, however, as with most CD's, I expected to be disappointed with a good portion of the CD.  To my surprise, I absolutely love this CD.  With the exception of ONE song, I love every other song.  If you liked his first songs, \\"I don't wanna be\\" and \\"Chariot\\", you'll LOVE this CD too!  I have only listened to the bonus CD once, but it's great as well!
0767817478|5.0|I am a really big fan of the Japanese Godzilla (or Gojira, in the original movies), so when I saw that there was going to be an American remake of the movie, I knew that I just had to see it...  Unfortunately, I never got around to it.  However, shopping in Wal-Mart one day, I finally got the DVD and went home and watched it.  This is definitely the best movie of the entire Godzilla series.  It is superbly directed by Roland Emmerich and produced by Emmerich and Dean Devlin, and Matthew Broderick shines as the unfortunately geeky scientist Nick Tatopoulos.  As the movie progresses, you can tell, unfortunately, that the monster isn't actually Godzilla, the only bad part of the movie. Also, the DVD has some kick-ass special features, including the awesome music video \\"Heroes\\" by the Wallflowers, and some really cool behind-the-scenes action.<br /><br />Overall, a definite 5/5... Unfortunately, this reviewing system only goes up to five stars, or my review would been so much higher.  Oh, well.  If you liked the original Godzilla movies, then this one is sure to please.
0743487583|4.0|\\"Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me...  I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend.  Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\\"  This was said by none other than M. Frankenstein's monstrous creation.  To me this quote sums up one of the most important themes in the book.  This theme being that all life is very difficult to deal with, but we still strive to live even if times are very hard.  It also throws up the question:  Are we born pure and good?  Because the monster says that when created he was all about being a good man, but now that he is miserable he is a bad person.  Mary Shelley wrote this book on a dare from Lord Byron in 1816.  This was supposed to be a ghost story, even thought to me it doesn't really seem like a ghost story, but more of a story about playing god, and about life's hardships.  Two of her daughters died during infancy, only one son survived.  Her husband drowned while sailing in 1822.  Mary Shelley died at the age of 53 in 1851.  As you can see her life was full of hardships, and loneliness. This makes a lot of sense because if you read Frankenstein you get a sense of horrid loneliness throughout the entire novel.  Emotionally this book plays a toll on pity for M. Frankenstein as well as the monster.  No one is happy for more than a page or two in this book, and during this rut of happiness they are constantly nagged by something in the back of their mind.  It is a very good story and has a lot of very good points about life in it, but the book leaves you feeling...cold and alone.
B000002LBH|5.0|These are the songs that saved your life if you were a Smiths fan in the 80s.  While I've tried to avoid compilation albums out of a misguided sense of purity for the Morrissey/Marr oeuvre, my resolve has eroded over the years, and I only recently bought Louder Than Bomb.  I've been missing out.   <br /> <br />\\"Sing Me To Sleep\\" and \\"Back to the Old House\\" are gorgeously sad as only Morrissey can be.  \\"Ask\\" is the Morrissey/Marr collaboration at its most representative, with shiny guitar riffs that make your head want to explode driving Moz's weird, morose lyrics.  \\"Panic\\" and \\"Shoplifters of the World\\" are clever to the point of philosophy.  And what other pop singer would use the refrain \\"In the midst of life we are in debt, et cetera.\\"   <br /> <br />Call me morbid, call me pale, but Morrissey's melancholic worldview is seductive to the point of addiction. He's the thinking man's teenage suicide grown middle age, and arguably the greatest lyricist in rock who was lucky enough to hook up (if only briefly) with arguably the greatest pop guitarist. <br /> <br />Only a record executive could not like this album.

B0009X75RO|5.0|This is a fantastic musical. From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.<br /><br />The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.<br /><br />Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.<br /><br />In the jail, Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.<br /><br />The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter. What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.<br /><br />The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Cell Block Tango\\". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, \\"When You're Good To Mama\\" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.<br /><br />The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, \\"Mister Cellophane\\", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" number and his tap dancing.<br /><br />I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for \\"Best Picture\\". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud. Bravo!hem.

B00005JNQA|3.0|The Interpreter, directed by Sydney Pollack is a good movie with better acting (albeit a mumbled jumbled accent by Nicole Kidman who plays Silvia) and an excellent storyline. <br /> <br />Yes Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn are unbelievably good actors, but her accent was pathetic.  She had lived in Africa and in America so I guess it should have been mixed, but this was strange. <br /> <br />As a suspense thriller, it's excellent although for me, it could have been about a half hour shorter.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|The best record of 2005. Yes, just a month ago I would have told you my favourite record of 2005 would be a tie between Weezer's Make believe and Teenage Fanclub's Man Made. But well, this is it..... I haven't heard songs of this calibre come from bands in AGES. (The last being the Art-Rock of the Smashing Pumkins in the 90s). Ive had the pleasure of seeing the Arcade Fire perform live, and well the Band members are so talented that they just keep changing their line up, (with all members constantly trading their instruments after each song). <br />The songs are all great, especially the \\"neighbourhood\\" songs, with the first song maybe being the best (GREAT build up) <br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves music.

B00005JNTX|4.0|When I first saw that commercial for this film I wanted to see it more than any film ever. The Crow is my favorite comic and movie, so I was not afraid of the gore or violence, although it must be said that I hate Tarentino. I could barley sit through Kill Bill, and I vowed never to see another one of his films again.<br /><br />But the visuals! I wished \\"The Crow\\" could have been done like this! When Sin City came out I read a review that said the plot sucked and the acting was horrible and every woman was a whore. I said I wouldn't go to it in the theater.<br /><br />I watched it last night, and it was amazing. Some people only want to watch a film that is going to take them out of their lives - or make them feel better about them. Make no mistake, that is not the point of sin city. this movie is set in it's own world, in it's own time. I loved the plots, but I love revenge. One review said that the gore and killings seemed pointless at times. I did not find this to be true at all. Ever death in this movie served a purpose.<br /><br />The acting was awesome, which is something because I can't imagine how hard it must have been. I would have to say my favorite part of the film is when Jessica Alba jumps off the bar and kisses Bruce Willis, my heart lifted and I smiled. Love - in the midst of all that is evil and horrifying - was beautiful and believeable.<br /><br />I'm 24, and a woman. And I loved this movie.
0743455967|5.0|A good book, plenty of wit and wisdom. Loses some steam in the second third, just to gather more of it for the last third when it shines again. Reading it you will have fun and learn one thing or two about writing. By the way, about living too.<br /><br />Go for it.
B00008EY7S|4.0|This vintage John Carpenter film was made in collaboration with Debra Hill, who with Carpenter was responsible for the runaway success of \\"Halloween\\". When \\"The Fog\\" was first released, it was met with a fairly lukewarm reception. It has since gone on to achieve some acclaim, though it has never reached the heights of commercial success touched upon by \\"Halloween\\", though, then again, few films have.<br /><br />\\"The Fog\\" is a highly atmospheric ghost story. The ghosts manifest themselves on the stroke of midnight, as the fishing village of Antonio Bay gets ready to celebrate its centennial. As the midnight hour rolls in, so does an unearthly fog that begins to engulf the whole town. It is a fog that enshrouds of the ghosts of those whose ship was lured to the rocky coast, only to find itself dashed to bits on the rocks, causing all aboard to plummet to the nether regions of Davy Jones' locker. These ghosts are now hell bent on seeking revenge for their fate on the inhabitants of Antonio bay.<br /><br />The special effects in the film are excellent, as is the musical score composed by none other than John Carpenter himself. This is for the most part a subtle, creepy film, highlighted by a stellar cast. If you are looking for a blood and gore slasher film, this is not the film for you. If, however, you enjoy a terse, tightly written script, as well as a pulse pounding musical score, then you will enjoy this highly atmospheric, ghost story. I originally saw this film in the theatre when it was first released and still remember the effectiveness of the fog rolling across the huge silver screen and the pulse pounding, musical score, which was such an excellent accompaniment to the film. Time has not diminished its power.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A great sci-fi story but more than sci-fi.  This had great character development.  I have not seen a crew since Star Trek (original cast) that I cared about and loved to see interact together.  After watching this series you will be begging for more.  I was!!!!!
B00028HBKM|4.0|What more can be said about this movie? It has become a symbol of adoring love for so many (and judging from the spitefully pornographic scribblings of a few \\"reviewers\\" also one of intense hatred).<br /><br />All of us who were raised in Christian households, who went to Catholic schools have heard and read the words: \\"scourging\\" and \\"crucifixion.\\" We've seen re-enactments of these evils in Passion plays, we also watched them acted out in previous movies on the Life of Jesus. But it took Mel Gibson and a fantastic actor like Jim Caviezel to graphically display the horror of what these truly were. Some people call this movie disgusting, some call it a gorefest. Well, that is what Gibson intended to film. Scourging went beyond punishment, it is the rendering of the victim into a symbol of broken and torn submission. Crucifixion displays the victim as a symbol for all our various fears of death and pain. A man crucified was a man who was bound, broken, bleeding, slowly suffocated and totally helpless to the fangs and beaks, claws and talons of every nearby carrion eater. Gibson forces us (the spoiled and the complacent) to witness this. I thank Gibson for such a realistic display of barbarity and evil for he shows us what we all are truly capable of doing.<br /><br />As for all those Chicken Littles in the Jewish community who feared we were going to see this film, then exit the movie theatres and go on a pogrom spree, they owe Mel Gibson a much deserved apology.
0753819317|4.0|When eleven-year-old Daniel Sempere awakens early one morning, screaming, because he has suddenly forgotten the face of his deceased mother, his devoted father comforts him. As dawn breaks, Daniel's father, a bookseller, takes him on his first visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a secret, maze-like library which preserves books \\"no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time.\\" Each person who visits must adopt a book, guaranteeing that it will never disappear, and when Daniel sees The Shadow of the Wind, he knows it \\"had been waiting for me there for years, probably since before I was born.\\" Captivated by this book by Julian Carax, Daniel tries to find out more about its mysterious author and locate additional novels, but he discovers that some other unknown seeker is also searching for Carax's books--in order to burn them.<br /><br />Lovers of the Gothic romance will be handsomely rewarded by the action-filled plot, as a sensitive and loving young boy comes of age while trying to unravel the mysteries associated with the elusive Julian Carax. A ghostly apparition in the misty lamplight, a faceless man who seems to have an inordinate interest in Daniel, a sadistic police inspector, and an incarnation of the devil himself all materialize as Daniel begins his search for information about Carax. Heavy, sensual imagery creates a sense of foreboding, while night-time mists, storms, and winter cold add atmosphere to sensational scenes and coincidences. A mysterious photograph, letters which go astray, false identities, an abandoned mansion with a sobbing ghost, a matricide, an evil stepfather, thwarted love, mysterious disappearances, revenge which never dies, and murder most foul all complicate the action. The evil characters are truly villainous, Daniel and his father are truly virtuous, and the women whom Daniel and Julian Carax love are pure and true of heart.<br /><br />Though the novel offers a good escape, it is almost six hundred pages long. Extensive background information for virtually all the characters (and even a house) gives more information than the reader really needs, and many scenes could be compressed. Occasionally, the mood is broken by mild profanity and bathroom humor. This romance does achieve more relevance than some others, however, by being directly connected to the world of books, with a setting that reflects the political climate of Spain after the Civil War and World War II. The characters are memorable, if relatively uncomplicated, and the parallels between Daniel's coming-of-age and the story of Julian Carax offer some sense of universality to this otherwise sensational melodrama.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Joe Walsh's new song about his battle with alcoholism is worth the price of the DVD. The performances are excellent, the singing flawless as always. The Eagles are the soundtrack for the 1970s and 1980s, like the Beatles were for the 1960s. There is a lot more Eagles here, and a lot less \\"other musicians\\" as on \\"Hell Freezes Over.\\" This is mostly just the Eagles (although I must say I still miss Don Felder), the way only the Eagles can play and sing.

B0000021RB|5.0|The band Chicago, fresh out of the gate, champing at the bit, and straining at the reins was a wonder to behold. In many ways, this album is their best, born before fame and the cares of pop stardom took their toll on nerves and egos. CTA shows the band as musically competent, but with a ferocity, inventiveness, looseness, daring, hunger and depth of feeling that sadly steadily eroded over the next half-dozen albums.<br /><br />I first heard this album in the early seventies as I started high school. Back then, I was fascinated by the big hits - \\"Questions 67 and 68,\\" \\"Beginnings,\\" \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" But now I find myself enjoying the rest of the album as well or even more. The long guitar solos and clockwork jamming of \\"Listen\\" and \\"Poem,\\" and even (but only occasionally) the very free-form guitar of \\"Free Form Guitar.\\" Given that shortness of Terry Kath's career, this album is an eerily prescient memorial to his phenomenal skill.<br /><br />I love everything about the album - it's big pop sound, its complexity (\\"Introduction\\" is one of the tightest and most complicated rock compositions I have ever heard), its energy, and its politics. \\"Liberation,\\" seamlessly incorporating the chant \\"The Whole World is Watching\\" from the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention, still has the power to roil this old radical's blood. Listen to the album over and over, focusing on Danny Seraphine's kaleidoscopic drumming, or Peter Cetera's melodic bass lines, or Terry's ornamental guitar lines. There is so much going on here that a cursory listen just will not do.<br /><br />An incredible beginning for a band that is still filling halls with audiences eager to relive old standards.
B0006L16N8|4.0|At first this cd was just ehh, however as the time went by this cd has grew into one of my favorite cds, the only reason i gave it a 4 just because it took a while. X & Y is great, yet doesnt offer the the catchiness and easy listening that AROBTTH offered. Favorite Tracks have to be \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" \\"Square One\\" \\"A message\\"..... There all my favorites. This CD is just incredible and i highly urge you to buy it. Heres track by track off this awesome album.    1 - Square One - 10/10 - probably the heavy track on the album, great way to start off similiar to the heaviness of Politik opener on AROBTTH.    2 - What If - 8/10 - great song, love the verse and the chorus took awhile to appreciate becomming one of my favorites.     3 - White Shadows - 8/10 - Very Catchy Tune solid verse followed by an upbeat solid chorus.    4 - Fix You - 9/10 - Slow incredible song that picks up tempo at the end making a Coldplay classic. This ending reminds me of the ending of Amsterdam.    5 - Talk - 7/10 - my personal lowpoint of the album but still a descent song.    6- X & Y - 8/10 - solid song, the chorus is very relaxing and really pleasing to listen to.    7 - Speed of Sound - 10/10 - Great song love the Bridge. Very solid first single of the album.    8 - A Message - 9/10 - Love this song really catchy great uplifting chorus.    9 - Low - 8/10 - like the musicwork during the chorus reminds me like the chorus for \\"A Rush Of Blood to the Head\\"     10 - Hardest Part - 7/10 - not a personal favorite though i could see why people would enjoy this song b/c of its relative catchiness.    11 - Swallowed in the Sea - 11/10 - Best song on the album reminds me of the Scientist, the lyrics are kind of odd but the song is just impeccable.    12 - Twisted Logic - 9/10 - very good song very powerful chorus. Solid way to end off the Album.    Buy this CD its a great buy b/c its a cd you'll never wanna stop listening to.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This is another fantastic album by death cab for cutie. the last song is the stable song which is the revamped and shorter version of Stability off of the Stability EP. This is also their first album off of their new record label, Atlantic Records. At first I was a little hesitant to hear the new album on a new label, but the new death cab  album is so fresh and so clean.  <br />My favorate tracks were I Will Follow You Into The Dark, Soul Meets Body, Someday You Will Be Loved, and The Stable Song. <br />It is a much more produced sound and much easier for the masses to gobble up.  <br />This isnt the same DCFC that released Something About Airplanes about 6 years ago, but damn its still good.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This album is sure to satisfy all true Opeth fans. Buy this album now!!! You will not be disappointed.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Death Cab have done it again, if you liked any of the other Death Cab For Cutie albums you should like this one. Even after that fact of they're on a mainstream label now, they still put out a great album, it's a little more soft than other albums but it's still very enjoyable. Reminds me a bit of R.E.M (Warner Years).  Check it out.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|THE DVD IS AWESOME!! THERE IS FINALLY A COMMENTARY DONE MY RUSSELL CROWE HIS FIRST. THIS SHOULD OF BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO. THE GALLERIES ARE AWESOME THE BEHIND THE SCENES ARE GREAT.. THIS IS THE BEST THEY'VE DONE TO THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER...  RUSSELL IS AWESOME
B00005K9LM|5.0|This album is solid from beginning to end. You got great guitars on \\"Eat Me Alive\\", \\"Sentinel\\", and of course the magnificent \\"Freewheel Burning\\". If you are a Priest fan you must own this album, it as solid an album as they have ever done and I think it blows Screaming For Vengeance out of the water. The riffs and solos are great, Rob's voice is phenomenal, and the production on the remastered version sounds incredibly crisp and clear. 5 STARS
B00005JKGK|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  It was a had to have.  I highly recommend this movie, especially for women of all ages.  I can see myself in so many of the characters.  The woman I am, and the one I want to be.
0060594888|5.0|From the time I started reading this book, it was as if the book was glued to my fingers.  It stayed with me everywhere I went for a week. I have highlighted and underlined and read and reread.  I keep it out for reference, for support and just to reinforce that there is a fabulously wonderful way to be successful and have success. I have never seen or read so complete a book marking one for success. I can't imagine how long it must have taken to organize and create such a magical resource! Great sharing of personal stories, quotes, and how -to -do -it gloriously! Super education!  From one former educator to another, thank you, Jack!
0792843584|4.0|<br />1980 marks the 25th anniversary of one of the strangest media events ever.  There was an eagerly-awaited invitational preview on a Thursday for a four hour Michael Cimino western called HEAVEN'S GATE.  The whole industry came out in force to see Cimino's first movie since his Oscar-winning THE DEER HUNTER (1978) and, at a budget of $40 million, a movie that had bankrupt United Artists.  The result was apparently an unholy disaster-so awful that Friday opening day regular engagements were abruptly cancelled.  Reviews were venomous, focusing much more on the hefty budget and how an arrogant auteur filmmaker had brought down a studio with his excesses.  Roger Ebert was particularly hostile.  The 219 minute movie was sent back to the editing room with Cimino and several original editors.  In mid-1981, an all-new HEAVEN'S GATE was brought out at only 149 minutes.  The same hostile reviewers, except for Kevin Thomas in THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, still hated the movie for being too long and not having a coherent story.  I saw that shortned print, adored the movie, and sent a rave review to Mr. Cimino.  I got a very positive thank you letter from the filmmaker himself saying it was a hit in France.  In America, I think the 149 minute print played for only two weeks in deserted theaters.  Just for good luck, animal rights groups who had not seen the movie in any form were protesting the mistreatment of horses in the film. <br /> <br />Thank God for home video!  While heavily censored TV prints of HEAVEN'S GATE still run 149 minutes, the uncut 219 minute roadshow version (which importantly never got a theatrical run for the general public) is available on letterboxed videocassette and DVD.  Let us wish it a Happy 25th Birthday, forget all budget problems, and just evaluate what is up on the screen for 219 minutes. <br /> <br />According to writer/director Cimino, the Johnson County War took place in 1892 Casper, Wyoming.  It was a battle waged between Eastern European immigrants and American cattlemen.  The cattlemen, led by a despicable villain named Canton (Sam Waterston at his nastiest), claimed that the immigrants were stealing cattle and land in exchange for sexual favors in a local whorehouse run by Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert).  Acting under authority of the President and Federal Government, Canton and his Cattlemen's Association came up with a death list with 125 immigrant names on it, including Ella.  The movie's central protagonist is marshall Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson in the performance of his career), who is in love with Ella.  So is a bounty hunter named Nate Campion (Christopher Walken).  How can the critics say there is no story here?!  There is a passionate and romantic love triangle wrapped inside a powerful western conflict. As God is my witness, the uncut HEAVEN'S GATE is my favorite western of the last 25 years-yes, including Best Picture Oscar winners UNFORGIVEN (1992) and DANCES WITH WOLVES (1990), which are admittedly very good adult westerns also. <br /> <br />I have no idea what HEAVEN'S alleged $40 million budget would be in 2005 dollars.  Probably $80 million, which is hefty, but not unreasonable for a four hour period western meticulously shot on location on magnificent Idaho and Montana locations.  An entire frontier town (Casper?) was built in Kalispell, Montana.  A working antique train was brought to the location.  Nothing was too good for the genius who had won Oscars for THE DEER HUNTER only two years before.  The movie's art direction got a 1981 Oscar nomination.  The dusty sepia Panavision photography, by Vilmos Zsigmond, captures the look of antique photos.  There were horse wranglers for dozens of horses, dance and skating instructors (for an exquisite extended \\"Blue Danube Waltz\\" at Harvard at the beginning and a memorable roller skating scene in the film's middle).  David Mansfield's fiddle and mandolin score is unforgettably beautiful and haunting throughout, especially when \\"The BlueDanube Waltz\\" becomes a slow motion dirge during the latter battle scenes.  The climactic battle is violent and seems to go on as long as the real 1892 cattlemen/immigrants battle.  It is a horrible and beautiful sustained sequence--maybe lasting an hour of screen time--that is severely shortened in the cut TV print.  This is one gorgeous piece of filmmaking by a master who admittedly let the movie get away from him.  It IS too long and IS too pessimistic.  But at least you can see where the money went. It is a true labor of love movie that, ironically, may be Cimino's finest films.  I don't think it is quite as great as THE DEER HUNTER, but certainly it is better than Cimino's modestly budgeted subsequent films. <br /> <br />(PLOT SPOILERS-BEWARE!)  It is impossible to discuss why I love the uncut HEAVEN'S GATE so much without discussing the 20 minute Prologue and five minute Epilogue.  So many critics call these scenes extraneous and confused, but they are the very heart of the movie for me. The Prologue takes place at 1870 Harvard with Jim Averill as a young student in love with a young woman he is frustratingly too shy to talk to; they exchange smiles.  Averill is haunted by this beautiful young woman all his life, as I am by a married young woman I loved at UCLA long ago and cannot get out of my mind.  Joseph Cotten has a cameo as a head professor, and John Hurt is the class orator.  Look at the end credits.  Writer Cimino really did his homework-these are real speeches being spoken.  And the dance on Harvard lawn, a lengthy and enthralling \\"Blue Danube Waltz\\", may be one of the American cinema's loveliest set pieces.  Shockingly, it is sometimes cut for time on TV showings, instead of the overlong battle much later. <br /> <br />The Epilogue is the key to the whole movie for me.  Study it.  (PLOT SPOILER ALERT!)  It is 1903, and Jim Averill is the sole survivor of the bloody Johnson County War.  I won't tell you how or where Nate and Ella die.  We are on a yacht off Newport, Rhode Island at sunset.  Averill is below deck with a young woman.  He has finally married at least a surrogate for the girl of his dreams from Harvard long ago and is still deeply unhappy. He lights a cigarette for his presumed wife, while staring off into space, lost in his dreams of the past.  He walks back up on deck for one of the most beautiful final shots in the American cinema of the 1980's. (Beware of an old VHS tape version that omits this final scene and freezes on Jim below deck!)  And Mansfield's music, as always, is incomparable. <br /> <br />So, the majestic and magnificent HEAVEN'S GATE, in its uncut 219 minute form at least, is a portrait of the entire lifetime of  Jim Averill, from Harvard youth in 1870, to Wyoming marshall in 1892, to a lonely middle aged intellectual man in 1903 with all of his friends dead or long gone.  It is so haunting, and Mansfield's exquisite music plus Zsigmond's sepia-tinted Panavision photography, again make it a truly special motion picture if you have a whole evening viewing slot.  (There is an intermission on the letterboxed VHS copy I am reviewing.)  Happy 25th Birthday, HEAVEN'S GATE! <br /> <br />(UP FRONT CAUTION:  THIS MOVIE CONTAINS STRONG AND SUSTAINED VIOLENCE, HORSES AND TRIP WIRES,  PROFANITY, AND SEX SCENES WITH FRONTAL NUDITY.  REVIEWED FROM LETTERBOXED VIDEOCASSETTE.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0312979479|3.0|This is a fabulous mystery novel, a classic. I would recommend it to one and all. HOWEVER, this particular edition is missing a vital component, namely the list and description of the major characters which has been included at the beginnning of every Agatha Christy novel that I have read, including other editions of this one. The ommission of this list makes it extremely difficult for anyone not familiar with the book to follow the plot. The reasoning behind  St. Martin's Press's decision to ommitt this list of characters is indeed a mystery worth solving. My advice is to find another edition of the book elsewhere. Amazon needs to sell an editon which includes this important element.
0385334206|5.0|Firstly, no one here is trying to insult one another's intelligence. We're all friends. But I have to say, I believe people who have been posting that Vonnegut is \\"racist\\" in this book have seriously not delved the slightest bit into what this man is trying to get across. It seems these people believe that any use of the word \\"nigger\\" in a novel promots racism. This man is telling a story the way he choses to tell it, you cannot decide his writing reflects his own personal beliefs. But all that aside, Vonnegut is using his quick, out of the blue phrases to breakdown what seems so complex in society today, hes anti-philosophical, not trying to elaborate into the wild blue yonder, but simplfy things into human, man to man terms. His writings in this book are often an attempt to put racisim in a light that seems ignorant, and nonsensical, which is exactly what racism is! Please try and seem, this is one of the greatest authors of our time, and I really enjoyed this book. Hope you do too

B0000035E7|3.0|\\"Bleach\\" is nowhere near Nirvana's later efforts \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In utero\\". On this album, one would have never thought Kurt Cobain would inherit the musical status he has today. An intersting album to see where the band started and where it finished but by no means a musical breakthrough.  <br />On the other hand, for those who despise the commerciality of \\"Nevermind\\" this album is genuine and sounds like a live entertaining band.
B000002U9P|4.0|Tina Turner is a legend through and through. She is the ULTIMATE idol. With her strong will against all odds, passion for music, and flair for captivating audiences around the world, Tina Turner is the epitome of the grande dame diva. Tina Turner has always been my idol and I admire her for her struggles and triumphs and I think she is one of the most influencial performers we have out there! Well, enough about me gushing!  <br />\\"Break Every Rule\\" is a rocking and socking romp and it pleases any Tina fan whether they like the gritty hard-rockin'n'rolling tunes (The Bryan Adams penned \\"Back Where You Started\\"-which sounds soo Bryan Adams!) to soft and lush ballads (the gorgeous and flowing \\"Paradise Is Here\\") to pure pop fodder (the funky and slamming \\"Typical Male\\"). \\"Break Every Rule\\" does break every music rule. Tina mushes pop, rock, jazz, blues and even country to fuse together a diverse album, and one that was not a familliar album line-up back in the '80s.  <br />\\"What You Get Is What You See\\" has a swinging, country and rock vibe while \\"Break Every Rule\\" sounds every little bit country as does \\"Till The Right Man Comes Along\\" and I almost picture Tina in a small dank saloon singing in cowboy boots!  <br />My two favorites off this album have to be dark city street-esque \\"Afterglow\\" (great keyboard solo by Steve Windwood), the lush and loving \\"Two People\\". The David Bowie penned \\"Girls\\" is pleasing (though I'm not a fan of Bowie) and I'd like how Tina sang the song with such finesse.  <br />I also LOVE \\"Typical Male\\", with Phil Collins playing the drums and Tina belting out sassy lyrics, I love the distant keyboards and the little sassy message this song has. Then icing on the cake for me is \\"Paradise Is Here\\" which is just so beautiful and so meldoic. I love the sax part. <br />\\"Break Every Rule\\" is one of Tina's finest hours and she certainly knows how to put a diverse and stunning piece of musicship together!  <br /> <br />StarSprinkles TOP 5 <br />1.

B00000K3D4|5.0|I had enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out and really enjoy it now that I am older.  Love the special effects, the music, and of course, David Bowie!!
B000002KMY|4.0|This CD followed the same basic formula as its predecessor, Heaven and Hell. Great riffs and solos from Iommi and Dio's fantasy lyrics. Mob is good but not as good as Heaven and Hell. The songwriting is on the same track but not quite as strong. I would agree with others that these songs are a little heavier and darker throughout and Iommi shows again that he was and is the best metal guitarist. His solos here are screaming. I miss Bill Ward's drumming also on this one. Vinnie Appice is solid, but Ward's style helped create the Sabbath sound and you can tell it's not the same on Mob Rules.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This CD is awesome. I actually hadn't gotten any of SOAD's cd's previous to this one, but after listening, I went out and bought Toxicity and Steal This Album, and loved those just as much. This is a break from the repetitive music you hear, it is something new and unique. Here's my ratings:    Soldier Side-Nice slow intro to the rest of the CD, but not really a song, so it's hard to rate but w/e 10/10    BYOB-It grows on you. It's about the war in Iraq, and the results of having Bush as our leader(not good results).The first few listens it's chaos, but you start to appreciate this song, and I love it now, especially the truth in the lyrics. I love the poppy chorus, mixed in with the rest of the song. 9/10    Revenga-Basically about dysfunctional relationships, and revenge. Awesome verses, quick, and goes good with the music. The drumming on this CD is unbeliveably good. Kind've boring chorus. 8/10    Cigaro-Didn't like it at first, but it is one of my favorites now. Quirky lyrics, followed by heavy chorus. About the \\"important\\" business people thinking there better than everyone else. 10/10    Radio/Video-Strangest song I've ever heard, and also one of the catchiest. It's about the shallowness of most celebrites. \\"Hey man,look at me rockin out, I'm on the video\\" Great song. 9/10    This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song-Strange title, strange song. But strange doesn't mean bad. This song, with it's random lyrics, is very catchy. \\"I hope your stepson doesn't eat the fish\\" I would tell you what it was about if I knew. Too short. 8/10    Violent Pornography- 2nd Favorite on the CD. It's about all the crap on your TV, and how useless and brainwashing it is. Poppy verses, with a great, heavy bridge, leading to a catchy, normal sounding rock chorus. Really listen to these guys lyrics in their songs, because they actually mean something. 10/10    Question!-MY FAVORITE. THis song is unbelievable, it gives me goosebumps listening to how powerful it is. The creepy,almost whispered verses, leading dramatically up to the scarily good chorus. This song NEVER gets old. The meaning of it is up to you. 11/10    Sad Statue-Cool sounding song, very political, basically about how our generation is so seperated, and don't agree with each other's views. Quick, quirky sounding verses, with a slowed down, heavy but not that heavy chorus. All fits together really good. 9/10    Old School Hollywood-Funny song, but gets old. Only \\"bad\\" track on this CD, and it's only bad compared to the rest of this CD. Its about one of the band members experience at a celeb baseball game with washed up celebs. Techno voice in it is cool. 6/10    Lost In Hollywood-I was waiting for the heavy part, because the other songs always seem slow, or seem fast, then go to the opposite, which is awesome. But it never came, and this is a great way to close out this CD. an unexpected slow song, and it is about the bad side of hollywood. Perfect ending. 9/10    This CD is completely worth your money. Worst thing is the length, which is very short, but the other half, Hypnotize, is coming out soon. THis wasn't exactly the type of music I was into, but this band is so different, that it's basically all I listen to now. Try it out, even if you are a big rap fan, or any music fan. You will like it, trust me. There isn't many times when buying one CD of an artist leads me to go spend money on another two of their cd's within a week.
B0009TRRN0|4.0|Thye information shown in the synopsis is incorrect-the star is Tomisaburo Wakayama, not Shintaro Katsu[a star in his own right in the Zatoichi series, and real life brother to Wakayama.] <br />Regardless,I regard this film as the definitive one in the \\"Baby Cart\\" series.
B00005AQGH|5.0|This album is also alot of people's favorite. This album is dark and eerie starting with the cover, if u don't know what i'm talking about just look at it. Then from the beginning there is a part where someone says \\"___ shot em\\" but according to the people they say it was sure shot instead. Then there's Bomb First 5/5 which is part 2 of Ambitionz az a riddah where Pac and the Outlawz just ridin on Bad Boy and Mobb Deep, after that Hail Mary 5/5 one of his most creepy and greatest songs. From there Toss It Up 4/5 party cut where he takes shots at Dre for leaving da Row, To Live In Die In LA 5/5(Califonia Love part 2), one of my favorite's. Blasphemy 5/5 is deep like So Many Tears Pac spits\\"Mama am I wrong is God just another cop, waiting to beat my a** if I dont go pop. Life Of An Outlaw 4/5 is just another song to introduce the Outlawz, Just Like Daddy 5/5 goes out to the females. Krazy 5/5 goes out to the weed smokers, White Manz World 5/5 is political. Me and my Girlfriend 5/5 is a song about him and his gun, Hold Ya Head 5/5 goes out to the homiez lock'd up. The there's Against All Odds 5/5 another battle song. This album is shorter than All Eyes On Me but its more potent. Listening to this its clear Pac knew his time was up, and to me this was the it for hip hop. After this album everything has been on a slow decline. RIP Pac
0446677450|4.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining a new perspective on wealth and money.  Kiyosaki has managed to repackage classic ideas about money (i.e. those presented in \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\") in a way that will inspire modern day wealth-seekers.   <br /> <br />I would not, however, recommend this book to anyone looking for tactical information on how to build wealth.  While this book is more than just \\"Babylon\\" with a new purple cover, don't bother to crack the spine if you want specifics or strategy on how Rich Dad made his millions. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00097A5I6|4.0|Let's think about what's been happening to rock music (and all music scene) in the last 5 years. Coldplay came in 2000 as a breakthrough and is king right now (but it seems that they're not as astonished with success as Gallagher Bros were back in late 90's), Radiohead is still the best \\"alternative\\" rock band, Travis, Muse, Placebo are great bands, but that's all... garage rock came sweepingly in 2001 with the strokes, the hives, the vines, the datsuns, etc... and in the same way it's on its way to leave... the matter with rock music right now is that it has lost its own identity... its looking for itself in the past, because (as the sex pistols said) there's no future... but there's hope if you listen to Coldplay, RH... (and Oasis) <br />In this context, you can consider Oasis's last album as a great happening to rock music... but why? <br />First, you listen at them and they have reinvented themselves... they have acquired maturity as persons and as musicians. They're not the kings of music as they were back in 1996 and they understand that... so Ego-mania and self flattery are beside the lyrics of this album. You listen at this album and you're listening at Oasis as an entire entity (just put attention to Zack Starkey (Ringo Star's son) on the drums...) not just The Gallagher Bros and Co.  <br />This time you won't find hymnes like Stand By Me, Around the World, Champagne supernova, Don't Go away, Don't Look Back in Anger, Wonderwall, Stop Crying Tour Heart Out (maybe just Lyla will sound like a hymne)... but you'll listen a more experimental sound (but very accessible sound), not just trying to emulate the Beatles (it seems that they have understood that they're NOT the Beatles)... and in fact this time they turn their heads to the Stones sounds (just listen at Lyla last chords and piano outro: Street Fighting Man 38 years later), the Faces, and even the Who and Led Zeppelin, in  one word.. they're Mod Rock revisited (revisited, not repeated, it's Mod Rock as it should sound in 2000's)... But they still sound as Oasis. <br />Oasis is  intelligent enough to get back to rock roots and take the basic elements of this kind of music, but avoiding to fall in nostalgia.  <br />On the other hand, Lyrics have never been Oasis's strong side, but this time it seems like they also put attention on them, so you'll find a more lirical-oriented sound. <br />Oasis's return is a great happening not only because of the music, but for the idea that they bring to us. <br />They have understood that they're musicians, and they have to make music. So that's what this record is about. Music. Great music from a band that seemed to be dead. Oasis is music. Rock music. And we should be happy to know that Rock is not dead.
B000002A46|5.0|Though it has been more than a decade but I honestly find that this is one of the best Christmas album that has been produced by a pop artiste. Honestly speaking Mariah did a tremendously wonderful job. <br /> <br />There are a quite a number of classical xmas tracks and Mariah herself has penned a few songs as well. In my opinion \\"All I Want For Christmas\\" has become so big a hit. There are singers who are doin covers on it. This is one of the track that you definitely have to listen to on christmas day. <br /> <br />Mariah was flawless and perfect when she sang O Holy Night. Its one of the best version I ever heard of so far. She sang with so much emotions and not forgetting to mention her famous \\"dog whistling\\" at the end of the song.  <br /> <br />Hark The Herald Angels Sing. She moved me when she sing this song. She gave me goosebumps. Her voice is angelic..  <br /> <br />Other notable tracks are Miss You Most (at Christmas Time), <br />Joy To The World, Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child, Jesus Born On This Day.  <br />
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Logistics first: the dvd's are amazing; the movie hysterical, the extras compelling. My particular favorites were the feature on Kubrick's life in pictures and the salute to the man of many methods him self -- Peter Sellers. Both are very informative and fun to watch. Even the split screen interview of George C Scott and Peter Sellers was worth the watch.  <br /> <br />As for the movie in its entirety, it is indeed a masterpiece. It is  one of the most well acted comedies of all time. Peter Sellers in three roles of which I had no clue until the end credits, George C Scott as the imature commander who over acted into the zone of perfection, and Slim Pickens as the captain of the fated B-52 bomber that delivers the \\"release\\" of war-like and subtle sexual tensions all across the board while riding his phallic like atomic bomb into oblivion. What else can be said, he who makes fun of the end of the world...should be respected and laughed at in all of its worth. Investigate the movie, it only gets better and better...
B00004RJ74|4.0|This is another highlight for Quentin Tarrantino. He is amazing writer and you he really shows it here. <br /> <br />The script is very unique combining, what seems like 2 different movies, compiled into one. It starts out with these two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarrantino) as runaway robbers who take Harvey Keitel's family hostage on their trailer and go to a bar in Mexico. Now, that's the first half of the movie. In that you get a great sense of tension. With Clooney's incredible acting as a raw thug, he makes you feel uneasy and nervous as he waves his gun around in a cool manner threatening the lives of these innocent people. <br /> <br />But then the film takes a total 360 degree u-turn and when they get to the bar, it turns out the employees are vampires and it becomes a slasher flick. Now, the thought of that may turn Tarrantino fans off, but the two movies are combined so well that you still find yourself into the movie just as much as before the plot turn then during it. <br /> <br />I think Tarrantino fans will be quite surprised by how good this film actually is. He really steps out of his normal crime territory and delivers something new and unique. <br /> <br />Nods to Harvey Keitel's acting as he plays the whole thing calm and cool even though him and his family's lives are threatened. But George Clooney really shines the most as he plays a character in which you've never seen him before. <br /> <br />Fans of tense crime thrillers and slasher/horror flicks should be very impressed with the stunning combination of both genres creating an original thriller unlike none other.
0670033375|5.0|This book is one of the most scholarly and carefully researched books ever published.  It condenses data that would take many people many lifetimes to discover and understand.  I urge everyone to read this book.  It is a bit dry at times.  It would be more fun to read a novel. If a catastrophe will take decades to play out, for many it is more pleasant to be ignorant than to be responsible, aware, and working on a solution. <br /> <br /> The point of this book is that when societies allow population to grow to the edge of food production capacity in good times, there will be a disaster in bad times.  It seems simple, but most societies have no ability to control over procreation.  It is said to be a personal matter.  Such societies just let nature do it for them the hard way. <br /> <br /> The new world has provided some escape from this vicious cycle for a few hundred years by providing a place for the excess populations of the world to find refuge and continue expanding. <br /> <br /> When the new world is full, the stage will be set for the biggest disaster of them all, because the whole world is now dependent on far flung food production linked by a fragile and energy intensive distribution system with only a few weeks of reserve at the extremities. <br /> <br /> This book is a warning that most people will ignore and and as a consequence many of our grandchildren or great grandchildren are likely to starve as a consequence.  It will be those unfortunate enough to live at the extremities of the distribution system. I hope that enough responsible people read this book to make a difference in our many converging societies.
0312330529|1.0|What a let down! After reading all the positive reviews and hearing all the talk about what a great masterpiece this book is it took me precisely seventeen pages of tortured reading to set this book aside.    While the place setting is mildly intriguing the terrible prose quickly diminished any interest that was briefly picqued. Rather than having been written by an escaped convict holed up in a seedy hotel room smoking dope, it struck me as having been written by a below average college freshman holed up in a dormroom smoking dope.Whoever wrote the blurb on the cover deserves more credit.     All I can say is that it strikes me as a sad indicator of what proves to be popular reading and which elicits such widespread adulation, if that is to be believed. I will say though that this \\"tome\\" is sufficiently hefty to act as fine doorstop.

B00006879E|4.0|I do not usually do reviews, especially for bands who are \\"the flavour of the day.\\"  I must say though that I found this CD to be a great collection of songs almost telling a story.  Of course everyone knows the popular ones like Sunday Morning and This Love, I happen to like the more obscure ones that do not get a lot of radio play such as Harder to Breathe and Rag Doll.  Over all, a well put together album that is easy on the ears.  He has a good voice and the band does not overpower the music.  And like I said, Jane has definitely made an impact on these guys.  A definite keeper
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I became a fan of the Dark Knight following Frank Miller's genius \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" in the mid-80s. I loved the reinvention of the character, making him darker, brooding, and bordering on psychotic. It was this reinvention that most likely allowed the making of the original Batman movie, as well as its 3 successors. However, I found myself dissecting each of those movies as I exited the theater, feeling dissatisfied with each.<br /><br />After four previous attempts, two of them bordering on catastrophic, Hollywood has finally gotten it right. This is not your big brother's Batman.<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan has stripped away all the flash from the previous two movies, making Gotham City appear to be more like an enormous amusement park, and made it the gritty, murky urban sprawl that Batman fans have come to embrace as the home of Bruce Wayne. We also get much more of a feel as to why Wayne is so tortured and driven to do what he does for the city. The character of Bruce Wayne is the focus of this movie, whereas the villains have been the focus of the previous movies. We learn why Wayne is so tortured, and how deep his psyche is scarred. Story holes are plugged that were left gaping in previous efforts. In time, I believe that Christian Bale will replace Michael Keaton as the general consensus favorite in the role of the Guardian of Gotham, as he truly puts the Dark in Dark Knight.<br /><br />Perhaps the best part of this edition of the Batman series is the long overdue establishment of the relationship between Batman and Jim Gordon, a police sergeant in this early stage of the legend. In previous movies, the character of Gordon was all but made irrelevant, and in some cases, a buffoon. Gordon is not only a tough cop, but is the only member of the police force that Batman will allow to get close to him. That element is presented flawlessly here.<br /><br />The acting is better than your average comic book flick. Christian Bale captures perfectly the brood of Batman, as well as the careless, playboy persona of Bruce Wayne. Katie Holmes does a good job in shedding her \\"Dawson's Creek\\" image, and handles the character of Rachael Dawes well. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the support cast turn in worthy performances in their respective roles. The plot is thicker than previous efforts, and the villains' role in said plot is far from insulting to the intelligence of even a casual Bat-fan.<br /><br />While this movie has plenty of bangs for the buck, it does not feel like a gratuitous effort. Each special effect has a meaning, and if this movie's intent was to wipe the slate clean, and offer an apology for the previous four Batman movies, then mission accomplished. This is a comic book movie that does not present itself as a comic book movie. Each character and story element is believable, and I sincerely hope that the key elements from this project will be back for a sequel in a few years. If you're a fan of the comic, you will thoroughly enjoy this effort. If you aren't a fan of the comic, you just might be after viewing Batman Begins.s the careless, playboy persona of Bruce Wayne.

B00065U08Q|5.0|Fru fans, do not overlook this album.  This one takes more time to get used to it - but, all Fru albums have that characteristic to some degree.  Revisit this one again and again, and it makes more sense.   <br /> <br />This album can't be categorized.  Buy it if you enjoy unusual music with sophisticated melodies.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Great Jane Austen adaptation and surprisingly true to the text.  Possibly Gwyneth Paltrow's best work ever! <br /> <br />
B0009XT8YW|5.0|After this unforgettably stunning performance and the upcoming \\"GUILTY PLEASURES\\" followup, many music fans are probably wondering what incredibly remarkable music Barry Gibb could produce for the other premiere female vocalist, LINDA RONSTADT. Ah, if wishes could only come true!
B00025ETIW|5.0|This is an unbelieveable album, in the best sense of the word. It could be said that it is of a particular taste but to anyone who has ever felt just a little too human, flawed, lost, it just gives you strength. The music is great, the lyrics are abstract, leaving it open to your own search for meaning. This album gives you whatever you chose to take from it and you'd have to have a closed mind to not appreciate its aims. Deep, hard, dark but positive. There should be more like it.
B000002JS6|5.0|this is the first album the band made after the death of bon scott, it was supposed to be a recovery album, but i think it just might be their greatest. its solid all the way through, from hells bells, to rock and roll aint noise pollution. some of my favorites are what do you do for money honey and let me put my love into you. its pretty simple stuff, until you get to the solos which are pretty awesome. if your a fan of rock, this is a must buy.
B0000029GA|5.0|I can't nothing but admit it. This is a great album. And i know why: <br />DJ Premier is a genius! When he has something to do with it, it has to be great.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|It's an effects-fest, it's an action flick, and it's a Keanu Reeves film. Despite that last point, it's an exciting bit of entertainment.<br /><br />Chain-smoking John Constantine sees demons everywhere, real demons. That sets him up with a great job as hired-gun exorcist, which gets him into and out of lots of interesting scrapes. He sees the angel Gabriel, and sees Hell as well. It's an up to date story in the heaven/hell/demons tradition. For me, it works well as an action story even though the pseudo-Catholic mythology doesn't.<br /><br />Reeves is Reeves, with his usual angst-laden running around and monotone voice. The pleasant surprise was Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. The role is vaguely androgynous, a good match for the gender-bending in Swinton's earlier \\"Orlando.\\" She did a good job with her few appearances, and generally rose above the ordinary script she was given.<br /><br />If you like the demons-on-earth genre, you might find good entertainment here. Unless it's truly exceptional, though, an exorcism movie's premise just never grabs me. I came away from Constantine un-grabbed.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: This is an adaptation from the Hellblazer comic book series, which I haven't read. Based on what I saw in this movie, I probably won't bother.
B000002ACR|5.0|YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY is a classic mid-period Byrds release. The songs are all great, especially \\"So You Want To Be A Rock & Roll Star\\" and a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"My Back Pages.\\" The former pokes fun at the rock-star-making process, while the latter expresses why I place my dream of looking good for a young woman I met in September of 2007 as a higher priority than food-related functions at my old school; in other words, the song makes a point that living in the past is not necessarily such a good thing. The fact that the surviving members of the Byrds believe that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000002JQ6|5.0|im not the biggest acdc fan out there but a friend offered me a few of their cds so i said why not. this cd is amazing, easily the best. its basically a greatest hits album. the sound quality is great so other then a little fan interaction and some amp squeels its pretty hard to tell.  <br />overall, if you like rock you need to get this. acdc is one of the greatest classic rock bands of all time. this is a good place to start if you are new to the band.
B00006F7IM|5.0|the funniest heart warming movie i have seen in a long time. with so many serious things in the world now, just watch this movie and bust a gut laughing. good actors, superb story line.
B00005JNTX|5.0|(some small spoilers) <br /> <br />This is the closest I think anyone has ever come to adapting a comic to film, it's not just adapted to a film like so many other comic to film renditions, the comic *is* the film. At points it reminds of Casablanca while meeting a massive bloodbath. Bits of color flash or blend making you notice key emoting, physical acting, action, personallity and scenery effect that reflect what's shown in comic pannels. There are also amazing comic style angles brought to life in the cinematography. Any key moment in the again hyper-styleized  action, violence, scenery and purposfull pulp novel/ comic over acting is highlighted, close uped or strangely angled to reflect and emphisize exactly what the comics do while at the same time being alive. truely the most original cinematography in a very very long time. But if your looking for a fairly realistic stylized film working with common logic you've come to the wrong place. It's an exersize in harsh gratuity in a dark and almost alternate world and it couldn't be more satisfying. Everything is overblown and defies physics and all reality, human characters dive through windows of moving vehicles, smash faces through brick walls, talk to the decapitated, have specialty killing skills take out massive amouts of people avoiding utter oblivion through common comic (and film) deus ex machina such as the jammed gun at the last second, hookers look like fettish models straight out of expensive european modeling agencys and run city sections territorally, and don't forget the ninja, and theese are just to name a few. The story (like everything else) is utterly gratuitous in disturbing, fleshy, smoky, grimy, gritty sequences of terrible events with only the good the sick and the sickest (characters). A brilliant peice of film that will hopefully be rememebered for it's trail blazed in black, white, blood, booms, badabooms and bullets for decades to come. So yeah, I loved it. Go America!

B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act Is Pearl Jams most strongest album released yet. <br />The whole album plays very strongly and their are no interlude type tracks such as on \\"Yield\\" or \\"No Code\\" and production is far better sounding than the last (Binuaral) album. <br /> <br />(The only criticism would have to be the 2003 tour which if , you watch Live at the Garden DVD, it looks like the band have been having a bit of lazy time and getting slack) <br /> <br />But that aside this is by far the most solid and impressive album yet.
B00005AWMF|5.0|growing up I listened to a few Sade song's sometimes on the radio, or watching them on tv. Now all grown up I couldn't remember the titles so I was clueless on which album or single to buy.  <br /> <br />So let me just state this: You will not regret buying this album. The songs are so beautiful, and it's like a walk down Memory Lane because you slowly remember most of the songs and the lyrics have a whole new sense. This is an awesome album to unwind to, I can't imagine not owning this CD, and I'm sure it'll make a great gift.
6305949980|2.0|Not the best.  Yeah, it's edgy and stuff, whatever.  I really don't care if it's edgy or not.  It's kind of insipid.  The animation and direction are fantastic, and Danny Elfman has ALWAYS done a wonderful job when it comes to scores/soundtracks, but the movie itself is pretty bad.  The plot is silly.  The whole \\"be yourself\\" message is older than dirt.  The little \\"creepy twist\\" put on said message is, again, silly.  I honestly do not know why it has such a following.  If anyone would like to tell me, I don't think my email's hidden.  If it is, send any messages (literate ones, mind) about why this movie is so great to Nessarose.of.the.East@gmail.com
B0001BS4Q0|5.0|This album, song after song is beautiful and brilliant. This is one of the few albums that I can listen to the whole way through. I'm still getting used to the slight genre change on Sweet Potato, but it's a good song. If you loved Breathe Me, just buy the album.
B0006399FS|1.0|What happened to this album, its was the bees knees in 2004 and what is it now? <br /> <br />In fact people were already slagging this album off when it came out, cause its boring, uninspiring and show that U2 are not artists anymore, just careerists. <br /> <br />Thats the problem with music and its state at the moment, the reason why its so bad is because everyone involved in music is just a bunch of careerists and the music industry is nothing more than a corrupt force trying to stack up the cash. <br /> <br />Anyone can get a record deal these days, look at Britney Spears, Nickelback or the Pussycat dolls, or Freaking Schnu Sncha Shannpy! <br /> <br />As for U2, if they are still a band that \\"means it\\" it certainly does'nt look like they're in it for the music anymore. <br /> <br />The album for a start is the most thrown together piece of crap, the cover is awful and boring the music singles sound like its for chart topping.  <br /> <br />\\"All because of you\\" does'nt seem to get much airplay after a month or so any of the others singles for that matter. <br /> <br />As for the ticket prices mentioned by the reviewer below me, its quite disgracefull charging whatever amount it was  <br />(100 something) to see them live,  <br />what the heak do they need the money for? they're among the richest rock stars on the planet and they ask the fans for that, not to mention the website fiasco. <br /> <br />Noel Gallaghar of Oasis mentioned the same thing about ticket prices, about how U2 and Rolling Stones were charging ridiculous amounts of money for their gigs while Oasis were trying to keep the costs to a limit so everyone could attend. <br />  <br />Another example is Pearl Jam, when they threatened to sue ticket master for charging large amounts of money to fans, when they requested to keep the costs down, so they went on two? or one lower key tours and made up their own ticket prices. <br /> <br />If people are gonna say, it costs money for the world tour (stage, lighting, travel etc.) well what about the Popmart tour that no one liked because people are boring and narrow minded, the U2 management nearly went bankrupt because of the production, nevermind though, it was about the fans and music. <br /> <br />Different story now. <br /> <br />Forget this album and band, the last glimpse of anything good was on \\"All that you can't leave behind\\" and even that seemed to be lacking any passion. <br /> <br />Get new albums by rock artists who mean it. <br />Ocean Colour Scene \\"Hyperactive Workout...\\" 2005 <br />Manic Street Preachers \\"Lifeblood\\" 2004 <br />Supergrass \\"The road to rohen\\" 2005 <br /> <br /> <br />
B000068VHQ|5.0|I was very happy to finally get my favourite album of the Cranberries, and even more thrilled to find the 5 extra tracks. They are all very great songs, as I knew they would be. The Cranberries are one of the few musical performers that I have found not to dislike a single song I've heard of theirs. If you are a true lover of music, I'm sure you'll love the Cranberries.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|Both stars go to performers.  Michelle Federer, Norbert Leo Butz, Carole Shelley, Kristen Chenoweth, Joel Grey and Idina Menzel are all fantastic performers, but they're in a vehicle of utter crap.   <br /> <br />And I have a few thoughts on Idina.  She's a great actress (see RENT or LaChuisa's The Wild Party), and she's a good singer on her own (see her solo CDs, which are divine).  But on this CD and in this show, she's horriffic.  She belts almost every song.  Contrary to the beliefs of many fans of Wicked, that is a very, very bad thing.  It's bad for the vocal cords.  It causes them to vibrate much faster than they should and become inflamed.  Too much will cause polyps to develop and permanently damage the vocal cords.   <br />Idina's going to be out of sight soon, what with her belting on top of the fact that she smokes.  That would be much less irritating if so many young girls didn't hero-worship the (extremely flawed, but that's another rant) character of Elphaba and attempt to sing along to all of her songs.  Or, rather, belt along.  Causing a wonderful generation of little \\"singers\\" who use no technique at all and just shout and scream all the time when they're supposed to be singing. <br />One can still get the volume and power needed for songs such as Defying Gravity without belting.  There is a technique (used, interestingly enough, by Kristen Chenoweth a lot) called the mixed belt.  It's a mix of the chest voice (usually for lower notes, louder sound, and belting) and the head voice (higher voice, more melodic and lyrical, but not quite as loud unless REALLY trained).  The two together produce, at first, at tinny, whiney sound, but with practice, that whininess can be eliminated and a wonderful sound can be produced.   <br /> <br />Moving on to another rant, the script, lyrics, and characters must be addressed. <br /> <br />I am not happy with Gregory Maguire for caving to every bad character and plot change made by Wicked's production team.  Compare, for example the character of Nessarose onstage to Nessarose in the original book.  In the book, Nessa is an angry, bitter, powerful witch.  On stage...she's useless.  She's still bitter, but it's because she's jealous of Elphaba's \\"talent\\".  Said talent was nonexistant in the book.  Hell, Elphaba didn't even major in sorcery!  She was a bio major.   <br />And now, Fiyero.  Fiyero was a sweetheart with a child-bride whom he'd never met before in the book.  He loved Elphaba.  He never went near anyone else.  He was far too nice.  His wife, Sarima, never even made it to the stage. <br />Glinda's next.  She was a shallow, self-centered, clueless witch in the book.  On stage, she has some deeper inner core that was originally nonexistant.  The fact that she was such a selfish horror in the book made her such a great character, and made it all the better that she moved to the impoverished undereducated Quadlands (south) of Oz to work with the people there.  That was the REAL meaning of \\"continuing Elphaba's work\\".   <br /> <br />By the way, Elphie was supposed to die because Dorothy was a klutz (she was just trying to help Elphaba in her quest against the Wizard.  Elphaba's sleeve had caught on fire.  Dorothy put it out by pouring a bucket of water on her.  Elphaba MELTED), Fiyero was NOT the Scarecrow, Boq was NOT the Tin Woodsman, nor did he have anything at all to do with Nessa EVER, Nessa never tried to steal the Grimmerie, Chistery (the leader of the flying monkeys) was a normal monkey rescued by Elphaba during a storm whom she'd sewn wings onto with the help of the Grimmerie and her biology training (all the flying monkeys were made that way), Elphaba's father was not an important man at all but a simple preacher (her mother's father was a huge political figure in Munchkinland and Elphaba stood to inherit the title before disappearing into the Vinkus for years, thus forfeiting said title to Nessa), and Nessa was called the Wicked Witch of the East because of her anti-Wizard feelings (she even had her munchkins tearing up the Yellow Brick Road that the Wizard had set up to connect all of Oz, thus increasing his ability to send troops wherever he wanted and having a firmer stranglehold on the country).

IN MINNEAPOLIS MN. DAMN GREAT SHOW. TEASTAMENT OPENING WITH SOULS AND THE PIT BEGAN. MY ASS JUMPED OVER SECURITY AND WAS STOMPING WITH THE BEST. I ALWAYS TELL MY SELF THAT IT WASN'T A GOOD PIT UNLESS I AM HURT AND BLEEDING SEVERLY. I WAS ENJOYING THE MOSHING WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE PIT \\"EVEN MET SOME COOL METALHEADS THAT I TALK TO STILL TODAY\\" WHEN A SECURITY GUARD DROPPED ME LIKE I WAS USED JAMASS. HE SAID I KICKED HIM IN THE FACE WHEN I JUMPED OVER HIM \\"CRY BABY\\" MY FRIENDS THAT ARE NOT THE MOSHING TYPE WERE IN THE STADIUM SEATING AND WERE WATCHING ME AND THE SITUATION OCCURE. TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, MY 3RD AND 4TH RIB WAS BROKE ON MY RIGHT SIDE AND I NEEDED SOME HELP OUT OF THE PIT. MY FRIENDS DID JUST THAT AND WE PUT IN A COMPLAINT THE SECOND I WAS OUT OF MY FUN ZONE, FOR MY PAIN AND SUFFERING OF A MAD ASS WE GOT TO MEET THE HEADLINERS \\" JUDAS\\" THAT WAS METAL AT ITS FINEST. AWESOME BAND AND DAMN STRAIGHT-UP HEADBANGERS. THIS IS AN ALBUM YOU SHOULDNOT BE WITHOUT! P.S. A GREAT SHOW IN DEED EVEN WITH THE PAIN!!!!!!!!!!!
B00009Y3L4|3.0|Oh my. <br /> <br />Not bad.  On its own, a pretty good movie.  York's Cliff is an interesting thing, an all speaking role as opposed to the intermittant singing done on stage.  Joel Grey's emcee remains basically unchanged.  Sally...oh dear.  Liza kind of missed the point of the title song.  Sally isn't that strong.  She's supposed to be having a total mental breakdown.  Her entire world has been torn apart and she's supposed to be at the Klub singing that \\"life is a cabaret\\".   <br /> <br />Meh.  Minelli can sing her ass off, there's no disputing that,  and her diva-esque Sally is an interesting interpretation.  Not my favorite portrayal, but okay.  This is, by the way, the ONLY place to hear the song \\"Money Money\\".  The revival included it, but it was by the Emcee and Kit Kat girls in replacement of the original Sitting Pretty...and Alan Cumming was fairly bad.  <br /> <br />Watch it.  Form your own opinion.  Pretty good movie.
B000002BYD|4.0|What is it with people and all that Grunge talk. <br />What the heak is grunge? Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains and Nirvana in the early 90s? What the heak? Sounds more to me like \\"music\\". <br /> <br />Another stupid word to sum up music that is just talked about, more than actually listened, and how anyone could call this grunge is beyond sense anyway. <br />
B00005JNTX|2.0|And no, I'm not talking about good wine, but rather cheap crap.  Face it my \\"peeps\\" you've all be duped.  This so-called movie barely passes as a collection of moody pseudo-arty black-and-white poppycock.  My ex-boyfriend - yes, we split amicably and are still friends - told me that this movie was nothing more than a contractual obligation for Robert Rodriguez and partially funded by yes, your least favorite liberal and mine: Michael Moore.  The agenda is clear as many shots are taken at the Catholic Church.  Don't get me wrong, I'm far from Catholic but I still respect those people more than most religions.  Bruce has done far better work in movies like the \\"Die Hard\\" series, and let's face it this is basically the same performance he gave in \\"The Sixth Sense\\".  I for one preferred it the first time around.  Shame on Quentin Tarantino, who I hate besides, for making a bad movie worse.  This is the cinematic equivalent of toilet paper - wipe yourself.
B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act Is Pearl Jams most strongest album released yet. <br />The whole album plays very strongly and their are no interlude type tracks such as on \\"Yield\\" or \\"No Code\\" and production is far better sounding than the last (Binuaral) album. <br /> <br />(The only criticism would have to be the 2003 tour which if , you watch Live at the Garden DVD, it looks like the band have been having a bit of lazy time and getting slack) <br /> <br />But that aside this is by far the most solid and impressive album yet.
B00014NE62|5.0|The whole piece is highly artistic and tasteful. Extra bonus is Wilby, Grant and Graves were all very pretty boys back to those years. Initially, Wilby is not the most attractive one. But after watching it over and over again, his charm is getting irresistible.   <br /> <br />I haven't seen any of Wilby's late performance in Australia. Anyone knows how he is doing in UK? Sure he's a great actor but luck plays a main role in acting career. It's a comfort to see him in the interview in this special collection (maybe shot in 2003?) - he's still quite charming even though aged a little. <br /> <br />A ageless classic and can't recommend enough.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Well NIN really suit more to be a band that fits songs into a soundscape rather than a song, but Trent Reznor this time wanted to go for a new idea (which is the opposite of what anyone else has done in a funny way) and made actual songs and used melodies (he siad so in an interview) <br /> <br />Whether he will do it next time or not he does'nt know, but likely it will be a bit of both, well thats someones guess, which could be dead wrong. <br /> <br />Was it worth the wait, not really, so there you go: 3 stars.
B00005LC1H|5.0|John Cleese's tour-de-force is easily one of the greatest comedies ever to appear on TV. His masterful job as Basil will have you laughing throughout every episode.

B0000E2FLC|5.0|This concert ROCKS THE HOUSE!  An AC/DC fan at the tender age of 3 thanks to an aunt who happen to love BACK IN BLACK, I've followed them extensively (to the fineline of being either a fan or obsessed individual) over the years.  This is one of the highest points for them.  In NO BULL and STIFF UPPER LIP concerts, they would slowly slip into seeming like they were finally getting to their respected ages. <br /> <br />I doubt many overdubs were used in the mixing of the soundtrack, unless something happened with the audio and no other option was left but to overdub or replace. I think that the problem may perhaps be that some of the cameras were not shooting at the same speed as the others which can cause a mismatch to the audio.  OR  while editing the shots cut two fast to keep the timing of the audio right (I've seen these things happen before).  Also, there are many mikes place all around to catch the sound of the crowd and area ambiance as well as the fact Brian SHOUTS \\"Hey Mama!\\" which may explain why it got picked up.  <br /> <br />When doing a stereo downmix, especially to VHS(up until now that's been the only way to see this concert)...certain elements are lost and buried underneath other sound elements that have a few more frequecies left to remain audiable when competing with everything else in the mix (crowd, band, area ambiance...etc, etc.). This is very true of a 5.1 mix. <br /> <br />Everyone has to remember that Sony/Epic has only recently come to ownership of LIVE AT DONNINGTON.  Up until the start of the new century, ownership was strictly Warner Bros.  Sony/Epic have done LOADS to appeal to all AC/DC fans.  Remastered and repackaged albums with linear notes and some unseen photos/artworks, FAMILY JEWELS which has every video for AC/DC ever made up until the start of the 1990's (the rest have to wait until enough is ready for a follow-up which will give us the rest), LIVE AT DONNINGTON with Widescreen picture and 5.1 mix!  They want the material handled right for all fans. <br /> <br />As for different edits, it depends on the area you buy.  Some countries have a standard to meet or don't perfer certain things...so an alternative edit is nothing new.  As far as I can remember, this concert is basically the same you can find on the OOP Warner Video from the 90's.  Right down to Angus' strip tease... <br /> <br />This concert ROCKS THE HOUSE!  I hope that Sony/Epic will tackle LET THERE BE ROCK nextso Bon's concert film gets the same respect!

B000008M54|5.0|I really can't believe someone wrote a one star review for this album because they thought it was a \\"blues\\" album. My faith in humanity is only salvaged by albums such as this one. This is the kind of album that can truly change your life. I bought Fisherman's Blues when it came out and have not stopped listening to it yet. It is an album that seemed to capture a moment in the lives of truly impressive and talented people as they were going through life changes. Truly transcendent.
B000A3DFZE|3.0|If you like pop music, reggae and ballads, this record is good for you: all the songs are very well played and arranged. But if you look for Blues, get it somewhere else in Clapton's discography (\\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\", for example). <br /> <br />Riccardo Frau - Italy
B0009XT8YW|5.0|All tracks are newly remastered from original master tapes. The DVD side contains the entire album in *LPCM Stereo with an interview of Barbara and Barry Gibb on the original recording of \\"Guilty\\", filmed in 2005 during the recording of Barbara's new album. There is also a video performance of one of the songs (\\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\") from the new album included exclusively on this disc as a preview of the new album. There is also the video of \\"Guilty\\" from Streisand's TV Special \\"One Voice\\" filmed in 1986. A photo gallery of the original studio shots/outtakes is also here on the DVD side.<br /><br />It is amazing that after over 25 years, \\"Guilty\\" is still Streisand's largest selling album. Barry Gibb and his brothers have worked wonders with many female artists, but this is probably their best writing and production work (Grammy winners). Garnering 5 singles with 2 going to #1, this is Barbra's essential \\"pop\\" album. From the R&B laden title track to the softly, sultry \\"Run Wild\\", Streisand's voice is relished. The Gibb's really know how to focus on Barbra's strengths. The two duets are some of Barry Gibb's strongest vocals to date and all the songs are bouncy, pop masterpieces. Finishing off nicely with the extravagant \\"Make It Like A Memory\\", you'll just hit the 'play' button again. Great album. Great songs. Great memories.<br /><br />* The official term (sometimes abbreviated to 'PCM') for the high-quality stereo soundtrack found on most music DVDs. It refers to the most common digital recording process, first introduced with CD. In fact, DVD supports higher-resolution versions of LPCM than CD, the most common of which is 48kHz/16 bit (as opposed to CD's 44.1kHz/16 bit). It should be noted that LPCM Stereo is 'uncompressed', offering higher quality than such 'compressed' alternatives as Dolby Stereo (commonly used for feature films).
B000AADYRQ|5.0|If you liked \\"Give Up\\" then buy this album immediately.  If you think the move towards a more produced sound is going to piss you off, give you more major label woes, you might want to look elsewhere.  I don't know, pick up an old Neutral Milk Hotel album and gripe about how everyone is selling out.  Me, though, I think this is their best album in a few years.  They didn't lose any edge when they jumped onto the label, they just got a better studio for Chris Walla to work his magic.  My recommendation?  Buy the album.  Then again, I just like music, and if I can hear it better, more crisp, more produced, and hence, a better listen?  All the better.  As long as Atlantic doesn't try to change the whole thing Death Cab has going for them in their sound, then they're still one of the best groups around.
B00005ATQD|4.0|The general public just doesn't understand this movie.  They were expecting something flashy and maybe action as we were going to look at Tom Cruise and Nicole Kiddman and their \\"star power\\" was going to draw audiences unlike before.  But there were no explosions, no car chases, and literally not a lot of action.  This was not meant to be one of those movies, it was a train of thought with a heady, dreamlike atmosphere. <br /> <br />Tom Cruise is on a sort of spiritual journey, as he gets it into his head that he wants to cheat on his wife.  He is presented with several situations in which to cheat, but something goes wrong each time and he never physically does.  It's about temptations, having that wonderful little bauble dangling before you and it's just beyond your reach.  A part of us wants it, wants it so badly, but we have to practice some discipline.  Don't be greedy, don't be selfish, and don't talk yourself into thinking that just this one time won't hurt.  It might be deeply satisfying to eat that candy bar now, but in the end it's just a candy bar, you'll be jogging many miles to burn it off, and you're better off not eating it.   <br /> <br />Some criticism?  It's a LONG movie, and you get very restless throughout.  I wish they had given Nicole Kidman more of a part, as I think her cream long since rose above Tom's even before they broke up.  Due to lighting and camera shots, the movie also has somewhat of a dreamlike feeling.  Everything's a little fuzzy, your buzz never quite wears off, and it leaves you a little nausious from time to time. <br /> <br />

B000003TA4|5.0|Where would we be without Nirvana?  And don't pretend you were too cool for them.  All their material wasn't the most original ever penned.  Maybe their lyrics were inane.  They wanted to be a footnote, and they ended up being the last great rock band to close out the 20th century.  Suddenly we stopped having big hair and wearing flashy clothes, we suddenly saw the importance of being ernest.  Dave Grohl is a fantastic drummer, and a phenomenal talent as he has proven with The Foo Fighters today.  Krist Novacelic knew how to work the hell out of that base guitar and kept it together.  And Kurt.  Where to begin?    \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was the great anthem to the grunge years, with that one song we took a turn and never looked back.  That grabbed a whole generation right at the right moment of angst and catapulted us away.  You can hear them in every band today.  And don't pretend you were too cool, because you weren't.  You started wearing Doc Martin boots and flannel shirts and had a wallet chain dangling from your belt and had acne and greasy hair.  This was the great change.    This album is full of gems, the lesser apreciated I feel are \\"Drain You\\" and \\"Territorial Pissings\\".  And I love the final track, that strange little ballad of \\"Something In THe Way\\" that rocks you to sleep.  We feel Kurt's anger, his stomach pains, and his highs and lows of mood.  This was the album that changed us, made us take our anger and channel it into our future.  The first time I heard this I was 17.  I'm 30 now, and I still listen to this album.  I remember those years so well, and still feel their anger, and still love this album.  It's raw, abrasive and aggressive.
B00004YX39|4.0|There are many reviewers here that say this album is perfect and among their best. I can kind of see where they are coming from. The album is immaculate down to every last note. It's sonically similar to \\"Aja\\" as far as the jazz-rock template goes. The instrumental passages and arrangements are cleaner than clean. And that is part of the problem with this record - it's too perfect. What I mean by that is, is that the life has been sucked out of these songs. They are simply going through the motions for what seems to be their final album as Steely Dan (a break that would last 20 years). \\"Babylon Sisters\\", \\"Hey Nineteen\\" (peaking at #10) and \\"Time Out of Mind\\" (peaking at #13) are the notably strong cuts. The latter featuring a nearly inaudible guitar solo from Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. Being a fan of Dire Straits, I would have never known it was him if I hadn't read the credits. There's not too many flaws musically, but it's seriously flawed when it comes down to the lyrics. Past Dan albums were a lot of fun. They were albums that made you snicker, smile, drop your jaw, and at times, laugh out loud. The cynical sarcasm is stripped from \\"Gaucho\\" almost entirely (except for \\"Hey Nineteen\\"). One can only appreciate the massive amounts of mixing, arranging, producing, engineering and session musicians (work!!) that went into this album (There's a reason it won a Grammy for \\"Best Engineered Recording, Non Classical\\"). Any fan of their earlier records will notably miss lyrics as fun as this one - \\"Driving like a fool out to Hackensack / Drinking his dinner from a paper sack / He says I gotta see a joker / And I'll be right back.\\"
B0009XRZ9W|5.0|I took my 2 year old grandchild to this because I used to read the story to my son and thought it was a beautiful story. Even at the tender age of 2, my grandson was absolutely spellbound throughout the entire movie. He sat on the edge of his seat and barely uttered a word. When it was over he asked if we could see it again. I later bought the soundtrack for both of us, when I pushed \\"play\\" on my CD player and he heard the roar of the train and the clanging of the bells, he stopped dead in his tracks and said \\"the choo-choo train movie\\" almost melancholic.....he sat and listened for a few moments and said, \\"Grandma, can we see it again....PLEASE\\". I call that \\"MAGICAL\\" !! It will be a classic from this year on in my family and if you are wise enough to take your children and grandchildren; in your family too!!
0634060384|3.0|Most jazz musicians would call this a fake book, but the publishers obviously thought that \\"fake\\" in the title would give the wrong impression. And it would, because the book is real, and the idea that the elaborate tonal structures jazz musicians create only happen because they don't know how the tune is supposed to go is blatantly incorrect. Jazz musicians take the original melody or something close to it, as shown in this book, and do their best to make a real piece of music out of something the original \\"composer\\" just tossed off.
0767803434|5.0|I just wanted to say thanks. I actually ordered 4 movies that took over a month to get here probably since it sat in Sana for several weeks. And the package was opened before it got to me and I am sure it was becasue the country I live in. However, they all got here in great shape. I am glad to know that I can order movies now and that they will actually get to me. I will be ordering many more since I will be here for some time and I do not get many English speaking channels here. Thank for being there for me Amazon. Signed a truly satisfied customer.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I noticed quite a few reviewers claim this album is too repetitive.  Our French androids' last record, \\"Discovery,\\" was a very fun and poppy collection of songs that made you just want to dance and have a good time.  This new record is less danceable perhaps, and it's certainly not something you can sing along to, but this album has a certain beauty that puts you in a completely different state of mind.  That has always been the magic of Daft Punk. <br /> <br />The music is harder, darker, and filled with a broader range of emotion than Daft Punk has previously expressed.  The opening track, \\"Human After All,\\" becomes progressively more tense and seems to speak of a desperate search for identity in a cold world where technology is dehumanizing us, and I would call it my favorite Daft Punk song of all time.  This theme continues into tracks like \\"Television Rules The Nation.\\"  There are some dancey, active tracks as well, such as \\"Robot Rock\\" and the better known \\"Technologic\\" that flows like a well-oiled machine.  Tracks such as \\"Steam Machine\\" and \\"The Brainwasher\\" are harsh and busy like faceless cities where people are all plugged into their electronics and completely disconnected from what they were born with inside.  Then there are soft songs that surprised me, \\"Make Love\\" and \\"Emotion.\\"  These are dream-like melodies that remind one of simple times, simples touches, simple connections, memories that bring us hope on lonely nights while also reminding us that we are imperfect and in need of love. <br /> <br />\\"Human After All\\" is not something you can play at a party.  It is something you can zone out on, something that can put you in another world.  It is something to listen to while you are drawing or writing, while driving alone at night, while staring up at your ceiling in your room and wondering if you're the only person alive.  It is a powerful, introverted, emotional work and deserves another listen or two before you throw it back on the shelf.

B00006ADFL|2.0|BE WARNED! THIS IS NOT THE FILM YOU SAW IN THE THEATRE!<br /><br />Much to my surprise, this arrived with the small words \\"uncut version\\" on the cover, and to my dismay, this was not a good thing. Peter Jackson's brilliant film, which gave Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey what may be the two best debut roles ever for young women, was a non-stop roller-coaster ride of mounting hysteria that mirrored the increasing intensity of the girls' relationship. This friendship between Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker, which became deeply emotional, sexual, and ultimately so co-dependent that they simply could not tolerate the notion of separation, culminated in the violent murder of Pauline's mother, with the two girls bashing her head in repeatedly with a brick inside of a stocking(the scene is gruesome, but still understates reality, which is a shocking thing to learn). This crime shocked the quiet community of Christchurch, New Zealand so completely that Jackson starts his film with a propoganda movie the town had made to lure new residents, in order to give us an idea of what sort of place this was. He then begins to fade in screams of the girls, shots of their blood-streaked faces, and we are as shocked by the violence as the town was then (1954). In order to understand and sympathize with these girls, not an easy thing for a director to accomplish given the violence of their crime and the inability of such smart girls to find any other way to deal with their terror of separation, Jackson gets deep inside their heads very effectively, and more than sharing their fantasy world with us, takes us into it. And by keeping the pace of the film pumping along with such speed and focus that we feel the girls' pain, too, and almost in spite of ourselves, are completely in sympathy with their decision (although afterwards, we shake ourselves back into rationality, and wonder why they came to such a desperate conclusion), we accept the racing towards inevitability that they seemed to have felt. The tension and intensity are incredible, and without it, the film would never have worked.<br /><br />The original cut of \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" gave us what we needed to maintain within ourselves this hysteria and to see from their points of view without stopping to question. This \\"uncut version\\" destroys that completely. It contains a 10-15 minute section that doesn't exist in the theatrical release, and which stops the film dead. The scenes are also longer, there's more dialogue in some, more time in \\"The Fourth World\\" (their fantasy world), and the editing is considerably less elegant. While some of these scenes add to our understanding of the girls, especially the rather bizarre details of Juliet's family life, and are therefore interesting to see, it's not the cut I'll watch again and again, as I do the original. It just doesn't work, and sadly, unless you realize that this wasn't the work of genius everyone was raving about, you'll wonder why we were raving about it. I don't believe anyone would have raved about this version, especially as the anguish of the ending is wrecked by an incredibly bad editing decision. Certainly I would not have raved about it, even if I could have seen its potential for genius.<br /><br />It is very frustrating that now one can only get this version--there isn't even a choice between the two. I don't understand why this wasn't released in a two-sided or two-disk \\"pick a version\\" manner, or the extended/deleted scenes shown as \\"deleted scenes\\" often are on the original DVD. That this is the only choice now is infuriating, especially as, with no warning, one may discover it as I did, watching the opening sequence and thinking, \\"Wait a minute...I don't remember this...\\" While not everyone is like me with a photographic memory that genuinely knows films by heart, even noticing a different single edit in a scene if the film shows up on TV, most who loved this film will realize they're watching something different, and probably will only notice it after it's in the DVD player, making getting credit for a return more of a challenge. But the fact that this is not the original version is not, in my opinion, sufficiently explained in the information on the DVD info page. That this is NOT the original version should be shouted, as unlike \\"Apocalypse Now Redux,\\" it is not re-titled.<br /><br />The comparison to \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is actually an appropriate one. In the Redux version, we can see scenes that add background about Vietnam (the presence of old French colonialist families still living there, for example), interesting conversations, etc., but its pace is deadly, and as with \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" we need to be on a voyage of inevitability, moving relentlessly towards the mysterious Kurtz. Without this ever-mounting tension, it's not the work of genius that the original cut is. But we have choices between the two, and that's as it should be. Why the extra and extended scenes in \\"HC\\" weren't just in a \\"deleted scenes\\" section on the original disk is a mystery, but this poor replacement is a disappointment that now is the only version first-time viewers can see without buying second-hand. Bad, bad call.<br /><br />A note: Editing is everything. Everything. I learnt how to build a film from my editing teacher (who became my editor); it's in the editing that the film is either made or broken, and obviously Jackson knew that, and made all the right choices with his editor the first time around. Why he ruined his own work is a question someone should ask him.

B000001GAM|5.0|I don't remember a bad,poor or ordinary performance from Giulini's catalogue.This performance is also truly great:Powerful,glorious and spectacular..Tragic crescandos,exciting  coda of first movement and firm in structure.This is a live recording(1988-DDD) but better than many studio recordings.There are only two great interpretations among digital accounts and both are live performings:Giulini 1988 and Celibidache 1995 with MP(on different-way)... As a great Bruckner fan I bought or listened all important performings (from B.Walter, Schuricht and Van Beinum to Solti, Wand-BP-live, Haitink, C.Davis, Tate etc.) and according to me there are ''a few'' great Brucknerian conductor on the ''great performing'' of the Ninth: Kabasta (1942-MP,live,historical recording,for collectors), Jochum(1964-BP and 1978-SD), Celibidache(1995-MP,live), Wand(1978-Koln), Karajan(1966-BP) and 'undoubtly' Giulini(1976-CSO, this 1988-WP-live and 1996-SWR Stuttgart-live)...Do not miss.
B000002GJH|5.0|Well, what were you expecting? You add two of the greatest bands from the 90's (among my favorites, as well) and you get an amazing record. It's simple math, really. <br /> <br />For those who don't know of the tragic story, well, you can probally read what the reviewers have said, but I will tell you anyways. By 1990, the grunge movement was growing rapidly by the day. Mother Love Bone was a band whos famous/infamous members included Jeff Ament (PJ bass), Stone Gossard (PJ rhythm guitar), and Andy Wood. On March 19,1990 Andy Wood died of an apparent heroin overdose.  <br /> <br />Long story short, Chris Cornell (Soundgarden vocals), a good friend of Andy Woods, brought together Matt Cameron (Soundgarden drums), Mike McCready (Pearl Jam lead guitar), Stone Gossard (Pearl Jam rhythm guitar), and Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam vocals), for this intensly emotional album. It is nothing like the great album Soundgarden put out later that year, Badmotorfinger, but sounds more like an album Pearl Jam would have put out in the middle of their career. <br /> <br />If there is one thing that stands out on this album, its most definitely the vocals that Chris Cornell so gracefully exerts. The pain of Say Hello 2 Heaven, the famous duo with Vedder on Hunger Strike, the bluesy tone in Call me A Dog, and the operatic power on Times of Trouble and Four Walled World is just flatout amazing. Never, in other album, does a singer produce this many high caliber performances.  Cornell is truly one of the greatest rock vocalists to have lived. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the only songs from this album to get significant radio-play are Say Hello 2 Heaven and Hunger Strike. This album is full of gems. Reach Down with its intensity and nasty guitar licks from McCready. Call me A Dog with its romantic aura, and a scream that is the father of all screams. Times of Trouble with its depressing harmonica, and Cornells somber, yet powerful baritone. Wooden Jesus with its passionate metaphors. Oh yeah, Iforgot to mention the lyrics on this album. Great stuff. Metaphors galore. Four Walled World is a vocal showcase in which Cornell will wail you out of your chair. <br /> <br />The point is, this is truly one of the greatest albums of the 90's, and is sad that it doesn't receive the attention it should. It might take you a few trips to find it in a store, but I assure you that upon buying it you will be mystified, whether it is by Cornells undeniable vocal talent, McCreadys screaming guitar, the lyrics, or simply the many great melodies that appear on this album. o_O
0060934719|5.0|Neil Gaiman has written another fun and enjoyable book on the Faerie.  This time a young man has promised his love to fetch a star that has fallen into the land of the faerie to win her heart. Young Tristan marches into the land of the faerie.  What he does not know is that there are others looking for the same star for their own reasons.  One is two brothers fighting for the right to rule their kingdom and the other is a witch that needs to have the star for everlasting youth.<br /><br />Once again Neil Gaiman has mixed both \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and \\"Grimms Fairy Tales\\" wonderfully.  He reminds me of Terry Pratchet for bringing vivid characters to life even if they are only in the story for a cameo.  The characters are both very light and very dark.  The bad guys are very bad and the good guys are characters.  Just reading the story will let you know that it will be alright in the end, even if the ending is not what you expected.  This book is both fun and light reading.  It is good for both adults and \\"tweeners\\" and is truly a good read.  Highly Recommended.
0142000663|5.0|I have been reading and re-reading this book for last couple of weeks and haven't been able to get over it. The backdrop, the politics, the facts behind the fiction, are all a different world to me. Separated by several decades. Yet, there are factors that connect you straight to the book. Tom is a man who reminds you of someone you wanted to be in school after being expelled. Ma stands for strength in adversity. Pa for being an understanding human being.<br /><br />Amidst everything, the characters Steinbeck has created are  ephemeral yet so touchingly representative of human strength and dignity. The language of the characters is also communicative of the understanding of the lot Steinbeck has wanted to portray. The Scriptures' discussion between Tom and Ma when she comes to ask him to go (and her understanding the fact that children, especially adoloscents are likely to make mistakes in the heat of the moment) has a stark resemblance to the discussion of Indian scriptures I have overheard travelling to my village. It makes you wonder about the irony that when you are engrossed in reading such stories in fiction, you get appalled. But when you are just skipping through the newspapers, you miss the stories. There are quite a few Joads living out there, but we do not have the time to read through the stories in between the lines of the news columns.<br /><br />To sum it up, Grapes of Wrath is like a huge picture on a very large canvass that portrays the human life with a perspective that is way larger than we choose to adopt towards life. A must read.
0060763280|5.0|Ever listen to hours of tapes and sum it up with, \\"... if you want what someone else has, do what they do.\\" Great. What if you want to be wealthy? Do you know anyone who is wealthy, and you can call them. Great. Terrific. I don't know Donald Trump, even though he is from my old neighborhood. There are  many well to do people I've heard of, but I don't know them. T. Harv Eker writes about the similarities all wealthy people have. It is their thoughts. It is the ideas they share. I'm reading this book for the second time, just to focus on changing my poor thinking mode. If wealth interests you, buy this book. And READ it. Study it. Do not just buy it, use it.
B000002I2I|5.0|I suppose this has always been the dark horse in the Doors library; an album less known to casual fans (\\"classic rock\\" radio listeners) and the more die hard fan, but it has always been my second-favorite album, after \\"L.A. Woman\\" (even though this one, taken as a whole, is much stonger than \\"L.A. Woman\\", but since the title cut is the single best rock and roll song that I've ever heard, it gets the edge). Like the other reviewers have stated, this is a more pared down, rock and roll album, with no \\"Touch Me\\" type moments. The songs range from out and out rockers (\\"Roadhouse Blues\\") to those sort of creepy, unsettling songs that only The Doors could pull off (\\"The Spy\\"), as well as some of the band's most enigmatic and beautiful little pieces (\\"Indian Summer\\", \\"Blue Sunday\\"). My personal favorite has always been \\"Land Ho!\\", and I've always wondered if it was somehow directed at Morrison's father. The musicianship is top notch and Morrison's diction is perfect: <br />Well if I get my hands ona dollar bill/gonna buy a bottle 'n' drink my fill <br />If I get my hands ona number five/gonna skin that little girl alive <br />If I get my hands ona number two/come back home and marry you! Marry you! Marry you alright...
B00092ZMDY|3.0|I loved the concert on NBC and truly enjoyed it. <br />But not being able to get the concert on CD is really unfortunate. Joe Walsh's new song was the highlight of the entire show. I grew up during their 70's tours and went to several of them. I would have loved to have seen them once more live. I'm sorry to the guy who said \\"Goodbye Forever\\" Eagles. <br />The reason the Eagles have remained so popular is obvious. <br />The write and play GREAT music.. <br />Sorry you don't agree. <br />
B00003CXDG|5.0|No need to make much words: THE SINGLE BEST ACTION MOVIE...EVER. Woo and Cruise are an incredible team, turning a standard Hollywood action scenario into an overwhelming work of art. John Woo's pictures are unparalleled and burst of magic, subtext and sheer visual power whilst keeping a very distinct touch unlike any other director's. He loads every frame with metaphors and has a fantastically talented eye for angles, speed, cuts, effects and expression. Tom Cruise, while somewhat limited in expression as an actor, plays the role he plays best (and does a quite good job with it) and contributes insane stunts that add a previously unseen intensity to the action scenes so far not matched by any other action movie. Add a story which is at least as complex as better James Bond movies (hence no insult to the viewer's intellect) and impressive co-actors. Dougray Scott gives a memorable performance as the charismatic villain (definitely a more noteworthy actor), and Thandie Newton convincingly makes the most of her role. Especially these two (though it would be unfair not to mention that Tom Cruise adds to this, too) bring the tensions and intrigues constructed by Robert Towne and John Woo to life thus helping create a very dense athmosphere. Overall, this is a larger-than-life, overwhelming movie, a modern fairytale, full of metaphors, technically extremely sophisticated and yet \\"real\\", nearly raw. Very emotional and yet credible (even though what we see is absolutely not). A masterpiece of the genre, and possibly Cruise's and Woo's best work. And, to say it again, overwhelming.
B00005JN5X|4.0|This was still an enjoyable film despite what several viewers disliked about it. Terry Gilliam still suceeds in puting in his own visual flare and humor into his latest effort.  This film is similiar to his earlier \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchauson\\" in the fact that they both deal  with believing in the unbelievable in an age of growing cynicism. Through the    stories of an aging adventurer in Munchauson and now the exploits of two con men who profit  off of those who do believe in the unbelievable. In that respect Gilliam succeeds in conveying those themes. <br />
B00005JNTX|1.0|This movie was a major dissapointment.  It's in black and white except for the color red and yellow.  What kind of crap is this? <br /> <br />I was very upset at this, for it seemed very \\"fake\\" and cartoonish. <br /> <br />Stay away from this movie unles you like Black and white movies. <br /> <br />I wish I could get my money back.
B00049QQHI|4.0|Leornardo Di Caprio plays Jim Carrol in this movie. He's young,famous and a great basktellball player. Between things, he writes a book daily or whenever he can. He suffers from depression when his best friend dies of cancer. Then on, he adopts drugs and ruins his high school life.<br /><br />The movie is quick and the screenplay is hard hitting and incredibly entertaining. The most gulp inducing scene in the film features Jim crying outside his mom's appartment before getting arrested. It always strikes me how Di Caprio has this superhuman side to him. He can undertake any role you throw at him. The end of this movie was heartening and inspiring in a way.<br /><br />My other favourite Leonardo Di Capro films are  Aviator (absolute 5 starrer) Catch Me If You Can (of course you've seen it) and Titanic(overrated? hell no) He also happens to be my favourite actor besides Tom Hanks.<br /><br />Overall rating for Basketball Diaries,7/10
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Death Cab is a band that while evolving, has maintained an original sound. To me, they are the most consistent talented band in the indie rock scene today. And I can't think of another band that sounds like them. It's weird because i really wanted to try to find a current band like them. In the 90s, I was listening to Texas is the reason, Promise Ring, Sunny Day, etc and I guess Death Cab fell into that category of music, but now I have become a lot more open to other types of music including a lot of independent hip hop artists such as Aesop, and MF doom as well as experimental artists like Sigur Ros and Explosions in the Sky, and I can say that Death Cab is still one of my favorite bands. My favorite tracks off this cd are \\"Your Heart is an Empty Room\\" and \\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\". If you liked Transatlanticism, you'll like this because it feels like a good sequel to that cd. 4 stars, thanks
0399152717|4.0|I've read many, though not all, of Cussler's books.  I think Polar Shift, his latest, is probably one of his best. It reminds me of Raise the Titanic in story development and interesting technology.  Fast paced, gripping and believable storyline, great characters, interesting locations...Polar Shift has it all.<br /><br />In the real world, scientists are certain that the magnetic poles on the earth have, in fact, changed in the distant past.  In Polar Shift modern day bad guys are planning on using theories developed in the 30's by a brilliant scientest to cause the poles to shift and thereby drive all of modern society into chaos.  All electronics will become useless, power grids will fail, navigation will become almost impossible.  Your compass needle won't point to the north, but will point south instead.  The purpose behind all this???  Money, what else?<br /><br />Cussler does a good job selling the idea that this can happen at almost any time naturally.  He also convinces the reader that it could BE MADE to happen, by evil guys for profit.<br /><br />Polar Shift is a wonderful read.  The NUMA regulars are back along with some really interesting bad guys. If you've enjoyed other Cussler books, then you know what to expect.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Gilmore Girls is uniquely poised as the first show to really integrate little-known rock bands seamlessly into episodes, making this a great sampler not only of music from the show, but of the best in indie music (along with a few standards, of course). \\"Our Little Corner\\" includes a great selection of songs from the first two seasons, as well as Sam Phillips' inspired cues. <br />As a fanatic follower of the show, I know of a few tracks I would have liked to see here, but overall it's a good representation. As a music fan, it's a bit scattered--when was the last time you saw Carole King, Joey Ramone, and Bjork together?--but still coherent enough to be fun. And, as previously mentioned, it's a great way to pick up tracks you might not find in your local music store's pop-rock section.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|First off I'd like to say to anyone who thinks that if a band signs to a major label then they are a \\"Sell-Out\\".... Wake up, and grow up. You are not in high school anymore, and no one thinks you're cool b/c you wear dirty clothes and don't comb your hair...or b/c you listen to \\"underground\\" music. Music is music, if you like it, then it's good music no matter what label produces it. I say kudo's to Death Cab, they're grown up now and need more space and more room to grow up more! That aside, Plans, thier latest effort is a great album. It's as good if not better than any of thier previous albums. Although it does seem like a mixture of Postal Service and Death Cab's sound - but how could that be bad??? The lyrics are excellent! Songs like Summer Skin will take many of you back to a fond memory of your teenage years, or early adulthood. That same nostalgic feel reveberates throughout the rest of the album as well. This is a must have for any Death Cab fan and if you aren't a fan, then apparently you haven't heard DCFC before! So make PLANS to pic this one up!
B0000B1OFN|4.0|If you haven't heard of director F. Gary Gray, you will. This remake really shares nothing but a name with the original, but that's forgivable when the reincarnation is this good. Without ruining too much, how often do you get to see marquee actors play chicken with helicopters under a parking garage?!? <br />What really makes this DVD stand out, though, is the special features. Sure there's the \\"making of\\" and \\"deleted scenes\\", but there's also quite a bit on teaching actors to drive and do stunts, meaning all of the shots in the movie are real--no green screens, no stuntmen, no stand-ins. Combined with an \\"easter egg\\" extended version of Napster's rant about Handsome Rob, this is the \\"guy movie\\" DVD to end all guy movies..

B000063VST|5.0|This is essentially the \\"Room for Squares\\" CD with \\"Lenny\\" and \\"Wind Cries Mary\\" added at the end.  Both are live tracks recorded in the \\"X Lounge\\" in Birmingham, AL for an audience of contest winners.  Those two songs were on a bonus disc given out at one point with purchase of the CD and can usually be found for download at one of your favorite online spots. :)
0141439513|4.0|Even though Jane Austen might sound stuffy and old fashioned, her enthralling novel Pride and Prejudice is as pleasing today as it was in the 1800's when it was written. The story is all about two girls-Jane and Elizabeth Bennet- and their trials and tribulations in middle-class, snobby English society. Austen uses sophisticated word choices and witty remarks to portray what life was really like, and how everything wasn't always as it seemed. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, finds herself caught up in an elaborate love triangle--involving her sister, Jane, a wealthy, intelligent gentleman named Mr. Charles Bingley, and a plot to tear the two lovers apart. As the story goes on, more and more is revealed about who is responsible for breaking up the budding romance between her sister and Bingley. In the middle of all of this, Elizabeth finds that she has fallen in love with the man that ruined sister's relationship. With a tangled web of lies and deceit, the tale takes a sharp turn from entertaining anecdote to a gripping suspense story. Will she tell her sister who is responsible for the breakup? Will she continue her romance with the man that has made her sister so unbelievably miserable? All in all, the story is a riveting piece of art that shouldn't be taken for granted just because it sounds boring.

B0009HLDFU|2.0|Stupid me, I bought this without checking the back of the case where it states that you cannot play this album where ever you want. I got this about 2 months ago and I haven't listened to it since the ride home from the store. I use my iPod and iTunes constantly and I can't play this on either. I could listen to it in my CD player in the car but I'm just too frustrated with this crap to even enjoy it. I can't believe the industry thinks this is how to curb \\"illegal\\" downloading. Well all this does for me is encourage me to download. I'm not paying for songs from iTunes because if I pay for an album I want that album and art work physically in my hands. So where am I left...downloading on my own. So great job RCA and BMG you have just encouraged me to download songs off the internet. Here are a few of amazing albums that RCA/BMG think you shouldn't be able to listen too: <br />Velvet Revolver - Contraband <br />Kings of Leon - Aha Shake Heartbreak <br />Silvertide - Show & Tell <br />Sahara Hotnights - Kiss & Tell <br />
B0000027RL|5.0|The early 1990s saw a change in Rock music and the emergence of several great new rock bands.  Pearl Jam was among them, releasing Ten as their debut album.  While Pearl Jam may not be as big today as they once were, Ten remains one of the great rock albums ever made and could very well be the best rock album of the 90s (especially the early 90s).  If you are a lover of music and/or rock you must own this album.
B00005KB9X|5.0|Allow me to open this review with an outrageously bold statement: This is Bob Marley and the wailers' BEST album. It is comprised almost entirely of songs that could make another best of in themselves. Why? well, there are several reasons: <br /> <br />This is by far marley's 'heaviest' album. By this i mean that many of the songs are bold, threatening roots reggae. Just listen to \\"Them Belly Full\\" or \\"Revolution\\" to see what i mean by this. Having said this, this album is still skanking, and there are still the love songs, and the peaceful melodic reggae we all know and love Uncle Bob for. <br /> <br />The Wailers, as a band, on this album, definitely challenge Bob for being the cornerstone of this great album. There are some great harmony pieces with the I-threes (check out \\"Talkin' Blues\\"), the keyboards are great, drumming as good as ever, but the real difference for me is none other than... Familyman. He is truly amazing on this album, and in my mind steals the show from Marley on this album. His fat, funky bass riffs could keep me skanking all night long, and it makes the album worth listening to over and over again. The fact that he does this on every track, regardless of the vibe of the track, be it heavy and threatening, or peaceful and slow, he finds the right riff to get you on your feet. <br /> <br />For some reason, the songs on this album have never really made it to a best of. I dont understand why, because in a way, this album is a best of in itself. It was the 1st Bob released after the split with Bunnie and Peter, and it's still one of his most solid efforts. Quite seriously, at least 6 of the 10 songs here have never seen a best of album, and deserve to be on one. Having said this, maybe thats a good thing, to make this album a secret treasure trove of Bob's greatest roots reggae.  <br /> <br />This album is a welcome change, for me, from the stereotypical greatest album of bob's, exodus. Dont get me wrong, the album is great, but i get sick of hearing those songs when you hear them on every one of the greatest hits albums released under his name, and i think there are at least three or four now. Natty dread is jam-packed with some of the best reggae I've ever heard, in every style: there's the heavy revolutionary threatening sounds of \\"Them Belly Full\\", \\"Rebel Music\\", and my personal favourite \\"Revolution\\", the funkier lighter songs like \\"Lively up Yourself\\", \\"Natty Dread\\" (a close second on my list)and \\"Talkin Blues\\", and the love songs that this band does so well : \\"Bend down low\\" and \\"Am-a-do\\" (this one is really great for a bonus track). <br /> <br />Let me put it this way: if you want a near flawless album (the only average song on here is the studio version of no woman no cry) that will surprise you with how awesome it sounds, despite how little known the album is, buy Natty Dread, crank it up loud and light one up for Uncle Bob. <br /> <br />
0312335164|4.0|The first two Dan Brown Books I read were \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons,\\" so going into Digital Fortress I was expecting more of the same.  However, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is definately more of a thriller then a mystery, the way \\"Code\\" and \\"A&D\\" were.  Brown still manages to write with the detail and excitement you read in his other novels.  If you like Dan Brown or thrillers in general then you will like this book.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I used to be into lots of very bad music, bad bad bad. But a friend of mine has sort of shaped my musical taste, and this was the first CD he gave to me (An accident of sorts, due to the fact he bought two more copies than he needed). So, I took the CD, thinking,\\" eh, it'll probably be interesting.\\" So I listened to it, and with the simple mind that I had, I just couldnt wrap my mind around the gem that I held before me, so I put it away in my CD case. A few weeks later, I went on vacation, and I decided to listen to it again. I was amazed by everything going on in this album, I kept listening to it, and listening to it, everything opening up around me, it was beautiful. So, if you want to improve your musical taste and expand your mind, pick this one up, it's absolutely amazing and definitely deserves a spot in history as one of the greatest albums, EVER!
B00005JNEW|5.0|Having went to a 4-5A High School (Permian's old Football District) and played against them, Lee High, Cooper, and Co I look at this movie and think back to my old playing days.  I was 8 the year \\"FNL\\" took play and I can still remember sitting in front of the TV the following year watching Permian win state.  While I was skeptical of \\"FNL\\" being heralded as one of the great sports films of all time, I can say after having seen it and now owning it that this is very much a true statement.  IMHO it is probably the greatest football movie ever made.
B00009OKOC|5.0|This is a wonderful Album. What I find interesting is that it almost has this cinematic quality to it,such as the amazing beginning of \\"You think I aint worth a dollar but I feel like a millionaire\\" to the brilliant conclusion in \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" which is probably one of my favorite songs ever from any band. It's funny to because a lot of people think that the whole radio tone of the cd is offsetting, but I find its a great way to pull people in because it's such a great peice and so interesting to listen to. The only song I dont like is \\"Hanging tree\\" I just think its too out of place and ruins the vibe of the rest of the CD, but, overall, this is one great CD that anyone who wants a good time listening to rock should definitely pick up.
B000063CPL|5.0|This is a great album. Giving it anything lower than 5 starts would be an injustice. A lot of people like to compare Rock in Rio to Live After Death and most people bring up the fact that LAD has a better tracklist and thus is the superior album. I agree, LAD does have a better tracklist, but then again, I rather have some variation in live albums, and this album does just that.     In Rock in Rio, Maiden delivers a great performance with a mixture of old Maiden songs and newer songs. You get the classic songs that are essential to every Maiden concert such as The Trooper, Number of the Beast, Hallowed be Thy Name, etc., but you also get songs that will probably never be on any other live album such as Ghost of the Navigator, Blood Brothers, Sign of the Cross, The Mercenary, Dream of Mirrors and The Clansman, all of which are great songs that surpass their studio versions. The only song that suffers a little bit is The Wicker Man because of Bruce's voice, but after that, Bruce gives the best vocal performance from any other live Maiden album. He even nails the chorus in Run to the Hills, which is a song that he usually struggles with in other live albums.     My favorite part of the album is the way that Bruce feeds off of the ecstatic crowd and in a way manipulates them. On many occasions, I would get the chills from hearing such a big crowd screaming out of the top of their lungs while singing along to some classic Maiden anthems. I especially love the \\"Freedom!\\" chorus in The Clansman.    This album is worth every penny and is essential if you're a Maiden fan! Rock in Rio has great production and it is different from any other live Maiden album. Purchase it! It's worth every penny.
B000A7Q2DM|2.0|Listening to the first song for a few moments, I already knew that this album was not going to be like their first. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" has a few good moments, but most of it isn't as explosive or captivating as their first. There is a lot of screaming, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of feeling behind it. The songs are pretty slow-paced. <br /> <br />What this album seems to be is a failed attempt at recreating the power and sound of the self-titled album, only adding more feelings and emotions (notice the roses all over the album art?). <br /> <br />The CD doesn't seem to work with Windows Media Player on my computer. Also, the copy protection allows you to copy or burn the album a maximum of three times, apparantly. <br /> <br />This album is largely boring and nothing special. I hate to say it. The bonus tracks, however, are pretty good.
B000002J09|4.0|Let's look at the situation objectively.<br /><br />Not regarding if this is led zeppelin's best or worst album (who cares), this is a classic good rock album.<br /><br />It doesn't blow an average rock fan's head away, nor does it leave you indifferent.<br /><br />It is a solid, above average rock-album and if you generally don't like led zeppelin, you'll hate it, but if you do like them, you'll love it.<br /><br />Needless to say, if you're a fan, you'll worship it.<br /><br />I'm personally a pink floyd fan, but i still manage to be objective about them, and i can't understand why zep fans can't do that as well?!<br /><br />Be objective, they're only human!
B0007TKNL0|1.0|Having seen this movie on a huge screen at the Zeigfeld in NYC, I can honestly say that I gave it my best shot. The casting is hideous, emmy rossum is obviously a terrible singer, if she sang at the Met, she must have been in the children's chorus, because that's exactly what she sounds like. The casting of the Phantom is insipid and ridiculous. The only good casting is that of Patrick Wilson, his portrayal seems real and heartfelt, and of Minnie Driver, although I was saddened to hear that her singing was dubbed. Her speaking and acting made the film for me. I used to like this show, what with it being the closest thing to grand overblown opera on broadway, but this movie really sucks. The singing is bad, the dancing is AWFUL, it all looks like Madonna-esque voguing with no real thought behind it, the original choreography was much better. Why do people think they can improve on what people like so much already? I mean, its drivel to begin with, but it had style. In this film, the style is caricatured and cheapened. Do yourself a favor, get another movie.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Musicians have always taken a lead role in helping out when there is a need. Sir Bob Geldorf's Live Aid captures the spirit of giving and solidarity so well.  Even if you weren't born when this concert took place, this set is worth having, as it is a testament to what marvelous things can be accomplished if we all work together.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|<br /> <br />So, fans of alternative metal and especially Slipknot were looking forward to the group's new album, Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses. Released in May 2004, it was definitely one of the highlights of the year in metal world. Now that there is a year and a half passed since its release, we can look back and write a more thorough and closer-to-truth review. <br /> <br />I don't pretend to present the only right opinion, but what my friends said about Vol 3: TSV mostly corresponds with my thoughts, so here they are. <br /> <br />The pros: <br /> <br />- I bet noone has something against the fact that the album is well-crafted. The band has really tried hard, packing the disk with 14 songs, 60 minutes of music, different song structures, different rhythms, tempos, riffs, distortions, even solos and so on, there is quite a large quantity of lyrics and different genres were attempted to be covered. What deserves special mentioning are the instruments, to be more precise, the production that allows each band member to be heard upon listening. <br /> <br />- Slipknot have developed their sense of melody, which already started to show on Iowa (Left Behind, My Plague). It is certainly no selling out, and definitely a good thing. The choruses can now realy be named CHORUSES, with a few exceptions(tracks 1, 7, for instance), flow nicely. <br /> <br />- The band has managed to write several good songs that are heavy, fast, agressive and melodic as well (tracks 2,3,4), which is realy rarely seen in music nowadays (take Korn's last album, for example, which in my opinion has only one decent headbanging track - Y'All Want A Single); thus, the album sounds comparatively fresh. <br /> <br />Seems a superb record, yeah? But unfortunately now we have to move on to the cons, and there are quite many of them: <br /> <br />- Well, the basic problem is that the album isn't actually more than the sum of its parts: somehow it fails to be cohesive and expressive. Nor it brings enough anger, adrenaline and catharsis that it is needed for an alternative metal album. The songs' elements that are strong themselves don't often flow together (especially evident on tracks 5, 7, 10). On the whole, it seems that Vol 3: TSV wasn't insired effort, despite all the rumours about 'haunted house atmosphere', the band 'back together' - the feeling which we all were looking for, which was found on their debut, is missing. They have included two acoustic songs (tracks 6, 11) which are ok, but somehow don't suit the group's attitude and image, and it makes an effect upon listening to the album. Remember - harmony cannot be calculated. Overall, the record seems to be easier to appreciate than to love - a bad thing for an alternative album. <br /> <br />- Verses in many songs are barely descendible from each other and basically consist of mere screaming, which supposedly many fans will like, but makes the album repetitive for wider audience. <br /> <br />- Just like the above mentioned Korn, Slipknot (or, more accurately, its vocalist Corey Taylor) is in a kind of a stalemate with its lyrics which cover only one emotion - anger - and don't tend to differ from album to album which is a shame, as the record cetrainly would've been more adventurous and exciting if Corey had thought of something more innovative than lines like 'The only thing I ever really loved was hate'. <br /> <br />So what do we get? I think Vol 3: TSV is a record that will certainly have a wider audience than two previous Slipknot albums and many will definitely enjoy it, as the disk is packed with high-quality heavy music that surpasses most other bands' work (Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Staind, Disturbed, even Korn, but also Slayer, Helmet, Soulfly and the like). However, many 'maggots' (die-hard fans) could be disappointed because that certain something is missing.  <br /> <br />If you want something more energetic, take Limp Bizkit (preferably first two albums), if you're looking for more experimental stuff, I would advise Ill Nino or Incubus (though the latter is significantly mellower), if you like goth/industrial, listen to Type O Negative or Marilyn Manson, if you would like to listen to something more complex and emotional, try Deftones or Tool. But Vol 3: TSV is a combination of these styles, so maybe you should listen to it first. Good luck and take a look on my opinions on tracks. <br /> <br />1. Prelude - 3/5. This is mellow, starting well but going nowhere. Cold've been a minute shorter. <br />2. The Blister Exists - 4.5/5. A cool fast song with terrific groove, the first of the triad. Chorus and pre-chorus are intoxicatingly headbanging. What for me ruins this song a little bit is the overusage of drums, but I think many of you will certainly like the solo in the middle. <br />3. Three Nil - 5/5. Superb, it will blow you away. This includes several great riffs/hooks in the beginning, but the second half of the song is actually even better with fantastic chorus and bridge. <br />4. Duality - 5/5. Even better. This is the most melodic track on the album and the first single. A cool driving song.  <br />5. Opium Of The People - 3.5/5. Featuring good riffs and melody in the chorus, this song is copletely devoid of any point or flow and too chaotic. <br />6. Circle - 2.5/5. In my humble opinion, this acoustic track is inexpressive and worth skipping. And  what the hell is the purpose of the drums at the end? <br />7. Welcome - 3/5. Heavy and intense, but lacks melody. <br />8. Vermillion - 5/5. Wow, this song has atmosphere. Really cool mellower  goth-sounding love song. <br />9. Pulse Of The Maggots - 4/5. Respect to Slipknot for writing an anthem for their fans. Unfortunately, this is not a highlight, but a decent song nevertheless. <br />10. Before I Forget - 3.5/5. Awesome pre-chorus, chorus and bridge that simply don't suit together. I don't understand this song, it could've been much better. <br />11. Vermillion Pt.2 - 4/5. Some emotional lyrics in this love song, but the overall impression isn't too good - acoustic songs aren't Slipknot's cup of tea. Better that 'Circle' though. <br />12. The Nameless - 4/5. This decent song marries heavy screamed verses with very mellow, even poppy chorus which makes it pretty entertaining. <br />13. The Virus Of Life - 4/5. An industrial song which is quite slow, but well-suited at the end of the album. It also somehow manages to actually express musically what it is about. <br />14. Danger - Keep Away - 3/5. This piano-driven album closer seems underwritten and boring, definitely can't stand up to Scissors or Iowa. Besides, it's too short and without any musical development. The album could've ended on a better note.    <br />
B00009P1O2|5.0|As a long time, Queen fan, I can honestly say that this is a must have!
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Great album, as usual the songs have amazing lyrics.  My favorite song on here is Soul Meets Body.
B0002858YS|5.0|Now I'm not some wanna be \\"hipster\\" that just goes out and buys a cd when they first hear it on MTV. I had purchased this album a few weeks after it came out because i thought that they sounded pretty cool, and i was right its a good album. \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is a good song, but it gets stuck in your head for periods of time, and eventually gets annoying. If you buy the album just because of \\"Somebody Told Me\\" youll quickly forget about it because it doesnt compare to their other good songs. If your not going to buy the cd but are looking for some of their better songs to download, I would recomend \\"All these things that Ive done\\" and \\"change your mind\\". All and all its a good release of an album, but i would recomend buying the deluxe edition with the three new songs because \\"The Ballad of Michael Valentine\\" is alot better than most of their songs.cheers.
0897500482|5.0|This book was incredibly fun to read, and I think that it should be kept this way.  You cannot learn martial arts from this book, and furthermore, the introduction of the book suggests that Bruce, himself, had qualms about releasing it because he figured that people would use it improperly.  This book doesn't teach martial arts, but rather is an outline of various principles underlying them...principles that are best to be absorbed and experienced while reading, and then forgotten about.  The book is packed with esoteric wisdom and compelling ideas and drawings.  Enjoy!
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I don't agree with the reviews that claim that the director's cut is just a longer version. It's a much better cut that makes more sense than the theatrical cut. GREAT MOVIE!
B000028U0Y|5.0|Lacks the energy of \\"At San Quentin,\\" recorded live the same year, but makes up for it by its smoky intensity. It's Johnny at the peak of his powers.
B000002MJR|2.0|Overall this isn't a 'bad' project.  Typically I think most live projects fall flat.  However Mark Knopfler holds it together and they do their standards with a small amount of flair.  However, Mark needs to learn how to speak.  His opening phrases to get the crowd going is barely intelligible.  Glad he can play the guitar though.  Don't get me wrong, I love the group.  But they have done a lot better. <br />You can't beat the studio versions of Brothers in Arms and Money for Nothing.  But, why it the world do you put a steel guitar in a pop band?  It totally ruined the live versions of some of the band's songs.  Just like when the Eagles did some funky variation of Hotel California and took out the lead guitars and threw some horns in it and I wanted to run to Taco Bell.  The Eagles are great, but c'mon, leave the standards alone.  If I go to a concert, I expect to hear power chords and riffs from lead guitars and not some hokey steel guitar and I go running for a Hank Williams LP with \\"Your Cheatin' Heart\\" on it. If you're a fan, buy the CD used, don't pay full price. <br />Instead by the studio version of Brothers in Arms.  But be careful, there is a twentieth edition \\"Brothers In Arms\\" being marketed as a DVD.  It is a DVD, but it's only a 5.1 audio version to play in your surround system.  It's not a live footage concert.
B000A7Q2DM|3.0|This album is ok.  It sounds to me like a much better version of Breaking Benjamin, with vocal stylings ala The Muse.  Although these arent exact comparisons, they are relatively accurate.  The first album blew me away!  I never heard anything like it.  It was simply epic.  I was very doubtful they could recreate that in this album; the album in general is meh.  It sounds mainstream and not very interesting.  The other reviews are dead on.  I still love 30 STM, but they really need to get back to the basics and hopefully come out with a 1st CD-esque third release.
1591396190|5.0|Blue Ocean Strategy is a fresh look at strategic planning using a market-based approach. They use the term \\"value innovation\\" which focuses on \\"utility, price, and cost positions,\\" to \\"create and capture new demand\\" and to \\"focus on the big picture, not the numbers.\\" They call this the reconstructionist view of strategy! This results in capturing new market space in blue oceans rather than trying to beat the competition in the same old red oceans. One of their favorite examples is Southwest Airlines. I was in a meeting with Colleen Barrett a week ago and hearing her I believe Kim and Mauborgne have hit the mark! <br /> <br />One of the conclusions of their study is that there are no permanently excellent industries and there are no permanently excellent companies (as presented by other current authors)! A key determinant of whether an industry or company was on a rising trajectory of strong, profitable growth was the strategic move of blue ocean creation. These moves into blue ocean were created by both industry incumbents and new entrants. The key defining feature of blue oceans was value innovative - innovation that was linked to what customers value. The result of this value innovation was not only in strong, profitable growth: this strategic move exercised a strong, positive effect on establishing a company's standing brand name in buyers' minds.  <br />
B00008DDSC|5.0|There are so many great reviews here that I don't feel it is necessary to repeat all the qualities of the film and it's stars.  Just want to say I have never seen a film like this before and found myself laughing a great deal throughout.  This cast is great and of course the subject is extremely unusual (I think) but extremely well done.  I love the way this little mouse of a girl becomes more and more confident and pretty and sexy to the point she has Spader's character on the run and having difficulty coping  with the person he's drawn into this unusual relationship.  I think you will love this film.  Or at the very least, will totally enjoy it.  Try it.
B000002IPZ|5.0|I bought Souls of Black when it was new back in 1990.  I was going through my metal period in high school (which never ended: the metal period, I mean, not high school) and I already had The Legacy and New Order by Testament which I liked but did not consider among my favorite albums.  After seeing the video for the beautiful track \\"The Legacy\\" (not to be confused with the album by the same name) which incorporated the cool cover imagery, I rushed and bought Souls of Black and it quickly became one of my favorite metal albums.  I did not (and still don't) notice anything rushed or under-produced about it.  I just hear a solid thrash metal album with tracks so catchy (ie \\"Absence of Light\\" and the title track) I can sing along to them (I can't say that about most thrash albums).  \\"Beginning of the End\\" might be considered a \\"filler\\" because it is a short instrumental but it is very cool with a Latin flavor, and it makes for a nice intro to the explosive \\"Face in the Sky.\\"  The only track I might consider semi-weak is \\"One Man's Fate\\" because I do not like the overall sound but even on this track there is aa highlight: kicking drums!     \\"Seven Days of May\\" deserves special mention.  It is about the student-led protests held Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the People's Republic of China, between April 15, 1989 and June 4, 1989. The protest denounced China's economic instability and political corruption and was violently suppressed by the PRC government.  This event was still very fresh when this album was released in 1990. On May 4, 1989, 100,000 students and workers peacefully marched in Beijing making demands for adherence to socialist principles of equality, and protesting government corruption. These demonstrations continued even after the government declared martial law on May 20. The Communist party leaders eventually sent troops and tanks to restore order. When these forces were confronted by Chinese workers in the streets of Beijing, a massacre ensued (in the words of Testament: \\"They tried to show a peaceful path then it turned into a blood bath / In the Square they plan the game That's when the tanks of the army came\\"). Even today, the Chinese government will not allow any tallies made to count the actual number of dead.  So there is lyrical meat to the album.  And by the way, the song kicks as do the others save for \\"The Legacy\\" which is a charming metal ballad about the discovery of one's mortality. Excellent all the way through, I recommend it without hesitation.
B00004XMV6|5.0|I love this film.  I have both the Rated and Unrated versions since I originally bought it on VHS and recently on DVD.  For me this was the best thing Mickey Rourke ever did and is an extremely erotic film.  Definitely, an adults only film.  This is a very intense and obsessive love/sex relationship. Unfortunately, the two parties finally get too far apart in what they deem as acceptable behavior as the approach to the relationship becomes sick.  As a result, the love affair ends abruptly.  When the relationship does end, you wish it could have continued.  It gets that kind of grip on you even though it becomes very offensive to the young woman involved.  This couple is never really  able to communicate anything to each other, other than sexually. They seem to have great fun with each other in the beginning and of course fantastic sex. Frankly, I'm not sure why I like this movie so much because it's very sad also.  I think it's well worth viewing and the price is right.
B000AADYYO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think of Opeth's new offering at first, but now that I have not removed it from my car stereo for a full month (I downloaded and burned it off some internet site, but I will still buy it today because I must support my favorite band), I can confidently say that it ranks with my other Opeth favorites Blackwater Park and My Arms Your Hearse. The CD opens with one of my alltime favorite songs from any band, Ghosts of Perdition, which sounds like it was influenced greatly by Tool's \\"Schism\\"...but Opeth is a big fan of Tool, my second favorite band, so this is a good thing im my book.  Ghosts of Perdition opens with a brutally heavy death metal section and then alternates the heavy with the usual prog sections.  Overall this album seems to find Opeth incorporating less death and more prog, which is fine with me.  Akerfeld's clean vocals have been improving with each effort, and seem to have peaked on this effort, and his death vocals are as menacing as ever.  The three mellow tracks are all awesome, better than anything off damnation in my opinion.  The only negative I would mention is regarding track 7, The Grand Conjuration.  Don't get me wrong, it is still a great tune, but it is the most repetetive Opeth song I have ever heard, and at 10 minutes I get a bit bored of it.  It is one Opeth song that I think would have been better suited to 6 or 7 minutes.  But that is a very minor complaint for the best metal album of the year, hands down.  Get it now.
B00003CXA6|4.0|The story of a great American Battle as told through the eyes of the Soldiers themselves. Based on Michael Shaara's pulitzer prize winning book \\"The Killer Angels\\". The book was superb and mostly the film stays true, although some aspects are a bit over-hollywood hokie. This is forgivable because the battle scenes are top notch and the spirit of the period and the cause is captured well.  <br /> <br />Well cast except for Martin Sheen as General Robert E. Lee...Martin Sheen?? Please. Lee was such a great figure. Tom Berringer is terrific as General James Longstreet. The beard is a bit overdone, but he captures the essence of the brooding Confederate who was Lee's \\"Right Hand\\"  <br /> <br />A must for any Civil War buff.
B00081MUY0|5.0|\\"Sunshine Superman\\" was Donovan's first \\"Electric\\" album, first released in late 1966. Although producer's Micky Most has been givin much credit for creating Donovan's \\"new progressive\\" sound, there had actually been signs on his previous album \\"Fairytale\\", that he would be exploring new styles and sounds on forthcoming records. The great song and slightly jazzy \\"Sunny Goodge Street\\" would have fitted nicely into the concept of both \\"Sunshine Superman\\" and the follow-up album \\"Mellow Yellow\\"<br /><br />When the album was released \\"Sunshine Superman\\" had already been a huge hit on the singles charts on both sides of the Atlantic; with its great bass intro hook.<br /><br />On many tracks though, Donovan's folk background still shines through.

B000AADYYO|5.0|Imagine if you will Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, James Taylor and Morbid Angel meeting in a room and drinking a few absinthe cocktails.  After everyone is inebriated, they decide to compose music incorporating each others unique musical sensabilities.  If those artists hooked up they might as well have named their new musical adventure Opeth, because that is exactly what the Swedish supergroup Opeth have done.  I don't think there is a finer band in the world of heavy metal at this moment.  If Opeth continues to evolve, explore and improve, who knows, they might wind up being recognized as the greatest band this genre of music has ever seen.   <br />Listening to their latest effort actually sent chills down my spine.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing; the musicianship and songwriting is astonishing. This is progressive rock at it's very best.  If you aren't familiar with Opeth don't let the reviewers who mention Opeth being a death metal band scare you away, because they are not a death metal band.  Let me reiterate, they are a progressive rock band and this is prog-rock at it's best.  I recommend anyone thinking about spending their hard earned money on this Opeth CD to do so; I promise you won't be disappointed.  You never know, they might become your favorite band.
B0002858YS|5.0|Every Song is Excellent. There's not much else to say! I wasn't a fan of the early 80s sound, but this re-invention is worthy of repeated listenings. Throw it on the cd player and leave it there!
0790729628|2.0|I saw this version in a theater and I have to say I felt ripped off. The missing naration doesn't add or detract from the movie, in fact, I kinda missed it.  The \\"unicorn dream\\" sequence is footage Ridley Scott stole from his 1983 disaster \\"Legend\\", the movie he dumped \\"Dune\\" to make. The only other major difference is the lack of a happy ending. The real story here is that this is not the definitve version of the film. There is another... a friend of mine saw a sneak preview back in the day in which Deckard was a replicant (remember all those old family photos on the piano?).  Maybe one day that version will see the light of day and we will have a real \\"Director's Cut\\".  Until then I say stick to the original.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Wow, Opeth has really done it this time. \\"Ghost Reveries\\" has to be in the top 5 albums I've heard all year. While Deliverance was a bit disappointing, and Damnation was largely a giant experiment, Ghost Reveries finds Opeth once again experimenting and evolving. If you're familiar with Opeth, you know what their about-epic songwriting, amazing death metal growls, acoustic passages, fantastic clean vocals, and pretty much everything else you'd want in a progressive death metal band. Now they've added synth and keyboards into their sound on a full time basis and what may be an album that long time Opeth fans will not like at first, the band may have written their finest album.  <br /> <br />The riffing is much more complex, the solos are inspiring, and the songs even with all their abrasiveness are just downright fun and easy to get into...something I thought I would never say about Opeth. That's not to say that with repeated listens that more and more brilliance behind the writing unfolds, because it does. Listening to this album invoked a lot of the same feelings I had when I first listened to Tool's \\"Lateralus\\" and there's even a few parts that feel a little Tool-esque on the \\"Ghost Of Perdition.\\" \\"The Grand Conjuration\\" dabbles into some Meshuggah-esque style riffing and complexities. \\"The Baying Of The Hounds\\" really brings forth the bands newly found experimentation with synths and keyboards. \\"Beneath The Mire\\" contains an almost middle eastern feel to it as does \\"Atonement\\" but not quite in the same that I make it sound, not like Nile for example. Remember when George Harrison of the Beatles experimented with middle eastern influences? Yes, much more like that. Reverie/Harlequin Forest serves as the albums epic, clocking in at 11:39 while theres a few 10 and a half minute tracks. Mikael Akerfeldt's clean vocals sound ridiculously amazing on this album, as displayed on \\"Hours Of Wealth\\" and the album's closer \\"Isolation Years.\\" <br /> <br />For those worried that Roadrunner may have messed with this bands sound, trust me, it has NOT happened. Not only is this the best record Roadrunner has put all year long over all of their metalcore releases and 25th anniversery addition releases, but this could easily be Opeth's finest album. If Opeth isn't the Pink Floyd of Death Metal, I have no idea who has. A top 5 album of the year easily, and worthy of a purchase from anyone who enjoys real music.
B0009OUBNI|3.0|This is essentially nothing more than a repackaging of the 1998 \\"Greatest\\" CD and DVD (previously sold separately) into a single package.  If you don't have it yet and you really want it, this collection is a good way to get the full package.  One note however, the version of this I have seen out in the stores doesn't have the full list of videos on the DVD that the separate package had, so beware.  Make sure you are in fact buying what you want and don't get your panties in a bunch if the particular video you wanted isn't on there!
B00070Q8DQ|1.0|I accidentally downloaded a song off this bands first album, Satanica.  The song was \\"Ceremony of Shiva\\".  Are you kidding me? This is not music.  This is pure hatred.  I went on to see if they really were as awful as they initially sounded by listening to several songs and reading thier lyrics along with them.  I don't know why such hate is harvested in people who listen to this garbage, but i feel as though it's just a way of people wanting to be passionate about something.  Try listening to the other end of the spectrum.  It may surprise you.  This end did nothing for me.

B000002JSP|4.0|They didn't know it at the time but In through The Out Door was Led Zeppelin's final studio albulm and was in many ways thier most fascinating. Bassist John Paul Jones was clearly in control, recieving songwriting credits on six of the seven songs, and has shed the monster riffs and bone-crushing power chords in favor of eclectic forays into samba, country, synthesizer arrangements and R&B flavored soul. Zeppelin albulms had always contained a potpourri of musical flavors but they had never before been as unabashed in embracing them. Under siege from punk rock, disco, and critics who decried them as dinosaurs, they were looking to break new ground, and with the exception of the hard-rock stomp of \\"In The Evening\\" the songs are a radical departure from their previous work. The piano-driven \\"South Bound Saurez\\" and the country boogie of \\"Hot Dog\\" are pure goofy fun. \\"Fool In The Rain\\" with it's Latin percussion, Robert Plant's warm, soaring vocals, and Jimmy Page's scorching fuzz-box guitar solo is one of thier greatest songs. \\"Carouselambra\\" is an attempt at a ten minute long 'epic' but Jones multi-layered keyboard workouts render Plant's vocals unintelligble. \\"All My Love\\" a sweet, aching ballad Plant wrote about his late son, Karac, is Zeppelin at thier most emotionally moving. The albulm ends with \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" a predictable slow blues number features a raw, soulful solo from Page. While it's rich in texture, In Through The Out Door is not one of Led Zeppelins major works. With only seven songs clocking in at around thirty minutes it feels more like an EP than a full-length release.  After John Bonham's death and the bands subsequent break-up the albulm does hint at what direction they mave taken.
B00003CXWV|4.0|If you're looking for a moral from Blow, it's \\"dealing hard drugs never ends well.\\" Not exactly the Dalai Lama at his finest. <br /> <br />But if you're looking for an interesting story, movie and DVD, you might find this quite satisfying. <br />The story is pretty simple. George Jung, deciding he didn't want to rerun the woes of his father, whom he loves, leaves home and winds up in the drug dealing business. He graduates from marijuana to cocaine and becomes a major league cocaine dealer, a move that dictates the course of his later life. <br />Johnny Depp as George, Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths as his parents are excellent. Penelope Cruz's character is annoying, but what's worse is so is Penelope. By the end, she truly reminded me of a chihuahua.   <br /> <br />Demme gave the scenes in each period of this tale, which goes from the 1950s through the 1990s, the texture identified with that time period. For example, in the late 1960s California scenes, you feel like you're watching the outtakes from Pepsi ads from the era. <br /> <br />The DVD extras, besides the commentaries, include interviews with the real George Jung; a documentary on the Colombian drug trade; and the infnifilm feature, which lets you click onto deleted scenes when the spots they would've been in come up in the movie, but click on \\"interviews\\" with the characters (pretty fun). <br /> <br />I give it two and a half stars for the flick and a one-star bump for the DVD quality.
B000002G1Y|4.0|I must admit I felt let down when I first bought this cd, expecting to be blown away after \\"Stolen Moments\\" but with lines like that it's hard to stay disappointed for long.  Yes, there are several throw-aways included here but 5 songs make this one better than average by a long shot.  The title cut, \\"Buffalo River Home,\\" \\"Blue Telescope,\\" \\"Permanent Hurt,\\" and \\"Loving a Hurricane\\" are easily worth the cost.  Of all those \\"Buffalo River Home\\" deserves to be considered one of his all-time best.
0140067477|5.0|Everyone I know loved pooh as a kid. He was ever-happy, ever-satisfied, and ever-peaceful. With the exception of the occasional honey-related fiasco, he seemed to know a thing or two about living. However, as we get older, watching and reading about Pooh and his friends becomes frustrating. Why is your life so simple, Pooh? This world we live in is so hectic, and if we don't periodically step back and breathe, we begin to think that this is how life is supposed to be. When people tell me to relax, or not worry, or spout off clichs like \\"whatever happens will happen\\", I can tend to get really mad. How dare you say that?!? Do you know everything I have to get done today? What I usually don't realize, and what they may not realize, is that they are really preaching some of the ancient and wise tenets of Taoism. What I'm really looking for, I suppose, is the formula for a good life. Like most people, I spend a lot of my time trying to find it in work, possessions, getting into college, what have you... But as Pooh teaches through The Tao of Pooh, happiness and contentment lie right in front of me.   <br /> <br />The Tao of Pooh approaches the wisdom and (sometimes) backwards philosophy involved in Taoism using understandable scenarios involving Pooh and his pals in the hundred acre wood. For example, Pooh and his friends wander around the forest looking for his home but keep arriving at the same sinkhole, and not his house. He then decides that if they look for the sinkhole, they will surely arrive at his house. This story was meant to show the futility of seeking something out, because what is meant to come to you will.  <br /> <br />Each character in The Tao of Pooh represents a frame of mind addressed in Taoism. Eeyore is supposed to characterize giving up, and giving in to suffering and misfortune. From what I've read about the book, this is a poke at Buddhism's \\"life is suffering.\\" The rabbit and the owl represent the over-intellectuals. Owl seeks out knowledge for the sake of knowledge, of being able to look wise. While they seek to analyze and comprehend everything they do and see, they show the supposed flaws of the rigid analysis and thought process preached in Confucianism. I think the point of their characters is that we're not supposed to understand everything, so we shouldn't try. Although wise, his wisdom extends only to his mind and not to his heart where it counts. In contrast to these characters, Pooh has a rich heart and a life of happiness, because he takes the good with the bad, doesn't struggle to grasp every confusing aspect of life, and knows that above all \\"life is good\\".  <br /> <br />There is nothing in this book that we've never heard before. However, they're all things that, as people tied to a clock and a palm pilot, we quickly brush off if they're not well stated. The thing that makes this book rather incredible is the way it drives the ideas home using a character we are all comfortable with. The anecdotes in this book are captivating and very effective at showing us the things that make life worth living. This world would be a much better place to live in if everyone followed Pooh's lead - just slowed down and realized how great life truly is.
0767836324|5.0|The first time I watched this movie I wasn't too impressed. Looking back I'd have to say this negative first impression was totally my fault and not the films. I guess it just didn't fit my preconceived notion of what Neverland should be like and simply didn't give the movie a chance to pull me into its wonderfully imaginary landscape of people and places. Fortunately my daughter loved it and forced me to watch it with her over and over and over again. Once I learned to let myself go and become a child (which is what this film is about in the first place), I fell in love with it!<br /><br />While some Amazon reviewers have questioned the choice of Robin Williams for the lead role of Peter Panning, I found him to be absolutely perfect in the part of the middle-aged workalcoholic who had forgotten all about his childhood adventures as the legendary Peter Pan. Then of course you have stellar performances by the rest of the all-star cast:  Dustin Hoffman (Captain Hook), Bob Hoskins (Smead), Julia Roberts (Tinkerbell) and Maggie Smith (Granny Wendy). Lesser known, but three of my personal favorites in the movie were:  Caroline Goodall (Moira Panning), Dante Basco (Rufio) and Amber Scott (Maggie Panning).<br /><br />Become A Child Again! It Will Be An Awfully Big Adventure!
0399230033|5.0|I received this book as a baby shower gift. I didn't open for almost 18 months. I had tried to read several stories to my son and he didn't seem interest. I picked up this book one day and that was it. My son is hooked on books. This is a great book that let's you be creative with the story. It engages your child. I get quite animated when reading it and so does he. If someone else reads this book to him, he will make the sounds that him and I make when we read it. I adore this sweet story.
0393317552|3.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel is an academic exercise in junkyard salvage.  Any mechanic will tell you that a car that doesn't run isn't necessarily trash.  It can still be useful for the parts that the car is made of.  This book is worth reading, not because its thesis is in working order - it's not - but because there is a wealth of interesting information in the parts that make up the thesis.  If a reader can overlook the overly simplified environmental determinism, they can mine out fascinating nuggets of information ranging from crop domestication, to linguistic studies to human migration. <br /> <br />From an argumentative perspective, the author establishes a non-falsifiable case.  It is a pseudo-scientific masquerade where causation is conflated with correlation and where the entire cannon of diverse human history can be plucked through to find supportive theories and examples.  The author upholds collaborating evidence because it collaborates, and discounts everything else because it does not.  For example, he meticulously describes the evolutionary process by which corn was domesticated and changed from pinky-sized ears to the forearm-sized corn cobs that we enjoy today, but ignores and rejects the implications of human evolution caused by different selective advantages for a farmer and a hunter-gatherer over the same span of time.  The thesis and the support are self-fulfilling, and argumentatively fallacious. <br /> <br />In the final chapter, the author reveals his intention to bring scientific methodology to human history.  The scientific positivism he proposes - which has long been rejected for social sciences because it fails to predict human behavior - strives to tell a tale of human development that unfolded a certain specific way and could not have unfolded in any other way. <br /> <br />In the book's thesis-framing example, Pizarro leads 168 Spaniards to victory over 80,000 Incan soldiers.  The author argues that the result was environmentally pre-determined and accordingly that there was no way it could have occurred differently.  This is just one example by which he explicitly attempts to remove human agency from the equation of human history, with the penultimate goal of discrediting any claim that human differences account for differences in human history. <br /> <br />The author's intentions are clear, as he is very careful to jump through politically correct hoops with disclaimer after disclaimer to appease his hypersensitive academic audience.  Over and over again he assures the reader that he is not racist (which he proves by explaining how he thinks native New Guineans are more intelligent than American Whites, a politically correct - albeit racist - contention). <br /> <br />The central problem with his thesis becomes evident in his final chapters when he tries - and fails - to reconcile the explanations of human pre-history with recorded accounts of modern-recorded history.  The problem of human agency overwhelms an otherwise untested hypothesis.  When writing about events for which there is no record beyond the ultimate terminal result it is easy to discount the impact of human decisions because there is no record of those decisions being made.  Since the choice between A and B is not explicit, one can assume that there wasn't a choice at all using the perfection of hind-sight.  Surely the Allied Forces had to land at Normandy (instead Pas de Calais or Italy) to win World War 2 because they won the war after landing at Normandy.  This is the circular logic that permeates primary thesis: It had to happen because it did happen. <br /> <br />But in the final chapters, he attempts to bring his theory of human development into the 20th Century and cracks begin to emerge.  The success of Chinese Civilization which was predicted by environmental determinism choked and failed because of human choices (the choice of Eunuchs to shut down ports).  The failure of Japan to adopt muskets resulted from the human codeof the Samurai and the honor of the sword.  Once human history - and the inevitable choices incurred by human agency - are recorded, there is more difficulty discounting the impact of those decisions. <br /> <br />Ultimately, then, this book is not able to discount the impact of human agency or redirect the focus from human difference. <br /> <br />Although the thesis is not compelling - largely because it overreaches - there is certainly use in the individual arguments that are made.  Certainly, environmental conditions played some role in human history.  The important caveat that needs to be made is that environmental variables helped shape but did not dictate the paths that human history took.  Different people in the same environments would have lead to different results.  The author all but admits this when he talks about the near-death of Hitler before World War 2, and the failed assassination attempt later. <br /> <br />The sections on human migration, plant and animal domestication, and written language development are fascinating.  The utility of this book is that it surveys such a broad range of topics, explaining extremely complex theories succinctly and in plain English.  You don't have to be an anthropologist or a botanist to grasp the narrative prose.  The author litters the pages with anecdotal evidence that, like the parts of a broken down car, can be taken out and reassembled into a car that runs. <br /> <br />This reservoir of interesting, useful information makes this book worth the time to read, so long as one is sufficiently critical of the thesis.  And just in case you are on the border, the book has pictures too.
B000002B5L|3.0|This was a good fugees album. I expected more of this since it's been praised as a classic...However it's NOT a classic but a good album..nothing groundbreaking though.
B00005JLT5|4.0|It's hard to understand how human beings can be so cruel. Indiscriminately murdering, beating those who are helpless, and tearing families apart are scenes in this movie that are impossible to forget. Roman Polanski doesn't shy away from the reality of what went on. And, of course, it was undoubtedly much worse than what we see in this movie (which is bad enough). <br /> <br />This is an excellent movie. Even though it is long, the storyline moves along well and keeps you interested. As I watched it I couldn't help but think, \\"How could this happen?\\" But it did and the violence such as you see here continues to go on in various places around the world -- just not to this extent.
B000002UB3|2.0|This is the beatles most overrated album. I never understood why it's often praised so often. I mean sone songs on Side 1 are meaningless and silly. The second side definitly saved this album from total catostrophy..I dont recommend this album...listen to it before you buy and judge yourself.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Having no expectations I was pleasantly surprised by the power of this little film about nerds in search of a dream. <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is the high school nerd who gets pushed around and taunted by the cool kids. He befriends a new kid Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and together they form a union that takes them into the political arena, running for school president against the most popular girl, Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff). But Napoleon must also deal with his missing Grandmother (Sandy Martin), his nerdier brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and his haphazardly enterprising Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). With a subdued laugh a minute Napoleon's life is revealed with a bang. <br /> <br />This little film may seem rather dull at first but once the Quaalude induced dark humor of the title character makes his point you will beg for more. Jon Heder is absolutely convincing as the buck toothed, pale and athletically inept Dynamite, just looking at him doing nothing will begin the giggles! Along with Aaron Ruell and Jon Gries you can't ask for a better comedic team to marvel at. Gries gets the gist of the cool nerd down, spending most of his time trying to be attractive but falling far short while Ruell is at an even tie with Heder for who plays the perfect outcast. Under all the humor of course lies the dark life of someone who doesn't \\"fit-in\\" and in a casual way the filmmakers divulge this side of life without making it so harsh as to make a definite statement, although the point is made within the blast that is Napoleon. Make sure to stay until the credits are run for a short hint about the outcome of all the character's lives. This movie is simply a blast! <br />
B00006690G|2.0|This has to be one of the worst albums I ever heard. I beleive Eminem to be very overrated. His lyrics are violent, offensive and childish..Anyone who places Eminem above all-time greats like Rakim, KRS, Nas and 2pac Should have their head checked.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This CD is a refreshing change from some of the music that is out there. The band has a sound similar to U2. The first few times I listened I wasn't sure if I loved it or not, but the album grows on you. I'm not going to analyze every song here, if you like Coldplay you will like this album.
B000002UDB|1.0|Definitly one of their worst albums along with Rubber Soul and the overrated REVOLVER album. Skip it good.
020530902X|5.0|I first encountered Strunk and White's 'Elements of Style' when I was an undergraduate, and I have been a fan of this book ever sense.  Perhaps it is because of the excellent teamwork that is apparent on the pages between the master of language, William Strunk, and the master of narrative, E.B. White.  How can you go wrong learning grammar from the likes of the author of such wonderful tales as Stuart Little?<br /><br />During my English composition class as an undergraduate, we had to read this book twice, once at the beginning of the term, and again at the end.  I have since referred to the pages so often that I am on my fourth or fifth copy, as the binding and pages have worn out from use.  Long before books such as 'Woe is I' or 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves', this book, 'The Elements of Style' has held a certain pride of place in being useful, accessible and interesting in its presentation of a traditionally and typically boring subject - grammar and usage.<br /><br />Among the pieces I re-read on a frequent basis is the list of commonly misused or abused words and phrases.  Here is a list of easily corrected mistakes that the typical writer and speaker needs to keep in mind.  Also, the suggestions for composition are gentle reminders that creativity and good craftsmanship need not be contradictory.<br /><br />This is a wonderful gift and wonderful treat for oneself.
B000002WPI|1.0|This is not a classic. \\"Cream\\" is the only good song I found here..the rest of the album is filled with skits...Dont buy this.
B00004VVNB|5.0|This movie ought to be studied over and over again by the people who write and make science fiction films.<br /><br />It is the preeminent example in the genre of how you can have the most awful look, the most inept direction, and the cheesiest, most laughable special effects . . .<br /><br />. . . and yet the film will be universally known and still talked about decades later because of what a solid, solid story it was.<br /><br />About a million times more potent that some dumb monster eating people in outer space!
B0000025RI|3.0|This is an ok album..Nothing more..nothing less. Those geniuses claiming that this is the best album ever recorded should go out there and search for more music.
B00006FDCJ|4.0|The swooning and gushing with which this film was greeted and beOscared just goes to show how low our standards of storytelling have gotten.<br /><br />Now, it's definitely worth watching -- chiefly because of the script, which is unusually insightful for that of a Western.  It's definitely a good film that takes you, with a sure hand, into unexpected places.<br /><br />But a great film?  In the pantheon of immortal Westerns, like \\"Shane\\" and \\"The Searchers\\"?  You gotta be kidding!<br /><br />The climax scene in the saloon, I admit, is sheer cinematic perfection.  The rest of the movie, though, is uneven, particularly the casting of Morgan Freeman.  This has to the most off-base casting of his career:  at no point was I convinced that he was an evil (and horny) assassin.
B0000039PW|5.0|Yes this is one of the best east cost rap albums....Every song is great...Too bad Biggie went on to make commercial garbage on Life After Death and Abandoned his roots.
B00006FM77|5.0|I was a huge Chicago fan back when this album came out.  I was a teenage trumpet player and Chicago was by far my favorite band.  I was disappointed when Carnegie Hall came out.  I think it was the extended solos that I wasn't ready for, but I can also remembering not liking the quality of the recording.  Now I am a 45 year old man that has seen Chicago many times in concert.  I enjoy the shows, but realize that Chicago will never be what they were.  Now I just bought this new release of the Carnegie Hall set.  WOW!!!  I never realized how much this band was smokin' during these recordings.  They were just awesome during that week.  The only problem now is that I can never go see Chicago again.  If you have forgotten just how good the band was in the old days, you need to listen to this set.  But be warned, you may never want to listen to their later stuff when you hear how they have paled ever since.
B00000JJQK|1.0|I never understood what's the BIG deal behind this album. Yes, the production is wonderfull but the songwriting is childish and rubbish. Brial Wilson definitly can not write great lyrics like Bob Dylan sometimes do. \\"God Only Know\\" and \\"Wouldnt Be nice\\" are indeed masterpieces...but the rest of the album is background music..
0156027321|4.0|This novel is truly a novel, which makes you think.  I enjoyed reading the whole novel, but the part that enticed me to keep thinking and reading was the first third of the novel.  The first part of the novel is my favorite because it revolves around the philosophical aspect of Piscine Molitor Patel's life.  It truly portrays his intelligence, reason, and life.  He portrayes what is most important to him.  What I really got out of the book was that life is your own canvas and it can be very blank, sad, unadventerous, happy and even exciting, but it all falls back on you to determine which one of those it will be. <br />The book was very unique, comparisons can be made, but it is it's own piece of art work.  Very funny too!!!
0141804467|4.0|Buyers be advised that, though this page as of 08/30/2005 does not specify, this is ABRIDGED.  So for those of you that cannot stand the thought of missing out on something that should have been left in (like me), just keep browsing for a different edition.  I found out the hard way.
6305291446|5.0|I loved Halloween H2O. The whole movie is scary from beginning to end and Michael looks spooky as ever with his haunting white mask. It is now 20 years later after Laurie Strode confronted Michael for the first time since back in 1978. I was so glad that Jamie Lee Curtis character came back to confront Michael again. She does a brilliant job at playing the powerful yet paranoid \\"Laurie\\".    The movie beginns with Nurse Marion Chambers who I thought was great to bring back into the Halloween movie franchise. She is an important character and I wish the directors would have given her more character development in the movie. Nurse Marion is from Halloween 1 and shows up near the of Halloween 2. She has been nursing Dr. Sam Loomis. It is now October 30th, 1998.  She comes home and notices that someone has broken into her home and has gone through some important files.  She lets 2 teens check her house out and we soon learn that Michael back. The opening credits show the movie title then 20 years later.  The Halloween music is back and you hear thunder in the background as the movie starts. You also  hear Dr. Sam Loomis's voice and he talks about Michael from 1978 during the credits.  Dr. Loomis's  room if full of newspaper archives from 1978 and 1980 regarding Laurie and the bloodbath that happened that Halloween night.  I thought this was a clever way to introduce the movie as we are all wondering where Laurie is.      Laurie is now grown up teaches at a secluded prestigious private school in Northern California and has changed her name to Keri Tate. She also has a 17 year old son John Tate played by Josh Harnett whom she has some problems with. \\"Laurie\\"  still trying to move on from the past sees Michael in her imagination and dreams. She uses alcohol to try to numb the pain she indured 20 years ago. She also tries to confide in her boyfriend played by Adam Arkin but still has a difficult time talking about it.  Michael eventually finds \\" Laurie\\". What makes the moviemore scarey is that Laurie and a few others are left all alone after all the kids from the school go to the Yosemite National Park for a weekend trip.  Everything is dark and quite now. Michael conventiantly gets past the security guard played by L.L. Cool Jay. The death scenes for the most part beginn here and they are all pretty intense as Michael goes from one victim to another. \\"Laurie\\"  is finally forced to confront Michael but in order for her to face her fears she finally decides to turn the table on Michael and goes after him. She will do anything to save her son and his girlfrind Molly played by Michelle Williams.  She also knows that Michael can not be easily killed. The ending is mind blowing  and it will leave you with many questions. There are also 2 scenes in this movie which mimic Halloween 1 and there is a cameo by the late Janet Leah.  I really enjoyed this film it was highly entertaining to watch. The DVD also includes extras with interviews with Jamie Lee Curtis, Josh Harnett, a quiz on how well you know the Halloween films and a rock video made for the movie. There is also an interesting interview with Moustapha Akkad where he talks about the Halloween film franchise and why Donald Pleasance wanted to do so more of them.
B00005JN5X|1.0|This has got to be the lamest movie I have seen in a very long time. In a more than dismal attempt to tell a story the producer slaps the audience with a series of incoherent scenes and mediocre acting. I cannot believe this movie was released to the public. I have seen much more elaborate works from directing students. I even doubt that kids will enjoy this heresy. Adults: you'll probably get more enjoyment out driving through a long tunnel than watching this.
0553275976|4.0|Beginning this novel, I knew its reputation and its basic plot, but right off I feared I would despise this novel because of the horrible things that Sherman McCoy puts his wife Judy and daughter Campbell through. <br /> <br />This novel is really about characters, primarly McCoy and to a lesser degree Larry Kramer, the DA.  Yet Wolfe also devotes large chunks to Peter Fallow, the tabloid drunk journalist, and Reverand Bacon, the scheming civil rights leader. <br /> <br />As the novel opens, McCoy is a selfish louse who views himself as a Master of the Universe in his position as a bond salesman.  He also is cheating on his wife and lusts after other moms at his daughter's bus stop.  McCoy is a bad man.  But circumstances take over and other people, acting realistically, (like Kramer the DA and Fallow the journalist) and in their own self-interests begin to do things that on the surface are right, but end up attacking McCoy's sheltered life. <br /> <br />As the novel progresses, McCoy became a more sympathetic man.  One reviewer said they felt cheated because McCoy never changed until the final 2 pages and it would have been much better if he had changed some during the course of the novel.  But I think McCoy began to change the moment he spent a few hours in jail.  At that time, he needed Judy to be with him and tried to reach out to her, but his behavior previously had kept her from being supportive of him.  Campbell was also affected by McCoy but not permanently. <br /> <br />In this character driven novel, there aren't good guys or bad guys, just normal people acting selfishly and predictably and these situations ultimately force Sherman Mccoy to realize what is important in life before it is too late.
0671646788|4.0|Excellent read loaded with useful, practical information. Laid out in a clear concise fashion, this book really gets to the essence of what it takes to achieve your dreams. Perhaps, one of the best I've ever seen in the self-help arena.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What's Good:<br />- If you like sci-fi, you should love this.  My wife is not a sci-fi fan and while she probably won't admit to liking it, everytime I watch it and she happens to be watching too, she seems engrossed in the story, asks questions and I catch her laughing at times as well.<br />- The characters are very interesting, each of them are believable and each have their own secrets waiting to be known.  You learn more with each episode.<br />- It's story best if watched in order.  There is an overall story being told as well as a seperate story for each episode.  You are left with a feeling of accomplishment, that something happened and something was resolved with each episode while the larger story continues.<br />- A space adventure mixed with old western flair... not sure how they did it, but they did and it works very well.<br />- No sound in space.  Yes, I deem this a good thing.  There is no sound in space.  A ship flying by doesn't whine, you can't hear rockets from space because sound can't travel in space.  This is the first show that I have ever seen on TV (2001: A Space Odyssey I believe also didn't play sounds which gave it that creepy eerie feeling) where you don't hear any sounds.  Instead they play background music gives it a real sense of openess, endlessness... space.<br />- I'm actually looking foward to watching the DVD from start to finish again when it arrives and I'll probably put together a \\"shindig\\" of my own at my work to show other people this great series.<br /><br />What's not so good:<br />First and foremost, the series was cancelled before it was fully aired by Fox.  The story is incomplete.  Hopefully, the movie will fix that but I'm interested in knowing how they're going to pull off the movie with all the background information we already know from the series and draw in people that never watched the series.<br />Last but not least, the series was cancelled before it was fully aired by Fox.<br /><br />More information if you care to read further:<br />Will you believe that I never heard of this show before about 1 month ago (July '05) when I saw an add for the pilot on the SciFi channel?  It's not too surprising, as I have 3 young children and really didn't watch much TV.  But thanks to DVR I've been opened up to a new world of TV shows that I love, such as Lost, 24, Stargate SG1, Stargate Atlantis and the new Battlestar Galactica.<br /><br />The last few mentioned are aired on the Sci-Fi channel which is how I noticed a commercial for the pilot of Firefly.  At first I didn't know it was a 3 year old show and it looked interesting.  I tried watching some of the other shows on the sci-fi channel but I guess I'm just not a true enough fanatatic as most of the other \\"original\\" shows are just plain painful for me to watch... bad acting, bad plot, bad everything...  So I didn't have high hopes for Firefly at first.  But then I learned it was going to be a series so that probably means it must be decent or they wouldn't be able to get past the first show.  So I gave it a try.<br /><br />Serenity Part 1 - I thought it was decent.  I wasn't in love with it and wasn't sure I was going to add it to my DVR recordings but I'd give Serenity Part 2 a shot.<br />Serenity Part 2 - Holy Smokes that was good.  I figured out that part 1 was just kind of like an introduction to the characters... it really is 1 show split into 2 on the sci-fi channel.  The 2nd part blew me away.  But could it sustain that?<br /><br />I watched the next episode called \\"Train Job\\" and I was hooked for good.  But a sad thing happened.  My DVR for some reason didn't record the show called Bushwacked and I missed it.  I was very upset.  But then I found out that it was being re-aired from Fox from a few years ago... could it be available on DVD to rent?  YES!  I was a happy man.  Not to mention the picture was much better on my plasma screen.  Now, I've watched all but the final DVD which I'll remedy immediately.<br /><br />I'mso impressed with this show, that this was the very first TV series on DVD that I have ever purchased and the first thing on Amazon that I have ever reviewed.  It's probably one of the only shows (including all of those I mentioned above) that I would be willing to watch over and over again.<br /><br />And now I find out they're making a movie!  I thought I was happy before, this is just down-right amazing.  But did I heard sounds (not just music) in the space scenes in the movie trailer?<br /><br />I have no idea how this series was ever cancelled after just 1 year (or was it less than 1 year) of shows.  It just doesn't make sense.  Fox must have really screwed something up to allow that to happen.ever purchased and the first thing on Amazon that I have ever reviewed.

0553278223|2.0|The first time I read this book I was in high school and in the latter half of a research program on chemical perception enhancement. At the time I thought this was a great book. Based on those memories, I bought the NBC Television Mini-series on VHS in my second year of university. Then, I attributed the suckage level of that production to the typical mid-seventies literary &quot;interpretation&quot;. However, a recent re-read of the book has led me to reevaluate my assessment of this opus of Bradbury's. Now, Bradbury is famous for such classics as &quot;Farenheight 451&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. The Martian Chronicles though, lacks any of the sophisticated storytelling one might expect from a master with Bradbury's credentials. One of the annoying things was the ridiculously unrealistic schedule at which major events occurred. On top of that, in one chronicle, when faced with an unbelievable scene at their arrival on Mars, the astronauts of an expedition perform some pathetically naïve mental gymnastics in order to rationalise what they are experiencing.<br />Later chronicles don't improve much. Granted, Bradbury was trying to make a statement regarding the human tendency for violence not only toward each other but also toward our home planet. Unfortunately, he goes about it in such a ham-handed way that the characters come off as clownish morons and you end up spending more time wondering how these idiots ever made it to Mars without blowing themselves up. Of course, you are less than surprised when they do. Humans blow themselves up through their arrogance and disrespect for the environment and Native peoples. For that message, I can think of better presentations.
B000A7Q2DM|4.0|While I was an avid fan of their debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars' self titled album was a little too spacey and drawn out in sections. The lyrics while artfully done were over the top with the topics of space and the universe that drives us. Well Jared Leto sheds his skin and bares it all to have this band to succeed. In doing so, he writes a more collective and more song oriented album.<br /><br />As I mentioned the music and the lyrics are very appropriately done. Each song is tight and never falters or drags on for too long to garner some sort of mood. Leto's lyrics sway away from our universe and space, and instead it centers around situations we as humans go through everyday. The CD isn't overly depressed either but more like a rollercoaster with The Kill being the rush and tracks like The Story being the somber mellow tracks. When I heard Attack on the radio, I knew that they had taken a step in the right direction. This is the song that radio has been waiting to have! The title track sets up a mood while still being a solid song that is very reminscent of The Cure. My personal favorite is the adrenaline charged The Kill. It fires on all cylinders. Instrumentally, the band is more raw and less manufactured the way the debut seemed to be. Sometimes the music brings to mind bands like A Perfect Circle, The Cure, or even at times Depeche Mode. I use the comparisons only to give you an overall picture of the sound, but this album by no means lacks identity.<br /><br />I could go song by song on this effort but I think that would almost ruin it for you. What I want to get across in this review is that 30 Seconds to Mars appear to know exactly what they want to do and in the process deliver an amazing album. By the way, this album is unable to be copied and burned, so just do the band a favor and buy the album. This along with Dredg's Catchwithoutarms and Coldplay's X & Y.
