B00BF123WG|3.0|This movie is surprisingly boring given how amazing the underlying subject is.  I also didn't like that they didn't portray at all White House involvement in the mission.  I did like the leading actress.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Must... play... now...!! This game is so addictive... u cant stop playing. I wasted my battery on this game. GET THIS APP PEOPLES! !!!!!! Me + This app =&hearts;
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|This is the best epic movie ever made, and the main plot and many subplots merge in spectacular, tender fashion, casting off the small case truth of historical accuracy for the far more important TRUTH of a well-told story.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app!! It does get boring after an hour you've been playin it. Still I recommend this app to all Phineas and Ferb lovers. (ME!!!)  Get this app!!! :-) ;-) :-D
B003JTHXOK|4.0|As usual, Sparks keeps you in &#34;love&#34; with his characters. Found this book to be one of his best. Really enjoyed it.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Across the u is now my favorite movie, the singing and their interpretation of the Beatles' songs is bliss. This movie takes you on a journey. I mean, you are watching the end and go back and think of everything from the beginning and you think whew! I love that about this film. The acting is so-so but honestly you don't think about it while you watch it. There are a lot of main characters but they did an amazing job at making sure everyone had their screen time and you were able to follow effortlessly. As a huge Beatles fan, I appreciated the way they used the songs, they kept true to the originals. The artwork and imagery brings you to another world completely which makes it an irresistible film to watch! Love!
B0092S4WLY|1.0|Sorry but there's something wrong with a \\"game\\" that comes with no instructions other than \\"solve the puzzles!\\" and then can't even show you what puzzle there is to solve, unless simply figuring out how to make the game progress is the puzzle. How about a freakin' clue? Glad I didn't pay money for this.
B0001I562I|5.0|Item arrived just as it was described.  Brand new and in perfect condition.  I paid a very good price for this movie.
B007P06DJK|5.0|Saw the film on ,public television. It is absolutely riveting! the whole history of S Africa, very well done. I have ordered 2 so far, great gifts to Graceland fans! Film plus album...how can you go wrong!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Justin Timberlake adds a dose of well needed lightheartedness into a troubled relationship between a father and daughter team sent to scout out the best new player in Major League Baseball.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun and challenging. My husband and I are addicted to this game. Would recommend to anyone who . Likes Tetris, solitaire or mahjong titans.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Such a sweet movie with dry humor directed towards likely events that could happen within a selected community.  I can honestly see a lawyer becoming upset and deciding to throw his shoe at an 8th grade math teacher/scout leader, who is only trying to make sense of the whole situation.
B000H7PB4G|5.0|In fact, we are on our second Peugeot Zephir pepper grinder. We wore the first one out we used it so much! Even with our daily use, it lasted over 2 years. If Peugeot were to up the ante and not use a plastic insert to stabilize the grinding shaft, who knows how long it will last? We use it at the table and for cooking. I've seen other reviews saying that it is too slow, etc., but any slowness is due to the gear reduction for torque so that it can perfectly grind peppercorns. Love the styling too. We have the matching salt grinder as well. If you love fresh ground pepper on your salads, soups or wherever you like pepper, this is a great tool to add to your kitchen arsenal.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My preteen daughter finally gets up without my threating to turn the bed over. She sets her alarm on her kindle and up she jumps, I LOVE it!!!!
B000FCKBCU|5.0|Laughed the entire way through! Looking forward to reading the other books written by this author. Quick, easy reading. Loved it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome show !  I've watched it twice already ! Cannot wait for season 4, although very sad that Matthew died.
B003ZSH606|5.0|I PUT OFF GETTING THIS FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.  GLAD I FINALLY DID MYSELF THE FAVOR OF GETTING IT.  AWESOME ALBUM.  THEY ARE ALL GREAT IN THEIR OWN WAYS, BUT THIS ONE MAY BE THE BEST SINCE &#34;TRAVELING&#34;.  I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE THAT'S FOR SURE.
B0085YF1E8|5.0|Just love this movie - I wore one copy out! Hugh Grant is awesome as always.  Well worth the money.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|This album is just perfect. So much better -YES!- than Is This It. It has the same DNA but the result is more solid and consistent.
0679805273|5.0|Dr. Seuss classic includes a nice book jacket that matches the front of the book if you choose to remove it. Bigger than some of the other Seuss books in our bookshelf.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Super!!!! Super!!!!!super!!! Thriller- mystery _ drama!!!!!! Life- live- death- lies-- truth-_ all in. One book- many characters- well developed- well written
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Loving the Babel album! I think all music lovers can appreciate the beauty of the lyricsand the driving force of the music!
B008M7BQHE|5.0|This is another great season of Fringe. Oh Olivia! His do you keep getting yourself into such a pickle?! And Dr. Bishop! Your food lust and inability to call your laboratory companion by her proper name keeps me in stitches! But let's not forget about good old Peter. Everyone loves Peter. So strong. So handsome. But what happens when he finally gives over his heart to love? You'll just have to wait and see!!! Goodness... I feel flush just reliving the series! It is my reason to leave my bed. My rock. My island. I know that Fringe Season 3 is never gonna give me up, never gonna let me down.
B0015AARJI|4.0|One of the best custom controller ever seen, its feel great and I would  recommended this to everyone Thanks you Sony!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I like this game because it is a real mystery, a &quot;who done it&quot; story line. I'm playing it now and the graphics and details are great. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes hidden object games and mysteries.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|From the start to the end, this dries was intriguing, thought-provoking and funny. Whedon assembled a great writing staff and well-oiled ensemble staff with guest stars that added to the show's diversity.<br /><br />I wish it had not ended so soon.
B000I0GGSW|4.0|Good adventure movie!<br /><br />Michael Douglas was great as always.  I don't usually like movies with so much violence, but this held my interest. I didn't know Japan had a mob until this movie.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|I never read this in high school, but I'm glad that I'm reading it as an adult.  I don't think I would have appreciated it if I'd read it at a younger age.
B004XWLN20|2.0|2discs scratched . very tight getting discs out. this company were idiots that that madfe the inside of box. the smallville series it self is 5 stars. the box on the inside with discs is two stars.
B00A1OZBSQ|5.0|Essential info for anyone eating food! Especially processed food. Informative and revealing. How the Big Food Corps get you to consume and consume more of their products.
B003OPUZYY|5.0|THIS IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. GREAT SOUND. 5 STARS . BUY IT. IT IS REALLY GOOD. YES GO FOR IT
B007REV4T8|5.0|The film is a non-stop thrill ride before the titles are finished. The special features are as stunning as the film. I can't imagine how the film got made without actually injuring or killing someone.
B00B9LNLTQ|3.0|This time they all worked on the album in the same place, but it didn't help. Only three songs that i really enjoyed. One Way trigger, 50/50 and All the time. I found the rest of the album very boring. This 80's sound is not working for them and the songs lack a little attitude or edge. They sound like a tired band.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|The movie went beyond my expectations and I'll view it again. Tense, true thriller, well directed, exceptional cast and special features.<br /><br />Ted
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series should have been continued and I and many other fans miss it. I'm glad I now have the complete series.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Exceptional cast and production value from the opening to the unexpected ending. every member of the cast and crew made to story work.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a great game playing it is a great time i would recommend it for everyone to play fighting against other players is good
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is one of the best, if not THE BEST sci-fi series I've seen since the original Star Trek with William Shatner and Leonard Nemoy!  Supernatural writers give us just the right amount of humor, sexual overtones, monsters and social/family interactions that make you feel warm and fuzzy all at the same time.  GREAT writers, actors, director, special effects team, etc.  A GREAT production overall.  Props to the producers!!!  Highly recommended for anyone who loves sci-fi.
B001XUPD94|3.0|I'm a huge Star Trek fan.  Yes, I've seen all the movies and series with the exception of DS9 which I never really could get in to.  I thought the whole plot of their 'Search for God' was a bit cheesy and philosophically shallow. The whole movie just didn't seem to fit in the typical Star Trek genre.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun!!! If I could give it infinite stars, I would.I would recommend this to anyone!!!! Get it,it's awesome!!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This item seem to be the firs app that I open every morning. I get up to date info for today's golf game and what kinda clothes to wear. AGAIN, I just like it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I absolute love this is extreme it have a series of hungry shark Justin bieber Beyonce Jay Z even play it it is like you are in the ocean with people fish and you are eating it
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This movie was funny and I enjoyed watching it with my husband and my granddaughter who is 5 years old. She watched it 5 times. She wasn't scared at all, which was my initial concern.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|How many words do I need to relay how much I love listening to them sing?  Not 20!  Double Wow!!
0525952926|4.0|My husband has not started reading it yet.  I will let you know how it is when he does read it.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|Exciting....unique..A story to ponder long after you finish reading....a must for literary circles...a philosophical look at what is real & what is fantasy
B005UG53NS|5.0|I love this final installment of the harry potter series, It was easy to buy and watch on my PS3
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I love this group and the first album is awesome! I can not wait to hear more great stuff from them!
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book hooks you.  It is a harrowing tale of what Big Food has done to us, and their half-hearted attempts to undo the damage.  If you need motivation to wean yourself off processed foods, this is Step 1.  Eminently researched, clearly written, solid investigative journalism.
B001AQT0RC|2.0|Had not seen this movie in a long, long time, and it just does not hold up.  Plot holes galore, cheesy dialogue, manipulative devices to elicit desired, viewer reactions.  Just not a very good movie at all.  Though, Jodie Foster does give a good performance.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My battery life was horrible before this app...like \\"I'm ready to return this thing!\\" bad.  As soon as I installed this app, my problems were solved.  Instead of a day of battery life, I get a week or more!
B0094K20FK|5.0|Khan was the best villain in all of TOS and he saved the franchise from the garbage heap created by the ST motion picture!  This is a must see in the Star Trek canon,
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|I put this fan up against the Noctua NF-F12 which as running at 1500RPM, but the NF-S12A runs at 1200RPM and it produced better results at a slower speed.<br /><br />So here we have a fan that can run considerably slower than others but yet produce the same or better performance results, I'd say that in itself is a pretty good reason to get one.<br /><br />The Noctua NF-S12A PWM fan is very much worthwhile especially if you value performance and silence as it offers a balanced combination of both.<br /><br />Overall I'm impressed with the NF-S12A, it offers excellent cooling performance at slow speeds. The fan can work great to keep your CPU cool or you could use it with a radiator or just as a regular case fan.<br /><br />The cable of the fan is rather short, but you usually don't need a long cable if you're using it with a CPU cooler. The short cable is good for this instance. If you're using the NF-S12A as a case fan the short cable isn't so good, but Noctua was kind enough to include an extension cable for just such an occasion.<br /><br />Noctua also included a `Y' adapter so you can quality and easily connect two fans, as you might on a CPU cooler, to just one fan header.
B0023S50DO|2.0|I was hoping for a reasonably well-done film given the acting talent involved, but this was so bad that it was distracting. I would say that Armageddon, while cheesy, is a far better film.
B007NZQU72|5.0|this is the go to book if you are an HSP... she deals with the subject and reader very gently and with understanding, and also makes you feel good about it, which is a neat trick.... this is a great read
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is a really fun game but it has some issues. First off when you try to get on it loads then it goes back to your home page. I was able to fix that by deleting some of my apps. Next when you try to get on it doesn't load properly. I fixed that by getting out of the apps and trying a few more times and if that doesn't work try turning off your device. If the game had no flaws I would definitely give it five stars but the creators of it has to fix it first
B007L5GDGW|2.0|You're just a ball that has to stay on the blue path. It does use motion-sensing so you have to move your phone or tablet, but the enjoyment really just stops there.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Love the colorful images.  Great when you have some down time to just let your finger react to what the eye sees.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Get your train on the tracks and rush to your destination! One of the best games I have played on the android by far. Simple to play, hard to master, great to enjoy!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I read this book on a snowy Sunday, and couldn't put it down. The reader sees life through a dogs eyes, which makes it a very interesting read. Get the tissue box out though, there are some sad moments. This book would not be a book for a child, since there are some adult scenerios. I would definately recomend this book to anyone weather you're an animal lover or not.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Most games with a joystick of any type is quite hard to play without a physical controller on android, but this is by far the best I have come across. This can be attributed to its side-scrolling platform, but this just enhances play as the difficulty of 3D is taken away but replaced with loads enemies flying across your screen with different capabilities. You even get new planes after playing certain levels, which is great when you need that edge to beat a level that you can't do with your favorite plane.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I've love this game. Challenging and fun. I've played it every day since I got it for several hours each day!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is great. The game itself is not that original, but the game-play makes it hard at times to give it the kick it needs. It's a game where you have to get three blocks (or more) of the same color in order to get them to disappear. Added on top of that is the continuous goal of getting the pieces of some special item all the way to the bottom and off the screen. Some levels you just have to get lucky in order to pass them, but some take some real skill in order to pass. The addition of special power-ups to decimate blocks is also comes in very handy.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Story good dragged a lot in the middle picked up GOT going again I had to finish to the end
B004Y042N8|5.0|I believe there are 280 games total, and you can only advance once you finish the one you are presently working on. This game is a great brain exercise, and something to do when you need to pass time. It also won't be quick to finish, so you can rest assured it will take you a while to completely finish it.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I though it would be good, but it was even better.<br />Storyline was interesting and as a ,,of the sea'' person I enjoyed every moment.<br />Cast was very good and all actors have done excellent performances.<br />It was all so real and natural.<br />Gerard Butler was in this film brilliant.<br />Thak you all.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I have not seen the movie and wanted to make sure I read it before I did.  I am sure this book is better than the movie.
B000HZHBIM|4.0|I love Star Trek and this movie is another very good chapter in the lives of the Enterprises crew. It can slow at times, but I just fast forward.
B000MAOLVW|5.0|Please don't buy this for great acting , it's good , but this is a movie about RACE CARS !  That's why you should have a copy.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I like this show a lot. As someone who enjoys futurist and sci-fi centered television this was a nice find.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|As with Grand Prix , a great racing movie. Plus , you know , Steve McQueen ! Buy this and turn the sound UP !
B0018J2QB8|5.0|This is a very good show.  It is very suspenseful and does not get boring.  The acting is great.  You can really feel what Dexter is feeling.  I would recommend this to anyone.
1568363931|4.0|I love these recipes, they're all fairly easy and cute. The only problem is I was hoping for recipes that would last longer, as  I don't have time to prepare recipes daily.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I didn't care too much for the first like 20% of the book. Overall I liked it and enjoyed all of the twists and turns. Oh!! And I adored the fact that Sky wasn't a weak or whining heroine and that she didn't cry at the least little thing. I really liked the fact that Dean cries because it's such a rare thing to read about…it's like a breath of fresh air. : )
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This show was great and I wish it kept going. It has it all, action, drama, comedy and suspense. If you're into sci-fi or westerns this show is a must.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|The content was excellent! A very good series to watch with my kids, we enjoy the movies a great deal.<br /><br />The form of the set was ok.  However, I did expect greater uniformity in the DVDs.  Some have a DVD menu at the beginning and some do not, and one DVD does not really look like it's part of the set, but as if it was taken from a stand-alone movie and put in with the set.  I guess one of the reasons you buy things in sets is so that the discs are in a uniform format...
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fun game. Really makes you think. I like the difficulty setting. This game does challenge you. Adventurous and at times frustrating but if you check your map and use some logic you get through it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The cinematography is breathtaking.  Could this really have happened?... it really doesn't matter...the relationship between the man and the tiger is believable
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Arrow is intense.  Steven Amell plays 3 characters - all the same guy in different aspects of his character- and does it with aplomb!  My family is also watching with me. The pace is great and i like it that they've let certain folks know about the arrow.  Great action likeable characters and riveting plots!!
B008469DGY|3.0|I love golf games in video format as they have always been s welcome challenge when I'm in the mood, however I really expected more out of this game.  In my mind it is a bit juvenile, and it just doesn't seem to be advanced enough to keep me captivated round after round. If much rather set up golf shots with a virtual golf club rather than flicking a ball with my finger.
0307888908|1.0|No, there isn't.<br /><br />Just more advice about how you need to be ever more persistent and creative and that you need to be able to adapt your vision as you go along.<br /><br />That's the whole book.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|It takes a bit of practice to get the cut going perfectly, but it does exactly what it's supposed to do!  The more tricky part is getting the bottles to break exactly where you want them to, but that also takes practice and isn't anything to do with the product itself, but your bottle selection and the method you use to make the break clean.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Best show on TV !!! Wish it was on a differant chanel because of sports interference on timing. Used to be i think on Weds. Time slot is good.
B00005YW4H|5.0|The songs are rich and deep and filled with the tones that are only those of Norah Jones. She is fantastic and this CD shows her skills.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I was hoping that they would some day get this game on the Amazon market the graphics are good and the gameplay is wonderful
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones at her best. The songs are well-mastered and full of her beautiful songs. This was a good purchase.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It has the best graphics especially that it's a mobile game and I was lucky enough to get it on sale
B004DLPXAO|4.0|While I thoroughly enjoy the Kindle app, it has drawbacks. When attempting to use e-books from other sources,  the kindle app tends to fall seriously short with correct formatting or fails completely to even open the book. It does however work flawlessly with everything I've ever downloaded directly from Amazon. Specific instances would include tablature music and manuals in pdf format.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|A total waste of 99c.  This game would not download completely getting to 99% and starting over.  After 2 days of trying, I finally deleted it.  I play Cubistry and thought that this game would be fun, but don't waste your money or time.
1616550414|5.0|Bigger and prettier than I imagined. There's so many things to read, to study, so many pretty images and drawings, so many conceptions that were unused.<br />This is THE book about The Legend of Zelda, with unimaginable explanations, observations, all about it.<br />Just loved it. Absolutelly amazing.
B000HX4ZF6|4.0|action,action and great acting .i didn,t know mel had it in him---plus the story line was good,something for everyone young and old
B000FBJEL0|5.0|Very suspenseful.  Mr. Kellerman is very familiar with his subjects and it shows in his writing.<br />I have read almost all of his books and enjoyed them all.  .
B004GHNIRK|1.0|this was sooo boring.i know there are die hard les mes fans out there who will probably read this but it was really dull and stupid and dont even get me started on the movie.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I found it to be one of those films that I wished had lasted longer. It was beautiful to look at but for me in a strange and different way. It all comes together in the end. I think?
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I brought this CD off of one song and the rest of the CD does not disappoint either. Great singer, great CD.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Back in the 1960s/1970s, I was into singer/song writers of the time,<br />Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, and Kris Kristofferson, just to name a<br />few.<br /><br />Searching for Sugar Man tells the story of a singer/song writer<br />long forgotten and unheard of till someone starts a search from,<br />of all places, South Africa.  Very much enjoyed this movie that<br />was filmed entirely with an iPhone and edited down with an<br />Apple Mac Pro.<br /><br />My favorite part of this documentary was the scenes of the<br />Sugar Man's 1st concerts and how much the South African<br />fans loved him.<br /><br />Now in his 70s, glad to see the Sugar Man making a few dollars<br />so late in life and getting some recognition for his talent.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|Bear in mind, this is a free product. If you want it to jump through hoops, spend money. For me, it beats having a beat up paper map stuck in the glove compartment or (somewhere) under the passenger seat. If I'm in no-signal National Forest, I can find out where I am and where I need to go because it's offline available. Yes, it takes a number of taps to get the zoom into a meaningful perspective. It takes little effort and little time, complainers - jeez! I'd highly recommend this. It's on my Android 2.2 tablet.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game it is so much fun it is so hard to put it down.<br />Kathleen
1616550414|5.0|This book brought joy and happiness to my heart and soul!  I fell asleep with it in my arms.  Highly recommended!
B009M7G1PU|3.0|Wanted to read this for years and I'm glad I did. Really interesting use of language. Very different to how books are written now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is highly entertaining.  My adrenaline glads got a good workout.  Thank you Howey for an absolutely captivating read but curse you for destroying my sleep schedule!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I really dont like . It it reminds me of my grandma and she wrote one and that makes me sad im so srry but i hate it
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I watched all 8 seasons from start to finish. it was truly addicting. Were the move you promised ? i need now
B00439MV42|5.0|Shared this movie series with my kids and they enjoyed all the movies very much. The original was everyone's favorite of the 3 and part 3 came in second. Part 2 was the least favorite although still liked. The only real issue is there is more language used than is necessary. Wouldn't have missed it if it wasn't used.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love reading Stephen King....he's like putting on an old favorite sweater. This story is told by a man who goes back in time to witness and change one of the most tragic events in our history. All of the old clichés come to mind...&#34;it kept me on the edge of my seat&#34; and &#34;I couldn't stop reading it to see what happened next&#34;. When it ended, I wanted to keep reading more.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|There is no going wrong with this cd - it has a little bit of everything from fun songs to dance around to and beautiful balads. So happy with this purchase!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Die App gefällt mir sehr gut. Es zeigt einem alles an z.B. wann man zu letzt geladen hat und wann der Akku Lehr war. Ich bin sehr zufrieden und kann diese App nur weiter empfehlen. :)<br /><br />PS: für das das sie kostenlos ist, ist sie sehr sehr gut. :)
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I need to drop some pounds. I only flipped through the science of the diet. Some of it too technical and boring.<br />But the Fast Diet does work. well it is on me. I lost 4lbs in 3 Fasting days. That's real weight lose, it's staying off.<br />Semi fasting for a day can make you irritable later in the day. Your partner will have to put up with that if they want a slimmer healthier model.<br />I'm sticking with the 10 days of fasting recipes that are in the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Brilliant game really addictive i love it! Its that good that i want to start buying coins i recommend you to download this game have fun!
1400079144|3.0|I think 3 out of 5 stars is a very fair review here and I will tell you why. This book will NOT wow you like Angels or Davinci. This book is formulaic and predictable. Dan Brown has started to follow a formula which will put off the critical readers. A) Introduce a new character B) He is the antagonist C) He is trying to overthrow the government, church, cult, etc. Every plot twist in this novel is as predictable as my last sentence.<br /><br />Redeeming factors: Dan Brown brings in the BEST cultural/ artistic/ relevant references of any author I have read. Who doesn't want to hear about the CIA's cryptic sculpture referencing an underground staircase in DC?<br /><br />Overall, Dan Brown is great; the Lost Symbol is formulaic. By itself, could have been the next DaVinci Code, as a sequel? Repetitive. Interesting but forgettable. Great author, poor effort. Borrow it from the library, don't buy it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have read a few different versions of The Wizard of Oz and as expected, this book was great and full of adventure!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|What an incredible series.  Kevin Spacey deserves and Oscar for his role in this movie series.  Very believeable and probably an educated glance into how congress really works.  This is a must for viewing.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Them hoes always Be trifling ads bouncing themselves butts in fact street on day way to gets them some fried chickens
B00A5IYCYM|5.0|A long, but very well-paced, story of a 16th century village of poor Japanese farmers who are periodically raided by a troop of bandits soon after they harvest their crops. They send emissaries to find a group of samurai to defend them, although they can only pay with food. Seven (six plus a novice) samurai are recruited by the first samurai who accepts their offer. The samurai all act with great integrity and are worthy companions with differing characters. A long film (over three hours) that nonetheless holds your interest throughout. After a lapse of decades, this is the second time that I have gladly seen this movie.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|Helpful tool in a new journey started. As with most of these types of books it is fairly repetitive, but I need brainwashing ... or maybe de-briefing ... so it works for me!
B005DKLPF6|5.0|Mastodon continues to evolve and get even better. They are the best metal act to emerge in the last decade, and this album legitimizes this claim. Buy it or fail at life.
B0053O89IS|5.0|We started watching this series, getting discs from our library and then were hooked,  I'd recommend this highly for the acting and making three women think, hold good jobs and laugh.  Most enjoyable.
B0082LUEW8|5.0|A very nice edition to any Metalhead's collection a must have for hard hitting in your face music. It certainly keeps you wanting more.
B009POCG5Y|4.0|As usual, Clint Eastwood does a superb job! Not your usual baseball movie but very charming plot.<br />Romance, sports and all that goes with the sport's business end make for an enjoyable film.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Sorry I did not care for this at all. Confusing how to play with others. I ended up undownloading it from my phone and kindle.
B0099116AY|4.0|Very humorous movie geared to middle aged adults. Sexy and fun relating to middle age doldrums.!<br />Meryl Streep does her usual fine acting - an enjoyable episode!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app has lots of problems. I had it before and it would constantly shut itself off and other issues. I am trying for the 2nd time. Hope it goes better
B0070YDOT8|3.0|Just got my kindle and am getting use to playing on it.  I do love big fish games and was glad to see it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter to play. She loves it. She wants a horse more than anything and this is the next best thing.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I am still getting use to my Kindle.  I enjoy this game but it seems different from others I have played.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter to play. she enjoys it a lot. It is challenging for her but that is good. More than just a mindless game.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|When you read the biographies of these three talented individuals, you can understand how this wonderful CD was born.  They had it all- experience, exceptional song writing abilities, and beautiful voices.  Kenny Loggins is not overly featured, just one of the trio; which shows he has the best interest of the group at heart, not his ego.  Bravo.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Like the book, he tells it like it is. the book was so good, I had a hard time putting it down.
1476733953|5.0|Not sure what I can say about this book that hasn't been said already so I will not even try.  Just let it be known that I own the Kindle, paperback and hardback versions of this.  Now I just need to meet Hugh to get 2 out of 3 of those signed.
1400052181|4.0|This is a great book about the history of HeLa cells, informed consent and how medical practices affect us today.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I first watched the movie and fell in love with it but then decided to read the books and I couldn't put it down! I loved it! Amazing isn't even close to the right words to describe how awesome this series was. I wish it was longer because I fell in love with the characters and the cause that they were fighting for!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love this!!!!<br />It really does extend the battery life of my kindle fire.<br />I recommend this free app for kindle fire.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Another strong season of a great show.  Love watching entire seasons through streaming at amazon Prime.  Looking forward to catching season 3 next.
B0063M22QO|5.0|At my age I am always trying to find thing to keep my mind active and this majong kindle edition is perfect for me.  My fear is dementia and I am always looking for something to keep my eyes and brain working.  The colors are great the tiles are perfect for matching.  I just love it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While this will keep you interested to the end, it is not one of Grisham's best. it gets bogged down in some chapters but Grisham manages to pull it off. This is worth reading.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I have been on the road a lot and have used this app and it seem to do what I was looking for. Thanks for the good app
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I have no words to describe how much I loved this book. It was breathtaking.  I cannot wait to read the next one.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have used this a lot in the last 2 weeks. Gives me a good pic of whats out there. Also gives me how good the systems are. Thanks Ron
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this to replace my Kindle wire & was so incredibly happy to learn it also fit my Samsung phone too. Maybe I'm behind everyone else with this tidbit of info but I was so excited.  It has a good amount of length & paying $10 for wire that charges my Kindle & phone was a super score for me :)
B004UID2LC|3.0|also found a better app that did search. Ok for just looking. Need to add search to It<br />well done other that that
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Don't play as much since I got Puss in Boots.  My granddaughter still plays it but she actually likes Puss in Boots better.  More challenge.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love everything about this show. Must see, but be sure to clear your schedule because you won't want to stop watching! Enjoyed watching the instant download on Amazon! Will be using this site for instant videos from now on.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I got it for my granddaughter for trips but I started playing it myself and got hooked.  It's great for passing the time or if you are relaxing or doing laundry.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This movie kept us laughing and none of the humor was inappropriate. Today some of these cartoon films just have way to many underlying adult messages so it was refreshing to watch a movie that actually stays within it's G rating. My entire family enjoyed it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun and goofy pass the time game!  My grandkids will love to play this when they are waiting or have down time!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The story line is excellent and incorporates several contemporary threats in the classic Clancy style.  The pacing of the story was excellent, but could have been developed a little more toward the end.  Still a very good read.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|The story of the super smart, yet socially inept Don and his Projects made for great reading.  The characters were well developed and interesting.<br />A couple of twists kept the storyline from being too simple.<br />I particularly enjoyed Don's in depth thinking processes and his descriptions of now he viewed the world and the people around him.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Have enjoyed this novel for decades.  It's still fresh and interesting, highlighting Clarke's prescience and scientific acumen.  As usual, the plot is engrossing and the science real.  Dr. Clarke has given men and the world many hours of pleasure with his clear and effective narratives.  Highly recommended.
B007HC3LHS|2.0|Confusing.  Shifts from one year to another and back again.  She's dead in the beginning, so how is she writing her story?  I'm reading it now, but have a long way to go and I may quit soon.<br />I will have to be careful of the authors.  This one uses the f-word on almost every page.  Not to my liking?  Won't order one by this author again. I may have to review them before I order.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This has to be one of the best tv shows on television right now.  It doesn't have that fast of a pace, but it's different.  When I had first heard about the show I seriously thought &#34;what a horrible idea for a tv series&#34;; now I can't get enough.  If you are on the ropes about buying this series, just know it's a wise investment.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This was a gift for my 6 year old son who takes karate.  He loves the movie as much as I do.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is  a fast moving story with twists you never see coming.<br />A great way to keep your brain working while being entertained.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|You would think that it wouldn't be as funny the long this series runs but it gets better.  The girls are really hilarious.  Especially Bernadette and its nice to see Stuart more often.  I love the show and I'm looking forward to season 7.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This was a very good movie. I love the song and Daniel Craig makes a really good James Bond. I recommend this movie.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This is really a great game; hard to stop playing; Still a bit confused but having a great  time; I highly recommend it
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This is OK. However I ran out of cards and I am not going to spend money to play a game.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|my son loves dinosaurs and jurassic park. This game allows him to create his own version without the mis-adventures that take place in the movie. he also can learn the benefit of long term saving and reaping the rewards of planning for big rewards.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great Book I really enjoyed reading it. I will also recommended this book to several of my friends and coworkers.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game serves a basic, intrinsic desire to do nothing but swim, eat, and grow. Plus, earning bonus for points for cannibalism and swimmers is always fun!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I wish this show was not cancelled. It is one (or THE) best tv shows ever. Each character is likable, conversations are smart, there is no background laughter sound, the stories are interesting.<br /><br />Pretty much opposite to every current TV show with the exception of Breaking Bad.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|As a 47 year old male, I'm probably not the typical target audience for this book.  My daughter has mentioned it and I thought I would review it before I allowed her to read it.  I think maybe she needs to be a little older first.  However, none of that stopped me from enjoying the book immensely.  I guess I had expected something maybe a little juvenile or sappy and was very surprised instead. The story is very fast paced and the action is rather vivid.  The violence is presented in a very matter of fact way rather than glorified. Katniss is more mature than her age but considering her environment and role growing up it is very believable.  The first person narrative took a bit of getting used to but then I mostly read non-fiction and historical fiction. I will read the next.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is game is fun for all animal lovers and the graphics are really good and clear. i would recomend it to anyone
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|The first half of the movie is a little slow, but so was the fellowship of the ring. There's a lot to set up in this first part of the trilogy.  I can't wait to the next movie.
B00BU2TEGS|5.0|I really do not know what the F is the problem with some other reviewers who are whining about this album not being a \\"true\\" Depeche Mode album. I really don't get these people? What the F do they want DM to do? Basically keep replicating Songs of Faith and Devotion?? And just keep regurgitating the same past without evolving? Jeez people just grow up and open your musical horizons for a second and listen to Delta Machine with an open mind.<br /><br />This album is beautiful. Angel, Heaven, Welcome to My World are stunning songs...just like the rest of the album. The songs have this feel of a barren wasteland where you don't belong, where you have no attachments, no love, no feelings just a transient feeling of hollowness where you see as far as the horizon stretches and are devoid of thought and feel that the best way to deal with the situation is to keep moving and live for the moment. That's what the album is...it is zen. You listen to it in the \\"here and now\\".... you just immerse yourself completely in the songs and don't come on with preconceived ideas or notions. You give yourself upto the genius of Depeche Mode and let them take you for this dark ride. Welcome To My World feels like DM took you and threw you in an ocean of dark matter and you are drowning but you don't really fight it.... you like the sinking feeling.<br /><br />There are very few bands such as Depeche Mode (Chroma Key, Massive Attack and OSI, are similar) where the music sounds simple (as some other fools accused it of sounding like a beat-box with Casio keyboards) but when you listen to it closely there are tons of layers that peel off in each song. Layers of sonic textures, layers of emotions, layers of interpretation through genius lyrics and layers of feelings that you get every time you listen to the album. And I agree that not every song blows you away with its melody the first time but the album is that....it is an entire package. The album takes you on a journey and every song just fits. On the second and third listen the songs grow on you and it is a complete picture of well-fitted parts.<br /><br />Dave Gahan's lyrics are incredible. He is as slick as he was 30 years ago and I think DM is continuing to do a wonderful job at reinventing themselves while staying true to their soul. Delta Machine is a great effort and hits the nail on the head in what a true DM should expect out of this wonderful band. \\"Fans\\" who continue to trash DM aren't really true fans I feel. They are individuals stuck in the past based on ONE album that they really liked and then they expect every album to be exactly like the one.<br /><br />Delta Machine should be heard two ways...1) Pour yourself a stiff drink of single malt scotch....lower the lights in your living room, put on your headphones, increase volume (don't go crazy) and immerse yourself in the textured, grungy, moody ambiance of the album or 2) Listen to it while driving alone on a long road trip...concentrate on the road and the music.... that's it. Don't talk, don't listen to anyone else but the album. If someone is talking ask them to shut up and listen.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I never heard of, much less read, the book upon which people say this film is based. It makes not the slightest bit of difference to me nor should it to anyone else. It seems hardly necessary, after more than a century of film-making, to say that the cognitive impact of a movie is far different from that of a book. A book read  by one's  eyes is far different from a book read by a live actor, or, as I have come to learn from a great many hours of listening, a well constructed robotic voice. (Incidentally, the exasperated remark by Astaire was made to the surviving member of a dance team which Fred and Ginger were portraying on film; she kept interrupting the proceedings with complaints to the director and the actors, to the effect that something was not as they had lived it. The film: The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle-1939.)  As to this picture, Will Smith does a fine job carrying the show on his shoulders. The 'monsters' are suitably vicious and possessed of superior impact because used with discretion. The setting is admirably representative of what NYC might look like. With a bit of slippage at the end (specifying would reveal too much of the plot) the creators maintain an internal logic which lends movie rationality to most of the events.  All in all, not an award-winning film ( if awards were fairly given) but one that is quite watchable and entertaining.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|No I didn't read the book so I didn't know what to expect, was this a kids movie, is it a comedy or what? Suraj Sharma honestly deserved the Oscar and Pi should have gotten best movie. It was one of those &#34;what the heck?&#34; movies. It starts out slow so you are sort of lulled into paying more attention to the special effects than the movie but when the end hits you like a hammer you have to go back and watch it again just to makes sure you understand what happened at the end. It's one of my all time favorite movies now. It is NOT for children.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best shows since the UK's Upstairs Downstairs.  Another great hit! I highly recommend others to watch and they will get hooked.
B005KAH7QU|1.0|For the love this was one stinker of a movie, seriously folks. Saoirse Ronans acting was good but the rest phfft. Remind me why I used to like Cate Blanchet? The plot was so bogus and the violence used just to keep you awake. Never again.
B00AX5HJO2|5.0|Overkill is one of the few heavy metal bands who, while at times changed their sound slightly, but they never changed their formula, which is good old school thrash metal.  This particular album is one of their very best with the tracks &#34;Electric Rattlesnake&#34; and &#34;Wish You Were Dead,&#34; and the groovy &#34;Black Daze.&#34;  This particular issue also includes 4 live bonus tracks from the Australian Ironbound Tour, including &#34;Necroshine&#34; and &#34;Horrorscope&#34;.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|Funny how you love a movie then read the reviews and wonder if others saw the same movie you did. I liked the animation, I liked the plot. It is a bit dark for little kids.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|For those whom are watching this for the first time with an idea of just what/who Hunter S. Thompson was/is, just a quick, yet important note: Do not expect another &#34;Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas,&#34; for that was only one of MANY of his many styles. &#34;The Rum Diary&#34; will not be anything like it, yet will play out greatly to those whom are other works of his.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|A bit of a slow roller in the beginning, but it picks up nicely.<br />You get pulled in and it is a good read.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I love this series. If you are looking into these, you probably have a good idea of what the series is about. I'll just say I highly recommend getting the David Attenborough BBC version instead of the Americanized version. Also, it would be a shame to get these in blu-ray instead of DVD if you have the option, the high-def is really worth the extra few dollars.
0307730697|5.0|More than detailing one man's sacrifice in battle, this book humanizes the price of sending men to war. A little heavy on religion, but that was an integral part of what made this hero the man that he was. Reading the story of his life made me want to be a better man
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|fast and rapid .... click click click my idea of a pure time spender! All I can say is Facebook connects to this game and that makes it way more fun!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|As a reformed Literati, who spends most of his reading time on history, biography, and thrillers, I resisted the temptation to read Life of Pi, as it seemed too, well, literary. When I got to it, though, it turned out to be eminently readable, with far less mysticism and far more realism than I expected. Without giving away the ending, however, I was not as impressed with the hook, and I felt a little disappointed that it didn't make me believe in God, as is promised at the beginning of the story.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a great tool to have when taking indoor pictures.  I have the Nikon D60 SLR and love how this flash improves indoor pictures.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This was always my go to weather app until the latest update. Honestly, why &quot;fix&quot; something that isn't broken?! Now I'm forced to use a lesser weather source. Please go back to the faster, more user-friendly interface. Please!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I'm surprised it took me this long to start watching this program but once I saw season one series one I finished all the series in a couple weeks . I was addicted to this program so be careful you might too.
0307949508|5.0|Good book; but, remember to read it after the &#34;Girl who kicked the hornet's nest&#34;.  I read them in the wrong order.  Still intriguing and exciting.  Could do less with the lesbian scenes but may be a thing with this author.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is for my 3 year old great-grandson.  He loves it and has had a lot of fun when he comes to our house and finds something exciting to do at G G's (great-grandma's) house.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I have always loved STNG, an it's even better when I can watch it for free on my phone, highly recommend
B005GXQFBE|5.0|Been looking for a couple of Mike Francis songs and iTunes didn't have it. So i was happy i got the CD, plus other songs i haven't heard before.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Niece loves her horses. Plays this game all the time whenever she comes over. It's a cute game but expensive.
0307341550|2.0|I read Dark Places and liked it a lot. This book, however, was disappointing. I had to force myself to finnish it. Most of the characters were unbelievable, especially Camille's mother and sister, I found the \\"psychological aspect\\" (the self mutilation etc) forced and contrived, and so was a lot of the dialog.<br />I would not recommend this book at all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's a great app and I'm so glad that they have it on kindle .it work the same way that would on an iPod or iPad.it's easy to use, some apps on kindle are harder to use on kindle but not this
B001NLKWLW|5.0|ms Morton has the gift of weaving the threads of a story in both a natural and supernatural way.  The reader uncovers each part of the story much the way one does in life.  ms Morton takes it a step further by describing the delicate feelings which surface with each turn in the story.  Powerful story told with wonderful skill.
B003VANOFY|3.0|It was a good headset with wireless function and that, but I have a noise/crackling sound in the headset that doesn't disappear. Do not buy! Buy Corsair venganance 2000 then!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun to watch.  The good girl that works hard gets what she deserves for her hard work.  I enjoyed this movie.
B000002IWH|4.0|I have been looking for this cd almost everywhere. I didn't reallt want to buy it online but I'm glad I did. It was faster and cheaper then I thought it was going to b
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This movie, Oscar aside, really surprised me with how well done it was. I wont say much about the movie itself, because even though it's a historical account of an actual event, it's not a well known event (at least on the personal level as this is).<br /><br />This could have been chock full of violence and profanity (which I'm not saying I DON'T like by any means), but drives the message home in a far more unique way - creating a false sense of paranoia and making every other moment feel like the group is completely going to fail.<br /><br />Even if you call the ending from a mile away or know what happens, it's safe to say you knew there wasn't going to be a twist. That's what was so good about this movie, I knew everything that was going to happen - but it still stressed me out beyond belief and that is what made this movie so impressive to me.<br /><br />Generally 2 hours of dialogue with hardly any action would put me right to sleep, but Argo manages to break that barrier and present a great historical account in a way that makes you really feel like you were there a few decades ago. On an end note, the comparison at the end with the real people against Afflak's cast just made it all the more real.<br /><br />Spectacular! Definitely worth a watch... I purchased it on release date, but it probably will be a long time to come before I watch it again - it's one of those amazing one-shot films, so a rent may be worth your money... but I do support purchasing it by all means!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love it! It is just hard enough, but not impossible. The cut scenes were great, animation was awesome and the plot keeps moving.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  The music has a great beat and we listen to it in the car.
0345803485|1.0|Sounds like a teenager wrote it. Her fantasies are childish and her monologue makes me cringe. Every time she refers to her &#34;inner goddess&#34; I think of those Venus razor commercials. Christian sounds like a dork. No storyline, no plot... just endless 'scenes' that go nowhere. Possibly the worst book I've ever read.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Dungeon hunter 3 is an amazing Lord of the rings- esqe action and adventure game, with phenomenal graphics and a cool overhead view, making you feel like you are actually watching the battle right there. Ignore the haters, this game rocks.<br /><br />-Ziri
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My husband and I love this show, and it was fun to go back and watch the first season.  We're looking forward to watching the second!  The quality of the HD is great and made the experience even better than the first time around.
B000H4TX9I|4.0|While it isn't perfect, I enjoyed Firefly very much and rewatch it every 3 years or so. It is fun sci-fi action with interesting characters.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|My husband and I have had many great hours of enjoyment watching the re-runs of Columbo. Would recommend to anyone who is tired of watching the same things on TV. A Fresh program.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Wow! I love this game. Just 16 cards (plus 4 reference cards, scoring cubes, and rule booklet) in a red velvet drawstring bag. Easy to learn, plays quickly, and completely addictive. Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the greatest game for gamers. i like it but the guy is a little anonying. he keep on going you need er better shape blah blah blah.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|my son and I really loved this game. Spent a lot of time unlocking the sharks and then once we got to the hammer head shark the whole game reset. Not a happy camper :/
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Why We Get Fat was a phenomenal read. It makes you wonder how much bad sciences is actually out there.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Buy the game. Play the game. Love the game. Get the extras. Be freaked out by the zombie infection. That is all!
B009K86D86|5.0|This film empowers he viewer through knowledge of how your food is actually being produced. Consumers actually have the power to change big agricultural companies by voting with their pocketbook for local, organic, environmentally friendly foods!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy Jackson is awesome. This book really is one of the best books in the series. Getting attacked by the Minotoar on Half Blood Hill. Fighting Medusa. Destroying Ares. This a great novel without going through it to fast or slow.
0736092269|5.0|Excellent illustrations! I am still absorbing this book.  For specific exercises describes what muscles will be worked, how to do the motions, when to breath, and other variations for the exercise. Also talks about common injuries to muscles and joints.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|Our greatgrandson is 3 and he loves anything with wheels.  This is large enought that he races around pushing it in the house.  He also fills it sand from the sandbox and dumps it.  Grand entertaining toy.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I bought the first 4 series and of course had to have this one - brilliant<br />Have reviewed the previous 4 series
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great book with lots of action and drama 100%great book!!!!!!!reading this book was great but the finale will be even better!
B003TTCURU|5.0|Im not your average soap opera lover however this series has an informative and interesting flow to it. It is well written and witty.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This little amp is incredible !! is now the pre amp for a 400 watt sound bar. Unbelievable how much it improved the power 10 fold. Just buy it you will thank yourself.
B00ABO573A|1.0|Wrong type of moving for me. I'm not specifying wrong type meaning gay either, ..because  I  have no problem with gay movies in fact a lot of them provide good insight. It was just poorly written. A  &#34;B&#34; rater so to speak  I guess I was desperate for something new to watch that day ugh...spare me.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|I absolutely love the soundtrack! I bought the MP3 so that I can listen to it in my car. Wonderful!
B002BIULQ2|5.0|My daughter enjoys all the songs and the funny parts in this movie. It is a good family movie for all ages.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game and so do both of my grandsons. The application is well worth the very affordable price.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the era and the actors are very compelling.  Story line is like reading a novel and you just can't wait to start the next chapter.  Excellent.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is certainly an entertaining movie and nothing I would expect to see George acting in.  I watched it twice and enjoyed it even more the second time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the characters portrayed.  The era in history is very interesting to me.  Actors are skilled.  Love Maggie Smith!!  Like reading a great novel....you can't wait to find out what happens next.
0375703764|4.0|This book is pretty amazing, but not a good book to read casually. It reads like an essay, for the most part, and can be horribly dry at times. I can't read it if I'm sleepy or just looking to relax, but if you can make time to devote your brainwaves to it, it is really an incredible read. Very creepy, also don't read it at night O_O
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a real romantic and he puts a spiritual spin on this book which was, to me, unpredictable. The abusive factor was uncomfortable for me, not as a victim but as a bystander who feels so helpless to those in need of a safe haven and can't or won't  take that first step.  It started out a little slow for me but it picked up and I found myself wrapped up in it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|hot guys, sexy girls, fast cars, rock and roll reference at every turn AND all the supernatural mythological mayhem you can imagine!!! This is by far my favorite series ever!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|What a great story of forgiveness and grace!  This is one we can watch over and over and continue to learn more about how we should treat those who are unkind to us.  Jesus said that we should love our enemies.  Hard work but what a legacy of love!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is like a whole new world where u can escape a cop and run without passing out love it
B009K86D86|5.0|My husband and I watched this together and were horrified by some of the ways food is being grown and processed.  We have made several changes to our shopping and eating habits in direct response to this documentary.  If you're not prepared to change the way you eat, you probably want to skip this one!
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Very clear, very logical and the points are backed up scientifically. If you want a lot of detail, read his other book, Good Calories, Bad Calories. But if you just want to get the main gist, buy this one.    I followed his recommendations and in 5 months I'm 80 pounds lighter, have lots more muscle, much better stamina, more energy, thinking more clearly and find myself more emotionally stable than ever. My resting heart rate went from nearly 100 to 60, and my blood pressure from borderline dangerous to 114/72 yesterday. All the heart changes occurred long before any weight loss-I lost weight because I started eating healthy food, which is plenty of animal fat, adequate meat and eggs and no grain or sugar at all. I never counted a calorie, did any exercise or went hungry.    EDIT: August, 2014. It's been nearly two years and I'm down 135 pounds. Still don't count calories, still never go hungry. Do 10 minutes of weightlifting once a week and that's it. Feel better and am far stronger and more active at almost 40 than I was at 20.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Great read worth every page, may great twists and turns in this great mystery novel. Part one of Mr Reachers Adventures a big tick
B0000039QA|5.0|this is a legendary double cd  &#34;NOTORIOUS BIG&#34;,as usual great rapping with several rap artists,bought this when it first came out,it was great then an still is today,legendary rapper!!!!!!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great actors, well written and fun to watch since it is a bit over the top.  Plus it is free on Amazon Prime!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game runs very slow at times and it freezes up also.  You don't get many blue coins very often and when you play the game with them you don't get much.  It's a past time though.
B009K6GLUS|5.0|These contemporary two-packs (or three packs) we buy often collect different and unconected albums; this one is an exception; in addition to being beautiful,<br />these two \\"at the Village Gate\\" albums make a logical pairing for this CD.<br /><br />On both albums Coleman Hawkins plays his tenor (the mighty tenor) with Tommy Flanagan (p), Major Holey (who occasionally sings with his bass) and Eddie Locke (dm);<br />on first album he shares spotlight with Roy Eldridge and Johnny Hodges...<br /><br />Need I say more? These two line-ups of musicians deliver. It's swinging, it's intelligent; the first album is more in the swing mode, the second more mainstream.<br />Precisely in my taste range. If you're fan of any of these musicians, buy it.<br /><br />If you still don't know Hawk, this might be a good place to start.
B003R0MF1W|4.0|I love this show and love the series I bought them all, but this is the only one that came broken and ripped all down the side. I was really upset because returning stuff is such a hassle
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent program. I have watched all three seasons. I cannot wait for season four. I really enjoy it and highly recommend.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This is a great and very fun game, some times it crashes and takes a long time to load but other than that it is a great game. I would give is 4.6 stars!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is inspiring, interesting and fun. The music is great and adds another element to gameplay. This was free but would be well worth the regular price.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is very good and has great graphics and 3d effect aand at first it is easy but then everything costs so many coins and it takes so long to have enough coins for one upgrade.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I have only heard Muse a few times on Minnesota Public Radio but I am very impressed with the polished solid sound they put out with this album. Well thought out and professionally done.
0783240236|5.0|My second favorite,action and heart warming,very entertaining not shown much on tv.I think it is the best of alfred hitchcock
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|I love Depeche Mode and have been thrilled by every album, until now. I feel some of this music is not well rounded and even some of the singing sounds rushed and not very well polished. They could have done better but I still like it, just don't love it.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|The bootleg did not do it justice. It is better to purchase or rent the the dvd, two thumbs up.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I would recommend this show to any body who likes scifi and a sense of adventure. All the seasons are good too watch.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Very original, I love everything about it. Could not have been better, I will have to buy this dvd one day.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|great book loved it. it has a very great story and interesting characters.it a book that would have you looking forward to the next chapter or next book
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Should have waited for this one. Cannot believe I actually spent money to rent this. This move should be for free, don't pay for it, its a waist precious.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the game and its a great time waster but I hate the ads in the beginning of every game but over all its a nice game and its not like one of those stupid meaning full games
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I give this movie two thumbs up. Even though Schwarzenegger did not star it was still a really good movie.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Mindblowing information.  Makes trips to the grocery store a whole new experience.<br />I would highly recommend this book to everyone who eats!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I like the thread running through this show as well as the individual episodes.  Cast of characters appear and reappear so they become aquaintences.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|Everyone should read this.  It is amazing!  I loaned my first copy out and didn't get it back, so I bought it again!
B00BF11STU|5.0|The film &#34;Argo&#34; is very good, but this is unquestionably a superior film. In its success in telling a complex and morally-ambiguous story, it  offered a rare challenge to today's cinema goer. The acting is up to that high caliber. It is best to set aside the various controversies (and not infrequently over-the-top criticism) directed at the film while actually viewing it, and appreciate this unusually fine work.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter does it. This season is a must! The twist and turns are unprecedented! Can't get enough of Dexter and the Trinity Killer, wow. Great TV.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Stayed up till it was finished. Best book in a long time<br />Made me cry and laugh together. Now I can see the movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Its very entertaining, and you will immediately get drawn into each and every episode, wanting more. My favorite character is the dad. He  gets pissed but he never lets them see him sweat. He's my kinda man...
B0091REZMW|3.0|Looks like another game I played. It is fun to play. Good graphics.Interesting themes. Not to difficult to play. It is free so it is a good deal.
B0065GC0BA|1.0|Way too freakin depressing for me...a vital human cut down in his prime, an aimless wastrel hired to look after him...some so called love story that never would have happened had the vital one stayed vital...no thanks-I'd rather live the crap things in my own life than read the fictional crap things of someone else!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|A beautiful movie, well done.  I've seen it twice and loved it the first time at the theater.  I think I enjoyed it even more the second time on Amazon.
0440236304|1.0|Scary people shouldn't be allowed to have their rants published. This author was a crazy heartless narcissist who had no feelings for any of the humans that he came across or cut down. Disgusting-I burnt this book.
B009K0P10K|5.0|It is a good story and interesting characters.  I really like this series and always look forward to the next episode.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|Loved the message and passion involved in this tale. Great performance by all.lHuge Gosling fan was sold by actors initially
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|I really liked all three of the Lord of the Rings movies, so I had high expectations for the Hobbit.  Unfortunately, it does not compare.  The first two hours move very slowly.  There are a lot of special effects but after enough of them they get kind of boring.  The best of the Hobbit is what is left over from Lord of the Rings.  My wife went to sleep during the movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I started out really liking this book. It is well written & very suspensful at first. But as I got further into the book & the story developed, I started to feel as if I was being led around by the author on a very mentally sick & cruel journey. I hated most of the characters, & felt sorry for a few. I know very well that in every story the author plays God, but here, as the reader, I felt like a fool for caring for anyone. This type of action may well be true to life,  but it holds out no hope for the human conscience & soul. Perhaps that is the message, and as Ayan Rand said,  this is just the &#34;banality of evil &#34; once again exposed to those of us who don't get it yet.
B009LROCJI|5.0|It gives Vivaldi a sprucing up just like his rediscovery did when LP records allowed more people to discover him.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Edge of your seat thriller, unable to put  the book down, eye opening mans inhumanity to man story, and it continues to this day in North Korea.  So happy I found this book and it was available for Kindle.  Keep up the great work Amazon.  Also authors like Blaine Harden, thank you for searching into our world and sifting out injustices to humankind and bringing them to light, only then can all live in peace.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Huge zombie fan. This comic book really puts things into perspective. It's never the dead we should fear. It's the living. Including our own conscience
B00BWJARHO|3.0|It's good, really it is.  Just certain areas lag with tiring dialog.  I fell asleep twice and had to re-watch twice just to figure where out where I had left off.  I know it is part of  a series so the jury is out and I will not condemn this interesting film.  Chock full of great effects and fantasy characters.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great pass time while watching TV. Also keeps the mind active. Competition with my husband. Also great pastime while traveling
0307951529|5.0|A must have for any entrepreneur or wanna be entrepreneur.  Inspirational, educational and easy to read. I highly recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|How refreshing!!! When all you see on TV and movies is sex and violence and no real story behind it. It's so nice to have a great story, romance without the unnecessary sex scenes, evil charactors plotting without the blood shed and the wardrobe designer for the ladies of Downton Abbey is outstanding.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I kept having to replace the original charge that came with my Kindle Fire.  This cable has worked perfectly since I received it.  I love that the plugs fold away and you can store the cable and connecter in a plastic bag out of site.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|We all remember Doc Brown in &#34;Back to the Future&#34; telling Marty McFly that any interaction or change he makes in the time-space continuum can have serious repercussions in the future. This is Stephen King's version of what would happen if someone could go back in time to save JFK from being assassinated. The journey of the main character back in time is funny, sad, tragic, heroic. King's attention to detail about that era is what makes the book such a great read, whether you like the ending or not. A thoroughly enjoyable read.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I purchased it for a course I am doing but anyone who loves babies or just wants to have a look at some different cultural practices would love it.  The filming is great and it is a feel good movie- good watching for all ages with special appeal to young children who want to keep on watching it again!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This app is easier than most to setup, use and turn off.  The other functions are a nice add.  Be sure to keep it plugged into 115v if possible when using all of the functions.  It is hard on battery life, as they indicate.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love castle!!! It has everything. Crime, drama, comedy, and romance. I love the relationship and romance between Beckett(Stana Katic) and Castle (Nathan Fillion).Great supporting cast as well. Excellent writers.
0743289692|5.0|As great a page turner as any fiction, yet this memoir is the true experience of a young girl, born & bred in Somalia, who found her way to the Dutch Parliament. After describing the honor killings tolerated by the Dutch Government and criticizing Sharia Law & customs, her good friend (who'd done the same) was murdered with a note pinned to his chest threatening her next. She now lives, under guard, in the US.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|. It's a fun way to relax. It's easy to learn. This game is lots of fun. Somewhat addictive. I highly recommend it, especially for horsey people who want a game on the go.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is amazing. I sobbed for at least an hour while reading it, yet still the best book I have ever read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the concept of this show!  I find it really interesting to see not only how the aristocracy lived in those times, but their servants as well.  It's really informative and entertaining to see how the two different worlds interact with and depend on each other.  The humor is great, I love how sarcasm is used as both sword and shield in confrontations.  My only disappointment is that I cannot watch season 3 for free with my Prime account!
B0071R43MG|5.0|Felt like being AGAIN at one of his concerts<br />What is your purpose... Rock on Joe new album coming out in June
B00B1MHXY2|4.0|Brings back a lot of memories, college days and just a great time period for great music all around. Seventies and early eighties were super music times.
1419705849|5.0|We love Jeff Kinney and have every single Diary of a Wimpy Kid books. My 12 year old will still read them. My 7 year old now loves them and I hope there is another on the way soon!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The zombie whacking gets a bit repetitive.  To see which character gets sacrificed to the rating gods makes it worthwhile.  Michonne  rocks.  I hope to see the Governator get his, though not too soon, and I hope Andrea get a potty break while waiting in that dental chair for her next appearance.
B005USZML4|4.0|This is a book for all ages and a well-written series. I feel the books are a bit over priced given their length, but that would be my only complaint.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|What can I say but Gossip Girl is a great show and season 6 is one of the best season, mostly because of Chuck and Blair :)
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Can't wait for the walking disaster!!  I am anxious to read this book from Travis's point of view!!! I loved this book!!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I didn't like this app mostly because you couldn't make playlist. I can do that on my little phone you would think I could on my kindle.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Ben's performance is phenomenal in a movie about a true story with drama at its best!  Definitely the movie is worth watching.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Such an amazing show... Love her!!!!  She makes you feel like you are sitting in her living room with her having a cup a tea charting away!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved it some made me laugh some made me it has a real messages hidden in side like everything in life
B003H6KRIE|5.0|My son is 1500 miles from home, in college on a limited budget. My daughter just moved out on her own several hours away. I absolutely LOVE that I can find things for them on Amazon, have them directly shipped with no hassle, and get notified by text when they are delivered. I have always had nothing but the best with Amazon. Not only that, but I try to shop at stores who utilize limited packaging materials, and Amazon is one the few places that ships its items in just the right amount of packaging to protect the item, yet not go overboard. As far as this purchase, it arrived quickly and intact right on time, and my son is kicking it on his downtime with some super fun action thriller entertainment. Thanks, Amazon. You're amazing!
1616550414|5.0|This is a great book to get for any Zelda fan lovers out there. It gives you the newest to the oldest zelda game history, along with drawing artwork, concept art and final images, also talks about the cartoon show they made a long time ago. Love having this book in my room to read and look at, I recommend this any zelda fan :)
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|What made this story stand out was the understanding of what drove each character to act the way they did. They had back stories that showed the reader why they thought and acted the way they did. Also the dialogue between characters was revealing as well as entertaining.Unlike some Historical Romances where the reader is only given a sketchy feel for the characters and are TOLD about them rather than SHOWN,this story delivers.It was an emotional and satisfying ride. Having read the book that came before it made it even more enjoyable.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|The story of a girl, that doesn't quite fit in, going to college when she REALLY doesn't want to. She's given a choice: 1 semester TRYING her best to fit in at something and she can quit school and her parental unit will pay for a move to her preferred location. She joins the all-girl acapella group and spins their world upside down, challenging their leader.<br /><br />Awesome singing. The jokes will be 1 liners that you will quote for years (honestly, they could become Jeopardy questions, they are gonna be so familiar). And some killer songs. Might as just get the soundtrack while you're at it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game has exceptionally good graphics and has a fun idea to it. Very much like Mario Cart, thisbgame is great to play when you are bored and I reccomend it
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Fantastic APP. for those that are in the communications and IT fields. Makes it easy to find the appropriate WIFI broadcast channel for your your wireless router.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should get it or your strange!!!!! GET IT!! It's just like temple run so fans of temple run. . . This is ur thing
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It's different every time we play it because the board is created at random.  It has a nice mixture of strategy and chance, with opponent strategies messing up plans. Best of all, every plays until someone wins.  There is no &#34;first one out, watch everyone else play for a couple more hours.&#34;  Some games are fast and some are slow, but it's simply delightful family fun.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|My cousin got me and my wife to Watch 1 episode now where hooked and own them all we didn't even like zombies
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I don't know why i didn't see this when it came out, it is an excellent movie, and I will probably see it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so fun to play I play all day fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show! Love being able to watch it without having cable tv but...sure wish I could have used my adapter and watched it on a bigger screen!
B00340LM8C|5.0|Although an old movie, this one is still outstanding!  Not many movies today can beat the acting of these two &#34;artists&#34;!  Excellent movie for all ages!  The plot and suspense were captivating!  So refreshing to find a movie that is &#34;clean&#34; and fun to watch!!
B002S45V32|4.0|If you grew up in this era, this movie has to be on your must see, mist have list. I just watched it again for the first time in years and I sort of remembered the movie as originally having a better dialog and that maybe the acting was a little bit better. Its not quite the par of &#34;The Breakfast Club&#34; or &#34;16 Candles&#34; or &#34;St Elmo's Fire&#34; but if you enjoyed any of those movies, you will enjoy this one. However, it makes me wonder, Why did some of these actors disappear for so many years. Like Andrew McCarthy and Molly Ringwald who I feel did a very good job of acting in each of her movies. I also didnt remember how annoying the character Ducky really was. He's like an annoying loser and yet almost seems like someone Johnny Deep may have look to for his quirky styleing cues and attire. Or, maybe if Johnny Deep would have played the part, it would have been a better movie.
B007KOMTUI|1.0|The dvds include a whiskey commercial.  I was unable to get the dvds to play other than the whiskey ad.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I kept hearing people rave about this series and decided it was time to try it out.  This story will grab your interest immediately and make you anxious for the next episode.  I'm hooked and now watching series 2..
B003K16P3M|5.0|absolutely loved it the book never stayed the same long and it was hard to predict what would come next but not enough that it would catch me by suprise
B005OK721G|5.0|Zoe Saldana is a wonderful actress. This movie is so intriguing. I never watch a movie a second time but I seen this already 3 times so far. This movie will not want to make you leave your seat. If you haven't seen it than what are you waiting for?
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Tron: Legacy is an extraordinary film with cutting-edge visuals, an upbeat and eerie soundtrack, excellent direction, believable acting, and a compelling plot. Overall it's definitely a winner and worth repeat viewings. It's a classic and a favorite in my home. Also, this film seems to break genres and boundaries, since my girly girl loves it as well as my more rough and tumble little one. I haven't watched the 3D version but did buy that edition for the extras.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|This game takes a long time to play/advance.  I kept getting messages on my Kindle so I deleted the game.  Typical app - if you want to spend money to buy things in the game,  you can advance faster.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|This first film in the Harry Potter series is a classic. It has the feel of a complete, standalone film, despite the many sequels in the complete series. Excellent for kids of all ages (and some adults too).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|both my son and I both love this game. hes 3 and loves this game, some games are really easy for him to play and others it takes some time.
B000YPUFA6|5.0|I count this as one of my all-time favorite zombie/post-apocalyptic thrillers, whether in the Resident Evil series or not. Milla Jovovick plays a strange character this time, having become a clone of her earlier self, and unfortunately the subsequent films in the series do not equal the quality of this story, it's direction, or it's acting. While the two (or more?) films to follow this one might be worth a viewing, they are not going to be considered to have met the par set by Extinction. In addition to furthering the R-E story, which is sketchy at best anyway, what really stands out is the vast scope of the scenary, and an especially moving scene of a Las Vegas wasteland. I might also recommend playing Fallout: Las Vegas for inspiration after watching this film.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|The rating is mainly low because this movie was just terrible. I guess I'm in love with John Carpenter's version fom 1982 even though that's not even the real original. The original is called \\"The Thing From Another World\\" (1951). I think the special effects were very scary and pretty well done but the actors were not good at all and they didn't give us enough time to get to know the characters and care if they died. This is just my opinion though so you may really like it especially if you haven't seen John Carpenter's version with great actor Kurt Russell. But if you give this your time and haven't seen John Carpenter's version then please check that one out because you'll be glad you did.
B000EZ7ZZE|3.0|This is a good zombie film, plain and simple. The Resident Evil content is really irrelevant. But, beware, some of the scenes are SO BAD that they'll make you groan (like the motorcycle jumping into the middle of the church and then blowing up--so stupid it'll make you wonder if it meant to be funny). Overall, it's a video game film, based on a zombie video game. You just can't have too many expectations. It's fun to watch M-J do her thing, not much more you can say because there is no plot.
B0068RHSZO|5.0|This movie is really great but please don't ruin it for yourself by watching the trailer for this because they give away half the story in it and that will just ruin it for you. I'm not going to say much about this so I myself don't give too much away but this movie isn't a horror movie exactly and it's not very gory. So if you're looking for a horror movie then you might be disappointed but you should still give it a chance because it has a few twists in it that surprise you. Also if you are a person who wants to watch a scary movie but can't handle something too scary then this is for you because it is one of the more mild thrillers out there.
B001RTCP1A|5.0|This film is an instant classic and will remain timeless because it doesn't get too deep into technology. In other words, it's a great sci-fi story that is not concerned with how things work, just that they do work. And, one problem with that is, sometimes things break. Such was the case with a passenger spacecraft with a marshall and his captive as a pair of those passengers. The ship crashes on a harsh alien planet, so survival is the first order of business. That evolves into a battle for survival. I felt that the script excellently increased the tension in the film by allowing Riddick to escape, and rather than this being a horror flick about a serial killer, that fear is transferred to alien species capable of ripping people apart. Oh, and, the sun goes out every 20 years during a very long eclipse. Riddick is no longer a terrifying serial killer but the only man capable of actually dealing with the aliens.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I love this movie. I got it used and it came in great condition. It is nothing like the first one though. This is the second one in the collection. The order is The Silence of the Lambs (1991), Hannibal (2001), Red Dragon (2002), and Hannibal Rising (2007). There is one before the first one called Manhunter (1986) but I never saw that so I have no idea how that plays a part in the collection. For the most part I like this one the best out of all of them because I like that it focuses more on Hannbal Lecter himself and shows that he can be a good person since he loves Clarice. This is why I also liked the Prequel Hannibal Rising as well which explains how Hannibal Lector became a monster. I also liked Hannibal because I like the actor Anthony Hopkins and he is in this movie much more than he was in The Silence of the Lambs. If you're a fan of the collection then get it but. If are looking for a more murder mystery feel with a freaky killer like The Silence of the Lambs then this is probably not for you.
B000XJ5TOK|4.0|Despite myself, I enjoyed this film. It's got a lot of action, some spooky scenes, some horror. Unfortunately, the special effects have not aged well. They might have been sub-par from the start, but today the wall-crawlers clearly look like old-school video game content embedded into a film--they look so bad it's not even scary. Granted, the film is pretty old now, but this was like 10 years after Jurassic Park, so some criticism is justified. I enjoyed it and can recommend it to zombie horror fans but it hasn't aged well.
B00AJLHUYO|4.0|The ending and the conclusion were weird but it was great otherwise. The story was interesting and draws you in. The whole movie was scary and I almost couldn't handle it. This coming from me means a lot because I am a horror movie freak and nothing usually scares me that bad. This scared me and the only other movie that ever scared me and there are only a few other horror movies that can do that to me so badly that I can't watch them over and over. I think one of them will be the new 2013 Evil Dead movie coming out since I couldn't even handle the &#34;don't skip it&#34; part in the beginning of the one trailer for it on YouTube :( So give it a try if you dare but do not show this to tender old people or children unless you wish to scar them for life...
B0046MOVD0|3.0|I have to groan over every one of the films in the Resident Evil franchise, but I really can't help myself--I LIKE IT ANYWAY. Knowing that something is so bad, and yet continuing to participate in it, isn't that called masochism? I'm no sadist, and the film doesn't deserve these words, but just saying, it's so bad it's good--the acting, the special effects, the PLOT. Oh, the plot is a sadist if there ever was one, and anyone who doesn't turn off the film, but watches it to the end must certainly be a masochist. Oh, dear, I find myself unable to review this film without using those two words, after all. Well, my advice is, know what you're getting into, because it's one giant STINKER!! But sometimes that's okay, because, hey, it's M-J killing zombies.
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|This movie didn't have great actors and it just wasn't as good as the first one. The special effects were great though and it was very scary. The gore was over the top but I like that kind of stuff so it was fine for me. But if you're not into huge amounts of gore than do not see or buy this movie. The Blu Ray was excellent so I enjoyed seeing it in this quality.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazon allows immediate video streaming of Season 3. This show is just great and I'm enjoying every moment! Amazon makes it seamless and the pricing is fair.
0307700879|5.0|The English Patient is a must-read for those curious about what divides us, draws us close, and drives us to the brink.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I admit I got this book because of the Oscar buzz. I have not seen the movie and I'm not sure I want to because as great as as Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are it's tough to imagine them doing justice to this touching story of misspent love and loss. Great story, great characters and a plot that is essentially a chick flick for guys. I liked it.<br />.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE this series! British productions are always so well done and I enjoyed this very much. It is very easy to get involved with the characters, and the historical accounts are great, as well.
B00514HDNW|4.0|This was an amazing book with quite an odd ending. I guess not all books can have a happy ending though.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|I first got the free games but soon realized that it was such a fun game we had to get the full version! I hardly ever spend money on games but this one was worth it.  Fun for me and for my kids (ages 7 to 16)  to play on the Kindle. Very happy with the purchase.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is definitely addictive! a lot of fun to play. my only issue is that sometimes it responds too slowly to my finger swipes and then I go splat against a tree. but overall, highly recommended. it dethroned angry birds as my current favorite.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I chuckled through this whole movie. Meryl Streep is great.  It was fun to watch and listen to &#34;their&#34; every day reasoning for life.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|If you don't read Lucretius, this book will tell you everything you need to know about him, his epic poem, and the on-going campaign to keep people uninformed. Greenblatt is engaging, funny, ironic, and probably brilliant.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Nothing better than getting Bin Laden.  A little dragged out.  Water boarding at it's best.  Intense and really dark and the action was about 30.
B007V65R54|5.0|Highly recommend. I gave a copy to a former colleague whose quantitative analysis of fire and weather data has lead to some predictive skill in a field that would love to have a final, definitive technique for assessing risk, even if that is not possible. Foxes and hedgehogs, indeed.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This was an excellent and entertaining movie.  Great surfing shots.  Chase your dreams no matter what.  Got try this someday.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I always like a deal and this is a great one.  You do not need to worry that the story isn't good just because the book is free.  It is a very cute story that brings a smile to your face.  The theme is not a new one but is done in a way that feels fresh.  The heroine wakes up with a hangover and can not remember anything from the previous evening.  The hero has all of his memory and can not believe that the girl he feel in love with can not remember too.  He goes on a mission to convince her that everything they shared was real even if she can't remember it.  Very cute and well worth the price
B005I4JG80|5.0|I am only halfway through, but it contains great ideas on raising children and helping a new mom keep things in perspective.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|What a gifted musician - love all his music, and I'm a senior who never heard of him until now.
B004LWZW42|2.0|Wanted to watch this to understand how X-Men began.  Acting not that great and story line slow.  I think it could have been better.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I enjoy the acting in this series.  There are many characters with recurring roles.  Two of them I don't enjoy watching:  a callow young male attorney and a shrill older female attorney/partner.  For the most part, this is a better than average show with good moral questions that are posed and not always answered with each episode.  I enjoy shows that allow me to think for myself, and this show does challenge the viewer.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Funny movie and crude at times.  I like Cameron Diaz.  At first she was a bad teacher but in the end she was pretty cool.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was hard to put down and full of &#34;aha&#34; moments and surprises. It kept my interest and I couldn't wait to see what happened next. However, when I finally did get to the end, I was very disappointed. Terrible ending. A lot of build up and then a big letdown.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Iron Man fan and a Robert Downey Jr fan as well!  I am looking forward to watching Iron Man three!
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I'm not going to tell you about the book except to say that none of us in my book club<br />could put it down.  We loved it. It's a light and fun read. A title that you want to<br />bring with you when you travel because you have time to go through it without too much<br />interruption.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|Got this because I am a fan of Matthew McConahey.  Pretty much portrayed how the legal system works... money talks!
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Works great on my kindle fire<br /> Timer features are great. Some sounds are quite odd though.Love the jingle bells I downloaded for free.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  A good family one!  Interesting that it is based on a true story which makes you love the dog even more.
0385349947|5.0|Sandberg shares her experiences and her successful journey while providing genuine advice to women. Her writing style is personal and she manages to throw in statistics to support her theories.  Books about women in leadership are hard to come by and this was well worth the buy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fast easy read with a couple of interesting turns. A book that I would definitely share if I had a hard copy.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it. Hope movie stays true to book. Finished it in two days. Pictured Bradley Cooper while reading! Recommend for anyone
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyed this book...read them all...loved that I was just a click away from ordering...didn't have to go to the book store...thanks for convenience...always!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game everything seems so real and its great for little kids I recommend this game !! !!<br />free download!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed this book...read them all...loved that I was just a click away from ordering...didn't have to go to the book store...thanks for convenience...always!
0805047905|5.0|I grew up with this book, and it was the first book I &#34;read&#34; to my classmates in kindergarten.  I can foresee reading this o my child a lot in the future:)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed this book...read them all...loved that I was just a click away from ordering...didn't have to go to the book store...thanks for convenience...always!
B000JLTRIG|5.0|love this series of movies. Keeps me intertained ya. The whole magic thing is cool good vs evil. Girly show I love it
B00B69UQEO|2.0|Overpriced !!I can probably listen to 3 songs out of 17 , really sad cd , this guys are done , at least on this round , disappointing , sorry !
B0053O89XI|5.0|Love the big bang theory, its so cool.. and this combo includes DVD+ bluray so its suitable for people that dont have bluray
B009AMANBA|5.0|Director Spielberg based the movie LINCOLN partly on historian Doris Kearns Goodwin's TEAM of RIVALS which in turn covers the forever life changing historical and career events during the final four months in Lincoln's life. Let the history buff reviewers argue and try to separate fact from fiction in this piece of work but don't allow them to dissuade you from watching and even enjoying the stellar performances by one and all in LINCOLN.  IMO, this film and all involved earned every award nominated for and given.  This is a film that I will gladly add to my collection and see again and again.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I cannot even begin to imagine why someone would waste their time in producing this movie. The theme was totally dumb and a waste of my time.
B0040I09RM|4.0|good season. was intresting to watch, good story line. i think you will enjoy watching the first season and the other seasons too.
B00821OX98|4.0|Interesting premise and reasonably written.  Some lookers in the cast but all the problems of some ???? housewives drama.. Great commercial for considering thinking  about arming yourself and having plenty of ammo on hand.  Crossbow or better maybe.
0756405890|5.0|This book is a welcome addition to my fantasy collection. It similarly serves as a welcome voice to the genre. It is early to say but I would equate Rothfuss with authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, George R.R. Martin, Ursula Le Guinn, etc. The prose is fantastic and the dialogue engrossing. While not much of the world has yet to be explained, I look forward to the second and third books as a source of expanding upon this world. The whole centrality of the bard I also find to be an interesting take. While fantasy focusing on bards and bardic tales is in no way new, Rothfuss' presentation is perhaps the best I have ever read.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Oh my gosh! I even hated to stop playing to write this! The older I've gotten, the more I usually stay away from timed games as I get panicky and I'm afraid I'll have a heart attack! I'm not really adept at video games, period, but this one is so much fun!! It even seems to cheat on your behalf! After losing a level a few times, I have my suspicions that it gives a bit easier chance layout so you don't get too frustrated and throw your kindle or cry pathetically over being such a crummy game player!<br /><br />Seriously, I'm starting to feel like I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome! Don't say you weren't warned! Very, very fun and addictive game for anyone, even the lowest of the low game players! (You know who you are!) I love it!
0062200909|5.0|As a long standing reader of Tolkien and a fan of the movie franchise that P Jackson has brought about, I am delighted with this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Okay, I am rating my aps that I use daily.  This one is good, it helps keep up to date with my business and personal friends.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|this is a game anyone can play you know like when you in the bank or in the airport and you have nothing to do this will be nice ,
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Okay, I am rating my aps that I use daily.  This one is good, it helps keep up to date with my business and personal friends.
B008MEM24S|3.0|i like this game for the kids this is a good game to get for them like if you going out and you need them to be nice kids this is it ,
B008VBYN80|5.0|Not a bad game, kept us entertained for a while, pretty interactive.  A bit too easy for clicks to dominate this game, but still not bad.
B005HSL626|3.0|this game was ok i will say it more for kids not big people children i didn't like so much
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Okay, I am rating my aps that I use daily.  This one is good, it helps keep up to date with my business and personal friends.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game a lot. I am still trying to figure out all that I can do with the pieces that I earn during game play, but it is fun and people's comments are hilarious.  It is definitely a time killer if you are stuck waiting somewhere.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Amazing well told story. The buildup is so intense; I can't imagine living through that. It is so important to re-visit history, so we can learn from it. Loved it!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I think Sheryl Sandberg's book was unfairly criticized in the press, primarily by people who obviously didn't read the entire book or just quickly skimmed it. I was able to read the whole thing in a single sitting, so this would easily make a good Saturday or Sunday read. <br /><br />She points out how men who contribute to their families are often criticized and marginalized both by their bosses and by society. They are more likely to be harshly penalized for taking extended family medical leave to deal with a sick child or parent, both in terms of salary and promotion opportunities. <br /><br />Perhaps one of the biggest take away from this book is not only how many women sabotage their own careers, but also that we need to do more to value and honor men's family contributions by promoting paternity leave etc. Men don't have it all either, and we should do more to promote active fatherhood as well. This will start to level the playing field for women in the workforce as well. <br /><br />Since Sandberg has done so much hiring and firing in her career, I wish she would write a book about landing a job. There are tid bits in this book that I thought were really insightful, and obviously she knows enough to write an entire book just on that. Given today's economy, that would be really helpful to a lot of people.
B00BN4URSW|4.0|Good show, not a big Cruise fan, but like it anyway. Helluva shot, even if it is only a movie.
030758836X|2.0|I thought the author focused more on trying to keep the reader intrigued about the surprise plot twists than on developing the characters.  Besides the twists, the plot itself seemed one-dimenstional.  In the end I didn't feel like I knew any of the characters.  It is not one of those books you go back to read twice.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Second time, caught a lot more than the first. This is a wild trip movie. Definite recommendation. You won't be sorry.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game for all ages.  The levels vary in difficulty and require you to plan your actions.  Each time I finish one, I replay to see if I can do better next time.  Great for long car trips too!
044024630X|4.0|Some serial characters don't hold up well after repeated exposure. They become a bit stale, too predictable, but Jack Reacher? Never! Lee Child is way too good at this game. He sets the hook then leaves little bits here and there, some obvious, some not so, but all keep the reader saying \\"OK, just a few more pages,\\" then a few more, and a few more. The narrative is first person Reacher, and strictly linear. There are subplots galore, but the straightforward style makes them easy to follow.<br />At the outset, Reacher enters the Pentagon with a target on his back. He's in uniform, an MP major, but scruffy, needs a haircut and a shave. He's posted to Kelam, a Ranger Base south of Tennessee where a young woman has been murdered, her throat slashed in military fashion. If this turns out to be a soldier killing, things will go very bad for the base and its in habitants. Reacher has an opposite number on the inside, Major Munro, also MP, but Reacher works, as always, on the outside.<br />He contacts the local sheriff, a stunning young woman who complicates his job by spotting him immediately. She's done similar work with the Marine Corps, but has made little progress solving the murder.<br />Reacher does his work in his own way, as usual, playing within the rules but just barely. I'll leave the rest of the plot description to the reader. No need to spoil someone else's fun.<br />In the end, as usual, Reacher leaves town, mission accomplished, a beautiful sheriff pining for him but knowing he's not a man who stays in one place for any longer than necessary.<br />Vintage Child, a master of his craft.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like this &#34;no fuss&#34; clock.  I can take it anywhere and it is easy to read, and has several settings for alarms that are easy to set.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I don't normally read books more than once but this is a story I will certainly revisit. This book takes you to a circus like none other. The characters are well developed and don't disappoint. It would be awesome if the circus was real.
B00006F1IJ|5.0|If you like mellow music... you'll love this CD! I freguently listen to this CD while driving, although it tends to lull me to sleep. LOL
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Even after three books, the author still managed to keep you enthrall end. Fantastic continuation of the series. Will read again
B002W1UEW4|3.0|I am finally watching this movie because I have considered going and seeing the second one. I am thrilled to say that it had exactly what I wanted from an action flick. There were plenty of explosions, somewhat cheesy villains, a little romance, some humor and some memorable moments (for those who haven't watched, no spoilers).<br /><br />There was no horrifically bad acting and that's what saved this movie, I believe, from being totally crappy.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The TV show has been masterfully done, right down to the dialog that each character has.  The locations that they film at are stunning and what special effects they use are amazing (wildfire...enough said).  The casting is excellent and I must say that one of the cast members (who plays a certain Stark daughter) even makes their character more enjoyable than she is in the books.  While the show does leave out some things, one does have to keep in mind that it is a TV show.  They can’t include the same level of insane detail that the books do but that said I am overall pleased with how well done the show is and can not wait until I am able to see season 3.<br /><br />If you're interested in what was left out from the show, go buy the books (which you'll likely finish before GRRM finishes book 6) as they are worth reading.  Keep in mind that they do have an insane level of detail and are not short books.  If you're looking for some epic fantasy to read at work while on lunch, this is it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this book.I read the Fall of Giants, the first of this trilogy, and I am anxious for the third to be published. Ken Follett is a wonderful author. I have read several of his books and have never been disappointed
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Either you are starting to run or a seasoned veteran this book will change the way you think about running!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is easy to play and is VERY addictive.  It is difficult to only play just one game.  Enjoy!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It was suspenseful, had some humor, and amazing finale scene, but I wish there was a little more character development.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|The workouts are 10 to 30 minutes, and each exercise is 30 seconds. I could feel the effects, but did not feel so sore that I didn't want to do them again.  I like the variety of exercises provided, and they very every time I do them so it's not the same boring routine every time.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|This stand would be perfect for a laptop that has a flush battery; however, the battery I use for my Dell laptop is  9-cell Lithium Ion Primary Battery which has a lip on it tilting the laptop slightly.  Since the laptop was not 100% flush with the stand it kept slipping resulting in the return of the product.  If I still used my 6-cell battery the stand would be perfect and would have received a 5 star rating.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Bought this for my daughter and it never downloaded. I can't find it anywhere in my kindle even though it says its already purchased. So frustrating!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Suspenseful and amazing storytelling! Highly recommend. Excellent actors made this show great. I absolutely loved it.<br />Can't wait for next season.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Brings you right back to situations you faced while growing up. Everyone has a story that thy can compare to this book. Great read
B006TLFPKO|5.0|beautiful bella and the wedding and the baby and the story continues to grow and the story continues to draw you in, and make you look forward to the next
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|If you like these type of games, buy this one. I am not yet done but I'm enjoying it completely. Longer than most, good story, and no issues loading on my kindle fire. G5 is on a roll, keep them coming, I'll keep playing!!!  Kudos to you. :)
B00BF11STU|2.0|It moved so slowly i fell asleep halfway through. Personally friends with Gary Berntsen author of no 1 best seller jawbreaker the hunt for bin-laden. We had him once but let him go. Personally i would've wanted an explanation as to why we did that and then the final outcome. The story made sure and drive home a point that this female agent that had up to that point did nothing. Singlehanded she had them make the decision to make the move to kill him! I don't by it and it diminishes the hard work countless others contributed to the final out come of this operation. But in todays liberal hollywood and the country's politicly correctness attitude they made it that way. It showed in the box office take
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love this game. Been playing for hours on my KF 8.9. Works fine. No problems at all. Rock Stomper works best for me,but save your last upgrade til the end whatever car you use. Coin doubler well worth the $1.99. Good luck.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Like the original Star Trek tv series, captivating personalities and aligned and committed to their feelings. Very fun and inspiring.
B004B63M1S|3.0|While the movie was over the top with special effects the ending to the dual at the end of the money was disappointing.  I thought Segal could have been more creative.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|As soon as you start you all ready have a guy and you rellay do not have to pay money to get coins. When you get good at it you just keep going on and on and when you finally die you look at the screen and you see that you just got 600 coins. I hope u get this game.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|It was a really good flick.  It had deleted scenes and after watching them it was obvious why they were removed.  Otherwise, it was a great story.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I like the series overall but one entire episode I had to watch the buffering symbol turn in the middle of the screen.
0062238868|5.0|Read it and pass it on to another person.  story of a great american.  maybe a look into the lives of those who fight for us that we all need to know.
0525953728|5.0|This was an easy to read and suspenseful book.  I would recommend this book for anyone interested in military history.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. I laughed and cried and had a very hard time putting it down.
B003E48AYC|5.0|This is a great product. It surpassed my expectations. It is the premeir product of it's class. I would buy it over and over!!!!
B000XUBC5E|4.0|Lots of twists and turns like you expect from Harlan Coben.  Sometimes a little tricky to follow all the twists..
B0042JTDXK|5.0|This is a great product. It surpassed my expectations. It is the premeir product of it's class. I would buy it over and over!!!!
B00BF11STU|4.0|The first 45 min. to an hour of the movie was hard to understand or hear.  The sound was kind of garbaled.  I still liked the movie though.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is a great product. It surpassed my expectations. It is the premeir product of it's class. I would buy it over and over!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|good app I love it so much it has good. qualities. and is crash. dahlia. monkey severely amazing dog books
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a great product. It surpassed my expectations. It is the premeir product of it's class. I would buy it over and over!!!!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|The book was pretty good, following the line of the previous ones.<br />The thing that keeps bothering me is this: we all know alex is not dead ok, so we are expecting a final book full of romance, but wait a second what is a young adult hit without a love triangule, so here we are in this love battle wondering what is going to happen next, second; I mean come on what kind of grand final is that, I don't want to spoil anything so I'm not saying more, but I expected way more.<br />Conclusion, if you are a fan of this series you must read this book, but prepare to be a little disappointed.
1451627289|5.0|This is a great product. It surpassed my expectations. It is the premeir product of it's class. I would buy it over and over!!!!
0786838655|5.0|This book was a gift to a teen and she really loves this author so, sense she is a reader -yea- I had to find this book for her
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Makes me proud to be an American, still the greatest country in the world and especially proud of the men.
B0029LHX1W|5.0|This was given as a gift and the person loved it so much the passed it around to everyone great condition
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Good show if you have nothing else to watch. The acting is good outside of the lady half of the partners in the firm
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I just downloaded this game a few hours a go and became addicted to it but.In the next update you guys should add the prehistoric king of the ocean megalodon,and you guys should also make like a dinosaur version or something
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Another indication of the poor quality of movies from Hollywood. To think that the Academy considers this a Best Picture.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I didn't think this would be my kind of show, I'm more the zombie/sci fi/action fan, but I thought I'd give it a go because of all the popularity. Well, I've been hooked from the first ten minutes.  Totally engaging story lines and incredible acting make me want to take a day off work and just episode binge all day.  I highly recommend this series.
B00493E1GI|5.0|Only a woman can relate...or a sensitive man. Julia Roberts infectious smile<br />keeps you grinning through the entire movie. I don't think the world is as<br />safe today to travel alone as she did in this movie but it's a fun fantasy for<br />us home bodies to escape into.
B000002W9Q|5.0|lots of good songs, a decent variety of genres...from a decent movie.  Sorry Amazon, I can't think of 8 more words to add to make this review &#34;valuable&#34; according to your criteria...i really wish you would reconsider you're minimum word policy, because sometimes less is more!
B00ADLCC9I|5.0|I am very satisfied with this device. While I wouldn't recommend forking over $300 dollars for it, it is well worth the retail price of $169-$179. I bought this device mainly for emulation of classic consoles, and I'm happy to say that all of the emulators I've tried run flawlessly on its modest hardware. Also, it makes a great portable media player with the addition of the Micro SD slot and Mini HDMI out. The physical controls take some getting used to, but are very accurate and responsive. Despite other reviewers opinions, I don't think the battery life is all that bad, definitely on par with a DS or a PSP. If you lower the brightness setting a little as I did, you can expect to get 4-5 hours of battery life. In general I definitely recommend this device, but I would definitely wait for the price to drop back to normal.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For seven days Dr. Alexander was in a coma, brought on by e.coli meningitis.  The account that he describes lends credence to  consciousness existing apart from the human brain [see neocortex].  The book is a fast read, one that you will ask for more when it concludes.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm new to Downton and missed the beginning. After catching up, I need season three! How can I get this?
B005K01VZS|5.0|Enjoy his writing style--Am from Detroit area and can identify with with the locale. Loved it.  I really enjoyed Have a Little Faith.. Henry's life was inspirational!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Can not wait for Season 3.  Best Show We have seen in a long time.  would very much recommend.  More please!
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|Zimmer fans will love this, whether or not you've seen the show. If you have, and it's been a while, it will bring you right back to another time and space. \\"Forgiven\\" and \\"Passacaglia\\" on their own are worth the price of admission.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Our family can not wait for Season 3.... We watched Season 1 and 2 in 2 weekends.  Love the cast, scenery, costumes.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I loved this movie as a child when it first came out, and my feeling haven't changed over the decades.  The meshing of live action and animation--a first for Disney, if I am not mistaken--is seamless, which is quite an accomplishment.  The music is gorgeous, the dancing lively and fun.  They just don't get any better than this!
B0089XH38M|5.0|Easy installation.  Works well, no problems to date (it has been installed about a month).  It is an easy download and simple to set-up.  For several yearsI had AVG installed on my desktop and it was very effective.  Now running Windows 8 and it has it's own virus protection.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I do not know how to use it. Since I got it I was never able to review. I don't know what it is
1400069807|5.0|It is affirming and frightening to have hould my long held beliefs concerned about the conspiracy to sell processed foods under the guise of healthy. Everyone should read this book.
034580404X|4.0|I gave this book as a gift to a family member, as a birthday present. She is still reading it,
B0094K1WZE|5.0|It was fast and furious with lots of twist. Just what you would expect from this franchise. Like to see it again.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|This movie put me asleep in the beginning...started to pick up towards the end. Good movie for the kids to see because it has a message if you really pay attention...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it if you Levant for a while it gives you more gems I love it love love. love love love so so soso sos osos os osos osos os osososos ososos osososo much
0307719219|5.0|This is one of the best nonfiction books I have read in quite some time.  I don't have much to add to the other reviews, but I will say that everyone should read this.  It puts much of our history and current events (and explains why they're related) into context.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|A very well-written and intriguing book.  The recipes were fun and easy, as well. You too will soon be running.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great way to take a break for a few minutes every couple of hours in between other work.  The horse images and movements are very realistic. The mini games are fun and the competitions and goals provide an ongoing challenge. The pop up ads are a bit annoying. I haven't used real money to buy more play coins but I would be willing to pay a small fee to play ad free!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got it and it was very fun.I think I opened a server I built a cozy cottage from a video I added more stuff to it I got an extra app to spawn in blocks called pocketinvediter to get the blocks.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I actually bought the deluxe edition on iTunes, which I normally don't do, that is how much I love OneRepublic. This cd is by far their best that they have done. I loved when they released Feel Again and If I Lose Myself early and they are both a great feeling for the rest of the album. Out of all of the 17 songs (deluxe), one of my favorites (like picking a favorite book or child) is Something I Need. The whole album is one of the best things I have ever heard. It always takes them awhile to release new cd's, but if this is the result, I guess that is okay. Great job guys!!
B0094K1K8I|3.0|I usually like this type of movie, but this was very slow moving and not very eventful until the end.  The actors did a good job and the visual quality was good, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.  I had seen advertisements and trailers for it and watched it because I thought it would be a good movie.
B000N6UERK|5.0|This is a super flick!  Great to watch with sufficient other.  As always Denzel Washington is superb!  The movie is extremely well crafted, smooth to the finish.  BUY IT!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Roberto of of subway suffers please note me lol l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I have to wait before reading another book so I can fully absorb the intensity my brain has just taken in. Wiping years from my eyes as I go to sleep. Great story telling. Thank you for the ride....
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Really a 3.5 star show but that wasnt an option. Not terrible to watch if theirs nothing else on. Give it a try.
B001LOPYHI|5.0|It is a huge reference about what computers might come to be. It is a superb story of the men against the machine and the discovery of our true nature.
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|If you like classic rock, you'll like this. Easy to download and easy to transfer to my music player or burn to a disc.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat, to the very end! Please keep it coming! You provide a great service!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is thee greatest game ever<br />I never played a game so fun yahoooo<br />I love this game its awesome but I wish you could make your own charter that would make it more awesome
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|It is a wonderful sci-fi show, which you do not have to have watched the classic show to understand. Everyone could find something to like about Dr. Who. It is full of suspense and adventure. Can be a touch violent/scary, but not gory.
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|I know the Oscars love Pixar, but honestly this was the better movie of the two.  Brave was good, but Wreck-it Ralph was truly better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is tough but so fun. Everyone from kids to adults in my family play. 5 stars in my book!
0143034901|5.0|One of the best novels I've ever read full of mystery, heartbreak, tenderness and a little bit of the paranormal.  Carlos R.Z. is a wonderful writer!  There were many characters, but the writer made it easy to figure out who was who.  Sometimes novelists throw in a bunch of characters and it's hard to keep track.  I never had to go back to reacquaint myself with any person.  Was particularly smitten with the description of the moody abandoned house in which much of the story took place at various times from the early l900's through the end of the tale.  Also loved Daniel's sidekick, Thermin.  Talk about a true blue friend!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|this game is really cool and has good gameplay but keeps on restarting my progress. It happened to me about 3-4 times. I wonder if its just my kindle fire or it just happens to everyone. Get it if you want to risk it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham never disappoints this book is Grisham at his consistent best, I buy him for my Kindle Fire it's so easy to download and at a cheaper cost than buying a hardback.
0547848412|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I've read it twice now, once before seeing the movie once after. Rented the movie through my Wii with amazon as well.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Vintage Clancy I thought his last few books were a little pot boiled bu this one is up to speed.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love the beat and sound of this band.  It is somewhere a cross between country and rock and blue grass.
B0090O07S2|5.0|As a long-time Doors devotee and previous owner of the first laser disc version of this concert I postponed purchasing this again to hold off a potential contrived burn.(own all their Lps) What a surprise: Jim and the band are re-born young and on top of the rock world here once more. When I read that they re-stored the microphones carefully, restoring at least 2 songs I had to get it. \\"Hello, I love you,\\" and \\"Unknown Soldier\\" both come alive with greater power than other live versions. No one could touch the band, and nobody could top Jim Morrison's theatricality in full, improvisational force. Every reason for taking a literature class, especially poetry gets full credence. You are transfixed as Jim prowls his improvisational licks without missing a beat, seamlessly moving into another killer song like \\"Unknown Soldier,\\" which surpasses the excitement of the black-and-white European tour version. The Bonus Features make it more than collectible featuring: a wonderful final interview with the surviving members recollecting that time and their place in it, just a wonderful thanks to their fans. Live cuts from The Smothers Brothers Show, the Jonathan Winters Show, make this concert a wonderful Thank You package. The Doors deserve a wonderful ovation for this captured moment at The Bowl.
B008Y768XO|4.0|Great movie tearjerker. Places in it that just drag on. Becomes redundant at times. Even my dog loved it. Got pics of her intently watching
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I found this particular book to be difficult to get into. It may have been more the subject matter because I found the details themselves to be impeccable. I enjoy the John Locke books, so I thought I would also enjoy this one. The overall story did have some very nice twists and surprises. If you enjoy graphic action, you will most likely enjoy this book.
030758836X|5.0|What a twisted tale that was woven in this book.  The style in which it was written using the diary entries of each character made for an interesting read.
B008ROG6E0|5.0|A little shmultzy but makes some very nice points about religion, government, etc. 7 more words required? OK. OK. I'll type more words.
0374533571|5.0|Great book!  What an insightful delivery of the lives of those suffering with bipolar disorders.  It was a great read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best Grisham novels in a few years.  Loved it and couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This is a really cool game. I am really enjoying and so does my grandaughters they really get into the game.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Easy and interesting read. Very spicy and surprising at times. A great way to spice things up with your significant other.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Exactly what I ordered and received it quickly! Is long enough to put anywhere in the house and i can plug it into other bases to use (like in the car).  Excellent.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie not worth the price to rent via Amazon, pay $1 that's really all this movie is worth. The previews I saw on TV made this movie APPEAR to be funny & it was more boring than funny.
B003L77FYS|4.0|Absolutely find this show hilarious.  Can't wait to see more seasons come about.  I am totally hooked and find myself watching during my lunch hour at work - ssshhhhh
B00846REIS|5.0|If you like 50 Shades, you are going to love this book!  This book is full of surprises and has a great story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Personally, I think that this is one of the best games I have ever played and got addicted to, no joke! I would recommend it for people of all ages. I mean it's just FRICKIN EPIC!!! Buy the game, you'll be glad you did.
1439102813|5.0|As you step into the world of Alzheimers - it is frightening and makes you question so many &#34;take ffor granted&#34;<br />times and situations .
B00881VLCE|5.0|Play this a lot. Would recommend to anyone who likes jigsaw puzzles! And its free! Get now and start building.
1616550414|5.0|I Absolutely love every page. It shipped with no problems and came on time and with no dings. Would do it all again if I had to.
0425263908|5.0|OMG!! I read it several times, and every time is like a first time...I love Sylvia's style and think that E.L. James and \\"50 Shades\\" have a lot to learn. Thank you Sylvia!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't believe it.  Just CAN'T. Amazing book (yes I am fully aware I am late)! Great ending so there is no question what I have to do next. . .BUY THE 3 rd BOOK NOW!!
0425263916|5.0|Great book, can't wait for next to come!<br />Still, what was Gideon looking at Eva's apartment at the end of a 1st book?!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|From start to finish the premise is plauseable and the situation, though unlikely, seems to be quite possible. The story is a modern day Robinson Crusoe story.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I believe that this book was well written. The story line of it is definitely on point. Also it is spectacular in leaving you in suspense for the next book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was okay, the story drug out for awhile, well written but difficult getting through it.  Some might find it more interesting than I did.
0062073486|5.0|Why i love Christie's books? because they are colorful. I once had a short argument with my dad, who claimed that her books are childish. Maybe. could be. But they are colorful. They are vivid and alive. He said that it's not the books, but my vivid imagination, but then i have never had the same feeling reading any other detective story.<br />Christie is different. and this is one of my most favorite books of her. I am a very big Poirot fan and missed him in this one, but the story was great. Love it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, it was easy to read.  The story was continually interesting.  I would recommend this book.
B00B9LNJ9I|1.0|I could not wait to get this CD because I've previously liked everything from Dido.  It started with the usual Dido-ness on No Freedom but quickly went downhill from that point.  Several songs start out nice and then in the middle there is some rap crap going on by a male singer.  Quite awful.  I will be trying to sell this cd soon on ebay.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I rented this on a dvd service that I belong to, and once I watched it again, I knew I wanted to add it to my library. Good price.
B00275EGWY|5.0|The DVD movie for last night really got to me. It was \\"The Hurt Locker\\" and it didn't really have any stars. Don't take that as a negative, as everyone who was in the movie was a star. Very strange movie. It was more like a \\"you-are-there\\" documentary of a small part of the war in Iraq and it seemed ultra-realistic. Amazing! I can understand the Academy Awards. It's a wonder it didn't get more! The movie followed a small force in a Humvee whose task was to disarm bombs. Tense? Oh, yeah! In any  case, they were followed on their day to day tasks as they went through their time until they were relieved by a new crew. The movie took place in a little over a month and it was date stamped as you proceeded. It really wasn't much of a story, but at the same time, it was one of the most powerful stories you might ever see. You get out of it what you read into it. In a lot of ways, that's the best kind of story.<br /><br />Okay, let me give a little of my own personal background. I've never been in the military and I've never even been close to combat of any kind. So, how am I to judge a combat film? Well, I'm not judging it. What I'm saying is that this can be a very powerful movie, if you allow it to be. When I got through with the movie, I went to the Amazon Reviews just to see what other people thought of it. I was glad I read the reviews and comments after viewing the movie. Not everyone likes the movie, to say the least. Some think it's awful. Many give it high praise. Well, the reviews, together with their comments, are all over the place, and a lot of them are very thoughtful and well worth reading. This movie has impact! Trust me on that. See for yourself. Whether you like the movie or don't like the movie, it certainly gets things stirred up, more than any movie I've seen in decades. I'm giving it five stars on that basis.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This is how I gather and listen to music on my computer at work, without loading on the office computer. I just call up my Amazon Cloud, and push play. Great.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|love thus campy, creative show. we watch it as a family. even my 9 yr old loves it & it's not too scary for her
B000001DQG|5.0|I won't tell you how old I wasn't when I first bought this album - the day it first hit the store shelves in 1974 - but I loved it then, and I still do!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|My kids got me into Doctor Who and I am in love! I really like Donna and their relationship. He needed someone who would not fall in love with him but would be a friend. I still miss Rose!
B008220C38|5.0|I didn't know how they could make Anna Karenina any different from the ones from the 30\\"s, 40's and 60's - this whole concept is great. I can't say more without giving it away, but watch it and you will see what I mean. Keira Knightly has been great at period films, and she has proved that again.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Me encantaron los discos que vienen. Me encanta esta banda desde que los escuché. Me parece que es un buen relajante y placebo. Lo recomiendo mucho
B0011Z31V8|4.0|Nice assortment of the artist's work. Many classic songs, and many from different films. Very good purchase at a good price.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've heard a lot about Doctor Who and kept meaning to give it a try. I still haven't seen the original series but if it's anything like this one, I need to correct that sometime in the near future. The special effects are pretty bad and every now and again I want to punch one of the protagonists, but it's great, really tight, and the acting is always on the mark. In addition to a compelling, engaging story arc, each episode manages to include elements of intriguing sci-fi not seen often in this format and very much missed and appreciated.
0307341550|1.0|Hated this book!!! i am never one to not finish a book and so so many times I wanted to leave this one. However, grudgingly I finished. The only thing I can say about this book is only read it if you get it out of a garbage can- and even then I would pass it by!! Dont waste your time or money one this!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is something that is amazing. I read it in 2 days. I just couldnt find a stopping point it keeps you rrading to see what happens next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was not sure of this book at first and thought it was a read meant for my 16yr old. However, after the first Chapter I was hooked!!! I could not stop reading this book!! I loved it and all the marvelous twists and turns from beginning to end. Thank you for such a wonderful writing job on such a sad girl/subject. I loved both your main characters!!
1476712042|5.0|Loved it! Can not wait for the next one. I have already pre ordered it. Read it in less than 24 hours. I could not put it down!
B007V65R54|5.0|What a wonderful, thought provoking book. So timely, and right on. I have already recommended it to so many people.
B00992CF6W|4.0|would be 5 stars if it had SOME qualities that the computer version has.Don't get me wrong; this is a great game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I downloaded the Bible on my kindle and am very pleased with the product. Its easy to use, can find scripture quickly, make print larger and make notes. Its  great to always have Bible at my fingertips.
B00BP29SAA|4.0|The only bad review states there is nodirections , which is indeed true but really, my two year old worked out what to do within minutes. It doesn't need directions. Click on the animal and then click again to sit them in the trolley I mean c'mon.<br /><br />The game is great. It has a nice mix of activities as per usual that are fun and educational. The characters are adorable as always. Activities include sorting money, picking the correct items from the shelf, making coffeee , putting bags in animals cars, pick and mix!, jigsaw type game where you unload blocks from the truck, a cart wrangling game and cleaning up the spills. The beauty of these games is kids have to figure it out, use your brain because the game won't tell you what to do. You know, like life.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I downloaded this game on my Kindle and am pleased with the product. Its a fun game to pass a few minutes while waiting for an appointment.
B00756GRUE|5.0|I have had this watch for 8 months and love it.  It keeps great time, works beautifully, and looks awesome.  I am always getting compliments about it.  This watch is very durable I wear it everyday and it gets a lot of abuse but it still looks like the day I bought it.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This is a heartwarming story that is a pleasure to read. You want to keep reading until you find out what happened.
B009KEN87O|5.0|A blast from the past. Lots of fun and it gets challenging as you go. Works great on the Kindle fire HD.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Boring, with very few funny lines.  Can't believe I paid for this crap.  2 hours I'll never get back.  Don't waste your time.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I think the book ended fairly, although i was let down a little bit. I really hoped for more of a Alex and Lena ending. For the people who dont see why Lena chose Alex: think about it, would you pick the person who made you feel love for the first time even after you thought it was absurd, the person that was so in love with you that just the thought of you made him survive the terrible torture of the Crypts, the person who you knew for quiet a while and had history with , or the guy that simply gave you comfort when you needed it?
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was excited to read this book because of all of the buzz surrounding it. To my surprise it's BORING. What a disappointment! It's not at all what I was expecting and not nearly as scandalous as the hype insinuates.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|He teaches his pupil everything he knows--not!  Good JS flick with a lot of thought to it !  A good plot twist at the end!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved it. I do believe it is one of the best books that I have read in a while. The series is very close to it with some differences. I enjoyed the series as well.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|The book was a bit drawn out at times  However the details of the diet program were well set out and believe me when I say, &#34;the diet works&#34; and that was the purpose of the purchase.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|A long waited new CD from Justin. Great songs! Even the new versions of some old songs from other previous albums are fresh and interesting. Justin's voice sounds better than ever.
B005EWDA9M|2.0|Sorry Haruki, not my type of book.  Too boring in too many parts and who cares about everyones life story?  Anyway, only got through book 1 and 2 and not interested in book 3.
B001BANK32|5.0|Somehow, I missed this book when it came out many years ago. I have been going back and reading all of King's novels and this was just on my list.  Had seen the movie many years ago but the movie does not do the book justice. Stephen King has a uniquely detailed way of developing a character and geting inside his reader's head.  Outstanding read. I will never stay at a hotel called the Overlook.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I loved this movie.  It has everything that makes a romance work. You really get to like the people.  No one is perfect, everyone has some flaw but that just makes you feel like you know the characters.<br />In the end, isn't love what really counts?
B0083GQVXI|5.0|Great acting all around in this film.  Some parts are difficult to watch just because of the subject matter, but I think the film was brilliantly done.  Tilda Swinton gives a hauntingly great performance.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Even filming a real story of a real person will not get close to way Denzel Washington acts in this movie.
0688156819|5.0|My husband had got this for me for my birthday this year. I am a huge Tim Burton fan, and had read this before and have been wanting it since. The book was in great condition when it arrived and had the oh so wonderful new book smell. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|absolutely love the game. but absolutely hate the extremely annoying pop up ads. it is an easy time waster if you can get past the annoyance.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The worst movie ever. it changed my mind about the writer. Thyy need to have sex before writing another movie like this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was a intriguing drama that kept me wanting more.  Loved all the characters.  I can not wait for Season 4.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Awesome headset, sound quality perfect, for music and for gaming<br />wireless working pretty well and battery life really long, about 12 hours
B000IZ4R1U|3.0|I chose to watch this as we had just returned from Cambodia and wanted to see how the temple was utilized in the movie- it was not very good re actually showing the ruins and the roots of the trees that are destroying the edifice.  Oh well- I guess it was made around the actress not the story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I'm so addicted to this game. I really hope that another update becomes available soon. Would also be nice to get new characters for less money.
0743298039|5.0|A great tale with characters I became easily invested in. Well written and a great book-club book. I would re-read for sure.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|After seeing and hearing this, I'm surprised it was nominated as a top movie. Very much a sing-song type thing for a chinese movie.
0143039431|5.0|A classic for a reason, engrossing, profoundly human, could not put the book down. Very highly recommended, I also really benefited from learning about the history through this book.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a fun little game. Brings me back to childhood and my Nintendo days. I recommended to my autistic son and he loves it.
B0000549B0|5.0|I can't put into words how much I love this movies. The brilliance,the wisdom, the insight, it's a modern piece that while not Shakespeare, touches on Shakespeare's ability to delve so much into what is to be alive, to be human. We are what dreams are made of.<br /><br />Josephine Hull is said to have given one of the few utterly brilliant, 'perfect' performances on screen (I believe it's been said to be in the top 5 of all time) in Harvey. I agree.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|If you are an 80's kid, you will find this entertaining. It is kind of like Donkey Kong'ish game that takes on a life of its own. I am very happy that Disney is finally making movies that you actually want to watch again.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This documentary was amazing.  Filled with such history behind some of my favorite bands & albums.  Being someone who used to sell these records in a store it was very cool to see and hear the stories behind the final product.
0553573403|5.0|This book is awesome. If there is any fantasy series for adults it's this one. After reading Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings, and the Inheritance Cycle there was a void left in my soul that yearned for a more adult reading level fantasy series to fill my time with, that's when Game of Thrones came into my life. Its reading level is more of an adult or upper college level then these other series, except perhaps Tolkien, which makes it a more engaging and challenging read. Beware though; you need some serious time and attention to devote to this series. The author, George R.R. Martin, has so many characters that you have to keep straight in your head (some with confusingly similar names, i.e. Asha and Osha) that you really want to be in your happy reading place where you can focus and read. If you try to read this on the go or in company your either going to miss something important in the book, or whatever someone next to you is talking to you about because you will be so engrossed in the content. So why should you really read it? The Character development is brave and deep. You sometimes feel you know the characters intimately yet they always are capable of doing something that will surprise you like your own best friend. You will love some of them, then hate them, then love them. You will plead for some to die and mourn for others. GRRM is such an amazing and intricate writer that I would, and have, recommended this book and series to all of my friends in their 20's and up. If I could say anything bad about these books it is that you must be patient with them, extremely patient at times. You may read about a character and end the chapter filled with suspense and then not read about them again for another 100 pages and forget completely what was happening to them. A Game of Thrones for me took about 150 pages into the book to grab my attention fully, but once I was hooked there was no looking back, no regret. And if you allow yourself to be taken by the story you will have the same experience as I did.e story you will have the same experience as I did.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I really enjoy this game. I have a tiny tablet so I xcan not read some of the words in the accomplishment requirements but it is fun driving this island. I like being able to hit stuff.
B00B23O96A|1.0|This should be called stale old sock, This is the worst CD he has ever released in my opinion. Weak songs, vocals and almost no soloing. I think he has finely ran out of gas, his last two CD'S were not much better. I have been a huge fan of his for forty years, I'm just glad a friend gave me a copy so I could give it back.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I have been using the mouse and really like it a lot. Cord is high quality and the blue lights are cool looking but not visually overwhelming or distracting if playing in low lighting. Also, the mouse is easy to program and the weights are easy to add for that custom feel. The only negative comment I have is in the design..... sometimes my finger slips back from the scroll wheel and the casing behind there is very rough (almost sharp). It actually catches my finger sometimes. Truthfully, it is annoying at worst, but nevertheless the reason I only give 4 of 5 stars. I have a somewhat small hand, but am still able to handle this mouse with ease. People with larger hands should have no difficulty either. Overall, great mouse that compares with higher priced models on the market.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty graphics and fun to play. Not good for kids but adults who want a nice calm game to play
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved the story line.  Touches on various themes that still exist today.  Beautiful to watch, the details of the times are perfect.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The book is amazing. I love the emotion, passion and chemistry between Conner and Megan. It seemed so real. :)
B00B1C39AY|3.0|I prefer more of a beat.  Dave does a great job and the music is well put together, just not high on my list.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|this story is unbelievable... the guy they call sugar man, is truly an artist, and a humble poet... truly an amazing story
B00A8LRIEW|3.0|Did not make me think of the New Order sound I have grown to love.  It is an okay album for me
B0040I09RM|5.0|sons of anarchy is a Great TV show. I did not start watching the series in 2008. I waited until right now 2013 to start watching it via Amazon Prime streaming.<br />it has a great cast, and shows the inner workings of a motorcycle club hell bent on destruction. it has become 1 of my favorite shows on television.
B006P0WMBO|3.0|I love playing Collapse; but this is NOT one of my favorite versions & I'm not really sure why.  It plays like other version; yet I feel empty when done.
B003M70O5O|5.0|See season 1 review. This series is 1 of the best TV series on television. I'm glad I did not start watching it till now
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I didn't like the way the last two books were split, but there were many things in this book that answered lingering questions.  My biggest problem with the book it there are still too many things left hanging and I haven't seen anything that tells when next installment will be released.
1451695195|5.0|I am grateful to have this book in my personal library.  It is wonderful to have a neurosurgeon, at least validate Biblical Prophesy on afterlife.  I am more committed now to prepare my soul for the after life.  I hope I have enough time to make a better life for myself in the life after.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|enjoyed this one so much. I am happy to see I can actually play this on the kindle. Not a bad price either. I cannot wait for more like it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|This app was downloaded for our Grandkids to play with. But when I started seeing charges 1.99. 4.99 and up hitting my Amazon account from poorly defined places &#34;Small pack of Bucks&#34; and &#34;Medium pack of Bucks&#34; I searched Amazon for what was being purchased. I did not find an answer during the search. I happened on it later when I was watching my 3yr. grandaughter playing the game and selecting the stack of money. What a revelation! I started by removing all my payment info from Amazon but later found out I could control it with In-App settings that I had to have an Amazon CSR help me find and for the first time in 2 years activating Parental Controls on our Kindles.<br /><br />I take offence to app builders that hide within their  apps ways to get kids in trouble and assess charges to unsuspecting customers. This app should be banned from Amazon. And I would never download another app from the same company free or not. Ludia is not a company I would want to do business with.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book so over very much can't wait to read book 3. So surprised with all the action then the end was awesome
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I'd have given this pointless,plotless and pitifully scripted film half a star if I were able. It was a total waste of some very good actors' talents'
B003JHKORK|5.0|I loved the story of the deme gods. It seems to be along the lines of a Harry Potter movie.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The idea behind this novel was too wierd to be believable.  I finished reading the book but did not enjoy it.  Much too far out thinking for my taste
B0063IH60K|2.0|Two problems with it. One, it's quite a bit harder to use than the Windows version, Two, I really don't like the advertising I get each time I try to use it. I will be removing it from my Kindle.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I absolutely love the American Horror Story franchise.  This second season was captivating and twisted just like the first.  If you enjoy a dark wild ride, this is your show.  The situations, twists and turns will send chills down your spine and keep you asking for more.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Can't save ANYTHING you do. App will not save any edits.  It says it does, yet the files are nowhere to be found. No response from developer. Very disappointed that I wasted $5.<br /><br />Do not buy.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I can play this game over and over again! I never get tired of it! Thanks for creating such a wonderful game! Keep up the good work.
B0031RS8UI|3.0|I found this book hard to get into until almost half-way through.  The speed at which she achieved domestic bliss was to my mind silly - the end of the book was good.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Mr Clancy is back.  I've waited years for something that resembled his earlier triumphs.  If you are a fan you won't  be disappointed.
0802473156|5.0|It really is a simple way to look at relationships and love if you truly take the time to undertand yours and your significant other's love language. My fiance and I were told to read this book by our premarital counselor. It really has helped us understand each other better.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|Saxon have done it again with &#34;Sacrifice&#34;.  The songs do have great energy as well as the classic saxon style.  The album has a nice sonic tone and the production is awesome.  Highly recommended for any saxon fan or any fan of Classic British style metal.
B004498KPU|5.0|This is an AWESOME SET! Cd's & Dvd! if you are a fan of MJ like me than this is the set to own. I can watch these over & over again & never get tired of them!
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I love that Amazon has this available. And I love this movie. I really would have liked to see Matt Damon in this but the story continues. You still want to know who these secret organizations are and Jeremy Renner is amazing as super soldier, Aaron Cross. Rachel Weisz is a great addition and I like how their relationship progresses.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|A really good movie, but I wish there had been a bit more character development for the Lincoln character. The movie really depended on the audience's knowledge of what kind of man Lincoln was without any explanation of his racial views, which were more complex than the movie indicated, and less acceptable to modern sensibilities than some might think.<br /><br />Some have pointed to historical inaccuracies, which there were, but we really shouldn't expect too much accuracy from a movie. A movie is an entertainment, not a text. People in search of real history should seek out books, not DVDs of popular movies. Still, the movie did a good job of exploring the politics of the time.<br /><br />One other thing that struck me: The lighting was extremely effective, showing how 19 Century lighting looked. It lit our homes, but not with the brilliance we know today.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|Don't buy this if you fell into the Adele craz over her album, 21.  Ick, it is almost 'country' but in a not so good way.  She's still singing about her blown love adventures which is fine, but she seems young, unpolished and the mix and editing (?) is very mediocre.  Totally bummed!
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|You couldn't top the cast, but there was no real drama in the story. The script didn't really develop the characters, it just hinted at the hollows in their lives. No sparks were generated, and the film lacked a sense of drama although the incidents described were certainly dramatic to the characters involved. These actors could have pulled it off if the script and, perhaps the direction, were up to par. Still, I always like to watch old pros work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this game every day still and I got it months ago. The games aren't super hard, but they are really fun.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|This was something of a waste of talent and potential. There's a lot of angst and a lot of talk and not a lot of entertainment. If you're looking for dramatic climax, you might want to look elsewhere. Usually, I can find a lot to like about a movie, even if it's bad. This one, not so much. The actors seemed to be working hard, and that may be part of the problem.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Would recommend this film to anyone who eats food. Is an eye opening look at the food industry in america.
B00340LM8C|4.0|How can the plot go wrong with Cary Grant? Although Kelly is lovely she has trouble acting the part in my opinion. the story is somewhat convoluted but makes it in the end.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|got the kindle and just couldn't stop playing angry birds. angry birds is a very fun game very entertaining and great for hand eye coordination.
B00448SE4S|4.0|My husband is tough on movies. After we watched this last night there was a pause and then my small voice, &#34;Well. Did you like it?&#34; We do our reviews after we watch any movie, so he was prepared.<br />  He can't get past the video game aspect. Maybe if it were explained he could be into that part more. BUT! It is a thoroughly entertaining movie and made him laugh. So in his book, it's a lighthearted, fun, everyonceinawhile type of movie. Not too shabby,<br />Me? I love this movie. I love the video game aspect and don't really care why it is the way it is, because I think it's great. I love the quick dialogue and segue between scenes. I love the characters and friendships. It's not a genuine portrayal of pals and gf's but hey, that's not what I paid for. I paid for fun, funny, actiony-type scenes with a love story at the middle.<br /> Jason Schwatzman as Gideon is fantastic for me. He plays a great, smarmy bad guy.<br />Don't pass up the opportunity to watch this but go into it in the right frame of mind, or you might get hung up a bit. Enjoy!!
B009PJ1Q82|1.0|I found this film pretty stereotypical.  I had a hard time feeling sympathy of any of these characters. they express this undying love, yet they cheat on each other all the time. While Paul is in the rehab, Erik wastes no time cheating and then feigns love and caring later when Paul has a relapse. Simply no believable or identifiable in the least.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Orson Scott Card has a way of bringing characters to life. This book is by no means enders game, but the way the characters interested with one another is very reminiscent of that book. I highly recommend it.
B003L20ICE|3.0|I am half and half about this movie I did like the storyline and the acting was great, but I don't know something was just missing, almost towards the end it just feels incomplete and unresolved. This movie really could have been amazing, but I don't know, I can't really put my finger on why I don't like this movie as much as I know I could have. I do think that the acting was Oscar worthy. Julian's acting was amazing, everyone in this film did an amazing good, I also loved Josh's acting.
B000PY6BBI|4.0|I saw this movie years ago and could remember certain scenes but couldn't recall the ending so i recently watched it again on amazon.<br />I found Matthew Broderick's character to be very entertaining. He narrates the movie through his ongoing conversation with God, which is quite delightful.<br />Rutger Hauer plays the handsome exhiled night who transforms into a wolf when the sun goes down, and Michelle Pfifer play his beautiful lover who transforms into a hawk when the sun rises. Pfifer's beauty far outshines any modern actress, plus she can actually act.<br />They are aided by and exhiled monk in their quest to break the curse they have been living under.<br />The special affects are not spectaculat but this is an old movies, and seems a bit low budget as well. The country side where it was filmed is beautiful and the acting is very good.<br />By the end of the movie I was swept up in the story.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I thought that this movie was going to be awfully boring, but I was completely wrong. I was really never a fan of Marvel, but this movie was so epic and fun and I looking forward to the second movie.<br /><br />The warrior Thor (Hemsworth) is cast out of the fantastic realm of Asgard by his father Odin (Hopkins) for his arrogance and sent to Earth to live among humans. Falling in love with scientist Jane Foster (Portman) teaches Thor much-needed lessons, and his new-found strength comes into play as a villain, (Thor's step brother) from his homeland sends dark forces towards Earth to destroy him and take over his fathers place and become the new king/leader of Asgard.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It has everything you want  Sherlock Holmes to have - murder, mystery, suspense & fun. Great sense of humor and a great new take on the old classics.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I found this app amazingly realistic and it has helped me to learn a lot more about horses.This game is extremely interesting and I would recommend it to anyone who has a taste for horses.
B00119ZMKW|4.0|watched it for the 3rd time and still enjoyed it. Initial issues with the Amazon player were also  fixed. Enjoy!!
0307946711|4.0|Great book! No highlighter! Only one old stick. And I cleaned it very easily. It is  like new right now!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I thought the show had good production value from the start, even if it seemed a little too gory at times; and I also thought some of the big buildups each season might have seemed disconnected from each other, but the final season erased those concerns. This is a series with lots of heart and imagination. It's not campy, even though it would have been easy for them to go that route. I miss Walter and Walternate, Olivia and Fauxlivia, and all the rest, and will soon watch this series again.
B00966TN1Q|3.0|As a Michael Connelly/Harry Bosch fan, perhaps I have become spoiled expecting better work.This is Connelly's weakest book. Charge your batteries for next time,Michael
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Definitely worth the watch.  It draws you in and you can't wait for the next episode!  Thank you for making this available as part of Amazon Prime!<br /><br />Please add Season 3 to Amazon Prime!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is very fun and just challenging enough . The only thing I wish was different is the fact that you have to pay for the mushrooms . Overall , though , it was amazing .
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Just hooked it up in dark hallway. So far so good. Works liked I hoped it would. Don't know how long batteries will last. If I have a problem will let you know.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I was absolutely enthralled.  The book seemed to be speaking to me the whole way through.  I would say it is in my top 5 books ever read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a fun game and they need to make minecarts and rail roads to make faster transportation its really fun
B00BF123WG|4.0|a real good movie a lot of research went into the making of this movie, when bin laden got it i cheered
B004W2UBYW|5.0|didn't know much about SJ except for great products and trend setting the technology landscape. this book opens up his more vulnerable side and explains some the significant influences in his life.
B00BESIKWM|4.0|At first I thought it was junk but this one scared the HELL outta me! I might be getting soft...damn you Hamtaro.
1401324649|4.0|This is the second book I’ve read this year about a man who has left his home and taken to the road and both books were European. (Is this a new trend in European novels?)<br /><br />Road trips are old stories, I suppose, and yet also new. Maybe that’s what we like about them.<br /><br />The main character, Allan Karlsson, in this story is one hundred years old and this is probably more in the tradition of a fairy tale, a Forrest Gump life, than a novel of realistic fiction. Our main character has managed to fight in the Spanish-American War and help create the nuclear bomb in New Mexico. Even at one hundred, Karlsson continues to have adventures, getting caught up in a drama with a suitcase full of money and gangsters trying to get it back.<br /><br />Delightful.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie after all the hype and press about it, but I should have been more supsicious after the reception of Quantum of Solace. While I actually enjoyed QOS despite the horrid opinions of some, I found myself watching the wall half way through this bore fest. I actually managed to slog through the entire film, but much like the worst Bond films, there is very little substance to this film. But unlike the other \\"worst\\" films, there is no flash to at least sit back and enjoy the nonsense... there is only pretentious bull to bore you to sleep and make you wonder if the next two Bond films will even be worth the price of entry. The villain fell flat on every level... the story was absolute rubbish after about 30 minutes, and Bond became an unlikable \\"hero\\" at about the same pace. At least with previous Craig films, and Dalton portrayals, there was a humanisation of Bond that drew you towards the character. In this film.. that is destroyed with his absolute machine like thinking during so much of the film... the other half is of course the required \\"boo hoo I\\"m scarred\\" pretentious crap that is infecting so much of entertainment right now that this Bond and this film just fails on so many levels.<br /><br />I enjoy grittier tales... I enjoyed \\"scarred\\" heroes... but unlike Dalton and his two films, Skyfall just utterly fails on that front and, in the end, fails to deliver a good Bond movie period. How this movie has such overwhelming good reviews beyond me... it is a testament to \\"gritty, dark, edgy\\" absolutely drowning franchise and making it not only insufferable, but frustratingly boring. I recognise I am probably the minority here... but avoid this film if you are a true Bond fan. At best.. you will find Batman masquerading as Bond here... not an actual secret agent that is damaged, but still human.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|loads of fun<br /><br />you will not be bored<br />it gets harder and harder<br />but it is fun<br />give it a try
1476733953|5.0|Okay.<br />I admit it.<br />I was late to the party.<br />Most of the time Amazon sends me recommendations, I totally ignore them.<br />They constantly want me to buy books I already own, some purchased from the site.<br />A `friend' on a bulletin board chastised me for not having already read the serial novel Wool by Hugh Howey.<br />He explained to me Amazon had recommended the story as one he may \\"also enjoy\\", and got it right.<br />WAY RIGHT.<br /><br />So I purchased the Wool Omnibus.<br />And read it.<br />And now I wonder why my head has been stuck in a part of my body it has no business being.<br /><br />Howey's dystopian novel had me from the start.<br />Humans living in a missile type Silo unable to go outside.<br /><br />Hell, people were paying money to do that just before the Mayan Apocalypse.<br /><br />The setting is dark..claustrophobic, you feel yourself sinking further down as the story progresses.<br />Yet somehow Howey has made the story hopeful...uplifting.<br /><br />Some have tired of the dystopian setting so common in much of today's fiction.<br />Wool is more than that.<br />This is beyond genre fiction.<br />Much like society, it is filled with every emotion humanity is capable of.<br /><br />And much like society, Wool works.<br /><br />Amazon (and Hugh Howey!) got it right.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|We bought a few of these to use on our bikes and they are great.Super easy to assemble and put one on each of our bikes. Amazing programmable light shows. They are so cool to look at!Also really made finding our bikes easy in the dark!Highly recommend!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am up to the episode where the war has begun and people at home and at the front are trying to deal with the atrocities as best they can.  It is quite real and quite gripping.  Well done and moving.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is a handy and useful app to have on my Kindle Fire.  It allows you to write, save, and if desired, email notes and check lists.  I particularly like the ability to copy the contents to the clipboard so I can use it to post on the internet.  The app also will store (archive) notes and has a built-in calendar.
B004KA9UXO|5.0|I'd never read Dune before, it's just never come across my path. I can see how it earned it's status as arguably, the best selling sci-fi of all time. Frank Herbert's insights on politics, government and religion; all fictionalised in a future in another galaxy where Earth is but a myth of the past are impressive. I found myself constantly highlighting phrases of profound wisdom to review and ponder at a later time. I can't help but think this was in part inspired by the environment of the Cold War during which it was written, powerplays are largely made by strategy and there are some parallel concepts of nuclear diplomacy.<br /><br />Frank's world of Dune which I'm still continuing to explore is very well defined, he made much effort at providing credible backstory to transport the reader to this future. Early on the book delves into some of the events separating our Earth from now with this future. He's also included appendices in the vein of Tolkein to round out the details of the world, with glossaries of unique terminology and an incredible (for fiction) history of the religious politics that shaped this future.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I'm lovein this game. I highly recamend this for people 6-70. This game best suties 8 &amp; 9 year old's.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Oscar Wilde's writing is full of incisive wit, cunning observation and thought provoking matter. I loved this book, it's paced just right, keeps you thinking with shock turns of events and you might find your mind as twisted as poor Dorian's by the words of Harry.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical of reading this book at first, but into the first couple chapters you can't help but get hooked. I can't wait to start the next book in the series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is the best book I've read and I loved the movie.  Nicholas Sparks writing is the best.  His books contain less violence and sex and are able to keep my interest until the end.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Let me get the issue with the product out right away.<br />I am unable to open the compartment for the weights.  Luckily for me, I like my mice to be light so I do not believe I will requesting a replacement.<br /><br />I picked this mouse in my search to find a replacement for my G500 and its ugly acceleration issues.  I instantly noticed a difference in the acceleration and found the Anker mouse very easy to adjust to.<br /><br />I have a bigger hand so the mouse size is great.  I find no problems with button placement and can easily use all side button keys in my gaming.  The clicks feel crisp, the scroll wheel moves nicely.<br /><br />5 stars because I love the way the mouse feels and operates.  The weights do not matter to me.
B007R108WA|5.0|I read this book, years ago, and loved it. The movie is fantastic! Very difficult to translate a book about &#34;smells&#34; onto the screen, but this all-star cast does a fantastic job of it. Just try to fast-forward through the group orgy scene, because it's pretty gross (everyone is old, fat, and dirty).
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Action, suspense, and characters you can care about and identify with.  Awesome writing. Graphic violence so it's not for young kids.
B001G0MFOM|2.0|It wasn't as good as they said the product would be :( discs were scratched & some of it is not playable but other than that everything else was as expected
B0081336FO|5.0|maybe not better but three more superlative films--how do they deliver such quality consistently?  Cumberbatch is an amazingly nuanced actor.
B0093X80VQ|3.0|My 5-year-old son really liked this story, with the vermicious knids, and how it all happened in one day, and the President calling them and so on.  I didn't enjoy it so much.  The story and the writing weren't as clean as in other Dahl books, and it seemed as though Dahl was thinking the same way that Wonka does.  Finally, there were some sections that used language that we don't use in our house.  I understand that it's an older book, written in the UK, but I can usually edit quickly while I'm reading.  There were a lot of places where I had to choose to skip them or read them as they were written.  That being said, my son loved it and enjoyed reading it and talking about it together.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have owned this DVD for over 5 years and to this day, it is still one of my favorites! I love that it has different levels of intensity so that you can gradually work towards the more intense workouts. Stick with it and you will definitely see results! I recommend this workout DVD to everyone I know that is looking for a way to add some variety to their workout routine!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story and the way it was written.  I have not seen the movie but was able to envision the characters faces as I read…Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, etc. I recommend it.
B004EBBPU0|5.0|After the movie, did some online research. Led me to see what a great job Oliver Stone did in making this movie. Also, Val Kilmer is fantastic in the role. It's a bummer about Jim Morrison's fate, but the other Doors made it further with their lives. Crazy to enter their world through this movie. Drugs, Alcohol, Sex, and Rock...wow, surviving that mix and making it into heaven is quite the redeeming challenge. Oh Jim where are you today?
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|As dissappointing as Jackson's interpretation of the Hobbit is (not even close to the book), this DVD is the best you can own if you want to add this to  your JRR Tolkein collection.
081297381X|2.0|This book is like a detective story full of tension but never caught the bad guy. After the first 1/3, the book starts repeating itself, over and over, very boring. Not informative and not fun.
B002EMESSM|5.0|When I first saw ST:TMP in the theaters over 30 years ago I felt the same way many did - that it was disappointing.  It had its moments: Introduction of the 'new' Klingons, Kirk & Scotty's flyby of the refit Enterprise, Spock's Kolinahr ritual on Vulcan and his subsequent reunion with Kirk.  But over the years that disappointment has turned to enjoyment.  The Original Series was often criticized as being too cerebral, and TMP takes that quality even further and I frequently find myself thinking over the themes of TMP as I watch it again and again, figuring out different angles each time.  Granted that sci-fi movies in the post-Star Wars era are expected to be action-packed, but there's still room for a Star Trek movie in which no one fires a phaser.
B004LROUW2|2.0|A rather boring and unremarkable novel that attempts to blur the line between mystery/thriller/fantasy and serious literature. The author repeatedly references Orwell, Kafka, and Chekhov, but achieves none of the brilliance or nuance that made such authors great. Occasionally character motivation is distressingly suspect or absent, and one protagonist is fairly uninteresting, making those chapters even more tiresome. There are a few interesting passages, and the plot is handled with some skill, but not enough to save it from ultimately being uninteresting.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this album, along with its price. It was in great condition and it was just a great CD in general!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I didn't want to use it as I didn't want to join a group of people on facebook to play it.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|The portrayal played by Daniel Day Lewis is remarkable. He deserved the Oscar and received it. I am happy to have watched it and also happy to now have the movie in my collection
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I found this game hard to put aside. I had to play it til I conquered it. Never could have done it without the hints though. The graphics were nice and clear so the eyes didn't give out looking for objects. Good story line kept the suspense going.
B0094K1JPC|3.0|Old dog.  New Tricks.  Storyline a bit overused even though this allegedly had a different twist.  Watch it if you have nothingbetter to do or if you are a Harrison Ford fan.
B0099XX46Q|1.0|This is a terrible movie. It is made by chinese and for chinese. I knew that chinese control Hollywood, but now I see that they completely own it. If you still want to watch an american movie, buy movies made before 2011 with a few exeptions like \\"Robin Hood\\" by R. Scott or \\"Hobbit\\".
B004R2DS9C|3.0|This was ok I guess<br />it was a gift for my nephew for Christmas, didnt seem like much to it
B0012HEB32|5.0|It's too bad this show was canceled, as the last 5 or 6 episodes were really drawing me into this.  The writer's strike killed this show, as it did many others, and it's a shame because this was one of the few shows on network TV that I made a point of watching when it aired.
8186336141|5.0|Very thorough info that's easy to understand. Only negative is that some asana are called by different  English names than I am used to so it gets a little confusing.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Between his naturally beautiful singing voice meshing with the carefully structured musical arrangement, Ed Sheeran will blow you away! \\"Give Me Love\\" is by far the most powerful song on the album; however every lyric of every song is nothing but raw energy and an exposed truth.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very graphic and emotional. I'm glad I read the book begore seeing the movie. I can't believe the movie could express the many emotions of Pi
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Good case the only bad thing is that it makes it harder to type and only certain ear phones and chargers will fit
B000RIWAVW|5.0|classic movie......have not watched it since I was a kid...... on VHS. that must have been 30 years ago. Watching again with my 13 yr old.Hope he appreciates a classic.
B00AEBB8BA|5.0|Bought for my husband's birthday because loves it!!  Have been looking for it for awhile and I found it here.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|This is a great set for the price. If you want a Thor figure this is perfect . . .
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite movie, she has watched over and over since it arrived. One of the best investments.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|This is a long and tedious rendition of The Hobbit. The ugly part is that there are supposed to be two more movies to finish the book.<br /><br />It has been years since I read the book but as I watched I found myself wondering where in the book some of the things that were happening in the movie were. Did I somehow miss this stuff when reading the book?<br /><br />The scenes in the Shire at the beginning was so slow and dull that I stopped watching on the first evening. Since I had paid good money for the DVD, I tried to watch again the next evening in hopes that things would pick up. No such luck. I finally shut it down during the scene in the cave with Bilbo and the Gollum and switched on the paint drying channel for some excitement.<br /><br />I'm going to try to return the DVD to Amazon as defective since it did not work as expected - to cause any interest at all.<br /><br />This movie was a disappointment  - so much so that I will have to dig out my copy and read it again to cleanse my now tarnished remembrance of the classic book that was The Hobbit.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Awesome as usual. Sheldon and Amy are hilarious and make the season very enjoyable. The best episode is the spoiler alert a must see for any Big Bang/Harry Potter fan.
B00094ARZ0|5.0|Yep, there's no one like Bo!  No one like John Derek, either!  He sure liked to re-invent his women!  A true classic!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|We generally liked this but I thought they could have delivered more on the moral of the story, namely that we all have a calling in life that we should strive to know and accept.  &#34;Glitch&#34; is a cool character and is lovable. Ralph decent.  Nice relationship developed there.  Also liked the Fix It Felix character and the military woman (forget her name).  The story gets a little confusing for kids with some of the techy stuff.  Felt like I was watching Alice in Wonderland at times.  You'll like it I think.
B008Y73940|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It was a fastpace, well played movie.  Marissa Tomei & hottie Matthew M. had amazing performances.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This book was very interesting and kept me reading late into the night.  I like this author, good character development and creation of suspense.  I bought this book because I read another book written by the same author that was very good.
B00000JNOJ|2.0|I like Muddy, hell, I like just about any Blues. However this session sounds like he was &#34;on the nod&#34;. The lyrics seem mumbled and the instrumentals lack intensity or the virtuosity I've come to expect. While not musically collectable you might want it in your collection as an example of &#34;Heroin Blues&#34;.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Have not read this book yet.  See Dark Places which was a very good<br />book.  I purchased three of Ms. Flynn's books.
B0012GMWCU|4.0|The title says it all, if you love &#34;The Blues&#34; you'll like this. It's classical Mizsippy sounds. Not sorry .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|perfect game for ppl that love and want a horse but don't have funds for a real one or the space.
B00004THAY|4.0|Really great Blues guitar, but what else could it be. Two masters doing some of their best. Well produced. If you like either or both, it's worth having.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I bought this to accompany the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" which I bought for my daughter.  She loves its revolving capability, and it fits in her purse, so it's a winner!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My brother told me about this program. He was told about Downton Abbey from our sister!  I can not wait for new season!  I will watch this season again and again!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downtown Abby takes us back in time. The people and their lives exemplify human nature.<br />This is a series that cannot be forgotten and that one cannot stop watching!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed all the seasons.  The characters are rich with personalities; you can't help but get pulled into their motives and thoughts. The characters grow and evolve as the show does and they bring you along for the ride.
B000M39HB8|5.0|This is a great holiday favorite movie ... but the download and streaming made the movie not run smoothly ... I would recommend getting the DVD ...
1609611543|1.0|Mr. Davis spends alot of time trying to convince the reader that wheat is the evilest of evils, even throwing around lots of big science words, relying on the high probability that you don't know what any of it means and thinking \\" he sounds smart, so he must know what he's talking about.\\" While there is SOME true information in this book, most of the claims aren't backed up by any real studies. Mr. Davis likens his casual observations to scientific evidence and makes broad claims as a result of them. The book primarily focuses on demonizing wheat, blaming it for countless medical and social problems, and then gives you whip-lash when he suddenly reveals that in order for you to lose weight and find the path of health, you're actually going to have to give up ALL carbs AND nearly all sugar. I'm not just talking about giving up soda and cookies. Forget about beans and fruit too. They have evil sugar as well. What?? I thought this book was about eliminating Wheat? Now the road to health is paved with cheeseburgers? Nice sneak-attack, but we've already heard of this diet before, its called the Atkins diet. If that diet was truly as amazing as it claimed to be, obesity would no longer be the raging epidemic that continues to grow. If you'd like to read a book about improving your diet that is written by Doctors that actually know how to conduct scientific research, I recommend The China Study. Also, if you're ready to hear the truth about all the processed foods you've been eating, check out Sugar, Salt, Fat. You will never eat a Cheet-o again.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Great story and acting! Love it and would highly recommend!  We could use some heroes these days, and this one is worth watching :). You feel good after seeing this movie :)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think this book was the best book of this sequel. I would recommend this to people who enjoy Roman and Greek stuff. Over all , I think this book was absolutely FANTASTIC !!!!!!!!  Job well done Rick Riordan !!!!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It is fun, it never stops so it never gets boring, and you can keep unlocking new genes for your disease.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Got this on time and it's wonderful. My other USB cord started getting cracks in it and I decided to get a new one. This one is great. Charges my Kindle and everything. I love this charger.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I loved this app because it is fun, it keeps going, and you can always unlock new things for the towers.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Get the game I love it so much I play it all day and all night buy it now :)
B008C20TDG|5.0|This is an important and thoughtfully-written book and program...the keys to the kingdom of health and vitality are in the information presented here...the Hartwigs really know their stuff and don't present any suggestions without plenty of easy-to-understand and accurate info to back them up. And what's more, they are incredible motivators! The goals are totally realistic and attainable, and the minute I started reading the book I knew there was no good excuse for *not* following through with the Whole30. Very grateful!
B00B69UQEO|5.0|So just received Delta Machine as a gift.  I have been a DM fan for decades and feel this album does not disappoint.  I was not particularly fond of SOTU but loved Playing the Angel.  I know prior to Delta Machine's release, there were a lot of comments being made that it seemed to represent a mix of Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion.  However, with the exception of 1 or 2 songs, i think the album is quite independent in terms of sound.  There are elements that do remind you of older DM albums/songs, but as a whole, the album is different, but in a good way.  I actually do love the album.  The sound is very different, but it has good energy to it and it has a good flow of the tracks.  I do enjoy that artists take risks and try to change up their usual sound.  I like the evolution of artists in their music because it displays how they have changed as people.  I think this album is great and although it may not be what you expect from a DM album, it does have a DM feel to it.  I strongly recommend checking it out and listening to it.
0394716787|5.0|Its exactly what it claims to be. As far as I can tell, there are absolutely no missing poems or stories. The cover art is kind of blah, but I don't care about that! Nothing can take away from the beauty of his works!
B004Q7IAQE|5.0|I love it and i was surprised because it was a good size<br /><br />It was a great gift and she loved it
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|After some difficulties with my razor mouse and having two Logitech mice that just didn't last long enough I wanted to try something new. I am quite pleased with this mouse. The scroll wheel is nice and firm and the laser behaves well when the mouse is lifted. The 3 buttons near the thumb take some getting used to if you are used to using the 2 thumb button configurations. The one issue is that the 2nd button below the mouse wheel cannot really be pressed in the midst of action since it sits at around the base of my index finger, and its pretty much unreachable without moving my whole hand; but that's not a big deal for me.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this was a super fun game. I did have some problems every once in a while with the sights and the fire button but that's a minor problem compaired to everything else
B008FRFN7A|4.0|I like the kindle.having hard time printing I have tried everything to set it up just not working right Will keep any way has other things I like.
B007SGM084|3.0|This story ,on the surface is pure porn but read it again to relish the real story and you find the true meaning, which is how much a child can be harmed very early in life.  So go hug your kids and make sure they know they are loved for themselves and their own uniqueness.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an amazing read. I saw the movie before I read it and found many differences. I enjoyed the book much more. It kept me reading because I was  on the edge of my seat the whole time. I can't wait  to read the next books in the series.
1451695195|5.0|This book was a gift, but the recipient said it was excellent.  She said she received much comfort from reading it.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly has stepped up to fill the gap left by the demise of Google Reader, and I for one, think that they have done a great job. Easy to set up and customize.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is awesome i just loved it it did not freeze on me or it did mess up like other games do if i were i would download this game because it is like no other game trust me u will like it or i mean love it
1451608659|5.0|When Dominique first burst on to the scene, we loved her.  She was not only a great gymnast, but she seemed so positive.  However, fans just 'knew' something was wrong, the way her dad seemed to decide before she did that she'd be a gymnast.  We thought the emancipation vindicated our feelings, but now we know what Dominique herself didn't even know.<br /><br />I'ts so hard to read, remembering how Luminita Misenko seemed to be the answer to all of Dominique's problems, what happened to that coaching situation.  To read how our hero and role model was capable of making the same poor choices the rest of us make, proving nothing but how normal she is.  Most incredibly is the apparent lack of bitterness on Jennifer Bricker's part about the circumstances surrounding her adoption.  Now, every time I watch a highlight reel or documentary and something is shown from the 1995 Nationals, I don't think of it as the night Dominique became a champion, I think of it as the night two parents saw her on TV and said Oh. My. God.<br /><br />I'm also floored at Dominique's ability to forgive after what she's been through.  I don't know if I would be able to in such situations.<br /><br />I had the privlige of meeting Dominique and her amazing husband Mike during her book tour.  They are both so real.  I can't think of any other word to describe her.
B00992CF6W|5.0|GET THIS APP!!!!!!! I really think everyone should buy this app. I cant stop playing!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!!! play it please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|A marvelous and brilliant classic!  A must read about the importance of perspective, dealing with the difficulties of life, effort and good friends.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I read Forgotten Garden and loved the story & style so I purchased House at Riverton and enjoyed it as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this booK . It is one of those books that  will remain in my heart. Her writing style is flawless and fantastic. I would surely read the next one  NO HOPE. It will be fantastic as this. Colleen Hoover is one fantastic author.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|fun, enjoyable to play, wish you wouldn't have to wait so long to get more hearts to enable you play longer
B0065CCM76|5.0|How can you go wrong with Seger? Ultimate hits is as fine as they come.  This album brings back the sounds that have been used in movies all across the spectrum and rocks that I had to put it in the different playlists that I have. Get this, you won't be sorry. I accidentally ordered it twice because it was sent to download it twice. From now on I will be very vigilant about whether it was already bought or not.
B00BYOEMTQ|3.0|Even with beautiful cinematography and great cgi, I fell asleep halfway through. Maybe, I just felt I'd seen the same film before with the Lord of the Ring trilogy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.I got this game 3 days ago and I'm not board with it yet. The game is easy to play and would be fun for kids of all ages and its free
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Exciting true story, great acting, and fast-paced direction kept me riveted from start to finish.  This movie earned every award it won!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Got game for my 6 year old grandson. It looked like something that would keep him from being<br />bored. Thought I should try it first. When I saw what time it was, I had been playing for close to<br />an hour. It felt like 15 min.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|Acting a little weak Gets a little bloody but keep interest up. Maggie Simm and Kim Coates are pretty good.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love it billions of times that you say . I'm 13 and live for fairies yeah yeah as h yeah yeah
B002KGEORM|3.0|Acting a little weak Gets a little bloody but keep interest up. Maggie Simm and Kim Coates are pretty good.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|they are one of few modern groups that still understand the art of music. check out babel if you like this album
B001MSMUH0|5.0|Ken Robinson has gathered a varied set of people to successfully illustrate the capturing of The Element. I highly recommend this book.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|If you like Justin's contributions to the Moody Blues, you will love this album.  He and his collaborators have created some great songs.  I especially liked &#34;On the Road to Love&#34;.  Thanks for the great tunes.  I hope for more in the near future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 3 year just keeps playing this game. I really didn't think much of it until I saw her little fingers and eyes moving the man. Humorous and entertaining, this game is a winner in a sea of losers.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Good acting, good storyline/plot.  Modern day &#34;Goonies&#34; or &#34;Stand By Me&#34;.  If you enjoyed either of these movies you will probably enjoy this one.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|We love this program. Please recommend more shows similar to this tv series. I would love to receive a discount for being a loyal customer.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game &amp; play it daily on my Kindle Fire as eell as on my Android smartphone! Lots of fun...would recommend to all!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great story told by an Amazing American hero.<br />R.I.P. Chris Kyle - gone but never forgotten. Thank you for my freedom.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Abby and Travis are such a great couple. Their chemistry is so addictive. Loved the whole story line of this book. One of my absolute favorites! Cannot wait for the second book to come out!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A very good twist on a familiar troupe. But in the end everything (well almost) was wrapped up, just like the TV show. While it was intriguing and entertaining, at the end it felt very familiar ...
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Great show!  Can't wait to get to Season 4!  I'm addicted.  Wish I didn't know that it ended this year.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved this movie it had a good story. j j j j j j j j j j j
B009FZHYKU|3.0|The quality of Amazon Instant Video is unparalleled. It's awesome. The one huge problem that I have is, I cannot find where closed captioning for these videos is offered. It's a deal breaker for me as Hill and Netflix both offer it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app does exactly as it says. I have managed appointments. Saved photos. I also keep my families schedule and appointments.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I didn't want to put it down; I've recently been pulled into the orbit of Kate Morton's novels, and I haven't found one which has disappointed so far. An Authoress indeed.
B008VVT51U|2.0|I wouldn't wait untill it ended, I did not turn it because friends were watching it also, turns out they thought it was  a waste of time.<br /><br />I would not recommend it to anyone so many better movies to watch.
0140186395|5.0|Excellent book a must read. Denser than a lot of his other work. Gripping from start to finish. I would start with in dubious battle, cannery row or grapes of wrath first.
B00A757EFW|2.0|When I tried to play the game on my tablet, I discovered I had downloaded the Amazon website with it.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|The movie is a grand success in portraying the humility of the man. We may feel his life is incomplete, but I suspect few will understand his path.<br /><br />I am in awe of Rodriguez.
160774273X|5.0|I bought this book for the cover and to learn how to make artisan bread.  I spent a few evenings reading and cross referencing the Internet as needed.  I made the 80% biga white bread for my first ever baked bread.  Following the book, my first two bread loaves (one batch) baked awesomely in my lodge 5 quart cast iron Dutch oven.  I can see why Ken quit his day job.  My bread was well received and the finished breads were amazing.  I feel the book was incredibly helping me understand that there is no finite instruction and the author does a tremendous job of describing properties to look for throughout the process to insure success.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love this app. Very easy to use, intuitive layout, lots of extras. Go beyond Instagram and make your photos pop!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy courtroom drama and the viewer gets that in addition to a good continuing story-line.  This series has everything -- infidenity, politics, corruption scandl, love of family and an interfering mother-in-lawl and the way it affects wife, mother and lawyer, Alicia Florrick, as she tries to get her life back on track.  Julianna Margulies and Chris Noth are wonderful. I couldn't get enough of this series and continued watching Series 2, 3, and 4.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|The classic of the classics. I heard someone in the industry saying that this was one of top scifi series, and it is true, loved everything about it. Sad that they stopped it so early.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|If you loved season 1, then you will not be disappointed with season 2.  The story continues and our knowledge of what motivates those in survival mode grows.  It has suspense and surprise, two good elements for entertaining watching.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|this is a solid show, great characters. your suspension of disbelief is exercised, but not without rewards. the pacing is fantastic and the grotesque moments are not overly gratuitous. i'd feel confident recommending this to anyone, yet i don't doubt it's not for everyone; ie: it's worth giving it a try! =)
B005S9EKCW|5.0|If you haven't seen it, make this a priority.  It is one of the very best transition from live theater to film I have seen.
B000HZED8S|3.0|It's really too bad that this &#34;dieselpunk&#34; film had a throwaway screenplay, because it had a lot of potential. It probably set back dieselpunk and steampunk films for a long time.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I gave this five stars not because of the Zombies, but rather the character development in those surviving the Zombies.  Excellent writing and acting will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend this show.
B0023S50DO|3.0|The script to this movie is made of commercial off-the-shelf materials. Pretty much the only thing that can be said about it is that it was better than Armageddon. It had basically one good line. Acting was uninspired. Special effects were boring.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As far as the three books go, this was as good as the rest, and a must read to see what transpired with all the characters.  It was a good story, but not something I'd struggle through a second time.  I had to keep my own interest level up, because the story line didn't do it for me.  The writing and plot lines were great, and the author had great continuity, so it was just the subject that wasn't my particular cup of tea.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great Solitaire app, but I hate the pop up ads. They drive me crazy. I thought that once I paid to rid my Kindle fire of ads, I wouldn't have to deal with this junk any more.
1451648537|1.0|This biography was not what I expected, to say the least. It was basically bashing Jobs and his personality. Everyone knows that Steve was a tough man to work with but his brilliance shone through with his work. He pushed people to their limits to get the best products made, and to develop great technology.  While I understand that his style of working was very demanding, that is because his brilliants was way beyond many of his employees so he go annoyed by stuff that he viewed as stupidity. Mr. Isaacson repeatedly reminds readers that Jobs told him to write it the way he wanted, without censorship. This protects Isaacson from all the criticism that he has received from writing this book. Instead of him highlighting Steve's vision for the world of technology, he portrayed him as a CEO that ridiculed his employees at every opportunity. Steve revolutionized every industry he touched. From Music to Movies, Computers to Tablets, he changed the world for the better. I am shocked that this book was allowed to be released as Steve's legacy because it is a far cry from what Steve accomplished in his lifetime. I can only hope that someone else will come along and write the true life of Steve P. Jobs.
B000000XB9|5.0|For some reason I never 'got into' classic rock such as CCR in my younger days. I now realize I've been missing out. Every song on this CD is gold and is just so perfect to listen to. I can imagine buying this on cassette because just letting it play is the way to go. Onward to brighter days now that this fantastic genre has come into my life.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|I played this on kindle fire without any problems. The graphics are good. It was just ok for me as far as the game. I didn't like the constant talking and there wasn't much suspense. It was worth 99¢ and I will play it again. The game was short. It just wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I like more adventure and some h/o but the games in it were different and difficult. You might like it. Sorry G5 I enjoyed all the other games from you and have many.
B009KEN87O|5.0|3D Retro graphics that are great to look at.  Great gameplay mechanics and great enemy patterns.  I love the code dropping on the last zone!  Nice touch!  A must by for shooter fans.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The graphics were great and had a lot of play time. I like adventure and h/o. I played on a kindle fire and went on a great adventure with this game. It is just hard enough but not frustrating. I would recommend this to others that like adventure games. It isn't scary but may be too much for children because the pirate is creepy as you saw in the pics. I will play this again. Thanks G5.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I loooveeeeee this show and can hardly wait for the next season to be available. Fabulous acting. I knew who Claire Danes was but hadn't seen her work, thought she was just another blonde. BOY WAS I WRONG!!! So want to see her hook up with Brody again. Great supporting cast, intense story lines and very addictive.
B000WBZ5M0|5.0|It was a great performance by all the actors and the geeting even was also amazing . I like the idea of honor among thieves
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I rate this show very highly due to the authentic costumes - period to perfection - and the wonderful actors - Could watch it over and over again
B009186JYI|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my little sister because the Rolling Stones were the first band we saw together. They were on their first American tour and we were really young teenage girls, screaming, running back stage and chasing their cars. Brian was still alive, and they we so young. We would have run away to England to see them if we could have; so this is the next best thing to bring back the memories of those days. Great footage, enjoy.
B0051T46XM|5.0|Hollywood needs to take a page from this and show how a story should be written! For a lower budget movie, this one pulls it off! Trolls! I haven't seen a decent Troll movie since TROLL but this is no apartment and these Trolls are massive! I don't want to review the movie and give anything away but this is a good Friday night guy flick.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app and site!! I cant get enough of this site! its also great for businesse advertising to!
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|John Lajoie said it best. There isn't that annoying sore throat Christian Bale garbage here. Straight out of the comic book presentation here! I am not a fan of The Dark Knight, but the early work by Clooney, Keaton, and Kilmer are amazing. Yes, cheese is everywhere but the Batmen were of the comic version I knew and loved. Not the depressing, annoying, frog-in-throat, garbage we have now.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and does all the basic functions a lazy person doesn't want to calculate in their heads. What more do you expect?!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This version of Mahjong has presented a great deal of challenge in its ever changing intensity.  The tiles and colors are wonderful.
B0084FMCI6|5.0|I have had many Teva sandals over many years using them for casual hiking and daily use.  I live very near the seashore--in Florida in the winter and on Cape Cod in the summer--so they really get a workout with sand and salt water.  They really survive--only to be replaced when they finally just wear out.  I highly recommend them.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|While not a heavy user of LInked In,  this service has been very helpful reconnecting me with people I've lost track of.<br />I had a few friends from 20 years ago that reached out and now we're exchanging ideas again.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a nice little Mahjong game.  It has 3 modes. One is the basic solve the board. Another times you how long it takes to solve the board. The third forces you to make a move in a set amount of time. If the board locks up because of the moves you make it gives you an option to reshuffle the pieces or to start over.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Another great game from Rovio. These games are quite addictive and fun to while away time waiting on transportation or at the doctor's office.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and me and my two love to play it. It is fun to play when you are board but it can get ignoring with when you need to feed your horse all the time
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is a great game following the tradition of other &#34;Angry Bird&#34; games. Highly addictive and pretty challenging. Bird figures are hilarious too.
B008220C38|5.0|This Anna Karenina was the best movie! It was beautiful. \\" There can be no peace for us,  only misery and the greatest happiness \\" what LOVE!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|nice set of puzzles. not very tough, so everyone in family enjoys playing. popular with all the kids. ++++++++++++++ +++++++++++++++
1451673442|5.0|Love this book...definantly made me have a diffrent outlook on life.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|We were told by friends of the quality and enjoyment THE GOOD WIFE has brought them. After watching a few episode, like them, we highly recommend this series.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It has helped me put my idea's together with the ideas's from other's who have post on the website first.
0321356683|5.0|I'll start this review telling you what this book is not:<br />- This is not a cookbook. You will not find template solutions to regular programming problems here.<br />- This is not a &#34;fun&#34; book. This is not like the Head First books where they have lots of funny stuff to keep you entertained.<br />- This is not a book for beginners. If you are just starting to learn programming, this will only leave your mind in a very confused state.<br />- This is not &#34;just a Java book&#34;. Although most of the topics described in this book are tightly related to Java's mechanics and implementation details, it has a lot of great teachings that are language agnostic.<br /><br />That being said, this book is a very deep analysis on many diverse topics, most of them centered on Java's mechanics, language features and most prominent flaws. You can expect, for example, lost of pages explaining how to correctly implement a serializable class or how to clone an object correctly. But you will not only get answers here. Most topics include a very throughout explanation on the logic behind the solutions and the potential pitfalls and risks of failing to follow the suggestions described and even counter-intuitive problems derived from design flaws in the Java language.<br />I will admit that many of the topics of the books have no practical use unless you have to implement a low level solution from scratch or you are working on a very important project where a design flaw might cause catastrophic failure. Still, I guarantee that anyone who reads this book will find something useful.
B00005JOA0|5.0|The acting was conversational, the countryside setting framed the mood of the story well.  I recommend this to any fan of BBC films concerning the Bronte's, Jane Austen, etc.  It holds it's own.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you are a Firefly fan, you will certainly love Serenity, This movie has all the action and humor of the series and it serves as a great follow up to the (saldy) unfinished series. The story clears up some plot elements that are left unanswered in the TV chapters and it gives a better insight in some characters.<br />As for the physical product, the packaging is nothing special, it's just the DVD with it's plastic case. The DVD comes with some extras like director's commentary and deleted scenes. Nothing you wouldn't expect. Still, this movie is fantastic and the only reason you wouldn't want to see it is if you haven't seen Firefly yet.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love the books and the movie was great and is was as the book was with great detailing to every action.
B00BP4X7TG|4.0|Great story but a little hard to watch because of the sub titles.  Would love to watch an English version.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|The COMPLETE Sherlock Holmes collection. If you like Sherlock, you have to have this. I like the setup it's nice.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It started out a little overdone, but quickly settled into a good rhythm and turned out to be a great book.  Looking forward to more.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|this game is terrible. once I got it gave me a download now I can not play on it plus you have to pay for kibble and jewels!

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like playing Diamond Dash.  You only have a minute to get as many diamond colors off the screen.  You have to be fast.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Amazon is in error in NOT listing DTS-HD Master Audio under \\"Languages\\"! DTS (Digital Theatre Stereo) kicks butt on Dolby Surround Sound!! DTS is on a few older DVD movies, but all new movies put out these days ONLY include DTS-HD Master Discrete Audio 7.1 on the BLUE RAY version!  The cheap $15 DVD version of \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" has only Dolby Digital Surround Sound available!! If you want to \\"Rock the house!\\", you will need to upgrade to a Blue ray player or surround sound receiver that can \\"de-code\\" DTS! My older Sony DVD player, with digital coaxial cable hook-up to my Sony receiver, \\"rocks\\" my house, if the DVD has DTS on it!!  If the DVD package does NOT have the DTS symbol on the back of the package, then it only has Dolby available! Examples of older DVD movies that have DTS are: \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" (YES!! \\"English DTS Discrete ES 5.1 (under \\"set-up\\"), all \\"Lord of the Rings\\" DVD's(EXTENDED version sets only!! Awesome!!), and the Celtic Woman DVD, \\"Live at Slane Castle\\" (awesome again!!), and the first \\"Narnia\\" DVD, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" (DTS Discrete ES 5.1). Also the 1997 Live Bee Gees concert DVD \\"One Night Only\\", includes DTS! (WOW!!) If you have NOT heard of DTS yet, then do some research on-line!! It is soooo much better than Dolby!!  It adds bass and sounds you never heard before (like \\"Frodo\\"'s \\"breathing\\" as he climbed Mt Doom!!!! Get out your Owner's Manual's for your components and look for DTS capabilities!!  I have had DTS decoding capabilities for 6 years on my 5 disk Sony DVD/CD player, and didn't know about THAT and DTS until 2 weeks ago while watching and episode of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\"! Enjoy!!
B009EEFTMC|1.0|I tried to download from my computer to my Kindle with no results.  This looked interesting and disappointed I can't play it.
B000060P79|4.0|Though I know Simple Plan can be fairly emo, I do like their music.  I have a few of their albums, and always enjoy listening to them, especially on road trips.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Pixar has continued their tradition of great movies with Brave, and what better way to own one, than to have it in multiple formats!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I've seen other versions but I liked this best.  The actors, sets, countryside, were wonderful.  I'm an Anglophone anyway so I could escape into this story.  I rarely watch anything more than once but I will make an exception here!
B004I1WIWU|4.0|Adele is a great singer whose style is like the soul singers of the past. The only other similar charting singer recently was Amy Winehouse. Most of the others these days have a very synthetic sound. I love that she uses simple arrangements where the voice really shines but there is sameness to all the songs that gets a bit tedious after a while.
B00003CXRM|2.0|Opened this up and found it was not original DVD and didn't come with the booklet that a new DVD would have
B000001F76|5.0|After visiting Birmingham this was a must have.<br />We were always Hank Williams' fans, but now<br />know why he was one of the best songwriters of all<br />time.

B00899F0G8|5.0|This show is a complete guilty pleasure for me.  As a veronica mars fan, I have been having hard time finding something slightly girly, a mystery, and was smart enough to keep me guessing. this did it. Thanks!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|just like all the other tile moving games...simple, straight forward and fun. even my 5 year old likes playing it.
031620157X|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read. It's very interesting and hard to put down it has u on the edge of your seat and at some moments u will just crack up laughing! I know I did
0374533571|4.0|Good Story. At times the storyline was redundant but I still enjoyed the characters and the way the author portrayed them!
B008J34466|5.0|in this album pink gives us an album full of hit songs great album recommended to pink fans and lovers of good music
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Another emotional book by this talented author. Adolescent love, death, drama...all wrapped in one. The end surprises even the most astute reader. A must read for Picoult fans.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This has become my go to CD for traveling in my car.  Rock at its best, it makes me smile.  The included DVD was an unexpected  bonus.  I watch it before going to bed every nite, just makes me happy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book! I love it! I read Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mocking Jay REALLY fast! One of my faves!
B005QUQP76|5.0|Nothing negative to report on this mouse. I got it for $53, and I love it. Textured surface to it's pretty easy to keep a firm grip on it. Scrolling wheel feels really nice. Thumb buttons are a perfect size. Weight and size are great (although to be fair I have large hands). 10/10 would buy again and recommend to friends.
B0037VNX44|1.0|Not worth your time. Extremely boring and not well filmed. I definately would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to listen to something as you fall asleep.
B009178OQA|5.0|Amazing story.  If you love sushi, this will leave you hungry for more. A man who spent his whole life seeking the perfect sushi.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|As a Jane Austen and P & P fan, I found this mystery very entertaining.  I particularly liked the way James wrote it in an Austen-like style.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It's a shame that this was canceled. Especially with some of the garbage that is on these days. Hopefully there's another movie in the future.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written!<br />There is nothing dry about this history.  One learns about the personalities involved in one of the most important times in American history.
072325804X|5.0|An exquisite copy of Beatrix's classic animal charactered children's tales -  of heirloom quality. Beautifully illustrated with easy to read larger lettering. Wonderful and warm stories. As a child I grew up being read these stories and was so pleased to revisit them as an adult. These old world simple stories captivate the imagination and make wonderful bed time readings to young children, or as a collectible for the young of heart.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I loved this game. I was so addicted,  I played it nonstop for a week. However,  I had to give this game two stars because of the GLITCH. I know some people have already mentioned this,  but I had to scroll all the way down the list to find a comment that said this. WHEN YOU GET A LEVEL TEN HAMMERHEAD, THE GAME RESETS TO LEVEL ONE REEF SHARK WITH ALL OF YOUR MONEY AND GEMS. BE CAREFUL!!!!!
0670026557|5.0|This is an amazing book.<br /><br />If you don't believe that, you need to wander through the five pages of glowing reviews from people whose name you may know, like Malcolm Gladwell, Dan Pink, Susan Cain, and Dan Ariely. Even reclusive author Seth Godin puts in his two cents.<br /><br />So what's it all about, and why should you read it?<br /><br />Adam Grant's theory is about people in business and in life who are givers and takers. You may be confused (hey, I was!) about his stories of people who missed out on big opportunities, like the basketball manager who passed over people like Michael Jordan. And these are success stories?<br /><br />But as you read more of the book, you begin to realize that the givers, while having occasional failures, tend to be far more useful than the takers in their sphere of influence. Consider the world of business - there are a few, like salespeople, who are in competition with each other. Nothing stops those who want the trip to Hawaii rather than the set of steak knives.<br /><br />But the majority of us have to co-operate with our fellow-workers. Managers usually see who strive to impress against those who encourage the people that work with them, so that the whole department excels. It's all too easy to blame those who need help, rather than giving them the help.<br /><br />What Adam Grant is saying (and I don't think he says it clearly enough) is that taking is a strategy that works in competitive situations, whereas giving works best in co-operative areas. What he also doesn't push hard enough is that taking helps in certain instances, whereas giving builds your reputation. And taking is a dangerous game when you worry that your actions might be exposed as grabbing what isn't really yours - hardly good for your reputation.<br /><br />So, what's the result of giving rather than taking? Do nice guys finish first or last? The answer is - it depends. If you look at individual actions, some people get ahead by taking. But when you look at the big picture, the givers do well. People who volunteer at work or in their social life gain experience that gives their job performance a continuous improvement.<br /><br />Grant examines the problem of burnout. If you want to help others, you should put a few walls up. Don't be \\"The Girl who can't say `No',\\" as one of his examples turned out to be. When your own job performance slips because of your wish to help, it's time to re-examine the scope of your involvement.<br /><br />So does Grant put his point over well? I guess, being used to the business books mantra of \\"Do this, and this benefit will follow,\\" I found it a little difficult to follow. He doesn't show you the benefits of one person's giving until later in the book, sometimes many chapters away. But there's a final chapter called \\"Actions for Impact\\" which gives plenty of tips, and also web sites that can help you.<br /><br />I went to the site mentioned (giveandtake) and did the test. Not surprisingly, it identified me as a giver. However, it became clear during the test which answers would lead to specific results, and I think I over-identified as a giver.<br /><br />So am I a Giver or a Taker? I had an incident in my life, long ago and far away, where I went to work for a competitor of my company (a messenger service). This competitor was highly inefficient, and the word was that it would go under. So I visited the offices of their clients. Pretty much every client was unhappy, so without saying anything more I passed on info to my own company's salesmen, and they made several conversions - and paid me a small commission.<br /><br />Yet ten years later I was a volunteer with The Boston Computer Society, and I spent several years doing things like running classes on how to start a business in desktop publishing - the very business I was in myself. But my experience and reputation increased considerably, and eventually I was earning considerably more than I ever expected.<br /><br />So whatAdam Grant says is true. I suggest you read this book and form your own opinion. It may raise more questions than answers, but it will definitely make you think.Adam Grant says is true.

B004X75RCW|1.0|If a witless Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie is your cup of tea avoid The Proposal, unless you happen to enjoy Sandra Bullock.  I for one do and as such made it to the end.

B007REV4YI|3.0|The first 2 Craig Bond films were notable in their limitation of unnecessary and implausible action sequences.  If Skyfall is any indicator, the next Bond film will surpass Thunderball as the most absurd.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love all of the percy jackson books. They are really action filled and i have learned a lot about greek mythology! My favorite book is the lightning thief because that is when percy first gets introduced to evrything. Percy annabeth and tyson are my favorite characters.
B00BSBY38A|1.0|There is only so much one can take of a skinny kid fending off a computer generated (CG) tiger with a stick over the course of what seems days lost in front of your TV.  The story is told at a second grade level, and never really gets below the surface of the CG ocean it plies.  The punch line at the end is so without merit I would suggest you go to a spoiler site, read about it and then move on.
B008220C38|2.0|I like most movies for this time period; however, I did not like the set up this as a play of sorts.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I got this Kindle edition at a special $5 price for the Trilogy, so even though I had already read this series in print format a few years ago, I jumped on this offer and decided to reread it in advance of the new Catching Fire movie premiere.  So glad to have it on the Kindle.....Thanks so much for the great price!!!!
B0068FYZ84|4.0|My husband loves this movie and the whole family enjoys it from time to time.  So glad we finally got it.
B00C1DR9FS|5.0|OneRepublic has the Midas Touch.  This album is just magic.  Solid beats, haunting medleys, unique vocals.  Exactly what we've come to expect from OneRepublic, but on the next level.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a fun game with a lot of different options to choose from. I like that you are able to play both sides of the game as well.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I guess this was one of those movies that was over my head.  It was the worst movie I have seen in years.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Book is based on a neat idea, but the plot develops haphazardly. Writing isn't terrible but also is not great.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I especially love the 80's music videos from the day when they first became hugely popular on cable TV.  Vevo allows me the joy of revisiting most all those videos, or other genres of music video since it automatically customizes subsequent selections to fit one's taste.  For instance, if someone picks Lenny Kravitz for instance, all following videos that Vevo loads will be of a similar musical style until the user changes it.  Nice!

B00APJLY0Q|5.0|This movie is a favorite in our household.  Having it on my Kindle Fire HD ensures there are no arguments over what is played on TV.  The story is interesting (even for an adult) that is well-written and produced.  Happy to have downloaded this one since I do not clutter up my Kindle Fire HD with downloaded content as a rule.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The Facebook app is the best app ever made. It is so easy to use. Just one touch and you are on your Facebook!!! :)
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Having this app on my Kindle Fire HD keeps me abreast of job opportunities that interest me, anywhere I am.  It is an essential tool, and one worth having.  At least this professional social-networking site is not a parody of itself.  Truly real and awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition). I find myself and kids playing this app for hours. It is so much fun!!! :)
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Anyone taking a math course or needing a cryptic password generated needs this app.  There is so much more that it can do that I have yet to explore, but you can call this the portable intelligence a user can truly benefit from.  Not to repeat myself, but this app is an intelligent choice to download...but I repeat myself.
B008FERHV8|5.0|I like movies with 'hard' southern women. Those that are ragged around the edges and don't take crap from anyone. This movie is full of women like this. It's a well told story, set in a rural, closed, country community, with strong acting throughout. This movie shows us that even in the most peaceful, out of the mainstream places, turmoil silently boils just below the surface. A movie not to be missed!
B0037QGS0A|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was very suspenseful and really kept my attention from beginning to end. It is worth having in your DVD collection.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Daniel Craig and Judi Dench are great.  Rest of film is not as engaging as other Bond films but acceptable.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The main characters are Travis and Abby (pigeon). Travis is the typical player and he fights in a underground \\"fight circle\\". He is automatically drawn to Abby especially since she turns him down. They become best friends but the two fight like crazy because they both want more. There were parts I wanted to beat the crap out of Travis. He was a douche at times but still loveable. Abby has secrets from her past she tries to keep hidden but is found out by Travis. And they definitely are not your typical secrets. Travis fights a lot in and out of the \\"circle\\". Mostly over Abby. The supporting characters are awesome. I loved it. If you can get into jealous guys who are covered in tattoos and can beat the crap out of everyone then this is the book for you. There wasn't much I didn't like about it and it would give too much away if I shared the main part I didn't like. And the fact that it ended. I hated that part.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Found it to be paced well.  The costuming and settings were all accurate for the time period.  The music was good too.
B00BEJ5O6Q|2.0|Blake Shelton<br />\\"Based On A True Story...\\"<br />(Warner Brothers, 2013)<br /><br />Honestly, I hadn't paid much to the tempest-in-a-teapot kerfuffle where Blake Shelton said in an interview that the whole keep-country-real crowd were out-of-touch fogies and that \\"nobody wants to listen to their grandpa's music,\\" thereby ticking off legions of old fogies who thought he was disrespecting country tradition. Anyway, I wasn't that worried about it, but the brouhaha did come to mind when I heard Shelton's new album, which he opens with a song where he loudly proclaims how he and the good ol' boys he runs with \\"don't take no s---!!\\" This kind of took me by surprise since I'm of a generation that doesn't expect unvarnished profanities in top country albums. Also, it's the second time this week I've heard the s-word on a Top 40 country album... Later on, Shelton brags about flipping the bird on \\"I've Still Got A Finger,\\" and talks smack on several other songs.<br /><br />I guess being vulgar is \\"in\\" in Nashville these days, with singers going all HBO all of a sudden, but frankly I think it's kind of lame. I'm not a big prude or anything, but I don't think this is a good development. I think the new trend is a way for country dudes to up the ante on the macho, tough-guy songs but if this kind of language is on an album by a super-mainstream artist, it's way more likely to be heard by little kids, which I'm not really that into. There are some gal-friendly power ballads, too, but all the macho songs sort of cancel them out, or at least feel like they're part of some completely different record. And I guess maybe the old coots have a point: Maybe Blake Shelton isn't really keeping it country, after all. (Axton)
B00BF11STU|3.0|Interesting from a historical point of veiw but for entertainment value it was just okay. That was the opinion of myself and others that watched ranging in age from 19 to 57.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just as great as the other books! I loved it! I hope they make another one! Definitely recommend the trilogy
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun App, just hard to make money and get into competitions.  I wish they would allow you to groom your horse yourself.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|This is a wonderfully suspenseful series with two great actors. The storylines as well as the interactions between Sherlock and Watson are intriguing and entertaining. Episode one will get you hooked.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I saw parts of this series when it run on TV, so It's great catching up on episodes I missed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think the book is great. Excited to read the next one. I bet it's as great or even better
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|Abbey Road has been one of my preferred Beatles albums for many years.<br />I am very happy to have this in vinyl format. It has great sound depth and quality and it is a pleasure to listen to it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When ever I enter it says unauthorized request! Please help someone!<br />I have put so much effort into my world's!
B00BPLDCVM|3.0|The songs were great. My only complaint is that the theme song is a remix version that does not sound anything like the actual song. That's one of the best parts of the show. The remix version was unnecessary.
B00005R24K|3.0|OK early zombie movie, but really not up to par IMHO given some of the more effusive ratings given to this film.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This was a very good DVD. I love it. I recomend it to every music lover. (eye opening).<br />Very nice
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Mir macht das Spiel sehr viel Spaß. Man kann das Pferd pflegen,trainieren,Turniere reiten. Die Grafik ist für ein kostenloses Spiel auch sehr gut.
0061733199|5.0|I'm glad I purchased this book. I thought it would be a small pocket size book but was surprised to find out that it's just the right size, a little bigger than an ordinary pocket book. No regrets, this will come in handy soon!
B00063F8B2|5.0|Wonderful cd.  Grandkids were surprised when cd arrived and loved listening to the cd.  Would recommend the cd to others.
B008Y212PI|4.0|These little PUZZLES are fun and CHALLENGING. THEY'Re kind of addictive. I can't stop playing. They're fun to play more than once too! I recommend them.
B000R34V50|5.0|I have always liked Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Reminds me of part of my childhood and this was a good throwback movie.
B0096HL33G|2.0|This story that has been told before in other films.  If film was trying to build on viewers emotions of primary characters, it was way too slow in achieving.
B00AJLHULW|5.0|Super Musical - 100% about the song!  His voice, the musicianship, great production, this CD is a slam dunk for Robben and his fans!
B0040GWKDK|5.0|Love the album. Great go to list for a run down memory lane. Took the kids out for ice cream the other night and all they keep asking for is that \\"spirit in the night song\\". Take that lady gaga.... :)
B009H5IS1W|5.0|the best ive watch n have all seasons I love watching everyday im addicted to the show I love it
B007HACDLK|4.0|As always, Flynn presented a great read that kept me captivated.  I only gave it 4 stars because it got a little too predictable towards the end.
B0015DROBO|5.0|THIS is the BEST BOOK EVER!!!! You will fall in love w/ Lisbeth or just want to be her...FANTASTIC READ~
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thus book is awesome. There is happiness, tradegy, and sadness. Everyone should read it. Please dont hate this book<br /><br />The end
B00004XQ83|1.0|This was NOT as advertised. It skips and stops and starts and the end of the last song is missing. I'll not make this mistake again.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I found a ton of negatives and slides that I wanted to develop. Went to a store to get it done and they wanted to charge me over $1000. I had a lot of film! So I went searching for alternatives and came across this. For $90 or so, I was able to develop all of the pictures. The quality is solid and it's quick and easy. I would recommend it if you are in a similar situation or if you have yet to move into the 21st century and still use film instead of a digital camera.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|But it was awesome. It's better than the show with all it's added-for-HBO-viewers fluff. The show is a great visual addition to the book, but the book is fantastic. Full
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|This offering from Bowie has received a lot of attention and so I purchased the cd. I find the whole cd to be 2nd and 3rd. rate offerings. Bowie's voice is mixed way down simply because it's a rasp and the flaccid production by Tony Visconti is vastly over-rated.<br /><br />The whole record sounds the same, is uninspired, and is filled with Bowie-isms and Bowie cliches.<br /><br />Earl Slick offers some good guitar parts but they are buried in the mix.<br /><br />Bland and inoffensive, this outing by the great Bowie is the emperor's new clothes.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|Yeah, I'm and adult and I watch cartoon movies some of the time. This one was just too much for the kids to be enjoyable for an \\"adult\\" mind. I think kids will like it a lot, although it might be scary for very young kids.
B003MAQLVM|5.0|Overall, the movie was a good one, but the best scene in the movie was intro with Nightcrawler.  I wish they gave him more fight scenes in the movie.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Each case is a law lesson. Probably not accurate but interesting how deals are negotiated. I hope to keep enjoying it.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This cd is great so I don't know if it  had something to do with how I liked the border but I did get it within the time it said it would.
B0081336FO|3.0|Interesting series the actors are intense and involved in their characters, directing and development not as serious as the actors
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I'm going to miss Dr. Bishop sooo much!  This show was totally innovative, interesting, and had characters that connected so well. They had great interactions and the acting was fantastic. I will miss seeing Dr. Bishop's genius.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Gripping, humorous, tragic and enlightening. Chris Kyle's story is a must-read! His sacrifice, along with the other men and women of the Armed Forces, is an inspiration to all. My deepest thanks for all their service.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This first book of the trilogy had a great storyline by itself but it does leaving you wanting to know what happens next.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Had me right from the beginning with the first song...&#34;Boys' Round Here.&#34; As I continued to listen, I realized I had to have the whole CD. He can tell a great story through music and this CD has everything for up tempo songs with attitude to ballads that will melt your heart. Men and women both will find their favorites but will love to listing to them all. It's almost like you get a glimpse of Blake's life and the simple things that are important to him like in the last song... &#34;Granddaddies Gun.&#34; Great songs, great singer, great performer and a great asset to the world of country music. He can charm your socks off with a few words set to music. I just LOVE it and think you will too ;)
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|I've owned every bad religion album at one point in time, and have always enjoyed them as a band, and artists. They were one of the most influential bands of my youth, and I couldn't imagine never having listened to them. This album didn't disappoint me, and actually reminded me of a lot of their way older stuff. If you are a Bad religion fan, or even someone only slightly a fan of Bad Religion, I highly recommend this album.

B0011Z31V8|5.0|Good stuff! Never skipped a song. This is a great Prince compilation. Best I've seen. I'm loving it. Get this album!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|If you like Joe Walsh, you have to get this CD!  Great album/cd and I really like the song, Analog Man...it's one of those songs that you can play over and over...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Love Downton Abbey....such a quality production....love the characters and the scenic background.  Can't wait for Season 4! I own copies of the first 3 DVD's.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|First off, I will admit I am not a big fan of Mr. Timberlake. But over the years I have seen his career grown from strength to strength from his days with N'Sync to his solo career, producing an album for Madonna and even acting. And it is clear that Justin is here to stay cause he has proven he is beyond a teen idol. Justin appears to be a perfectionist at whatever he does and he puts his all into it and this album is no exception.<br />It is many things at the same time:<br />It has a polished, modern day, Motown  Hybrid sound.<br />It is groovy and soulful.<br />It is a very mature sound, but at the same time still able to sound very fresh.<br />Each song is a musical rollercoaster designed to thrill the listener.<br />And over it is the soaring vocals of JT, up front and clear.<br />It is an instance classic.<br />It is all these things at the same time, but does not take away from the music it only adds to the complete 20/20 experience.<br /><br />It is different from his first two albums, the only sound that is a throw back to the last album is Mirrors.<br />I am sure that every time I listen to this album I will hear something new in it.<br />This is truly worth sitting and listening to and just enjoy this musical ride and see where it takes you.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Not my kind of book,but once I started to read it couldn't put it down.  Very happy I bought it
B000IMUYJM|5.0|This movie is worth owning, it is truly scary to this day. What I like about it is they don't show a bunch of gore. They rely on acting to make it suspenseful.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|The simple, research supported concepts in this book surprised me.  Not because they were revolutionary, but because they were so common sense.  I was surprised just how good this book was.  I'm looking forward to periodically rereading this book.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Great game! New age spacey relaxing and fun:) Good way to unwind or kill some time. For the best experience play with headphones or earbuds.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Hadn't seen this in ages.  It is a great movie with a good deal of symbolism and social theory/criticism in it.  While watching it, you must also remember that this movie, at the time it was made, used the most up-to-date technology to make it appear to be the year 2274, including the first use of holograms in a film.  Love it...5 stars from me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A game like this for free what a steal get it I promise you won't be disappointed robin is the best and never disappoint.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I Loved defending Jacob.  The author Makes you think. I Love the way that it was written. It has a Great ending
B0095P29EG|5.0|Didn't think they could pull Thor off so well, but Marvel studios has yet to do wrong. Fingers crossed it stays this way!
B00ARF92HK|4.0|This is so much better than the tired fare that has come down the pike.  Good old fashioned shoot-em-up without being preachy.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this series, but this one especially because this book is where it all starts to change. Especially with Daenerys. She becomes more like a queen and her personality gets stronger. Shes not that shy little girl she was when she met Drogo.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I did not think I was going to like this movie, but I was captivated.  I find that I cannot stop thinking about the story.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I still reflect upon this story from time to time.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The story may be fiction but the true surrounding history has never been described better! I have never felt the real chilling truth about the situations at the time. It provides a complete new look at people and nations tumbling into history they thought they would control. The 2nd world war was taught in school but I was never able to comprehend of how people could have been manipulated until it was too late. Ken Follett is doing an amazing job in describing how the horror unfolded! This book (as well as the first!) is a must read! Well done and can't wait for the third book!
B00BHMF578|3.0|Very little suspense and no intrigue.  I was never invested in anything but the story, and knowing the story leaves you with nothing else.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|Very creative and original album by The Strokes. Mature, different, and so listenable. I love it. The major music zines are legit crazy with the negativity regarding this album. Its easily the most interesting, laid back, and groovy of all their albums. And the musicianship is outstanding. On my 10th listen. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed at all.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very moving.  I couldn't help but think about all the women going through a similar situation in real life.  This book really made me think.  I would highly recommend it.
B002U1F32M|4.0|This film has to be one of the most realistic take on relationships I've ever seen. Beautifully directed, with an amazing soundtrack. Zooey Deschanel is wonderful as Summer, and she will break your heart as she broke Tom's.
0425263916|5.0|Definitely kept my attention, great addition/continuation from Bared to you.  I cant wait for book three to come out.  I think it will be great as well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn writes a cautionary tale aimed at the lover seeking that one in a million partner, that woman, or man who knows one completely. Reading Gone Girl I've learned that one should never turn one's back on one's soulmate.
B009LDMJBU|5.0|one of the best of many cd's by Eros Ramazzotti, I loved it!<br />Eros is one of my favorite singers, The &#34;Noi&#34; cd is pure gold!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The narration through the eyes of a young woman seduced at first by an aging professor, once a spy for one of the MI's, is deeply engaging. She seems cursed by beauty and a love of fiction. She attracts men who use her, even as she seems to be using them. The revelation of the profound corruptions attending episodes of romantic love touched my pessimistic heart. There's nothing much sweet about the teeth that rend the life of the heroine.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is an amazing app. I recommend everybody to download this app. This app is easier than temple run, but it is still amazing.
174179918X|2.0|I've lived in Korea for nearly 2 years now and having relocated throughout the country several times (Gwangju, Seoul, now Busan) I've seen and done a lot here but what makes Korea great is there's always TONS of new things to do.  I lost my previous copy of Lonely Planet in a move so I decided to buy this new edition instead of borrow the old edition from any of my friends here.  I thought I'd see more info, more pictures, better insight, updated info, etc.  This book is missing so many things from cities outside of Seoul.<br /><br />It also seems nearly identical in terms of information and the suggestions are rather questionable at times.  For instance, their recommended itineraries are impossible to achieve.  They suggest making 15 stops throughout Seoul, Gangwon-do, Busan, Jeju-do, etc. in 2 WEEKS! Another 2-week itinerary has 22 stops!  I understand you don't have to do it all, but why recommend this specific itinerary then?  Could they not really make a reasonable itinerary for uninformed tourists?  Also, ranking the Mud Festival as the #3 thing you must do while going to the DMZ is way down at #13 is just plain silly.  These sorts of things really show a lack of expertise on Korea they supposedly have.<br /><br />I feel like they should add a section for western restaurants and foreigner bars too.  It's easy to find great Korean food in Korea.  But since most foreigners to Korea are ESL teachers living on yearly contracts (or military) and finding good western food can be really difficult in many places, I feel like they should at least add a section dedicated to finding these things. I find better info on stuff like this online than in LP.  I understand LP wants to keep it more culturally relevant but adding a section dedicated to expats or western places would be awesome.<br /><br />The book is somehow shorter too.  If they had really taken the time to be well acquainted with Korea there would be vastly better info and more recommendations instead of this short book.  I feel like cities like most cities outside Seoul have been shortchanged. I noticed the 4-5 editors that have worked on this edition have all only visited Korea for short periods and they all seem to have more experience living in Japan or Singapore.  Can LP really not get a good expat writer living in Korea?<br /><br />The book still has good info for a newbie tourist or expat though overall and at the Amazon price of $17 it's good (relatively).  However, don't buy this if you already have the old edition or if you can get the old edition for cheap.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I ran across this mouse by accident and I saw the price. I was a little nervous going with a newer brand, but I definitely made the right decision. It has 9 programmable buttons that are perfect for gaming and they are all in good spots where the fingers can reach them fairly effortlessly. I do not care about lighting effects much, but that was just a added bonus. I have had the mouse for about three weeks now and it has never failed me. The button for changing your settings is on the bottom which is kind of weird, but it really is no big deal. I am very impressed with this product and I would buy another one for my laptop.
1400069289|5.0|This book not only shares anecdotes about the uses of habit to manipulate buyers, it suggests ways that we can use habits to better our lives. I love the sociological implications, as scary as they are, and just hope that I can put some of the personal keys to use in my own life.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved reading this book. It is sensitive, realistic, beautifully written. I definitely recommend this book a a great summer reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins does not disappoint in this final book of The Hunger Games trilogy. Filled with suspense, action and enough warm affectionate moments that you can't help but love the characters.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|This show is amazingly well written.  Dark, humerous, serious all at the same time.  I am captivated by it and love the depth of development of each character as the seasons go on.  I would highly recommend this season but only after you have seen the first 2!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app.  It's a no fuss easy-to-use calculator that works well.  I use it for quick calculations for school and personal finance.  Download it now.
B003CHGV74|5.0|Season 2 is more of the great writing and drama of season 1.  Frankly, I don't know how anyone could stop after seeing Season 1 of this show.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Hilarious movie. Have seen it five times and LMAO every time I watch it. Great concept. Can't wait for Ted 2. Special features worth it.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Well worth the price, this show is extremely well written.  It is a dark comedy and drama at the same time and achieves both with equal success.  Highly recommend it.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Get story of personal “preference” with a good storyline incorporating proof of God, and the power of storytelling.<br /><br />I like the movie so much I've went out to buy the DVD so that I could watch it over and over again as well as share it with friends.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|My sister recommended this movie to me and now I recommend it to everyone else.  A tender story about friendship that made me laugh & cry.  Although in subtitles, you don't even notice and it's not annoying.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played it and you should by it its way better than the first one it has new obstacles like a zip line and mine carts and much more! You can even buy other people instead of just one for money in the game.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Not quite as good as Enya's other albums.  Some of these songs just don't &#34;sound&#34; like Enya's voice that I just love.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My wife got a Kindle and plays all the time more than reading her books. Shes better than I am
B00000J0O2|1.0|In HP packaging but it printed 10 pages and then ran out. Awful, will never order again. Demand Refund. I am skeptical that this was a real HP product.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Its great alot of his best hits with out a lot of filler songs on a CD listen all the time
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I enjoyed every word. I cannot wait for what comes next! The fate of the kingdoms is threatened, without knowing what happens to all.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|The title is a bit of a mystery because it isn't just one of Thompson's incredible Fender workouts for the entire disc.  Rather it's a collection of excellent songs and performances by somebody who has been doing that for almost half a century.  One thing that makes it unique is that it was recorded in Buddy Miller's home studio which gives it, in Thompson's words, a &#34;slightly trashy sound&#34;.  There's nothing surprising here as far as the types of songs included; they're all in the same vein that Thompson has successfully mined for his entire career.  But that's not meant to take away from the quality of them because they're all thoughtfully conceived and executed with Thompson's rich voice on display along with his jaw-dropping guitar technique.<br /><br />The bonus disc provides some additional songs from the session that make you wonder why they didn't make the cut for being included on the main disc.  There are also three songs from two different settings which are equally well done, although the sound is different due to the changed setting.
B0093LINVK|5.0|I love this little computer!  I bought two of them.  I needed a small, quite, energy efficient PC that could play HD videos and interlaced TV.  I was so close to just building my own when I came across this.<br /><br />I bought a single 4GB stick of Patriot RAM, and a Cruzer 8 GB flash drive.  I run openELEC (XBMC) off of a USB drive on my NUC.  This little box can do it all.  The HD4000 graphics so far haven't given me any issues.<br /><br />I stream full 30GB MKV rips of Blu Rays from an unRAID NAS and it plays them without breaking a sweat.  I also have a MythTV server that streams live  TV to it, and again, it handles it all just fine.  The picture quality is great.  No stuttering.  I run the Aeon NOX skin, which is kind of heavy.  It is very fast even with the Aeon skin and most of the widgets enabled, this is from running off a USB.  I'm sure it would just scream with a mSATA drive.<br /><br />I can't think of another box that does everything this box does.  Sure there are cheaper ones out from Foxconn and Zotac.  With the NUC you get a more attractive box IMO, an intel motherboard, and i3 and HD4000 graphics, gigE, and a fantastically small form factor.  I just love it.  This is my main TV viewing box.  All of our media needs go through XBMC.  We use this just like someone would use a cable box, or a DirecTV box.  It's very important to us that it be reliable, and fast.  I don't want to be reminded that I'm watching TV on a computer.  I don't with this.  It's so fast and smooth with the openELEC OS and XBMC.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This movie kept me interested and engaged through the entire movie.  It was well acted and well directed with a good deal of suspence.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|It has been quite since I have read this book  but am very pleased to say that I was not dismayed by it and liked it as well now as then. The Old English in it is a delight to read for me, being someone who spent their formative years among people who spoke thus. I readily vouch for reading is this book. It is never wrong to broaden the mind by reading good works.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is no joke. It kicked my butt! I never could make it past level two! But I still definitely seen definition towards the end of the thirty days.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Another Kate Bigelow Academy Award winner.  It would of swept the awards had it not been for ARGO.<br />Not for everyone but for news junkies it's a masterpiece.
1449410243|4.0|First, yes, this book has some language.  You could likely look at the title of the book and figure that out.  I'm good with it.  I have a sailor's mouth, myself.<br /><br />This is a GREAT conversation piece/coffee table book.  Guests are a little afraid to ask if I really think my cat is plotting to kill me, or if it's a joke.  I just don't say anything and let them think what they want.  Awesome book!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A truly extraordinary experience filled with exceptional insights. Whether one accepts life and consciousness beyond science this is a book that should not be dismissed without serious and deep consideration.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was talked into this one by my sister and nephew; glad they did. I love history and good drama and Downton (not &#34;Downtown&#34;) Abbey is both. The relationships and characters appear true-to-life and appealing. Scenarios are fraught with drama. Acting, setting (what an awesome - and real - castle), writing are first-class. I love history when represented accurately and this series places the viewer there.<br /><br />(BTW, the real life owner of the castle/home during this period was the Earl of Carnarvon - portrayed in this series as the Earl of Grantham - who funded and personally participated in the archeological expedition that discovered King Tut's tomb.)
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I'm not going to go through and review all seven seasons. Here is the straight dope:<br /><br />First episode: Amazing!<br /><br />First season: Fantastic! 5 Stars!<br /><br />Second season: Very Good. 4 stars. Definitely lagged behind the first season, but well worth watching.<br /><br />Third season and on: Increasingly more awesome! Call them all 4 increasing to 5 stars. Seriously, as this show went on, it got better and better until it culminated into the best Series Finale I have ever seen. The show ended exactly the way it should have. That's all I'm going to say.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was such a beautifully written book.. a story of struggles and triumphs. I loved the connection with different flowers and their meanings and how these flowers influenced people's lives. A truly mesmerizing book.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Get. This. App. Right. NOW. It is the best app I have ever played. I play this game daily. If you don't get this app, wow, there are no words to say what you are missing out. Reef, Mako, Hammerhead, Tiger, Great White Shark. B. E. S. T. A. P. P. E. V. E. R. BEST. APP. EVER. BEST APP EVER. BEST APP EEVVEERRR. BBEESSTT AAPPPP EEEVVVEEERRRR!!!!!!!!! So, If you don't get this app, you are an idiot. It doesn't even cost anything! So just get the app.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Life of Pi had a great dreamlike quality that drew you in to the scene. The animations were lifelike but more beautiful. The movie had a good storyline and all in all a very watchable movie. Much more entertaining than Argo that won the Oscar for best movie.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I watched this online half a million times and wanted my own copy to watch a million times more.  Loaned it to a friend and have not seen it since.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|WOW . What a lovely and touching movie. Helen Hunt is outstanding on her acting as a therapist. The actor in the iron lund had a lot to learn to adjust to his part. I would watch this movie several times again.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I have watched this movie a million times.  It is so joyful and bright.  I live that it has several different story lines that intersect in weird and wild ways.  I watch this to kick off the Christmas holidays or whenever I need to smile.
B005IQZB14|4.0|It was different from most books I read.  I liked the idea of a hike but thought she should have thought things through a little better before taking on such a feat.
B000683VI4|5.0|I bought the book as part of my Aphasia Book Club.  We read the book as a group over 6 weeks and watched the movie at the end of the reading.  The group loved the entire experience and the movie capped the experience for them.
B0013LPS6Q|5.0|Considering U2's rich body of work, it would be easy to dismiss their debut album, \\"Boy\\", as nothing more than a highly spirited indication of things to come for a band in their late teens/early 20's.<br /><br />True, U2 would go on to bigger, more ambitious and chart-topping music, but it would be a mistake to overlook the surprisingly well-developed musicianship of Boy. There is not a weak song on the album. The melodies and hooks are there and instantly memorable in each song, set amidst searing post-punk guitar work by The Edge and a highly energetic rhythm section led by Larry Mullen Jr.<br /><br />\\"I Will Follow\\" remains a U2 classic and live staple to this day, but there are numerous other songs which (sadly) have become overlooked over the years, including \\"Out of Control\\", \\"Stories For Boys\\", \\"Electric Co.\\", \\"An Cat Dubh\\" and \\"A Day Without Me\\". The rest of the album is high energy, memorable, and instantly endearing; \\"The Ocean\\" also gives a little taste of U2's more surreal and atmospheric side which they would explore in later albums.<br /><br />It's also refreshing to hear a young U2 not yet caught up in the trappings of feeling the need to be rock music's conscience - the political statements of later years was not yet present. There is a blissful sense of little self-awareness in Boy that is so easy to appreciate and makes the album a joy to listen to.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I loved Julia Child and this movie is an homage to her.  Great performances throughout.  Meryl Streep is great as usual, but so is Stanley Tucci.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I like it, will you? I do not know but if you can't be bothered to download something for free then don't bother downloading it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book. I stayed up until past 2am on several work nights (when I should have been sleeping) because I just couldn't put it down.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Don't really care about ads popping up, after a min or so they seem to stop. I don't think by me not paying for their app I'm missing anything and I'm sure they are not missing a meal but do what you want.
B005OK725M|4.0|You get what you expect a sexy chick kicking ass and taking names later. I think it would've been something special if tarantino had directed it though. All in all a good popcorn flick.
B00969PR18|1.0|Did not really care for it but download it and figure out for yourself if you want it or not. If a review of a free app stops you from downloading it then you really didn't care to try it anyway
B007WV05GY|5.0|This movie is an incredible action thriller starring the always great Liam Neeson. The audio effects within the first 15 minutes made me think I'll never experience something as realistic as this without actually being IN a plane crash! The acting and suspense are incredible, and it goes into the five stages associated with dying. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for an edge of your seat thriller. Just be sure to have someone to grab on to when you watch it, if you're someone that needs that. This one will have you white-knuckled for a large portion of the film. Buy, watch, enjoy!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Couldnt put it down!! Great story about Early Onset Alzheimers.  Very enlightening read. Loved it.  Looking forward to reading more of Genova's novels.
B00BMVTS1S|2.0|Special effects were good but the story add ins were horrible. The albino ork? Really? I wanted to have an open mind on this but who sucked the soul out of the story?<br />I hope the next one proves to be more worthy of the reputation of this book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Read it. Words will not bring justice to this work of art. This truly is an amazing piece of literature.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great action and exciting scenes. Some interesting things learned in this movie but will not mention them for those who have not seen it. I will watch it again to be sure I didn't miss anything.  Great sound!!
B0095P31L6|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  I watched it with my kids and wife.  We all loved it.  I has nice twists and is funny.  One part/line that the kids and I (the wife not so much) thought was funny was about \\"missing mangos\\".  To get the joke you have to watch.  But I am certain kids and parents will love this movie. It is great for laughs.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|But not as good as some of the previous John Corey stories.  I have read them all, and this one is probably my least favorite
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The book is very different from the movie. It's a little slow and I found myself skimming at times. But the characters are good.
B009K0P10K|4.0|It's a great series.  We watch 3 or 4 episodes at one seating.  Every time you think you have it figured out, there is a new twist.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was probably the best Kate Morton book I have read thus far.  I enjoyed her other works, but was usually a little disappointed in the endings.  Morton consistently kept me spellbound to the last page of 'The Secret Keeper.'
B00AA0U05A|4.0|I remembered her in the Phantom of the Opera and how beautiful she sang. So I decided to get her two CDs and give it a try. A lovely voice and wonderful actress.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|I don't understand some of the bad reviews for this movie, I loved it! Its not realistic, its not supposed to be. Have you ever watched movies like Ghost Hunters and wished something would JUST HAPPEN. Well this movie is it and its over-the-top. Things happen and they happen regularly and increase in intensity. I watch this movie over and over. One of the better documentary horror movies.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I got this alarm clock so when I travel it would be useful. If you want song on this you have to upgrade. When you are using it. You have to plug in your kindle so the battery won't run down. If you want something simple this is the way to go. If you want more than you have to pay the price for the product. It should have more features but to have that you have to upgrade. To me its not worth it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I loved this movie.  Denzel proved that he just gets better with age! The way he flew that plane was just so amazing...his acting was truly superb!! I would have given it 5 stars but the ending left me wanting more...
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is one app that actually allows you to download from YouTube. A nice touch is the ability to select the video resolution and format.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Moran manages to make Feminism look fun. Thought there are obviously things that she is outraged about, this doesn't read like some angry manifesto. It's some good PR for a movement that is misunderstood by so many. Every 13 year old girl should be given a copy, which she is then made to read once a year.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|I know this was a best selling book, but I found the movie to be a little slow in some parts.  It also reminded me too much of the movie Castaway.  The animals were very believable and did not appear fake at all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book. It gave a very good interpretation on the minds of dogs. Sad, funny, and inspiring.  Good read for anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and read it in one sitting.  The price was much cheaper than the actual book.  I can not wait to read the last in the series.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Got this book because of Harry Bosch and how he solves the case.  If you're new to Harry you might do better starting with some of his earlier crime solving.  This started out OK but got long and winded and kind of boring.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book had me dreaming about it. While the subject matter was more violent than what I usually read, it wasn't terribly over the top. A good read. I couldn't put it down
B00006V9A0|4.0|One word describes this cd. Awesome!!!  Their music was great years ago and its great today. It may be a bit dated,but its still 'Classic'
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game. Nice puzzles that aren't unsolvable and good searches.  Graphics are good and the story is interesting. Highly recommended
1932100660|5.0|This book is the pinnacle of 30+ years of research in whole food plant based nutrition. If the study results in this book do not convince you that we can alleviate many of our diseases, aches, pains, and so forth by eating properly, then I don't know what will. The writing is technical and scientific, yet you cannot have a discussion about nutrition without this type of writing. This book will change your life.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Normally not into space invader-esque games, but this one is well put together.  Fun, and with no detectable bugs.  Really appreciate the short load times.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I remember the events of this when it happened, so the dramatization just kept it from being more of a boring documentary.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It was a free game so I got what I paid for! It's okay but kind of hard to follow.
B009FZFONO|4.0|The first two seasons were good and the 3rd ok, but in my opinion, the pace is moving a little too slow.
B00005614M|5.0|This is one of Miles Davis's best albums. The other being Bitches Brew. Just listen to it and you'll see why!
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Of course the book is always better, but the computer generated graphics of the scenery and graphics made this movie very worthwhile.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book.  A little different from other Sparks books.  Could have done without the last chapter twist but still great.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I am a person who suffers from an anxiety disorder at 20yrs old, and need something to relax me and this helps take the edge off and bring me to my center. If u need help sleeping or have anxiety too, then this app is right for you :)
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Needs work before it would be what I would call a good app and even more before I'd call it great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my young granddaughter plays this game every chance she gets,she loves it and it is very entertaining,the game is great fun.
B005V2S7FW|1.0|I uninstalled this almost as soon as I installed it  don't like anything about it so I can't recommend it.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I can't believe I've never seen this show before!  I love it.  My mom would have loved it!  It's a lot like Murder She Wrote only the guy is really HOT!<br />I can't believe it's in it's 5th season!  I got catching up to do!
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|I had high hopes, it was too long and repetitive. I thought the movie was going somewhere but...no such luck.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Took only a weekend to watch the first 2 seasons.  Can't believe I'd never heard of this show!  I hope it continues!
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Argo was so thrilling to watch.<br /><br />Plenty of action and suspense that made it very hard to look away. The fact the plot was \\"based\\" on a true story that was the \\"best bad idea of the lot\\" provided a comedic element to what was an incredibly tense global situation that if it failed could have led to a severe catastrophic response.<br /><br />Some tremendous acting, especially by the 6 \\"escapees\\" as they lived with the daily fear of disclosure. Affleck continues to improve as an actor and did marvellously considering he also was director.<br /><br />I so enjoyed going back to the late 70s/early 80s too with those haircuts, clothes and clunky cars.<br /><br />The tension of the final 15 minutes is great cinema.<br /><br />Thoroughly deserving of its Oscar.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I can't believe I missed 4 seasons of this show!  I hope there are many more to come!  It's an awesome suspensful show and funny!
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Rise of the Guardians is truly a hit, from start to finish. It has the feel of an instant classic, and truly will not disappoint!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I purchased this CD as a birthday gift for my sister.  She loves it! I was a little worried about it arriving on time, but the shipping was super-fast and it arrived a couple days early, which was fine.  She was really impressed, and so was I.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best of the three seasons by far.  It keeps the human character elements that made Season One and Season Two so powerful, but it picks up the pace and the action.  Almost every episode brings new dangers and challenges to the group.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It gets me going when I'm stressed I read this and it calms me down<br />I hope my Valentine's day dance doesn't turn out like this
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this game! I recommend this game to kids that like temple run.All of my friends play this is game.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great I get the most out of it.I love to Change the color.and being able to set notifications when it's dying and charging is awesome.
B003L77GH4|5.0|It adds a paranormal spin to the garden variety soap opera without going overboard. I genuinely enjoy watching it. I'm going to order another season.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Good game works great on my kindle. Recommended for all ages. If u like temple run,this is for u. I say it's better than temple run. But it's your opinion not mine.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Just plain handy to have so someone can find you or find your way.  Plus its free!!!  Download it now
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|The note sharing ability climax when your creating url. The odd converter will be great four final web shot with out sponsor ship peer pressure and the trunks can't stop the incorporation attachment of letting the shared invite to anchor from allowing other User to edit and view with making the book publicly shared. The email server should connect with user with out making the note book public.<br /><br />Public note book can be used to write movies, tag news for Twitter, or better yet coach children to read multiple social writing with hesitation.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|I've watched videos and read other books yet this one seem to be the clearest one for how to exactly start it up.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Considering the vast, rich history of the books and the world and characters created by George R.R. Martin, you have to give credit to all involved in the creation of the TV series. What they can't cover through dialog they try to include via the sets and costumes and props. It's a great adaptation of the novels worth watching.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love it, had a great time with this book, but you must read all the series.  Enjoy it as much as I did.
B005LAII94|3.0|Two best friends Chon (Taylor Kitsch), who is an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, and Ben (Aaron Johnson), who has a Berkeley degree in business and botany, make a lot of money growing high-quality marijuana in California. As in an old George Roy Hill movie, they are living a carefree lifestyle, both sleeping with the same woman known as \\"O\\" (Blake Lively), until a Mexican drug cartel led by Elena (Salma Hayek) moves in. Things get out of control. Body count mounts.<br /><br />\\"Savages\\" is one of those films that could have been shorter and better. This is supposed to be a darkly entertaining crime drama, and what you need in making one is good storytelling and interesting characters. You don't need flashy camerawork. You don't need Blake Lively's bland voiceover that goes on and on. The character of \\"O\\" and her back story is the least interesting part of the film.<br /><br />Chon and Ben are marginally better (at least they have something to do in the story), but the film is easily stolen by Benicio del Toro's bravura performance as the killer. John Travolta is a DEA agent Dennis. Emile Hirsch is a computer hacker. Both actors (especially Hirsch) are so underused.<br /><br />I simply don't know why Oliver Stone wanted to make this movie, which is neither thrilling nor funny enough. As for the ending that is far from satisfactory, it looks as if director just doesn't know what to do with it. Don't expect much from \\"Savages.\\" It is not a terrible movie. It is not great, either.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I FIND THAT FINDING SMALL OBJECTS A GOOD WAY TO KEEP THE MIND GOING. EVEN THE CHILDREN LOVE THIS GAME
B004N44SOI|5.0|This has got to be one of the best CDs around.  Nikki and the boys are amazing and I love every single song on here.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|my heart is racing looking for the next spot. I keep saying &quot;omg&quot;. everybody must be thinking I am nuts. its a good game.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I bought this for my son this morning so he could read it on his Kindle for a long car ride.  It was so good he already finished it.  First time I bought a book for the Kindle and it will not be the last.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It may not keep you riveted in the beginning, but it will grab you, bring you into the community, and keep you attentive to the last page.
B004SDEP38|4.0|Very limited features of the free edition do the trick to enable reading Office documents but not much beyond that. I am fine with encouraging customers to pay, but the fact is that there are very good free alternatives out there, so I will use this App for a while to fully and fairly assess what it does and what it doesn't do but may end up switching to something else.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Lots of fun, a very relaxing, yet still compelling game to play.  Doesn't take much to figure out the basic game play or functions of various obstacles, so you can very quickly begin working out strategies.  Enjoyable, interesting game!
B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana Krall is even better pianist than vocalist; put together with a great ensemble in a live venue the result is great listening.  The audio quality is great as well.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|This is some of the best classic rock that you will find.  It helped define an error in American music.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great mixture of personalities. Good syfy . Believable story lines far far away.<br />follows through with the Stargate journey successfully.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is easy to use. I like how it lets you see the previous calculations that you've done and lets you go back to them.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Uninspired.  Unoriginal.  Cookie cutter characters doing predictable boring things.  Paper thin plot that is a ripoff of a hundred other Arthurian tales.  Really sorry that I spent time and money on this one.  I won't ever buy another story written by this hack.
030758836X|5.0|Well written and a real page turner! I have had another Gillian Flynn book on my shelf, &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; for quite a while and will definitely ready it next.  Gillian is a very talented writer, and has definitely made it to my &#34;favorite author&#34; list.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great game for obsessive compulsives who have limitless hours to spend shifting tiles. Cute graphics and Zen setting for relaxation.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|If you love it you love it. Probably not for everyone. At 3 hours this is just one part one of a detailed retelling of a beloved classic.
B00BN4U6VA|4.0|Ed Harris is an excellent Beethoven (I imagine) and I think the film overall is good.  In his lifetime, Beethoven constantly complained about his copyists and publishers, but it is not inconceivable that he must have had at least one or two good copyists.  I think that the actual conductor of the Ninth's premier was a bona fide conductor who stood off to the side.  The orchestra had instructions to ignore Beethoven.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I have purchased two copies of every year of this series one for my son and one for my daughter as  Christmas gifts . They loves it.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof of Heaven  was written by a skydiving neurosurgeon.  I found out that much as I read the free sample.  I found it so intriguing that I just had to find out more.  I enjoyed Dr. Alexander's writing style and got interested in his story very quickly.  Not long after I got past the free first chapter, I started getting a little bored with all of the background information and almost decided to quit reading.  It quickly picked up again and I found myself not wanting to put it down.  This book is the account of his personal experience and I, for one, found it riveting.  Though not exactly the same, I had a similar experience through which the doctors fully expected that I would not survive.  Maybe that's why it hit so close to home.  My experience could not be classified as a NDE (near death experience) - you know, &#34;go into the light&#34; kind of stuff, but Dr. Alexander describes his as well as the NDEs of others and how it changed his perspective.  At times, this book read very much like a science fiction story and I questioned its validity (I'm pretty skeptical, you see); however, Alexander pulled me around very convincingly.  I was very sad to get to the last page of the book, and once I did, I understood why he had structured the book as he did.  Gee, all that uninteresting information about family details ended up being important after all.  This book was not written to convince the science community to abandon its scientific method, but more like to us ordinary Joes who are searching for answers and sometimes feel our faith is on shaky ground.  This book is masterfully written and takes you on a wonderous journey of hope.  And for you thriller fans, it even ends with a bit of a twist.  This is a &#34;must read&#34;.  Enjoy!
B0091REZMW|2.0|not happy i was suppose to get points for this game and did not get them.  who can I talk to about this problem
B0049J0CTM|5.0|My little girl watches this movie at least twice a week, if not more...  She's 2 1/2 and has lines memorized.  Loves the &#34;shishies&#34; and the vibrant colors of the characters.  Much rather her watch this than that annoying yellow sponge on Nickelodeon!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is the best game ever!!! it is just like temple run but more better and awesome characters!! you should download this game because it is so so so so so so awesome!! if you play or downloaded this game that means you are awesome, and cool!!???!!!!!!!!?????!!!$$$$$
0877180121|2.0|not what I was hoping for.  I love John Thompsons &#34;Teaching LIttle Fingers To Play&#34; and I was hoping that this book would have the same type of introdution to music, just designed for a little bit older audience.  It wasn't.  The introduction of new lessons, song choice, etc... left much to be desired.  I will be sticking with &#34;Teaching LIttle Fingers.&#34;  The only redeeming value that I was able to find was that they have a couple (literally) of drills / tests on staff reading that I will use for one or two of my students who seem to be struggling in that aspect.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I  love this app. I  have all  my books on it. I  would only change the background color.  the white hurts my eyes sometimes a  softer color would be better
B005HEPN06|5.0|Star trek next generation season 4 was just as captivating as ever lots of good episodes especially loved the Klingon empire episodes
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|Good movie, but not as comedic as  I expected.  It was more serious and based on the stressors of their marriage rather than the funny things that happen
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Very dark but intriguing.......having read Gone Girl I was excitied to read her former books.<br />I will read another of hers in the furture.
B002PQ7JME|5.0|Mazzy Star were playing dream pop before it had a name and was just called college rock or alternative. The songs are catchy and beautiful.<br />Hope Sandoval's voice is a mystery as she can sound hurt, cold and lazy all at once. David Roback's guitar compliments her voice perfectly. Some songs are heartbroken ballads like Give You My Lovin while others take a psychedelic trip like Ghost Highway and the title track, She hangs Brightly.<br />This album is a voyage and is worth listening to from start to finish. I bought it on cassette in 1990 and then later on CD but on vinyl it seems to have come home as the recording sounds just so lovely and warm.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a fun game.. Sure keeps one on their toes~!  I like it because you can change the looks of the player...<br />I would highly recommend this game...
B00BESM14U|5.0|this movie is now on the top of my list of favorite movies of all time. a must see, i guarantee it!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This was a great book, I think the sword of truth series is awesome and if you haven't bot them all go buy them.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Great story, great story telling. I story was compelling, held my attention throughout, a must read if your intreged my human nature and their social emotional behavior.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|At first I thought this game was going to be crappy and would get boring fast, but once I started playing I couldn't stop. It is very fun. If you enjoy tycoon type games, I recommend you get this game. The only thing frustrating me right now is that you have to be lvl 10 to enter the sea park.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|The Cd is great, every song is okay not a bad song in the bunch. I love his voice, he has real talent. He isa soulful and current, my kind of music.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't wait till the update comes out it will be amazing<br />There will be servers I love minecraft it will be vary fun
1589795474|3.0|It was helpful, but to repetive. The book did provide a level of direction in money management but nothing specific. The main message was to love like you have nothing much.
B0006B2A42|4.0|Hudson and Borgnine are superb in this cold war era film. Lots of intrigue and spy action leaving you to question even those you thought we're the &#34;good&#34; guys. Film gets better as the plots unfold to it's daring conclusion. Worth the time spent viewing.
1451695195|2.0|Much too hubristic and not believable.
