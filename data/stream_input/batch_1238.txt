B00506NRBS|5.0|What can I say? Anything You Want by Derek Sivers was a great read.   It was short, but I got a few good ideas, and a few great reminders for what I can do to improve what I'm doing, such as remembering that it's about being, not having. It's not the stuff that will make you happy, nor the accomplishments, but how you feel right now.  I'd recommend this book to anyone, but it's not for everyone. This book is about doing what you love, not maximizing profit.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|My adult daughter wanted this dvd and as her doting mom I got it for her. All Disney movies are classics and can be watched again and again no matter what your age is.
B00535RUV4|4.0|I really like this album a lot. \\"Coming Up\\" is easily one of my favorite Paul McCartney songs, and some of the others rank very high for me as well (\\"Nobody Knows,\\" \\"Waterfalls,\\" \\"One of These Days\\"). The songs have a DIY feel, like the first McCartney album, so this one is appropriately named, even though this one relies more on synths than the ramshackle acoustic approach of the first one.<br /><br />If the songs were a little more fleshed out, I think this one could have been an even greater accomplishment, but, though it's part of this album's charm, it's also it's greatest drawback: some of the songs feel more like sketches, or larks, than fully realized compositions. \\"Temporary Secretary\\" is particularly noticeable in this regard. (My wife calls this song torture. It amuses me to some degree, but I see where she's coming from. I can understand why someone might find it completely irritating.)<br /><br />Since I already owned the CD, I downloaded this album for the bonus materials, and I'm glad I did. The whole album practically feels like bonus songs anyway, so, more than with other albums, I was very interested in hearing the outtakes here.<br /><br />To me, McCartney II and Tug of War are an oasis of great music between some of the lesser work by an artist who had created amazing music in the '60s and much of the '70s, then again starting in the mid-'90s through to the present. It's not perfect, but I definitely think it's worth having, and this reissue just adds to the enjoyment.
0062101897|5.0|This is siriusly the best thing I've gotten in a long time.  The moment I got it I freaked out with excitement.  It has so many awesome pictures, never before seen interviews, and it's extremely interesting to read about how it started off as a barely known book to this world phenomenon.  I would definitely recommend getting it to any HP fan.  It's absolutely amazing-- have fun!
B00466HN86|5.0|None of the theaters in the U.P. of MI planned to show Courageous.  When I returned from seeing it in Minnesota, it had done so well at the box office that it was/is at a nearby theater!  I do not cry easily, but I cried more throughout this film than any other (and heard the sobs of others around me every time).  Something else I've never experienced at a movie was the spontaneous applause that broke out at the end of the film, causing me to unhesitatingly join the rest of the applauding audience.  So many hard-hitting issues were addressed in this film besides probably the most important: being the best father you can be -- honesty in the workplace, the mistake of choosing sports on TV (or TV in general) over quality moments with your child, etc.  I've loved and shared all the Kendrick brothers' films, but Courageous has the most important message America needs to hear right now, \\"turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers.\\"
B0053YGYO4|3.0|By Coldplay standards this is just OK.  There's some songs that are classic Coldplay and pretty good (Hurts Like Heaven, Us Against the World).  And there's some songs that are just terrible (Princess of China).  Why oh why did they perform with Rihanna?  She's good at what she does, and Coldplay is good at what they do.  But the combination is bad.  The song sounds just as bad as all the others on your local pop radio station.  Of their 5 studio albums I would say this is my least favorite (keeping in mind that I've only owned it for a few days).  Maybe some of the other songs will grow on me, but as it stands now this is an OK album with some good mixed in with some bad.
B00164KYV4|4.0|It is a lovely movie to see with your friends (preferable girls, so you can talk, analyze and enjoy it). There are many stories; many personages that you really feel you can \\"connect\\" with one or maybe more characters. I am glad of my purchase, I just received it and watched it twice.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Fabulous album. I love all the tracks. We saw them at the Moody Center the night before they played Austin City Limits this past September and they played several of the new songs that night. If you haven't seen them live, you really ought to make a point to catch them. You won't be sorry. I've listened to this album multiple times and I feel like I'll never tire of hearing it. I love they way the album progresses and tells a story. Coldplay are amazing!
B003F3FJQO|4.0|If you thought James Dashner couldn't top the action and intensity from The Maze Runner, he does.  You learn so much about the world and the characters but the question that will bug you through the whole thing is WHY? Why is all this happening? The characters and their sarcasm are hugely entertaining. The characters are unique, likeable, charming and funny. I want to use their slang in my real life. Try and stop me, shuck-face.  An action-packed page turner and if possible, even more bizarre than The Maze Runner. It messes with your head until you can't tell what is real and what isn't, what is good and what isn't. You get a glimpse of a world that is still going through an apocalypse and what it would be like. What would you do if the whole world was desperate and you didn't have a choice? The cliff-hanger at the end is enormous and you just want to strangle someone and say, \\"TELL ME WHY! WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? I NEED TO KNOW NOW.\\"
B0054N73EY|2.0|As a fan who fancies One Hot Minute or Blood Sugar Sex Magik more than Californication or By the Way, this album is below my expectations.Especially after Stadium Arcadium, which I believe was a very successful piece of work, I had high hopes for the album to follow, but sadly my expectations are not met. If it was just a change in their sound, I would have respected it, but there is more to it. The melodies are not so powerful, the instruments are below their capacity and none of the songs increase my heartbeat. The vocals of Anthony is the only thing that keeps me going.I hope this was not a right time for their creativity and the next time will be.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app works flawlessly on my HTC Incredible. All of you giving low ratings need to state what device you're using, and quit whining about a FREE app that normally costs almost 15 bucks. This app is great, does what it says it will do, and is the best app I have found to handle all my document formats. I would grab this app while you can get it for free. You won't find an app of this quality ANYWHERE else for free, and it's well worth the $14.99 if you miss it as free app of the day. If you have problems with it or not, you need to let the rest of us know what device you're using. I can't believe people complain about a free app, and don't even list which device is having problems. It could be your device, NOT the app. Unreal.
B0007OASII|5.0|It is a very rare thing indeed, to buy an album and fall in love with every single track. If you're a fan of melodic metal, Kamelot is a must. I could write a very long essay praising this album, but if you're reading this review you must have an interest. Go for it.
0545123291|3.0|The pace definitely picks up in Linger.  The author switches narrators often which can be interesting and refreshing, but it was also sometimes confusing and frustrating to remember who was narrating.  There seems to be two story lines going at once and you'll find yourself rooting for one or the other.  Shiver stood well on it's own as a complete book, but Linger has \\"middle book syndrome.\\"  Good thing book #3 (Forever) is already out and the syndrome has a fast cure: read book three as soon as possible.

B000SMWUPS|4.0|This is perfect to hold sippy cups, keys, or other small things.  I have the Baby Jogger which does not have any space to keep these types of things in.  It works great with the stroller.  I keep it on and it does not get in the way of folding/ unfolding the stroller.  I would recommend this.
1933952806|5.0|I've purchased several D7000 manuals, including one that cost about $80.00.  Young's is by far the best.  It is well written and some of the more complex aspects of the camera are easy to understand.  The pictures are clear and in color, unlike the more expensive manual that looked blurry and in black and white.  And lastly, Young's manual has an index that i find very useful when looking up things.
B00280LYIC|3.0|It's like Harry Potter meets Ancient Greece with a mix of Bruce Coville's \\"My Teacher is an Alien.\\" It was entertaining, if not a little immature, but the part that was most touching to me was why Rick wrote these stories.  His son loved Greek Mythology and when Rick ran out of stories, he made them up.  He created Percy Jackson off the top of his head and Percy had ADHD and dyslexia like his son did at that time. The author was showing his son how someone became a hero with the same problems he had and, in an indirect way, that he was special.  Loved it even as an adult and I learned some Greek Mythology along the way.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I downloaded the full version of documents to go just yesterday. Right from the start i think i like this one better but maybe it's just because I'm pissed.
B003E6K1VK|4.0|I was looking long and hard for decent quality/priced amplifiers for my new Sennheiser HD650's<br /><br />I decided to go with this portable \\"E7\\" and I also decided to get the \\"E9\\" dock. I am not a sound pro, but I can tell you that I just love the sound quality that this gives me. I got it in July and I've been using it at least 18 hours every day (most of the time I forget to turn the dock off)<br /><br />This is a portable device, but I'm not sure that you'll find many people walking around with big headphones, so it's perfect if you are on the go with your Notebook or some mobile device.<br /><br />From my testing I can say that the E7 works great without the E9, but I decided to get the dock to keep the E7 in one place and at the same time to have something that looks pretty cool on my desk.
B001LF347E|5.0|Had not seen the 1st season & we were not disappointed. The stories are exciting, sometimes funny, always enjoyable. So get ready to go back in time & relive the days of Prince Arthur & Merlin as teenagers & all the many characters aroung them. Thanks Amazon for the great sale price!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|The Maze Runner is an intense, action-packed thriller but at the same time manages to be so incredibly moving. I'm reading this for the second time. I know what's going to happen, and I still get chills! Though it's pretty intense and sometimes a little dark, it still manages to be funny with the slang that the characters use. The whole book is practically dripping with sarcasm and I loved it.  The characters are great because they are so memorable, likable, and real. I even felt myself empathize with the characters I didn't like. While it's a dystopian novel, it's less about fighting a dictatorship and more about just surviving. It's unlike any other dystopian novel that I've read. When I finished it, I couldn't help wondering about how much I would fight against the impossible. Such a moving story about never giving up.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|There was a glitch in downloading it. But it looks like Amazon fixed that!  Thanks for such a great free app. There s alot of great tools to use with this :)
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is a great alarm clock app that reminded me of the Default Alarm on my Motorola Droid X. I have a [[ASIN:B004XD1S4M Samsung DROID CHARGE 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)]] now and the alarm on it is not very good, so this app came along side and impressed me.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|Amazing how some directors of great note, such as Spielberg manage to tell us that we are now getting a remastered set of some of their more interesting films and end up with something with the quality of an upconverted DVD. The only things that really stand out are the grassy areas during the daylight and the buildings and the vehicles look like they have a new coat of paint and when everything is daylight its very crisp, but the night scenes are just that dreary no improvement. Other then then that, the Dinosaurs especially T-Rex and Raptors, look like their tired 20 year old selves. The interiors scenes such as the DNA cartoon, which is horrible to look at more then ever it is so blurry and faded at its beginning  and the laboratory are nothing to roar about. Spielberg should look at the old Bond films like From Russia with Love and Dr No if he needs some pointers on how to remaster movies that are at least 30 years older then his movies.films and then come back and show us a real restoration. This is money grubbing. Nothing Less.  Oh and I forgot to mention the sleeve it come in. Like a VHS box open both top and bottom, so if you pull it off you shelf, be careful, dont let the falling, too thin for the outer box sleeve to stay snug, slide and drop right out and hit you in the foot or bust up the discs themselves.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|The Death Cure is quite the emotional roller coster. It was completely unpredictable and surprising, which I love.  So gripping and heart-pounding that I finished it in almost one sitting. One of the most intense books that I've ever read. It took me on so many twists and turns. Definitely the most violent book of the trilogy.  What an epic conclusion.  I can't stop thinking about it.  The ending was satisfying and felt like it was the way it was meant to be. It was so heart-wrenching and sad and even terrifying in some places. I didn't cry, but I wanted to - I think I was just too horrified.  Despite that, I found myself laugh out loud a few times. How he manages to be so funny with so much drama going on is beyond me. The whole story reminds me of Gandalf saying, \\"And he that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.\\"  So many things to think about. Is science really wisdom?
B000JIHP88|2.0|This looks like a very nice product, but the bracket to attach it to the crib didn't fit on our crib.  Its small and leaves only a narrow space for the railing it sits on.  If you have a convertible crib with a thick top railing this probably won't work for you.  Instead we got the Fisher Price Precious Planet mobile with the projection, which attaches with straps and is more flexible to the size of your crib.
B005NJ2K6U|2.0|While Gem Spinner II is a good-looking game, it's just not a lot of fun.  For fans of the PUZZLE GAME genre (it's not called \\"match-three\\"), this might be a good download as it puts a new \\"spin\\" on the formula.  However, for the rest of us, this and other puzzle games aren't going to do it.  When will we get a real game for Android such as Wolfenstein RPG?  PROS:  Good-looking  New take on the puzzle game genre  Priced reasonably  CONS:  Lack of creativity in puzzle pieces (how many gem games do we have to play?)  Not very fun  Has a bit of a learning curve
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Great app. Works as advertised. Just what I was looking for. Love having access to google docs plus pdf plus Msoffice in one place.
142311339X|4.0|I loved the mixing of Roman and Greek mythology. Rick Riordan takes Percy Jackson up a notch. There's more love stories going on and I liked the deep thoughts about the power of love. If you haven't read the Percy Jackson series, this will definitely spoil the whole series for you.  But to me, it didn't seem like it was necessary for you to read the Percy Jackson series first if you don't want to. It was funny with some action and love and great characters thrown in. He does a great job of reinterpreting mythology into modern day terms which makes it really fun to read.
034544678X|1.0|Lots of anecdotes with no resolution (what ever happened to Domino?) including a racist one depicting Mexicans in Texas as all drug dealers. Unimpressive really. My expectations were high. The part about primate behavior (what we and chimps do) as compared to canid behavior (what dogs and wolves do) was interesting. I'll stop patting my dog on the head and in exchange he'll let me hug him.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|The word processor is probably the best part about it, and it is about the same as all of the others. The excel is ok, and power point just sucks. You can't customize your power points, it pretty much just lets you put text in the slides, you can't move text around or anything.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Finally a great office suite for free. I was waiting for this day since long time. Nice features, dropbox support would be great but ya looks great on tablet.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Maggie Stiefvater is a great storyteller.  I liked how she used smells to describe everything. A lot of it made me think of Twilight. I always thought Jake had it easy. What if you couldn't choose to be a wolf? It was heart-breakingly sad and beautiful at the same time.  The pace was calm to me - kind of like winter. It was slow but refreshing at the same time. Loved it. It even made me cry.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've been using Android for about 3 years and for the first time ever, I have been able to open and edit Microsoft Office documents on my phone. This is mostly due to the cost of these apps (about $15-$30) and not having TOO much need to do this, but wow, this is impressive. This app works really really well.<br /><br />The pinch to zoom is just downright amazing, and means I no longer need basic Text Editor apps.<br /><br />For free, this is app is a STEAL!<br /><br />The only thing this app doesn't have that I wish it did, is a way to set the view to white text on a black background.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I hate to have to use Office Suite programs, but sometimes the company I work for sends me stuff I need to be able to open and edit as email attachments.  On my laptop I can use OpenOffice, and now on my Droid3 I can use OfficeSuite Pro 5.<br /><br />It can even be moved to my internal SD memory, mostly.  Very nice !<br /><br />Thank You Amazon !
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Love the control of Google Docs so all of my docs are easily accessible in the same interface.  Also, you can't beat the free price tag today.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is one of the most useful apps out there, and the fact it is today's free app on Amazon makes it pretty awesome. It melds well with Ms Office plus if you use a premium keyboard app such as SwiftKey X it just enhances its use.  well done and thank you Amazon. For the numptys that give this just a one star rating based on your poor opinion of other apps or Amazon, get a grip, it's a free app. Don't download it or uninstall it and find something comparable for the same price.
0316098329|5.0|I had bypassed this bestseller a number of times.  The theme of the novel just had not appealed to me.  Eventually, searching for a good read with positive reviews, I succumbed along with the masses.  This is an especial read.  A young girl is abducted and imprisoned in an impenetrable ROOM.  After two years, she gives birth to her and her captor's son, Jack.   The story, told thru the voice of the young Jack, is a unique, innocent and child like narration of the truth as he believes it to be.   How this new young mother and her child make it through is astounding.    \\"Ma\\", the mother, continues to find ways to keep them vital physically, sane, emotionally and intellectually alive, despite the confining, prison like circumstances.  With no compassion from \\"Old Nick\\", her captor, she keeps going.  Jack, at five years of age, still has no comprehension of what is real, the outside, and that there is indeed life, other children, cars, grass, houses, schools, hospitals, markets etc. beyond his immediate existence.  The tv that is provided them is merely a box of fantasy.  What their future would be and how they continued is the essence of the novel.  Upon reading \\"The Room\\", I became acutely aware of how the 'outside' forms us, makes and molds us for better, for worse, for part of the society and life we lead.  Of course, I would not be the spoiler and tell you the outcome, you have to read it for yourself...exceptional!
B005HS00ZU|5.0|Watch this on a 60\\" Samsung 3D plasma television and it was amazing.  It appears all the camera work was done with 3D in mind and with HD cameras.  It really makes you feel like this is better then going to the concert and it was for me.    I hope other artists give Peter Gabriel a call and inquire how they casn do this on their next concert tour, as well.  I will be buying more 3D concerts in the future for sure.
044654759X|5.0|Irecieved the book before i thought i would and it was in very good condition.Ireally enjoyed the book. Ilove Nicholas Sparks books. I would tell anyone who likes his books to read this.
B004289ZW0|5.0|I read the reviews of this product before I made a purchase and this product over-delivers in my opinion. My unit works great -quick to set up. Worked right out of the box, up and running in less than a minute. The receiver works great, has impressive accuracy and with bluetooth connects readily to my iPad. The cost was the real surprise... very affordable! I'm not a pilot, but I can see how great a tool this would be for aviation, as I use it for car travel. I read some of the problems people were having with the switch, but it works perfectly for me. Highly recommended!
B005LB1MY6|5.0|Let me preface this by saying I've been listening to this album for a few weeks prior to making this review, and it has certainly made a difference. When I first listened to the album I was confused and a bit angry. It's in Justice key, and you can hear the signature Justice modulator/syth here and there, but that's it. It turns out that this is an album that grows on you.  It starts with Civilization and Audio, Video, Disco, as these are the stars of the album. I was quite shocked at Civilization when I first heard it. My taste for music is for the dirty and powerful, which was all of Cross (minus D.A.N.C.E.). Once I became comfortable with it, however, it became very powerful, much in the way of Cross, but brighter. Audio, Video, Disco is the same way, albeit it reminds me of a heavier Daft Punk's Around The World.  If you are new to the album but loved Cross, I'd start off with Brianvision, Horsepower, and Canon. A quick aside; Canon (Primo) seriously reminds me of Led Zeppelin. Canon is just a great instrumental song. If you like Cross, you will like this song. It's one of the most powerful and raw songs on the track. Brianvision reminds me of The Brainwasher/Voyager in Justice key; it's a fantastic song as well. Horsepower is Justice's version of a day at Laguna Seca. First, and uplifting pre-race beat, then the beat goes mean. The chorus starts, the lights turn green, and a powerful 70's riff puts you back in your seat. The song finishes with a 1st place podium riff. Definitely one of my favorite songs on the track.  Now for the songs that will need tasting like a fine scotch - Parade, New Lands, Helix, On'n'On, and Ohio. Parade is still close to traditional Justice, but much happier. It literally sounds like parade music. A song that you'd want to get drunk and yell \\"NA-NANANA-NA-NANANA\\" with your friends. New Lands is where it gets different. The intro is straight up AC-DC, which turns into a powerful progressive rock chorus. Suddenly, you find yourself in aRush solo. It's a well done song, just not in the typical Justice style. On'n'On is a hard song to describe. Earlier 70's, strong and happy chorus. You'll just have to listen to it. Helix is where Cross and A,V,D are on two different ends of the spectrum. It is a good song, but it screams 70's workout sequence to me. Again, one that is difficult for me to explain.  Ohio... Yes. Ohio. I hate 1/3 of this song, sit well with 1/3, and my most favorite part of this album is 1/3 of this song. The beginning is annoying. The states have nothing in common with anything, the syllables sound awful, and his voice doesn't match the song... Until the second 1/3 of the song. The back beat starts matching him, and the song starts to make sense. This is all fine and dandy until the break happens, and then the most glorious, dirty, fat, beautiful synth comes upon you like antibiotics to the plague. It's glorious. Listen to it.  Overall, I would recommend this album, although I would have preferred a harder/more electro album. It's different and well done; completely solid. Definitely an album that needs some time to sink in, but once it does it satisfies. If you are a little shy, follow my recommendation of songs to listen to above. It may be easier than plunging into the icy water.  Eager to hear what people think about the album.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Hey, to all you Coldplay bashers out there, go pick a more challenging target.  It's easy to take pot shots at those that are successful, how about taking a look at yourself and wondering why you aren't a multi million selling stadium filling musician?  Now I like this album, and in the usual Coldplay sense it gets better with each playing.  It's much less cheesy than Viva la Vida, and more musically complex than the ones before that.  Does it have the anthems?  You bet.  It's Coldplay.  I'm no middle of the roader (but this isn't the place to brag about record collections) but I enjoy this for what it is - good, well written, well performed, well produced catchy thoughtful pop made by people it is okay to like.  That's my contribution anyway.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Surprised!  At first when I listened to it I thought what in the world...It didn't sound like her. It didn't sound fresh or catchy and so many words! Then I listened again and again and WOW!  I get it. If you like Stevie Nicks you will get it.  It almost sounds like she grew up and she is happy - not dark.  It is fresh and different - I love it!!  Thanks, Stevie!

B005LZSJ66|5.0|This is a grower of an album, that rewards repeated listening.  It's a more diverse set list than anything of theirs that has gone before but great for it (though the surprise of their first album can never be replicated of course).  There are good tracks and exceptional tracks, not necessarily all for listening in the same session - some quieter introspection and some good shoutiness to bring to bring a touch of their original baginess back.  Stick with it.  And I like the fluffy haired album artwork!

1451626657|3.0|This book used to be funnier.  When I read it as a teenager it was hilarious.  The absurdity, the foolishness, the ripping descriptions of situations and people with whom we could all superficially relate -- it made me laugh and shake my head and then laugh and shake my head again.  Now I'm an adult and -- with age and the experience of responsibility -- I picked the book up to enjoy it again.  And I didn't.  I still chuckled in the early pages but stopped reading by page 100.  First, I no longer found any of the characters remotely believable.  Even as a veteran, I didn't link the straw-man military types to real life.  Then I thought, maybe that's the point:  create over-the-top characters in order to skewer an idea.  But I still didn't get it.  Second, the unrelenting bitterness of the author's voice reached me this time and it annoyed me to no end.  Every character seemed to be either crazy or an idiot, unhappy with himself, a failure at life, stupid, dishonest, amoral or immoral, and even those who weren't were -- per the protagonist and the author -- therefore fools who didn't know how dumb they were.  Even in a work of satire that gets old.  In fact, especially in a work of satire it made me lose what the satire was supposed to be about.  Last, and this is a sure sign I'm getting old, I couldn't get past the protagonist's selfishness.  Absolutely I sympathized with his desire to fly no more missions.  But then I kept wondering, so who's supposed to fly in his place?  If he doesn't go, someone else has to.  Obviously the self-centeredness appealed to the 60's generation who made this book a \\"classic.\\" But now a few years on, it no longer seems so funny.  It's still an interesting book and worth reading if only to know how the title entered our lexicon.  But it's not as good as I remembered.  And it used to be funnier.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is perfect for quick edits of excel docs on the go. Which is what I am looking for. I actually bought QuickOffice Pro a while back when it was 1/2 off. I like this one a lot better. Much cleaner looking and faster when I'm searching cells. Now I wish I could get my $8 back for the other one. Oh well, at least I got this one for free.
B004J1DBJI|1.0|Sigh, why didn't I listen to the old adage \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\"<br /><br />Instead I applied an update this morning and now it crashes every time, with a reminder for me to redownload app from Amazon.  Erase. Redownload. Still won't work.<br /><br />Fix it.

0446556750|4.0|Heard THE REVERSAL (Hachette Audio), written by Michael Connelly and read by Peter Giles.<br /><br />It's a legal thriller about a convicted child killer who has been imprisoned for 24 years  . . . when he is released from jail because of new DNA evidence, longtime defense attorney Mickey Haller is persuaded to cross the aisle and work for the prosecution . . . he agrees, provided that he can choose both his investigator, LAPD detective Harry Bosch, and his second chair and ex-wife, deputy DA Maggie McPherson.<br /><br />Most of the book held my interest, though I would have liked to have found out more about Haller's motives in taking the case . . . I also enjoyed the twists and turns in the plot; i.e., until the ending . . . it seemed to have just been thrown together, as if the author was saying he had written enough, and it left me wanting something more compelling.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've been using MS Quick Office which came installed on my Android, and I can't believe how many more editing features this app has.  A much more MS Word-like experience than the version MS itself offers.  Plus, it lets you access and edit your Google documents, which is huge for me -- it happens to be where I store all my writing.  Writing this review should give you an idea as to mow much I love this app -- it's my first one ever.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this app is better than expected and i am surprised it works and LOOKS awome on my phone. great for starting docs while on the go. i agree i will transfer to computer to do a full edit before presentation. over all great app.
B0013K1ALE|1.0|Yes DVD has SOME of the footage from the 1973 concert at Madison Square Garden, but most of the footage is recreated after-the-event during a made-for-completing-the-film event, complete w/wigs and recreated stage and what not.  The absolute worst part is that the matching of the video to the audio is probably the WORST I've ever come across.  Hardly one lick from Page matches the video - it is matched singularly to Plant, and sometimes even misses that mark.  So, it is really hard to 'get into it' during a lick or solo when the timing is off.  IT IS JUST THAT BAD.<br /><br />When I first saw this streaming, I thought it was a bootleg because it was so poorly edited.  Then a friend brought the disc over and we checked it out.  I can't believe that the original members of the band approved of this release.  Scenes are noticeably, drastically out of sync w/the soundtrack.  Moby Dick was completely hacked up, and at one point they show the end of Bonham's solo on a different track!  Splicing is so bad you can see close up shots of an artist doing something or nothing and the soundtrack doing the opposite - just bad work.  It is actually hard to watch.  Do yourself a favor and try to obtain the original movie or just keep to the soundtrack but don't buy this piece of junk.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell's Japanese inspired musical track accompany's the thoughtful art direction for this simple, yet challenging puzzler.  Swiping the screen navigates a virtual rain drop across a virtual pane of glass where the object is to collect golden pearls in the fewest number of moves.  Fluid animation, attractive graphics,  combined with the gentle score and approachable game play makes Quell a fun and relaxing diversion.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|So far, so good. Seems to handle all office files with ease. Picked it up today for free, which is even better.
030788743X|2.0|Have you ever met someone at a party who talked your ear off for hours about their own personal obsession, which was unbearably inane and tedious, yet you couldn't seem to escape them?  That's basically what this book felt like.  Yeah, I get it--you love the 80s, and you know a ton of 80s trivia.  But have some self-awareness, man!  And know when to quit!  It's like he walks right up into your face and says \\"Hey, that Max Headrom was really cool, am I right?  Am I right?  Am I right, right, right???\\"  And he just keps elbowing you in the side over and over again until you respond in the affirmative. Ugh.    I'm sure some other reviewers (and perhaps even the author) will say, \\"Why didn't you just put the book down if you hated it so much?\\"  Because I'm a literary optimist.  Once I start a book, I feel invested in it, and I want it to wow me.  If it's a great book, I want to luxuriate in its greatness.  And if it's crap, I want it to magically transform itself into genius.  This book just stayed crap.  Seriously, I cannot understand how this book got so many positive reviews (including from the New York Times!).  It's a total recycling of well-worn movie plots, without any real effort to concel the theft.  And the author clearly has not spent much time around teenagers in the past decade, because not a one of them would ever say, \\"I needed to get the hell out of Dodge.\\" In fact, the most ridiculous aspect of the entire book may be the language of the teenagers.  Have you looked at a text from a teenager recently?  Literally every word is abbreviated.  Yet somehow, in the future, they all resort to using full sentences, correct grammar, and--gasp!--punctuation!!  Un-effing-believable.  I think I can sum up the author's thought process like this: \\"Man, War Games was a cool movie.  I wish I had written it.  They just don't make 'em like that anymore.  Now everyone likes The Matrix and Inception.  Wait, I know!  I'll just re-write War Games, mix in some Matrix, and tag on a quick Pokemon episode at the end.  VOILA!  A best-seller!\\"  And guess what--the girl at the end turns out to be just as beautiful as she was in the online world, and she falls for the schlubby boy.  Who didn't see that coming?  \\"Pikachu--I choose YOU!\\"
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|This is a decent office app. Covers much of the VERY BASIC functions, but don't expect much out of this. I haven't yet tried it for phones,  but I doubt I'd do much more than a quick edit on a phone,  since I have used other office suites very seldom. On my Transformer tablet though,  I want to be able to do financial presentations. It doesn't use any gestures at all! It has funky arrow buttons that you have to use to move from slide to slide.  On Polaris Office, there is no swiping either but you use taps which are just as intuitive. The a is optimized for tablets, but the Word portion has less editing and formating options than Polaris. I've also tried Google Docs and Documents to Go. For tablets, none of those can match Polaris. Try them all. You'll come to the same conclusion. The only thing that would be better would be for the browser to allow full editing of Google Docs on the web version. That's what we really need. All of this is just a stop gap until then.
0553801473|4.0|I'm pretty amused at all the people giving bad reviews to the FIFTH book in the series they have read.  The same people will be pre-ordering \\"The Winds of Winter\\" as soon as it becomes available.<br /><br />Yes, the book moves slowly. At times Martin follows characters I don't care about.  About halfway through, several characters get a bad case of the stupids simply to alter the plot. At the end, you aren't sure who is dead and who has betrayed.<br /><br />But, for hundreds of pages you are riding with Tyrion and waiting for his next bit of sarcasm.  You are back at the Wall with Jon trying to manage an impossible situation. Daenerys, Barriston the Bold, Victarion, and others make their way through the story.<br /><br />You have read the first 4 books so of course you will be reading this one.

1451629184|5.0|The world has done a lot of injustice to this poor girl. I don't think the single culprit in this story is Philip Guerrido though. After he had multiple registered accounts of sexual assaults, had spent years in jail, had been reported as \\"psychotic\\" and \\"dangerous\\" by his neighbors, and was an abuser of drugs, California police and judicial system enabled him to do awful crimes to her, and they should be held accountable for this (I mean actually prosecuting them). It is inconceivable that in the 21st century such horrifying crimes would go unnoticed if it weren't for the feckless and deplorable actions the authorities took with this case. The only person to help Jaycee was herself. Philip, Nancy, the police and the judges were all perpetrators in this story and it sickens me to know that she could have been rescued so many times if they had done their jobs. Thank god for the FBI agent who was not a complete mor0n and saved her.  Her story is one of the most harrowing I've ever read, it is extremely graphic and with each description I felt more sick to my stomach and angry. After reading this more than anything I just feel ashamed that in California something like this could happen. This story should be a testament to how sex offenders can get away with anything in this country, and how serious regulation should be installed immediately to prevent this from happening again.

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I had bought another app to transfer my iTunes playlists to my phone.  I just couldn't get it to work.  I opened Amazon MP3 and found my playlists on their cloud service.  I had forgotten that I had uploaded my playlist to their cloud.  I just download the playlist from the cloud to my phone and it's all there. You have to put your iTunes playlist on their cloud first, which wasn't a problem, then download or stream to your phone.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Wow this app is amazing. I can not believe people are rating this 1 and 2 stars. The app does exactly as its supposed to. Complaints about lag are kind of crazy to me as this will just be used in a pinch if you can't get to your computer or if your computer has crashed. it's as close to Office as your going to get for free (today or 15 dollars) and thats a steal.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|Great movie, however DVD does not have any features.  I am not sure if it worth to pay for the price, maybe wait till you can get it on sale.

B005CMSDLE|5.0|This is an intense, intriguing and enigmatic film; the viewer should be prepared to think, wonder and pay attention, as it is not light hearted. The character interplay is interesting, intense and somehwat ethereal. The plot is akin to that of Bourne Identity or any other CIA based plot, as this plot is also CIA based, however, this film does not move as quickly as say Bourne Identity, and the acting is less action oriented, and more melodramatic. Never the less, this film is definately worth seeing and feeling, as it brings up all manner of emotional sensations.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|What I felt my phone was missing. Should be part of the base os. Thanks for making such a great app.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|The cinematography is awesome, a step up from Thats it thats all (which is a feat in itself).  One of the best parts about this is people who don't even like snowboarding can really enjoy it for the sheer excitement and beauty it has.  Great Job all involved.
B005I64U5C|1.0|Buyer beware... this is not a normal digital copy, this is an attempt to force yet another set of services on customers to further control digital content. Everyone was fine with Windows / iTunes choice... on a few recent discs from other distributors than WARNER BROS i was even able to choose vudu or amazon video as options, very cool... more choice for digital copy is better. this is restrictive and garbage, it is a waste of resources requiring the movie to stream only, and according to many accounts if flat out does not work.
B004UC4HCG|3.0|It's quiet, has USB 3.0, SATA6gb, supports the current gen 1155 processors and sports a 300 watt power supply.  What's unique about it is that it also has 4 dimm slots which is a major bonus for me since I like to load my machine with as much RAM as possible.  This is the near perfect HTPC if you don't mind the boxy shape (I like it).  I put an Intel G620 processor it in and it runs cool, fast and power efficient.  This thing boots faster and feels almost as zippy in day to day operations as my i7-2600k desktop beast believe it or not (very subjective of course).  Native HDMI so you can plug it into a big screen TV to play movies and music.  This is my sixth Shuttle box.  Built another htpc using an antec isk300-65 case and found out it's not worth the time and effort vs using a Shuttle box.<br /><br />Update December 2012- I have several of these machines as well as a few other Shuttle variants.  I originally gave it 5 stars but taking away two stars because this particular model is not what I call stable.  After over a year of ownership, each of my SH67H3 boxes has developed one issue or another.  One box becomes unstable when the USB 3.0 front port is used.  Another box cannot wake from sleep. Another box loses its BIOS settings randomly, etc...
0385339585|2.0|I'd rate this story in grisham's bottom 20%.  Reminds me a little of The Broker (italy that time, not the amazon), but without anybody trying to kill anybody.<br /><br />Long winded alcoholic redemption story, shallow characters fighting over an inheritance and little else.
B002VPE1PW|5.0|This sleeve works well for me. Roomy enough to hold the iPad and my Kindle, as well as a simple stand and a pointer. The low, low price is very welcome.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|I Am Legend is a decent movie, as far as big Hollywood productions with big stars go.  This Will Smith vehicle has some compelling moments, and Smith uses some of the acting chops that were a big, big deal in his Muhammad Ali biopic; however, as far as serving as a worthy adaptation of the Richard Matheson sci-fi classic - this version of I Am Legend falls woefully short.  Note: this is the third attempt to adapt Matheson's story to the big screen, with the first being The Last Man on Earth (1964) and the second being The Omega Man (1971).  Missing from this 2007, CGI-heavy version is the nihilism and psychological horror which, in the original story, inspired George Romero to create his cult-classic, Night of the Living Dead.  This version of Matheson's tale is simply too slick, too polished in the name of a big-time celebrity to succeed as a horror movie; and the plot is too thin and loosely interpreted to succeed as science fiction - so it resides firmly in the realm of entertainment, losing Matheson's apocalyptic message in the translation, and sanitizing the most dark and chilling parts of a great story.  I recommend this for a night where you are in the mood for a mild thriller without too much tooth or bite or need for brain; also, the violence here is pretty tame by contemporary standards, but it will still be too much for small children and complete scaredy-cats.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|First, I love the Wolfram Alpha app. You should get it if you don't have it already.<br /><br />Oct 28, 2011: Just downloaded version 1.0.4.2660460 which works like it used to.

B001TVNU4C|4.0|i finally bought this box set. since it was only 29,it was a good deal to me, any ways i know all mj solo albums, including destiny and triumph (to me it goes along his greatest albums too),the demos are great but i;ve heard them already on youtube. but when i first heard them, i was amazed of how good they are. the bad thing is that some awesome songs are not here, like \\"they don't care about us\\" ,\\"human nature\\", \\"will you be there\\", \\"earth song\\" and \\"in the colset\\"and \\"scream\\" ,with those songs added ,it would have been a truly box set...  but even adding those, i think all mj songs,most his songs he released were awesome  even the not so lesser known songs like  \\"working day and night\\", \\"the lady in life\\",\\"leave me alone\\",\\"keep the faith\\", \\"give in to me\\", \\"money\\",\\"tabloid junkie\\", \\"is it scary\\", \\"morphine\\",\\"threatened\\", \\"whatever happens\\" ,some more that i can't remember now.  i think if you really wanna to know about mj music, buy all his solo albums, there are only 6,or 8 including \\"destiny\\" and 'triumph\\".  but if you are a casual fan , this is for you, but add the songs i mentioned above.  i can;t say much about jackson 5 material, since i don't know it too well. but still songs like \\"stop the love you save\\", \\"rockin robin\\" \\"never can say goodbye\\" should have also been added ...
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Red State is not what the generation of today consider a horror movie.  These are the ones who are whining and complaining that this isn't horror.  Before the late 70s, the horror/thriller/chiller genre was all about getting into your mind and terrifying you.  This movie does just that.    A truthful take on the fundamentalist right AND the behavior of the government, this film is just shot after shot of brutal reality.  Michael Parks as the Fred Phelp's-ish pastor is so scary just by dialogue alone, that he can talk for about 12 minutes straight, with no sort of action, and you are already shaking in fear.  Kevin Smith was always known as a dialogue man and he does NOT disappoint in this masterpiece.  He has certainly matured as a writer/director, mixing his own brand of snarky humor with the display of two equally sick organizations: The Christian Right and the police.    The ATF/cops in this film are bone-chillingly scary as well.  They barely hesitate or question to follow the most dastardly of orders by their sick and twisted superiors who seem to be above the constitution.  This films shows the Patriot Act for what it is...a horrifying \\"Get-Out-Of-Jail-free card\\" started by sick individuals.  John Goodman is outstanding as federal agent, Keenan...programmed to do whatever he is told, but sickened by every moment of it.  Just phenomenal.  David Klein's cinematography is just heart-wrenchingly awesome.  This filmwork does not take the route of these horrible torture porn/slasher \\"horror\\" movies of today.  Every shot was obviously carefully delivered and edited.  You can tell that Smith worked on the editing with care...every cut has meaning and is used to move the story, not just appeasing the post MTV generation an average of 3 seconds per shot.  Smith is not afraid to hold on a performance and let the audience sink into this very-real and dark world.   Thank you Kevin Smith, for showing the world what is happening right before our eyes with mostly your own money no less.  This is an amazing piece of celluloid and should be referenced 200 years from now in \\"History of Film\\" books.    Fantasy good times.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I think the game is actually really awesome but too easy. It took only a few hours to beat the first round in adventure mode. I wish they would add more levels but I think it's overall worth the money.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|I'd been impatiently waiting for Kelly's new album for months. However, it was definitely worth the wait. Stronger has proven to be, perhaps, her best album to date. It's definitely worth the $10.99.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Wow Amazon, thanks for making this app free. This is great for little changes to documents on the fly, where something needs to be edited in the here and now, and you don't have access to your laptop. Granted I have a phone and this app might be even more useful on a tablet. I haven't tested it on that yet, but I am very interested in what this app can do on there.
0446585025|1.0|THIS IS MY 2ND BOOK BY ELLEN DE GENEROUS WHERE SHE REALLY HAD NOTHING TO SAY.

A WORTHLESS  MEANINGLESS  BOOK.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've tried to minimize the spoilers and put in only what you need to know in order to know whether to read the book.  The reviews were so incredibly mixed for this final book that I really wasn't sure whether I should begin the series, much less whether I should finish it once I started.  Book One made me feel downright dirty - here's a book about the ills of a society that kills it's children in an annual \\"game\\"... and I'm reading about it and therefore participating in this atrocity.  Continuous reminders that it was fiction didn't help a lot but I still really wanted to know what happened next.  In the end - read the positive and the negative reviews and then decide whether to read the book.  Some caveats and/or disagreements that I have with the negative reviews (having now read the book) are as follows:  1) The book is extremely well written and the characters are consistent within themselves.  The lack of \\"action\\" on the part of the main character (Katnis) in book three actually fits in pretty well (imo) with the overarching theme of the books.  2) The argument that she does not \\"develop\\" in the same fashion as the world around her does... I disagree... I think that her actions at the end of the book cannot be predicted at the beginning of the series but when Katnis takes that final shot, it is completely in character for her to do so.  Her self-awareness definitely grows through-out the series, although her self-flagellation is still a little too much even at the end.  As for taking a role in the new government I don't think that would have been in character - she is fiercely independent and that just doesn't go hand in hand with being a leader.  3) The notion that too many people die in the last book.  Disagree.  There are many many deaths, but this is a series in which 23 children are killed in the first book alone.  Are there one or two deaths that were unnecessary from a plot perspective?  yes.  However I disagree that there are very many of those... mostof the deaths teach the main character something else she needs to know about her enemies, her allies, or herself.  So overall this is an extremely well written, thought provoking book.  It has a very specific message (one that can't really be laid out in a review without giving away important plot points) that is necessary to hear.  It will leave you crying in parts though so be prepared.  I think it's probably inappropriate for younger teens, but I can highly recommend it for older teens and anyone else who can handle the ravages of war in all its gory detail.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|There isn't a bad song on this CD. Definitely a CD you can listen you all the way through and thoroughly enjoy. Really good and talented band.
1595828095|5.0|This hardcover collection is a thing of raw beauty:  the game-changing work Wrightson did for Warren in the 1970s pushed the medium to new heights, and this beautiful volume gives his work the same lavish treatment Dark Horse has emplyed in its Creepy and Eerie Archive editions.  We see several incarnations of Wrightson is this book:  as artistic collaborator, and as a developing talent in his own right.  Some of the stories contained herein have long been my favorite examples of comic book horror, and to own them in such a wonderful package is a dream come true.  At this price, fans of horror and quality comic art just can't go wrong. Stop reading this and buy the book already.
B0058S0OMS|3.0|Halloween II is merely \\"OK.\\"  Far better than any sequel that came after it, and inferior to the John Carpenter classic.  The style and tension of the first movie has been replaced with a \\"Jason-esque\\" slasher rampage flick that dominated 80's horror.  When I was a kid, I liked this movie a lot.  But re-visiting it again as an adult, I was somewhat bored by it.  Working at a hospital myself, I found it hard to believe that the Haddonfield hospital was virtually empty (even the nursery!).  Having most of the film set at this location was a pretty bad idea.  Having a stuntman and not an actor portraying Michael Myers was another one.  My guess is that John Carpenter and Debra Hill were so busy with \\"Escape From New York\\" that they put very little thought into the story.  They just wanted to catch a ride on that money train.  Listen to the audio commentary on the original \\"Halloween\\" and Carpenter himself admits this movie is a disappointment.<br /><br />That being said, the blu ray picture is quite good, and the soundtrack sounds great.  The inclusion of \\"Terror in the Aisles\\", another movie I liked as a kid, makes it worthwhile.  That is the only reason I decided to purchase this.  Just as with \\"Halloween II\\", when the eventual blu-ray of \\"Halloween III\\" comes out, they're going to have to include something else to get me to bite (perhaps the original soundtrack on CD?).
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Taken purely as a documentary, the footage is spectacular.  The scope that is covered is simply phenomenal.  There is so much to the world that most people will never see or learn about, all packed into one Bluray (4 discs).  You will have to forego any creationist viewpoint (not a suprise, I'm sure) as it takes an old earth approach.  For me, it's not a problem - I can filter.  For my kids, a little narration and correction from Dad solves that problem.  If that point of contention does not matter to you or you are an evolutionist, you will be just fine.  I have deducted 1 star for the 1080i resolution.  It is noticeable as graininess, especially in large areas of similar color.  I had thought my receiver's video processing may have been introducing the noise, but after running a direct HDMI connection to my TV, the graininess was still there.  The picture does not look bad, it just does not look like you would expect with Blu-ray.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|This movie is an awesome prequel to the Batman story and the best Batman movie made to date (including The Dark Knight).  Blu-ray looks fantastic and the movie does not get old.  It's one of those movies that if you see it on broadcast/satellite TV, you will probably tune in to watch it even though you've seen it/own it.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|First off, thanks to the developer and Amazon for offering this $15 application for free.  I think most of us appreciate that.  This application installed easily and works quite well on my device.  I have a Dell Streak 7 running Honeycomb 3.2.  In a pinch, I can perform just about any simple ms-office like task right from my tablet.  Will I be creating vast Powerpoint presentations from this without templates?  Probably not, but I would hope most people wouldn't expect to do something like that.  Smooth interface and I have had no problems creating or editing documents.  Thanks again for one of the best freebies I have seen on here........with that said, PLEASE do not go and put up a really BAD free puzzle game tomorrow.....lol
B000H7J9QM|5.0|I love this movie because of one thing: the cars.  There are a lot of very cool cars that I will never own in this movie.  This movie also has one of the coolest looking Mustangs (or any other car for that matter) ever made in Eleanor.  Between this movie and my die-cast model of that car, they're probably the closest I'll get to having my own Eleanor...my wife agrees.  Though I should remind her that Eleanor is a CAR...maybe that's why she didn't take too kindly to the suggestion of \\"having Eleanor in my garage.\\"  Anyway, the storyline is decent, plausible, and not overly-done (like a Fast and Furious movie).  I like the character Cage plays, even though it's the same in most of his movies.  I really like Robert Duvall's character in this movie and he brought a lot of...what's the word...class(?), dignity(?) to this movie.  And the chase scene with Eleanor rivals the best ever done (Bullit), and personally I think it beats it.  Fun movie I don't get tired of watching over and over.  And really, this movie has been out for 10 years...I'm just brushing up on writing reviews.

0061537934|5.0|Loved the whole concept of the wonderful dog expressing his feelings verbally, so in touch with his people. Plus the heart warming and emotional side story full of anxiety for the human family was heart wrenching.  I gave the book to our veterinarian as a gift for taking loving care of our basset hound before we had to put her to sleep.  Jeanette
B005ZO6DIO|5.0|This has to be the best drama that is on FX right now. The story line on this never drags or becomes boring. This episode was sad I thought Clay may do something to Piney but shoot him!!!! I look forward to seeing Clay thrown out of that head chair. I wish that Jacks would take the spot but, he doesn't seem interested in it anymore. Too bad Tara is going away so close to the end of the season. Lets just hope Clay doesn't get to her toO!!!!!!!  All in all this series is excellent. If ur looking for a drama that keeps you guessing and transitions fantastically this is it!!  NEVER A BORING MOMENT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game and highly recommended to people of all ages. Looking forward to showing it to my grandchildren we can have fun together with it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I will describe this book in the best way I can:  By reading this book, Steve lives again.  I meant it as a compliment to how well written and most likely, as close as possible, to the truth.
B001PO53IO|5.0|Beautiful animation!  And if you haven't seen the episode \\"Rookies\\", you need to check it out.  There are some great stories going on in this show.  It's not just for kids.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|it's more complex than the original bejeweled (the only game I've played like this) and I loved that game. Seems a bit easy but is still engaging and it runs great on my optimus v.
B001GQSY64|5.0|I know a lot of people ended up panning this movie.  That's fine, everyone has their own opinion, and are entitled to it.  However, I grew up on the original Star Wars also, and I found this a fresh way of updating our favorite saga to thrill a new generation of young fans.  It's an enjoyable movie.  No, it won't win any Oscars, but it WILL entertain you!  Give it a chance, it is some of the best looking animation out there.  Pure eye candy!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Very good movie . Good acting and great cinematic special effects . Sticks to the story line  and they could not have picked a better person to do the role of Thor , and of The King which is  played by the magnificent Anthony Hopkins .
B003EYVY0E|4.0|Well, the third entry in the series certainly makes an entrance.  Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is fantastic!  Alan Rickman as Snape is delightful as usual.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|this is a very talentrf young singer with some deep roots to hic music and a lot of feel good songs
B002GJT4YQ|4.0|Not bad for a follow up.  I found that the actors are starting to get a little better, and fairly faithful to the book.
0060775858|5.0|30 years ago I bought this book for my baby daughters and now it is \\"my go to book\\" for my new grandson. He loves it and at a very tender age, is able to find the mouse hidden in the pictures. Just a great, great book. Absolute \\"must have\\" for any baby's new library!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|The best movie in the series.  I can't believe that this is the end.  These movies will stand on their own merits for many years to come.  They certainly go out on a high point.  Daniel Radcliff truly show's how he's matured as an actor.  Alan Rickman deserves an Oscar nod for his portrayal of Severus Snape.  I'm truly sad the series is finished, but I'm so happy they did the last book justice by splitting it into two movies.  When you see Hogwarts burning, and Harry willingly going towards his death, you will be choked up.  Buy this, your collection needs it.
0307120007|5.0|I bought this book 30 years ago when my 1st child was born. Now I bought it for my 1 month old grandson and it is the \\"go to book\\" for the wee little ones! Some of my grandchilds first word recognition came from this book - ie. \\"Play Peek a Boo with Paul\\" \\"Scratch Daddy's Beard\\". All these years and we still reach for this book. Another one that stands the test of time \\"Good Night Moon\\". Both books are my top 2 recommendations for any new parent starting their baby's library.
B004P9FAK2|4.0|After the Order of the Phoenix, I was worried how Half-Blood Prince would turn out.  I needn't have worried.  The movie is a vast improvement over the fifth movie, and is truly enjoyable and entertaining again.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|The mixing engineer in charge of this mess should be fired.  The songs seem decent, but they are so brutal to listen to, I cant even stand it. There is absolutely no dynamic range. It is basically from 0 to 100% volume in a 1 step on/off switch. People with ipods probably wont notice it, but others (like me) who have invested in good hifi equipment will find that this album is so badly done, there is no way to properly enjoy it. It sickens me that the recording industry these days is incapable of matching the recording quality of 25 years ago. Record EXECS: Overly loud music doesn't sell cds, it just blows out ear drums. I sure am glad I listened to a borrowed copy before I spent my hard earned money on this. Hopefully one day the band will actually listen to their own CDs and demand that you remix this....what a travesty.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|This is a very good adaptation to the book.  It truly brings the book to life.  I know the young actors aren't the best, but you have to cut them some slack. They are children in their first big movie.  The whole family can enjoy this movie.  All in all, done very well.
0060763280|5.0|For all those aspiring wealth congratulations this book is the way to begin. Ecker did not come from a wealthy background.He managed to aquire wealth through the use of psychology and mental conditioning .It is important to feel as if you deserve to have wealth. Let me repeat we deserve to have health and happiness.Erase all of your negative childhood depictions about money.Wether we know it or not through our subconscience we carry with us what our parents or caretakers would say about money,throughout our life.We must be aware of this and begin to recondition our mind.  There is a lot to learn with this book T.Harv Ecker is a entreprenur, financial coach, and writer that will raise your awareness with your way of thinking about money.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Well done movie.  I don't know if I would say it was better than Iron Man, but it certainly was entertaining and enjoyable.  It sets up well with Thor and Iron Man for getting us ready for the Avengers next May.  Chris Evans did a fine job as Steve Rogers aka Captain America.
B0018RVJWM|5.0|I've been having this book recommended to me from multiple people since it came out, but I just got around to reading it recently.  I didn't think I'd like it, the plot didn't appeal to me, frankly I thought it sounded a little strange.  Like `Cast Away' in book form and with a younger protagonist (but without the volleyball).  After finishing it, I am very glad I made the decision to finally give into all the hype and give it a try.  It was almost impossible for me to put this book down.  I wanted to know what was going to happen in the next chapter and I just couldn't resist reading on.  It does start out slow, but even in the slower part of the novel Martel does an excellent job of saying something.  It is through these beginning chapters we learn about Pi's religious beliefs, one of  the things which helps to keep him alive and sane on the life boat.  Martel does an excellent job of diving into the three major religious of Christianity, Muslim, and Hindu, and even makes a good argument as to why Pi cannot be all of these religions.  In these earlier chapters we also learn about the family zoo and the animals that live there, it is here we are first introduced to Richard Parker, getting back story on even the animal characters we will see with Pi later on in the book.<br /><br />Once Pi finds himself on the lifeboat the story picks up and it's hard to put this book down. Martel is a master of details, and I felt like I was on the lifeboat with Pi, dining on rations and enjoying the delicacy of bottled water.  I wouldn't say that this book is \\"gruesome\\" as I've heard some people say, it simple gives an accurate description of what's necessary to survive in `uncivilized' circumstances.  The ending was unexpected, although in retrospect I'm not sure why I wasn't able to see it coming.  I would recommend reading this book for those last few chapters alone.  It's here where Martel raises his most interesting questions about humans, animals, and reality... Even after it's over it's hard not to want to know more about Pi and his life at sea.t's hard not to want to know more about Pi and his life at sea.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|Simply outstanding movie.  No, you don't see much of Hogwarts, but you're not supposed to.  The Golden Trio are on the run, and this movie showed that perfectly.  Perfect way to lead up to the final entry into the film series.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I wanna get straight to the review of this amazingly epic album from THE AMAZING KELLY CLARKSON!!<br /><br />Mr. Know It All 5/5 this is classic Kelly right here! Its her shout out to all the people who spread those nasty rumors! In the video she has her wall covered in all these real articles pitting her on blast and this is her way of Remington them to kiss her a** you don't know me!!<br /><br />What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger) 5/5 OMG I love love love this song its definitely the most dance and remix ready song on the album and I love the message of saying you don't need to settle for a man who don't appreciate you you can find someone better and you'll be better for it!<br /><br />Dark Side 5/5 definitely my favorite rock ballad on this album! Its about revealing this side of yourself the dark side the side where all your secrets lye and hoping that this person can accept you and love you for all of you!!  Great song great message and totally relatable!<br /><br />Honestly 5/5 again a great ballad and definitely the most radio friendly ballad could be a great single choice! I like that she's saying love me or hate me think what you want but don't lie to me, be honest!<br /><br />You Love Me 5/5 has a very cool 80's sound and vibe to it, Kelly says its got a Tina Turner vibe and I agree! Its very fun Flirty and cool the classic its not me its you but it's really you! I love it!<br /><br />Einstein 4/5 the only song I don't really think is as on par as the rest! Its kinda silly verging on dopey but I do love the line \\"dumb+dumb=you\\" I sing it to my lover lol very cool!<br /><br />Standing In Front Of You 5/5 this song is a romantic movie! In fact it reminds me of that line thy Julia Roberts says in NOTTING HILL \\"I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her! ' ack it kills! I've had this relationship where your watching your friend search in vain when you know that you would be perfect for him!<br /><br />I Forgive You 5/5 this is my FAVORITE song!!!  This would be an epic single almost like the sequel to Since You Been Gone but dare I say better!! I love the lyrics as well I have been in this relationship I need to do this it insppires me! I love this song!!<br /><br />Hello 5/5 very good! Just a light hearted way of asking for help for someone to listen to be there for you when you need them!<br /><br />The War is Over 5/5 a tale of just throwing in the surrender flag on a failed toxic relationship! Just saying I'm done with the arguing I'm done with the fighting and I'm done with you saying things will change pulling me back in and breaking my heart again, I'm done! Very good!<br /><br />Let Me Down 5/5 its about the Guy you love and want to believe in but you can tell in the way he moves the way he acts that when things get tough he's gonna be the Guy who bails and leaves you hanging! I've also been here with the same Guy! Straight outta my journal!<br /><br />You Can't Win 5/5 this is Kelly's kiss-off to all her haters telling them to butt out of her life her secrets are her secrets and the way she lives her life is no one but her owns!<br /><br />Breaking Your Own Heart 5/5 I heard that this is Kelly's anti love song to herself! Is about just being to hard on yourself and failing to see the good things because your so scared of what could go wrong!<br /><br />Don't You Wanna Stay 5/5 I love Jason aldean as a artist and him and Kelly sound beautiful together! Its a very romantic song it almost makes me wish they would be in love!<br /><br />Alone 5/5 the best of the bonus tracks! I love the message again about an inattentive lover and just telling him off saying your sick of feeling like you're alone screaming when he's by your side not listening!<br /><br />Don't Be A Girl About it 5/5 one of my favorite sayings! Kelly's taking the dominant role in this song its got a very P!nk feel to it but I dig it!<br /><br />The Sun Will Rise 5/5 a great duet with the amazing Kara Dioguardi its about being battle torn and tired and being ready to give up but seeing that its about to get better and its not the time to rest yet, love it!<br /><br />This whole album is amazing and is full of hits! Its another shot outta the park for Kelly! Totally worth the wait this girl this artist is worth her wieght in talent amazingly epic!f hits! Its another shot outta the park for Kelly! Totally worth the wait this girl this artist is worth her wieght in talent amazingly epic!
0062101897|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful book.  If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you really need to get this.  It is stunning in the amount of detail and photographs.  You will be amazed at the sheer amount of beautiful photos and concept art.  It is well worth full price, so you really can't pass up the deal Amazon has this for.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I would use it a lot more often if you could just sift through amazons categories instead of having to search for something specific. The search filters are also much less useful than the ones on the site. Deals of the day (gold box) would be nice as well.
B004SF30HI|5.0|This soundtrack is full of music and artists that I enjoy, from Bossa Nova to Taio Cruz, to a lovely song by Jamie Foxx. Very upbeat and dance-able! And a steal at 5 bucks - I intended to get just one song, but got the whole album. Very satisfied with this purchase : )
B0055SWM08|4.0|It is a great puzzle game that was quite challenging to completely finish. However, I wish it had more and bigger levels with a better variety of traps.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|One of the best app on Android. Works well on my lg optimus one. I Can manage all files easily
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Absolutely the best keyboard on android. The predictions are incredible and quickly learn your vocabulary. The only feature I would like to see is customizable layouts.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Even though it is asking for a payment type, it did not charge my card and invoiced as $0.00.  A program shouldn't down just because Amazon is asking for a pay type.  Please rate it fairly on the functionality and not Amazon.  And if for some reason, you do get charged for it, Amazon will refund you the price.  I will add my review for the program once I try it out.
B00004TH83|5.0|If you have not heard of this artist you are missing out on one of the most beautiful voices.  A rare find.
B005KELR3A|2.0|Maybe I should have purchased a \\"cover\\" instead of a \\"sleeve.\\"  There is only one exterior photo of this item, and I didn't realize that it's nothing but a pouch.  It seems to be made well enough, but it's a soft pouch and it opens only on one side, though it has two zipper tabs.  It's worth $9.99 at the most, not $24.99.  It was going to be the first thing I've ever had to return to Amazon, but my husband decided it's a good fit for for his GPS and accessories.  This pouch just doesn't seem like it would be good protection for my Kindle.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|I don't care if you are the biggest Jurassic Park fan out there, DO NOT BUY this blu-ray set.  The video transfers here are HORRIBLE.  The picture is so grainy, it's like you're watching the film through a sandpaper filter.  The original VHS tapes (after having been watched 100+ times) STILL look 1000x better than the video on these discs.  I hope Velociraptors hunt down and eat anyone involved in putting this mess together.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I'm using a droid x and so far I'm amazed by the features.  Especially since this was a free app of the day.    The ms compatibility, google integration and decent UI put this way up on my favorite list.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I've been reading a lot of reviews on here, and I'm surprised that some of the fans are disappointed with this particular album. The sound is different than their debut, Fallen, but let's face it, the group has grown up. They are all grown musicians who are in the business for more than 10 years, so we must give them credit for trying to break free from the whole \\"gothic metal\\" label from the beginning of their career.<br /><br />I must admit, this album actually sounds like the whole group worked together, as they had stated in numerous interviews. You can still hear the classical parts, but the overall sound is fresh and beautiful. I'm going to say a word or two about each of the songs, although there are much better and thourough reviews on here.<br /><br />1. What You Want - I think that it's brilliant that they've chosen this song as their first single because it's very fun and catchy, especially the video that comes with the deluxe ediion of this CD.<br /><br />2. Made Of Stone - A really classic Evanescence song with hard guitars and soft piano parts.<br /><br />3. The Change - This song has such a beautiful chorus, I absolutely love the electronic intro.<br /><br />4. My Heart Is Broken - Piano at the beginning is so ethereal that it easily made this song a favorite for me. It's almost magical how good this song is, and the continuous piano just adds to the sound.<br /><br />5. The Other Side - This song shows the new side of the band, it's hard and bad-ass. The lyrics are really strong.<br /><br />6. Erase This - Perfect combination of piano and drums at the beginning, and around the chorus the whole band joins in, creating a full sound.<br /><br />7. Lost In Paradise - Really emotional ballad, Amy Lee has an amazing voice. I easpecially like the slow beginning with cellos in the background, and the powerful ending.<br /><br />8. Sick - Catchy chorus, similar to What You Want. I think this song would be a great single if they ever choose it.<br /><br />9. End Of The Dream - Lyrics are so poetic on this one, I think that's what I like the most about this song. It reminds me of a gothic setting.<br /><br />10. Oceans - The band did wonders to the sound on this one.<br /><br />11. Never Go back - Amy Lee stated in an interview that this song was inspired by the disaster that hit Japan earlier this year, the song is very powerful.<br /><br />12. Swimming Home - This is another ballad with slightly electronic beats throughout. It sounds really good and the lyrics are ethereal. Chorus melody is outstanding.<br /><br />13. New Way To Bleed - What I like the most about this song are the drums at the beginning of the song which gave the sound an oriental touch. The melody is beyond words, I think this is my second favorite on the album.<br /><br />14. Say You Will - Another catchy and fun song. I like the simplicity of it.<br /><br />15. Disappear - There is a part around the chorus that is really new in the Evanescence sound and it adds to the music and builds up until the end.<br /><br />16. Secret Door - Amy Lee took harp lessons during the band hiatus, so this song is entirely played on that beautiful instrument. The lyrics are amazing and really emotional. I'm so glad that they included this song on the deluxe, since it lacks slower songs that were somewhat typical for Evanescence' earlier sound.song. It reminds me of a gothic setting.  10.

1573225517|3.0|High Fidelity is a 1990s male story of life and popular culture. The narrative is full of dialogue and contemplation that is steered around a mid-life-mid-life crisis. One of the strongest aspects of this story is the philosophy that is provided regarding relationships, which is presented as plausible and often easy to relate to. At times I did find it tiring to read this book as it is quite heavy with detail. However, the story contains a steady supply of interesting situations and descriptions.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|For overall quality I would have normally given this app three stars.  However, the excessive permissions granted to this app have me questioning the developer's intent.
B000P12LWY|1.0|I ordered the complete first series of the Tudors, and I only received discs 3 and 4. It said that I was to be getting the complete first season and it's not like you can watch it starting from disc 3! I'm very disappointed.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I've been listening to this album since its release in 1984. All I can really say is the storytelling is so fantastic in the album-that one can almost visualize the poor soul through every moment of the epic journey.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This program actually works as designed. I love it. The office program that came with the phone never worked and wouldn't open Word and PowerPoint files.  With this officesuite, I can open, edit, and compose making my phone a true mobile office when I can't access a computer on the go. It is truly worth the price! Droid 2.
B005IGVYUG|5.0|By my third listen I was calling this the album of the year and among Tom's VERY best. The question is whether it's just in the category of his damn good category of greats like Bone Machine, Swordfishtrombones and The Black Rider or if this will be considered in league with his greatest masterpieces like Small Change, Rain Dogs, and Mule Variations. It's got the bellowing, grumbly, ferocious rockers, it's got boozy piano torch songs, nostalgic laments, street ballads, and is brimming with his classic phrasing and aphorisms. It also seems like this would be a great introduction to Tom, it revisits some of his best styles to excellent effect.  This may just be influenced by a bit of over-excitement, I am the type that will always hype my favorite artists' new albums, but if you were to compare this with my reaction to his last studio album, Real Gone, there's no comparison. Real Gone had some really good songs and some interesting experiments but also a number of songs I knew I would be quickly forgotten and a couple of those experiments didn't quite work. There's not a duff track on Bad As Me. Just wait for some guy with a conventional voice and no talent with a pen to take a song from this to the charts- it could very easily happen, Rod Stewart style.  The only problem, the production, sometimes they go a little overboard on making this sound tinny and low fi. I'm getting used to it.  I was initially confused as to why this deluxe version had the three extra songs on a separate disc. The truth is they don't fit, the thirteen song length is perfect... and he probably did leave the three weakest tracks for the extras- good, but not great. They really are \\"extras\\".
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've downloaded my music in FLAC since a couple years now, and I'm so glad I did now that I got those headphones.<br /><br />I'm a huge 60/70's rock'n'roll fan, and I'm rediscovering a new experience with the Beatles records, and I thought I knew every second by heart. Everything sounds crisper, closer. I can't really describe how better is the sound as I don't have the appropriate audio terms, but it's definitely worth the price.<br /><br />They're also pretty good-looking, a mix between vintage and modern look, and I love the big red \\"right\\" and blue \\"left\\" on the sides. The jack is great, long enough to swing your head around, yet you can easily set it up to an iPod in your pocket, stuffing some of the cord in there or letting it hang out at thigh-level.<br /><br />They are pretty comfortable, the longest I've wore them is a \\"The Wall\\" + \\"Dark side of the moon\\", and no problem to report.<br /><br />Last but not least, noise isolation is pretty good, although they're not as efficient as noise-cancellation headphones. Wore them in a plane, turning up the volume masked part of the engine, but not completely.<br /><br />Greatly satisfied with my purchase, I hope they'll last for several years!<br /><br />Get one, while I queue more record to my \\"rediscover music\\" playlist...
B000IHSKUM|5.0|This is my second pair of this model of sandals.  The first pair lasted for two years through various hikes through the northeast US, from parts of the White mountains to the trails in the Shenandoah's, in all types of weather and all seasons.  Loved them.  There super comfortable, held my feet secure, and never broke down.  In fact the only reason I had to buy a second pair is because the first pair was lost in a move.  On the fitting front I'll echo other reviewers and say the sandal tends to run a half size big.  Also Keen footwear as a whole is made for a wider foot, at least on the male side.  Highly recommended.
0553381695|5.0|This book picks up right where the first one ended.  I had trouble getting into Bran's story it just didn't seem all that interesting to me.  But overall this book was AMAZING it really picks up a lot at the end with a lot of twists that you would never expect to happen.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app is great so far, it opens office attachments from my work email. Monkey Island Gardens tube station name of the most important things in
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Docs2Go is much better. This app takes forever to open a PDF file, has no support for Dropbox and is iffy when it comes to accessing Google Docs. If you can get it free, take it, but if you have to pay, spend your cash elsewhere.
0385732554|4.0|This book is not for young children.  The issues that this book addresses are deep and disturbing.  Euthanasia, infanticide, drug dependence, depression, war, \\"brain washing\\", and deception are some of the issues this book addresses.    I read this book knowing only the title and author.  It was captivating but the images are too disturbing for young children or even young adolescents.  I have my own children read this book when they are 16 or older and we definitely discuss it.  Discussing the book helps alleviate any shock they may experience and also helps to clarify some of the vagueness in the book.  It is science fiction.    One of the reasons that this book is so controversial is that it is such an easy read while being about such heavy topics.  This is a \\"childrens'\\" book about an evil evil society.  No child should ever have to bear the burden which the author placed on Jonas.  But in cultures and societies today many children face far worse.    Admittedly the ending is vague, however, a reader can make very positive inferences about the time of year and appearance of the town at the end of the book.  The book's message is one of hope.  The value placed on life and freedom is clear.
B004EPZ020|3.0|I recently saw PA3 and was not as creeped out as the first one. I know a lot of people loved this movie, I unfortunatly was not one of them. I liked the originality of the original and now I know what to expect. The scares are just not there. It was a decent attempt and it wasn't that the director was lacking anything. Its just that I already seen it before. I get tired of a original idea for a film doing really well then there's numerous more made. I seen it before now try doing something else original to scare us. If you trully loved the original you will like this third instillation. This is supposed to be the origins movie, to explain how Paranormal Activity began. I don't want to ruin it for anyone but this movie reminded me and my family as another Blair Witch project. Watch the movie and wait till the end to understand what I mean. I would trully wait for this movie to come out on DVD and wouldn't waste your money at the theaters. If your like me and are tired of all the SAWS and Final Destinations that just keep being made. This will probably be no different from those franchises. How much originality can you come up with when you hit part 9. In a few years you'll see Paranormal Activity In Space or something like that. It's done now give us something else to enjoy. The only thing that seems to be dead in Hollywood is originality. Hey there's an idea Paranormal Activity 6 The Ghost of Original Movies.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I have 2 little great nieces that I wanted to share it with. So this purchase was for them.  I haven't actually viewed this particular DVD since they live out of state.  But I do know that it arrived quickly and appeared to be in excellent condition as stated.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Super fun, slightly challenging, great idea! My favorite game by far simply because of its originality, easy control, and smooth operation. Have you fed omnon??   HTC thunderbolt

0545310601|4.0|I confess that I was heartbroken to see this fabulous story come to an end in this third book of the trilogy. I totally loved the first two books, and while this last and final book is not as good, it is still a highly entertaining and enjoyable book, as well as a fitting end to the trilogy.<br /><br />The book is about the loss of what one may hold most dear and about hope. It is also about the fact that things may not always be as they seem.  It is the continuation of our heroine's journey in life and some decisions that she needs to make.  There are also some twists and turns in that journey that lead to an sudden life or death decision.<br /><br />Kudos to the author for writing this trilogy, which was originally targeted to the young adult market but ultimately captured the heart and imagination of people of all ages. I am so glad that I read it and am looking forward to the movie based upon the series.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Looking for an office like app for your tablet when the cloud  Google docs) isn't available?  OS Pro is the best of the bunch.  The formatting isn't perfect and it can be downright frustrating at times,  but generally it suffices.  Additionally, it integrates with Gdocs though occasionally I've noticed problems with saving documents.  Besides, if I have access to Gdocs then there isn't much utility working outside of the native browser other than the risk of introducing errors.  Overall,  OS Pro is worthwhile.

B0051GOB26|4.0|The Big Lebowski doesn't need a review, so if you're here to read about the film, this won't be helpful. This is a review of the Blu-ray Limited Edition with book.<br /><br />That being said, this is a very nice edition. The photographs in the book are great and are fun to see behind the scenes action, especially Jeff Bridges' photos. He's a talented photographer utilizing his unique pano camera.<br /><br />The Blu-ray conversion is clean, crisp and well done. The picture and sound are excellent. The digital copy is a nice plus, but consider that the coupon expires on 12/31/12. Its more than a year away, but its worth noting in case it's something you forget to take advantage of.<br /><br />However, my biggest complaint is this. The size of the book (which holds the physical disc) is actually just a little larger than standard Blu-ray cases. While this may not be a big deal to most people, if you're like me and have bookshelves fit to the height of a Blu-Ray, this movie can't stand on end. It has to be laid flat, or sideways on the shelf. It's a little thing, but for those with extensive collections on shelves, it can be annoying.<br /><br />Overall, the Blu-ray edition is a nice step-up for those looking to upgrade their DVD or add it to their collection.
0143038583|4.0|Pollan justifies the eating of animals by saying that it can benefit the group or species (by culling the weak and preventing population crises), whereas the other point of view, represented by Peter Singer, values the individual over the group and so forbids the killing of animals for food. So Pollan is applying a different standard to animals than he would to humans. That policy applied to humans would justify very un-PC practices like eugenics, population control, and social Darwinism, which I'm sure Pollan abhors. So how would he resolve the carnivore's dilemma? I would be interested to read a book about that.

1612930174|5.0|Probably one of the best known and best written of the original A.C. Doyle Sherlock Holmes stories (that I have read so far).  This is a great read around Halloween-time as it combines some of the most creative mystery fiction with elements of a horror novel.  Usually I can get a pretty good idea about what is going on in a Sherlock Holmes story/novel...but this one had me guessing the truth until the very end.  The story essentially surrounds the mysterious death of one of the last remaining Baskervilles and the spectral hound that is supposedly a curse on the entire family.  If I have a complaint about this story it is that the ending was somewhat anti-climactic.  But the journey to get there more than makes up for the somewhat vanilla ending.

0887307280|5.0|Wow.  \\"E-Myth:  Revisited\\" should be on the list of required reading for anyone who wants to start a small business or feels trapped by their current small business.  This book completely turned everything that I thought I knew (and I have an MBA) on its head - particularly the assumption that you had to start a business based on your existing competencies.  You don't.  The chapter describing the \\"Entrepreneurial Seizure\\" seemed like it was written just for me.  The basic premise of the book is that in order for a business to survive and grow, it must be built upon a \\"turnkey\\" repeatable set of systems, processes and procedures.  As an Enterprise Architect whose career has been built upon constructing repeatable systems, I wholeheartedly agree.  The material itself isn't revolutionary.  However, the fact that someone was able to package it into a concise and easily applied methodology is somewhat revolutionary.  A book that I wish I had read years ago.

0743437497|5.0|The Shining is the story of a psychic kid, an alcoholic father and a fear-controlled mother who are trapped by winter weather in a luxury mountain hotel - with a very evil past.  It is definitely one of King's spookier books.  Living in Colorado, I have to say that I was impressed with the level of authenticity in terms of how accurately King described the local scenery, newspapers, etc. of the mountain areas of the state.  King does a masterful job of setting up the situation, developing the characters and then of building the suspense.  I vaguely remember the movie from when I was a kid (now that I've read the book...I don't understand the casting).  King describes the events in the book by alternating between the perspectives of the different characters - this leads to very deep character development and a very rich experience.  Part psychological thriller and part ghost story, the fear gradually builds until all hell breaks loose.  Definitely one of King's best books.

B004GJNFHG|5.0|As an American I am new to this subject. This movie brought tears to my eyes. It's so shocking to see how inhumane and cruel people can be to another and how the government allows such tortures. I've never understood the concept of being cruel to someone because they have done something wrong. I was always raised that 2 wrongs does not make it right and that we as humans don't have the right to judge only God does. Don't get me wrong I believe people should be punished and serve their time for committing a crime but doesn't give one the excuse to be evil in return, it appalling.   The cinematography was beautiful. Steve McQueen is a genius. I can't wait to see more works from him in the very near future. As for Michael Fassbender he was the most touching of all in the film. Wow is his performance was wonderful.  This is a must see film.
B0045EPCQ4|4.0|After I read Eat Pray Love I started looking for more of Eliz Gilbert's books.

B001LMU182|5.0|This is one I first got on the original VHS format that included the now defunct Streamline \\"State of the art, Japanese animation\\" trailer montage featuring the original Vampire Hunter D, Silent Mobius, Neo Tokyo, etc. I popped my anime cherry with Akira and Fist of the North Star, but it was Akira that really blew me away with its sci fi and especially its artwork, the amount of detail and movement in this film is massive. This film remains a primer for anyone remotely interested in knowing why people like me are so nuts about anime.<br /><br />Basically, this film is a Frankenstein story that takes place in the year 2012 in Neo Tokyo, called so because it's right after a cataclysm similar to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A super powered boy named Akira who was the subject of secret government experimentation played a major part in the cataclysm and for this reason is contained in a cryogenic vault at ground zero, which is beneath a stadium. Determined to master and control \\"the ultimate power,\\" the government sets its sights on another guinea pig, a short, unstable, biker named Tetsuo who happens to be obsessed with a cool, red, turbo-charged bike owned by his best friend Kaneda.<br /><br />This film looks incredible. The colors just pop at you scene after scene. The opening scenes at night are simply breathtakingly colorful. Comparisons to another cyber-punk classic from which this film derives its look, Bladerunner, are especially evident in its use of neon against a night backdrop. Amazing what can be done without 3d or cgi. The rainbows chasing the motorbikes, the motorbikes themselves, the clothes, the cityscape--everything about this film is eye-candy, almost too sweet, but I love it.<br /><br />Despite the visual achievements of this film, the dialogue is embarrassing and cliched. Mr. Otomo shows his weaknesses in the writing department here but I'm not sure if this isn't due to it being translated into English. Maybe it sounds better in Japanese. But here it sounds very hokey. But in the end it didn't matter to me as it most likely won't matter if you see this film for the first time. Even after all these years, as far as animation has come, Akira still looks good. I think what makes this film age well is the fact that what you see on the screen is completely organic, that is, done by real people, an army of people working day and night to bring this enormous vision to life. A true anime masterpiece.y. But in the end it didn't matter to me as it most likely won't matter if you see this film for the first time.

0385738773|4.0|(Spoiler Free)<br /><br />Finally, Book #3.  I'd been waiting for it to come out for what seems a very long time.  I was looking forward to this read because I was curious to see how the various mysteries played out and I was also wondering if the fast pace of Books 1 & 2 would have to be abandoned as Dashner filled in the 'back story'.<br /><br />Turns out there was no dead time.  The pace was just as frantic as the first two volumes and if people say that they didn't get all the answers they wanted then I think it's likely that they were so caught up in the story that they didn't recognize them.  Which is not to say that every 'i' was dotted and 't' crossed.  There's a few minor things that weren't hashed out, but I can say that they were trivial and not knowing didn't influenced how much I enjoyed the book, at all.  In fact, I happen to like a little mystery left so I can chew things over in retrospect.<br /><br />THE SKINNY:::<br />If you can't quite recollect the action in the first books you probably need to scan them again.  There is no rehashing of events for the most part like you sometimes get in the first chapters of books in a series.  You are dropped into the action...<br /><br />Enjoyable, fast paced book.  Dashner has grown as an author and it's just very good.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5Stars because I thought there were some rough spots at the end where the plot elements were a little lame.<br /><br />Highly recommend the series for those that like dystopian action.  There's fake bad language -- Oh grunk -- and violence.  Not to mention some great tense moments.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />#kidlit/#yalit blogger
B0053YGYO4|1.0|What happened?  An amazing bad lays a huge egg.  They try too hard to be epic.  There is very little musical distinction between many of the songs. It's more loud than it is good.

1451648537|2.0|The constant assertions that every Jobsian moral lapse, emotional outburst, insensitive remark, and overall cruelty and impatience is entirely attributable to Jobs having been adopted cheapens this book throughout. While the history is interesting, the constant hammering on adoption as irrevocably scarring \\"abandonment\\" is lazy, at best, and generally disgusting. It's like saying that Bill Gates would have been a much more ethical and patient businessman if only he hadn't been raised by his birth parents.  I would imagine Isaacson's next effort will be a book on Moses, asserting that he fell short of reaching the Promised Land because he was adopted.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I am going to be honest with you, I had no idea what to expect going into this movie. I have not read the book and at the time that I saw the movie I had only seen one preview for the movie. I basically knew that it was about a writer that wanted to be controversial and write about \\"The Help\\". I expected lots of drama. I expected an okay movie with some happy moments and lots of not-so-happy moments that most of us wished had never happened. What I did not expect was humor. I did not expect Oscar worthy acting and a movie that I did not want to end. I did not expect a feel good movie. However, that is exactly what I received with The Help.<br /><br />Emma Stone was incredible as \\"Skeeter\\" the reporter who sees things differently from her peers and decides to show the world from the viewpoint of \\"The Help\\". Her character is instantly likeable and you find yourself rooting for her in her career, friendships and even in love. She is sweet, yet fierce and not afraid to say what is on her mind. This is the first movie I have seen Emma Stone in (although Easy A and Zombieland are now in my Netflix que) and this one movie was enough to make her one of my favorite actresses. She is that impressive.<br /><br />The great acting did not stop there. Bryce Dallas Howard (you know her as \\"Victoria\\" from Twilight!) was great as the evil Hilly who treats her maid as though she is another species. Hilly demands that the maids have a separate bathroom and do not enter the \\"clean\\" inside bathrooms. Her goal in life seems to be that every housewife receive the same outdoor bathroom so that they do not have to suffer.<br /><br />My second favorite actress in this movie (after Emma Stone) was actually Jessica Chastain. She plays Celia who is an outsider to the locals. She tries to make friends with the housewives and fails mostly due to Hilly's hatred of her. She is for lack of a better term, slightly ditsy and hilarious. At some points in the movie she is insulting Hilly without even realizing it, at others she is just making a mess of everything. She is always trying desperately to fit in. Her character is lovable and definitely unforgettable. It did leave me wondering though why her and Skeeter were not friends.<br /><br />Also of note is Sissy Spacek who plays the crazy, but hilarious older Mother of Hilly. She is a troublemaker throughout the movie and great to watch.<br /><br />Last but not least, Octavia Spencer as Minny (probably the funniest character in the whole movie) and Viola Davis as Aibileen were amazing. They had great chemistry with each other and also with Emma Stone. Their characters are both strong in their own individual ways and great to watch. Minny (Spencer) gives the entire movie a feel good quality and makes you laugh so hard it hurts when she finally gets her revenge on Hilly.<br /><br />This is a feel good movie that will have you laughing and possibly crying. It is definitely worth it to buy this move. I can't wait until it is released on DVD so I can own it and watch one particular scene over and over again (it is the funniest thing I have seen this year in a movie, watch it and you will KNOW).just making a mess of everything.

1423140591|5.0|Percy Jackson is back! Along with a couple new friends, Hazel and Frank. Just like Jason Grace in the last book of the series, Percy has lost all his memories. And needs to go on a quest in order to get all his memories back from Juno. The book is action pack and a great adventure.<br /><br />There is a lot of Roman mythology in this one, as Percy finds himself in the Roman camp, Camp Jupiter. Romans are a lot different than Greeks. For one thing they are a lot stricter. Both camps have a lot of difference and this book shows in great detail the differences. Percy knows he is initially from a camp but Camp Jupiter feels wrong to him in some way. But, he must gain the trust of the campers there even though they know he is different.<br /><br />In the end, the two books of the series are pulled together as one and readies itself for the seven in the prophecy.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one, I want to know what happens next. I can already imagine what Percy or Jason will do next and I can't wait to read it!

1613821395|4.0|This book is an amazing teaching tool. Not because it conveys any great lessons in life or exhibits profound understanding and insight but because it so clearly delineates the beauty and differences in 19th century writing and 21st century writing.   The story is definitely very gothic and one of the best mysteries available. It is in the length of the story - most especially the length of the writing that will probably cause many readers to balk. The descriptions, the conversations, the ideas... virtually everything is pondered at length. Reading this in today's society, where TV, the internet, pictures, videos etc. etc. grant us instant understanding and gratification, can be a tedious and boring job. In order to truly appreciate Collins writing, one must put themselves in the shoes of a reader amid 19th century standards. Most people knew little of life outside their small communities. Few traveled or had experience with people and places beyond the immediate. Thus the need for long explanations and descriptions. It was the only door open for a reader to experience life beyond.   A perfect example would be the description of Count Fosco, a very large Itallian man. His description was so intricate and detailed as to take pages (not paragraphs - pages.) To us, that description might seem never-ending. To one who had probably never seen, let alone known an Italian man - good or bad - it described one so perfectly that the reader (without our modern day photography) could picture him with ease.   Therefore, any accurate review of this book must allow for those differences. Readers who enjoy the beauty of the written word just for itself will absolutely revel in this story. Those who are more story driven will need to put on their patience caps to get through it. The story itself is immaculately well-done, it is dark without being terrifying, riveting without being graphic. It is just couched within a style long forgotten and truly appreciated.

0143113100|5.0|This is my \\"Book of Hope\\". Rarely do I read a book that is beautifully written and easily read, but which also changes my understanding and fills me with hope.<br /><br />The mantra when I entered Medical School, in 1965, was that as we approached early adulthood, we possessed about 10 10 or 100,000,000,000 nerve cells, and that the links between them were already formed. From early adulthood, we basically lost around 1000 cells per day, and by old age, this accumulated reduction in the number of cells caused us to lose our faculties and to wither away, and that was that!<br /><br />I remember a friend of mine in the early 70's saying he was going to specialize in Neurology, as we were entering the era of knowledge of the Brain. Well, he will be retiring around now, but the beginning of the era of increased understanding the Brain is upon us.<br /><br />We now know the Brain is not a static organ, but is capable of great flexibility or \\"Plasticity\\". Dr Norman Doidge, a Canadian-born psychiatrist and medical researcher, has written a wonderful summary of the physicians, scientists, individuals, who have contributed to our new understanding of the plasticity of the brain, and of the technologies, where we can see the changes in the brain occurring.<br /><br />Brain Plasticity gives so many folk new hope - those with stroke recovery needs, psychiatric problems, learning disabilities and for those of us Boomers, who will have to learn new knowledge and skills, our brain is capable of learning anew, of making new neurons and connecting new pathways. It isn't easy and indeed may take a considerable effort and persistence to alter pathways and re-tool our brains, but much can be done.<br /><br />So, read this book and revel in the exciting prospect of the beginnings of a new era for our understanding of the brain, and with it the awareness that we can change ourselves.<br /><br />Two Canadian Broadcasting Company documentaries on the \\"Brain that Changes Itself\\" can be found at the \\"Nature of Things\\" and are available for viewing on line. Sadly, I feel the first documentary, which is a summary of the book, is poorly presented, fragmented and doesn't smoothly tell the tale as in the book. The second documentary \\"Changing Your Mind\\" with case studies is better, but I guess the problem is that the medium of television can never offer the detail and understanding that can be obtained from a book.line.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I got this today on the Free App of the Day promotion.  I like OfficeSuite Pro 5 a lot.  This is a good mobile office app in my opinion.  I took the time to download it on my three Android devices, (HTC Flyer, Samsung Vibrant and Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0), and it works perfectly on them all.  I really need this on my HTC Flyer because the Polaris Office app that came preinstalled doesn't have all the features of OfficeSuite Pro 5.  I tested this on my Word, Excel, PowerPoint and text files and they all opened without a problem. This will also open PDF files.  I tested it on a sample PDF comic book I have and it handled the graphic intensive pages very well.  This app is optimized for tablet use, so I can see little differnces smartphone UI (Samsung Vibrant & Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0) and tablet UI (HTC Flyer).  The smartphone UI is for a smaller screen, so there are few opt.  I especially like the start page when you open the app on a tablet like the HTC Flyer.  On left hand side it lists these options:  Recent files (browse you recently used files)  My Documents (your default document folder)  Local Files (files stored on memory card)  Ext SD (files stored on external storage)  Remote files (files stored on remote locations)  Download dictionaries (dictionaries to look up work meanings)  This is a great feature because it allows me an easier way to look up my files.  I prefer to leave my documents on my SD card in case my device breaks, so I set my default document folder to one labeled \\"Files\\" on my SD card.  I recommend this app to anyone looking for a good mobile office app for their Android device.
0143117009|5.0|First, Professor Jared Diamond wrote \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", an account of the rise of civilizations, also a book I enjoyed but his sequel, \\"Collapse\\", an account of why civilizations fail, I found much more compelling, perhaps as it is prescient of our current turmoil. Prof Diamond writes well with clarity and I still feel that every high school and adult should read this book, at least to stimulate thought and discussion.<br /><br />Dr Diamond does not argue that our contemporary world will collapse, although he admits to seeing many concerning signs. The book was published in 2005, when the writing was writ on the wall in large letters, warning of our current downturn for anyone who cared to actually look at the wall. However, denial is arguably the greatest human characteristic and few looked at the wall, Dr Diamond's caveats about societies' behavior, past and present, went largely unnoticed but if you haven't read it yet, perhaps it is timely to do so now.

0143116177|4.0|Niall Ferguson has become one of the strange animals - an academic celebrity, which often brings a sense of unease to other academics. But they are a great asset, as they have the ability to crystallize their subject and explain it to us, who otherwise would not have a chance to dip into the subject.<br /><br />In the \\"Ascent of Money\\", Niall Ferguson has written and entertaining book on the history of money from Mesopotamian times to the present. Published in a timely fashion in 2008, as the World descended into its latest \\"Bust\\", this book provides a good overview of how and when money and financial products developed. The narrative is interlaced with tales of men, who contributed to or were destructive of these systems, institutions and/or countries and as always with a historical overview, we are left wondering why we never learn from our past. Sadly, the answer is most likely that we either do not know our past or think \\"This time it will be different\\" - and it never is!

B0053YGYO4|1.0|If you've got any previous recordings of this group, then don't bother with this one. The promo may tell you it's something different - but it's not! Overall, it's  still the loud electric distorted guitar (except one acoustic track), same beat, same drawling vocals (except two wee instrumentals, which somehow got their own titles & will annoy anyone with MP player set to 'random'). If it wasn't for the few seconds between tracks, you'd think the whole album was a 50 min single! If they don't get a bit more variety in their performance & voice (even a backing vocal would help), then I think they'll soon be approaching their expiry date.

B0009HLD0K|5.0|Over 30 years later and this is still the best cycling movie ever made.  Steve Tesich did a masterful job with his screenplay.  He deserved the award he got.  The cycling scenes, for any serious cyclist, are unparalled.  Enjoing a ride in the greenness of Indiana rolling hills....and then a flat.  Priceless.  Learning that everbody cheats,  drafting behind a semi,  the rigors of training.  This film has it all.  It remains the best cycling film ever made.

B004DSX5B6|3.0|I haven't found this tool particularly outstanding. Regular components, nothing to write home about.<br />I agree, springed plyers are bettr than non-springed, and having tools vavilable from the outside can also be a minor convenience. Comparing to what I already had (a non-name el-cheapo one) it was essentially the same, bar a slightly better grip and the sheath.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you don't have a tool like that - it can be a decent purchase. If you already have something like that - spend your money elsewhere...

B005GUQIDC|5.0|Ever since her collaboration with Miami Horror in the hit \\"I Look To You\\" I just new this girl had something coming. Been   waiting for her release since forever...and now I finally had the chance to listen to it. Just wonderful! A marvelous   orchestration of gargantuan or diminutive sounds here and there which are better appreciated with good headphones. I think she  even teamed up with björk for a bit as well, and did a swell track with her.   Tracks that stand out:   / Settle down  / Cameo Lover  / Call Me (which has this awesome kind of funky hip-hop feel to it!)   Five stars!

B00003CXZ1|5.0|When the Mayan Calendar ends, it will be the end of the last 5125 year cycle when the calendar flips over to 13.0.0.0.0 or  13 B'ak'Tuns  In the 2001 Lara Croft: Tomb Raider movie, the protagonist Lara Croft had to recover two pieces of a Triangle of Light, which controls time itself, before it falls into the hands of the Illuminati.  Near the beginning of the movie, Croft finds a special clock which has several rotating rings and four compass-like points, very similar to the construction of the circular Mayan Calendar.  While recovering the first piece of the Triangle, Croft tells the antagonist if he puts the timer in the wrong place in the temple, they'll have to wait about another 5,000 years for the planets to be aligned once again.  5,000 Years is very close to the time period of 1 B'ak'tun on the Mayan Calendar.  Near the end of the movie when the Triangle is completed, both Croft and the antagonist are transported to an alternate reality with a large step pyramid with the triangle hovering in mid-air at the peak of the pyramid just like the All Seeing Eye on the Great Seal of the United States.  The step pyramid looks very similar to the step pyramid used by the Mayans to measure time for their long count calendar.  The same pyramid is seen earlier in the movie during a flashback sequence where Croft's father is explaining the Triangle of Light.  Once Croft obtains the Triangle of Light, she uses it to visit her deceased father, save her friend from death and attack the antagonist before shooting and destroying the triangle.    Many researchers on the Mayan Calendar believe once the calendar ends, people will have control over what they manifest in their lives as well as the flow of time itself as applied to alternate realities and parallel universes.  This seems to be the theme of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|My first review complained about this dictionary not working. The problem has been sorted out a long time ago, and I can easily say I am glad I bought this book. I read mainly crime fiction and this dictionary covers around 80% of the words I look up. That's enough for me to understand difficult sentences etc. The remaining 20% or so words I just highlight and look up later.
B004EPZ084|4.0|Work has its ups and downs, but there are those that just don't want to get up in the morning because they just hate their boss. Now, imagine if you will where you have officially had enough to the point where you want to kill your boss. That is the story of `Horrible Bosses'.<br /><br />`Horrible Bosses' is a simple to follow story with lots of laughs and it really isn't the most original comedy out there. However, what makes this film so great is the amazing ensemble cast that is in this film. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day & Jason Sudekas are brilliant together and give us one great laugh after another. Then you have the bosses played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston & Collin Ferral. What did it for me was Jennifer Aniston whom I am not a fan of, but to see her playing the outrageous role of the nymphomaniac dentist was some of the most impressive acting I have ever seen from her.<br /><br />While this movie is very funny, it is far from perfect. The story was not as great as `Bridesmaids' and Jennifer Aniston & Collin Ferral were very underused. I would have loved to see the two of them more in the movie because I loved what I saw in the parts they were in throughout the film. Still, you will get your laughs from this one and it was one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time and believe me where comedy is heading these days it's a real challenge to find a good one.<br /><br />FYI, I hate blu ray even more because they don't even put the unrated edition on DVD that's terrible.

B005G4TJUC|1.0|Why would you take a franchise that had so much promise, and turn it into a monstrosity of a movie?<br /><br />When the first Transformers film was released back in 2007 as an `80s child I was highly anticipating my shape shifting robots on the big screen. When I found out that they took the time to gather Peter Cullen to go back to his roots and voice Optimus Prime I was awestruck. After a fantastic film that didn't really give me enough robots that I anticipated I was eager for more. Then came `Revenge of the Fallen' More robots, intense action, but unfortunately more humans and horrible acting in a over 2 hour film. After that a promise was made by Michael Bay that the third film was going to be one of the greatest action films ever and yes there would be more robots and more character development.<br /><br />`Dark of the Moon' came, there were some amazing action sequences, and yes more robots...BUT...no plot, no acting skill and just a bunch of special effects and explosions to cover the mess all up. This movie has the word fail written all over it I don't even want to purchase this DVD. Hell, this movie makes `Revenge of the Fallen' look good and that says a lot! At this point I am devastated after 4 years of what could have been one of the greatest stories ever told on film based on a true animation revolution, I was left with disgust and sheer disappointment. Take these movies...maybe not the first and bury them deep underground and let's never speak of them again. If there is a Transformers 4 or a Transformers reboot, you can bet your money that I will not be sitting in that theater.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|If you're like me the first thing that strikes you as you read this book is that Steve Jobs led a mythological life.<br /><br />Put up for closed adoption by unmarried parents who eventually married, rejected by the first would be adoptive parents, then adopted by working class parents, it would be difficult to conceive a more inauspicious beginning, or a more auspicious outcome. Steve Jobs would grow up to prove that an apple can fall quite far from the tree, and still blossom. Abandoned, the chosen one, special.<br /><br />Firstly, I don't think there is any such thing as an illegitimate child, only illegitimate parents.<br /><br />The public life and business achievements have been well chronicled, and I didn't want to read a book about Apple. I wondered about the family life, the relationship with Bill Gates, were they collaborators or competitors.  iWondered how much of Apple's great accomplishments were due to Jobs, what effect his passing would have on the future of Apple.  I wondered about how he got the Beatles music, and the reputedly fractious relationship with Apple records.<br /><br />Isaacson has constructed a fascinating about a mercurial man. My opinion of Jobs did not change much as a result of reading this book.  He already struck me as being a highly driven type A personality, narcissistic, aggressive, perfectionistic.  Certainly these traits contributed to both his successes and his setbacks, and made him a difficult man to get along with, but those high standards imposed by a passion for the product and a drive for perfection, and a demanding lack of compassion, would also draw out of people improved abilities, enhanced creativity, and greater accomplishments. I admire some of his methods of monetising ideas, and how he created his own reality.<br /><br />Certainly, Isaacson's unvarnished portrait, means many people will not find Jobs the man appealing, and will not condone certain of his behaviors, and I commend Jobs for his honesty in allowing that.  Perhaps the biggest surprise that he let go of his controlling tendencies, and did not seek to approve the book.<br /><br />Ironically at age 22, he would find himself in the exact same position as his birth parents at that age, and would not acknowledge his out of wedlock child Lisa. He would eventually reverse that position before Apple went public agreeing to a DNA test, and making an arrangement. I was interested to discover that he has a  lost sister Mona Simpson, an author who has written a book, [[ASIN:0679772715 A Regular Guy : A Novel]], the main character based on Jobs and the relationship with his daughter Lisa.<br /><br />Nemesis follows hubris with a punishing fall from grace at Apple, betrayed by his hand picked underling, fired by the company he founded, exiled, buying Pixar off George Lucas for $5 million, selling it to Disney for a reputed $500 million, eventually returning as conquering hero to regain his throne. After many lean years the kingdom would once again prosper.<br /><br />Among his influences, The Beatles, particularly John Lennon, also rejected by both his parents, and raised by an aunt.  The Beatles being greater than the sum of the individual parts would inpsire his own management style of making better products through teamwork. Perhaps more surprising was his relating to Captain Ahab from Moby Dick, and that despotic tyrant King Lear.<br /><br />The strength of this book, unfettered access to Jobs, uncensored commentary and insights, of family, friends, business associates, even enemies, and critics.<br /><br />I enjoyed  how he met his wife Laurene Powell.  Her name is quite similar to my name, Laurence Power, and she has a degree in Economics.  I enjoyed the humor and pranks of the early days with Wosniak, such as illicitly mimicing long distance beeps to make free long distance calls, calling the Vatican free pretending to be Kissinger, collecting bootleg Dylan recordings. I also enjoyed reading of the reality distortionfield sometimes employed effectively, sometimes not.  He would one day meet his father in a restaurant but neither would be aware that they met.<br /><br />If you're wondering about hardback v Kindle, Kindle has photos.  Unlike the book which has a central montage the photos on Kindle are present at the beginning of chapters.  Given the price differential between both is so small,  I recommend the hardback, as you can resell and regift a hardback, although on the Kindle I like the search features and the ability to search and collect quotes, and make notes and highlights.  If you don't already have Kindle, you can download the app here at Amazon, and get a free book sample.  By the time you finish reading the sample I predict you will want to read the rest of the book.<br /><br />The book did answer most of my questions, yet I do not give it five stars.  Here is why:<br /><br />I own several quotation books.  When I learned Jobs illness was fatal, I looked  up quotes by Jobs.<br /><br />Some quotation books such as Bartlett, and Forbes Business quotes, have no Jobs quotes. Oxford and Yale each have two.  Most quote books have few if any quotes by business leaders. Hopefully, that will change. I found [[ASIN:1841120081 The Ultimate Book of Investment Quotations (The Ultimate Series)]] to be the only decent book that quotes business leaders and investment experts.  An important word in both Gates and Jobs vocabulary is innovation, an important characteristic reinvention.<br /><br />If you look at the Stanford commencement speech, on youtube, Jobs has many good quotes, shares his wisdom, talks of the importance of curiosity and intuition.  Stay hungry.  Stay foolish.  I understand there are about 100 books due to be published about Jobs.<br /><br />While Isaacson's book contains many good quotes, most of these are by other people about Jobs, by Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Andy Grove, Al Gore and many others.  Perhaps my favorite was the Herman Hermits quote by Bono.  What I found curiously lacking were great quotes by Jobs himself.  Watching the Stanford speech on youtube, I wrote down six or seven quotes from that speech alone.  Isaacson references it but barely quotes it.<br /><br />Certainly, he could have sprinkled some of Jobs best quotes throughout the book.  With that I would definitely give five stars.  Hopefully, future editions and printings will address this.  That would make both an honest depiction and a fitting tribute to a great visionary.  I wonder given the platforms and innovations of Jobs, would it not be possible to create a multimedia publication with embedded clips and sound bites from Jobs, and others.<br /><br />Jobs: The Beatles all want to be on iTunes, but they and EMI are like an old married couple.  They hate each other but can't get divorced.<br /><br />Jobs: Picasso had a saying, good artists copy, great artists steal.<br /><br />Alan Kay maxim adopted by Jobs: The best way to predict the future is to invent it.<br /><br />Gates:  Well Steve, I think there's more than one way of looking at it.  I think it's more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox, and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already taken it.<br /><br />Tim Cook,  Apple CEO:  I realised very early that if you didn't voice your opinion he would mow you down.  He takes contrary positions to create more discussion because it may lead to a better result.  So, if you don't feel comfortable disagreeing, then you'll never survive.<br /><br />Mona Simpson:  Love was his supreme virtue, his god of gods. He tracked and worried about the romantic lives of the people working with him.<br /><br />I recommend [[ASIN:B005UQLLCU I, Steve: Steve Jobs in His Own Words]]as a companion book because it's irresistibly priced on Kindle, and full of Steve Jobs quotes. Both books together give a five star overview of Jobs.  According to Amazon many people buy both books.<br /><br />Given the success of The Social Network written by Aaron Sorkin, it seems obvious that Steve Jobs life could be made into a movie.  He was friends with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, and the mythology, the amounts at stake in business, the conflict, competition, triumphs, setbacks, and turning points would make a great movie, which I for one would watch.<br /><br />While reading, three quotes by George Bernard Shaw came to mind:<br /><br />The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him.  The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself.  All progress depends on the unreasonable man.<br /><br />If I give you an apple, and you give me an apple we each have an apple.  If I give you an idea, and you give me an idea, we each have two ideas.  Jobs certainly turned apples and ideas into dollars).<br /><br />Some people see things as they are and ask why.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|The finale that we have awaited for, for the past 10 years has finally arrived. Harry Potter has been through quite a lot in his past 6 years at Hogwarts, but now it is time to make the full transition from child to adult.<br /><br />For the first time in film history a film based on a single piece of literature has been broken in two in order to bring the entire story safely to film. `Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1' shows us all the steps taken to the final showdown between Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort. With it comes many challenges and hurdles for Harry and his friends to overcome.  This film, while many call it a 3 hour filler is probably the most overlooked of all the films. This part of the story has some of the most incredible acting and character development seen in the past 6 films. With some amazing heartfelt moments that cause a rollercoaster of emotional states. I am quite surprised that this film gets so much flack. Now that I have seen Part 2 and I can firmly state that this section of the final chapter is in fact the better movie. I was more on edge watching this film than the second and maybe that is because I am one that really appreciates acting more than action. Not, that there wasn't good acting in the second part, but you will have to wait for my final Harry Potter film review when ` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is officially released on DVD and Blu Ray.<br /><br />I also keep stating that I have a major beef with Blu Ray. Before Blu Ray was released they managed to give us just as many special features on DVDs and now since Blu Ray at least to me is nothing but a space saver the film industry is literally taking a massive dump on DVDs. I have watched DVDs and yes the picture is clearer, but it is the film itself that makes me enjoy what they are.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Those Sunday shoes can be a little tiresome, especially when you are forced to wear them all week long.<br /><br />Ren McCarthy arrives in the small town of Bomont, soon discovers dances are banned following a tragic accident several years earlier in which five high schoolers were killed.  Not only that, the blaring of music as you drive your car along a country road can get you fined.  He butts heads with police, preacher, and headmaster soon after.  He meets the attractive rebellious yet troubled preachers daughter, Ariel, played by Julianne Hough who blanks him.<br /><br />Somewhere in town highschoolers can go and blare some music, but before long the authorities appear.  Ren dances and catches the eye of Ariel.  Her brother died in the accident, messing her up, and she acts out, thrillseeking, dangerously self destructive, she dates the local bad boy.  As the attraction grows, conflicts arise with both the preacher, and the bad boy.  Will Ren get her?  Will she change her ways?  Will they do the mambo?  If you're like me these are some of the questions that run through your mind as you watch this movie.<br /><br />You have to watch the movie to find out.  Not having previously seen the original Footloose, I was curious to see this because of Julianne Hough, who has won twice on Dancing with the stars, and is a world champion ballroom dancer.  Kenny Wormald I had not heard of before.  He has danced professionally with some of the world's top entertainers such as Justin Timberlake, and I believe Mariah Carey.  I found his performance in his first leading role engaging, and clearly he has great dance skills.  Somewhat to my surprise I was impressed by the acting performance of Julianne Hough, she delivers in the several great emotional scenes this movie offers, particularly when she gets slapped.  I knew she could dance, and I did not recognise her in Burlesque, because she wore a brunette wig, but I think she could have a decent career as a leading movie actress.  Beyond her obvious appeal, she has some depth.<br /><br />In some respects this is better than the original, particularly the storytelling, which includes the inciting incident of the accident at the beginning, and some of the dancing particularly by Kenny Wormald and others were very good.  What surprised me given the talent of Hough is that she was underused in a dancing capacity, and had no solo to speak of.<br /><br />In some respects the original is better, particularly the depth of acting talent, which includes well known actors such as John Lithgow, and Dianne Wiest, as the preacher and his wife, whose characters were three dimensional, Kevin Bacon, of course, Sarah Jessica Parker in a supporting role as Ariel's friend, and a scene stealing Christopher Penn, Sean Penn's brother.<br /><br />The best known actors in the new version are Dennis Quaid, and Angie McDowell, yet somehow the director played down the role of these characters so that they are one dimensional.<br /><br />I think most people will enjoy both versions, with a new movie updated soundtrack with new artists.  I think the remake was worthwhile, because this version will appeal to a new generation that was not even alive when the first movie was made.  I think though we are seeing too many remakes this year.<br /><br />If you want to watch another dance movie,  I recommend [[ASIN:B00000IPHT The Red Shoes - Criterion Collection]], one of the greatest dance movies ever made.he has some depth.

B003L77G6A|5.0|`The Big Bang Theory' has become a staple in my television viewing since it first aired and after the past season I was glad to know that the show somewhat redeemed itself from an average second season. This time I am happy to say that season four has added a brand new dimension and that is the addition of more nerdy women!<br /><br />We only had Penny as a staple female role and she was the polar opposite of our nerdy foursome. When you add the characters of the cute, but not so naive Bernadette and Sheldon in the female form of Amy Fara Fowler, it causes the Big Bang Theory to explode with more hilarity. It is so great to see just how women change these lovable characters in ways you never thought possible. Each episode just made me laugh and it just got better with every new one.<br /><br />I recommend this show to anyone I know. While it may not be appealing to everyone, it is still one of the most original sitcoms to grace the small screen in a while.
B004W2UBYW|1.0|Of course Jobs will be remembered as a pioneer in the field of technology, but this book is so depressing. The author is a mediocre writer at best-adds about as much life to his writing as his subject lived. There is absolutely nothing in the life of Jobs that is worth emulating. I suspect that one day he will be remembered not just as an inventor-actually he did not invent-just market the ideas of others-but as an exambple of how much character declined in our time. He gave up on God because of starving children, yet he had so much and not only did he fail to help the poor odf the world bit went out of his way to torpedo people who worked for him.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|In film DC Comics only brought us one too many versions of Superman & Batman. While a few other comic characters from this company have made it to film like `Watchmen' & `Hellblazer' Still, where are all the other popular DC characters? Our prayers were finally answered this summer with `Green Lantern'<br /><br />First off, I am a huge Green Lantern fan. I love the story and I love the fact that a hero so simple can have such a deep complex life as well as a very deep story. This movie was huge, because the entire DC franchise was weighing it. Success would bring all the other major DC names to the big screen finally. Unfortunately, this film is not the greatest. The acting was not the greatest, but thank goodness Ryan Reynolds was able to do a decent job. Blake was not lively at all as Carol Ferris and Marc Strong who played Sinestro barley got any screen time. The other weakness of the film while it was strength to me was the story. The story of Green Lantern goes far beyond the ring, there is a whole world full of Green Lanterns that protect the entire universe and a story like that may not sit well with people whom have never read the comic and no nothing of the lore. Green Lantern fans will appreciate that aspect, but at the same time will not be entirely satisfied due to the subpar acting.<br /><br />There is a great deal of potential for a sequel to be a better film, especially with the cliffhanger ending. The only problem is due to box office failure, there may not be another film. Still, `Green Lantern' is a fun film and I own it and after seeing it a second I still feel the same way. It is a fun film that the true fan will enjoy, with of potential to be better.<br /><br />Again this is a horrible DVD and I blame it on Blu Ray, there are next to know decent special features and you can only get the extended edition on Blu Ray...shame shame.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|I finished reading it two short days after it was first available.  My wide eyed teen self loved the original Apple II.  31 years later and a day before his death, in a heaving Apple Store of his design, I walked out with a Macbook. How can this man be gone? How did he do it? Read the book.  Unfortunately I believe the editing may have been rushed. To take one trivial but annoying example the word lapidary is used twice in short succession (describing the skills of both Jobs and Gates). More than one event is re-told to the reader. Overall, I found the writing style dull, it lacked the fireworks of the subject. Luckily Jobs is on every page, making things interesting.  The book at first seems long but not when you subtract the large index, and other supporting pages. This isn't any problem except there are giant holes left for future biographers. An example: AT&T is not even mentioned in the text! There are is nothing written on how Jobs convinced The Phone Company to cede so much control to the iphone. I feel like Jobs revealed a lot of his early life but the last 10 years, the most productive and interesting ones, were mainly and sketchily told through the eyes of others. At one point it is revealed that Apple has 70,000 workers in China and 15,000 engineer managers (a figure not even available to hire in the USA). I'm sure Jobs was all over this, yet there is no further exploration.  In retrospect I found the constant repetition of the Jobs reality distortion zone, and his habit of being cruel, well ... repetitive! By his third cruel action honestly all that can be said about unkind Steve had been said. Subsequent speculations on his personal motivations and so on never added anything new.  One thought on the legacy of Jobs: Isaacson concludes that despite his flaws, he deserves to be alongside greats in the industrialist hall of fame and you'd have to be a mean spirited or jealous person to disagree with that assessment. Yet I wonder if the greats of yesterday would survive their life, and particular personal flaws, examined and documented in such detail. I'm still in awe of what Jobs did with his life, he more than lived up to his own marketing.  PS: It is a shame that the book does not come with links to youtube videos and other supporting information. For many of the key events and people in the book if you search you can find the original material (videos etc) that are so much more than the paragraph that describes them.  I stopped frequently and switched to a browser.  What a shame the e-book about such an amazing (and tech oriented) life, describing the pursuit of perfection, could not include even one link.
B0034G4P80|4.0|The long awaited `Avengers' project moves forward once more, this time bringing a whole new dimension to the Marvel Universe. From the heavens of Norse legend, comes `Thor'. The God of Thunder awaiting to become the omnipotent leader of the 7 realms is cast out due to his selfishness and left powerless on the planet of Earth. There he has to understand that there is much more to being a God than just sitting on your thrown and getting your way.<br /><br />For a film that is build around so much grandeur than the past few films linked to this story, I was impressed with how grounded it was. Amongst the action there is excellent character development from a well assembled cast. Chris Hemsworth is truly Thor and the way he portrays the boastfulness is fantastic. Natalie Portman always does a great job and with every new role she brings something different. Tom Hiddleson was a perfect Loki, unknowns always seem to the best when it comes to breakthrough performances. The thing that I loved the most about this film was the fact that it was so relatable and funny. There are some moments that just had me laughing. Kat Dennings while she really doesn't have a significant character has some of the best comic timing in the film and that is what makes her character relevant.<br /><br />`Thor' is a winner and it was one of the best films that I saw this summer and all the surprises that are thrown into this movie just make me more excited for the day The Avengers assemble.
1451648537|4.0|I have to say my wife really enjoys this book so far. But the blank hardcover pissed me off. The cheap jacket is the only graphic content on the cover. And the spine is even reverse!
0670022411|5.0|I loved this book.   It was nice to read a book that danced in the supernatural and the real world without being self-indulgent or unintelligent. Harkness made me very glad to have bought her book on a whim after spotting it on my way out of a bookstore.  I wish I'd known it was part of a trilogy just starting so I wouldn't have read it so quickly now having to wait for the next book.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Rick Riordan's since I first started reading Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and I can't stop loving his writing. I mean, really, who writes the words (no spoilers) \\"Hazel felt like she'd been plugged into a wall socket.\\"? I love it! And I definitely recommend this and Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and The Kane Chronicles. To be more technical, the \\"writing\\" is good, as in the only grammatical issue I had is it said \\"till\\" rather then \\"'til\\". The story moves at a good pace and is interesting. I, personally, am very interested in mythology, and I read a lot of YA fiction, and them being put together so well, and set in the modern day, is like a dream come true!<br /><br />I'm also a big fan of the authors Stephanie Collins (The Hunger Games), Scott Westerfield (Uglies, Leviathan), and Pittacus Lore (Lorien Legacies). Now the thing is, these are really nothing alike, but they're other books/series/authors that I think of when I think of The Hero's of Olympus. So it may not help, but I thought I'd throw it in just in case.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I don't make a habit of watching Leonardo DiCaprio films, but the premise of Shutter Island intrigued me.  It looked like a dark and moody thriller, and that's exactly what it turned out to be.  Setting the story in the 1950s grants the film a strong film noir quality that works hand in hand with the gritty cinematography to produce an atmosphere that mirrors the psychological darkness hanging over the entire story.  This is a place with more than a few similarities to Alcatraz, and much of the story takes place during hurricane-like conditions that only intensify the lonely desperation of a place completely cut off from the normal world.<br /><br />DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. marshal who goes to Boston Harbor's Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital.  Rachel Solando is no ordinary patient, and Ashecliffe is no ordinary hospital.  Shutter Island, you see, is home to the criminally insane, the kind of people that society and the system - but not Drs. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) - have given up on.  They are on the cutting edge of psychiatric medicine and are attempting to rehabilitate the likes of Rachel, who bought her ticket there by drowning her three kids in the lake behind her home.  The case is not an easy one for Daniels.  He's working with a brand new partner in Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), the docs aren't all that generous in terms of sharing data on the patients and staff members, and it looks very much as if Rachel Solando simply disappeared into thin air.  Daniels also harbors some psychological demons inside his own head - his disturbing memories from the liberation of Dachau and the death of his young wife.  He also has an ulterior motive for being there, as he has reason to believe the man responsible for his wife's death is there on the island.  Additionally, his research into Ashecliffe makes him suspect that the good doctors there are actually up to no good at all, conducting the kinds of research and tests that the Nazis pioneered during the Third Reich.<br /><br />The plot takes a number of unsettling twists and turns, as Scorsese brilliantly manipulates the audience in a number of mesmerizing ways, constructing a psychological labyrinth of sudden dead ends and hidden chambers.  Every time you think you have the story figured out, it twists away from you in a new direction.  You're routinely left wondering what is real and what is imagined throughout the film's 138 minute runtime.  It takes a great script, a great director, and a great actor to make a film like this work, and Shutter Island is blessed with all of the above.  Leo's not one of my favorites, but I do concede the fact that he is a talented actor.  Brilliantly conceived and executed, Shutter Island is a thinking man's suspense thriller that leaves certain aspects of the story open to interpretation even after the final truth is revealed.  As such, it is one of those rare films that prove just as fascinating the second time through as it was the first.ds of research and tests that the Nazis pioneered during the Third Reich.

0691152640|2.0|On April 15, 2013, a year and a half after I had first published this review a study by Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin from the U of Massachusetts came out and refutted the authors main thesis that once a country reaches a Debt/GDP ratio of 90% sees its economic growth contract nearly automatically.  This had become a covenant of libertarians such as Paul Ryan and Europeans promoting fiscal austerity.  It turns out that Reinhart and Rogoff studies were completely wrong.  R&R made numerous mistakes pointed out by the U of Mass team.  The main one was to exclude three years out of the New Zealand data during a high Debt/GDP period.  During those three excluded years New Zealand had grown very rapidly which contradicted R&R thesis.  Once you make those corrections (including a few others that were minute by comparison), there is no statistical difference in growth rate between countries with high Debt/GDP ratio vs ones with lower ones.  So much for Austerity.  This is a devastating blow to what we thought was a classic study on the subject.  Below see my original review.  Notice that I had also observed many other flaws with their work but not the one mentioned above since I never saw the data firsthand.<br /><br />This book is both fascinating and flawed.  Starting with the flaws:<br /><br />First, the book is mistitled.  It covers the last 200 years not the last 800.<br /><br />Second, their crisis framework is convoluted relative to the crystal clear framework of Charles Kindleberger in [[ASIN:0471467146 Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises (Wiley Investment Classics)]].  The latter leans on the seminal work of Irving Fisher [[ASIN:1453624457 The Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions]] and Hyman Minsky (the credit cycle exacerbates the business cycle) that the authors completely ignore.<br /><br />Third, some of their analyses are obfuscating.  They baffle the reader on how frequently emerging market countries default with surprisingly low external debt levels.  Later, the authors clarify that debt levels are far higher when including domestic debt; then the baffling turns into the self-evident.<br /><br />Fourth, in Chapter 16, their development of a crisis index measure is weak with no predictive power.  The first two graphs capturing this index (ranging from 1 to 5) over the past 100 years have the wrong y-axis (ranging from 0 to 180?) rendering the graph incomprehensible (pg. 253, 254).  Two pages later, they use the correct scale (1 - 5).<br /><br />Fifth, the graph on page 267 denoting the % collapse of exports during the Great Depression has the wrong sign.<br /><br />Sixth, some of their conclusions are already outdated.  They advance that Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain are all doing better than in recent years.  The book came out in 2009; didn't those countries show signs of fiscal stress?  Since 1800, Greece suffered external debt defaults or rescheduling in over 50% of the years.<br /><br />Seventh, their argument that large Current Account Deficits (CADs) fuel housing bubbles is not supported.  When they show the magnitude of the rise in housing prices over 2002 - 2006 for many countries (Fig. 15.1), it is unclear if there are any relationship between high CAD and housing Bubbles.  The housing bubble was far greater in many former USSR satellites than anywhere else (unclear if they had high CADs).<br /><br />Moving on to the ambivalent OK parts:<br /><br />1) Their early warning indicators of banking and currency crises (Table 17.1) are interesting.  They indicate that 12 month changes in real housing and stock prices are good early signals for banking crises.  They mention other metrics such as CAD levels.  But, those indicators are unsupported by any statistical analysis.<br /><br />Moving on to the good parts:<br /><br />1) Their prototype sequencing of crises represents their best work.  It shows how a nation can experience in succession financial deregulation, banking crisis, currency crash, inflation spike, and ultimately default.  The tipping point is when a government faces an untenable choice between defending its currency (restrictive policies) and shoring up its financial sector (expansive policies).  Governments invariably abandon supporting their currency.<br /><br />2) Their historical data facilitate interesting observations:<br /><br />2a) Crisis related to sovereign risks are so frequent, you wonder how countries ever manage to raise debt.  While developed countries have \\"graduated\\" from defaults, they have not from banking crises.  Since 1800, the UK, US, and France have experienced 12, 13, and 15 episodes of banking crises.  Banking crises have been frequent since the 1980s.  Developed countries are prone to banking crises because financial deregulation is a causal factor.  In 18 of 26 banking crises observed since 1970, the financial sector had been liberalized within the preceding 5 years.<br /><br />2b) Post WWII financial crises have been severe.  On average, real housing prices decline by 35% over 6 years; stocks crash by 56% over 3.5 years; unemployment rate increases by 7 percentage points; GDP contracts by 9%; and, public debt rises by 86%.<br /><br />2c) The US Subprime crisis was more severe than any other post WWII financial crisis.  Its housing and stock market bubbles were more pronounced.  The US CAD as a % of GDP was larger.  The downturn in GDP was more severe.  The resulting increase in public debt was faster.  The ramp up of all mentioned indicators suggested a financial crisis was imminent.  The authors remark that if the US had been an emerging market relying on external debt (in foreign currency), the US dollar value would have plummeted and interest rates soared.<br /><br />3) When the authors move on to the US Subprime crisis, they note how the majority of experts, including Bernanke and Greenspan, were not concerned regarding the rising US Current Account Deficit (CAD) and rising housing prices.  These experts stated the CAD and home price increases were associated with a World savings glut resulting from Asian export led economies.  Meanwhile others (Rubini, Krugman, and the authors) were concerned about the CAD sustainability (absorbing 2/3d of World savings), housing prices (in real term rose by 92% between 1996 and 2006 or more than 3 x the 27% increase from 1890 to 1996!  See graph pg. 207) and the massive increase in US household debt (rose from a norm of 80% of personal income to 130% by 2006).<br /><br />If you are interested in this subject, I also recommend Raghuram Rajan's [[ASIN:0691152632 Fault Lines: How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy [New in Paper]]].king crisis, currency crash, inflation spike, and ultimately default.

The item description above says it is 2.40:1, but before I read that, I thought it was 2.35:1.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also excellent - lot's of surround sounds and sub-woofer bass.<br /><br />The movie lasted about 1 hour and 47 minutes.  I thought it was pretty good, except for the ending, which I thought was incomplete.
0143122010|5.0|We all read about horrible violence and cruelty in the news every day, so it may seem counterintuitive to read a book proving that rates of violence among human beings are steadily going down, and have been for centuries. I found this to be an optimistic yet fact-based look at how the human race, as a whole, is evolving to be more empathic. This is a densely academic book, full of statistics, charts and graphs, therefore I don't recommend downloading to an old-style Kindle. The facts about the decline of violence don't let us be complacent, but rather, give us a guide as to how humanity can continue to evolve in the right direction.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD and Ripped in 30. While one reviewer noted that this DVD is not more challenging than a one-hour cardio class at the gym, the point is you do not have to go to the gym to do it! And you only need 20-30 minutes. I am a working mother and I do not have 2-3 hours it requires to get to the gym to do a class.  Before this video I did not work out because I did not think I had the time.  Now, I work out 5-6 times a week because it takes so little time and can be done in my house, with my kids at home.  If you are able to get to the gym regularly to do a cardio class, then you are right--this DVD may not be for you.  However, if you don't have time for that, this DVD is for you. There's no way you cannot find 20-30 minutes a day, in your living room, to do it. No excuses!  Jillian's DVDs have been incredibly effective for me.

B0048WQDIE|5.0|I had this on my \\"To Read\\" list for a long time but I had been putting it off. So then I found it on Kindle and finally I had the chance to read it. I admit I chose it because I'd heard so much about it, though I'd never read critiques, so I didn't know the specifics. I just knew it was famous. And, well, I guess it was a good thing that I didn't know anything about its plot because it blew me away. For one thing, I never thought it was going to be this funny. Heller takes absurdity and ridicule to hilarious levels. This books manages to break your heart, lift your spirits, and keep you in stitches, sometimes all of the above within two or three consecutive pages.<br />The plot is haphazard but it keeps coming back to major points: a little detail that may seem absurd crops up later as a pivotal moment.<br />The serious side of it, on the other hand, left me thinking about the ridiculousness of war (yes, even WWII) and how certain aspects of it keep coming up every time men take up arms against their contemporaries. For example, the opportunistic, greedy characters with little or no scruples and the soldiers who end up being heroes even though their actions were inspired by nothing other than pure cowardice. Many people have come out against this book, calling it anti-war, but I think it opens up a different perspective and it makes you stop and think about how much mere accidents play into what the government tries to sell us as well-thought out strategies.<br />Heller raises absurdity to the level of art. I highly recommend this book if you want to laugh out loud and be moved.
0515141429|5.0|After choosing a Jack Reacher book off the racks a few months back, my husband and I have become avid fans. Lee Childs knows the formula to writing a novel that you just can't put down. And his character, Jack Reacher, is the kind of guy you just keep cheering on and you just know he's going to crush the bad guys. Although we've read some of the books out of order, it hasn't hurt the story lines. But I now carry a list of all the Reacher books listed in published sequence and as time permits I will order the remainder Reacher books in order from Amazon. If you like lots of action and enjoy seeing the little guys come out on top, then this series is for you.
0375831002|5.0|I admit that when I started this book I was put off. I didn't get the whole death narrative and am sad to admit that I put it down a few pages in and only picked it up once I had run out of other books. Having just now finished this book I am so sad I didn't go farther the first time! I am a bit of a wwii buff so I have read countless stories about the Holocaust and Nazi Germany. But the narrative is beautiful in this story! The sketches and stories shared by Liesle and Max... Deaths take on the whole situation, the poetic prose of it all... it came together beautifully. I am a bit surprised that this is recommended to young readers. While I feel it is important I also feel that they might miss some of the deeper themes. All in all I am in love with this book. I think I will check out more by this author.

B005COO1X6|2.0|I was disappointed with this particular story.  I have been reading Stephen King books since I was a kid and I like most of them.

I would not recommend this story, even for a couple of bucks.
1451648537|5.0|When someone like Jobs dies the temptation is to lionize. \\"Don't speak ill of the dead.\\". To be sure there has been breathless coverage over the past month (with some discussion of Jobs personal and professional failings).   One wonders: \\"Was he really that amazing?  Edison? Ford?\\"  Isaacons biography answers these questions and more.   In Isaacon's Einstein biography he wrote wonderfully about Einstein's five papers in 1905 that revolutionized physics. More importantly he put that achievement in perspective so that a non-scientist could understand that what Einstein did was almost unparalleled. Isaacon's biography of Jobs puts Jobs's achievements in perspective and leaves little doubt that his business achievements were among the most extraordinary ever.   Isaacon concludes that Jobs was not exceptionally smart in the way of Einstein or Edison.  Wozniak was the engineering genius).   Yet Isaacon's says that Jobs was a genius. But at what?  That is the real question that Isaacon confronts and endeavors to answer.   Apple was obviously not the first company in the tech field. By the time Apple was founded the business structure of Silicon Valley enterprises that rewarded merit and eschewed hierarchy was already well established. It was Xerox that pioneered the graphic interface.  Apple did not invent MP3 players or portable music players. Etc.  Xerox had a huge head start on the graphic interface yet it was Apple that made the Macintosh. Sony controlled the market in portable music (Walkman) made wonderful electronic products AND had a music division. Yet Apple's iPod and iTunes revolutionized the music industry. Apple did so because of Jobs. He was the difference.   Isaacon demonstrates that what Jobs did better than anyone else was to understand how technology could be configured to improve the lives of consumers and to drive his company relentlessly and ruthlessly to make the best products possible.   Jobs's wife told Isaacon to tell the full story of Jobs, and Jobs knew that there would be things in the book that he would not like and there are plenty of unsavory moments. Jobs's personal life was messy and he was unwarrantedly cruel to many employees. That's all in the book.   Isaacon interviewed dozens of people for the book including Gates, Ellison and all of the key players. The book is highly readable (I finished it in a couple of nights).   You will not finish the book with any great lesson about how to be a better business person (and definitely not a better human being). Jobs was sui generis.  But you will understand one of the great business leaders of modern time.

B0058WFO06|5.0|The past few releases from Wilson's main band, Porcupine Tree, have not excited me as much as some of the earlier outings. His first CD released under his own name was similarly lacking in vim. This is not to say that those CDs aren't great. They're just not as exciting as I've come to expect from Wilson.  This second \\"solo\\" release is a return to greatness. Definitely worth a listen.

B0054VVRBQ|5.0|I have the late 2008 15' MacBook Pro that is lacking a SD card slot.  I was using the usb connection from my camera to retrieve my videos and pictures.  This process was too slow and was useless if I didn't have the usb cord with me.  That's when I found this nifty Card Reader.  I wasn't sure if it was going to stick out beyond the edge of my laptop.  I was pleasantly surprised when it didn't stick out.  The speed at which I retrieve my videos and pictures has increased noticeably.  My only regret is that I didn't find this product sooner.

B005EHNMWM|5.0|Wilco is a band that is at times overhyped by music critics & fans alike. They are not perfect, but they are doing the best they can.<br />I can feel the struggle within the music. I can feel the tension, the heartache & the honesty entwined. Sewn in the roots of the band<br />and woven through the soul that is \\"The Whole Love\\"...I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm in love with this album. I think it IS<br />almost perfect. Definitely a second favorite, right next to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Lyrically, it speaks in a poetic way & demands attention.<br />I have to say that being disappointed w/ the last album, I had no high expectations for this one. What a pleasant surprise! I truly feel<br />as though they have done something profound by releasing this album into the world. I'm especially happy to hear the experimentation<br />that plays an important role on this record. For me, that's one of the key things that makes Wilco great! It's all about HOW they use<br />those sounds, finding purpose & truth in the noise. I tend to admire bands that aren't afraid to explore & find something interesting<br />in the process of songwriting. Let's face it: Songwriting is a process and Wilco has mastered the ART of breaking songs down,<br />reassembling them, deconstructing and fitting the pieces where they see fit...and this albums fits like a glove. It's wonderful & I'm<br />thankful for it.
0545265355|5.0|Amazing, amazing books! I Had them shipped internationally and the package arrived in perfect conditions, and right on time.   These are one of the best fictions books I've read recently and definitely worth the purchase; once I picked the first one up I couldn't  Stop turning the pages until the very end.
0451228375|3.0|A good book to pass the time on vacations and bus trips. Many of the characters appear similar to the Pillars of the Earth not only because many of the characters are descendants from the characters of the previous book, but also because they seem to fill the same slots of personality types  such as the psychopathic Earl, the plucky landless peasants, the inventive entrepreneur middle-class merchants, the conservatives vs. the inventive, as well as the sexually oppressed women vs. the powerful, obsessed men. Still, a well researched book about life in the Middle Ages with thriller aspects which will tempt you to read past where you intended to stop.
1594202842|5.0|I found the book to be both cleaver and brutally honest. Amy Chua is hard working and determined and above all she is successful. She and her children will go far. I would love to hear from the children in about 10 years from now, especially to see how they're raising their own children if they can first find a husband worthy of their mother's approval (ha ha).  Seriously, I have read this book twice and even taken a few tips of hers and applied them with my own children.
630170648X|4.0|Obviously the title is from \\"Hamlet\\" It refers to a Polish theater company in Warsaw just prior to and during the 1939 German invasion. Benny plays an insecure ham actor married to Lombard. She appears to be entertaining herself with Robert Stack, a dashing Air Force officer. When the germans invade, the company has to masquerade as Nazis in order to foil a spy plot. Benny is typically himself and is well supported by the rest of the cast. Lombard is beautiful and funny. I have seen this movie many times, and wanted to have it in my collection.
B005OIAFQC|5.0|I am too old to dissect music as one of the haters in the review below. All I know is that I listen to a plethora of music from all genres and by virtue of massive exposure have developed, what I believe, to be a pretty well rounded taste. As a kid, I loved my gothic industrial bands because I could relate to the existential angst that was the center of their lyrics. Nowadays, ready to turn 30, having lived a little, I cannot listen to most of the industrial, black metal, thrash stuff of my youth unless it really stands out musically to be warranted attention regardless of the musical genre you subscribe to.  This VnV Nation record is just that. It is representative of the industrial/futurepop genre without being terribly corny. If you simply abandon the critic's ivory tower and take this record within confines of the genre, it is an absolutely marvelous and entertaining record. I dabble in DJing and started injecting some of the tracks into the otherwise faceless array of house and trance tunes I sometimes spin. Party people love it. So enjoy and stop hating. This is AMAZING dance music in the time of characterless, corporate produced dance tracks on your local top 40 station and in your generic yuppie dance club.

1461190460|3.0|After 200 millions copies have been sold and having over 190 translations I was recommended this book by a home-schooling organization. It must be really good right? Written for kids? Straight forward? Amusing? One would think, right? After 432 five star reviews there must really be something to this book. Unfortunately my six year old and I were not crazy about it. The plot is simple: we have a man whose plane goes down in a desert in Africa. A young boy called the little prince approaches him, makes friends and proceeds to tell him about his planet and the journey he takes from one planet to the next before he reaches earth. Each planet is different and minor lessons are learned on each one. Overall I think the story was weak and the lessons unclear for a small child and actually meant for adults. Some think it's a Christian allegory but I'd have to say it's not. It felt like it never really had its feet on the ground. I can't say I recommend the book but on the other hand it's very short so you won't lose too much time reading it.

B005KJZDXK|5.0|Lovely album.  Great addition to my ever expanding Christmas music collection.  Simple arrangements with little accompaniment, which is refreshing.  Liked the she/him switcheroo on Baby It's Cold Outside.  Hadn't heard that before.  And did I mention the adorable packaging with the card inside?  Looks very 60's, which is the idea, of course.  Nice.  Very nice.  Can't wait for after dinner on Thanksgiving, which is when the Christmas music begins its constant rotation around here.
0375826726|4.0|I have to say, I was a bit disappointed that the series did not end here, and only then to find out the last book would come out 2 years later from when I finished Brisingr. I do believe that the ra'zaac were killed way too easily. Especially when they were feared for their abilities. (That they did not really show during the fight) On the other hand, the rest of the book was pretty good. But do not let all of this negativity about the Inheritance series get to you. If I could have a do-over, I would read this book again and again.
B005MYEPXC|4.0|I expected this movie to be a disappointment not being an Owen Wilson fan, but was pleasantly surprised. The storyline and the notable cast do an excellent job to explore the themes. Not to mention it shows you Paris the only way it should be seen - on foot and with long, meandering walks..You'll be pleasantly surprised with this one!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|When I ordered this I was a bit worried that it might not reach up to my expectations. I had heard about this version before and everyone had said that it was good. As soon as I got it, I plopped down onto the couch with some popcorn and ended up watching it two times in a row! It was such a good movie and the actors played their parts well. This is now one of my all time favorite movies, and I cannot wait to get my second copy for my friend.
B002Q9MZF6|2.0|This is definitely not a production for traditionalists.   Rodolfo and Mimi have sex after finding her key, before joining the others at the Café Momus.  From the beginning Mimi is dressed like a harlot -- in red, with plunging décolleté, large exposed breasts, and bright red lipstick.  The set colors in general are loud and bright, the sets are incongruous, and the  cinematography is grossly oversaturated in an almost cartoonish fashion.  It might fly with the iPhone generation and the sex-obsessed, but I'd bet Puccini is turning over in his grave.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|After reading the books the movie was a bit of a letdown. Most of the stuff that happened in the movie did not even happen in the book, or happened in the 2nd. NOT the first. 2nd of all, they used older characters. Instead of Percy Jackson being portrayed as 12-13, he was 16. The age where he is supposed to end up dying or living according to one of the prophecies. So now, they are either going to have to start from scratch and come out with another first movie, or they will just have to improvise. (They will most likely choose the second) Also, Annabeth's eyes were GREY. And I think Percy's were green... Not that that matters, but when your basing a movie off of a book, it is probably best to go by the book.<br />Although, if you have not read the books then you would like this movie. Percy Jackson & The Olympians was a good movie by itself, but basing it off of the book, it was a rip-off.
B005TOW9JM|4.0|It's been four years since the French electronic duo Justice delivered their masterpiece, Cross, and today they're back with their highly anticipated follow-up, Audio, Video, Disco. The lead single from the album, \\"Civilization\\" was classic Justice, with a pounding beat and a theatrical epicness that one would expect from Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay. Since \\"Civilization\\" debuted, though, snippets of other songs have leaked to mixed reactions. Now, with today's release of the full album, I'll go track by track to see just how Audio, Video, Disco stacks up to Justice's other work.  1. \\"Horsepower\\": It starts out nice, with a growling guitar much like that on \\"Civilization\\", the song it proceeds. Along with some brighter synth portions as well as some darker strings, it's a good way to kick off the album. The song's good, but it acts as a prelude to Civilization and doesn't stand out on its own quite enough.  2. \\"Civilization\\": You've all heard this one before, but it bears repeating that \\"Civilization\\" is just a damn good anthem. The guitars erupt and scream on the track, and the whole thing has a brilliant grinding tension in the first minute of the song that ends up in an electronic explosion, with a heavy beat kicking in and sending this song into outer space. This one's better than a good number of songs on Cross, and will definitely be spinning at clubs for years to come.  3. \\"Ohio\\": ...the can't be all great, though, right? It's really the lyrics that mess up the song. Repeating \\"Ohio, Tennessee, California, Endlessly...right on\\" over and over again, just what are they trying to say? I know electronic music isn't exactly known for having lyrical depth, but the lyrics just feel so disjointed from the song underneath. And that's a shame, because the instrumental part of the song is quite nice, something that you can enjoy in the (mostly) lyricless last minute of the song.  4. \\"Canon - Primo\\": Just a little harpsichord-ish intro to the proper \\"Canon\\"  5. \\"Canon\\": This one reminds me a little bit of Daft Punk's \\"Robot Rock\\" with its heavy guitar riff (something that seems to be a trend on this album). The song has a real drive to it, with synths, guitars and thunderous drums fighting for sonic space throughout the track.  6. \\"On'n'On\\": The singing on the track sounds like some long lost vocal from a forgotten 70s vocalist, combined with a strings happy Justice dropping something a lot more melodic than the previous tracks behind it. It works really well, and is probably one of the most newcomer-friendly tracks Justice has done so far. It also ends with a huge outro that glides seamlessly into the next track...  7. \\"Brianvision\\": Not a whole lot going on in this track. It's not that it's bad or anything, but it's also not good. Seeing that \\"Canon\\" and \\"On'n'On\\" really delivered the goods previously, this song can be forgiven for being a bit of a lull.  8. \\"Parade\\": I'm really getting a Queen vibe from this album as I get deeper into it. Aping the stomps and hand-claps from \\"We Will Rock You\\" as they do on this track, I'm guessing it was intentional. The song also includes some welcome weirdness, with the audio inexplicably dropping out for a couple of seconds right before the end and a glitchy, staccato intro, but the middle feels a little limp, like it's trying to get by on the Queen vibe they set the song up with.  9. \\"New Lands\\": This one starts off sort of uninteresting, without a whole lot going on at first other than a falsetto vocal on top of what sounds like an alternate take of \\"Civilization\\", but at around the 2:30 mark, the song shifts gears and starts accelerating on its own and really working by the time it's done.  10. \\"Helix\\": The chopped up vocal snippets on this are nice, giving the song a vocal punch without dominating the song. But the guitar that does dominate the song sort of sounds like a variation on the same riff that has been pervading the rest of the songs. The riff itself is good enough on itsown, but I feel like Justice is leaning on it way too hard, especially at this point, ten tracks in. Even though the song does another gear change toward the end, it just doesn't deliver   11. \\"Audio, Video, Disco\\": The harpsichord from \\"Canon-Primo\\" returns here on the final track to lead us into a chaotic, heady, bass drum heavy send-off in the final track on the album. All that chaos burns off by the end of the song, but I'm not sure if it's the best way to go. I would have liked for Audio, Video, Disco to spend its last few minutes really blowing the windows off, but it doesn't. It instead chooses to ease into something quieter and quieter until it's just done. Maybe if there had been some more real bangers on this album it would have been a welcome come down, but as it stands, it's more disappointing than relaxing.  So, there we go, all eleven tracks laid out on the examination table. The only songs that I had a major aversion to were \\"Ohio\\" and \\"Brianvision\\", just because they seemed so lazy and uninspired. The other songs, even though most of them had parts that didn't deliver, at least had some portion that redeemed them enough to warrant a second listen.  As for my impressions of the album as a whole, I think it marks a change in Justice's overall feel, and it might have been designed to deliver a hard kick against the people who expected them to deliver another Cross. It's not Cross, far from it, and right now I don't think it's as good as Cross, but it does stand on its own as a strong album that has the potential to grow as you listen to it more. I think a lot of Cross fans won't be happy with Audio, Video, Disco, but I think as the years wear on, and Justice hopefully takes less than four year between each release, this could fit in well as we watch Justice evolve from house DJs with massive beats to maybe something more refined and subtle.  The album is for the most part a three star work, but there are moments here, of great brilliance, that add the extra star for me. A lot of people will be disappointed that they're not just re-hashing Cross, but I'm happy they're not

B000QFW7UA|5.0|This just came in the mail. I was expecting to have merely a wonderful blu-ray disc. There's so much more included. A removable slip around the box depicts the board game, reproductions of magazines, and a storyboard card set (all included). Vivid photos throughout all the packaging, along with informative material in one of the magazines about what the stars have been involved with since the movie. The earlier dvd has a unique visual commentary option while you watch the movie. Often, the camera will show a picture within picture of the stars watching along with you... and I do mean watching along with you.  There's a sense of fun while they reminisce with each other.  That's a rare feature, basically the only time I've seen something like that.
031603438X|2.0|This is actually pretty close to Lemmy Kilmister's bio - great beginning up to the middle, most likely the parts that are more closely written with the artist and then a quick finito by the ghost writer...\\"eh, you finish it any way you like it\\" type of deal.  The early childhood up to rise in stardom of the Stones is well documented, with quite a few anecdotes and interesting stories. Keith talks about his family and the really interesting relationship with his dad but towards the middle up to the end of the book the stories can be summarized (pick at random):  1) nailed such and such model/starlet/other band member's spouse/girl  2) had a row/divorced such and such model/starlet/other band member's spouse/girl  3) did drugs  4) tried to quit drugs  I wish there was more beef about the music or at least an even balance of it.

B00072POFW|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is used symbolically at two times in the book. The first time we find out \\"it is a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" This is part of the culture that existed in this small, depression era southern town.  Many people lived by truisms, many of which were not good.  The second time it is used, it is too close to the end to mention.<br /><br />Atticus, the town lawyer,  is understanding  to the truisms, but lives by his own code, one that is far more honorable than we can imagine.  The story is told in first person by Scout, the daughter of Atticus.  Like the popular movie, \\"Christmas Story\\" the narration, although done by a child, it is not child-like.<br />We grow up together with Scout and her older brother Jem over a period of three years.  We get to know their neighbors. While the characters are memorable,  they are nowhere near the quirky level of modern day characters.  Except, for Atticus, the characters are very realistic. Atticus is exceeding patient  and understanding. At one point he tells his children it is wrong to \\"hate Hitler.\\" He accepts people as they are with all their faults, even those who threaten him.  Gandhi could have taken lessons from him.<br /><br />While the book centers around Scout and Jem, it runs with a semi-subplot as two life events occupy their young lives.  The first is their fascination with a shut-in neighbor, Boo Radley.  They take to wild speculation about him and have a desire just to see the legendary man. The second event is the trial of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of rape by a white woman. Atticus defends him to the dismay and even hatred of many of the town folks.<br /><br />Race relations is part of the story. Much of the hard hitting aspects of the injustices are overshadowed by the rest of the story. There is frequent \\"N\\" word use that is both derogatory and non- derogatory , as it was in that era.<br /><br />The book has its message as it compares Hitler to America, when it states: \\"Over here we don't believe in persecuting anybody. Persecution comes from people who are prejudice.\\" While clearly the book has a race relations theme, I couldn't help by think about the current class warfare being waged when I hear Scout define democracy in her father's words: \\"Equal rights for all. Special privileges for none.\\"<br /><br />In some ways it was a prequel to \\"The Help,\\" but not hardly the tear-jerker. An easy read.on't believe in persecuting anybody.

B005CM9DX6|3.0|There's a lot of really cool stuff on this album, like \\"Folklore\\" \\"I Feel the Dark\\" and especially \\"Marrow of the Earth\\", but this album is really lacking what makes Opeth Opeth. That finally became apparent for me after going to the Warfield a week ago and seeing them perform. I already have listened to the whole album probably 6 times, but the concert solidified it. My favorite band has lost it. The songs off of Heritage just seem like they are a very simple reduction of what makes Opeth great, especially in comparison to the other great acoustic songs that they played: like \\"patterns in the ivy 2\\" \\"dirge for november\\" \\"closure\\". Those songs are heavy, though not in presentation but thematically and musically, complex and powerful. The songs off of Heritage are heavy in presentation only, and not very complex and definitely not powerful. However, there are some gems on this album, like the ones i mentioned.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|I have read some of the negative reviews of this movie and for the most part it's from people with the same complaints I have heard about other hero movies. Not enough action, characters not developed, not true to the comic, badly cast, and so on. I swear some of them just copy and paste their comments into any movie and then edit the title to match the film. By the time the review is over they have come off as either the ultimate comic book aficionado or William F. Buckly doing movie reviews.  You cannot expect a comic book to magically come to life exactly as the written in said book. With the history, horrific amount of retcons, and multitude of different books/interpretations by different authors it simply is not possible. Movie goers need to return to the roots of movie theater entertainment: having fun. Captain America was a FUN movie. It was entertaining.  For the average movie goer who doesn't know about Cap or his history, you'll have a pretty good time. Regardless of other reviews there is plenty of action and just enough background to get you on your way into the adventures of Steve Rogers without boring you with an overly hashed/retconned origin. It's a comic book movie, it's over the top hero fantasy with Red White and Blue patriotism. Not a bad thing.  For the people who have a some knowledge of the character and have read some of the newer comics and enjoy comic book heroes there should be enough here for you to comfortably recognize Cap and many of the supporting characters enough to give the hero a good tie in to be an Avenger next year in the Universe that has been created and provided for us by the various directors and actors who have brought it to life on the big screen.  If you are a hardcore comic book fan and the mere idea of your childhood heroes being rewritten and put on the big-screen is enough to make you flame every website and semi-positive review then please don't bother seeing the movie. You do yourself a disservice as well as to anyone else who managed to enjoy themselves for 2 hours who do not need your irate banter telling them how stupid they are and how everyone sucks.  If you are a Cap fan (like me) go into the movie knowing that this is yet another rendition out of the many we have already seen in our lives and the best one so far with the added attraction of the Avengers movie next year. I've seen Captain America wearing a motorcycle helmet in a made for TV movie that had next to nothing to do with his origin, the newer movie most others have seen with Ronnie Cox as the President, and even the old black and white serial where Captain America was a lawyer wielding a .38 revolver. Countless comic books, reboots to the series, alternate this that and the other, I'm just glad to see Captain America hit the modern movie scene with some good special effects and star power. There are also plenty of homages in the movie to the old comics if you look for them, my favorite being the most obvious of Dr. Zola's face being captured in that large round lens as a shout out to the fans of that ridiculous floating head in a hover chair.  Go into this movie looking to be entertained and have some fun. If you go into it to dissect it (even after claiming you were \\"giving it a chance\\") you will pretty much waste any money you ever spend watching a super hero movie, good or bad.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I love Michale Buble for his old soul charm and talent!  I've seen him several times in concert and love his music, personality and generosity towards his band and audience!  This Christmas cd is nothing short of what you would expect from him.  Great voice crooner voice! He's done the classics with the application of his fun, creative flair.  I highly recommend!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|This is a very good film, I enjoyed it very much. It presents a number of historical figures (Picasso, Salvador Dali, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald) in an amusing way and tries to give a feel for Paris in another era. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Also, Owen Wilson is a much better stand-in for Woody Allen than Kenneth Branagh, for example.    That said I personally didn't feel this film was as original as many of Woody's previous works: it seems to me only an average effort. If it received so much acclaim, it seems to me to partly reflect the fact that the usual Hollywood fare, particularly in summer, is ever so much meaningless garbage.  I guess the film just felt at times too \\"easy\\". Allen's unsympathetic characterisation of Gil's fiancé and her wealthy friends and family in particular seems too full of easy cliches. Which doesn't mean I didn't laugh at the way they are presented, only that it seemed too \\"easy\\" to present them as cardboard cut-out people who are rich, arrogant, entitled and out-of-touch. Similarly, the historical characters were surely an \\"easy\\" source of material and perhaps some of their lines are actual historical quotes. Just to say that it seemed to me to be an \\"easy\\" film which was not nearly as original or subtle as many of Allen's previous efforts.  Which doesn't change the fact that it was a very good film, one I would recommend, and one which was head-and-shoulders above most of the other films I've seen in the past year.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Where Iron Man 1 & 2 left you expecting more and the Fantastic 4 movies lacked the genuine feel of humanity and feeling overall complete this movie gets it right! the HULK '03 was way too bright and fake looking, Captain America seems more realistic with big explosions every so often.<br /><br />I recently bought The Green Lantern and it was visually good, great graphics but it had no depth it seemed cheap but maybe I'm biased towards Marvel over DC.<br /><br />I haven't gotten Thor yet skeptical of the story telling side of it more than anything. If you ignore the flaws in this movie ie. weapons issues functioning and ammo count etc and time period incorrect tires and phones the movie is wonderfully complete. It has more of the honest American working class heroe feel that will make it a classic in years to come. These characters (superheroes) make a outstanding genre that transfer well from print to screen.<br /><br />You really need to give thanks to the man Stan Lee. Honestly I can't wait to see The Avengers. Should be good if it follows this pattern each movie gets better and better.<br /><br />The only dissappointment is The Red Skull..... well lack there of. I wish it had more of the pure evil that made the NAZI's genuinely hated world wide with this character and tap into Weavings potential.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|Green lantern does not come with ultraviolet copy must b special edition.  I you see description details shows only 1 dvd, some moron change the description.  UPC matches for green lantern single DVD.  So when you buy Green lanter you will received i dvd no with ultraviolet copy.
B005CWRB44|4.0|Just a great little flashlight.  Very powerful and well made. I thought it came with a battery because it mentions a battery type on the front of the packaging. Why mention the battery as main feature with a bullet point if it does not 'come with' the flashlight?  It could have just as easily said it uses one battery but instead goes into details about battery model number, size, etc.  My opinion is that it is deceptive to list the item on the front of the packaging and not include it.  Take a look at packaging yourself. No where does it mention in the ad or on the packaging that it does NOT come with a battery. Other than paying $31 for the little flashlight plus additional $8 for a battery (not a cheap battery), it works great.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The one puzzling question I have about Steve Jobs, whose product, the Apple II, I first read about in a hobbyist computer magazine in 1978 is as follows:  Jobs was quoted as saying, during the introduction of the Lisa computer (and this is noted again in the book): \\"Picasso had a saying - 'good artists copy, great artists steal' - and we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas\\"  Yet, Jobs is quoted in the book as saying he was \\"willing to go thermonuclear war\\" on Google Inc.'s Android software, saying that its features amounted to \\"grand theft,\\" and that he would \\"spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,\\". He also said that if Google gave him $5 Billion to settle the lawsuit he would not accept it.  So, he admits he steals ideas but has this reaction when others do the same? Explain that one to me!  Also, the book has a few mistakes in it. The author uses principals instead of principles at one point and at another point he refers to the present as being thirty-five years after the mid-eighties.   Btw, I too bought the Amazon Kindle version of this book to read on my Dell laptop and on my iPhone as, ironically, I can't do that with an Apple iBook (as you can only read an iBook on an iOS device). Also, the only other biography that I feel was as well written, interesting and insightful about the subject was 'Snowball' the offical biography of Warren Buffett.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Coldplay's newest album, Mylo Xyloto, has some tracks with a more pop feel to them and some with repetitive choruses.  If you don't like anything too pop sounding, or if you are easily irritated by repetitive choruses, you may not like this album.<br /><br />Coldplay combines their new sound with elements of their old sound that we all know and love about Coldplay.  This album has beautiful layered melodies with synthesizers, keyboards, organs, pianos, strings and guitars.  The vocals at times have a layered sound as well.<br /><br />The title track is a short instrumental intro that leads into the first full song, Hurts Like Heaven.  It's a up-tempo song that you might be able to dance to (a first on a Coldplay album)!<br /><br />Next is the second single Paradise. I won't say much about it, except that you might catch yourself singing along after a few listens!<br /><br />The fourth track, Charlie Brown, starts slow, but then picks up the tempo, and it ends with a nice piano solo.<br /><br />Us Against the World is a slower acoustic song with some layered church organs toward the end of the song.<br /><br />Next is M.M.I.X., a short transitional instrumental interlude, which follows nicely into the first single, Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.  We've all heard this song for a while now, so there really isn't much else I can say about it.  The next track should be familiar to anyone who bought the Every Teardrop is a Waterfall EP - it's Major Minus!<br /><br />The tempo of the album slows down again with the next song, U.F.O.<br /><br />Princess of China is the next song, which, I'll admit I wasn't sure about when I heard Rihanna was going to be singing on this song.  If you listen to the lyrics, it makes sense - \\"I could be princess/you could be a king\\" sounds better with a female singer - it just wouldn't seem right if Chris sang those lyrics.  While I'm not a Rihanna fan, I think she sings the song nicely and her voice blends nicely with his (although there are times her voice just overpowers his).  The lyrics do get repetitive very quickly and it could be annoying to some people after a while.<br /><br />Up in Flames is another up tempo song with a repetitive chorus, so it might have the same problem as the previous track.<br /><br />The final three tracks start off with A Hopeful Transmission, the second transitional instrumental interlude, which flows nicely into Don't let it Break your Heart.  This song is the fastest tempo song that I have ever heard on a Coldplay album.  Finally the album closes with a slow acoustic song, Up With the Birds. I like that the band chose a slow song to end the album.

B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Before I saw this film in the theater this summer, I didn't consider myself to be that much of a Captain America fan. In fact, I didn't know much about Captain America at all, outside of the fact that he was in the Avengers and had a long and storied history with Tony Stark.  But then I watched this film and decided that, hey, maybe this is a character I want to know about.  If you're looking at buying/renting this movie, you probably know the basic story behind the character. But in case you don't: Steve Rogers, 90 pound weakling, wants nothing more than to fight for his country in World War II. He is rejected at every turn, before finally being selected to be injected with the experimental Super Soldier serum.   This is a very good adaptation of the origin story presented in the comics, and fits nicely into the puzzle that Marvel has been building, leading up to the Avengers. This is one of my favorite of the Marvel adaptations so far, and I can't wait to see where they take the Cap story next.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was super excited when I found out that this was Amazon's FAOTD.  I've used OfficeSuite Pro 4 on my Xoom and was pretty happy with it.  This newer version (also installed on my Xoom now thanks to Amazon) has upgraded the interface to make it more similar to what you'd find on a PC version of Microsoft Office.  It's very clean and easy to use.  I've had no issues viewing or editing any of my Word, Excel, or Powerpoint files thus far.  Highly recommend!

1451648537|5.0|This is not a puff-piece about Jobs. It paints him as the demanding pr*ck he was.  Yet this is a great history about the beginning of personal computers, and about the life of a CEO who valued perfection, innovation,beauty, functionality, and style.  Jobs changed the world; from computers, to music, to movies, to animation, to desktop publishing... Truly inspiring.
0307887898|5.0|I wish I'd read this book as soon as I received it.  Actually, I wish I'd read it years ago.  It is a true eye opener.  My background is legal and engineering research.  That translates into something of a corporate mindset when looking at projects and deciding what to get involved in.  The benefit of that mindset is that the process for improving or monetizing an established product is pretty clear.  The problem with that mindset is that truly new stuff is very hard to evaluate.  Also, in big corporate culture, it often seemed best to give lip service to new stuff but not any real effort because internal politics would kill it anyway.  This book describes a completely different mindset and one that I think will be very useful.  It's all about getting that minimum viable product into customer's hands and really and truly treating it as a learning opportunity.  I've touched on this notion in the past but have always been uncomfortable with it.  The entire idea of delivering something incomplete and hardly tested was anathema.  Now I can see it as part of a process.  The danger inherent in this book is the bibliography.  I want to read everything referenced.  Must avoid analysis paralysis.
B0050I2PQE|5.0|Ironically, living in a small town in Wisconsin (I am 49), my first Purple album was a cut out of \\"Come Taste the Band\\", and I worked back from that.  I also haven't seen much of this footage at all, prior to this DVD.  So, while I was very familiar with the music, I wasn't with the particulars.  This package is an enlightening view into the changes of the band, and its ultimate demise.  The concert footage is the only Bolin era that is available, per Glenn Hughes.  The documentary is fascinating, in its candidness and also breadth of experience.  Be aware, the only two current contributors are Jon Lord and Glenn Hughes, so it is through their very honest eyes, but theirs only.  There may be some disagreement, especially the Indonesia incident, if you do research on your own.  It also ends up having a lot of Hughes' drug issues, and by association, Bolen's.  I did find it fascinating, and as my title says, sad.  A great band, in name, morphs into a different, but very skilled version (face it, Purple was never stagnant when it come to members).  Curious what could have happened, but it would have been different from MK II.  I enjoyed it very much; not everyone may.
0393317552|4.0|This book is fascinating content-wise, easy to read, but ultimately gets very repetitive.  Nevertheless, I learned a lot and will read definitely read \\"Collapse.\\"
0385344325|1.0|I am a long time Lee Child fan and have read all of his books.  This book, however makes me wonder if he is running out of new ideas.  the story line was just ok but if it had built to a Reacher type climax with an ending you could not predict, it could have been very good.  I thought, however, that the ending was very unsurprising, hard to believe and unnecessarily ruthless, even for Jack Reacher!    If this is the way our government really works we are all in serious trouble.    When one invests as much time as it takes to read a book such as this, one expects to think that the time was worthwhile and enjoyable.  Other than getting insights on how Reacher's military career ended I thought the book was pretty much a waste of time--mostly because of the uninspired ending!
B000UJ48U4|1.0|Let me start by saying, I'm a BIG Stanley Kubrick fan. I thought this movie was one of the worst I've ever seen in my entire life. Howard Stern roasted Tom Cruise about his promotion of this film (rightfully so)Cruise explained to an interviewer (not Stern) how only Stanley Kubrick was allowed on set to film the nude scenes because they were so erotic they had to be kept secret. Stern went on to say...\\"What the hell is the big deal about the film crew watching the scenes? You're going to be showing the movie to hundreds of thousands of people after it's released in the theaters!!!\\" That about sums it up. Stupidity, wooden acting, a repressive score, and putrid dialog. I was so upset that this was Kubrick's last film because it was, in my opinion, his worst.

B005KQVDH8|5.0|The blu-ray edition looks great! This is the first time I've actually purchased this movie even though I've seen it many times as a kid and think we even had it recorded once on VHS from a television airing back from the late 80's. The cast is awesome, the music is awesome and even everything outdated about it is awesome. There's really nothing I can compare with the Goonies awesomeness, because it has it's very own unique feeling and place in my heart. It will forever be a favorite.
B000002PB2|3.0|\\"Dawn Patrol\\" was Night Ranger's debut album, released in 1982 was a great rock record in the day, but for me it hasn't aged well.  This sounded good when I was 22, but now at 51, some of these songs don't click anymore.  The songs that still do it for me are:  \\"Don't Tell Me You Love Me\\" #40 hot 100 and #4 mainstream rock, still a smoking' hot number.  \\"Sing Me Away\\" #54 hot 100, \\"Eddie's coming Out Tonight\\" and \\"Night Ranger\\".  The rest of the disc has gone flat for me now.
0385534639|5.0|I read a little blurb about this book in my Entertainment Weekly and was instantly intrigued. So I got a coupon for 50% off at my B&N, I naturally raced in to pick up a copy. And let me tell you, this book is MAGICAL. I mean, really, really, magical. Even the physical book is a reflection of the wonderful story within, with its black cover with silver inscribing and black & white illustrations that echo La Cirque de Reves. (It's beautiful.... I recommend reading it in hardcover, but a Nook will do in a pinch).    First, a quick (really inadequate) synopsis: Two seemingly immortal magicians recruit young proteges to compete against each other after years of training (Celia and Marco).  The venue? An ever changing, ever moving circus. The rules? Only one - that you cannot interfere with the other's work. The stakes? Unknown to the competitors. The young man and woman who are forced to compete in this mysterious challenge build a mystical world that visitors lose themselves in for a night, some for a lifetime. But as the competition progresses, it becomes dangerous to both the artists and bystanders. And when competitors find a deeper love than either have ever known, the risk becomes even greater for all of those involved.    This is Morgenstern's debut, and it was hard to believe that it could possibly live up to the hype. I have heard mixed reviews... most people love it, some hate it. I can see why the book is divisive. Some people believe it starts off too slow, too descriptive, with too many plotlines. However, I am firmly in the camp of those who love it. Love, love, love it! I completely lost myself in the story. When I put the book down, I couldn't wait until the next time I could pick it up to return to La Cirque de Reves. I found myself becoming one of the \\"reveurs\\"... the characters in the book who come to love the circus so much, that they follow it from town to town, even from continent to continent. The author writes with such detailed prose that the reader can smell the caramel popcorn, and see the black and white stripes of the circus tents rising in the air. Beneath this enchanting world that she has created, is a subtle darkness, and a slow-building love story that propels the tale forward. Morgenstern artfully weaves together multiple storylines, and even timelines, that converge in the final few chapters of the book and bring the reader to a stunning conclusion. It may be difficult to follow the jumping around at times, but Morgenstern keeps each chapter fairly short and easy to follow.    Truthfully, I don't think my review will do this book justice. I have read a lot of books this year. Still, this is definitely one of my absolute favorites and probably one of the few that I will read again. There are so many subtleties and nuances that I think I will appreciate even more now that I see the \\"bigger picture\\". It is one of the more unique books that I have recently read, and the rights have already been sold to Summit Entertainment to turn it into a movie (surprise, surprise). So make sure you read it before it comes out on film in a couple years! This is a book for readers who use a lot of imagination, and if you do... you will find yourself lost in the world of The Night Circus.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty's \\"Full Moon Fever\\" (1989) #3, is still one heck of a record 22 years on.  Tom got Jeff Lynne (ELO/Move) to produce this great album.  For an album to have all these hits and album cuts, it never seems to get old.  \\"Free Fallin' \\" #7 hot 100 and #1 mainstream rock, is still one great tune.<br />As are these songs, \\"I Won't Back Down\\" #29 hot 100 and #1 mainstream rock, \\"\\"A Face In The Crowd\\" #46 hot 100 and #5 mainstream rock,  \\"Love Is A Long Road\\" #7 mainstream rock, \\"Runnin' Down A Dream\\" #23 hot 100 and #1 mainstream rock, The Byrds cover \\"Feel A Whole Lot Better\\" #18 mainstream rock, \\"Yer So Bad\\" #5 mainstream rock,  \\"The Apartment Song\\", \\"\\"Alright For Now\\", the jangly \\"A Mind With A Heart Of It's Own\\" (Should of been another hit), and the playful \\"Zombie Zoo\\".  Great stuff by Petty and Lynne.

0670022411|1.0|I almost never stop reading a book before the ending but I couldn't make it past page 200. I wish I had quit before that but I kept thinking that since it was a good premise, and I generally enjoy paranormal romances, I would try to stick it out until something interesting happened. It never did. Sorry, I'm not an eloquent writer either but all I can say is that this book is super boring and don't waste your time.
B000008GHW|5.0|And Hendrix's legacy lives on.<br /><br />As the first album to have been released after Hendrix's unfortunate death, it's no surprise that an album would be so satisfying to listen to, even if the artist has died. Hendrix, Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, Noel Redding, Juma Sultan, and Buddy Miles have made an astonishing achievement. These songs are, as usual, first-rate. Songs such as \\"Freedom,\\" \\"Ezy Rider,\\" \\"Night Bird Flying,\\" and \\"Straight Ahead\\" are typical of the Hendrix experience: hypnotic music and hard-hitting lyrics. \\"Astro Man\\" is pretty weak in some parts, but even this song doesn't prevent this album from being worthy of second place. The Cry of Love is a definite classic, and it's in the same level as Are You Experienced and Axis: Bold as Love.<br /><br />Grade: 9.8 out of 10<br /><br />Also from Jimi Hendrix<br />Are you Experienced (10 out of 10) [[ASIN:B0033AGPEO Are You Experienced CD/DVD]]<br />Axis: Bold as Love (9.9 out of 10) [[ASIN:B00328G4Y8 Axis Bold As Love CD/DVD]]<br />Electric Ladyland (9.7 out of 10) [[ASIN:B00328G4XY Electric Ladyland CD/DVD]]<br />Band of Gypsys (10 out of 10) [[ASIN:B000002UVX Band Of Gypsys]]

B005H9B2CE|3.0|This action movie does deliver on some levels that many blow them up style action movies today do not. For starters, it has a somewhat cohesive plot. The action scenes are generally able to be followed, and the majority of the graphics are on par with what is being put out today. On the other hand, the plot is not that particularly imaginative, there are scenes where the graphics are sub par, and the characters do not create much of any reason to care about them or their plight. In particular, the chemistry between Thor and Natalie Portmans character is terrible and their interest in each other leaves one wondering where their romance was established. Sure, he's a god. He's super ripped and powerful. But that's about all that I could find as an attraction for Natalie Portman. The dialogue is lacking and quite standard for a hollywood boilerplate script. These qualities are pervasive throughout this movie and it's characters. Though it is somewhat entertaining, this is not a terribly good movie.
B003S897U0|2.0|The advent of this collection of the Crowes \\"unplugged\\" was brought about by the band announcing that they were wrapping up this phase of the band and as a fan-appreciation effort, were offering a full scale \\"goodbye\\" tour and releasing this effort in support of the tour.   For the most part, this collection is a snoozefest and unfortunately, the stripped down performances really do nothing to spark enough interest by utilizing this updated version of the band. Its a novel idea, to take alot of classic Crowes numbers and give them the acoustic style treatment, but honestly, this phase of the band, I am not the biggest supporter of, and I find this lineup and era of the band to be bland and underwhelming. The country gospel flavor given to one of their mini-epics My Morning Song is a blatant rip-off of Leon Russell's Give Peace a Chance(which the band had covered earlier in '05/06 on the first reunion tours) and is tacky and contrived. They do throw in Cold Boy Smile which was one of the newer tracks written during the first phase reunion lineup and also throw in Gram Parsons' She that the band had covered for years,(first appearing at a show in San Francisco back in '94) and is a competent rendition. The acoustic version of Under a Mountain is nice, esp. with the back-up harmonies of Charity White and Mona Young, the band's travelling back-up singers. But overall, this retreading of their back catalogue is uninspired and simply redundant. Even Chris' voicings are a bit tiresome and thin, soundwise. Granted, he's alot older and not the wailer that he used to be from years past, but somehow, its just not possessing of passion and soul. And that goes for Croweology as a whole and the band as well. Very disappointing, they go out with a whimper... 2 stars

B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Clearly co-producer Steven Spielberg and writer/director J. J. Abrams wanted to paint a picture-perfect homage to the former's great classics of the 70's and 80's.  This movie succeeds without qualification.  Set in the late 70's in a small Ohio blue collar town, a youngster tries to overcome the accidental death of his mother.  Joe (Joel Courtney) has a rocky relationship with his father and police deputy played by the always good Kyle Chandler.  Joe and his friends are making a student film using a period icon, the super 8 camera.  During the filming late at night they witness the crash of a train that has not only an unusual cause but mysterious after effects.  The crash itself is a highlight, even though railroad cars shooting into the sky like missiles seems highly unlikely.  Still it is well done.  During the events, Joe also begins a flirtation with comely Alice played with unusual tenderness by Elle Fanning.  Make no mistake this girl can act.  Their budding romance is beautiful to watch and one that most of us adults wish we would have had when we were teeny boppers.  The \\"monster\\" in the story is kept from view most of the time ala \\"Jaws\\" but he eventually surfaces and wrecks carnage all over town.  The ending is a bit tidy, but there is no mistaking this well crafted near masterpiece and was the surprise of the summer.<br /><br />In a second viewing I saw the movie in IMAX. Is it worth the extra money?  No.  The film is obviously larger so we see more skin pores and blemishes, but it doesn't add much to the overall scale of the film.  While the film has an extraordinary train crash, and a violent alien creature, the movie is centered on the relationships between kids crashing puberty.  Joel Courtney as Joe and Elle Fanning as the slightly older Alice are terrific.  \\"Super 8\\" shows that a movie primarily about kids (making a home movie), doesn't have to be a \\"kid movie\\".  Let Jim Carrey and the Penguins cover that territory.<br /><br />2-11-12:  Blu ray update - The transfer has excellent clarity.  It is crisp and detailed.  Very little grain.  The Dolby TrueHD is spectacular.  The freight train crash will test your equipment.  The audio is reference quality.  The extras are all in HD which is nice.

B005H0IW6W|3.0|If interested, you can find a longer review at my pop culture web site : [...] (under the Miscellaneous Blog).  Here is an excerpt:  It's beginning to sound a lot like Christmas with the recent release of Michael Buble's holiday album titled \\"Christmas\\". I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the 21st century crooner complied fourteen tracks for the holiday season, and for the most part the album does not disappoint. After the success of Christmas tracks \\"Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!\\" and \\"My Grown Up Christmas List\\", it makes a lot of sense that Buble would want to cash in on the always booming Christmas Music machine. His new album mixes old time classics with some newer Christmas songs, plus a less known holiday song that may just be the best one on the album.    [...]
B004VF68AQ|5.0|A very dark melodic album with no weak songs, Navarro's guitar lays the lumber! Fear not Jane's fans this is not the band of the late 80's but at least you will find them in concert and gaining momentum! with or without Avery!<br />Inevitably what we are missing is the progression 6 albums, However its possible they may have pissed most fans by going in a new electronica direction, besides these guys still have mad skills, and solid foundation!
0062112430|3.0|Every girl grows up waiting until the moment when she falls in love for the first time. For some, it's the first time one lays eyes upon him from across the room. For others, it takes years to develop that sense of loyalty. Our dreams explode with the possibilities and our pillows are stained with our tears. Imagine waking up one day to never being capable of those feelings ever again. For some who have dealt with the grief of losing a loved one, that might be the ideal way to live out their lives. But for the rest of us who cling on to our heartstrings, that seems like a terrible loss of emotions.<br /><br />Lena has grown to accept that love is a disease that must be treated before it attacks. Schools taught that life with love is disastrous and cruel, no way for a reasonable adult to live. Take out love and you have a world of order where no one risks anything for such a feeling.<br /><br />It is an interesting idea that love can be cured and I was pleased with how well Oliver thought the deliria through in detail. So many authors have incredible ideas, and then throw the book to shambles when it is not thought out well enough to believe in the possibilities. The problem I had, was the repetitiveness of the explanations. It seemed to drown out the excitement of the storyline and I got lost...and bored...with the book. The beginning was fast-paced, the ending marvelous, the middle slow, slow, slow.<br /><br />I did like how well the \\"cured\\" characters were portrayed: harsh, unyielding to emotions, distant. I really did not want the cure after seeing the relationships between parent and child. It made me sick thinking that was the \\"normal way\\". I had a hard time reading it because I see it so often in my students' eyes. The desire for love from their families.<br /><br />In all, I would recommend this as a quick read. I don't know that I will read the other two books in the series.[[ASIN:0062112430 Delirium: The Special Edition]]

0385738773|5.0|We have followed closely on the running heels of the Gladers as they fought demonic beasts, survived in the harshest of terrains, and watch parts of their group die. We have survived with them, hearts beating at every turn of page and hoped against hope that they would make it beyond the grips of Wicked.<br /><br />Here we are again with Thomas and his band of misfits as they try to unveil the truth of their existence. As always, James Dashner has delivered an incredible novel to complete the series. I have yet to be disappointed in his ability to shine every character's personality and to keep us enthralled with them from page one to the final word. Though the conflict remains the same, the storyline is not repetitive. It's a new adventure for the groups with all new obstacles. Every question of mine was answered at some point, yet nothing was predictable. I think that is a talent that many authors do not have.<br />[[ASIN:0385738773 The Death Cure (Maze Runner Trilogy)]]<br />Each book has the ability to hold its own, but no one should deprive themselves of reading only one. Pick these books up from wherever you can find them and do not let go until the end of The Death Cure. They will keep your mind reeling for months!<br /><br />P.S. James is the first author whom I have seen that thanked book bloggers in his acknowledgements. That is just too cool! :D
B0015DYIH2|2.0|I am not a teenager, but do enjoy a good love story.  OK, the problem, this is not a love story.  This is, I am not sure what this is.  it was entertaining, but no more.  There is no great love, no well defined characters, no relationship development, nothing.  The writing is, well bad.  The minute details take 20 pages and details that should be part of the story are just gone with the wind (no comparison-not even close, BTW), a few sentences here and there. This book could have dropped several hundred pages and still got the point across.  I ended up skipping a lot, just to finish.  It was similar to driving past a car wreck, morbid curiosity about how it ends.   The first books in the series build up to the forbidden, (let's just say it) sex.  Kudos for waiting, I liked that part. But, now they are married and sex is Ok, legally, morally on all grounds right?  wrong.  This turns it into something painful, scary and to be avoided at all costs.  There was no honeymoon intimacy.  No morning after rush because they waited.  Oh, she gave us a few sentences then camera fade out...seriously?  We (and they) waited 3 books for fade out? But we do get the description in dozens of grueling pages of Leah and Jacob talking in each others' heads? of how the baby is killing her, how she is emotionally destroying Jacob.  But no sex, no intimacy, no description of how marriage is now a whole different level of being together. We get ten minutes of ya we had sex, then wham we are hit with the demon baby.  I liked Leah and Seth, but waaaay too much of it.  Leah needed a kick in the pants. Get over it my dear, you are a teenager for pity's sake, move on.  That would be the crux of the problem here, teens making the decisions forced on them way too early.  The adults are made to look as uninformed, untrustworthy or just ridiculous.   For classic love tales stick with Gone with the wind, West side story, a Tale of two cities, the Odyssey, etc...classics that have withstood the test oftime.  It is entertaining, but average at best. No great love, no bestseller quality writing or story telling here.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|After 2 initial straight forward pop/rock albums, a 3rd album that was her \\"artist\\" album and showed and edgier and darker Clarkson, and a 4th album that was a return to pop roots with some of the edge in tow, Clarkson has seemingly managed to merge both her and her label's vision of her music together, for both the right image and sound. Simply put, this album rocks, it's independent and fun at the same time. She is definitely more inclined to rock out than anything if given a chance, and she does it well, in fact very few ballads are on this album and where they are on they are excellent. It'd also be worth the while to get deluxe edition since in my opinion, 2 of the best songs are on it.  1. Mr. Know It All - one of the few mid-tempo songs on the album, it is one of my least favorite songs on here (a rarity fortunately). it's bland and boring and doesn't really have any build up or emotion to it. It's not horrible to listen to though, with good vocals and melody, it just...goes nowhere. so it's a fair 2/5.  2. What Doesn't Kill you (Stronger) - great anthem, can't wait for remixes of what's probably the most dance friendliest song on here- a bit of rock/dance. 5/5  3. Dark Side - It's rather mid-tempo with a slow burn but it does have a good pay off. 4/5  4. Honestly - A great, haunting power ballad. The best of the ballads on this album. 5/5  5. You Love Me - Back to rock, and some high notes to boot. It really harkens back to a classic rock sound of the 80's, but...for some reason I just don't like it as much as I really want to. 3.5/5  6. Einstein - Clever lyrics and not an altogether unlistenable song, but it's not great either. It's fairly midtempo but has a good buildup, a bit faster than Dark Side, but not as captivating. 2/5  7. Standing In Front Of You - Another ballad, but not as powerful as Honestly, yet not boring either. Classic Kelly sound but it seems like a regression and somewhat out of place on this album. 3/5  8. I Forgive You - This sounds sosimilar to Since U Been Gone musically (though not lyrically). Despite harkening back to an older sound, it works here better than on the last track. 4/5  9. Hello - This song is simply not getting the praise it should, from the reviews I've read. It's got a groovy rock sound, somewhere between mid-tempo and upper tempo. The chorus contains, hands down, the best hook on the standard album (sorry, Stronger..) 5/5  10. The War Is Over - Going back into ballad territory, this has a rising of emotion throughout the song, and I can hear that in her voice, but it just doesn't pull me in. It is really the standard editions only real misstep. 1/5  11. Let Me Down - Another grooving rock song, this amps up with some funk and R&B infused rock. I get what she's doing here, but it doesn't hav quiet the groove that Hello brings, and while it's got a great hook in the chorus, it's not quite as powerful. Though it's still a good listen. 4/5  12. You Can't Win - Another rock song, possibly the hardest rocking song on the album. Love the lyrics, really don't get pulled in by the actual performance of the song though. 2.5/5  13. Breaking Your Own Heart - A great mid-tempo ballad, it shows some growth in her ballad range, much like Honestly does, that Standing In Front Of You doesn't. 3.5/5  BONUS Tracks  14. Don't You Wanna Stay - Not a huge country fan,and we've heard this song before, but it's not a bad song. Not a Jason Aldean fan, but still, a good deluxe track. 3/5  15. Alone - Why why WHY is this song not on the standard edition? It is hands down the best song on the album, it's got the best hook of the entire collection (whereas Hello has the best of only the standard edition - see what I did there...) It is a very straight forward powerful rock song - it reminds me of something someone from the 80's would have sung but polished and refurbished with today's production. They need to release this as a single, but as it's a deluxe edition song I fear they won't. 5/5  16. Don't Be A Girl About It - Love the lyrics and the song is another rocker, can easily see Pink doing this song, in fact she could probably pull it off better than Clarkson, which is not to say that she does it badly, it could just be better. 3/5  17. The Sun Will Rise - A little country, a lot pop, a little rock. The second best song on the entire collection, it's definitely a builder - it starts out mid-tempo with it's violin intro and explodes with rock-ness at the end. Should also have been on the standard edition 5/5  So over all -  I guess it's a 4 star album. They could have probably cut out songs like Einstein, Standing In Front Of You, The War is Over and Don't Be A Girl About It, but it's still an overall excellent album. Except for The War Is Over, I can't really see myself skipping over any songs if I were to listen to the CD as a whole.
0446547654|2.0|I've read most of Nicholas Sparks's books, and get excited for a new book of his to come out. This one is about Dawson and Amanda who are teenagers when they fall in love, and are ultimately torn apart because he's from the wrong side of the tracks. They meet up years later when an old friend of theirs has died, and he requests that the two be there for his final send off. I'm not going to ruin the book for those who still want to read it. But be prepared for a lot of jumping around one page you are with Dawson, next Amanda, then Ted, Abee, a girl named Candy a few times, as well as Alan, Marilyn, Jared and Frank. You know that at some point that these characters are all bound to come together in some way to lead you to cry,... but you don't at least I didn't. Here is hoping his next book is better.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I have read several books by \\"Jesuits\\", and while reading \\"The Jesuit Guide to (Almost) Everything\\", by James Martin, SJ, he talked very favorably about this movie.  It - strikingly - demonstrates man's inhumanity to man, but it was a very well made movie. The acting was superb and the scenery was absolutely gorgeous.  As I watched the movie, I had to keep telling myself that this is 'just a movie'; it was so real.    I also wondered about the Indigenous actors; How did they do that? The number two disc of this this Two-Disc set tells how this was done, this is a second disc that you will not want to miss.  \\"The Mission\\" is also a testimony to St. Ignatius Loyola, who, when he started the 'Jesuits' told the Pope \\"Send us where no one else wants to go\\".  This is a fantastic movie!
B003K025TQ|5.0|This is phenomenal!!!  First, huge kudos to Lee for the whole concept and the guitar competition! What an idea!! What an undertaking!!!  Second, a big thank you to all the players who contributed to this project as well as those in the background responsible for all the details.  Everything about this CD is beyond words: the music, the musicians, the recording quality, the variety of styles, the virtuoso playing and.....and.....and....and....are you kidding me????  This would garner ten stars if allowed. Oh man........
B005S7GT32|5.0|New Blood, the special edition, makes a unique addition to my Peter Gabriel/Genesis CD collection. While I already have most of the songs, the orchestration on these versions is beyond beautifully done. The vocals, which in many cases are improved as far as diction is concerned, compliment the orchestra, as expected. I don't miss the percussion or guitars.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. There's hundreds of selections about zombies, but the unique \\"world perspective\\" gives you the opportunity to look at a potential zombie apocalypse from several different points of view. Great read from start to finish.
6305127697|5.0|Some films start off on a normal note but slowly enters a dark side, 'Primal fear' is one of them. There are several reasons for why this film is so attractive, one of the most primary reasons is the wonderful and impeccable cast performance. Richard Gere, Laura Linney and Edward Norton, the trio shine like never before. All those who assume this film to be a typical courtroom drama, you couldn't be more wrong, the film has a lot more to offer and overall, the film is a real delight to watch, from its starting to the concluding scenes. Worth a watch!

B004EPYZSK|5.0|This movie has it all. A really strong anti-hero, a heroic sheriff, a tragic lost love, the crazy trigger happy bully, the lawless cattle-baron, down-to-earth parson, a peace loving doctor/bartender(?), outlaws, Indians, really ugly aliens, a mystery woman and even a dog!  There is a love story, lots of action, interesting relationships and a bit of an echo of John Wayne's \\"Searchers\\". If you don't like Sci-Fi or westerns, forget it. If that is true, why would you go to movies at all? If you like strong characters, lots of action and an interesting story arc, by all means see it.
0812992792|5.0|Prepare yourself for a journey to a bizarre world where only one opinion matters--that of a psychotic despot who has convinced millions of people he is a living god.<br /><br />That world actually exists in the DPRK. What is especially remarkable about this novel is that Johnson provides the reader an opportunity to see it from the viewpoint of people who live there.<br /><br />Pak Jun Do is the son of a man who supervises a work camp for orphans. Though not an orphan himself, his father's position forces him to live life as one of those unfortunates. These children without parents, deprived even of their own names (they are renamed from a list of 114 martyrs of the regime), are subjected to toil and certain death in the lowest of jobs.<br /><br />When famine devastates the ranks of the orphanage, Pak becomes, successively, a tunnel soldier, a professional kidnapper, language student, radio operator on a fishing vessel, a hero who visits Texas on a government mission, and then a prisoner.<br /><br />In the second part of the novel, Pak reemerges from prison in the guise of Commander Ga, the feared rival of the Dear Leader and husband of the regime's legendary actress. In this section, we view Pak/Ga through the eyes of his interrogator who is both puzzled and fascinated by his subject.<br /><br />Some may view this novel as fantasy or allegory, and in some respects it is both. But those of us who have been to the DMZ and beyond know it is also a realistic portrait of that sad land. Some 40 years ago I was one of those who daily digested translations from the DPRK. The loudspeaker transcriptions and some other segments here gave me d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as I realized little has changed.<br /><br />Be sure to read the conversation between Johnson and Richard Powers.

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Within the first 70 pages I almost quit reading this. It was very graphic and truly made me ill. I knew that I wanted to find out how this amazing young lady was rescued, so I pressed on and thankfully it was less descriptive later on in the book. Overall, this was a good read, but getting past the beginning was the biggest hurdle to face.
0451219597|4.0|The story, true to history in many ways, brings alive the horror of war, the misery of loss of life, and the cruelty of people. It made me despise torture. Yet I found myself wanting to crush the enemy, wanting to make the Gestapo and the German officer, who was a serious threat to the mission of the Jackdaws (a group of untrained women spies led by Felicity Clairet, a British secret agent), suffer horribly.<br /><br />This is a book I can highly recommend as an exciting read, one that elevates the status of women--even if we don't like to hear about tough bitches who are as brave as men--and yet is balanced in its treatment of both sides of conflict, causing me to note how easy it is to get caught up in us-versus-them thinking--perhaps the root cause of so much evil we perpetrate against one another.<br /><br />Since my historical fiction novel,[[ASIN:B005I585ZE Unexpected Journey]], was recently published by a small press, I was also interested in studying the historical aspect of Jackdaws. It far surpassed my expectations in its factual accounts, its sense of story, and its depth of characterization. The people, British, German, and French, were complex, and made me wonder if the characters in my novel are nearly as real. I hope they are, and I hope my novel goes even a tenth the distance of raising consciousness and awareness the way Jackdaws does.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This was a very quick read for me....which says a lot with two children....I was constantly wondering what would happen next, and couldn't put it down. It breaks my heart and sickens me that these situations truly do happen to people and I can't even begin to imagine their agony. I would certainly recommend this book for Book Club groups as well.
B002CVQAX6|3.0|am reviewing the Blu-ray movie of Ghost Ship the movie start off good but half way through the movie it get's bad.it look's pretty good on Blu-ray it's has a good story line on it but it get's real slopy at the end of the movie is real dispointing.it got some pop up's on it but nothing scary.the characters on it is pretty good but the bad guy they chose at the end of the movie don't fit's on it to good.so it's a pretty good movie but the end of it is just horrible...
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I was not sure this would be a book that I would enjoy....but boy was I wrong! It was fabulous! It held my attention and moved along quickly. Even though the book is written in the form of letters, the character development was amazing and it was so much fun to read. Something a little different, that's for sure. This very quickly became one of my favorite novels and in my opinion is a Book Club \\"must\\"!
B002ZG9968|4.0|I have very mixed reactions to writing a review for this movie.  I did enjoy it despite its flaws.  Would I have watched/bought it without Alex O'Loughlin in it?  Definitely not.  It had some funny moments and some really awful ones (that birthing scene could have been funny, but it was a bit much - over-reacting or over-acting)??  Alex made a great, gorgeous leading man - he does THE best love scenes with those bedroom eyes OMG.  He also showed his flair for comedy and was a great foil for J-Lo's neurotic character - oozing charm and patience. His scenes with the Dad of three kids playing in the park were really hilarious.  J-Lo's leading men in these romantic comedies (like Ralph Fiennes in Maid in Manhattan) are always beautiful, charming and delightful actors - all of whom make her look good.  This is a wonderful, feel-good movie to watch repeatedly every now and then - mostly to have the absolute indulgence of watching Alex on the big screen.  I hope he gets more big-screen movie work in the very near future.
B000NY12LO|2.0|Sadly, I couldn't even begin to force myself to finish this book, or the first ten chapters for that matter. I am not sure if it just hits too close to home with the situation at hand or if I am just overall disappointed with the writing style and weak development. I was looking forward to reading this novel, but unfortunately it seems as though this one will return to the shelf virtually untouched.

I have not opened it yet and therefore could not show some of the inside pages.  So, for those of you looking for a detailed video review, I'm sorry I could not give such a review.  For those who don't watch the video, the book is aesthetically amazing (at least from the outside) and has a very solid, heavy feel to it.  I pre-ordered it on 10/23 and got it in the mail 10/25 (the release date) in perfect condition.  I absolutely have no regrets and maybe one day, I'll open it.  But for now, it's amazing just to look at the covers!   Thanks,  Kingkhan13

B005MW6IRU|2.0|Jumping the shark tank? This is what its called when someone does something out of character. For instance, this CD. Whats out of character? To make it simple listen to Remission, Leviathan, or Crack the Skye and then listen to the Hunter. See the difference? I know bands like to call this little move \\"growing as musicians\\" or \\"maturing\\". The people who are the REAL fans call it jumping the shark tank or selling out. Now this isnt a complete sell out but its pretty close. I understand that its apart of the buisness. Thats how the band makes money. But....werent Mastadon doing just fine without making this CD so weak? And while its not bad all around its not like the three CDs I mentioned at the beginning. This isnt a Load or ReLoad but I have to wonder just how far off a Load or Reload are for Mastadon? If I may quote the movie Wall Street where theres a part when a man tells Charlie Sheen \\"Money makes you do things you wouldnt normaly do\\". So when a band makes a CD chock full of radio friendly songs I have to wonder where there motivations are? But there is no turning back now. Once a band goes down the commercial road they can never go back. I know there are people out there who would buy a steaming pile from Mastadon if they told the masses it was gold. I however will not. Ive enjoyed Mastadon for years so the departure isnt a rough one. I knew it would come sooner or later. It always does. Even though I dont hate this CD I really cant condone it either. All I can say is \\"Buyer Beware\\".

B005LJK3AC|2.0|For a movie that had so many known actors it was a complete waste of time. The plot was completely unbelievable and I couldn't even convince myself that it was just a comedy movie and to try and enjoy it.
0385534639|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a well written story that you can lose yourself in.  It is enchanting and thought provoking.  The author does a marvelous job of bringing the scenes to life in a seemingly effortless way.  It is easy to picture yourself attending the magical night circus.  It is a historical/fantasy/romance, but doesn't overdo any of those aspects--as a result it was effortless to step into the world that  Morgenstern creates.  I finished this book in two days and loved it.
1442300051|5.0|I was somewhat disappointed when I received the Father's Day gift my wife gave me only to reluctantly load the CD's into my car CD player for a long road trip that same week. Two hours into my journey I stopped to call my wife to say.....\\"This is the best gift ever!\\"  OK, my review. Jesse Boggs, the reader, delivers Michael Lewis' \\"The Big Short\\" in a most fascinating and thoroughly entertaining manner. I am HOOKED on Michael Lewis books, and have read others, \\"Liars Poker\\", \\"Moneyball\\", \\"Boomerang\\" but I like \\"The Big Short\\" the best. Why? You get an inside look on the outrageous and insanity of the subprime mortgage crisis, credit default swaps, CD0's, etc. along with the added entertainment of several key characters and their particular insight and wherewithal to have enough guts to place their bets against an entire industry of mortgage bonds. Never thought this subject matter could possibly be entertaining, but it is. Trust me; you can't just listen to the audio CD's one time, like you can't just eat one potato chip.

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I am very disappointed in this last novel. I am not sure what has happened to Sparks.  I hope he comes back with something better than this.  Not worth 12 bucks.  Should be on the .99 rack!  Too far off, too many characters, all over the place, not close to real, low, sad, depressing, what can I say.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!

0307272702|5.0|This knowledge is absolutely life-saving. I watched my mom struggle with her weight for her entire life. Dieting made her miserable. But she tried so many times- with every weight loss company in town... Taking hand fulls of vitamin pills and eating those awful little packaged meals, checking in for weigh-ins.   It all seemed to end up making her get bigger. Now I understand why. If only she'd had the chance that I now have, to steer onto a different course. For YEARS I ate a low fat, almost vegetarian, low protein, very high carb diet. And my weight inched up and up. Then it jumped up a good deal when I quit smoking. A year ago I found myself hungry all the time. I was tested and was not found to be diabetic (yet) but the signals were there that I was quickly headed for it. Losing weight has been difficult, but after an adjustment period getting off the carbs, I eventually found myself adapting and then suddenly feeling much better than I had in a long time. I'm a total foodie and I like to cook. There are still a lot of really yummy foods I can make and eat! (Ask me about my shaved zucchini with alfredo sauce- yum!)  I just wish this way of eating had been available for my mom. If only we'd known this was an option. I sincerely believe she would have been able to stick to this way of eating- there are so many satisfying foods when you can eat fat! She was also a foodie (back before there was such a thing)- she loved to cook.  She died as a direct result of the many health problems caused by her obesity. She died too young and the last years were really rough. I'm trying not to go down the same path. Thank you, Gary Taubes.

B004XGN8W4|4.0|This is an awesome product! The speakers are really good and can go as loud as some TV's, only difference being that the G155 has almost no bass. That being said the speakers still get the job done and there is always the option of plugging in 2 sets of headphones. I find the space in side the case is a little limited once I put the massive XBOX 360S power brick inside...so I have opted to carry my controllers in a separate bag. If you have a lot of games your going to need a separate bag to carry them anyway as there is no room for them inside the case. Instead of carrying around a bunch of game cases though I simply purchased a CD holder with room for about 50 discs, small and doesn't take up much space slips right down into my work bag. One of my biggest gripes with the case is that once you open it the TV automatically falls back to an awkward angle, so that the best viewing angle for the screen is never sitting directly in front of it, you would have to be looking down at it to not see the dark edges. Which is fine when placing it on a surface lower than where you are sitting, but sucks when placing it on say a dinning room table. to get around this little hump I have placing my CD case underneath the TV end of the case just to prop it up a bit or bracing it against the wall and this has worked just fine. When watching a movie or Netflix it really sucks not to have a remote for volume, and I know that they are supposed to release one for purchase but it should be free (all TVs come with one remote.) The case is handsome and sturdy and I feel confident carrying it that my contents are safe. All in all I would absolutely recommend this case to others. Way to go GAEMS!   PS. Who do I contact about buying this remote?

B004LROUNG|4.0|FYI, I received this book at no cost as a part of a bzzagent campaign.  The Litigators by John Grisham arrived in the mail about a week before its official release date of October 24th. It came with a letter from the publisher indicating that The Litigators was not the typical John Grisham novel and, in their opinion, it was rather comedic.  I thought of the last couple of book I'd read that made me laugh. I had to think back a bit because it's not my typical genre. The Actor and the Housewife by Shannon Hale made me laugh. Out loud. As cheesy as it was, I loved it. So, I opened The Litigators expecting a couple of laughs.   I didn't laugh. Not unreserved, anyway. The Litigators starts off by introducing some pretty interesting characters. They have richly spun back stories that barely need telling by the time you get to know them. You just \\"know\\" their history because you've probably known someone like them.  While they are interesting and and have depth, they are not funny unless you enjoy laughing at sad, broken people.   The story is that of struggling street lawyers, pharmaceutical companies, prescription drug deaths, unhealthy (i.e. fat) people, alcoholics, unemployment, and incompetence. Not funny. BUT...not a bad book. I wish that letter from the publisher would have stayed stuck in the book between the last two pages. THEN I would have laughed. Out loud.   Comedy claims aside, the book was a typical John Grisham book to me. It was full of characters I came to care about, moral and legal issues I have heard and read about and bit of personal triumph thrown in for the win.  {Spoiler alert} The `law firm' of Finley and Figg consists of two mis-matched, underachieving, over 40 lawyers handling divorce and injury cases just to survive.  Along comes a chance at striking it rich by riding on the coattails of a Big Pharma lawsuit.  Finley and Figg, along with recently acquired associate/big law firm drop-out(another mis-match), David Zinc, throw all they have intothe case and hope for a big payday. Through a series of misfortunes and betrayals, the case never pans out and they lose everything. Lucky for the firm, David has another big case going on the side and saves the day. Happy ending, right? Well, not exactly. The last few pages of the book are an epilogue. A Short one. Basically, everyone goes their separate ways. Because you know these people, you're not surprised. You figured it was coming eventually and would have written the epilogue in your mind anyway.  You know, the Breakfast Club `different social circles, thrown together for a time' scenario. But in a law firm. And over a longer period of time.   Overall, I enjoyed reading The Litigators and would recommend it to fans of John Grisham and legal fiction. And the Breakfast Club.

B000XR4OC0|4.0|These shoes feel great but stretch even after a week. My wife had to return these and get a smaller size because of how much they stretched. Also, be sure to try on the exact same kind of shoe that you plan on purchasing. My wife knew about the stretching but tried on another version of the Toms. The 7's fit very snug in the store but the canvas shoes she ordered were much looser even in the same size. This is a great product but it's difficult to peg down exactly which size you need.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I grew up reading Tintin. Tintin was created by a Herge (his pen-name) in 1929. It is the most widely published cartoon series in the world, having sold over 200 million copies. Tintin is the protagonist of the series, a reporter and adventurer who travels around the world with his dog Snowy. Throughout much of the series, Tintin's attitude is characterised by inquisitive tendencies and a noble, forgiving nature. I can't wait for the Bluray to come out! I hope that Spielberg has created a magical animation.

B0012BQ60O|5.0|I purchased this figure, along with several others of the Schleich line, and was amazed at how well crafted and beautiful they truly are. The figures are well sculpted, well painted, and very durable - meaning that if I WAS to let my son have a go at them, they could hold up to the punishment.<br /><br />They are accurately detailed, with no traces of 'fantasy' or 'mythology' to them - no flaming swords, or oddly shaped weapons and armour. The knights are superbly crafted and historically designed.<br /><br />If I may quote the previous post of EquisNiger: \\"The pieces come in two opposing camps: the Red Fleur de Lis, and the Blue Lion, and each piece has a corresponding piece in the other, with somewhat different design and graphics. This reflects an impressive variety in styles of armament and armor of the period, and vastly improves the educational value of the series. \\"<br /><br />In all, I give this line of figure and their accessories Two Thumbs Up!
1591843790|1.0|Kawasaki presented nothing new in this book, ideas in the books are not something profound.

B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe is a great series.  It just gets even better season by season.  The characters are growing and Walter is just an absolute kick in the pants.  He relieves the seriousness of some of the episodes with his 60's humor.  This may not be for everyone, but I  have introduced many people to this series and they are as hooked as I am.  I would rather buy each series so I can watch them all together undisturbed.

1594202710|2.0|The book is worth reading. And yet, a novice to the subject of China, its history, and especially China's foreign relations, should be advised to take Dr. Kissinger's analysis with great caution and skepticism. Kissinger analysis is at times very interesting, at times pretentious, and, unfortunately, very often naïve. Of course he \\"was there,\\" he experienced a great deal of what he describes, and certainly he had studied the subject. But instead of helping his analysis, his own experience stands on the way of objectivity.  First, Kissinger is in awe of Mao Zedong. Mao can do no wrong for Kissinger. All Mao's decisions are based on meticulous planning; informed by the millenia of China's culture; and with long term considerations. In Kissinger's view, when Stalin maneuvers in some negotiations, he is conniving and conspiring, but when Mao is doing the same, he is planning, he is thinking, and following ancient Chinese strategy. Historical facts do not sustain that picture. Although Mao clearly was very skillful revolutionary, his behavior was also very erratic and often reckless. Kissinger rarely, if ever, admits that. For example The Great Leap Forward that led to famine and estimated 30-40 million deaths and set China back decades in economic development is barely mentioned by the author. The destructive and humiliating Cultural Revolution is actually presented in a positive light by Kissinger. Maybe he didn't intend the portrayal to be that way, but Kissinger writes about Cultural Revolution as it would be a political and philosophical campaign that simply didn't fulfill Mao's expectations. It was a \\"titanic struggle.\\" The fact that China's society and culture was almost destroyed doesn't seem to be bothering Kissinger that much. For him Mao is still the \\"philosopher king,\\" and no, there is no sarcasm in Kissinger's words.  Kissinger seems to be impressed by Mao's skillful use of poetry and ancient proverbs, but doesn't see the ignorant, paranoid, and delusional side of the man who was responsible for destructive policies throughout the 50 and 60s. That's why I would argue that Kissinger's portrayal of Mao is naïve.<br /><br />Second, Kissinger has an annoying habit of explaining all in terms of Chinese culture. Obviously, the culture does play an important role, but when all is explained by culture, nothing is. There is a \\"cultural explanation\\" for the Chinese being assertive in politics, and there is a \\"cultural explanation\\" when they are diffident. When they wait patiently when they are overrun by others, well, that's their culture, they know from thousands of years of history that the tide will turn one day. When they fight and resist, well, there is also some cultural explanation.<br /><br />Kissinger's analysis gets better the closer he gets to the present times.  Although he never abandons his respect for Mao, his description of the reforms under Den Xiaoping beginning in 1978 is fascinating, not so much the fact that China finally began economic expansion, but how difficult and even uncertain the reforms were in the early years.  Of course, Kissinger cannot avoid a constant reminder of his own importance throughout all these years.  His grandiosity is somewhat annoying (and that's why I said the book is at times pretentious).<br /><br />Finally, I would argue that the epilogue is the best part of the book:  a look into the future of China and U.S.-China relations.  In short, I am rather disappointed with the description and analysis of Mao's Years, but satisfied with the later parts of the book. And overall, knowing Henry Kissinger's work and writing, I expected a greater mind.side of the man who was responsible for destructive policies throughout the 50 and 60s.

B005DZMODI|1.0|First off, Marsalis never was a blues player.  At best, he plays an occasional facsimile of the blues.  But it's not the real thing.  Clapton, however, has been able to play/sing the real blues at times.  Not as often as one might wish, but he's a far more sincere, real artist than Wynton can ever hope to be.  This whole affair is just so much contrived crapola, however.  Makes the Chess London Sessions sound like super-deep blues by comparison.  Phony baloney here, hear?
1451648537|3.0|The altar of Steve Jobs needs to be put into perspective.  Yes, he was a brilliant techno geek and product visionary -- but also a ruthless one, too.  His refusing to acknowledge the daughter born out of wedlock and then his standing by while she and her mother survived for years by the grace of welfare, was despicable.  Apple/Jobs created expensive gadgets that far too many people now think they can't live without.  But Jobs did not invent a cure for cancer, or heart disease, or diabetes, or even try to end poverty in America.  He was not a New Age Thomas Edison (Jobs could not have created Apple computers and toys without the electricity needed for them).  He wasn't a Louis Daguerre, nor one of the Wright brothers -- and definitely not a Marie Curie.  Jobs innovated and improved ideas and devices that already existed, even if in another form, but he did not invent a single product: computer? already invented; iPhone? mobile phones with screens already in use; iPod? put a transistor radio and jukebox together; iPad? fuse a laptop with a cell phone. As for iTunes? The digital service was introduced in 2001, after Napster had perfected music file sharing in 1999. Perhaps if he had insisted that all his creations be manufactured in the U.S.A., instead of China and anywhere cheaper labor could be found with government-subsidized companies, he might have made a significant dent in the shareholder-is-god corporate system. While reading his biography is interesting and much has already been said about what it does or doesn't get right, and even if the techno-toy generation doesn't know their names or what they accomplished in their time, Jobs was simply just one of the many industrialists who have come before, are here today, and which will leave their mark in the future.

B005VPSEK2|5.0|As a die hard Kelly Clarkson fan, I will admit this isn't her best album in my opinion, on a 1 to 10 scale, I give it an 8 or a 9, it is really good, but not as good as Breakaway or All I Ever Wanted; This album has several great songs, but also a few mediocre at best songs.  The best songs on this album are: What Doesn't Kill You(Stronger), Mr. Know It All, Dark Side, Einstein, Honestly & I Forgive You.  I do love this album alot & I do highly recommend buying it!!!  The Deluxe Editon of Stronger has 4 extra songs that the regular edition does not, Including her hit duet with Jason Aldean: Don't You Wanna Stay!!!  Overall a super-duper really good album:-)

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|The download now works properly without prompting for payment. Try closing your browser and reopening it. I will try to review the app soon.  UPDATE:  I've played around with the app and can say it is very good for a mobile office suite. It handles word documents quite well and does a good job of displaying them on a smaller screen. Excel works, but more complex formulas seem to confound it - I am not surprised. The Google docs integration is quite nice and was able to sync edits back to the cloud seamlessly. I'd probably stick with Adobe Reader for pdfs as it is much faster. I also did get a couple messages saying I ran out of memory when trying to open some very large files - but this is likely a limitation of my phone's hardware (Droid X: 512mb RAM).   I think the retail price of $15 would be hard to swallow although it is in line with the competition. I was glad to be able to pick this up as the free app of the day but would even have been willing to pay five or six bucks for it given it's nice interface and good functionality.

It's clear a lot of thought and work went into the sequel.  this game is very complex in both graphics and style. Very polished, but the game play stays true to the original.

Good job, developers, for putting care into your product.

B002OG5GT8|2.0|I was looking for an inexpensive way to increase the audio out of my laptop, specifically for watching movies on an airplane.  I don't have the most expensive pair of noise cancelling headphones, but they are pretty decent.  Depending on where I'm seated on the plane, sometimes it's just difficult to hear even with the volume all the way up.  I read lots of reviews before purchasing, and hoped this would do the trick, but honestly, it didn't make a bit of difference in the volume.  What it DID do was make the audio sound just a tiny bit better, but this was only noticeable when there was no other outside noise.  Based on other reviews, this has worked for most people, but just didn't do the trick for me.
0439023521|3.0|The Hunger Games is an unoriginal concept with uninteresting characters with uninteresting emotions. However, I hated myself for getting caught up with it enough that I read the book in less than a week. There are no twists and turns, and I believe that this would be a phenomenal book if it was written by a teenager.   It's like a poor man's version of Ender's Game. I wanted to read it before the movie comes out, but I regret my decision and wished I just waited.

B0037KMHRY|4.0|When the news broke a few years ago that non other than electronic music legends Daft Punk were going to score the music for the \\"Tron\\" 2010 reboot, it raised a lot of expectations among Daft Punk fans.<br /><br />\\"Tron: Legacy\\" (22 tracks; 59 min.) starts off with the \\"Overture\\" (of course), followed by \\"The Grid\\", the only spoken-piece on this (featuring Jeff Bridges). But shortly after that, we are into a full-blown symphonic soundtrack, in which the electronic music is kept to a minimum (but for a few exceptions, more on that later). The general tone of the soundtrack is quite dark and threatening and the London Orchestra shines throughout. It culminates for me in tracks 9 \\"Outlands\\", with fantasic orchestral interplay, and 10 \\"Adagio for Tron\\", featuring a beautifully pensive orchestra. The \\"true\\" Daft Punk sound only comes in a couple of tracks from the nightclub scene in the movie (and in which the guys from Daft Punk make a hilarious brief appearance--when I saw it for the first time, I blurted out to myself \\"OMG, there's Daft Punk!\\").<br /><br />In all, I quite enjoy this soundtrack more than I expected, but then again I love classical music and symphonic movie soundtracks. I have to say that I have been bewildered by the praise from many Daft Punk fans for this release, as this truly has nothing to do with the \\"usual\\" Daft Punk music, but to which I can only say that there are lots of other worthy symphonic soundtracks out there worth checking out, if that is really your thing. For the Daft Punk fans who want the \\"true\\" Daft Punk sound, check out instead the \\"Tron: Legacy Reconfigured\\" album. Last but not least, a shoutout to my son, who bought this for me as a gift some time ago, for no reason (other than knowing I would like this), just because he felt like it. Thanks Rick!
B005PW3OS8|4.0|CAPTAIN AMERICA succeeds on so many levels that it is difficult to list them all.  But perhaps one of the most refreshing aspects of this film is that it treats the story in a time frame (WW II) that makes the 'supernatural heroes and villains' seem like operatically overstated normal people.  Opening the film with the superhero as a skinny nerdy but ethical and committed to do good kid and then see him transform into the hero of heroes who for once is doing good things because he cares about his fellowmen and his country makes for a feel good experience.  Dapple that with some old-fashioned 1940s Rockettes type dance sequences and keep the 'impossible gimmicks' down to a level of near credibility and you have a winner.<br /><br />Quick, borrowed plot outline: 'It is 1942, America has entered World War II, and sickly but determined Steve Rogers is frustrated at being rejected yet again for military service. Everything changes when Dr. Erksine recruits him for the secret Project Rebirth. Proving his extraordinary courage, wits and conscience, Rogers undergoes the experiment and his weak body is suddenly enhanced into the maximum human potential. When Dr. Erksine is then immediately assassinated by an agent of Nazi Germany's head of its secret HYDRA research department, Johann Schmidt aka the Red Skull, Rogers is left as a unique man who is initially misused as a propaganda mascot. However, when his comrades need him, Rogers goes on a successful adventure that truly makes him Captain America and his war against Schmidt begins.'  And that about says it all.<br /><br />Now, populate this story with a cast of first rate actors - Chris Evans as the magnificent Adonis built Steve Rogers/Captain America, Stanley Tucci as Dr Erskine, Hayley Atwell as the sole 'love interest' Peggy Carter (Natalie Dormer does have a few seconds of screen time, too), Tommy Lee Jones as the military guy in charge, Sebastian Stan as Steve's best buddy, Dominic Cooper (a good guy), and a set of villains starting with Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, Toby Jones as Dr.Zola, Richard Armitage as Heinz Kruger and then fill in the spare parts with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Kenneth Choi, JJ Feild, Bruno Ricci, Michael Brandon, Martin Sherman  etc and the results are almost guaranteed to be good.<br /><br />Joe Johnston directs the film in a propulsive fashion that takes time out for some humanity amid all the military derring-do and allows just the right amount of sarcasm and humor (courtesy the screenplay by  Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) and it all comes out 'just swell'. A terrific night's entertainment!

B005UT29Z0|5.0|MARGIN CALL is a 24 hour distillation of an example of the economic meltdown this country and the world has been and is currently experiencing. Though the film is very well crafted and is populated with some of our finest actors it is an exceptionally disturbing look at greed and all its permutations. The only aspect of the film that makes it less devastating to watch is the manner in which the story is told - through the eyes of the people involved in the crisis and how it affects them as well as those they have financially and morally abused and destroyed.<br /><br />The film opens with the Investment Banking downsizing firing of Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), a veteran of 19 years with the firm who is on the brink of making a shattering discovery. His boss Sam Rogers (Kevin Spacey) simply tells him he is through and has him escorted out of the building, cutting off all ties with the firm: Eric passes a file to one of his young co- workers, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto) as he is exiting the building via the elevator stating 'Be Careful'. During the day many others are let go and informed of their separation packages. Tension builds as Peter downloads the information form Eric and discovers that the firm is on th brink of destruction form greedy overselling to clients: collapse seems imminent. It is now night and Peter calls his co-worker Seth (Penn Badgley) back to the office along with another boos Will Emerson (Paul Bettany) and as the situation terrifies them all they inform the Human Resources people Jared Cohen (Simon Baker) and Sarah Robertson (Demi Moore) who realize the gravity of the situation and ask the owner of the firm John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) to come to the firm in the middle of the night to inform him of the calamity. The only choice seems to be to sell out everything and close the company, an act that would further betray the clients of the firm and causes considerable conflict among the firm's staff. Everyone seems to trust Sam and will follow his advice as to go through with the questionable sell junk bonds to loyal clients in order to not collapse. Each of the people involved in the action has a personal fear, and Sam is particularly vulnerable because he has been informed his beloved dog is dying from a tumor (one of the few suggestions that these people may have a vulnerable aspect to their psyches. How the announcement is made and the actions taken as the sun comes up on this night of terror gives the audience a first hand look of that hideous moment in 2008 when the markets failed, injuring millions of people's lives.<br /><br />JC Chandor wrote and directed this film and offers an impressive debut - and a lot of courage bringing a film with this topic to the screens at this point in time. Many viewers may find that there is too little character development in this script, but consider the time frame of the film - less than 24 hours in one of the worst crises of this country - and realize that this may be a statement about the corporate personality: no matter the gravity of the result of crashing they think basically about their job stability. Every one in the cast is memorable, right up to the end of the film when we finally meet Mary McDonnell as Sam's ex-wife questioning Sam's digging a grave for his dog in his previous home's yard. It is a moment of agony that adds a smidgen of idea that the characters involved so indeed have souls.<br /><br />This is a very disturbing film about a very disturbing subject, made all the more disturbing by the fact that it forces us to look at an act the affected the lives of all of us.

B005QYKE2Y|2.0|and a complete waste of electricity.  Michael Bay has not been hungry for years, therein lies the problem. Let's see what happens in the inevitable sequel.
B004EPZ084|1.0|HORRIBLE BOSSES is. Why there is a continuing need to put films of this sort before the market is cause for concern. The story is ludicrous - maybe playing out the fantasies most people control about disliking their 'bosses' is OK but actually showing it is another item altogether. Potty mouth dialogue, sociopathic behavior supposedly masked by three guys who 'really aren't all that bad', and placing the roles of Bosses who are over the top obnoxious and maladaptive in the hands of actors of the caliber of Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Anniston, and Colin Farrell is a gross waste of talent. Then padding the 'story' with appearances (albeit brief) by Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, Jamie Foxx and especially Ioan Gruffudd - there must be some favors owed somewhere.<br /><br />It is a committee written script (Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein) and it shows: this is more a disconnected series of standup comedian jokes than a story. Seth Gordon directs with a heavy hand on exasperatingly gross language and sexual innuendoes, insulting just about everybody possible. The only saving grace about this 'film' is the comedic timing by Jason Bateman and his cohorts in crime - Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis. There are some funny lines but the sorry mess you have to wade through to get to them is hardly worth the effort. It is an embarrassingly poor film, but as with the popularity of The Hangover et al it sells tickets. Sad. Grady Harp, October 11

B004I8WD7S|4.0|We have been searching for iPhone case for our new iPhone 4S. Earlier we had ordered silicon gel case from Amazon (don't want to name it) and found it did not fit for AT&T iPhone 4 & 4S (look like some manufacturing defect). We got refund by Amazon for the defective piece received (Thanks Amazon). We found this product and ordered after seeing positive review for iPhone 4S.  Pros:   - Timely delivery as promised by Amazon   - Thicker than silicon gel case and flexible too   - Black color case suits for black iPhone 4S (for best look)   - Well designed mount might protect if iPhone dropped facing front side   - It's not covering the screen   - It's not blocking any of accessory ports  We did not give 5* sine we wanted to have a fully covered case for our iPhone 4S. Amazon has designed Apple logo to be visible from the back side of the phone. Also Amazon had put their logo back side of the cover which is visible. The above does not matter when one need a quality case for the best iPhone :) We recommend this product if the above Pros meets your requirements!   Thanks Amazon for the good product!
B005VGWT2K|3.0|We'll soon be marking the tenth anniversary of George Harrison's death, this project has been in the works for quite some time and I find myself torn over this release.  As a Beatles fan, a George fan, I was excited to see the documentary being broadcast on HBO in two parts totaling nearly four hours.  Here is the first issue-why only four hours?  A life such as Harrisons' deserves much more.  If four hours is all you're allotted, make the most of it!  Although the first part of the film focuses primarily on The Beatles, it is not entirely chronological-this may please some, but I found it irritating.  Most can agree that one of the incredible aspects of this band is how quickly they developed; musically and personally.  This film jumps back and forth so much, it gives the viewer a sense of confusion or, even worse, haphazard movie-making.  Within the first hour, we are shown George's devotion to Ravi Shankar, the sitar before we really understand why!  Very poor editing.  There are lots of unseen photos and film clips which is fantastic-just keep them in some kind of order, Mr. Scorsese!  There are interviews with many of George's intimates yet we're given just a few lines from, say, Eric Clapton, cut to some photos, then back to Clapton via Ringo Starr!  The majority of the interviews are fascinating.  Pattie Boyd, Eric Clapton, Paul, Ringo, the list goes on.  It's too bad that Pattie is given short-shrift as this is a great opportunity for her to lend her insight into a younger George.  Klaus Voorman and Astrid Kirschner are similarly treated.  What a pity.  Even Yoko Ono makes a brief appearance which comes off as being awkward at best.  Moving on to the music.  With such an enormous wealth at his disposal, Mr.Scorsese really blows it.  I can't recall one song of George's being played in full throughout this movie and I've watched it twice!  The music is butchered.  Thirty seconds into a song, cut to a snippet of an interview. A perfect example of this is with Clapton talking about the evolution of 'Here Comes the Sun'. Song, cut to Clapton, song, cut to Ringo, etc.  While Harrison's faith is discussed throughout the movie, it should have been woven into the story in a better manner that we can understand and appreciate.  Thirty seconds into a song-cut to interview.  Part two doesn't fare much better production-wise, but is still packed with tons of unseen, unreleased footage and an emotional ending featuring Olivia Harrison, George's second wife.  Very open, very moving.  Son Dhani is interviewed and also serves as something of a narrator.  Many fans will certainly enjoy this very much, I felt it deserved four out of five stars simply because the man hasn't received this kind of treatment after all these years.  But beware, lots of the material you'll see were simply lifted from the Beatles Anthology Series released back in the 90's.  In the end, we're not left understanding this extraordinary individual any better...how did this one man have such an amazing impact on the world?  Maybe we'll never know-maybe we're not supposed to.  I'm guessing this film will be reworked into a director's cut or an 'extended' version for dvd.  We'd love to see what was left on the cutting room floor!

0062101897|5.0|This new addition to my Harry Potter bookshelf is more than worthy of the considerable amount of space I had to clear for it. Page to Screen offers a more narrative and linear look at the making of all eight Potter films than its predecessor, Film Wizardry, with a more encyclopedic tone. That's not to say that this book isn't beautiful to look at; every single page features concept art, stills, or production photos, greatly enhancing the prose. Overall though, the pages are much more geometrically oriented, with text and pictures appearing in blocks, rather than the scrapbook style of Film Wizardry (and both are fantastic!)  The book is organized into two sections and almost feels like two books in one. Part one is a narrative of the making of each film, and part two highlights the people (and creatures), places, and things of Harry's world. Part one is more text-heavy and features numerous quotes from people who worked on all aspects of the films. One thing that I particularly appreciated was the (near) equal attention spent on each film. It is clear that every single decision about these films was made with love and care, with artistic considerations rather than monetary ones. Although we definitely learn about some of this in Film Wizardry, there is plenty of new information in this tome that makes it well worth the purchase. Learning more about the process of making these films and all of the thought that went into them helps the reader appreciate the films as more than a movie version of the books.   The second part is much more picture-heavy with \\"articles\\" about characters, props, sets, and creatures and resembles an encyclopedia. The artwork and stills in these sections are not just beautiful, they're eye-opening and are a testament again to the amount of thought, hardwork, and love that went into every part of these movies.  At 520 pages (and huge pages at that), this book has so much to offer by way of insights into and information about making the Harry Potter films. That being said, a second book of equal size and measure could undoubtedly be made without any overlapping information. Mind you, this is not a flaw of Page to Screen, just a request for a second volume :). My one small gripe with this book is that many times a prop or costume will be mentioned or discussed in the main body of the text without an accompanying picture. This is irksome when I want to look at the details being talked about rather than try to remember them.  With all of this being said, I can confidently recommend this book to any fan of the series, and even film making in general. I will be returning to this book for years to come.
B005HXGE9G|4.0|I have to say I am bias in this review.  I saw the 3d concert/movie in the theater when it was out.  The experience there was awesome.  The experience from the CD good.  The disappoint aspect was mental in part and musical in another.<br /><br />The mental part was that I was really moved in the theater.  I felt like I was one of the audience or maybe even something better.  I felt the songs.  The CD was a faithful presentation of the concert, but without the visual it just wasn't the same.<br /><br />The musical part of this was not all the songs were there.  You should obviously know that if you look at the playlist, but I really would have wanted \\"Book of Love\\" to be one of the songs put on the CD rather than left out.<br /><br />Just so I don't leave you with a bad taste.  The CD is good.  And the 2nd bonus CD without Peter's singing is great as background music when you want to have something planying and not find yourself sing along :-)

1442300051|4.0|THE BIG SHORT: INSIDE THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE by Michael Lewis.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />I didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did.  It's nonfiction.  It's true stories behind three groups of investors who bet against the subprime mortgage market.  It was well done and kept my interest.  I was fascinated watching these groups, and it was fun seeing them \\"win\\" in the end.  During the story I was amazed at the arrogance, incompetence, and bad judgment of AIG (the insurance company who offered this insurance and received premiums) and the large investment firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  I was also angry at the two rating agencies, Moody's and S&P.  They didn't do their job.  They gave high ratings to these loans, which meant outsiders would be willing to buy them.  See below for more on this.<br /><br />Then, I was depressed at the end of the book when the author talked about the bailout by the US government.  Billions of taxpayer dollars were given to many different banks, brokerage firms, and companies.  My personal conclusion is that SOME of these companies should NOT have been given bailout money.  Some of those might have failed, but it wouldn't kill our economy.  Others could have absorbed the losses and still be around, but their management and shareholders would be a little poorer.  For more on this see Wikipedia, search TARP.<br /><br />Most of my reading is fiction for relaxation and fun.  This book does not fit those criteria.  It's too cerebral.  But I enjoyed it as an audiobook.<br /><br />WHAT ARE SUBPRIME MORTGAGES AND THE BET:<br />This book is about the subprime mortgages causing (or making worse) the real estate collapse in 2007.  An immigrant migrant farm worker comes to the US.  He has no past credit history.  An unscrupulous mortgage loan officer gives the worker a $750,000 loan to buy a house with low payments for two years, then huge payments would begin.  The bankers group a thousand of these loans into one package and call it a bond.  They sell the bond to others.  Michael Burry was the first person who approached an investment banking firm asking if he could buy an insurance policy that would pay him the face amount of the loans if the loans went bad.  In return Michael would pay a yearly insurance premium.  AIG said we'll take your premium payments and write the insurance for you.  This insurance policy is called a credit default swap.  Michael expected the loans to go bad at the two year mark, and then be foreclosed upon.  Michael had nothing to do with the loans.  He was like a gambler going to Las Vegas to place a bet.<br /><br />I AM ANGRY AT THE RATING AGENCIES:<br />The two biggest rating agencies are Moody's and S&P.  Moody's assigns ratings to bonds. Aaa is the safest, A is in the middle, B is the lowest.  Most companies (and investors) have policies to only buy bonds with a certain rating.  If the rating agencies had done their job, many companies would NOT have bought the bad bonds and not have needed the bailout.<br /><br />Goldman Sachs (GS) and others did misleading things. That didn't surprise me.  I'm sure other companies and banks have plenty of skepticism when dealing with them.  So the big problem here was S&P and Moody's.  I'm editing the following for brevity and clarity (page 171).  Vinny asks the S&P analyst Ernestine for details about the loans behind one of these bonds, for example, the types of borrowers, terms, and property locations of the loans.  Ernestine said she didn't have that information.  Wall Street issuers like Goldman Sachs \\"won't give it to us.\\"  Vinny said \\"You need to demand to get it!\\"  She said \\"We can't do that.\\"  Vinny said \\"Who is in charge here?  You're the cop.  Tell them to give it to you!!!\\"  Vinny's partner concluded that \\"S&P was worried that if they demanded the data from Wall Street, Wall Street would just go to Moody's for their ratings.\\"  An email was later produced in testimony to Congress from an S&P managing director (to his rating analysts) that said \\"Any request for loan-level tapes is TOTALLY UNREASONABLE!!  Most originators don't have it and can't provide it.  Nevertheless we MUST produce a credit estimate.  It is your responsibility to provide those credit estimates and your responsibility to devise some method to do so.\\"  My thoughts:  I was so angry at S&P and Moody's!  They are supposed to be the independent agencies telling us what we are buying.  And they are not doing their job because they don't want to upset who-is-paying-the-bill for the rating?  I wonder what happened to the writer of that email?<br /><br />NARRATOR:<br />The narrator Jesse Boggs was excellent.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Unabridged audiobook reading time: 9 hrs and 27 mins.  Swearing language: strong (a lot of quotes).  Sexual content: none.  Setting: 2006 to 2009 mostly U.S.  Book copyright: 2010.  Genre: financial nonfiction.OTALLY UNREASONABLE!!

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|A story that may resonate with most of us.  Realistic portrayal of psychics, the fakes, the real, and what happens to some regular people when they must face that life does continue after dying.  I loved all the performances, and Matt Damon was great.  Not what may be expected from him, and so wonderful.  Believable.  No suspension of disbelief required.  The scene of the tsunami was filmed in Kihei, Hawaii.  What was funny was the locals they got for the parts of the shop keepers in the big market, the guys on the boat, all local Hawaiian residents.  The place was never given a name, but even that the place seemed to be a south seas country, the English spoken was really good, and this didn't detract from the movie one bit.  The music is lovely.  The twin boys are great.  The French woman was sweet and smart and subtle.  What I found good was that the ending is solid.  You know what's going to happen even though it hasn't happened yet.  And it's a happy ending, too, and not sappy or soppy or melodramatic.  Which must have been hard to do considering the story and that the ending was good.  A beautiful movie.

B003L77FYS|3.0|We really enjoyed Season 1 & 2.  What made them enjoyable and different from all the other gruesome detective stories was the humor and banter between characters.  Somewhere in Season 3, that all got lost, maybe a new writer, who knows.  It became more of a series of personal danger events rather than solving crimes together.  Very dark and serious (and unrealistic) and a real loss to the series.  Buy Season 1 & 2 by all means, but season 3 maybe not.

B0057RBR6M|5.0|Aside from this original release I have the re-mastered version on CD, but tend to prefer listening to the good old vinyl, even if it has gathered a few scratches over the years. Being one of this band's very early releases, \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\" still has got a rougher sound and a clearly recognizable punk element. Combined with the minimalism, the Dark Wave characteristics and the paramount vocals of Robert Smith the songs strongly deliver a feel that immediately reminds me of my adolescence in the 80s and several initial experiences. In a way, to me the music and these experiences are closely connected, as the songs could be heard on the first parties I remember to have attended as well as oftentimes at friend's homes. At that time The Cure still used to be a fringe band and had little in common with the music they played later on when they became more popular. What I do especially appreciate is that this record has certainly awoken my interest to discover punk music.

The author was was given complete freedom to write the book without any control from Steve Jobs and it has been well put together from over a few years of interviews from Jobs any many others who were part of his life journey.  Like the book put it, \\"parts of his life and personality are extremely messy and that's the truth, and he didn't want it whitewashed, its a remarkable story told truthfully.\\"

0385534639|5.0|A novel is an intimate invitation to enter an author's imagination, a world sacrosanct if not downright sacred. The reader is obliged to accept the novelist's imaginary world on its own terms - not conforming to the reader's worldview or what we refer to as reality. The distinction, of course, is one of comparison or complement: Is the work like other books we like to read, or does it satisfy us on a deeper level because it reflects our own personal needs, values, emotions, perceptions, beliefs? Is the author's imaginary world desirable enough that the reader is eager to invest the time and their own imagination to visit it for the requisite commitment and emotional investment? More important, love it or hate it, will reading the novel change the reader's life or experience of literature in some way? Will the reader remember the book? Take away important thoughts? Draw congruence and similtude with other works? Learn from the characters' experiences? Recommend it to a friend, perhaps even write a review?<br /><br />The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern has achieved all these objectives for me. From a fellow writer's point of view, it is a masterpiece of fiction-writing. From a reader's viewpoint, Ms. Morgenstern not only creates an atmosphere I think of as magical realism, but does so with deft strokes of her imaginary paintbrush that are at once spare yet evocative: My imagination fills in what she (intentionally) leaves out. She seems to intuitively understand that to describe in too much detail would cause the reader to lapse into that pedestrian state of cognitive analysis we call comparison with reality.<br /><br />I don't read a novel to experience reality. I don't watch a movie to experience reality. I've got reality in front of me all the time. I read a novel or watch a movie to escape reality and enter another world where my imagination can play freely and have a great time. I had a great time playing in Ms. Morgenstern's imaginative world of The Night Circus.<br /><br />Ms. Morgenstern signed my copy at the Salem Literary Festival, where she read and answered questions. It was enchanting to hear her read, \\"The circus arrives without warning,\\" the novel's first sentence, because I could hear and feel her own enchantment with the idea. (A certain reviewer misread and obviously misinterpreted this as \\"a circus that occurs at night,\\" utterly missing the point that it is the Cirque des Rêves, or Circus of Dreams. Indeed, the novel itself is a circus of dreams, dreams within dreams and the magical, imaginary, worlds created by the characters within the world Ms. Morgenstern has created. In so doing, she evokes some of the most potent archetypes of the imagination. They draw the reader deeper into the characters' lives to learn how they fare, and into the story - the competition, the conflict between the characters, the reason for creating the night circus - in search of its meaning. Yet even though we are stimulated by the plot and character development, simply reading individual lines is a pleasure:<br /><br />\\"Alone in his flat, Marco constructs tiny rooms from scraps of paper. Hallways and doors crafted from pages of books and bits of blueprints, pieces of wallpaper and fragments of letters.<br /><br />\\"He composes chambers that lead into others that Celia has created. Stairs that wind around her halls.<br /><br />\\"Leaving spaces open for her to respond.\\"<br /><br />This novel is like a fine piece of crystal. The printed book itself is a wonderful work of art, not only for its cover image (which the author says is just what she would have wanted, had been asked by her publisher, which of course she wasn't) but also for the evocative, Victorian interior design. Be sure you read the chapter titles for the dates, because Morgenstern moves back and forth in time. So, you see, she controls not just reality, not just physical space, but time as well. And perhaps that's why it doesn't make sense to tell you about the story, orwhat happens with the characters, or much of anything because it would be using reality to describe this magical place in the imagination.would be using reality to describe this magical place in the imagination.
B005PMNBPY|1.0|None of what gets me going about JA is in this album. I can't relate to it at all. It could've been some other band just the same. I can't find that \\"no care in the world\\" rawness I liked so much before, that insolent punk-ish group of artists that produced rebellious but somehow positive music that gets you going and full of energy. So, sorry Jane, thanks for everything, but this is the end of the line for you and me :)
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a delightful look at England from the perspective of the very rural, very poor Lark Rise (a farming community) to the more prosperous (but still way off the main thoroughfare) Candleford.  The stories are set in the 19th century, a time where rapid change is coming to England (trains, bicycles, industrialization), but the life of the people isn't changing quite as fast.<br /><br />As usual in a (hopefully) multi-season television series, we have a core group of characters, in this case both in Lark Rise and in Candleford.  The symbolic link between the two towns, separated by a day's journey by foot, is the rise in fortune of<br />Laura Timmins, an educated young woman from Lark Rise, who moves to Candleford to become apprentice to the postmaster of Candleford (which serves both communities).  The Timmins family, consisting of the tough, but fair, father and loving and caring mother, are happy that she has improved her fate by moving to Candleford, but sad at the potential loss of their daughter to 'the big city'.  The postmistress of Candleford has the interesting name of Dorcus Lane.<br /><br />Sharing the small hamlet of Lark Rise with the Timmins family is the Arless family, particularly the son Alf, who is quite 'sweet' on Laura, whom he would probably marry if she stayed in Lark Rise.  But now that Laura has seen the city lights (gas), Alf is kind of out of the running, and now has the status of 'friend' to Laura (ouch!).  Alf proves to be a stalwart friend though, one that Laura and everyone else can count on to be a solid member of the Lark Rise community, even if he is a big rough around the edges.<br /><br />Another noteworthy couple in Lark Rise are Twister and Queenie.  Twister is a character who is beloved by all, but who hasn't put a solid days work in decades.  Queenie is totally devoted to Twister (and he, her), so their marriage does work, and they get by on her bee-keeping skills.<br /><br />Postmistress Dorcus has the bad habit of trying to make everyone's life a bit easier, which means she's taken advantage of by people and by fate.  She's always a bit in trouble with Her Royal Highness' Postal Office, which is an employer of rock-solid stability and respect.<br /><br />The list of main characters is rounded out by Dorcus' straight-laced helper, Thomas, and the spinster Pratt sisters with a complex background, Pearl and Ruby.<br /><br />This is a good look at the non-Jane Austen 19th century, Charles Dicken's 19th century England.  Instead of focusing on the very wealthy upper class of Austen, and the lower middle class, ragamuffin Dicken's characters, Lark Rise to Candleford focuses on the honest and proud, but poor, farmers of Lark Rise, and the town with the growing middle-class, Candleford<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Yeah, it's episodic television with hour-long, self-contained plots, but the over-all quality of the stories, the plots, the characters, the setting and the photography, just show how much better the Brits do at this sort of thing over anyone else.ife a bit easier, which means she's taken advantage of by people and by fate.

0062101897|5.0|A tome this most certainly is! Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey is a behemoth of a book, and I had not expected it to be this huge (not that I'm complaining). It is an oversized hardcover with an embossed photograph of Hogwarts on the cover. It looks like a magickal volume and in a way it is, for it captures all of the magic of the Harry Potter movies, from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all the way to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part Two. Any self-avowed fan of the HP stories and movies will treasure this beautiful volume filled with movie lore, and many more.<br /><br />The first color photograph one comes across as one flips the book open is a full size portrait of Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts (Michael Gambon, who played Dumbledore in HP films 3-8). His face expresses both concern and puzzlement, and it is almost as if he is there to welcome readers on a journey of knowledge and discovery which is what this book ultimately rewards the reader with. Flip to the next page, and one's attention is captured by a double-page (full spread) painting of Hogwarts, majestic in all its splendor, though details are rather fuzzy. There is also a fold-out spread of the main cast in movies 1-8 - the actors portraying Dumbledore, Hagrid, Hermione, Harry, Ron, Snape, Lucius Malfoy, Prof McGonagall, Luna Lovegood, Ginny Weasley, the twins Fred and George, the Dark Lord, and many more.<br /><br />So, the contents...the book (531 pages) is divided into three parts:<br />Part I: The Making of Harry Potter<br />Introduction<br />Setting the Scene<br />HP and the Sorcerer's Stone<br />HP and the Chamber of Secrets<br />HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban<br />HP and the Goblet of Fire<br />HP and the Order of the Phoenix<br />HP and the Half-Blood Prince<br />HP and the Deathly Hallows<br /><br />Part II: The Art of Harry Potter<br />Introduction<br />Characters: Costuming<br />Locations: Set Design<br />Creatures: Special Makeup and Digital Effects<br />Artifacts: Prop Making<br /><br />Part III: Epilogue<br />The Golden Boards<br />Acknowledgements and Colophon<br /><br />The book goes in-depth into the many aspects of the film-making process, including valuable insights from and about the directors, actors, and all the other significant people who have worked on the movies, not forgetting the author of course. If you've ever wondered how the cast was put together, the process by which the directors for the movies were picked, etc. then this wonderful book answers all these questions and more. These details are enhanced by the hundreds of photographs that are found throughout the book, and what makes these pictures all the more extraordinary and valuable to the discerning reader is the fact that many of them were taken on set, during the making of the films, and apart from the photographs there are also full-color paintings in glorious detail. As a dragon fan myself, I was positively enraptured by the concept art of Paul Gatling depicting the mighty Hungarian Horntail in all its wondrous glory, which dare I say surpassed even the beauty of the dragon depicted on film? These are not minuscule drawings, but large-scale drawings in fold-out form. Other magical creatures get their share in this book such as the centaurs, dear old Buckbeak, the thestrals, the dementors, the process of transformation of Remus Lupin into a werewolf and many more. Be still my beating heart!<br /><br />Remember all those newspaper headlines from The Daily Prophet, the Quibbler editions, and the Wanted Posters? They are depicted here in detail and also in the case of The Quibbler, in color! Ever wondered about the inspiration for those Death Eater's Masks? Its covered here in full-color. The significant places in the world of Harry Potter - Hogwarts, Diagon Alley (loved the map), the Burrow, Hagrid's Hut, the Forbidden Forest, and many more are also given descriptions and explanations in this magnificent volume.<br /><br/>As I continue reading through this tome, I have found some little things to gripe about - certain characters, albeit minor ones, are not really given any coverage, just a mere mention. Remember the ghost that haunts the abandoned toilet in Chamber of Secrets, i.e. Moaning Myrtle? Just a mention and that's it. I would have loved to see at least some description of the filming of the bathroom scene in HP and the Goblet of Fire in which Moaning Myrtle makes another appearance and helps Harry puzzle out the riddle, but no such luck. The book does however go into detail about the second task and the glorious underwater lake scene in Goblet of Fire, and how the lifecasts were conceived and made. But poor Hedwig gets left out here - except for a brief mention on p.238 and concept art depicting Harry and Hedwig overlooking Hogwarts.<br /><br />Btw, for those who are wondering about how this compares to [[ASIN:0061997811 Harry Potter Film Wizardry]], I'd say they are both complementary (I own a copy of HP Film Wizardry) to each other. While Page to Screen provides more details on the movie-making process and covers just about everything (I say just about as there are some things not covered), Film Wizardry provides more of an overview with many fun elements thrown in for devoted fans such as the various foldouts and inserts. For example, in HP Film Wizardry, readers will get a chance to peruse a copy of the Marauder's Map, Harry's acceptance letter to Hogwarts, a catalogue from Borgin and Burke's, stickers in the Advanced Potion-Making pamphlet, two boxes of treats (sans the treats) from Honeydukes of Hogsmeade (you can tear them out and fold them into actual treat boxes, not that I would!), a Quidditch World Cup Programme, a copy of the Yule Ball Programme, Educational Decree No. 29, a product catalogue of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, and a Ministry of Magic ID card. Such goodies are not to be found in Page to Screen, so I'd definitely recommend getting both books. I've frequently found myself reading both together, and comparing notes.<br /><br />My one complaint here is the absence of an Index - how could they have produced such a wonderful companion book to the movies and not have an index to help readers look up any detail that springs to mind? I can't fathom it, but I envision myself spending lots of quality time enjoying the delights of this book, so I shall not let this trouble me too much:) In fact, I am sorely tempted to purchase another book to keep as a collector's item as I can see myself thumbing through this copy until it becomes dog-eared! This is a beautiful volume of substance for any fan of the HP books and movies./>As I continue reading through this tome, I have found some little things to gripe about - certain characters, albeit minor ones, are not really given any coverage, just a mere mention.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|great free app of the day. Constantly gets updated, very worthy and happy I got it for free.. worth the cash. half the price of documents to go and seems more robust. Works great on my motor xoom. haven't tested it on my tbolt
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Ok Wow !!!  In a word- WOW !!!  Frikken WOW !  Mike/Jason -you both friggin rock it manizzles !!  Romeo-Rullo have gone to the next level here. SX was always a force to be reckoned with but I am saying that they have taken the torch from Dream Theater and run ahead with it - far ahead. Both these guys have placed themselves firmly in the category of best in class and this CD freakin rocks the f out with tremendous musicianship and content !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There are some truly mood altering grooves, relevant technical musicianship, mind bending licks and best of all-MEMORABLE HOOKS. Be prepared to be stimulated in all areas of your listening desires as a prog metal rocker. Well thought out arrangements. Carefully crafted detail to flow and production. The mixdown is tremendous. Drums and guitar especially frikken succeed in their roles. Vocals and keys are strong and every moment of this work is completely satisfying to the discerning Prog musician listening enthusiast !!   The new DT cd would be crushed in my path to get to this tremendous CD.  For goodness sake, can we have a HD well produced live DVD Please ???  This would be the only thing that could top the CD.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I'm oh sooooooo thankful that they released season 1 box set   This is one of my favorite shows never missed an episode!!  And this is one show that keeps you always wondering and asking questions!!  And it always makes you watch thee episodes over and over again   Because you just can't get enough of PLL   ;D
0240815807|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best book on mixing I've read (and I've read dozens). A clever mix of technical insight, quick tips and shortcuts, straight talking, and discipline, not to forget occasional moments of great levity.   A delight and the sort of book you want to keep handy when mixing.
0810971496|5.0|Looking forward to reading this book. It is in remarkable shape. I will definately purchase more form you in the future.
0811879542|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandchildren (3-1/2 and 6)in Texas. It was mailed directly to them so I had to wait for feedback from their Mom.  They loved it!!  She wasn't too sure about it at first since it starts out rather slow and easy but once they saw the variety of things they could do with it they were hooked.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Saves me so much time as it literally predicts entire statements frequently used. Highly recommend, of course providing facebook, gmail and twitter account details is a loss of privacy but for me it's well worth it
B001QOGYBI|4.0|Read the book first and then watch the movie. We compared and contrasted between the book and the movie with my third grade students.
B005ER6STG|2.0|first off...this movie is in no way 103 minutes, it's rounded up.  Secondly i'm sure that a good portion of this flick was cut out for whatever reason. I have never watched the uncut version.  I didn't want a grainy bootleg, so shortly after i heard about this movie a while back I found out Invincible Pictures picked up the rights to it.  I was excited because they are also putting out a blu ray. I was super excited. Giddy like a school girl, but with all the giddiness i was sorely disappointed.  I was told that this movie would rip out my soul, put dirt on my hands that i couldn't scrub off...sadly I was disappointed. This film was cut so horribly to pieces that it lost all the power it had in the first place.   It's like watching Phantom of The Opera and having his mask ripped off and then just showing the woman screaming and not his face.  Or like watching the Usual Suspects and after Kevin Spacey leaves the room the movie ends.  If you really want a soul wrenching movie watch Requiem for a Dream or The Informers (not the best movie, but accomplished a lot in the soul wrenching department) or even better and I'm not a fan of bootlegs, get the real copy of this film on a torrent.  OH also the 2nd hit, my copy came with a free digital copy, I thought my final shot at redemption because you get to download it from Flix Fling.  To my knowledge this was the only way that you could see the uncut version ,legally, to my dismay they also changed it to the cut version which left an even more sour taste in my mouth.    The picture is great, the sound track isn't anything to write home to mom about, the acting was really quite good, also another punch in the face was no english dubbing. This all left me quite bitter, angry, and disappointed. Don't let this happen to you.  **Update**  For the record, I just watched the key scenes that, in my opinion, gave all the film the power of anything I have ever watched. I'm not sure if they would make sense or just shock you out of context, but because I knew the context that they were in, and just to see the film itself how it was meant to be, really made me want to throw up a little. My stomach kind of ached a bit. My theory was correct, the scenes made drove the point home, maybe more so than it needed to, but wow. I don't think I've reacted that way to a movie in ages. View at your own risk the full uncut version of this.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Cross posted from my blog.  I've just read Brynjolfsson and McAfee's Race against the Machine in one sitting when I have masses of other pressing stuff to do.  It is short, sharp, engaging and easy to read. Put down that Scandinavian crime novel, ignore your travel expense application issues and read this book instead. I'm perhaps reading too much into the title,  but I can't help wondering if it isn't a hat tip to the rock band Rage Against the Machine.  If it is, deeply nifty sub-editing coolness.  If not, it is a lovely  unintended consequence.  The book highlights the accelerating disruption that technology brings to the workplace and to the very definition of work. There is dark side to technology, and the authors have done a nuanced job in exploring this.  It makes a worthwhile change from the technology=progress drum beat.  It was especially good to see a section on the growing gap between wage  and productivity growth.  To see disquiet about median wage stagnation from technology focused researchers is a very fine thing.  There is more than a whiff of valorization in their argument.  Brynjolfsson and McAfee make excellent use of statistics, and this work is no exception. They use numbers to illuminate, and they do it well. The Bill Gates in a bar story is a lovely explanation of mean and median. They explain, but don't condescend.  As with much of US business academia, the book is centred on the US economy, with fleeting mentions of the rest of world.  I didn't spot the dreaded phrase \\"Corporate America\\", but it may have been lurking there. In particular the solution section was too US focused. Moaning about  H-1B visas etc... However suggestions 17,18, 19 are spot on.  17. Reduce the large implicit and explicit subsidies to financial services. This sector attracts a disproportionate number of the best and the brightest minds and technologies, in part because the government effectively guarantees \\"too big to fail\\" institutions.   18. Reform the patent system. Not only does it take years to issue good patents due to the backlog and shortage of qualified examiners, but too many low-quality patents are issued, clogging our courts. As a result, patent trolls are chilling innovation rather than encouraging it.  19. Shorten, rather than lengthen, copyright periods and increase the flexibility of fair use.  Copyright covers too much digital content. Rather than encouraging innovation, as specified in the Constitution, excessive restrictions like the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act inhibit mixing and matching of content and using it creatively in new ways.  There are strong echoes of Larry Lessig in the IP section (as an aside I'd like to get the authors' views of Lessig's recent work on political corruption).  More broadly though I'd like to see business school academia and IT research engaging more with the rich research tapestry of sociology and political philosophy, how about more Jessop and Harvey, and Herbert Marcusse needs a serious dust off.  I fancy I heard the very faint clang of  Weber's iron cage in this work. I'd suggest that Maslow and maybe Hayek can take a rest for a while.  This book is excellent,  but would have been seminal if it had built upon the work of that chap from Trier.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I got this app as a free download, so I can't really complain. But if I paid $14.00 for this app, I'd be upset because there are ads in it. The button to download a dictionary/thesaurus is basically an ad, and it should at least be removable.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|If you need to restore or put an edge on your trusty blade, this'll do the trick.  A must carry if you use your knife or bladed tool frequently.
0345529057|5.0|Nice and light books. Great for carrying around and travelling.   About the story... Well, it's just better than anything I've read in my entire life. It's fantasy, but it doesn't even looks like. Way better than Lord of the Rings, with wars, action dense polictics and characters. It's kind of dangerous, because when you start reading, you just can't stop. You will be thinking about theories and conspiracies all day long.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|This is so much fun to play with! Great quality too! this app gives pics a whole new life and dimension.
0553801473|5.0|Excellent! In this fifth book of the seven-book series, things unfold and many things stay open for the next books. The Starks are still eating the bread the devil kneaded, and the direwolves are incredibly important, but I  hope to see Dany going to Westeros and finishing the Lannisters. I just wish Martin would let sleeping dogs lie:)
0375414053|3.0|I don't know how to respond to this book. It deals with the working mother vs stay-at-home mother but the characterizations of both are so cliched it's hard to believe in either and thus I have no connection to either. The sexual harassment issue at work felt inaccurate to me -- even accounting for the difference in UK vs US work policies, there's no way the behavior of those men would have been tolerated, right? So the \\"sting\\" the women plot seems trumped up and silly.    As I read the book I wondered, How is the author going to resolve this? Kate Reddy (the main character) would either have to make a major change in the way she deals with her situation -- which she seemed incapable of doing -- or quit. She quits. Well, that felt rather uninspired. But then a new business opportunity comes up and she's back to where she started, up till the wee hours plotting her list of to dos. Are we to assume she's learned nothing? Feels awfully unfulfilling.  This book addresses an old tension between the moms working in offices and the moms who are, for the lack of another term, homemakers. It's a tension that can never be satisfactorily resolved between women. Oh, experts, husbands, spouses, employees, even children might all chime in on the discussion but it's between the women where the real tug-of-war takes place. An odd battle, with some of the participants switching sides in the midst of the contest. I'm not sure this book adds to the discussion for women, only stirs up old animosities. That wasn't Pearson's goal, I don't think. This is a romp through a cartoon life -- I actually let out a laugh here and there. So read it for the laughs -- one does well not to take it seriously. I'm reluctant to read the reviews on this site -- I can't bear to see the knives coming out, there's no good purpose. Perhaps a sequel titled \\"I Don't Know Why She Does It\\" might lead to a more  constructive discussion.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|sad to say. I had high hopes for it but it causes a cycle of crashing. there are no modifications to my EVO. It is running stack OS.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Looks good... would be a good substitute to the preloaded office app on Android but doesn't have integration with anything besides google account
B005NPBTQ6|4.0|I have been a Ryan Adams fan for about 9 years now, and I think this CD will become one of my favorites. It's definitely up there with Gold, Heartbreaker & Love is Hell.  It's not quite as country as some of his recent stuff, and to me, that's a good thing. Everything on here is slow or mid-tempo at best, so don't expect to rock out with this CD. But if you want something mellow, beautiful, poignant and smooth like butter--you won't be disappointed.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|I love Kelly, she is so talented. She will try different music styles at the same time staying true to her own sound. I appreciate this because I hate when an artist you like totally changes who they are as an artist. Kelly has grown as an artist but is still Kelly. This album has pop, rock, slow songs. I got the deluxe album from iTunes (sorry Amazon, your my go to for music but iTunes has 18 tracks). I have only listened to 14 songs so far, 1 track is ok the other 13 I like or love. That's a major accomplishment in the music industry today. Buy this album!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|this is a very good app i like the setup and the ease of how it works. the only thing i would like it to have is spell and gramer check. but overall i am very happy with it
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This film is done with the tender heart and soul of all involved in its making.  Its beauty is seen, heard, and felt on many levels.  You can read the synopsis anywhere, I'm just so taken with this film that I want to share the experience.  It was like seeing 'The Wizard of Oz' for the very first time to me.  Embrace it's simple yet complex wonder.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|As an avid music fan I am always stunned to hear a person \\"bash\\" a band like Coldplay. Chris Martin ranks just as high as Jagger/Lennon in my book.   As for the album, it is an instant classic. It incorporates all that is great about modern electronic/pop/rock/MDMA-induced greatness. Wonderful songs from start to finish. My rankings for their work:  1)Parachutes  2)A Rush of Blood to the Head  3)Mylo  4)X+Y  5)Viva  Enjoy it!
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I was disappointed with these headphones when I first got them two months ago, because I had to turn the volume way up, and I was not very impressed with the quality of the sound. Then I went back to read the reviews, many emphasized K702 would need an amplifier in order to have enough power to drive the headphones, so I ordered a NuForce uDAC-2. Now the volume control at half is plenty and clear, together they created such beautiful result, way beyond my expectation. I also wonder whether it has something to do with the very subtle yet significant effects out of \\"break in\\"?  I mainly listen to classical music. First I was impressed with the clarity, and when I heard the nuances in the music which I didn't realize I missed before, I was won over. The soundstage was wide and open, and it did feel like coming from outside the headphones, extremely spacious. The bass was sufficient for my taste. When I listened to Jean-Guihen Queyras play Bach Cello Suites, it was simply magnificent, totally natural and no distortion. Did I mention how soft the ear pads are and how comfortable wearing this design? I feel my music listening is raised to another level.
B0055SJVPW|5.0|This was a movie where I couldn't stop thinking about what was right and what was wrong. I'm very apprehensive when I see a movie or read a book that involves cheating. On one hand, I was cheering for Dex (Colin Egglesfield) and Rachel (Ginnifer Goodwin) because I loved the idea of the shy and quiet friend getting the guy at the end. On the other hand, I was fighting with myself because even if they were perfect for each other, I couldn't stop thinking in what they were doing to Darcy (even if she deserved it sometimes).   This is a movie that keeps you thinking on how far a person would go to find their own happiness. Their situation felt real and I was very surprised to see that they gave us a happy ending where you felt right and satisfied with the outcome.   The cast was perfect!!! I loved everyone of the characters. The chemistry between the love triangle felt authentic and real. The story and relationship of Dex and Rachel was so sweet that you couln't stop rooting for them.  I loved Ethan's character (John Krasinski), he felt like the best friend any girl would ask for. He wasn't afraid to say what was on his mind to Rachel, even if she liked it or not.   This definitely became one of my favorite movies, It was real, honest, funny and romantic. It definitely leaves you thinking if you were in Rachel and Dex's place, what would you do?
0393064476|4.0|I have read the Greenblatt book, and I was a little surprised that he did not mention a rather interesting treatment of Lucretius, the atomists and the swerve done in 1840/41, which was the doctoral thesis by the young Karl Marx. The title was entitled \\"On the Difference between the Philosophy of Nature of Democritus and Epicurus,\\" and the first chapter deals with \\"The Declination of the Atom from the Straight Line.\\" In the standard edition of the works of Marx and Engels published in 1985 by the Institute for Marxism and Leninism of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of the German Democratic Republic (Dietz Verlag, East Berlin), it is in vol. 40.      Ahead of the actual thesis is a collection of Marx's notes from Lucretius made in Latin, as well as extensive notes from various sources in Greek.    I am no professional Marx scholar, but the text is like the best in Marx's journalism, which is fresh and often entertaining.  The notes are extremely detailed to squeeze out the differences between Democritus and Epicurus, as well as Lucretius.  The edition translates all the \\"foreign language\\" references into German, and it is a good way to catch up on what was known of the atomists in the first half of the nineteenth century.  The link to the atheists and socialists of the time is implied but not made too dramatically clear.    I picked this volume up when the communist bookshops of West Germany were holding their \\"end-of-regime sales\\" in 1989/90. I found it an extremely interesting supplement to what Greenblatt has to say.  Steven Rowan, Professor of History, University of Missouri-St. Louis
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This looked like a great app but when I had all it on all my devices it would not quit searching and updating ALL the time... It was so bad on my Blackberry that it took me half an hour to uninstall it because it kept running and stopping anything else from working. I was not impressed... I took the app off my Blackberry and after I got through being 'p**sed off' I tried to use the app again using just my PC, Laptop, and Thrive Tablet.  It works great!!! It is so easy to transfer webpages, photos, blog entries ETC. to all my devices that it has saved me a lot of time.  I set all the apps to sync only when I ask them to and that has stopped the constant searching that it does.  I will be putting it back on my Blackberry, but as of right now with my Thrive Tablet I don't need it on my Blackberry too.  The only other thing that I'm a bit miffed about is that there is no 'manual' and 'Evernote for Dummies' won't be out until the end of January.  I would love to know how to do more with my Evernote but I guess I'll wait for my 'Dummies' book, which I've already pre-ordered from Amazon.  Definitely deserves the upgrade to 5 stars now.  PS if there was a manual or pamphlet of some sort to let you know how to set the sync at least this would not have been a problem at all...No where on the start up pages did I see anything on how to set the sync...

B0056BU3I2|5.0|This version of the Fast and Furious was by far one of the best in the series!  Tons of action and excitement, along with loads of heart pounding burnouts.<br /><br />I enjoyed the interactive features along with the ability to load onto my iPad to watch the video on the road.  The Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital combo was worked perfectly and I have already watched the movie at least 4 times from start to finish.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to complete the series.  You will not be disappointed with the fast cars and fast actions of Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, and Paul Walker!  When you finish watching the movie you will be looking to add some NOS to your AMC Gremlin or Pacer!  Imagine a fish bowl with NOS - Sweet!

0446547654|1.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and once I heard about this book I preordered it and got it ASAP. I won't spoil anything about the book but I will say its not his best work... I was disappointed a little. I love everything hes wrote except this one. Hes becoming predictable and this didn't keep my interest by the end. I kept putting it down and focusing on another thing.<br /><br />I love his novels. I reread them over and over and over again. The Lucky One and The Guardian are truly my favorites ever. His novels used to be so amazing to me. But The Best of Me and even his newest novel The Longest Ride I am having an issue reading. I keep putting it down and walking away.<br /><br />I just need Mr. Sparks to make The Guardian into a movie and all will be forgiven.
1451648537|2.0|I have read other books by this author, most notably Einstein's biography, which I enjoyed much more than this book. While I am having a tough time separating the man from the book, I will try. Simply put, Jobs was a complete ass. I had trouble getting through the narrative, not because of any deficiencies in the style or content, but because I had trouble reading about such a self centered, narcissistic jerk. There is no question that Jobs was a genius at marketing and style, but the real brains behind Apple was the other Steve, the one who got screwed by Jobs when Jobs was working at Atari.His adoptive parents were sweet and wonderful, but he dissed them too. Anyone who shows up to \\"demand\\" a job barefoot and smelly is a fool. Sorry, but nothing about Jobs comes across as sincere. I appreciate the huge success of Apple. I am not sure if that success is because of Jobs, or in spite of him.   The book is fine, the subject matter is not.

0439023521|5.0|Beautifully written, completely captivating from the instant you turn the first page. I have recommended this book to several friends, and have never encountered someone who didn't love it. Susan Collins sure knows how to keep your attention, in this riveting dystopian tale of a girl's struggle to survive against all odds. True love and intrigue, Katniss struggles to determine who is on her side, trapped in a myriad of friends and foes. This book takes you to the breadth of human kindness, and delves into the darker side of human nature. The stakes are high when to lose means your certain death.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This series is never a dissapointment. Anyone who has an interest in the occult, mystery sagas, or enjoys two wonderfully handsome, adorable men running around killing things along with a slight gore element, will LOVE this series. Of course, the series also addresses the dicotomy of good versus evil in there most biblical primal forms. Great plot twists, although at times (if you're a fan of the series and know the character development in a little more detail) it was predictable. All in all SUPERNATURAL Season Six had one of the most suspenseful conclusions. I would put it right up there with Seasons 4 and 2 cliffhangers.
0399536108|4.0|I came across this book through Chris' inspiring blog, and it was exactly what I needed to read at that time. For anyone who needs words of encouragement to let them know that you can live your life the way YOU want to, this is the book for you. You might want to travel, start a business, move cross-country: or all three. Witty, engaging, self-deprecating, and generally just really interesting, without taking a tone of \\"you must do this\\" or \\"you can't do this\\". Go ahead and buy it, I hope you enjoy it and get that extra push to start living your life the way you want to, it is so rewarding.

0446547654|3.0|Is it safe to say that readers expect what's coming when reading Nicholas Sparks? Is he really becoming so predictable that the endings are no longer a surprise? If you've read Sparks before, there's the possibility that the ending of \\"The Best of Me\\" won't be much of a surprise. That really ticks me off a little, because I was hoping for something great. The story was pretty good, and the ending was kind of like, \\"Oh, no kidding? Where have I seen this before?\\" Hopefully without giving a lot away, \\"The Choice\\" comes to mind immediately.<br /><br />There wasn't a whole lot that Dawson and Amanda were supposed to have in common. She was expected to be a success, he was expected to be a con, and his family has a history of being a menace to society. After all, Dawson even lived up to the Cole family name, going to jail and serving his time, and disappearing from the community that saw him and his family's name as a threat. But to say the least, before the crap went down, everybody's expectations were just too bad. And Dawson and Amanda had something going on, whether people liked it or not.<br /><br />And while not a whole lot of people embraced or cherished what these two love-birds once had, there was a mutual friend who believed in the both of them. Wouldn't you know it? His death would bring these two back together for one last possible shot at what was supposed to be. That is, if present-day menaces don't interfere, then maybe there could be a happy ending.<br /><br />Am I really supposed to be impressed with the latest offering that Nicholas Sparks brings to the table? Of course, because he's the trash-talking romantic! He's already shown Hollywood how to bring a movie or two to the big screen. But I wasn't impressed. I was entertained, yes. But that's what a Sparks novel promises, even if it happens to be a cheap thrill. So, this year, you don't get anything new. You simply get the typical Nicholas Sparks package, and he gets to be a bestseller once again. The characters we grow to love have their friends with benefits, maybe a small favor or two. And if that's what you want, that's exactly what you'll get. Thanks, Nicky. Back up that bestseller label next time, buddy!ve their friends with benefits, maybe a small favor or two.

1423389387|4.0|I am torn about this book series.<br /><br />I loved -- LOVED -- The Name Of The Wind. I picked that book up when the various internet sources I monitor wouldn't stop talking about it, and boy were they right. It is sort of a cross between J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series (but, for adults), L.E. Modesitt's Magic of Recluse series (with all of the details on building things, and making things), and Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth Series (for the violence, death and destruction aspect of fantasy).<br /><br />--minor spoiler alert past this point for non-main plot points--<br /><br />And, see ... the Terry Goodkind aspect of it, is what is souring me on the series.  I would love to give this book 5 stars. But I just can't.  Things were going more or less well, until very near the end. At that point, Kvothe has picked up some serious fighting skills, and is on his way back to his most recent point of origin, when he encounters a group impersonating his people -- and they have kidnapped two teenaged girls, and are raping them daily as a group. He is offered \\"use\\" of the girls, as a fee for joining them.<br /><br />Kvothe kills every last one of them, and saves the girls.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, they needed a good killing. I am in favor of the death penalty for all rapists of any size, shape, color, nationality, culture or ethnicity. Preferably in the most painful way possible.<br /><br />The killing of the rapists isn't what I object to. What I object to is the alluding to rape. That was the same horrifying garbage in Goodkind's basically-slash fiction, that made me toss his book, and never look back.  To Rothfuss' credit, he never depicts the actual rape, and he doesn't depict it as sexy, or that the girls were in any way enjoying it -- as some authors sometimes do. He depicts it honestly, as the horrifying thing it is, and pulls no punches that these are two, young, innocent girls (about 15/16) who are being tortured by monsters.  There is no mercy or pity in me for rapists. The subject brings up a horrified rage in me like no other subject on earth.<br /><br />If there is anything in this world that horrifies me the most, it is rape and torture of females young and old. It makes me physically ill just to read about it in the mild format that Rothfuss presented the topic in.  I don't understand why Kvothe couldn't have happened across them right after they had kidnapped the girls, but they hadn't harmed them yet? It presents Kvothe with the same situation to be furious about, and the same two girls to rescue, and the same subhumans to exterminate, but it saves the girls from having to suffer. This is fantasy escapist literature. Emphasis on ESCAPIST. If I wanted horrifying stories, I would read the world news. Everyone knows there are monsters in the world, I don't feel any particular need to read about them in my escapist fantasy novels.<br /><br />I do not agree with the point of view some authors have that they need to shock their audience in order to get them to respect their work. If we all think back, we all remember plenty of books quite fondly from our childhood and teen years which didn't use shock value to sell themselves. J.K. Rowling is the most recent example of such an author who will present adult topics, but in a way that doesn't go out of its way to horrify the reader. There were also books like the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt adventures, etc. All of those (and countless others) present thrills and adventure, and even wonder and magic, but do so without using shock value, and/or horrifying the reader.<br /><br />The writing of Rothfuss' books is 5 star quality. His first book was very well done.  The overall story being told in these books is also spectacular. Even though I know Kvothe isn't going to die, and how he is going to end up (due to the way that the story is being told), that doesn't lessen my excitement for what happens next, nor temper my dread when he is in peril.The first book, The Name Of The Wind, was brutal -- but it wasn't horrifying. Kvothe was put through some SERIOUS trials, and he had to witness some hard things, but we get through it with him as we read along.  In this book, The Wise Man's Fear, I would say about 95% of it is similar to the tone of the first book. It is just the one encounter with the rapists that soured it for me.  Earlier in the book when Kvothe was<br /><br />---MAJOR spoiler alert---<br /><br />learning about love and lust from none other than Felurian herself, and then getting her to aid him with a magical cloak, and knowledge that few mortals possessed, I was on the edge of my seat! Also, his handling of the bandits, the encounter with his old foe, the learning of the secret he learned while in the Fay realm (it is really hard to write this without just flat out giving things away), and his adventures back at the University all had me anxious to learn what happened next, and satisfied as a reader.<br /><br />---END major spoilers---<br /><br />So, if rape and rapists don't horrify you like they do me, then this is a 5 star book. If they do, skip chapters 30 through 34 (trust me), and it is a 4 star book. I really really wish that Rothfuss had NOT added those scenes, but he did, and that kind of ruined my enjoyment of the book. I will still probably get book 3, but I may have someone else read it for me first this time, and let me know what chapters to skip.ut through some SERIOUS trials, and he had to witness some hard things, but we get through it with him as we read along.

Only drawback is that the nightlight part feels like it was added into the design later so it doesn't fit the overall appeal of the Rainforest motif. Anyway I would recommend it and the baby loves it so hey, I am happy.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I had very mixed emotions re. this film.  I'm a huge Roddy fan, a huge fan of Kim Hunter and Charlton Heston and the original film, and of course I have all the old movies AND the TV series too, mostly because I couldn't get enough.  Of all the Apes characters, none (in my opinion) are as important as Caesar, who reinvents the future with the compassion and wisdom learned from the legacy left him by his humane parents Cornelius and Zira, and the mistakes of the original future (what then becomes the past), which ultimately causes the destruction of the world.<br /><br />In this version we have no original future.  Caesar is not the child of future apes at all, but rather the accidental result of an experimental drug.  In my view this premise is more realistic, but at the same time it takes away from the time loop the Apes saga was famous for & made it so unique.<br /><br />Impressive is the digitally created Caesar.  I was not disappointed, even though I expected to be.  What I did not like (at all) was his voice.  The voice was important. The original Caesar had only two ways to express himself--his eyes and voice.  They did justice to one (the eyes) but not the other. Also I find it quite telling (of Mr. Mcdowall's talent), that a human being in a crude (by today's standards) ape costume & mask can pull of more expression (eyes and voice) than the best efforts of digital invention we have today.  The Caesar in this film is breath-taking in his facial expressions and realism.  He too has the compassionate soul and keen intelligence.  But he is not the Caesar I love.  He does not have the passion or fire or rage or hope ringing in his voice and blazing in his eyes that made the very campy 1970's \\"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\\" a stand out--Caesar's powerful moving monolog at the very end of that film.  How can an actor in a mask produce so much emotion that even watching it today I find myself rewinding that old film and watching that scene again, marveling at the power.  Nothing tops that scene, or comes close to the depth of soul Roddy gives the original Caesar.  ALL the techno-digital whatever, and still it doesn't come close.  Tipping my hat to the (sadly) deceased Roddy.)<br /><br />It's still by far and away the best Apes movie since the original--I think so anyway.  The films that followed the original film, the sequels, are all favorites of mine, but campy, faded echoes of the original film.  Still my favorite scene of all the films has to be the dialog of Caesar standing on the steps with flames as the backdrop and the blazing passion pouring from his form--even through the primitive monkey suit.<br /><br />Proving, I think, that animated characters like we saw in Avatar and here and in Lord of the Rings, are wonderful to behold, and so realistic we can feel along with them and love them--cheer for them.  But they do not and never will have the human element that only a dynamic and talented living breathing actor can give.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this film--the subtitles/dialogue between Caesar and the Orangatan (sp?).  It would have been better with gestures--something.  Anything.  I found the subtitles distracting and the conversations between the two apes rather simplistic and stupid.<br /><br />What I loved about this film--the drop of blood at the very end when you think the film is over, but then you see the true downfall of humanity, the spread of a disease that apes are immune to, but swiftly kills humans.  This promises future sequels to a whole new spin/take on the original apes films. I'm looking forward.  I welcome these new films, and I'll savor every moment.  I just can't think about the original and fully enjoy...because nothing comes close to Kim Hunter's Zira or the fire and strength of a Caesar only Roddy Mcdowall could produce:<br /><br />\\"Where there is fire, there is smoke. And in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of Man's downfall - the day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble!

B001UV4XIS|4.0|I don't have the DVD yet but I am anxiously waiting.  I have to say I had a lot of hopes for Part II and likely that's why I was disappointed.  Twenty more minutes would have taken this movie from good to great.  All that build-up for the end battle and then when it finally comes, pttthhh! it's over.  What happened to the big show down taking place in front of the whole school?  I'm sorry but for the climax of the film the death of our two most hated baddies was a huge disappointment for me.  Honestly, don't blink or you'll miss it!<br /><br />It would have been nice to have seen how one of the twins was killed, or other main characters who suddenly we see are dead.  Killed by what?  And where was Hagrid's brother the half-giant?  We didn't see him in the battle at all.  Or Jinny...how she wanted to fight and people kept trying to stop her.  Nor did we see how Voldermort (sp?) uses his wand/power to flip Harry's limp body in the forest to incite laughs and jeers from his followers--which would have been painful to watch, but at the same time would have added to the darkness of this film.<br /><br />So much in the books was not in the film, so once again the film does not do the story justice.  However, this is a whole different medium...and with that in mind, they're wonderful and very visual films, still worth seeing many times as I do.  I never thought I'd get into the Potter series--until I did.  And the writing!  I have tried to read the Twilight books.  Couldn't do it.  Maybe she gets better with practice but the first book was very simplistic.  People compare that book series to this one--no comparison.  Few know how to world-build like J.K. Rowling. Or make characters so multi-faceted as many we've gotten to know & love here.<br /><br />What was great?  Pretty much everything else.  The old dragon was amazingly realistic.  At one point I could see the slide of muscle under his skin.  Very cool. Time to do the classic Pern series folks.  We have the stuff now to do that series justice.  Or at least the original first trilogy--I hated the later books.  Back to Potter--kudos for doing justice to the flashbacks revealing Snape as the devoted (to Lilly) and secret protector of Harry all these years.  For me reading that part of the story was very powerful and moving.  I was afraid the film would skim through what was a very important scene--and it did not.  It gave Snape the recognition he deserved--despite the fact the manner of his death was not quite right.<br /><br />But I give this film four stars because of all the things we didn't get to see, that I wanted to see.  So many things.  Read the last book.  Better yet, get the audio book--the narrator is excellent.  So much more cool stuff happens you never see in this film.Or at least the original first trilogy--I hated the later books.

A well-written, even-handed book about one of the most fascinating technological pioneers of our time.<br />2. A trustworthy and fair account of Jobs's life as a good biography should be.<br />3. Mr. Isaacson was hired by Jobs to do this thorough account of his life. For once, Jobs did not exert control of what was written. It's a real account of a riveting American life.<br />4. The author does a wonderful job of including many perspectives of Jobs. Including over forty interviews with the man himself. The good, the bad and the ugly.<br />5. Fascinating accounts, interesting tidbits, riveting technology and how it all came about.<br />6. Interesting childhood. From early childhood it was clear he wasn't accepting of authority. \\"Admixture of sensitivity and insensitivity, bristliness and detachment, that would mark him for the rest of his life\\". So much more...<br />7. Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs' main sidekick really shines in this book. Fundamental differences between them.<br />8. Great quotes from some of the best scientific minds and entrepreneurs that became maxims for Jobs: \\"The best way to predict the future is to invent it\\" and \\"People who are serious about software should make their own hardware\\". Quite telling.<br />9. I love the characters of Jobs's life. In particular the engineers and the working relationships. Jobs's unique management style to get the most out of his employees.<br />10. The attention to detail is one of the most interesting character traits of Jobs. So many amusing examples throughout book.<br />11. The battles between Gates and Jobs were epic. Many stories of their history illustrated. \\"His product comes with an interesting feature called incompatibility,\\" Gates. Now that's funny.<br />12. The chapter on Pixar is worth the price of the book. Absolutely loved it! Katzenburg vs Jobs.<br />13. All the iconic products are here: iMac, iPhone, iPod, iPad, etc...and how they came about. Makes me proud as an engineer!<br />14. Great engineering quotes, \\"Engineers are taught to make a decision analytically, but there are times when relying on gut or intuition is most indispensable.\\" Duly noted.<br />15. Jobs's love for music. His favorite bands. 32. The iPad. Awesome stuff!<br />16. Jobs's cancer, the tragedy. The author treats this section with the utmost of respect and care.<br />17. Great notes and sources.<br />18. Illustrations.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. Requires an investment of time but so well worth it.<br />2. Let's face it the book was worth it but some will cringe at the Kindle price.<br />3. No links.<br /><br />In summary, Steve Jobs will go down as one of the most influential technological icons of our time. His vision led to some of the most innovative, useful products ever assembled. His vision also led to some of the best animated movies ever, through Pixar. His ability to bring art and technology together was one of his greatest feats. The book is great because it captures the essence of Steve Jobs. I am so grateful that Mr. Jobs allowed Mr. Isaacson access into his life. In doing so, he gave us all a gift. Thank you Mr. Jobs.ecause it captures the essence of Steve Jobs. I am so grateful that Mr. Jobs allowed Mr. Isaacson access into his life. In doing so, he gave us all a gift. Thank you Mr. Jobs.

B0015DYIH2|3.0|I've read the series and found it entertaining. Breaking Dawn was a little sloppy compared to the first novels, but what's the fun of \\"reading\\" if your nit-picking.  I think the public, in general, took these books to seriously.
B00533Y0LE|5.0|This is a one of a kind CD.  Excellent choice of songs, representative music and phenomenal singer.  Such a  bright future awaits him!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I won't give this app 5 stars simply because I haven't tried other apps to compare it to, but I can guarantee that it is great. I have been waiting for an app like this to be the FAOTD because like many other Android users, I don't pay for apps and this is the only one I really needed. I have already used it to create a couple word and excel documents and I am highly pleased. Still have to see how it does on power point though.
630542845X|5.0|While there are several movies I consider to be my favorites, this movie, POWDER, has risen to (and stayed at!) the top of my list for years now.  In fact, the more I watch this movie, the more deeply it affects me.  \\"Powder\\" is the main character's nickname, due to his albinism.  But \\"Powder\\" is sooooo much more than his condition.....  He is extremely intelligent, and extraordinarily sensitive.  Of course, as with almost all those who are \\"different\\"---he is not understood, and therefore--subject to cruelty by others.  As the movie unfolds, one will see---and hopefully come to LOVE and RESPECT---all of \\"Powder's\\" incredible gifts.  I, for one, wish that \\"Powder\\" were a real person.....we would become INSTANT friends, because of who he is.....and especially, we would share our deep and powerful love for ANIMALS!!!  As I've said, this movie has touched me so deeply.....even just hearing the movie's musical score, reduces me to tears every time.  \\"Powder\\", like my sister, Eva---believed that God is in EVERYONE, and in EVERY LIVING THING......  Perhaps if we all TRULY understood this, we would treat eachother sooooo much better than we do!  Incredibly powerful movie---I highly recommend it!!!
0399536108|5.0|Loved it = easily digestible + humorous + challenging + motivational + practical + re-framing. Referring to some of the more critical reviews (the few of them there are) I have no idea how many of Chris' ideas are original, but the ideas and messages in the book are presented in a hugely thought provoking, entertaining, inspiring and uplifting way. For me. And for the others I know who've read it. As Chris says, nothing is for everyone; but I think this book is for many. Thank you Chris
6305291446|3.0|John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" is a solid and creative classic that stole many ideas and techniques (such as camera angle = killers' point of view) from Bob Clark's masterpiece, \\"Black Christmas\\".  Halloween 2 was a barely decent movie followed by lousy sequels (that weren't really sequels at all).  Halloween H20 received positive and strong reviews seemingly because fans were so grateful and relieved that after 20 years . . . there was finally a \\"Halloween\\" titled flick that had some resemblance to the original.  H20 is a slightly above average horror movie with an interesting premise and a some humor mostly by casting Janet Leigh.  No doubt H20 would have been greatly enhanced if John Carpenter had directed.  Here's some of why this film didn't cut the mustard:  The absence of logic is insulting to the intelligent viewer:  Laurie Strode supposedly faked her death 20 years ago and has now assumed the alias of Keri Tate in order to hide herself from her brother.  This makes for a fairly implausible script.    Characters are (extremely) much less interesting than the original.  Suspense scenes do not build enough and are therefore less than stellar.  Some scenes such as when the keys dropped were downright silly and annoying.  Decapitation scene simply didn't look real.  The soundtrack is disappointing and doesn't really help the movie.   Michael's mask and eyes were less scary than earlier movies.  Michael could have been killed by repeatedly bashing in his head with a rock.  Instead the young lady just gives him one quick crack to the noggin and runs.
0143119788|3.0|I found this book to be too dry - while I wasn't looking for too much action, there still could've been more in the way of tense or engaging moments. It took me a little while to get into this book because of all the British expressions/nuances and spy jargon used; however, once I got more accustomed to that I did enjoy the story and characters to some degree. The main character - George Smiley, a retired spy - was sketched out better than any of the others and was my favorite. There were many other spies from Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries with interconnecting relationships which became a bit confusing at times. The main plot concerned the question of whether or not there was a Russian mole inside the Circus (London's headquarters for MI6). A former field agent, Ricki Tarr, comes to Smiley and others with a story of how he encountered some Soviet agents overseas. Many are skeptical until Smiley delves more deeply into \\"Testify\\", the operation which lead to the dismissal of himself and Control who was the head, as well as undercover agent Jim Prideaux being shot in the back and captured.<br /><br />The portions of the book revealing Jim Prideaux's life teaching at a private school and his interactions with the students were rather entertaining. Seeing Jim through the eyes of students was a good contrast to the heavy intrigue of the rest. I think if I had been more accustomed to the spy jargon used - lamplighters, scalphunters, etc. - I might've enjoyed the book a bit more but I still would've found it lacking. While there was plenty of intrigue and investigations throughout, there were few, if any, really tense moments and little action. The ending felt like a foregone conclusion. The past detailing Control's downfall was interesting although it might've been better with additional dialogue with Control or more background for his character. Besides Smiley and Prideaux, none of the other characters really struck a chord with me.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great Movie - the best along with Iron Man of the bunch... Wasn't big on Thor.  But this movie is really entertaining and love the story line.  Very happy with quality and price of this BluRay - thanks Amazon!!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This package is able to open password protected documents from Microsoft Office 2010. Docs to go as of this writing only supports up to 2007. I use Office 2010, wish I never spent the money on Docs to Go...they are perpetually behind

B003UESJHO|5.0|I chose to order The Fighter on DVD through Amazon because of availability, great prices and the arrival time is normally quick. All were true with this order. The movie was in new condition and arrived within 5 days. I saw the movie in the theater so I already knew I loved it. I would order everything from amazon if I could.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I use this from my AppleTV optical out (Toslink) to convert to RCA/Phono L & R.  This works perfectly!  Build construction is great.  Unit feels solid and it just looks cool.<br /><br />My Setup: HDMI out from AppleTV to DVI (no audio).  HP Monitor w/ speaker bar only has a stero phone plug. I also purchased \\"Cables To Go 40424 Stereo F/M RCA Y-Cable (6 Inches, Black)\\" with this to limit the adapters to make my setup work: [[ASIN:B001B8QUS6 Cables To Go 40424 Stereo F/M RCA Y-Cable (6 Inches, Black)]] (from D3)<br /><br />Also good to know,...I didn't have space for a 3rd power plug so I ditched the power plug that came with the D3 and used a standard USB cable from the FiiO D3 to a USB plug on my monitor.  It works great and I haven't had any issues with this setup. Used this USB cable: [[ASIN:B000067RVL Cables To Go 27005 USB 2.0 A to Mini-B Cable, Black (2 Meter/6.56 Feet)]]<br /><br />The only issue to be aware of is that my setup does not allow me to play content with HDCP (content protection becaue I'm converting from HDMI to DVI).  Netflix on AppleTV doesn't really work due to this. Not an issue for me as I don't find nextflix streaming selection all that good.  Amazon Prime is much better :) Now if I can get Amazon Prime stream for my AppleTV.<br /><br />One other review mentioned issus with noise in his car?  This is most likely not an issue with the D3, and probably an issue with noise/interference from his car/components.  I've had issues like this with past car equipment and fixed using a ground loop noise filter or similar filter depending on the application.<br /><br />I wish I could rate this item higher then 5 stars!
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|If only the Amazonian gods would allow a review to accumulate a negative amount of stars, but alas, a single star must suffice.   Where to begin?   Imagine a group of people who are what weird, artsy, socially-awkward pseudo-intellectuals are to normal people, then imagine a group of people who are too wierd and too artsy for even your typical weird, artsy, socially-awkward pseudo-intellectual.  Still with me?  Now imagine that group of people made a movie - that movie would be Tree of Life.   This is the kind of movie that two people could watch at the same time and at the end completely disagree about what the movie was even about. You could literally write the entire dialog on a diner napkin and still have enough room to wipe yourself clean after eating BBQ rips without smudging the ink.   You average scene is either awkward silences between characters, or an outer-space/dinosaur/biology screensaver, depending on where you wake up in the movie.   Some have compared this movie to \\"A River Runs through It,\\" but at least that movie had some kind of deeper meaning or at the very least an underlying plot and some effort put into it.   Instead, this movie is a fecal finger-painting of cinematography that would better entertain you as a beer coaster than as a DVD. Oh, and the previews were infinitely more entertaining than the movie.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|So far as a casual user i cab find nothing wrong with this app. It does was it says and there hasnt been a file that it supports that i have had any trouble with. Not sure what some of the others are saying they are having a problem with, as with any app if you push the limts and look for the bugs you WILL find them. For the average joe such as myself the ability to view power point and pdf files is enough for me. The fact that i can view and edit .doc an .exl files is a huge bonus and on amazons faotd the price cant be beat. One of the most useful apps i have got from faotd. Keep it up amazon it can only get better.
0811879631|4.0|If you have the regular 'Art of' books for each film, there is not a lot of new content here. Also there is not much commentary from Pixarians or otherwise. Still, it is just what is says it is, the COMPLETE color scripts... so they're all in there for every film and short, in their entirety, and they're absolutely gorgeous. Also, there is a comprehensive section containing 'world' art, which is basically environmental concept sketches.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you don't have the full Art Of (film) series, get those first because they cover each film in detail with a lot of great art and first-hand commentary. If you already have all those books (or at least the ones you're interested) and you would like to re-visit all the films and shorts in a new and abstract way then you cannot go wrong with this comprehensive volume.
0399536108|5.0|This book should be required reading for all who are tired  of the negative attitude wafting through the world today.  I stumbled across the book accidently knowing nothing about  Chris or his site and devoured it twice. It's message is  inspiring- especially in this society of dream killers. There  are great ideas to begin your own journey but what I like  most about this book is Chris' delivery of his message.  Sometimes hearing something you already know in a new  way is all it takes to knock you out of your stuck mentallity  and see life from a new angle. This book is targeted at all  society, not just young people but all people looking for more  meaning from their time on this big rock
0393324818|3.0|The author felt the need to use the F-bomb way too often, once per page in some sections. Not to mention the S-word. If you love the f-bomb and other profanities, no worries, I'm just warning readers who prefer not to read such things or give it as gifts.<br /><br />Other than that, this book was good, but not great. I'm a big baseball fan, but there was too much detail about trading and stats even for me. It could have been at least 100 pages shorter without leaving any important info out. This is one of those rare cases where I'd say the movie is definitely better. The fictionalized version is just a lot more fun and interesting because it doesn't feel like someone is trying to sell you on fact that aren't really facts.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|This album is powerful...energetic...forceful...tough...unyielding....vigorous...and very well-made; so yes, STRONGER is the perfect title for Kelly Clarkson's new album. In my opinion, there's no top 40 pop artist that makes albums this airtight; except this brilliant singer with an ear for a good tune. The vocals are insane, the production is spot on. I'm not one who cares about the Grammys, but I'm sure Ms. Clarkson has a date with them. There are so many highlights I wouldn't know where to begin. If you like the last few KC albums, you will love this one too. The standard edition of STRONGER is a winner, but the deluxe edition is a no brainer for the true fan. By the way, if you buy the deluxe edition from Kelly's website, you can get a six song bonus EP that's very much worth it. Trust me KC fans.<br /><br />Finally, some modern top 40 pop this old rocker can enjoy. Cheers!
B005HS00NW|3.0|While starting off incredibly strong, the album succumbs to decency. Many of the songs seem to be unfinished, at a length of 1-2 minutes. After my initial listen through the entire album, I find myself skipping past these short songs to get to the next completely developed track. I think this is a shame because these short little snippet songs I really find myself loving and then they abruptly end. Truly a wasted effort for so-called \\"double album.\\" What we have here is basically a single-disc album with some filler tracks that go nowhere to pump up the track list. It's not all doom and gloom though--as a whole, the album is a good one. But it could have easily been something truly great if these short songs were fleshed-out and developed into the awesome songs they could be.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|The Final Concert from a-ha is truly a gift for their fans.<br />I'll echo the sentiments of others and say this is a must have<br />for anyone who is a fan of a-ha, even if you only listened to their<br />singles.<br />The Final Concert is masterfully arranged and is nothing short<br />of spectacular in blu-ray.<br />In this emotional performance, it is clearly seen that the band gives<br />their all to the fans.<br />Thank you a-ha for all of the years of wonderful music!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it is a nice follow-up of the story in the Hunger Games. Many things set up in the first book fall into place in this second book, with lots of great moments, of a-ha! moments, or fear for the characters' lives moments. Read it!
1451648537|5.0|OK, so I'm posting this part 1 simply from a book  the actual book) NOT the content of. I'm VERY VERY disappointed in AMAZON on this book in that it was dumped into a box un protected. The cover is wrinkled, why wouldn't you SHRINK wrap this book, come on it's Steve Jobs, one of the most important people of his time, and you ship his book like a .99cent newspaper article. Simply pathetic.<br /><br />Now the read, it's great so far, can you say Little Blue Box...  I love it so far.<br /><br />5 stars to the author<br /><br />-5 stars to publisher and amazon for packaging this so horrible !
B004VSTP4Y|1.0|After Shiver and Linger,and quite a lot of wait, I was glad to finally be able to read Forever, the last of the Wolves of Mercy Fall series by Maggie Stiefvater.<br /><br />The story is very nice, although sometimes you really have to want to read forward because it is not very fast-paced, and it's easy to lose momentum. The ending to Forever was crappy, a hangover, almost nothing between Sam and Grace is resolved, so I'm giving it only one star, unless the author wakes up and gives us a last book that resolves everything.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Been hoping for these to come to Blu-Ray for a while now and I am happy with what they delivered. The movies themselves look great, and the extra features are fantastic. For the price, you can't beat it for what you get.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A mash-up between Running Man and Battle Royale, with a twist. This book was great, I loved the male protagonist, although Katniss is a bit bland and kind of a pushover. I highly recommend it, the story is great and compelling!
0062112430|5.0|I absolutely love Lauren Oliver's writing.  Her way of putting words together is truly amazing.  If I'd been reading this as a print book, it would have been full of post-its marking all the passages I wanted to jot down for later inspiration; as it is I had four different MP3 bookmarks in the audio version, three of which marked passages I wanted to come back to later.  I would have marked more, but my player can only hold ten and my daughter was using some so I had to be selective.<br /><br />I had a hard time shutting this book off to do measely little things like shower, go to bed, and work--I just wanted to keep listening.  That's not to say there weren't any flaws; there were--it's never really explained just WHY the United States had decided that amor deliria nervosa was the cause of all their problems or how they initially got people to go along with it (explained in later books maybe?  On the other hand, why would a seventeen-year-old narrator have this information anyway?)--but the herd mentality and need to feel safe that has developed by the time of the novel was, I felt, pretty believeable.  Lena's not a particularly strong or brave person--she spends much of the novel afraid and unsure, just waiting to be cured to make her feel safe for once--but I felt that made her much easier to relate to.  It does get rather depressing to always read about perfect, beautiful people who are able to do amazingly brave things and are always strong...one starts to feel a bit inadequate.  She never turns into a ravishing beauty, but her relationship with Alex makes her feel beautiful, and that's even better.  Most of the brave things she does are because another character whom she cares about gives her the strength to do them.  She truly is a nothing special girl, unlike in many novels (and movies) where the awkward-looking protagonist suddenly is transformed into Anne Hathaway's twin.<br /><br />I loved the little snippets and exerpts at the beginning of each chapter--they really gave a peek into what living in that universe must have been like.  The fact that New Hampshire's license plate slogan made the Comprehensive Compilation of Dangerous Words and Ideas just cracked me up.  Another of my favorite parts was when Lena was sneaking out of her aunt's house for the first time and suddenly understood how the narrator of Poe's \\"Tell-Tale Heart\\" must have felt (and then thought to herself that Poe must have snuck out of the house a lot as a teenager--too funny!).  I will be looking forward to the second in the series when it comes out, though to be honest, I think I'd really be okay if things just stayed as they ended with this one--even though that is totally unlike me.  Hopefully the next book can live up to the story as it continued in my imagination--no pressure, Lauren Oliver.  ;-)peek into what living in that universe must have been like.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This series has been great and the awful ending is just along the lines of this downward spiralling towards one's own inferno. This book was brilliant and heartbreaking. Please read it!
0375507256|5.0|Very simply, the best novel I have read in many years and probably the best modern novel I have ever read.  It took a while to understand the structure and layers of the stories, but once I got into it, I couldn't stop reading.  When I was done, I found myself returning to the stories in my mind and replaying them over and over to better comprehend the meanings and relationships.  This book is required reading for any serious student of literature.

This OfficeSuite Pro 5 is great! Works good on my  D2G. I'm soo happy its the FAotD... the only complaint I have is that you can't edit PowerPoint documents. I might want to change a couple words around before the big presentation, add a picture, or something else  small. But, you can just view PowerPoints.  If it had the editing PP feature, I'd give it a 5, but a 4 star review is still a way useful application. Especially, since it was Free today!  I feel redeemed from  the other $15 MS Office compatible application that I wasted my money on... Thanks Amazon for a quality Free application today!

0007229674|5.0|Vintage Gordon Ramsey. If you wanna know what motivates and drives this man to be the best, read this book. After watching Hell's Kitchen and becoming a fan of Kitchen Nightmares UK (The US edition is terrible, but that's for another review), I needed to understand where he was coming from. His style of management is definitely not for the faint of heart and his (motivational?) methods cross the boundaries of verbal abuse, but it's A. Not like it blindsides you, and B. is a direct product of his childhood and early career. Not excusing the man, I'm just sayin'...there is a method to his madness. He pulls no punches and if you're looking for a PG-rated version of Ramsay, you won't find it here. You'll hate his father, feel sorry for his mother, want to smack his mentor, Marco Pierre White, find yourself irritated at his brother, and maybe even cut the guy some slack when you think he's gone overboard. To be fair, I did search the internet for Marco's insights on Gordon Ramsay and found only jealousy. The man criticizes GR for abandoning the art of cooking to make tv shows then tries to do the same thing, only to fail miserably. I thought about purchasing Marco's own autobiography, but found his various interviews with different food critics to be glimpses into the mind of a self-delusional individual. Brilliant cook, but nothing else. I'll stick with Gordon Ramsay's version.   You don't like GR. You either love him or you hate his guts. The book is obviously not for the latter individual, but will end up a fantastic read for the former. Highly recommended.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|When I was a kid in the 60's, Batman, Spiderman, and Captain America were my 3 favorite superheroes, and remain so to this day.  No need to rehash the other great reviews, but IMO, what they got SO RIGHT here was the CHARACTER of Steve Rogers BEFORE he becomes Captain America.  Just as Batman Begins had us totally invested in Bruce Wayne BEFORE he ever donned the cape and cowl, Marvel works the same type of magic with Steve Rogers & THAT (along with stellar performances by ALL the supporting cast) is what makes this a truly great film.  After suffering through the badly done CA movies of the past, it is a dream fulfilled to see the character brought to life so fantastically By Chris Evans & Joe Johnston.  And the Red Skull--OMG--Incredible makeup & Hugo Weaving shines as always to make the character come across as one of the premiere villains of the Marvel Universe.  Finally--watch the deleted ending scene to see how they really SHOULD have ended the movie--THAT was my only gripe--the truncated ending in the theatrical version.  So, to sum up--FINALLY a GREAT, FUN & FAITHFUL rendition of Captain America.  Bring on the AVENGERS!  It's time to ASSEMBLE!

B003EPPEP4|3.0|There is no question that this girl has talent and boy can she sing!.  But, the choice of songs here is a poor one for her.  Technically, she does them very well.  However, listening to them there's no question that her voice, good as it is, is that of a very young girl.  For a number of these songs, they really need a more mature voice to really capture their flavor.  Her voice distracts from the songs, not because she isn't doing them well, but because you can't believe that a voice that young would have had the time and experience to really have lived what these songs are about, which distracts from their atmosphere.  As a result, the impression is given that these particular are being performed as part of a show or recital rather than expressions of life.    Again, not slamming her talent or her other work, just saying that this album would have had a lot more power and credibility if she had recorded them with a voice that sounded like they could have happened to her.  Say, about 6-10 years from now.  Give a listen to Hilary Kole or Sophie Milman to see what I mean
B004I8WD7S|4.0|The item is as described, and works fine.  Unfortunately the film is the same one we typically see with all the bubble issues.  On the plus side, it does come with a \\"squeegee\\" to help iron some of them out, but it doesn't get rid of the small ones around the edge very well.  They just keep coming back.  And then when you put the phone into the case, it, pulls up on the film and you got more bubbles.  For that reason, I dont recommend it for the film, but a good practical case for the price.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I just thought I would add my voice to the growing disgruntled fan base who are tired of shoddy remakes and the lack of an option to view the original versions. Lucasfilm, why ignore your fan base, and refuse to cash in on a surefire hit by DOING THINGS THE RIGHT WAY, not cutting corners on remastering, and giving us the chance to see the original movies as they we remember them?
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This is truly an awesome app. I believe I can finally get the performance from my galaxy tab I've been looking for. I'm still getting through some of the features but find great ease of use for this app.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Being desperate, I ordered this device as well as the other one costing more money, knowing I could use both eventually. I tried both devices on several of my tv's and found they both worked well. The DAC had more features, except for one, which I found the most useful on the Fiio. That was the power light and another light that showed the signal had locked on. I had a bad plug on a power strip and the Fiio let me know that it was not on.<br />The price can't be beat. The size is  a much smaller foot print than the Dac, which may or may not be an advantage. (possible heat build up),<br />One last thing, as mentioned by another reviewer, but needs to be mentioned again. If it is not working, make sure your T.V. audio is set to pcm and not dolby.
1451648537|4.0|People why are you rating Steve Jobs the person instead of the book? This is a book review not a review of what you think of the person.      I enjoyed the book. I would agree with others that the book was cheaply made though. I would also suggest the book Icon for more on Steve.  Cheers

I just wanted the first DVD, or a new set, but it was his only one.  It was sealed so it had to be originally packaged with that DVD missing.

B005D0RDIE|5.0|Saw this concert film in its theatrical release on October 26, 2011.<br /><br />For guys pushing 60, the boys in Rush have the enthusiasm and stage energy of guys half their age.  Their enthusiasm is infectious, with the band and the audience feeding off each other.<br /><br />This is a remarkably high-energy show, and the numerous cuts to the crowd show fans of all ages obviously having a wonderful time (as evidenced by the near-constant smiles on their faces).  For such a large arena show, it feels surprisingly intimate.<br /><br />The band mines the depths of their extensive catalog with the setlist, including the title track from the album \\"Presto\\", and pull a suprising amount of energy out of \\"Marathon\\" from the album \\"Power Windows\\".  I don't think they did any songs from \\"Grace Under Pressure\\", but IIRC they may have hit almost every album from \\"2112\\" forward, plus \\"Working Man\\" as the final encore.<br /><br />In both the concept videos and the live show the band plays around with the arrangements of a few of their best-known songs:  listen up for brief polka, disco, and country arrangements of \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", among other treats.<br /><br />The lighting rig above the stage resembled spider legs at times.  It looked expensive and elaborate, but for all its mobility I didn't notice a marked visual impact on the stage or show itself.<br /><br />The cameras capture the three performers having a great time playing jovially alongside each other, and even a few instances where they appear to engage individual members of the audience for a moment and a laugh.  I can't recall ever seeing another band enjoy their time onstage together as much as Rush does, and they've been at it for nearly 40 years (current line-up).<br /><br />Neil's drum solo occurs about midway through the second half of the show, and despite some slight inconsistency in the rhythm of his hi-hats (an observation, not a criticism) he delivers on the promise of his reputation as one of rock's finest drummers.  He once again ends with a nod to the Big Band era.<br /><br />Geddy's bass work still impresses:  his improvisational \\"fills\\" sound intricate and effortless at the same time.  Too bad his vocals get a little buried in the sound mix (unless that was due to limitations of the movie theater's sound system).<br /><br />With the concept videos, the concert runs darn close to 3 hours -- but never drags for even a moment.  The DVD and Blu-ray feature some additional concept video footage and some archival concert footage from the 1970's.<br /><br />Highly recommended viewing, even if you can't watch it on a 30 foot-high screen like I did.Geddy's bass work still impresses:  his improvisational \\"fills\\" sound intricate and effortless at the same time.

B004VF68AQ|3.0|I saw Janes Addiction live in lisbon this summer, for the very first time. It was a short, but great show. They played the first single from The Great Escape Artist [TGEA], \\"End of the Lies\\", and it sounded great, which gave me high expectations to the album.  Last week i bought TGEA, and i´ve been listening to it everyday, since then. But no matter how hard i try, i can´t stop feeling dissapointed about it. Its not a awful album, but its very overproduced and calculated. Like a 50 years old, single mom, trying to look younger and cool, with her body full of silicone and botox, this is how i see Jane on TGEA. There´s no addiction on it.  The album is too short (just 39 minutes), and every song is mid-tempo, with spacey intros, radio-friendly chorus, and premature outros. In some tracks, when things are getting interesting, when it seems like they're ready to explode into some higher groove, they suddenly stop. Just like that. Dont expect many solos from Dave Navarro or Stephen Perkins, and believe me, Perry Farrell perfomance its average. Including all Porno for Pyros, Satellite Party and solo stuff, this is the worst singing i ever heard from Perry.  \\"Irresisteble Force\\" might be the best song here, \\"End of the Lies\\", \\"Curiosity Kills\\" and \\"Broken People\\" are good songs too, but the other ones are just filler.  I was not expecting another masterpiece like Nothing Shocking or Ritual de lo Habitual, but ill wait for their next album, at least to be better than strays, which isn´t the case over here.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this series. It kept me enthralled at every page. I couldn't wait to see what Katniss's next move would be.. and.. of course who would she chose?! Don't worry no spoilers here, but I will tell you that she was one of the most courageous people I have ever read about. For those of you saying, \\"people just told her what to do she didn't have a mind of her own.\\" That's completely untrue, she turned events to her likings, she got in charge when she had to, and she said what was on her mind. I loved that about her. She was truly a people's choice and I love that she helped in every way she could to get things back in order. Those of you complaining about her, put yourself in her shoes. Would you have made all the tough calls she did? Or would you have cowered in a corner? I'm just saying- I LOVED every single book in the series! Those of you wondering if you should buy this book or not.. you should. I mean, have you not already read the other two books? Why stop now? Give it a chance! Yes, there are people who don't like this book, you may be one of them, but me on the other hand LOVED it. There were MANY unexpected turns. LIKE WHEN .. (I'm just playing I won't tell you what happened you have to read the book!) The books embodies what sacrifices have to be made in order to survive. Who her true friends are and the struggles that she has to go through to get some of her true friends back. Life is about this- struggles, heartache, loss, love, and friendship. Thanks to this author for such an excellent series!

0525423281|5.0|Perkins does it AGAIN! Ah, Lola and Cricket...A modern retelling of Pretty in Pink(but Duckie is chosen this time!)<br /><br />I'm not going to lie I had HIGH expectations...It even crossed my mind that Lola's was'nt as good as Anna. But then I was like, \\"hold up! why are you comparing?!\\" they're two different...every!Then I was like \\"yeah! Lola was just as awesome!\\"<br /><br />Mistakes were made and lessons were learned with Lola and Cricket. I'm so happy about the way things ended. It couldn't have been better. I have to admit Lola made me a little bit angry. Really, just a little bit because even I understood her anger towards Cricket. She felt like Cricket just left her high and dry...so I was like hmmm Cricket: good or bad? I thought Max was a good guy...but then he just turned into a total douche, but maybe he was already one. So...Cricket is a good guy! He's extremely nice, gentle, charming, understanding... x x x Is there really a guy like this? Like really. Perkins...well done. I am yet again swept away by your characters, story telling, and writing!<br /><br />...and yes, Anna and St Clair are in this one! I cannot wait for Isla and the Happily Ever After!<br />It's the final companion to Anna and the French Kiss and Lola and the Boy Next Door, dramatic sigh.I'm getting sad just thinking about it!<br /><br />Maybe I'll just read Anna and Lola all over again! If you haven't read these two books yet, then you should, STAT!
1400052181|4.0|This was a highly interesting read.  I admire the author, as well as her attempts to rescue Henrietta Lacks from obscurity and to redress some of the wrongs that her family had suffered.  It was a fascinating examination of a number of issues in scientific ethics.  I also respected that the author was trying to demonstrate the humanity of the Lacks' family.  A definite recommend.
0142419400|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss...[insert squee here]<br /><br />Loved this book, seriously READ IT! Stephanie Perkins is up there with my favorite contemporary(love story) authors: Simone Elkeles, Jennifer Echols , and Lauren Barnholdt.<br /><br />I need to fan myself because I just fall in love. Perkins writing is superb... I've read a lot of romance-ish/chick lit novels and none of them make me want to cry, smile, laugh all at the same time. I felt like Perkins understands what us girls go through! That's what makes Anna so relatable. I mean how many of you have liked a guy/girl you can't have? And the fact that Anna gets her knight in shining armor...puts a smile on my face. And Etienne St. Claire, I need to find a guy like him(Cricket Bell too). I don't know if it's the European Shrug or something, but he had me at \\"Bonjour\\". Perskin's characters are flawless, admirable and genuine.<br /><br />If your looking for an all around awesome book, then read Anna. I cannot stress it you you enough. You'd be goshing over for days!
0425242099|3.0|Let me just say that I LOVE Nalini's Psy-Changeling series.<br /><br />Her Psy-Changeling series is the ONLY series that I have bought - and kept. I'm reading JD Robb's EVE DALLAS series - but I haven't bought any of the books. I bought most of Suzanne Brockmann's SEAL series but eventually sold them on. I have NO intention of EVER selling on the Psy-Chaneling series - but I've only bought up to book 9.<br /><br />As there was no way on earth I was going to buy a hardback book to add to my series collection, I checked this one out of my local library. I'm really glad I did. Nalini is a fantastic writer (in my humble opinion) but this book was anti-climatic. I enjoyed the secondary love story, but the main romance, though fantastically written, didn't live up to expectation. Expectation, I might add, that was build up over the previous 9 books. I expected and wanted MORE.<br /><br />Dear reader of this review, I don't know how to explain what I felt and thought when I read this book. Sienna character was really well written. She came across as exactly the age she was. Hawke, to me, was more interesting in the previous books. There was a couple of times they nearly got intimate then something would happen and they had to abandon their intimate moment. This did get a bit irritating. But really, there wasn't much Hawke & Sienna time and no real romance time. The war arc moves along, which took up book space, and yeh I liked Lara & Walker but not to the detriment of have an interesting romance between H & S. Judd & Brenna didn't share their story with a secondary couple, infact none of the other main characters have. It boils down to the fact that I wanted, hoped for, EXPECTED Hawke & Sienna to be the main and only HEA focus - and they weren't, which made KOS a slightly disappointing read hence the 3 stars.<br /><br />I wont buy book 11, hopefully my local library will have it. If it's a 4 star read, I'll buy it when it comes out in paperback. If it's a 5 star read and needs KOS to keep the series moving along, I'll buy KOS (in paperback of course) which should be a cheap buy by then.<br /><br />KOS just did not live up to expectation. Instead of being a spectacular read like others in the series - it was just OK.<br /><br />If you've just come across this series, there is NO WAY you should start with this book - KOS. This is not a series that can be dipped in at random points. To extract the most enjoyment from this series you do need to start with Book 1 and work your way through. IT's worth it.<br /><br />5* Book 1 - Slave to Sensation - Lucas DR + Sasch Psy<br />3* Book 2 - Visions of Heat - Vaughn DR + Faith Psy<br />5* Book 3 - Caressed by Ice - Judd Psy + Brenna SD (very romantic)<br />2* Book 4 - Mine to Possess - Clay DR + Talin H - I could wax lyrical about how much I heartily disliked Talin.<br />4.5* Book 5 - Hostage to Pleasure - Dorian DR + Ashaya Psy - (very romantic)<br />4* Book 6 - Branded by Fire - Riley SD + Mercy DR<br />4* Book 7 - Blaze of Memory - Dev FP + Katya Psy<br />4* Book 8 - Bonds of Justice - Max H + Sophia Psy<br />3.5* Book 9 - Play of Passion - Drew SD + Indigo SD<br /><br />SD = SnowDancer - wolves<br />H  = Human<br />FP = Forgotten mixed race Psy<br />DR = DarkRiver - Cats, Leopards, Jaguar (hopefully Nalini will intro other 'cats' - Lions? Panthers? who knows?)

B0058UXHHK|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down, it was that good. It's not the type of book I am used to reading as it is more mystery than chick-lit, but it had enough humour, angst and relationship drama to keep me invested in not only the mystery but the characters. Rose was a great character - after spending 24 years a slave to her abusive mother, she had an amazing passion to make up for lost time, hence the 28 and a half wishes. Her relationship with her older sister Violet had me choked up several times and I related to it on a personal level. The love story between Rose and Joe had me on the edge of my seat, guessing along with Rose whether Joe was true-blue or just too good to be true. And I found myself trying to solve the mystery. The only thing about this novel that got on my nerves was the over-use of the phrase \\"crappy doodles.\\"
B004LROUNG|4.0|I have not read a Grisham novel in several years, and it has been well worth the wait. If you are a fan, you cannot afford to miss this one.  Two bumbling ambulance chasers, hook up with a young attorney who lacks court experience, and the story just keeps on building from there. To give anything more up, would be a disservice to your enjoyment.  Have fun with this quick read...I certainly did.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|After getting my tablet, I've spent a lot of time searching for a good office app. I've gotten Quickoffice, Documents to go, Olive Office, and Thinkfree. Sadly, each of the programs either had compatibility issues with some of my files or were missing features I normally depend on, like the comments tab for powerpoint presentations or tye ability to look at other sheets on excel files.This program seems to have it all, and I'm very impressed. The only feature I might add would be the ability to edit and bookmark pdfs. Other than that, this app is fantastic and definitely the closest thing I've found to Microsoft Office. Thank you Amazon for sharing this amazing app and props to the developers!

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|The writers for the film have done a good job at adapting the famous \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" novel written by Jane Austen, into a short 2-hour film (I say this in comparison to the 6+ hour BBC series). Needless to say, some of the original meaning and conversations are omitted or altered in the film, or placed in different settings/scenes in order to give audiences as much of the original and full meaning provided in the book. Overall, I think this is done quite well.   The Bennett household is a family of colourful characters, the most sensible of which are Lizzy and her sister Jane. Like any normal family, they are not exempt from their fair share of dramas - some of which, pose a threat to the happiness of Lizzy and her family's social-standing.   In Lizzy's initial encounter with Mr Darcy, she vows to \\"loathe him for all eternity\\", and yet as fate would have it, events lead their paths to cross time and time again, and both must overcome their pride and prejudices in order to find true felicity.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|I like Kevin Smith well enough but I'm not a fanboy. I always considered him a better writer than director and he's had a few stinkers (as have most directors) in his career. This is definitely not a stinker.  Here's the scoop. Three young men are lured, with the promise of sex, to a trailer. Instead of sex, they are drugged, captured and the soon to become fodder for the wrath of a whacked, cult-type preacher/ survivalist. Through a fluke, the ATF gets involved and the whole situation escalates to a Wacco style standoff.   There is no way to guess this is a Kevin Smith film at a glance. The plotting is more intricate and the directing is more fluid. I simply could not believe what I was seeing. I liked the way the story unfolded. I didn't at all find it forced. It was also very good at depicting the subtleties of the situation. Yes. Some of the church members were whacked, but when the doo-doo hit the fan others realized the gravity of the situation and wanted out. The ATF members were also a mixed bunch. Many were not quick to be all gung-ho due to the fact that young children were involved.   John Goodman, as the beleaguered ATF team leader, was outstanding. Michael Parks, as the head preacher, was equally as good. The young boys were all believable and many of the church members made my skin crawl. This is a horrible, but believable situation. It is not difficult to see how a situation like this can escalate and get out of control. Smith is beyond himself as a director here. He sets his shots up way better than I've seen in any of his other films. All the other production values were in line with the story. Nothing too elaborate, but nothing stripped down so you see the bones.  I'm very hesitant to give a movie 5 stars because I can (and have) gotten so involved in a film while watching it that I don't see it's weak points. That may be the case here but I'm giving it the big 5 anyway.

0307888681|4.0|It use to be that zombies were the stuff of grade B horror flicks. That's not so true anymore. Today zombies have somehow become mainstream. While mainstream they've still held that mostly campy feel to them. That's what makes this book different from most other zombie entertainment. Rather than try to be a horror story or campy it is instead presented as a serious drama and that's a large part of why this book works.   World War Z doesn't play down to the reader. It doesn't try to be quirky, humorous or a Stephen King wanna be. It sets out to create a story of a zombie invasion and how it effects the entire planet. It does so it such an excellent way that it comes across as very believable and actually makes the reader think. While it's unlikely I will ever have to try and survive a zombie outbreak I couldn't help while reading this wondering how I would have survived.   I think because of the way this book approaches the story it will appeal to more than just people who are into zombies. You don't have to be a fan of Dawn of the Dead or horror novels to enjoy it.

B005QPGHQU|3.0|I bought this as a fan of Evanescence's earlier work - Origins, Fallen, The Open Door.<br /><br />This feels like a handful of demo recordings that they decided to release without editing or cleanup - Amy's voice is lost in the muddle of background noise, and there is no sound balance or polish to any of the pieces. Unlike prior albums, none of the songs tell a story. Each track on this album comes across as angsty noise - something an angry teenager might blast to keep their parents out of their room. It makes decent background music or white noise for work, but I have no interest in sitting and actually actively LISTENING to the songs. I can't make out half of the lyrics because they are lost in the guitar thrashing and fuzzy sound balance. Most of the songs lack any distinct melody or vocal line. What lyrics I *can* make out are generic sound bytes of bad emo poetry. (Evanescence is not exactly known for their uplifting tone, but even mournful or angry songs on past albums told a story - this is just indiscriminate whining.)<br /><br />I rather wish I'd saved my money. I'm disappointed by this album.

1451648537|5.0|By the end of the book, you will feel like you know Steve like an old friend, maybe even know more about Steve than himself. You learn about his quirks, his obsession over simple, clean, minimal Zen-influenced design and self-image, his famous humiliating tempers, his manipulative and controlling negotiation tactics, his sensitive father and husband side...and much more.  I've admired his business accomplishments and his determination to exert all it takes to create what he deems a great intuitive and narrative product that are simple and accessible to young kids and elderly. But this book tells the uglier side of him underneath his charming public personality, his ego and how that influence Apple Corporation.

B005IZLPME|4.0|Apparently the studios who make the media are idiots. They always make DVDs and Blu-Ray discs with sound levels that are grossly inadequate. What do they want, the consumer to run out and buy a sound system for their lousy movies that in most cases are not worth buying or seeing.  Have a state of the art Asus 3D laptop from Amazon with powerful speakers that I can barely hear when viewing Blu-Ray media and DVDs for that matter in Windows 7. It is not the media players (that are all inadequate) but the discs and the makers of laptops and the laptops sound scheme.  Wearing 3D glasses and ear phones is a real hassle on a laptop. How stupid are these studios and computer makers and MicroSoft? The answer is completely stupid and greedy.  Wait,there is more. The same applies to the newer plasma/LED/LCD TVs too. The TV makers give/provide a lousy sound system with your brand new TV.  Have two brand new LG 3D TVs from Amazon. The LED model's sound scheme is preposterously inadequate. At maximum volume I can barely hear the movie or TV over my house fan that sits on the floor about four feet from the LG LED TV thst sits on the floor.  These movies do not have in your face 3D effects. Captain America is a damn good movie with piss poor sound volume and nothing really in your face in 3D. My LED LG 3D TV can not overcome the inadequate sound nor can my Asus 3D Blu-Ray laptop from Amazon.  No consumer should have to spend additional hundreds of dollars to amplify the sound on their 3D TV or any new TV so they can hear it. The same for a laptop.  Studios need in your face 3D or they are going to go belly up.  Me, I want swords, fists, hatchets, bullets, rattle snakes uncoiling in my face on the screen. If you can not duck in a 3D movie then it ain't worth buying.  Captain America is a terrific movie. The lousy sound spoils it.  I know I will get a rebuttal from an employee at LG and Microsoft who will make an attempt to cover up their failings with things like it is strictly themedia player (god forbid we deliberately screwed up). And of course crummy sound is to be expected. It is par for the course with the new TVs.  Humbug!
B005IZLPME|1.0|This had to be the worst, most cheesy of all of the marvel screen adaptations. I took off my glasses halfway through, walked the dogs and left it playing while I was out, came back and watched the end. It was really stupid, don't waste your money.
B005JU5JTI|1.0|I saw some of the clips that they used to promote the movie and I thought that this could be a some worth watching. Oh how I was badly disappointed. This is utter rubbish and like someone mentioned in a previous review, which I regrettably missed before renting this movie. Do not rent it unless you like crude terrible acting with no theme or plot to speak of.<br /><br />Not even Justin Timberlake could save it.<br /><br />Give it a big miss I beg of you.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|\\"L'Elisir d'Amore\\" is a much-loved favourite of mine, and it was a true joy to watch this outstanding live production from the Vienna State Opera, which surpassed my high expectations.<br /><br />Rolando Villaz&oacute;n and Anna Netrebko are ideally matched and perfectly suited to the roles of Nemorino and Adina.  Vocally they shine, dramatically they sparkle, and their shared sense of fun is very evident.  The stage action is anything but static, with plenty of expended energy in response to a sparkling tempo from the orchestra.<br /><br />Nemorino is one of my favourite opera characters.  To dismiss him as \\"the village idiot\\" does him a great injustice.  He may be uneducated, but he is loyal and instinctively wise, and one has only to listen to his first duet with Adina (\\"Una Parola, Adina\\") to know that he has the soul of a poet.  From the moment Rolando Villaz&oacute;n walks on stage with the delicious \\"Quanto E Bella\\", he is in his element, vocally and dramatically.  He employs just enough comedy and pathos without overdoing it, and he takes me all the way from laughter to tears and back again.  After a touchingly beautiful \\"Una Furtiva Lagrima\\", the Viennese audience demands (and receives) a moving encore.<br /><br />Anna Netrebko's Adina is playful and capricious, but right from the start she allows little glimpses of a deeper side, which finally emerges as she responds to the voice of her heart and the irresistible Nemorino.  Vocally she is brilliant, and her on-stage chemistry with Mr Villaz&oacute;n is electric.<br /><br />Another highlight is Leo Nucci's Belcore - a real comic gem.  For me, this opera works best when Belcore is played as a caricature, as he is here - the swaggering, self-confident sergeant - and the perfect contrast to Nemorino.  Likewise, Ildebrando d'Arcangelo's younger, smooth talking salesman seems just right for Dr Dulcamara in this setting.  He too, makes good use of his comic talents.  Not to be overlooked is the irrepressible Inna Los, revelling in the cameo role of Giannetta.<br /><br />My only negative comment concerns the sound quality on the DVD - it is not as clear and sharp as it could be, and I found I had to tweak my audio settings and graphic equaliser quite a bit to get it right.  However, that is a minor technical flaw, and no reflection on the performance itself.<br /><br />If laughter is the best medicine, then my advice is ... do yourself a favour, and purchase this efficacious and sweet-tasting dose of \\"The Elixir of Love\\"!negative comment concerns the sound quality on the DVD - it is not as clear and sharp as it could be, and I found I had to tweak my audio settings and graphic equaliser quite a bit to get it right.

B002Q9MZF6|5.0|An opera film is vastly different from a recorded live performance, and it is impossible to compare the two.  Each has its own peculiarities and appeal.<br /><br />Robert Dornhelm's film of \\"La Boh&egrave;me\\" is amazingly good.  As a favourite opera, I've seen and heard many versions, and did not really expect to find anything \\"new\\" in this one.  How wrong I was!  At first viewing, it seemed as if I caught my breath at the start and didn't let it go until the last note died with Mimi.<br /><br />The sets are realistic and evocative of the time period and the changing seasons that underline the story.  The attention to little details is wonderful ... the rough table manners of the hungry men, the way Rodolfo fusses over the faint Mimi, his visible \\"gulp\\" as her closeness begins to affect him, the good natured teasing he receives from the others at Momus, the warming of Mimi's medicine in the final scene.<br /><br />Anna Netrebko's singing is just glorious.  Her Mimi is different from most - ill she may be, but she is certainly not helpless or emotionally fragile.  This is a girl who probably knows she doesn't have a long future, and is therefore determined to make the most of every day.  She initiates the \\"candle\\" episode, and when love comes, she seizes it.<br /><br />The Rodolfo of Rolando Villaz&oacute;n is a young man caught in a whirlwind of unexpected events - the almost unbelievable coming of love to his life, the inevitable possessiveness, the torment of his inability to save Mimi's life with his love, the ultimate despair.  He looks the part, acts the part superbly, and his wonderful voice carries his heart (and mine!) on its waves.<br /><br />This film was my first experience of the compelling artistic partnership of Mr Villaz&oacute;n and Ms Netrebko, and I can certainly see why they received such acclaim. \\"O Soave Fanciulla\\" simply took my breath away ... and from the director's comments in the bonus documentary, that reaction was not unique to me.<br /><br />The supporting cast members are likewise believable in every way - I was especially impressed with the Musetta of Nicole Cabell.  Her allure is achieved with subtle nuances of expression rather than \\"in-your-face\\" brashness ... an interesting and very appealing interpretation which reveals an underlying depth not often seen in the character of Musetta until the final scene.<br /><br />The bonus documentary is excellent - including \\"behind the scenes\\", and insightful interviews with director and cast.  It enables us to see firsthand the challenges of creating a successful operatic story when filming the scenes devoid of a live audience, orchestra and stage.<br /><br />A professional reviewer in an Australian arts magazine recently labelled this \\"the finest opera film of the last two decades\\".

B00005R23S|5.0|This DVD catapulted our family into a 25 concert run--at a time when we had toddlers at home and had to get babysitters for each concert and fly around the country and even to Europe. And now with better sound on our tv, the DVD is even better.  What makes this great? Bruce does all his best songs (Badlands, Youngstown, The River, Lost in the Flood) with great long guitar rifts and all his energy and intensity. It's almost exhausting to watch. This is a mixture of pop (My love will not let you down), the rare (Light of day), performance (Tenth Avenue Freeze out which extends for 11 or 12 minutes of talking and stomping), and edginess (ends of Youngstown and Lost in the Flood). Wow!  There are also some really good ballads including The Promise which is done very slowly with everyone participating. This is the \\"new\\" version of Born in the USA, which many people won't recognize and may not like, but it's a great version if you listen to it a few times (this newer version captures the depressing spirit of the song).
B000VJ271A|5.0|I recently read a quote attributed to Rolando Villaz&oacute;n:  \\"When opera is really good, it doesn't just touch the ears.  It opens your chest and scrambles you up.\\"  I couldn't agree more.  This opera DVD certainly has that effect on me!<br /><br />The evocative staging of this superb live performance of Massenet's Manon is confronting in its portrayal of the brazen decadence of an ugly and voyeuristic 18th century society, whose glitter falls away very quickly for the hapless Manon and Des Grieux.  The orchestral sound is rich and lush, and it is impossible not to be transported by Massenet's beautiful score.<br /><br />To me, Natalie Dessay has perfectly captured the essence of Manon.  As the story progresses the moods of her voice change sharply - from precocious naivety in Act 1, to sad inevitability in \\"Adieu Notre Petite Table\\".  There is brittle and superficial gaiety in the Gavotte, and seductiveness barely concealing pathetic desperation at Saint Sulpice.  Finally we hear genuine warmth when in her last moments, Manon finally thinks of someone other than herself.<br /><br />Des Grieux has all the superb Rolando Villaz&oacute;n trademarks - beautiful singing straight from the heart, and astonishing realism of character.  He pulled all my emotions with him on his rollercoaster ride from joy to despair.  \\"En Fermant Les Yeux\\" is an absolute highlight - the perfect mix of tenderness and ardour, flowing like golden honey.  By contrast, \\"Ah Fuyez Douce Image\\" is an outburst of inner conflict, culminating in an explosive climax.  I have no problem with his interpretation being perhaps less \\"French\\" than some others ... his distinctive, passionate sound is part of who he is and should be cherished for its individuality.<br /><br />Samuel Ramey's voice may be less elastic these days, but his performance is still powerful.  The pivotal Saint Sulpice scene between father and son is superb in its tense restraint.  I felt physical pain to see this young man, so in need of comfort and guidance, receive only cold scorn and lofty criticism.<br /><br />The bonus documentary is a fascinating insight into the production's preparation.  It is a tribute to Mr Villaz&oacute;n's superlative acting skills to see, in un-costumed rehearsal, on a bare stage surrounded by activity, with piano only and a hovering director - at the end of the death scene his face is bathed in real tears!<br /><br />The Barcelona audience were vocal in their appreciation of this performance, and I add my applause to theirs.and lofty criticism.

Even its Powerpoint is as good as Google Docs' online version. I see why this app normally sells for $15, but I'd say it's worth more like $5. Definitely 5 stars.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|I'm not sure how I felt about this book. I didn't think there was anything spectacular about it. It's one of those \\"make you think\\" kind of books.  I think seventeen year old me would have liked it more since so much of the story revolved around her boyfriend. Thirty year old me thinks that is kind of dumb. I actually liked the grandparents more.  Despite my so-so feeling, I do plan to read the sequel. I actually think it sounds better.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I've been listening to this album for the past few days since I bought it.  I'm a big fan of Christmas music... This is THE BEST Christmas album EVER (Michael, you have replaced Elvis & Bing which were my favorite Christmas albums for the past couple of decades, so I'm serious here!!!).  Every single song is really well done. Each one just as good as the next. There's no skipping tunes here. It is a pleasure to listen to from start to finish, and start over again and again all day long.   Beautiful, enchanting, perfect.   This album makes me happy and brings back wonderful Christmas memories.  Thank you very much Michael!

1451648537|5.0|Just like rest of us. No one, not even Steve himself, would view him as a saint, or have him canonized. This book revealed that Steve was a very flawed human being. But, unlike the 95% of us, he accomplished something that very few people have. His love and passion for his creations, which was uncompromisable, made his products special to millions of people. We all learn not only from our mistakes; we also learn mistakes from other people - just like Steve Jobs. I want to emulate Steve's brilliance, hard work, dedication but I will also do my best not to emulate this rudeness, brashness, and cruelty. So many of his critics on this blog are quick to villify the man, not giving credit to where the credit is due. Some come across as self-righteous hypocrites. Many people (especially the ones who have not met or worked for Jobs) hate him with passion. This is something I can never understand. They hate all apple products as if they are tools of evil, lol. I am not really surprised by Steve's unruly character. What surprises me the most are the idiotic nincompoops who hate Steve, and Apple products, with so much passion. I just don't get it why so many people are blatantly stupid.  As for the book, it is excellent! It is not well-written but the author did not intend it to be. The stories are very candid, and and is written verbatim. Just the way it is supposed to be. Some criticized the grammar. LOL, I can't believe this people! As long as I can undertand the story, it's good enough for me. This is not a thesis for an English Masters program. Geesh!

B002ZG98LO|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this film.  There is an unusual mix of characters, who find themselves falling onto a planet that has an unusual jungle and some frightening creatures.  They wonder what is going on, in particular when they figure out that all of them are killers in one way or another, with the apparent exception of a mild mannered doctor.  As they slowly get picked off, it dawns on them that they are not on Earth.  They must then choose whether or not to cooperate with each other, which none of them seem gifted at doing.  Once they meet a survivor (an overweight and perhaps insane Fishburne), they learn even more about the predators.  The survivors - for a sequel - do evolve as characters, which is also fun.<br /><br />I liked the way that the Predator concept evolves in this one.  There is more than one species and they seem to be blood enemies.  They are also training themselves with the hunt of man and each other across predator species.  While they have the same macho enjoyment of blood fights, they also hunt in threes in this film.  While their vulnerabilities are greater in this film (an inconsistency), the human fighters are better actors even than the first one.  The story is also more coherent than the first, in my opinion.<br /><br />REcommended.  This is a welcome addition to the series.  It is a fun watch and advances the concept.

B005PYJCA0|4.0|Before I had heard of the term grunge, a friend of mine turned me onto this band, what he termed 'psychadelic meets garage'. I remember one writer way back when saying \\"listening to Jane's Addiction is the aural equivelant to sharing a dirty needle\\" or something like that. Some of rock's greatest acts always seemed to be able to conjure up a palpable sense of menace. Sabbath, Crimson, Metallica, Pantera, Tool, Opeth at times, Led Zep at times, but Jane's Addiction rivaled the best punk or metal bands for pure vitriol and danger. Like the line in Pigs In Zen, \\"some people should die, that's just unconscious knowledge\\", sounded like a psychopath on the verge of a killing spree. I still listen to Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual quite often.  Well, I've had this a few days now and I think it's killer. Not as sleazy as the first couple of albums, but not at all spit and polished as their under-the-radar comeback, Strays from '03. More attention is paid to atmosphere on this one and although its not quite the druggy vibe they once had, it still rocks. They present the material like a band that still wants you to hear the song. No anger or vitriol in the lyrics or delivery, but still disenfranchised, wiser but bitter and they still play a heavy brand of rock. And there's plenty of space in the production and mixing, something aspiring stoner rock bands should take note of. The writing is strong, even if there isn't anything as infectious as Jane Says or Been Caught Stealing. The musicianship is as good as ever.  This band predates grunge by a few years but defines that movement just as well as, oh say Pearl Jam, but seems to have matured better than many bands of that era. They're not trying to prove anything or appeal to a different audience. They're wise to play to their strengths, act their age and not try any contrived angst or forced over-the-top presentation. Its a good, compelling album that even a moderate Jane's fan can appreciate.

1451648537|5.0|INTRODUCTION  Apple has always meant more to me than as a computer company, because of my early experiences in the late 1970's and early 1980's from age 8 using the Apple ][, //e, and later the Mac.  They represented amazing products that I could understand even as a child, that this was the direction of the future.  It was odd to me then, that the world was still embracing the MS-DOS command line interface and the IBM PC/AT machines.  When in the late 1990's, Apple neared bankruptcy, with Microsoft Windows dominating the market, it taught me as a young man that companies that try to make the very best can be under appreciated by the masses, just as the adults near me in the 1980's could not see the amazing nature of my Apple //e and Mac back then.  Good guys, it seemed, do finish last.  It was disheartening.  Since the return of Steve Jobs to Apple, the world now knows of his genius and brilliance.  This biography is utterly amazing.  I could not stop reading the entire biography and finished in less than 2 days.  WHAT I LIKED  1. Extraordinarily comprehensive - The book covers an immense number of different \\"phases\\" of his life from his famous adoption story to the start of Apple Computer, to NeXt, Pixar, love life, development of his iconic products, to the time before his death (although his death is actually never mentioned).  2. Ruthlessly objective - As a fan of Steve Jobs, I cringed at all the negative descriptions of Jobs's conduct with strangers, his management team, other CEO's, etc.  I knew of his candor and lack of sensitivity towards others, but the degree to which this is depicted made me cringe and even wonder if Jobs should not be garnering so much world-wide respect.  This sentiment was strong in the beginning of the biography, but by the end of the biography, I had actually become accustomed to Jobs's personality through the biography, almost as if I had personally known the man and adapted to him.  The biography actually made me feel like I knewhim.  3. Extraordinary historical perspective - Even if this biography were not to mention Steve Jobs, it would be fascinating.  There is so much written about the history of Silicon Valley, other famous CEOs, musicians, artists, politicians, etc, that the book is enticing.  4. Extraordinary perspective on other famous leaders - Jobs spoke candidly about his opinions regarding virtually every important person that may have crossed his path.  There are comments and stories regarding John Sculley, President Clinton, Obama, Bill Gates, Jeffrey Katzenberg (Disney), Michael Eisner (Disney), Bob Iger (Disney), Bono, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Yoko Ono, Steve Wozniak, Larry Ellison (Oracle), Eric Schmidt (Google), Larry Page (Google), Andy Grove (Intel), etc.  5. Extremely detailed descriptions of Jobs's business decision-making processes - This is true throughout the biography, but especially so towards the last third, where there is an extraordinarily detailed account by Jobs of his thought process during development of the iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad, and iCloud.  In this latter third of the biography, whatever doubt may have existed of whether or not Jobs should be so revered is laid to rest when we witness his amazing decision-making ability.  6. Unexpectedly funny - Especially in the very beginning of the biography, you can't help but laugh when you read about John Sculley's first day at Apple and seeing Jobs sitting on a desk playing with his bare toes.  7. Jobs's personal life - This has always been an enigma and the most many knew of Jobs's personal life came from his 2005 Stanford commencement speech.  We see into his early girlfriends' perspectives of Jobs, his current wife and children's perspective.  The fascinating story of his biological parents, biological sister, daughter for whom he initially denied custody, three children and wife.  There is much written about his perspective on Zen Buddhism and his trek to India.  8. Extremely detailed - For all the above points, there was an immense amount of detail that I never envisioned would exist in this biography.  9. Easy to read - The author makes reading each sentence effortless.  WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE  1. Not enough photos - The few photos that were included were great, but it left you wanting more.  2. Possibly too much of the negative aspects of Jobs's personality were described - No doubt that the man could belittle others, but there was so much emphasis of this especially in the beginning of the bio, that I wondered if the author didn't try too hard to make this point for fear of being accused of being too soft in his description of Jobs  3. Some very slight repetition in the very beginning of the biography from passages found in the middle and end of the biography.  4. I wished for more of Steve Jobs's perspective - Every now and then, the author would mention what Jobs thought of a certain past event but I wish there were more of those.  So much of the biography read more like a history book trying to be objective and accurate, but I really wanted to know what Jobs thought about everything.  I wanted his perspective more, even if it would make the book less objective.  CONCLUSION  This biography is amazing because of the subject matter, but it is also well-written.  It seemed to be such an effort at objectiveness, however, that it actually lacked what I wanted to read most, which was Jobs's perspective.  I appreciated the author's efforts and painting an accurate historical picture, but I really wanted to know what was on Jobs's mind regarding everything that was written about him.  There was not enough of that, which is unfortunate, because it is in my opinion, his perspective that mattered the most.
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|I have been overseas the past two years and have missed a lot of my favorite television shows, so I have taken to ordering a few of my favorites online.  If you buy from the \\"used section\\" be aware that occassionally these DVD's skip.  Mine did a bit-but nothing that took away from the show itself.<br /><br />The season is wonderful, the characters, the story line, the suspense-overall every episode was outstanding (as D.H. always is!  If you are on the fence, get this-you won't regret it!

0765309408|5.0|I'm a heavy SciFi fan, reading about 1-2 books per week.  After experiencing the plots of Asimov and Heinlein, along with the prose of George R. R. Martin, I've become fairly disillusioned with new offerings.  However, Old Man's War (OMW) is just amazing.  I can't recall the last time I just could NOT put a book down, reading it throughout the entire night.  The characters are emphatic (especially the protagonist), the plot is plausible (especially if you like military novels), and the story is equal parts compelling and heart-breaking (with the descriptions of the protagonist's wife painfully nostalgic).  You simply cannot ask for a better book published in the past five years.  As far as I'm concerned, five stars does this book a disservice.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are wonderful headphones, I had a pair prior to these so I knew how great they were.  Only reason I bought another pair was that I had caught the headphones on the cabinet and they had only sound in 1 ear.  I Like that they fit just inside the ear I can wear thse while running on the street and still hear cars or people, with the ear buds could not.  Great Product. Will recommend these to people that run on the streets.

B000NA28I4|2.0|After I read the book \\"Eragon\\", I thought to myself, \\"Wow, if they made a movie of this, it would be amazing.\\" Then one of my friends told me there already was a movie! Needless to say, I was pretty excited, and got my hands on it as soon as possible. I'm sorry to say, my love of Eragon was a little deflated. This has to be one of the worst fantasy movies I've ever seen besides The Last Airbender.  Just a few of its major flaws-  1) It doesn't follow the book AT ALL! Every time I watch it, I wonder if the director even read the book! It started off okay, then gradually got worse...and worse...and by the end, I actually said, \\"Christopher Paolini has got to be furious at this.\\" No trip across the Hadarac Desert, no Twins, no Isidar Mirthrim. I was especially disappointed at the dwarf city, Tronjheim. You get quite a picture in your head when you read the book, but in the movie, it's so plain and unimpressive I almost skipped the scene.  2) The script was absolutely horrible. I cringe every time Eragon says, \\"Closer, so we can reach his heart!\\" or when Murtagh says, \\"I suggest you leave quickly!\\" If Mr. Paolini lent a hand in writing the script, it would've been good, but he didn't, and it had the crappiest dialogue I've ever seen in a movie.  3) Character development- none WHATSOEVER. Brom's just a grumpy old man, which, yes, he is in the book too, but the book makes you feel sorry for him when he dies. In the movie, you're just like, \\"Oh, Brom died? Oh well. Let's move on.\\" And they just had to put Jeremy Irons in as Brom, which really makes me mad because he's a very good actor, but this movie brings his acting score way down.   Arya had almost no part. She says a few lines scattered throughout the film, but there's no real part she plays. She's an imprisoned elf, Eragon rescues her, she doesn't stay deathly sick like she's supposed to, and in the final battle, she's an invincible amazon woman who doesn't even get a scratch.  Eragon was okay, I guess: not as bad aseveryone else. I had to give some credit to Ed Speleers. For this being his first movie ever and it being a trashy one at that, he actually did quite a decent job as Eragon, and was probably the most believable character in the movie. But like everyone else, there was no feeling to the characters. You couldn't sympathize with them, laugh with them, or anything.  And a few more minor ones-  1) Why does Saphira have feathers? She's a dragon, people, not a bird.  2) Arya is an elf, and she's supposed to have pointed ears.  3) In Carvahall, everyone's clothes are rags except for Eragon's (and Roran's, who's wearing JEANS!{yeah, no joke}), whose clothes are like a prince's.  The one positive thing I have to say about this movie is the animation for Saphira. Her motions were really smooth and flawless- almost as good as the CG for 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes.'  So, if you haven't read the book, this movie would be kind of okay, I guess, but if you have, avoid this like the plague.
0385534639|3.0|Heard a lot of good things about this book ages before it was released. So expectations were high, but the book didn't live up to it. It was beautifully written. Clean and elegant. Kept my interest for the first half of the book. But by the second, I was struggling to get through it.   There are characters aplenty, but they are ALL one-dimensional. Including the titular characters of Celia and Marco. Granted, I was more intrigued by Marco because of the mystery behind his magic - very cryptic - but he eventually came off as tragically desperate. Sure, love is crazy, but it was out-of-character and felt forced. The Celia was a mess. She tries hard to be sophisticated but instead comes off as pompous. The other characters are scattered everywhere, but you know nothing about them so you don't really care.  The only character who I felt should have gotten more face time was Isobel, Marco's girlfriend. When I first came across the idea of a another woman in the mix, I was immediately intrigued. But the author didn't use her. So the tension was non-existent. She was severely underused and I was severely disappointed. So was A.H. Intriguing character. Never used to full potential.  Then you have the character of Bailey, Poppet, and Widget. Could care less about them. Found myself skipping the chapters with them in it. I thought they were building Bailey up for something big, but his purpose was less than.   What irritated me the most was how much time the author spent focusing on the circus itself. She went to extremes to try and convince you how brilliant and amazing and fantastic the circus was instead of focusing on character development. This was all fine and dandy at first, but the description was just too much after a while. Enough. We get it. The circus is the most fantastic thing ever, but stop. Just stop. And don't get me started with the description of Celia's dresses. Apparently they are just as important as the circus itself....  There was no conflict at all. Inever really got the \\"competition\\". It got to a point that I think the author didn't fully understand the competition either. It was all so vague and scattered. Hell, I still don't understand why the outcome of the competition had to be what it was. Why? It was suppose to be one big endurance and psychological mind-fudge, but there was no reason behind it might have well been pointless.  The ending was anticlimactic to say the least. I'll try the author again if she comes out with another book because I liked her style very much. It's her first novel so we all deserve another chance. Hopefully she'll focus on character development and plot rather than focusing on what they were wearing (we know Marco wears bowler hats. So the first time you said it, we got it) or on establishing venue.

B0050XFY4O|5.0|You won't see many movies that glorify the relationship of siblings in a sexual manner. Which is what makes this movie such a rare gem. It's heart warming and sexy at the same time. You root for the brothers the whole way!Q
B004UHF51S|5.0|This cd is a real masterpiece. Once again Michael Franks demonstrates that he is a great singer and a great songwriter. Like always, on Time Together he works with a group of outstanding musicians. It all sounds very familiar with famous names like Will Lee on bass, David Spinozza on guitar and Jerry Marotta on drums, amongst many others. The atmosphere reminds me to The Art of Tea and Sleeping Gipsy, which I think are still his best albums. I am already looking forward to the next album (hopefully featuring the good old Crusaders, or at least Joe Sample on piano).
B004J4WKTW|2.0|because, unlike most book adaptations, the movie is bound to be better than the book.  I won't go into how poor the writing is--read Amy Geneva's clever review. And where was the editor?  It's a  loooonnnnng, book with thin plot, even thinner characters, but one great idea, which should look spectacular on film.  I should've waited for the film.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I am very impressed with the graphics compared to the 1st one. As soon as this came out I bought it from Android Market since I was still addicted to the 1st after months of playing.<br />I don't really know why but I'm not quite as impressed by the gameplay as I was with the 1st, but I definitely still love it and again addicted. I think it's worth paying for for sure.<br />But if you didn't get this as the FAOTD then I would recommend the 1st one if you are new to the game. It isn't as visually appealing, but gameplay is better for some reason I can't quite put my finger on.<br />App works great on my HTC Evo Shift. Never had a problem with the 1st or 2nd version. Gem Spinner I &amp; II will be on my phone for a long time to come.
1451648537|5.0|I am both an artist and a technologist.  Every day I ride the Steve Jobs zen motorcycle to resolve the riddle:  is quality possible in a commodity economy?  Is art even allowable in order to make an effective buck in business software implementation?  Yet the successes in my career have been achieved by providing what is aesthetic within what is practical.    The Walter Issacson book is not just the telling of a great man's life.  It's the takeaway from the book to achieve quality in what we produce and how we produce it that matters.  The writer is well aware of this as the biographical sermon unfolds.  Certainly Steve's own hand guides Walter to achieve this lesson.   In summary this book is not just for those who want to read about someone great who changed the world, whose products many of us use as extensions of ourselves.  It's also instruction for engineers and artists, stuck in a commodity versus quality mindset given our economy, to go about changing it ourselves.

030788743X|5.0|However, I am neither young nor old, but as I am somewhat of a closet nerd, I still enjoyed this book.<br /><br />I will try not to give a general overview of the book as the publishers description already does a good job.<br /><br />This book was a very fun, easy to read and definitely very nerdy.  Although the book takes place in the future, in a virtual world, most of the nerd references are about video games, songs and movies from the 1980's.  I am old enough that I was able to pick up on a lot of the references, but young enough that there were some that I had to look up on the internet as I had never heard of them before.<br /><br />The book moves at fairly quick pace with little down time between the action, which was enjoyable.  The beginning of the book did seem to start off a little slow, but after about 50 to 75 pages, I could not put the book down.<br /><br />I felt like this book gave just enough description so that you had a general idea of what each scene looked liked, but it also left enough up to your imagination so that you could fill in the details.  Despite the ending of the book being fairly apparent from the start, the ride to the end was very much enjoyable.<br /><br />As for recommendations, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is familiar with 80's nerd references (i.e. Joust, The Last StarFighter, Dokken, etc).  In addition, it would appeal to young adults.  The characters in the book are all high school level kids.  With that said, I would also generally recommend it to all who consider themselves nerds (myself included) and enjoy virtual worlds or other similar nerdy things.

0142419400|5.0|What a sweet book.  It's long and there are lots of secondary plot lines, but the main takeaway is that this is a sweet book.  Anna is bummed when her newly rich dad decides to impress his friends by sending her to Paris for a school year.  Sure it's Paris and all, but she has a life at home in Atlanta.  It's hard to start over in a new school, especially when you don't even speak the language.<br /><br />She's immediately drawn to St. Clair (as is every single girl in the school).  He's handsome and nice and they have lots in common.  The only problem is, not only does he have a girlfriend, but the one girl who's been nice to Anna is secretly madly in love with him.  Plus, Anna maybe has a boyfriend back home.  It's best if she and St. Clair are just friends.<br /><br />Best laid plans and all that jazz...<br /><br />I love how nice Meredith is to Anna on her first day and every day thereafter.  She made all the difference in Anna's first few days.  There are a lot of supporting characters and they are all great.  Every one of them is believable, with quirks and personalities.  As the friends grow closer as a group, there are lots of opportunities for them to get along and fight and make up, all in very real ways.  They make mistakes and learn from them, especially Anna.<br /><br />The dialogue is perfect, everyone has their own personalities and the dialogue is a great reflection of that.  Snappy comebacks and not-so-snappy comebacks.  Friendly banter and the more serious stuff.  All of it is realistic.<br /><br />I think Stephanie Perkins must have been a foodie in a past life, because she can paint a yummy picture with her words.  There are lots of descriptions of foods and sweets and anyone with a sweet tooth or a love of French food will enjoy this book.<br /><br />This book is so romantic, it is like a perfect depiction of falling in love.  Seriously, this has everything you could want in a teen romance book.  It's sweet and tender, but has typical teenage issues like friendship, jealousy and immaturity.<br /><br />The Sum Up:  A wonderful story about falling in love and growing up.  It's long, but you'll love every minute of it.  This is contemporary ya at its finest.<br /><br />\\"As reviewed by A Busy bibliophile.\\":  A wonderful story about falling in love and growing up.

B005OCFHHK|3.0|I have read alot of comments, google'd the sets and still went with the harry potter blu-ray set found amazon.co.uk do a search for harry potter 1-8<br />you should see it.<br /><br />ok so i get the set a couple days later but I only paid 48$ for 11 blu-ray discs (8 movie discs and 3 additional discs).<br /><br />ok so they are region free but they are region free which means they have nothing added to them to prevent you from watching in almost any blu-ray player (yes works fine in ps3 also).<br /><br />bottom line you get more Harry Potter for half the price which in my book is ok. Also these discs will be same ones in the US versions minus the region crap incase you read some detail you liked on the US version being released for 97$. Save the extra 49$ for the Ultimate Ultimate Ultimate Edition Complete set \\"with all the extra footage we have\\" - till we find some more and release it again.
0802798225|5.0|The premise is based on the Romeo and Juliet, 2 different sides of the track idea.  These 2 kids are too different to make it work.  They have different backgrounds, different lifestyles; too different for them even to associate with each other in school, let alone outside of school.<br /><br />Alex is a bad boy gang member and Brittany's a prissy ice princess.  Can you see where this is going?  Yeah, I could too, after about the first page.  But that shouldn't stop you from giving it a chance.  Because getting there is very very fun.<br /><br />They have a near disastrous meeting in the parking lot on the first day of school and of course they're immediately assigned to be lab partners in Chemistry class (based on the alphabetical order of their last names, natch).  Initially, they barely tolerate each other and try to outsmart the other with their witty banter and attitudes.<br /><br />But are the attitudes covering something?  Could there be more beneath the surface?  Or are the stereotypes true?  When a fellow gang member offers his car in a bet to see if Alex can bed the perfect Brittany by Thanksgiving, he figures she's too lily-white for him to truly be interested in.  She means nothing to him, so of course he takes the bet.<br /><br />They are forced to spend time together to work on their Chemistry project and pretty soon sparks start to fly.  They begin to see another side of each other.  Ice princess with a not-so-perfect home life?  Check.  Gang member with a heart of gold?  Check.  Clich&eacute;s abound, but they work here.  Elkeles' writing makes them seem new and different.  You can see the development of their relationship and it happens in a very believable way.<br /><br />There is plenty of sizzle as their dislike turns to lust, both of them insisting there's nothing there.  Once they get past the stereotypes, their relationship moves at a lightning fast pace.  They fall hard and fast, as teenagers tend to do.<br /><br />Each chapter alternates between Alex's and Brittany's point of view which I felt made it easy to get into the story, to know what they are thinking.  Both main characters, and most of the supporting players, are very well-developed.  You care quickly about them and understand why they do the things they do.  They are flawed and gritty and real.<br /><br />There is cussing a'plenty (in 2 different languages - bonus!) and lusty sexy scenes that made my heart go pitter patter.  But again, it all felt very real and honest.<br /><br />The sum up:  Perfect Chemistry rocks.  The premise feels new and fresh.  The romance is raw and honest.  Put this on your must read list right now.<br /><br />\\"As reviewed by The Busy Bibliophile.\\"to get into the story, to know what they are thinking.

B003CN4R74|4.0|One thing that Evanescence is known for is drama.  Just look at Amy Lee.  She screams drama.  Look at the cover art to their albums.  Drama.  Listen to the way that Amy incorporates that slight operatic edge to her music.  DRAMA.  So, in listening to their latest album I couldn't help but dissect the tracks in terms of dramatic tension.  These songs swim in that realm, and so understanding the focal points of the tracks is interesting and fun.  So, this is an odd review for me but I hope you enjoy it.  I've decided to take each track, one by one, and simply point out the key dramatic moments.<br /><br />Let's start at the beginning.<br /><br />`What You Want' - 2:22 and then again at 2:30 / Lee's vocals combined with the sharp shift in musical composition add to the dramatic weight of the track.<br /><br />`Made of Stone' - the extra drum kick at 1:46 adds a welcomed kick, but the real `moment' is found at 2:10 when Amy's vocals reach that pitch and then at 2:23 when she hits the word \\"remember\\" (possibly my favorite vocal `moment' on the album) and the musical tones shift slightly; it almost becomes operatic in texture and the `drama' is certainly heightened.<br /><br />`The Change' - then entire chorus can constitute as drama, the first of which begins at merely 44 seconds in, but even the milky way in which Amy delivers the verses are drenched in drama.  The vocal cascade at 2:38 that spills into the final chorus is explosive, but the real `moment' for me is the way Amy utters that final \\"enough\\"; the way it bleeds out totally reads `drama'.<br /><br />`My Heart Is Broken' - the piano backing instrumentation is flawlessly atmospheric, and Lee's dragged out words always add dramatic emphasis, but listen to the sudden baritone to adopts for certain words (like the word \\"us\\" at 1:36).  But it's the rise and fall that really elevates the drama here.  The escalation beginning at 3:00, those vocals at 3:07 and then the comedown at 3:21 is brilliantly played to swell beneath the listener's skin.<br /><br />`The Other Side' - the reverberated \\"home\\" at 2:14 is pure drama.<br /><br />`Erase This' - this song is drama from beginning to end, but the way Amy hits the word \\"is\\" at a mere 39 seconds in is just astonishing.  The chorus breakdowns are powerful and stirring, and then it just goes to a whole other level starting with the bridge at 2:12 and then just comes full circle with the bleed-through into the chorus again at 2:33 (well, structure-wise), finishing off the song with perfect dramatic sense.<br /><br />`Lost in Paradise' - this distilled vocals evoke pure drama, especially with Amy's signature operatic overtones, but it is at the musical upswing at 1:51 and then, more effectively, the musical shift at 3:20 that really brings it all together.  All in all, this is one of the most dramatic tracks on the album.<br /><br />`Sick' - the track carries on much like a generic rock track, but the muted \\"sick of it all\\" that starts at 2:42 adds that little touch of flavor; and the chorus itself is pretty aggressive and `dramatic'.<br /><br />`End of the Dream' - just wait for the way she hits \\"dream\\" at 1:27; it's flawless.  Sure, she drags out her words a lot, but the pitch she lathers onto that word at that moment sends shivers.<br /><br />`Oceans' - it's all about that sharp, yet subtle tonal shift at 1:41, that comes and fades into the chorus, but it's enough to grab our attention (I love those little details).  And then there is the musical spiral that begins at 2:21, and that burst after split silence at 2:45 that just takes the drama up another notch.  But she doesn't stop there; you have her fade out of the word \\"hands\\" at 3:21, which is followed by those `oh so serious' violins.<br /><br />`Never Go Back' - the drama begins at a mere 55 seconds in when the second half of the chorus enlists the crunching of guitars and the pleading of Amy's vocals.  It is a nice contrast to the overall speed of the balance of the track; a noticeable dramatic diversion.  2:25 begins the piano work (another tonal shift that is so effective) and that is accompanied by haunting vocals that begin to peak at 2:55, when the violins lend aid and then it all folds into that explosive `second' chorus again at 3:18, rounding out the dramatic tension in the song.<br /><br />`Swimming Home' - the track carries on with no sign of drama, feeling very much like a track Team Sleep would have put together, and then the 2:27 mark comes around and the subtle bounce of lightness fades into a more dramatic sensation as things slow down even more and Amy's vocals start to dwell within that baritone range she pulls out at all the right moments.  It's a small moment, for the track diverts back to the pop tones, but it is enough to make an impression.<br /><br />For me, this is certainly a solid effort.  I think I slightly prefer `The Open Door' to this one, but in all honesty they have really come a long way since their debut and should concentrate on putting out more music (we shouldn't have to wait five years for new music; two years TOPS).  Evanescence can run the risk of sounding a little too similar on some tracks, to where they tend to run together a bit, which is why the closing track is so refreshing because it has such a different sound and scales back the `drama' enough to evoke a different feeling.  Don't get me wrong, I love the drama that Amy and company brings to their work (it's the reason I listen to them) but slight variations do go a long way.<br /><br />And no one can deny that Amy Lee has, possibly, the best female vocals in rock music today (maybe even `music', period) and so hearing her sing is a blessing and a privilege and should be indulged at regular intervals.ed by haunting vocals that begin to peak at 2:55, when the violins lend aid and then it all folds into that explosive `second' chorus again at 3:18, rounding out the dramatic tension in the song.  `Swimming Home' - the track carries on with no sign of drama, feeling very much like a track Team Sleep would have put together, and then the 2:27 mark comes around and the subtle bounce of lightness fades into a more dramatic sensation as things slow down even more and Amy's vocals start to dwell within that baritone range she pulls out at all the right moments.

B005IGVZX2|5.0|I have to admit, Mr. Waits' output from Mule Variations on haven't done as much for me as his earlier works (excluding Orpahns, some awesome music there).  This album though seems like a culmination of all of the lessons he has learned touring the world, playing piano bars, and being a husband.  There isn't a weak track on the record.  And the LP sounds great!  Really cool lyric/picture book and a full CD of the album included.  Although now I'll most likely buy the Deluxe to get the extra tracks and give the new CD to someone who likes music.  Buy this one and drive around some of the rougher parts of your city and you'll swear Tom was just there, writing what you are seeing.
B005QPGHQU|2.0|This album has none of the intimacy of any of the other albums. I found the previous albums completely engaging because it felt like Amy sharing her thoughts and feelings with the listener in a very emotionally engaging way. On this album she seems to be trying so hard just to be heard over the nearly non-stop \\"wall of sound\\" of the rest of the group that all the intimacy is lost. I've pre-ordered exactly 3 CDs in my entire life but this is the first one that really let me down.
B000005TRO|5.0|I love the song of the CD. Laura looks fresh and the songs are very romantic. It was one of her first CDs and her beginning was simply amazing!!!
B005K0S2SW|5.0|This cd just screams from the first track to the last. If you like New Orleans funk/jazz/soul/rock jam bands you have got to pick this one up. The roots from this genre of music runs long and deep from the Big Easy. This groove is a lot like Backatown in that the music just flows together with massive amounts of electric rhythms, harmony's and melodies. The musicianship is top notch as you would expect from this group. The songs are well organized and packed with all the energy that the speakers can tolerate. No lack of syncopation on this train ride folks. There are guest appearances from guitar legend and master Jeff Beck along with Warren Haynes, Kid Rock and Ledisi. For me this is a no brainer 5 star session. If you are looking for some great grooves to stretch out on, give this one a listen. Highly recommended for music lovers of this genre, or just great music lovers in general, for true. See my other reviews.<br /><br />John W. Shearer<br />(Art Mule Snapfish)

B005HS00V4|5.0|I just received my blu ray copy and watched the concert.  It is simply amazing!  First of all, the video and audio quality is the best it can get.  I don't care for 3D so I have the normal version.  All the songs have been re-worked for orchestra and they are mind blowing.  If I had to single out songs, I would say Biko, Rhythm of the Heat, and Single to Noise will blow you away. Just to sum up, Peter is a man in full control of what he does, this is an amazing concert and concept.  It is not just a rock concert with orchestra, it uses the orchestra as the main elements.  You need to experience it for yourself. Very highly recommended.
B000003MZU|5.0|I love this CD, I have listened it for five or six times!!!! I prefer the song: Como la abeja al panal, but all songs are very good. I give it five stars, excellent choice.
B005LB1MY6|4.0|Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Aug&eacute;, the Parisian pair that make up Justice, took the world by storm with their 2007 debut record, \\"Cross.\\" Drawing instant comparisons to the likes of Daft Punk, another electronic dance duo, Justice quickly began selling out arenas and headlining festivals with their heavy hitting beats and instantly catchy hooks.<br /><br />On \\"Audio, Video, Disco,\\" Justice expands upon their successful debut with more elements of rock and roll including songs driven by power chords and electric guitar solos. That is not to say Justice has strayed away from the electronic dance tunes that gave them an audience; far from it. \\"Audio, Video, Disco\\" is still a dance album likely to receive a heavy rotation in clubs around the world, but Justice's sound is more progressive than before and they're formulating a more unique identity for themselves as their sound evolves.<br /><br />For the first minute of the opening track, \\"Horsepower,\\" it sounds as though the song could fit just as easily on a Dream Theater record.<br /><br />Harmonized guitars playing arpeggios, drum fills on the third and fourth beats of every measure, and only hints of a synthesized loop in the distance. The track continues to build rapidly, however, filling the listener with anticipation until an abrupt fade out followed by the Justice entrance everyone was expecting.<br /><br />\\"Horsepower\\" eventually blossoms into one of the most familiar sounding Justice tracks on the entire record. A kick drum pounds the ears on every beat, synthesizer chords filter in and out, and the guitar work that sounded like a progressive rock intro in the beginning quickly blends right in with the rest of this powerful instrumental. If there's one track on this album destined for another commercial spot, it's this one.<br /><br />The biggest hit to come from \\"Cross\\" was \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" thanks, in part, to an incredibly infectious vocal part. Like their debut, \\"Audio, Video, Disco\\" once again calls on the occasional guest vocal to really get the crowd moving. \\"Civilization\\" leans heavily on British singer Ali Love to carry the melody and although the track is repetitive, the addition of Love's voice makes the recording one of the most memorable of the entire record.<br /><br />Although the more balanced blend of electronica and rock and roll sets Justice apart from many other electronic groups and DJs, there are still certain elements of their rock side that feel less original. The guitar work on \\"Newlands\\" is exceptionally reminiscent of much of AC/DC's catalog and the \\"We Will Rock You\\" style stomps and claps of \\"Parade\\" are not even trying to hide their similarities to Queen, but the end result is still enjoyable and proof that Justice has plenty left in store for the world.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Daft Punk, Deadmau5<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Horsepower\\". \\"Civilization\\" leans heavily on British singer Ali Love to carry the melody and although the track is repetitive, the addition of Love's voice makes the recording one of the most memorable of the entire record.

B001KZVQJI|3.0|Bought this bluray edition assuming wrongfully that it will include some interesting extra features. The only noteworthy ones were a couple of scenes only found in the extended version. The PIP and concept artwork under the U-control feature is totally meaningless as they appear in tiny screens at the corner of the movie while it is running, being without audio and without the option to expand or pause them! I wonder why they did not include all the extras found in the normal DVD special editions. Shame, because the movie is so much sharper in bluray format.
1439192812|5.0|Dawkins' books usually don't disappoint, and this is not an exception. I absolutely enjoyed reading, \\"The Magic of Reality.\\" Even though it is geared towards children twelve and up, I still found myself enthralled by the way Dawkins was able to explain things. Not only were the explanations fun and interesting, but the artwork is beautiful.   Dawkins begins each chapter with a question, then it is followed by myths from around the world that claim to explain the phenomena. After describing these myths, Dawkins proceeds to give the scientific explanation, which as he says, is far more magical. My favorite chapter would have to be the one that describes why bad things happen. I have countless friends who take coincidences and blow them up into revelations. Dawkins gives an explanation of large numbers and how people focus on things they want to, while ignoring everything else.  The chapter on miracles was also very good. In this chapter, Dawkins explains why natural explanations are preferred over supernatural ones. He also details David Hume's argument against miracles.  The book is beautifully illustrated and was a joy to read. I plan on buying a copy for myself and my nieces and nephews.
B00192IV9U|5.0|Michael Jackson's music is about his God-given gift of wonderful, catchy melodies and messages on his lyrics.  Now, that Michael is no longer here to perfect these gifts in releasable formats, Michael knows and would even agree that his being perfectionism is no big deal anymore.  Because on top of that, even when Michael was alive, what is more important to him is to share his gifts with the world, with his fans, literally with everyone.  Michael would want people now to reperesent him, to finish some of his unfinished music for him, for the world to continuously hear and listen new music from his soul, to discover the beauty of his unreleased music, and just like on his previous releases, for the world to learn something from these songs, from his melodies and messages of these songs.  This is, I think, the truest essence of respecting Michael's legacy.    Michael's legacy as a musician is not about his being perfectionist, but is all about his heart.  And his heart desires making people happy and touching people's lives all over the world with his music - both past and posthumous releases.  Trust me.  This is what Michael wants.  Please support Michael's new music releases.  Buy this album, MICHAEL.  The people behind it did a great job in keeping what Michael would want for the finished tracks.  They're not a musical genius like Michael, but they did their best with these songs.  Michael would want them, like Teddy Riley, etc, to polish these tracks for him not that he knows that he can no longer do it.  I know that Michael was and thankful and appreciated what Teddy Riley, et al did on this album.  I am looking forward to more new music of Michael.  Let's share his music with the world.  Let's do it for Michael.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I LISTENED TO THE CD TODAY. THIS IS A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FOR COLDPLAY.   SOME SONGS ARE FUN AND UPBEAT AND SOME SONGS ARE VERY PERSONAL LIKE US AGAINST THE WORLD, 5 STARS FOR COLDPLAY  . THIS ALBUM IS A MASTERPIECE WITH GREAT MELODIES AND AND INSTURMENTS FOR THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC
0307887898|5.0|Lean Startup can be described as a long missing Scrum Product Owner handbook. For years Scrum had role of Product Owner who magically knows what the business needs. Not many people were really qualified to do this job however. Lean Startup seems to be provide great system, process or way of thinking that every product owner should be aware about.   Other way of thinking about it is that Erik explains in detail what \\"respond to change\\" means in business terms.   Both ways this seems to be first good approach to explain agile product management in detail.  Definitely worth a shot.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|do yourself a favor and get Florence + The Machine's new album. Coldplay lost some points in my book with this album, hopefully they'll redeem themselves next time around. Let's just act like this never happened.   Highlights: 'Hurts Like Heaven', 'Us Against The World', and 'Charlie Brown'
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this app does everything it says and more.  if you don't like google docs that's no reason to give a bad review. thanx Amazon for offering it free for a day!
B000YDOOU0|5.0|One track skips on this cd.  Other than that the cd is great!  Pat has done it again.  False advertising.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I have just received my second set and it still will not play on my updated blu ray player. Disc 4 stops at 2:23 seconds on both sets I have received. Additionally Disc 2 played oat first but now none will, they all freeze after getting to the main menu. Has anyone else had this problem? My other blu rays from other manufacturers work.
B000B5UW3O|5.0|I ordered FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS for my husband after we had toured a site in Colorado that had a direct connection to this book.  He has been mesmerized by the book--hard to put down, very intriguing.  He has noted that Ernest Hemingway captivates the reader and pulls him into the action.  The book was well worth the price--I ordered a used book with the caption like new.  When it came, it looked as if it had never been opened--no folded corners, pages, no markings, etc.  Well worth the reading!!
B0051GOB26|5.0|awesome movie complimented by outstanding packaging. saw it at the store, and ordered on amazon for a few bucks cheaper, very nice.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|I really love this show!  I wish ABC smartened up and brought it back or at least made a movie for it.  I really miss this show.  The characters are just so lovable (or some are the type you just love to hate).  The storylines are so out there, but at the same time have quite a few bits that are relatable and have something you can learn from.  There is a little bit for everybody.
1451648537|5.0|Good price, good book, very good quality, arrived on time. What more can I say, its just perfect. All the apple fanboys would worship this book. :D
B005FITIF0|5.0|I've seen the film 6 times in 6 different places all across the country, and I saw it with Sam Childers the first time he saw it. It's an amazing story about a nearly unbelievable journey by a man who went from crazy bad to crazy good, 'cos it takes a little crazy to do what he'd done as a young man and what he's done in Africa over the past decade. Fortunately there is less confrontation with the LRA in the area where the Shekinah Children's Village is near Nimule, South Sudan; and Sam Childers is spreading his feeding programs wider across central and east Africa where they're needed so badly, like in Somalia and Darfur. The book Another Man's War, the feature film Machine Gun Preacher and the upcoming documentary film will touch your heart in some fashion. Gerard Butler does a terrific job portraying both the old and new Sam. The Machine Gun Preacher DVD will be my gift for Christmases and birthdays for the next several years.
B004S699K4|5.0|This verison of Halloween H20 is a great deal.  It is a widescreen verison that actually fits the TV no picture is missing.  Ive had the widescreen VHS and DVD and nothing compares to this one.  The BLURAY is DTS 2.0 granted that is not lossless audio but is sounds great if you have a good TV or sound system.  I love watching Halloween H20 this way.  I hope in the feture that the company gets 4 and 5 on Bluray
1439156816|5.0|King gets it.  He knows how to write an engaging autobiography.  When he recalls life events, he does it with humor and wit.  When he tells you how to write, he knows what works and what does not.  Most of all, King knows honesty.  If you give a damn about honest writing, read this book.  If you're a writer, read it again.  Also, anyone who appreciates John Prine's lyrics is a genius.  King does.  This book?  Go for it.
B001M4YZ90|3.0|These are well known actors and that's why I went ahead and purchased \\"Rock n Rolla\\". It looked like a really good movie after seeing it on a preview of a different movie. Horrible choice. Don't waste your money!
B0015AARJI|5.0|At this point there isn't much to say about the PS3 controller. Its almost identical to the PS1/2 controllers.  PROS  -The trigger buttons are improved. They are a lot springier.  -Seems lighter  -Strong rumble  -Long battery life (plus the battery just lasts forever)  -Wireless is great...the range and connection quality is outstanding  CONS  -Takes a while to charge  -The PS button keeps getting hit by accident, I wish there could be a different spot for it
0385344325|4.0|As always Lee Child does a marvelous job on this book, was really working to see who was the villain in this book. I would recommend this to anyone .
0716748789|3.0|Got this textbook for my Inorganic lab class. It's an alright book, but there are many errors and it seems like the authors ramble on in some places and don't explain things too well. It may be easier to use for people who have a better understanding of inorganic chemistry, but I found it kind of difficult to follow.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This is a movie in the vein of The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen.  It's a story within a story.  In the main story, an injured man and a girl are in the hospital together, and the injured man is telling the girl a story.  The images conjured up by the story for the viewer are truly extraordinary and reflect the director's truly unique vision and style.  Shot on location primarily in India, the outdoor settings are so extraordinary as to appear computer-generated but are mostly real.  This movie deserves to be seen in high-def on a big screen.  Enjoy it.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|A fan since the beginning - this is a welcome addition to the collection.  I wasn't terribly impressed with Vida - it was a step down from X&Y which I consider their best.  Here, although there is an inconsistency of pace, sound and theme in this album which other reviewers have noticed - it all somehow works, even the Rihanna (puke puke) duet.  My favorite track -- did anyone notice Hurts Like Heaven? It jumps out at you right at the start - very catchy, mood shifting to optimism. Like a cup of strong espresso just when you need it.
B005NJ2K6U|2.0|I was able to get through the first two levels then when I got to the Caribbean level, it kept freezing up my phone. I can't access the task manager to force close so then I am stuck pulling out the battery to reboot. Hopefully a patch is sent out soon. Samsung Galaxy S Captivate.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Sit back and relax ... don't worry to much about the storyline or other flawed..  Just chill out, get entertain and be marveled at the huge amount of state of the art special effects thrown into this movie.  A must have for an ultimate family get together entertainment...
B004I2K4DY|5.0|It brings me to tears every time I see this special 25th Anniversary! The cast is amazing. Highly recommend it to anyone that loves this incredible production.
B0052P5DIC|5.0|let me strongly second mr cohen`s statement about the packaging.one of the live discs had visible scratches,although it played fine.other than that,great music at a very appealing price for all that music.
B004I8WD7S|3.0|I love the case itself, but the sticker on the screen protector (the little one with instruction) left a mark on the screen protector itself. And that makes it very much useless.  But for $8.99, it is a good case.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm so glad this was an AOTD when it was or I may not have ever tried it. The prediction is unbelievable at this point. I mean, it worked really well from the start, but it learns as you go. So, now I hardly type more than one or two letters for each word. Many times the word I was going to type next is already there before I type anything!  Awesome keyboard!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I was very surprised to see an office suite for Amazon's free app of the day. I'll admit I was skeptical at first, but after downloading it and trying it out, I was amazed at how well this works. Try it if you don't believe me. You won't be sorry.
B000S46QOM|4.0|I had this record back in the day and somehow misplaced it.  So I wanted to get another one.  I have not played it yet because I need to hook up my record player.  That being said the album cover is in pretty good shape and the records appear in playable condition.  There was no sleeve for one of the records.  I think it was a great purchase so far.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|This album is everything you would expect from Kelly: energetic, fantastic vocal work, aggressive lyrics and catchy jams.  Every song gets better and better each time I listen to this album.  I REALLY enjoyed \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" and was hoping that this record would at least be CLOSE to to AIEW... \\"Stronger\\" is just as strong and awesome in it's own right.  Good job Kelly!!!! Thanks boo boo!!!! :)
B005D0RDKW|4.0|I saw the Blu-Ray of this show last night.  This was projected using a Panasonic theater-grade projector (the logo came up before the showtime) and the Blu Ray was the consumer version that will be released in December (I know this because the menu came up before the showtime).  This review will be based on what I saw, and since I have no control over how that theater calibrated their projector, I cannot say with certainty if any of the flaws were due to the Blu Ray itself, or the projector/sound system.  But here goes.  Sound-wise, things don't start out that impressively, but get progressively better as the show progressed.  At first the sound was a bit flat in terms of dynamics and a bit soft.  The bass lacked punch, and I didn't feel like I was at the show, but watching a show.  The sound was clean, I could hear no feedback or hiss, and I could hear the spaces between the sounds.  Eventually the sound mixers at the concert must have made some corrections because the sound improved from \\"okay\\" to \\"very good\\", at least for a live concert.  There wasn't any obnoxious use of sound imaging, just some ambient crowd noise, nothing flying from one speaker to the next.  Instrumentally, Geddy's bass and Alex's guitars sounded the best--dynamic, never shrill or piercing.  Solos aside, Neil's drums were just a tad undermixed--perhaps this was intentional as his drumming style can be so dominant.  Overall, the sound level definitely got louder and louder as the concert progressed--several people remarked on it after the show.    Picture wise this was excellent, but with a definite bias towards blue overall.  Flesh tones looked as natural as they can under the \\"limelight\\".  I saw no evidence of edge enhancement or processing, this was probably just directly loaded from the HD cameras without much interference.  Some of the longest shots (and the occasional \\"blimp\\" shot) were of slightly lesser picture quality, but this could have more to do with the slow build-up of smoke inthe venue.  The opening and end credits were of low quality and jagged edges were visible.  The non-concert film clips were pretty much perfect, with some minor smearing during intentionally hokey special effects segments involving the time machine tranformations.    Overall, this was an exciting, involving show that had the theater crowd cheering along with the projected crowd.  The sound started out iffy but steadily improved to very good.  The picture is likely the best we have seen in a Rush concert so far.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|The tyrannosaurus is remarkably well done, hand painted, incredible detail. The digital copies are fantastic (i downloaded them for iPod) Even the box is beautiful. Oh! and includes the firsth chapter of the game free! is awazome!  i have to update my review, altough i loved the bundle with the collectable and all it gives the buyer i must say i love it when i tried it on my ps3, of course when i went and buy the hdmi cable it was much much much different. there IS A SAND LIKE trough all the movie... yet it is only noticible from about 1 feet or less from the screen from the normal viewing point the movie looks great no comparison with the DVD the bluray is fantastic, but if you have your sit quite close you will notice the sandy look..
1451648537|4.0|This book made me cry in some places. I found it hard to put down. I only wished it included more of Steve's last few weeks / days of life and his interactions with his family.
B00466HM28|5.0|It's just dope!!!!! And I can't wait until I get the update. I wanted to try this out first, now I'm going to get it soon.
B002ZG99N6|1.0|Here we have a movie attempting to make \\"heroes\\" out of criminals.  It tries to make people feel pity and sorry for the choices criminals make and seems to justify their selfish behaviors.  Everyone has sad stories though people who aren't criminals obviously have more integrity and honor than criminals and are more fit to make movies about.  Glorifying and romanticizing criminals is not responsible to the culture and kids unless that's what you want kids to become.  As a side note I have worked with adolescents in prison and they love this movie as well as others so I decided to watch it and understand it justifies their selfish bad behaviors instead of them making choices that better themselves and others.
0385344325|4.0|I have read all of the reacher books. just finished this one. Good. better than one where he talked to the old lady in the house for 200 pages.  Of course he performed the obligatory head butt. Twice. Always look forward to that. Not sure how Tom Cruise will do that in the movie. \\"could you hold on till I drag this chair over here?\\"  Kindle has that great feature where you can search for a word and I just had a crazy feeling I might get a few hits on the word, Coffee.  52!! I am not making that up.It might be a Reacher record.  Reacher should be spending half of his time in the bathroom in these books. It also explains his poor sleeping habits and maybe is the key to understanding his preternatural  ability to always know the correct time like a human version of phoning \\"popcorn\\".The  older demographic  will get that. Maybe the time thing is not a good thing-just his brain telling him to lighten up on the caffeine. you think?
0545265355|5.0|My purchase of The Hunger Games trilogy box set didn't take long at all to arrive and of course came in excellent condition! I enjoyed reading the books and plan on reading them again before the first movie comes out in March!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Would be good, except that it can't open documents in other apps.  That's a deal breaker for me as I use a cloud print app to print documents.  For now, I'll stick with  QuickOffice that came on my phone; it supports opening in other apps.
1451648537|4.0|This is worth the read, for sure. It gives me more insight into Steve Jobs than I have ever had. But, I think it stopped short. I really wanted to get further inside his head and understand his motivations and how he ticked. Unfortunately, the book is more heavy on Apple and Silicon Valley history than the motivations and inner struggles of the man himself.  I'd gotten the impression from seeing Steve on-screen years ago that he was a self-important jerk (I'm not a follower). This book confirms my suspicions more than I could have ever imagined. Many times the author doesn't condone or sympathize with this behavior. But, at the same time, he does seem to condone or revel in it too sometimes, which is disturbing. Right off the bat, we hear about a very young Steve whose strong-willed and bratty behavior causes those around him (mostly his parents) to \\"bend their wills\\" to Steve's. The author really drives this home, with an almost adoring tone. This eventually gives way to Steve openly revealing that he is much smarter than his parents and \\"special\\", no doubt constantly reinforced by his parents. We all grew up with a kid like this, or may even have one in our own families, the one who thought they were better than everyone else, the one who never was put in there place and realized that they were no more important or \\"special\\" than anyone else. At this point in the book, the author seems really caught up in Steve and doesn't see the behavior for what it is, spoiled and unchecked. This spoiled Young Steve no doubt sets the stage for Adult Steve's continued bad behavior, and I think since he found success so young, he never had to learn to fit in to society like the rest of us do. Fame and fortune seemed to make this excusable. But the author's tone in describing this left a bad taste for me early in the book and caused some eye rolling. (It did get better).  What was here about Steve's entrepreneurial drive and focus on design was fascinating. I really identify withSteve's respect and pursuit of craftsmanship and his focus on aesthetics and design, as well as his burning desire to build a great company. Those same things drive me.  As far as the writing goes, I think if the author had worked at Apple, Jobs would have fired him and said this book \\"sucks\\", as he would often say. I was amazed that the book would flow so well in parts, talking about something in Steve's life then spin 180 degrees in another direction, like Valley history, then Steve's estranged daughter, etc. Pretty scattered. The author also annoyingly refers to Steve's wife by her last name only, \\"Powell\\", throughout most of the book, even after not mentioning her for many pages. Other people get the full name treatment often, but not her. Odd.   All in all, I get the sense that this book was in a draft stage, then was rushed out after Steve died to capitalize on the timing. It's good, but could have been better.
B004EJUMT2|1.0|...which doesn't help this album much at all. Overhyped band which does not interest me at all. Avoid unless you read Metalsucks and enjoy it.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This OfficeSuite Pro app works well for opening and editing MS Office documents. This program crashed on my HTC EVO 4G (Android 2.3.3) and indicated an \\"App Store Error\\". Multiple uninstall and reinstall attempts produced the same results but doing a reset of my EVO by pulling the battery cleared up the problem.<br /><br />The app works with all of the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents that I tested (we use [[ASIN:B00337D8U6 Microsoft Office 2010 Home & Student (Disc Version)]]). While I wouldn't want to do a lot of editing on my little EVO screen, this app does make it possible to create, view, and makes changes. The interface is fairly intuitive and easy to work with, which makes this app a keeper.<br /><br />Recommended! Note that this was an Amazon \\"Free App of the Day\\", but would likely pay the asking price.<br /><br />CFH
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|Don't get me wrong.  I really liked this game till I got to the Caribbean....  Then it said that to continue in must download files from the game server...  Sorry, but will not load files to my phone unless I know exactly what they are for...  since I could not find a reason to load them, I feel a little suspicious about the whole thing...  So I am uninstalling, even though I really like the game...
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I discovered this band via Pandora - and this album did not disappoint.  Although this band has that distinctive MMJ sound - they are more quirky and soulful (but still rock).  Love it- buy it!

0446585025|5.0|Two days ago I was delayed at LAX for 3 hours !!   Lucky for me at the last moment I put Ellen's book in my backpack.  Although you never want to be delayed at an airport, if you are and you have Ellen's book its not so bad.  Although many people were looking at me like I was a crazy person sitting alone laughing out loud.  Ellen has a way of telling a story to get the message across and make you laugh.  Ellen you are an American Treasure.
B005BDZN62|5.0|the combining of all prior reviews of earlier releases of \\"West Side Story\\" with the blu-ray release, so it will be impossible to find reviews of the blu-ray as to quality and value.   The five stars are solely for the film.  There have been numerous complaints about the combining of reviews; but Amazon is clearly not interested in correcting that process.  And the fact of being customers is irrelevant as concerns such complaints.  Rude is as rude is.
0385344325|1.0|With this novel, Lee Child officially joins the ranks of authors such as John Sanford, Jeffery Deaver, Dean Koontz, Jonathan Kellerman, etc... that is, \\"writers I used to buy in hardcover as soon as they came out, but have reluctantly given up on after enduring years of their lackluster novels.\\" Mr. Child, you need to give it a break, sir. You've written a lot of good books, but lately, I'm sorry to say, the stories have not been up to par. The descriptions of mundane objects used to be sort of interesting, but lately they're simply tiresome. For instance, this is your third book in a row where you talked about the cambers of roads. Also, the plots have weakened and many of your devices are starting to repeat themselves. Also, the sex scenes in this book were way too long, boring, and just plain weird. Here's a thought - perhaps you could imbue Reacher with some character flaws, or a change of situation, or an altered outlook. Once, long ago, Superman lost half his powers, but he remained interesting, and his predicament led to some interesting story lines. Oh, and by the way, count me among those who are ticked off that you gave the okay to have little Tommy Cruise play Reacher.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|It isn't a bad book.  I read it in less than a day, and I enjoyed reading it.  The editing is a bit lax; in one part the 'bad' drug is said to cause aortic valve damage, in another part, mitral valve damage, both leading to decreased valve regurgitation (any degree of valve regurgitation is abnormal).  Don't expect too much from it, and you'll have many hours of entertainment.

1400052173|4.0|Research is very important in the medical field.  Blood and other tissues taken from a patient have mostly been discarded, or in rare circumstances used for research.  In the past, no one thought twice about this.  However, in even rarer circumstances, a lot of money has been made from these \\"donated\\" tissues.  This book explores the contrasts between the medical break throughs (and profit)coming from the \\"donated\\" tissue of Henrietta Lacks and the loss of privacy and continued poverty of her family.  The book is very thought provoking as medical ethics continue to evolve in the field of medical research.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|There's plenty of coverage already on how unique and well-done this 'delightfully enjoyable for all ages' animated fantasy is! Dittoes from me... I'll just add my thanks to my twenty-something son for 'turning me on to' this wonder!  I was (belatedly) raving about how unexpectedly good Rattatouille (sp?) was when he highly recommended this. He was so right! I will be buying a copy to watch again (and again).
B00009VQK5|5.0|The cost of this film breaks down to $1 a shot, so be ready to take quality shots every time. Using this film with a Polaroid Land Camera 440 (no flash, indoor lighting) and it works beautifully.  Chemicals get a bit messy if you're not careful, but that's more a user issue than a product issue.
B005I64U5C|1.0|The movie is very good. However the ultraviolet/Flixster digital copy system is so poorly designed that it useless.  It is unnecessarily complicated You cannot download a permanent copy to any device. Steaming is ok but you rack up charges on your data limits. As  said, it is not iTunes compatible. I will not purchase any movie with this system again
B0053YGYO4|4.0|It's so different than past Coldplay, but it sounds like they've always sounded this way. It sounds like nothing they've done before, but it fits right in with everything they've done before.
1439192812|5.0|Magic of Reality was such a delightful read that I had a difficult time putting it away. Though I was aware of most of the scientific principles explained in the book, it was still very rewarding to get a new perspective on them, especially through the absolutely fantastic illustrations and some of the fabulous thought experiments. A must read for kids and their parents alike.  Swami
B005JU5JTI|1.0|There was nothing fun or funny about this movie (I knew the reviews weren't good, but I thought there had to be at least some enjoyable parts -- I was wrong).  There was no chemistry between Cameron and the PE teacher.  I couldn't tell if Justin T's character was that ridiculous or if it was just really poor acting.  There were zero likeable characters and no character development.  From watching the movie, I had no understanding as to why the main character was so nasty to everyone.  Did something happen to her as a child?  A little background would be nice.  Overall, pointless.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I went back and forth for weeks trying to decide which headset I wanted, I had it narrowed down to the CoDMW3 Delta, the XP 500 (same set as the Delta, just cheaper and sans the CoD swag,) and the X41. I ultimately decided on the X41 because it has most of the same features of the Delta but at a considerably smaller price. I am only a casual gamer and mostly wanted a headset so that I would not wake up my son when I played. I altered my connections so that I can also listen to my TV and BluRay player through the headset, and the transmitter is powered by the USB on my TV as opposed to the XBOX.  I do have two complaints, first is a low level \\"hiss\\" in the headset but this is probably do to my wireless setup in the house, second complaint is the ear cup shape. The ear cups are round, not oval, so my big ears are a bit outside the cups and I actually have to tuck the top and bottom of my ear into the cup. It's still very comfortable to wear with plenty of padding and air flow.

B003GDYN24|5.0|I've been listening to this CD for few months now and it is simply stunning! Oddly enough this is an electro-pop album yet it sounds extremely original and modern. It is difficult to find a recent comparable album, but if I had to choose I'd say Kanye West's 808s and Heartbreak could be viewed as a companion piece, with the obvious caveat that Kanye's lyrics are subpar, whereas Kelis is actually a very good lyricist. It is also hard to pick a favorite as all songs are just excellent. 4th of July is outstanding, Home has a kick-@$$ beat, Brave is a gem. Very well done Kelis!!!

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I haven't purchased any music outside in a 'real' store for years. It's been<br />\\"Always Amazon\\" I go to for my selections. They arrive fast, are pretty inexpensive and come in great small amount of packaging.<br />This CD ROM of Lady Antebellum is totally fabulous. I like the fact that I can go online and listen to nearly every song on an album... excuse me.. a CDROM to get a sense of what is on it.

B00428ZRFE|4.0|Rihanna is back with her fifth studio album Loud. And from the vivid red hair Rihanna the is displayed on the front of the album you know you in for a real head banging and foot stomp experience. While it is certainly no \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" or \\"Rated R\\" it is still in the spirit of both of them album as every song on here is connected in some way and that way is loud and up and move your body and sing along music.  The album opens with the brash in your face \\"S&M\\" with it's killer beats and vocals serves as excellent intro for the album.  Track three which also displays the characteristic loudness of album \\"Cheers (Drink to That) which contains an interpolation of Avril Lavinge's \\"With You\\" is an excellent song to sing very loudly in a bar too.  Other tracks that makes this album very good is her first single from the album \\"Only Girl in the World\\" and and her sequel to \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" which also feature vocal by Eminem. The very dramatic \\"Man Down\\" which contains elements of her Caribbean upbringing. Also the very soft and delicate \\"Love the Way Lie Part II (Piano Verison) which cuts out Eminem. The only song on here that it could have done without is the Drake assisted \\"Whats My Name\\" with<br />It's very annoying na nas.
B002VH7P4O|4.0|It's been a two week journey both to get a working apple and then get the FLAC files in shape to hear on my stereo. If you want to know how I did this, read further and I might save you some long and sleepless nights.    1. Getting the Apple  I ordered the little USB apple from Amazon after reading about how great this little thing was. The apple arrived intact, stem and all and I was thrilled. That was short lived however after I found that the USB was defective. Nothing showed up on two computers and two other electronic devices. Amazon refunded the money in a jiffy and I found a used one (the new ones were gone by now) through their warehouse. I had it delivered in two days. When I opened the box, to my horror the little apple box inside the package was smashed in on one side even though the shipping box was fine. (Hmm, UPS reboxed maybe? It was not in a smiley Amazon box) Even though the little black box was badly damaged, the apple inside was fine and this time it worked!    2. Playing on the Computer, iPod  The USB comes with two full sets of music files, mp3 and FLAC. On my PC (Windows XP) I could not use the little button they talk about in the included read me file to transfer the files to iTunes. I had to do this manually. All I had to do my drag the mp3 files into the iTunes library, then transfer them to my iPod. Everything went fine, all is there, album art and all.    As for the FLAC files, they would not play on the computer, but I downloaded Winamp a free program and it plays them no problem. Boy did they sound good on my pair of Bose computer speakers, but that was not enough for me, oh no, I wanted to play them on my stereo [evil laugh here].    3. Playing on my Stereo (Read only if you are brave)  Well there's a lot of technical stuff I slogged through on the internet during my week long journey to figure out how to get these great loss-less files to work on my stereo. If you'd like to take that adventure this is a good place to start: [...]    Without getting into all that mumbo jumbo and trial and error, here is what I did that worked. WARNING! You have to spend MORE MONEY!! (If you are super tech savvy you can probably figure out a free way that is ten times the work)    -Convert your FLAC files to (24 bit-lossless --the same) 48kHz WAV files using dBpoweramp's Audio Conversion software.[...]/ $38 (FLAC files will not play on a DVD or CD player.) Video DVD players play only 48 or 96 kHz, not 44kHz) The FLAC files are 24 bit 44.1 kHz.    -Make an audio VIDEO DVD using Audio DVD Creator. [...]$39.95. CD players will not play 24 bit files. The biggest is 16 bit and it won't sound as good. If you have an AUDIO DVD player you can use AUDIO DVD software. Explained: [...]    4. If all this is too much trouble I think you can buy an NBOX 2nd or 3rd generation media player to connect to your entertainment system. It should play your FLAC files right off the USB. I said should. I don't know for sure. You should research that. NBOX 2nd Gen is around $40 on Amazon. The 3rd is even more.    BOTTOM LINE. Yes, this was a PAIN! But............ When I finally got to hear the white album on my stereo, using my DVD player, I almost cried, the quality was soooooooo good. I have a CD of the same album and it sounds flat in comparison.  The converted FLAC files sound life-like, organic, real! Like others say, you can hear things you've never heard before. You will feel like the Beatles are in the room with you --yes, that good. Well, if you have pretty good speakers.    The four stars instead of five are because of the extreme hassle the USB FLAC files are to play.    You may want to go into the discussions about this product, lots of good info there, and confusing. But if you are gonna get the USB, you really should know what to do with it when you get it.

B00192IV9U|3.0|Micheal which is Micheal Jackson's first posthumous release from Epic Records. The album is a complitan of completed and incompleted works from the 1980s intil  his death in 2009. For the most part  the album sounds incohesive and rushed, and is by far the weakest Jackson release that Sony or Motown ever put out. The album boast few enjoyable tracks and it suffers from a really lackluster opener as well. I found that only three of the ten tracked listing to be par with Jackson's standards for an album. \\"Hollywood Tonight\\" sound like a leftover from the \\"Invincible\\" studio sessions and features production from longtime collabrotor Teddy Riley and a spoken interlude from nephew Taryll Jackson; it is easily the best track on here. \\"Monster\\" which features rapper 50 Cent is also killer track and sounds like a typical Jackson collaboration with some of the previous rappers that he ha worked in the past; but of note it sounds as if Curtis Jackson's vocals where added by Sony after his death. And the last great track on here is \\"Behind the Mask\\" which a cover of Japanese synth pop band Yellow Magic Orchestra and includes additional lyrics by Jackson and was originally recorded in 1982 for inclusion on sixth studio \\"Thriller\\". Overall Sony could have done a lot better with the release and feature posthumous albums.
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|I'm in love with this album! Their breakout hit song, Pumped Up Kicks is amazing, but you should definitely listen to the rest of the album as well. Each song has it's own addictive quality. I just play them over and over and don't get sick of them. It's so refreshing to see a new band that is so different. I can't wait to hear more from them! Also, the band members are pretty attractive, so that's another plus. Haha! I highly recommend this album. It gives me hope for the music of today. <3

B0053YGYO4|5.0|These guys continue to remind me why they are my favorite band. To those who don't like the album, it's cool. I understand. It's different. But, to say that it's awful doesn't make sense. Bands are supposed to evolve and grow. Doing the same thing over and over becomes boring. I love the new sound. To the others that haven't yet heard it, but wish to purchase it, do so. I don't think you'll be disappointed. If you are, they shouldn't stop being one of your favorites. After all, there are much worse \\"bands\\", \\"musicians\\" and \\"artists\\" out there. And, you know I'm not lying about that.

B002JVWR4A|5.0|I have been a fan of 'Bones' since the very beginning, and while there were some things about this season that I did not like, it was overall a great season to watch. The cases and bodies were always a spectacular sight, although it sometimes felt that the character drama overshadowed the outcome of a case. (In some episodes, it seemed as if the evidence that solved the case was hastily thrown together.) The dynamics between the main characters - Bones and Booth, Angela/Hodgins/Wendell, Cam/Michelle - were especially interesting to watch. I also really enjoyed the rotation of the interns, who always added a bit of levity to the show. I'm also a nerd in that I watch the bonus features included in the set, such as: bonus/extended scenes, gag reel, and behind the scenes footage. (All extra features are funny and interesting!) Season 5 is definitely a great buy, and I would suggest every 'Bones' fan add it to their collection!
1423140591|5.0|My daughter and I enjoyed this second book of this series.  It was a bit slow to start, introducing a whole new set of characters.  Since it had been a while we had to review the last book a bit to put us back on track.  The new characters nicely fit the story line - Romans vs Greeks and coming together to defeat a common enemy.<br /><br />I did feel they overused Arion a bit to slow/speed up the storyline.  I would have been OK to lengthen the quest and use \\"normal\\" transportation methods.  Felt it was a bit rushed.<br /><br />The cliffhanger ending was a bit frustrating, but I understand the stopping point.  My daughter screamed on the last page wanting Percy to re-unite with his camp-half blood colleagues.  Well its only a year or so to the next book...<br /><br />I do recommend all of Rick Riordan book series as they are fun and enjoyable.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|It has been a long time since I have seen this show, and I was very excited to find the entire series set for such a good price. The dvd case is also very compact and does not take up much room. Now all I have to do is sit back and enjoy the best of Al Bundy.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|I put off starting this book because I thought it might not hold my interest.  It turned out to be a wonderful book that weaves the life of Grace a servant at Riverton alongside Hannah the daughter of her employer back in the 1920's. The book takes place in England contrasting the lives of these two women and is told from the perspective of Grace who is now in her 90's. The story meanders from present to past and uncovers several secrets that have been kept hidden.
B002UZCJP2|5.0|With storytelling better than Blade Runner, it gives the feel of a 70's movie at times (similar to Westworld/Logan's Run), without all the distracting CGI that's becoming common place in movies today. Well directed with a great cast of talented actors, topped by a superb performance from Bruce Willis. A real surprise that's become one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies, due to its' totally human story.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|This CD is one of the most distorted & compressed CD's ever made.  It's just a big fuzzy mess.  It's impossible to appreciate the music when the sound is so annoying.  They have engaged the most successful mastering engineers in the world and if they didn't ruin this thing at the mastering stage, then the mixes came in pre-ruined.    I'm gonna guess the mixes were a mess out of the studio or the garage or the bedroom they mixed them in and then they had the mastering engineers just step on it one more time, real hard to finish off any life that the music might have had.  The sound-stage is one big fuzzy Mexican radio station.  It is SO compressed that as it gets louder it actually gets softer, you can hear the compressor pumping and trying to recover from it being over driven.  Something in the chain of electronics is also distorted along the way.  Too bad with all the technology we have today that a record from 1965 will sound SO much better both acoustically and musically.  These guys have sold out big time.  Too bad.  Maybe they will wake up and redo the record and put our Version II:  The listenable version.

B004R739LE|4.0|The Lowepro LP36329 Orion DayPack 200 is a vice nice \\"daypack\\" that can be used for carrying a moderate sized photo kit plus some other essentials.  The relatively inexpensive price is a plus.<br /><br />The Orion DayPack 200 is constructed of nylon; there are flaps covering the two main zippers of the bag to lend some protection from rain, but there is no built-in weatherproof cover like in some more expensive backpacks.  And as mentioned in other reviews, there is no \\"quick access\\" feature; you'll need to take off the backpack / unclip / unzip to get to your camera and lenses.<br /><br />(SEE ATTACHED PICTURE)<br /><br />The camera compartment makes up the bottom part of the bag; it is well padded and comes with five dividers which can be used to partition the camera compartment as needed.  I was able to fit my Canon 50D with attached 15-85mm lens, plus a Canon 135L lens, Sigma 50mm f1.4 lens, and Canon 430EX II flash into the compartment and still have a bit of room left over for a spare battery / charger / filter or two.  My only real complaint is that Lowepro was quite optimistic in its specs for the camera compartment.  It states that the interior camera compartment is 6.9\\"H, but my Canon 50D / 15-85mm combo which measured at 6.25\\" high barely fits, and a Canon 70-200 f4L IS at 6.8\\" long will definitely not fit in the camera compartment.  It also would have been nice to have a zipper / Velcro pocket somewhere for filters / memory cards.<br /><br />The top half of the Orion DayPack 200 is basically a large open compartment.  There is a mesh pocket against the back of this that can keep a few items separate; there is some elastic holding the top of this pocket but no zipper.  There is no padding for the top half of the bag, so any lenses carried there (like my 70-200) should be stored in their protective case.  I would also use the top compartment to carry lens hoods, water, and anything else you might need to carry for your day trip.  In addition there are two long but narrow zippered pockets on the outside of the top part of the bag that could be used for keys, cell phones, or other small items; these zippered compartments have no extra protection from the weather.<br /><br />Lastly, the bottom of the bag has two straps that can be used to carry a small tripod, rolled up blanket or jacket, or whatever else you can think of.<br /><br />Overall, I am impressed with the Orion DayPack 200.  It's probably not the correct choice for serious camping / backpacking duty, but it will work fine for carrying a moderate amount of photo gear and other stuff for day trips, and it's price is reasonable considering it's usefulness and quality.<br /><br />EDIT APRIL 2012 - I just used this bag for a trip to the Grand Canyon and Red Rock country in Arizona.  Took a 50D with 24-105L, 430 EX flash, 70-300L, and extra batteries / chargers / etc.  The 50D with 24-105L is a bit tall when stored vertically, but no issues closing the bag and no ill effect to the camera or lens being carried like this.  Everything else fit fine in the bottom compartment, leaving plenty of room in the top for water / snacks / maps.  I agree with other reviews that it would be nice to have a side zipper to get the camera out quicker.  That said I still really like this bag.long but narrow zippered pockets on the outside of the top part of the bag that could be used for keys, cell phones, or other small items; these zippered compartments have no extra protection from the weather.<br /><br />Lastly, the bottom of the bag has two straps that can be used to carry a small tripod, rolled up blanket or jacket, or whatever else you can think of.<br /><br />Overall, I am impressed with the Orion DayPack 200.

0307279189|5.0|Read this months ago but I am finally getting around to commenting on it. First, it is a good and very interesting read . As a former runner I was fascinated by the distances and endurances commented on here. Second, I was amazed by the comparison of various animal distance capabilities with that of humans. A terrific explanation is given for why this is so. I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />After reading it, I began exercising with sandals. Be careful about this - I developed plantar fasciitis shortly thereafter.
0060763280|5.0|I have been reading and applying different motivational authors principles lately. Grant Cardone, Dan Kennedy, Tim Ferris, Donald Keough, Napoleon Hill to name a few.  I get something out of everyting that I read. I came across this book as it was mentioned in a blog I was reading and I do not remember which one. But I can tell you I will never forget the information that is in this book. There is no smoke and mirrors or anything that is completely out there. In Secrets of the Millionare Mind I have found a true shift in my thinking about money, debt, wealth and wealth creation. Many of the ideas and concepts I was aware of but were validated and explained in a lighearted way but with deep understanding. I belive that because I have been looking in this area for a while that I see the common denominators of what many authors say. But what I enjoyed and found most useful wiht Mr Eker is his practical down to earth examples of application that I could start to do right away. I would like to tell you that I became wealthy right away, but it does not work that way. I do believe that I was ready for this book and that the information came to me at the right time and the use of these principles will help me and my family keep and invest exponentially better than we have up to this point. The information is worth far more than its cost and would recommend this book to anyone that is ready for having more money.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I can't say I've tested every feature of this headset.<br />I haven't been playing games with surround sound elements, or really tried to compare audio quality.<br /><br />Its got a good strong feel, I know in the pictures it looks plastic.  The headset has plastic over a metal frame.  The headset feels substantial.  It is not light, but nor is it heavy enough to be a hindrance.<br /><br />I have used it for voice chat extensively.  What I can tell you is that for this purpose its great.  The wireless has some of the best range I've ever seen.  The quality of my voice, and that of others is spot on.  The charge lasts a good long while.  The recharge cable is ample in length and the headset CAN be re-charged while being used.<br /><br />---Update---<br />So after using this a few months I noticed a problem.<br />I would start to hear a faint buzz, which would increase in volume until it was the only thing I heard.<br />Now, I run this headset plugged in whenever I use it.<br />The only way to fix this problem, is to turn off the headset for 10 minutes or so while it charges.  Then try it again.<br /><br />It is an extremely annoying problem.  I do not know if.. the headset is running out of battery, or what the cause is.  I have to say, if I knew about this problem I may not have bought it.  Otherwise the quality and construction of the headset is great.<br />The audio is great.  This is it's sole problem, but its a highly annoying one.

0446547654|5.0|I had pre-ordered \\"The Best Of Me\\", and received it six days ago. Sadly, I finished it one day ago.   Nicolas Sparks seems to have the ability to know about all the stages of love, and that it can occur at all ages. Dawson is a strong, flawed, but sympathetic man. He has been searching for over twenty years, but is not certain what he is looking for. Accompanied by a mysterious man that seems to appear when Dawson is in grave danger, he returns to his hometown at the request of the attorney handling the last wishes of Dawson's old friend. The friend had also requested the presence of Amanda, a woman that had been very important to Dawson's past. Together they fulfill the last wishes of Tuck, an elderly man that filled some of the empty spaces in their lives. Dawson's cousins are a foreboding cloud that hangs over what should have been a weekend filled with reminisces, closure, and perhaps hope for their future. Amanda has three children and a husband with an alcohol problem waiting for her back home. And Dawson has to come to grips with an accident that occurred many years before.   The author's love for his home state is shown in the beautifully descriptive phrases he uses to draw us into the story. And he allows us to imagine that we are right there on the porch with Amanda and Dawson, enjoying the flowers that Tuck had planted so lovingly for his wife, Clara. We are also able to comprehend the fear, anxiety, and pain that the cousins bring to everyone that knows them. A little more graphic than the others Sparks has written, it is another 'keeper' for our re-reading pleasure.

1451648537|5.0|The 60 minutes interview aired on Oct 23, 2011 was a good introductory on the life of Steve Jobs.<br />While I have known some people who worked with him and understand how he transformed the life, I know nothing about his personal life.<br /><br />It is amazing how the publisher get this book printed out in such a hurry. I am sure there are discrepancies and errors in the 656 page book. But lets focus on the basics.<br /><br />A successful corporation has to have a visionary.  Jobs certainly was the right man. He focused on a simple vision to make a good product. In the earlier 80s he was fighting against PC giants like IBM and Gates O/S, he fended both of them well by a relatively young company. Most other companies there were chaotic struggle fighting for control of power not to mention executives love to garage sale divisions which took years to formulate. The hostile takeover has long ever effects on the employees.<br /><br />The book dealt with earlier familiar days with John Scully and trouble that there were way too many projects that almost brought Apple down. Having been in Silicon Valley so long I can relate big corporations like Google, Oracle, Yahoo all followed the same path.  Apple certainly followed Jobs visionary to make it one of the most successful corporations in modern America! Apple CEO needed not to woo Wall Street since it exceeded the projections in all areas. Jobs had the rare opportunity to focus on product details and followed his vision to perfection. Tim Cook certainly was an excellent right operation executive.<br /><br />At IBM, Thomas Watson preached \\"THINK\\" and \\"keep it simple\\". The big blue executives are the first ones to throw them away which had a disastrous impact on the Valley.  THINK and keep it simple are very much what Jobs pursued in his own way.<br /><br />The financial success at Apple was merely a validation of Job's vision and flawless execution of a byproduct. He integrated or improved a neumber of new technologies. Mouse, proprietary operating systems, GUI, Zoom in and features through experimentation. He established Apple University by hiring top business professors granted he was self taught.  Unfortunately, he applied his experimental style on his own health also. His rare cancer was treatable had he not apply his self-healing method wasted 9 months on acupuncture, bowel cleansing, and herbal remedies.<br /><br />Having lived in the Valley I have the opportunity to actually witnessed transformations of what the technology changed.  I have met some Apple former executives ousted and experienced what the lack of vision and greed caused the demise of corporate America. I kept witnessing my old work places turned into a mall, Costco or Home Depot.  I still try to follow my vision tried to get something done before it is time to go!<br /><br />I have to admit I am not done with Issacson's book yet. This is an easy book to read and follow. In each chapter there is a subtle message. To fulfill one's destiny, one has to follow his dream. Many have no vision at all. In the case of Jobs, there is not enough time to do more of what he wanted to accomplish in his short 56 years of life. That is sad.<br /><br />He is truly a remarkable man of this era. For most of us there is still time left for us.  We can also accomplish our own missions.<br /><br />Sam Shueh<br />Digital Librariand features through experimentation.

0307454541|4.0|This review is just for the condition of the book, which came from Amazon's warehouse. The corners were kinda bent out shape. Enough so that I had to stack heavier books on top of it in order for it not to look as if someone stretched it out for fun.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|It's hard to describe what I felt about this movie. It sort of redefined what normal society thinks of love. The ideologies about love in modern society would never accept this sort of relationship. But this movie gave a very powerful look into how love can be shared in all sorts of ways. I really loved and hated this movie at the same time. \\"I love you because in order to understand our love, you would have to turn the world upside down.\\" I think that quote is the most beautiful and lyric quote I've ever heard - even above the love quotes found in the greats like Shakespeare or Socrates. The movie itself was beautifully set. The music in the movie alone is almost work watching it for. The music along with the gorgeous cinematography make this movie a success visually. For anyone who is open-minded enough to appreciate such a deviant loving relationship for what it is (a most defined and bar-setting example of brotherly love), I wholeheartedly recommend this movie.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Wireless headsets are still a rare breed with just a handful of options to choose from, but the G930 isn't just profiting from lack of competition. It is an all around great piece of hardware that is better than any headset I've owned in nearly all ways, wireless or not. It has excellent sound and recording quality that isn't impacted by the wireless, as is common with anything using Bluetooth and most of the earlier entries in the wireless headset market.  The three buttons get the job done for navigating through music while you're adventuring in your bathroom or kitchen or whatever manner of illicit walkabout activities you're engaging in (don't go near a running microwave). Having the buttons definitely shows you their usefulness and quickly leads to the desire for a few more. Three buttons is next, previous, and pause which is the minimum amount for it to be of any use and would be greatly serviced by doubling or tripling that. Next version hopefully.  Here's where it loses the star. If it didn't kick such a plethora of asses in other ways it'd lose two stars cause this is a biggy. The joints above the earpieces are really fancy and Robocopeaque and nifty and whatever. They're also structural failure points on a headset widely reported as having a very snug fit. I'm not the most gentle with my stuff but I'm also not club-arming my stuff into walls so I'd label myself in the rough-but-within-reason range.  The elbow joint is designed with a middle small connector swivel piece which is what holds it together, and it bears the brunt of abuse. At the connection points eventually a piece of plastic clamping the three parts of the elbow together will break and you will have an elbow joint which no longer has an elbow. After the elbow is dead the only thing holding it together is the wire. Wires are not load bearing.  I bought these a year ago and around 6 months ago the left side joint had catastrophic failure as I long predicted. I triaged with an electrical tape splint that at least protected the wire and kept it serviceable. The joint is both a socket and a swivel, and the socket will still kind of allow you to keep a solid feeling to it if backed up with enough tape, but you lose all movement obviously and the headset will not fit tightly anymore.  Yesterday the right side failed in the same way. I once again triaged with electrical tape but with both sides gone it's like having giant droopy dog ears that slap against you and fall off if you look down. I triaged with even more electrical tape and created a jury rigged head mount for with a strap for my forehead and another strap that goes behind my head toward the bottom. Between the two ear cups and the straps it once again fits snug as it did before it broke.  It's still an awesome headset otherwise but it became too cumbersome to realistically keep using it. To keep it on my head requires massive amounts of electrical tape and an incredible amount of genius level tape engineering on my part. I can't simply \\"wear\\" it anymore; I have to mount and dismount it from my head like I'm suiting up to pilot a spaceship. It would be cool if I was but I'm not. I'm piloting my chair at my computer and that's not cool normally and especially not with headgear.  Anyway, I ordered a new G930 earlier today. There's no replacement on the market for it yet so my choice is between perfecting my electrical tape head mount or buying a new identical headset. I know I will blow the eblows out of this one too but at least this time I bought 60 yards of heavy duty electrical tape along with it.

034552554X|5.0|I read on the average, 3 books a week, out of all the books I have read in the last 3 years (approx 469 books) this was the most riveting. I had a hard time putting the book down and one night stayed up hours past my bedtime because I just could not stop reading.<br />If you had a perfect childhood, you probably would not feel empathy towards Victoria or find her to be a sympathetic character.<br /><br />I had a rather unhappy childhood, so I felt an instant bond with Victoria, I could understand why she would withdraw from people and reject love and kindness.<br /><br />What is really amazing is that this book is a First by the author. The past and present viewpoints alternating in the book brought a bit of mystery and the solutions for feelings and reactions and while not everyone would care for that type of storytelling, I found it made the book more enjoyable.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and if you take a chance and read it, you might find yourself delighted, or if not, you can pass the book on to a friend that might just find it to be their cup of tea.

0385333846|5.0|In the opening chapter of Slaughterhouse-Five, Kurt Vonnegut describes his service in World War II where, as a prisoner of war, he witnessed the fire bombing that destroyed the German city of Dresden, and his long struggle to write a war novel that reflected what happened. He visits a fellow POW, Bernard O'Hare, looking for a fresh perspective on the event, which he finds from O'Hare's wife. She's openly hostile to the the idea of a war novel. If it's anything like most war stories, she says, Vonnegut will cover up the carnage with glory and cast characters more like John Wayne than the children who really fought and died. Vonnegut promises he will do no such thing, and Slaughterhouse-Five is the fulfilment of that promise.<br /><br />With typical whimsy and dark humor, Vonnegut presents the life of Billy Pilgrim, a well to do optometrist from upstate New York who witnessed the destruction of Dresden as a prisoner of war and, many years later, was abducted by aliens.<br /><br />Billy has also come unstuck in time, unpredictably experiencing different episodes in his life.  The departure from linear time provides Vonnegut the opportunity to alternate between Billy's war experience, the fallout later in life, and his alien abduction. True to Mrs. O'Hare's wishes, Vonnegut's soldiers are young boys who experience war in equal parts horror and absurdity.<br /><br />Our understanding of Billy's struggle with the war - during and after - are revealed mostly through his actions. As Billy is captured and taken to Dresden he trudges along, just trying to stay alive. But Billy's erratic behavior in the years after the war reveal a deep struggle with the horrors experienced. He has a nervous breakdown, troubles his daughter, and becomes rather well known for his lectures on flying saucers and the true nature of time.<br /><br />See, in 1967 Billy was abducted by aliens and kept in a zoo on their home planet, Tralfamadore, for several years. During his abduction, Billy learned that, unlike humans who experience time moment to moment, the Talfamadorian see all things in their temporal entirety; a fixed object from birth to death. Billy goes on to preach this existential perception back on earth, and the reader is left to wonder what consolations it provided Vonnegut.<br /><br />For all the quirky science fiction and dry humor, it is Slaughterhouse-Five's deep sorrow and plea for humanity that lay at its core. It is an inevitable read for anybody invested in good literature, Vonnegut's most essential book, and like nothing else in the canon of great war novels.moment to moment, the Talfamadorian see all things in their temporal entirety; a fixed object from birth to death.

0451169514|3.0|Stephen King has always been a very derrivative writer, and in many respects the 1986 novel IT reflects his own 1982 novella \\"The Body,\\" which is better known as the film STAND BY ME--and perhaps more specifically the 1979 Peter Straub novel GHOST STORY. \\"The Body\\" tells of a group of boys who take a long walk to see the dead body of a dead child, and who must confront their own fears, various frightening accidents, and a gang of vicious bullies; GHOST STORY concerns a group of boys who find themselves terrorized by a shape-shifting spirit who returns years later to further terrorize them as adults. IT is a variation on both, but it casts a somewhat wider net: in this instance the children--six boys and one girl--confront a shape-shifting creature. From time to time this creature appears in the small Maine town of Derry, where it kills children until its thirst is slaked. Thereafter, and under the creature's influence, the town tends to forget that such murders happened ... until the next time.<br /><br />Set in a small, very ordinary town named Derry, the plot of IT is a bit complicated, for it slips back and forth between 1958 and 1985.  In the first, the seven children confront and possibly kill It; in the second the adults those children have become return to Derry when It returns, this time to kill the monster once and for all.  Both stories play out at the same time and both are parallel to each other.  The creature they refer to as It is also a complicated entity, for we are never quite certain of the scope of its powers.  It most often appears in the guise of clown, but It is also able to sense what frightens you the most and assume that appearance if that is more advantageous.  As the novel progresses we find that It is not a ghost, not a demon, not even a shape-shifter in any traditional sense of the term.  It is an inter-dimensional predator, something that might have been inspired by the creations of H.P. Lovecraft, a thing that slips between time and space to attack at will, feeding as much upon the fear it inspires as the actual bodies of its victims.<br /><br />If all this sounds good--well, it is and it isn't.  Over the years King and a host of other writers have made excessive use of child characters in their novels, and the notion was old even in 1986, when the novel was published.  King also has difficulty in making each of the seven characters distinct, particularly in the first portion of the novel, and he has a tendency to tell their stories in a sort of rota system, as if each character has been assigned a number to get a sketch in turn.  As for It, the concept plays out very well until about the last hundred pages of the novels, which define It in a surprisingly prosaic sort of way and which have a confused quality, as if King himself is not entirely sure of what It is supposed to be: monster from another dimenstion, monster from outer space, demi-god of evil, or what.  That said, King, his stories, his characters, and his style have always had a certain crassness about them.  Sometimes it works well, but sometimes it feels out of place, and where IT is concerned the latter applies--occasionally to a point where you might think about putting the novel aside for once and all.<br /><br />Even so, if you're looking for a big, splashy Stephen King horror novel--well, no, it isn't in the same league as 'SALEM'S LOT or even THE SHINING, but the book is still entertaining enough to pull you through one thousand plus pages.  One thing that helps the book be entertaining is the way in which King references his own work (Dick Hallorann from THE SHINING is mentioned, for example), and King takes specific swipes at other horror writers, most particularly Koontz.  This is probably more a book for hardcore King fans than it is for more casual readers, but if you don't expect too much, you'll likely enjoy IT.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerack at will, feeding as much upon the fear it inspires as the actual bodies of its victims.

I went to my local camera store called Eppersons_Ph0t0 and was shocked at how expensive camera bags can be. I looked around and found this one and decided, what the heck, lets see if its good. It arrived and I was impressed by the quality. No, it probably won't be better than a $180 bag but for under $35 you will not beat this deal.  If you are wanting to get a camera bag and are considering this one, I highly recommend it. The quality is good, the \\"feel\\" of the bag is nice and there is alot of padding. Stop hesitating over $35 and buy this bag. Look at all the reviews!  I'm sure they will be going up on these prices so get it while its cheap!

0316044938|2.0|The book was really fine for the first 2/3, compelling crime story was a really nice contrast with the ethereal description of heaven.

It completely ruined the story for me.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|It was not merely *one*  \\"Miracle at Philadelphia,\\" it was a series of miracles - from the explosive \\"Writs of Assistance\\" speech orated by James Otis at Faneuil Hall in Boston that inspired so many of the other Forefathers, to the victory against all odds at Yorktown before the young country to get down to business.  Although the mention of the Pre-Revolution is scant, the very soul of our Nation resonates in this excellent film.  It acknowledges and poignantly presents the personal travail and sacrifices made by these people as they gave their up their lives to the cause, either on the battlefield or in public office, which might be considered the more prolonged and agonizing of the two types of sacrifices.  Finally, the thing that was captured best in this film and which I noted with full understanding,  was the hardest part of all - the bittersweet \\"letting go\\" and returning, bruised and battered,  to the land they loved - the land worth so much of oneself.  It's that dear and familiar \\"something\\" that was lost and found again - the ultimate and beautiful \\"full circle.\\"  But -  resonating through that final freedom, is the fact that while retirement is envisioned as being able to enjoy all of what was at leisure, is, in stark reality, that of losing people you love; children, old friends.  A film for the ages is this one.<br /><br />A truly remarkable set of DVD's, based on the book by David McCullough, as well as many other fine historical accountings of our Revolution for Independence,  it brings a new dimension to the biography of John Adams. Kudos to Tom Hanks and his associates for bringing this tribute to us.  The breathtaking introduction visual of the segmented snake that \\"joins\\" itself and becomes the entire serpent against the billowing new flag is truly moving if you happen to have even a token of emotion for the act of revolution that has given the rest of us so much to build on.  From there, it proceeds to provide us with something the book can't quite manage - the flesh and blood visuals; the living, breathing complexities dwelling in the personalities of the Revolutionists.  The casting was superb.  From the hard-hearted \\" do or die\\" focus of his cousin Samuel Adams, for whom an end justified the means, to the quiet brilliance of Thomas Jefferson; the controlled discipline behind the intelligence of Abigail; the weakness that threatened all but two of his children and their own spouses as they lived with such a strong father; the imposing, regal figure cut by George Washington; the playful mischievousness of Benjamin Franklin who seemed to consider everyone his personal marionettes.  And Adams' own honest, stubborn integrity that refused to bend or break,  starting with the very unpopular defending of the British Officer and his men accused in the Boston Massacre when feeling was running high against the British.  His worth was evident then; that a free people must have equal protection and adequate defense under the laws and it must be from the beginning in order for it to have meaning.<br /><br />It follows Mr. Adam's family as it endures hardship, selflessness, unimaginable tragedy in the loss of not one but two children, lives through war, politics, small pox outbreaks, and manages to not only survive it all, but be instrumental in the building of a nation from the ground up while it was happening, somehow retaining their emotional sanity.  All travel from the back of a horse or in buggies, or the soggy bottoms of leaking ships, it seems impossible now that they could accomplish so much. Time travel that took months, not hours, letter writing bearing news of vital importance that were always in danger of being lost, intercepted, weeks en route when the messages were needed today.  The scene of Henry Knox spilling his substantial weight all over his saddle as his valiant horse trudged along in the mud behind the \\"appropriated\\" cannons from Ticonderoga - and aptly named \\"Liberty and Independence\\" - was worth it's weight in gold.<br /><br />John Adams had a fascination with Thomas Jefferson throughout his life and even into his death, as they died within hours of each other on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Independence.  Of Jefferson, he loved, revered, valued his opinions, desired his support in all matters political,felt betrayed by him, broke from him; and in the final \\"circle that remains unbroken\\", renewed his friendship with him at the behest of their wise mutual acquainatence Benjamin Rush, who was the last link between them both. A competition with Jefferson even in death, Adam's last words were about the man who had been such an influence in his own life as they both gave up their lives in service to their new country.  He was also clearly dependent upon the bond he shared with his wife Abigail, a man who was mighty when he had the support of those he respected and loved, but less sure of his own abilities when standing alone against public opinion.<br /><br /> Viewing this film should be inspiration for us all.  In truth, viewing any of these new, beautiful documentaries of the Revolution (there are many good ones) and renewing our appreciation of what we have here, would be timely, in this, an election year preliminary.  A good place to start would be Ken Burns \\"Thomas Jefferson\\", which is equally well made.

B004LROMSO|3.0|I confess that I am big fan of Spartacus (also from Starz), so I was eager to give this a try.  Spartacus itself was, well, an acquired taste--it has its own distinctive look and feel which took me a while to get used to...but once I did, I really enjoyed the show.  So, I tried very hard to extend the same patience to my viewing of Camelot.  In the end, it gets a pleasant but uninspired \\"hmmm\\" from me.  It wasn't a bad show, but it had a lot more promise than was actually realized on the screen.   It was nice visually, I'll give it that.  There were some lovely costumes and some of the scenery was simply breathtaking.  But it felt very \\"updated\\" for a film on this subject--hair was very modern or modern inspired, and everything was very very clean--something which was probably not the case in the court of King Arthur.  That is a small nitpick that I could easily look around, especially when the cast is as beautiful as these folks are.  They are definitely a treat for the eyes, and many of the actors did quite a good job given the lines they were fed.  Really, my beef is with the writers, for they failed me with their primary task--creating a fresh and well constructed story.  Everyone knows the classic tale of Arthur.  It has become quite the fashion to retell classic tales, putting a new spin on the narrative, and I'm fine with that.  The plot was close enough on some of the generalized stuff that it was still recognizable as the Arthurian legend--but the Arthur/Merlin relationship was just hard to take (someone else has already commented on his \\"crucial\\" rock-climbing tutorial), Morgan was laughably underdeveloped, and by the end of the season, it felt like the narrative threads were not being handled as smoothly as they should have been.    Insert a Small Guilty Swallow **here**.  I sheepishly report that I still finished the darn thing.  I don't know why.  I don't know why I couldn't stop watching...but I couldn't.  I can't justify it to myself.  I also can't believe it, but I actually want more.  But I can't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quality retelling of Arthur's legend.  I guess it just filled a gap when I needed something moderately entertaining, and for that it fit the bill pretty well.  Here's hoping that the promise of this good cast can be better utilized by some improved writing next season.

159514188X|4.0|Required read for High school, good choice. 16 yr old found it to be a very interesting read. thank you
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I loved the Matrix Trilogy, all three films.  I owned it on DVD and when the price finally became right for the blu ray, I upgraded!  The video and audio quality is incredible.  It doesn't get any better than this.  If you own the dvd version and are thinking of upgrading, do it!  I paid about $25.00 for this set and it was definitely worth it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is simple to learn, but not easy to master. I think that makes this game quite addicting. You think you've got it, then it takes you twice as many moves as it should! I can't think of anything to improve this game - and that says a lot about its quality, because I am a software quality engineer by profession.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|Paul is worth the money because it is very funny. Amazon.com has<br />the right price so buy it now and watch how you'll love too.
1842707310|5.0|I bought this book for my school library.  It is one of the younger kids favorite books and it has a great moral focus lesson in it.  The book was exactly as the seller described. It was shipped in a timely manner and well packaged for safe travel. Thank you!
B003E88TKS|4.0|The last time that I reviewed a film starring George Clooney in this space he portrayed a much put-upon, but ultimately triumphant, fixer-man lawyer in the film, Michael Clayton. I mentioned there that you may \\"buy\\" the fixer-man off, you may knock him around the courts a little with some silly law suit but in no way do you try to kill the bugger when he is doing what he does best, fixing things. Apparently, according the story line here where Clooney plays the hatchet-man for a company that \\"fires\\" high level people for those who do not want to get their hands messy, or place themselves in the line of fire if things go awry, that same poor judgment prevails here.  Oh no, no one is trying to kill Brother Clooney here, well, except maybe kill his spirit through the huge advances in communications technology that allow a company to avoid the expenses associated with flying all over the place in economic bad times to do the \\"canning\\" and thus taking away an old school-style job from Clooney that he has become skilled at. It seems that somebody at headquarters got the bright idea to do the whole process by remote control, through computers. And the avatar of that idea was none other than a freshly- minted MBA (played by Anna Kendrick) out to win her spurs in the tough world of high-tech software innovations. Along the way though, as she tags along with Clooney on his aero-rounds, she gets \\"religion\\" and steps away to find a more socially useful way to flaunt her skills.   But back to George. See, he can see the writing on the wall a little but he is determined to run a rearguard action to defend his reason for existence, his style. Here he is clearly the first, well maybe not first but close, post-modern plastic card man who like Saul Bellows' Dangling Man, or any one of a number of John Updike's modern men, lives a purely existential life, and likes it. With the exception of a baffling relationship with a fellow female business-class traveler (played by fetching Vera Farmiga) who, shockingly (to Clooney) and incongruously (to me), turns out to be just another soccer mom on a lark his life, his solo life, is lived in hotels, airplanes, and rental cars. By the way (BTW for the cyber-slang crazed) George Clooney's cool, clinical demeanor, and his quietly-determined quest for ever more frequent-flyer miles is perfect in this role. But one more time-don't mess with the fixer-man, or the hatchet-man, not if his name is Clooney. Got it.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Crashes when launched on tablet, OS 3.2 Honeycomb.  Works great on my Moto Matrix, OS 2.3.  Also works well on my Epic 4G, OS 2.2.
B0001E7LMU|5.0|Yes, this is the German version of the game (English is currently out of print) but the rules are still available -previous comment has a link to it.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Another review said that Mile 81 is a blend of [[ASIN:0451160444 Christine (Signet)]] and [[ASIN:0451167538 Different Seasons (Signet)]]' Stand by Me and I nearly agree. The cars are indictable, the kids are wise beyond their years. That said, Christine has personality and these kids aren't so much coming of age as growing up too soon.<br /><br />The thing about Stephen King, for me, is that he still delivers the little nuances that made me such a fan of his writing nearly 30 years ago. When the narrative becomes prescient, I love the chill up my spine and the smile on my face. Mile 81 is well worth the $2.99.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Great product with a quick and easy installation. As long as the clips are correctly placed and aligned there should be no worry of breaking them or damaging them. The plastic does feel a bit weak but they are surprisingly very strong little clips.
B004SBX112|5.0|I had this app for a while and I haven't seen a single ad. I don't see why people are complaining. This app works great. Only downside it has is that it takes a while to load up. It might just be my phone.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|finally something useful for daily life! this app is great! i tested the word docs to txt files and they work fine. ill test the excel files next but great stuff! go app of the day!
0307454541|5.0|Not your everyday, cookie-cutter mystery. There's lots of intrigue and twists and turns with the characters themselves. Things unfold slowly and naturally; there is no rushing from one thrill to the next. It's quite a satisfying read, however this and the other two books in the trilogy may prove challenging for those with short-attention spans or those tending to be literal minded.
0062060554|4.0|This book is very interesting and a quick read. It can get a bit repetitive since the main character has to become aware of who she is everyday, but that's the point of the book. The ending is unexpected and makes the book. This book was elected to be read by my book club and I'm looking forward to our discussion on it.
B005MW5CWW|5.0|This album has licks that will have other bands burning with jealousy.  This may be the wrong audience to which to say this but this album is  insanely \\"catchy\\".  I love Leviathan and Blood mountain. If you are expecting Mastodon to get progressively heavier, you may be disappointed, but the music on this album is amazing and the singing stellar as always.
B000VDDWE2|1.0|There are a lot of reasons why this isn't a good movie. It has more than enough tedious cliches. The thematic thread is great, but everything else will leaving you disappointed. It's not so terrible that you will want to turn it off, because as far as overall message it's intriguing. I like to think of it as the best worst movie I've seen.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan, you have to have it. I have watched two of the movies so far. I am not one of those guys that super analyzes the differences so I didn't really notice anything different but it does look nicer in Blu-ray.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. Fantastic lyrics and beat. The cover songs are done beautifully, as well. Definitely a product to purchase.
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|Case worked fine for first few weeks. However , eventual wear and tear of daily use reduces the holding power of the clip, so it worked it's way off my belt several times. The first couple of times I was lucky enough to quickly discover this and recover it (along with the ear bud). But alas, eventually I lost my ear bud when the case fell off for a last time, and I was unable to locate it. Now I'm $100 out of pocket trying to buy another ear bud and case!!
B001OMJGD0|4.0|This Superman is top rated stuff.  Really like the religious overtones, there all over in this movie!  Father and son, people crying for a Savior, it is unheard of in today's movies and it pulled me in.  I think this Superman is the best of the bunch.  The show really pulls you in from the baseball field plane landing, to the kind gentle, humble superman that is portrayed.  Highly recommend!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This product does what it should.  Keeps the monitor completely out of the way and swivels nicely for other views.
1451648537|1.0|Like many others, I pre-ordered this book months's ago on Amazon and I got it last evening. When I opened it, I couldn't believe the page quality of the book! I'm sure, if Jobs was around he wouldn't have allowed this book to published with such poor quality. After all, every apple product was designed/developed by taking care of every minute detail of both IN/OUT of the product.   How could they ignore and print \\"STEVE JOBS\\" on such a poor quality paper! I just hate every one (author/publisher) who is responsible for this. This is too bad.
0451228375|4.0|'world without end' is another great contribution from ken follet.  honestly, i didn't find it quite as good as 'pillars of the earth,' but in its own way it was just as entertaining and fascinating.  there are a lot of the same type of characters and scenerios, but with twists.  for instance, in 'pillars,' we had william, who came from a untrustworthy name, who was a bitter, ruthless enemy to anyone who got in his way.  in WWE, we have ralph - who was just as bitter and ruthless - but still has human tendencies - he loves his family and his brother, merthin, who is one of the story's heroes.  it is interesting to read about how corrupt the priors have become since the days of prior phillip, as well.  and we have two strong women characters again in gwenda and the headstrong caris.  like jack and aliena, merthin and caris are kept apart for years by personal and professional obstacles.  we see the lives of the hardworking peasants in gwenda and wulfric, who are constantly at odds with sir ralph that began with a fight over a woman early in the story. WWE has the same political issues, but with added issues such as homosexuality in the church and putting women in positions of power. the black death becomes the unseeable, unbearably strong real enemy in the story and it really brings home how terrifying it must have been for so many uneducated and helpless of that age. though i felt merthin and caris were jack and aliena all over again - modern day characters who just happened to live in the dark ages - WWE was engaging and absorbing from the first page.  just don't take it on a cruise because the book weighs a ton and your shoulder will ache for days after lugging it around in a tote bag.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is very popular game I've been hearing for a long time till my friends dared me to download it and play it.  Be damned that I got addicted to this game.  I love it so much.  I just turned my husband into this game, too.  Soon, I'll get my son on it, too.  You'll never turn your back if you download this game. You'll probably thank me or curse me, either way.  Buwahahaha.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|There are many versions of A Christmas Carol, and this is one of the best.  A Christmas Carol is one of my all-time favorite movies so I have seen every version.  Everyone should own Disney's A Christmas Carol!!
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Honestly, I hardly use my PS3 these days. In fact, if it wasn't for the re-release of Shadow of the Colossus (and the upcoming The Last Guardian) I might have gotten rid of my PS3 by now. This is a unique game. When discussions about whether or not video games should be considered art this game is usually referenced.   There really isn't much to it, as far as controls and goals are concerned, but the game itself creates an atmosphere that seems tangible at times. The first time you see a colossus rise up when it spots you is a memorable moment.   Even non-gamers may find this a fascinating game to watch someone play.
B00479SVBU|4.0|The FM transmitter is strong. When i use this device in FM mode I can hear no static. The music sounds OK but not as good as the car's FM radio. However, it sounds better when using the aux output(which is the reason why I bought this model). I think it sounds almost as good as a CD player. I'm amazed that this tiny device can play 32G of music. I have just a few complaints. The screen is only wide enough for 16 characters and it does not scroll. So, a lot of the times there's not enough space for all of a song's information. There is no library list. In order to find a song you have to go thru each folder on the 32G card; that's a whole lot of folders. A feature that I find annoying is that it turns on whenever it's energized. So, each time the car is started the device turns on. You then have to manually shut it off, every single time. But, I can't complain too much because it's a good product for the price. I plugged it into the outlet of my portable car booster battery and let it play 8 hours straight on my home stereo without any problems. It didn't even get hot.
0380977273|5.0|Ray Bradbury was the favorite author of my youth. I discovered The Martian Chronicles and Fahrenheit 451 when I was eight or ten and started working my way through everything the library had by Bradbury. This book struck me especially vividly. Perhaps I was just the right age though I never lived in a small town or went to a carnival. The story is so vividly told and so jam packed with wonder and poetry and joy and horror and amazement. Rereading it now some thirty years later, it still thrills and delights. Lasting through time is surely a sign of greatness.  The story is about two boys, Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, who are best friends in a small Illinois town. One day in late October a lightning rod salesman comes, warns them of a coming storm and gives them a rod to protect Jim's house. That night a mysterious train brings Cooger and Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show to town. It seems like a benign carnival come far too late in the season, with Halloween approaching. Evil things are afoot as the boys discover the more sinister side of the side shows.  The book is more than an adventure story. It's more than a coming of age story. It's more than a fantastical horror novel. It deals with old age--Will's dad is also a major character who comes to blows with his advanced years (or so he thinks of the 54 he's had) in the same way the boys confront their looming manhood and soon-to-be-lost freedom of boyhood. The story looks at temptation in many forms and the importance of joy in overcoming evil. It is a rich and full novel that definitely rewards multiple readings. I can't wait to share it with my son when he is old enough.
B005TOW9JM|4.0|Here's the thing....  A.) If you bought Cross, loved it, and are expecting the exact same album (i.e. some really awesome, but super-heavy slammin' electro) then there's a really good chance you're going to be disappointed.  B.) If however you generally like Justice's sound, and can expand that past the strict definition of the first album, then you're going to like this.   C.) If you're a \\"B\\" and you also happen to like classic prog-rock like Yes, Asia, and Rush. Then prepare to totally absolutely love this album more than life itself.   Me, I am somewhere betwixt B+C. So while I would have loved a Cross \\"2.0\\" I still really, really dig this album.   Whereas Cross was an in your face mesh of classic Parisian house and heavy electro, this album is more of an homage to classic progressive rock. Which makes this a little bit more heady on the conceptual level. The \\"problem\\" with that is that you end up with a mix of songs that you can't exactly dance to...from a group that got big on the dance floor. And while I like to dance to Justice, I also just like to listen to them.  So if you really like good interesting music the latest offering from Justice will totally float your boat.   Best tracks to check out are in my opinion Helix, Civilization, On'n'On. For a taste of what I mean by prog-rock homage check out \\"Parade\\".
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was using some always free office app,  only good for basics. This blows the rest away, great functionality for a phone app, very impressive with. xlsx files. And it was the FAOTD! WOW!
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I love it... great music.... great vocals!! It was also very convient to purchase on Amazon and have the produce arrive so quickly. I play it almost everyday right now and I'm enjoying it very much.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The puzzles can be very challenging. Can't ask for much more from a 99 cent game. The only bad thing I can saw about the game is the music gets boring real fast and the coloring is kinda bland. I would definitely recommend the game to anyone.
B00601HFC4|5.0|Well, well, well. So the Bogeyman is real after all. Forget all the things your parents told you when you were a child about the things that go bump in the night. The things that exist, or maybe rather, existed, in this house, do more than just \\"bump\\". Skeletons in the closet? Monsters under your bed? Mice in the attic? You ain't seen nothin' yet! Oh, and just a suggestion? When someone tells you the house that you're about to buy has seen some, shall we say, unforseen events in it; murder, suicide, and ghosts... just to name a few, maybe you should look, elsewhere?   BOO!   Did I scare you? No? Well hang on to your hats, cause this house, next door to The Last House On The left, will. Happy Halloween!  Oh, and leave the light on...
1451648537|3.0|Here are my qualifications for reviewing this biography; I have never owned anything manufactured by Apple and I am a fanatic for PC styled open architecture. But when I saw the I-Pad for the first time I saw the PC transformed into a life changing device that would shape our future. That's when I became aware of Jobs' insight and brilliance. Now that he's dead I really miss him.<br />The book succeeds in capturing Jobs' brilliance. It also succeeds in portraying him as a self-centered jerk of the highest order, not someone you ever want to be friends with, indeed, someone who was incapable of forming close personal relationships. The \\"reality distortion field\\" the book frequently refers to is what killed Jobs. He thought he could treat his cancer on his own, doing it his way, turning down what the doctors promised would be \\"life saving surgery\\" in exchange for his beloved counter cultural \\"alternative treatment\\". When he changed his mind the cancer had grown inoperable and Steve Jobs dies at age 56. Death by fatal folklore.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I am slowly upgrading my VHS collection of all the Halloweens to DVD.  I can't get enough of them and watch them every October in honor of the Halloween holiday.  If you love horror, you'll love this and the rest of the series.  I highly recommend
B003Q6D25K|5.0|DVD arrived slightly later than I expected, but it did arrive in great condition and the dvd itself works perfectly.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I downloaded the Flex T9 Keyboard when it was the free app on here and have grown very attached to it. When OfficeSuite Pro 5 became free for a day I was ecstatic. i opened up to test run the word processor and nothing was appearing when I would Swype a word. If Swype and 3rd Party keyboards and applications were compatible this would definitely be a 5 star application.
B0057R5XRG|1.0|It's sad that the DVDs from several years ago actually look much better than these \\"new\\" blu-ray transfers.  Hopefully Universal will re-release these at some point in the future with better transfers and will exchange them with those of us who have already purchased this set.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I am usually not one for reviews; I will lurk and learn with everyone of them, but I felt that at this time I would speak out.  I have been a devout Yanni fan for a long, long time.  It matters not what CD's or DVD's or MP3's that I own, and I own a lot.  I loaded this onto my MP3 player, and computer, and I use it as a \\"soundtrack\\" for just about everything -- watching my computer load, reading my Kindle, reading an actual book, or just daydreaming.  No, it isn't the Yanni of \\"old\\", in fact, it doesn't really sound like \\"Yanni\\" but an incredible background that I could live with every single day of my life.    Live without this soundtrack?  Not very likely.  Thank you to Yanni!  He will always be one of my favorites!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Enjoying every minute of the dvd's. Hours of enjoyment, good clean family show.  Would recomend to anyone.  Amazon was very prompt.
0470570954|4.0|This is a well-written textbook with superb illustrations.the authors provide numerous real-world examples for every concept. I would definitely choose this text to teach a Biochemistry course.

B005WTR4ZI|3.0|Is the book clear? Yes.  Is the book concise? Yes.  Is the book engaging? Yes.  Is the book onto something? Yes.  Is the book well researched? Yes.   Is the book worth reading? Absolutely!  Why on earth did I rate it three stars then?  Stick with me here. Because the book tantalizes with its subtitle that accelerating change is \\"Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy\\" but just when the book gets going, Chapter Four falls flat and feels like an economic recipe for a by-gone era rather than a roadmap to the economy of \\"the digital frontier\\".  As humanity moved from an agrarian society to the pre-industrial and then industrial era, modern economic models took hold that allowed diverse suppliers to rationalize their efforts in a common way and leverage that effort through a common currency.  In short, barter gave way to the abstract concept of a general currency that could be exchanged for goods.    In that process, the machinery of \\"GDP\\" (consumption) and the corporation became all encompassing.  With comparatively archaic tools (in comparison to the machines of 2011), human beings were the primary way of creating products for those same humans to then consume.  As we began to enter the \\"information age\\" in the 80s, 90s and aughts, we created the early incarnations of \\"the digital frontier\\" in the model of the industrial era (i.e. we remade the factory).  Two examples: Software titans copyrighted their work and big think tanks erected barriers to their information to maintain artificial scarcity that aids in keeping prices up and revenue flowing. This is regardless of the fact that information, once created, can be shared and distributed in an essentially frictionless way. Bits and bytes are not bound by the same physical rules as traditional raw material like wood or rare earth elements.  As we decode the machinery of life (DNA, molecular bonds, nanotechnology, etc), the same will be true for physical things...we'll be able to simply reorder material into a form we want. Early generation 3D printers and tissue regeneration are examples of this trend. Yet we continue to bind these information-era processes to economic models of scarcity.    What we need, and what I was hoping this book would help describe, is a different economic model. An economic model in which the concept of abundance, rather than scarcity, is the central driving force.  We have an abundance of people willing to work.  We have an abundance of information. We have an abundance of things that need to be done.  We have an abudance of ability to connect it all together.  We have an increasingly abundant ability to create stuff for virtually free.  We have 7 Billion people on the planet for whom our moral and social compact drive us to provide them with shelter, food, and health care yet we have an economic model that rewards hoarding and selfishness and creating products that produce huge profit margins when equally good, or better, and cheaper solutions exist.  The successful economic model of \\"the digital frontier\\" will decouple supply and demand.  Profit on the supply side will be driven by those who can create the most social value at the lowest cost (housing for free for example). \\"Pay\\" on the demand side will be driven by rewarding human beings to remain active, productive, engaged, and learning rather than trying to \\"race [the] machine\\".  And, no, I don't mean Communism, I mean a capitalistic system with different measures and rewards.   There are numerous alternatives to a GDP-based economic model that have been put forth.  Examples include \\"Gross national happiness\\", \\"Continuum Development Index\\", and the \\"Sharing economy\\" to name just three.  Search for alternatives to GDP for others.  Yet \\"Race Against the Machine\\" did not explore any of these as possible roadmaps to a world where humans' \\"requirement\\" to \\"work\\" becomes obsolete.  With that said, the book serves as an excellent reference for why these trends are happening and why they areirreversible. Everyone should read this book and then help create an economy of abundance!

B0049P1VHS|5.0|What a great show! A chip off the old block that is an excellent adaptation of Robert Kirkman's graphic novel. The show combines elements of the comic's first and second editions, plus adds new material to keep. We get the camp outside Atlanta PLUS it is set in a rock quarry with a lake. We get Morgan and Dune (Rick's early saviors) PLUS their wife/mom, who was missing from the book.  A few new characters - notably Merle, the redneck crossbowman - bring additional zing to the cast, which is notably more diverse than it was in the book.<br /><br />The TV adaptation often improves on the original, giving us time to get to know the characters before they are inevitably chomped by zombies. It also makes more sense of Shane and Lori's relationship before Rick shows up at camp. In the book, Rick and Lori had a perfect relationship - which didn't square with Lori falling for Shane after just a few weeks. The show fixes that problem, and gives us more of the Shane-Rick-Lori love triangle to enjoy. Andrea and Amy get to bond as sisters. Dale sprinkles the fireside chats with Faulkner.<br /><br />I thought I would be put off by the gore (the book was drawn in black and white) but it is bearable - if very intense. Nothing like watching half-rotted zombie corpses being beaten, blasted, battered and dissected in full color to keep the nervous system a-tingle.<br /><br />The Walking Dead\\" Season One is very watchable, with fun characters and impossible situations. Not at all soap-opery, and great treat. Rauughr!

B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have created a powerful, concise and informative discussion of the impact of technology on employment, income distribution and macro economics.  Do not be fooled by the title, Race Against the Machine is not a neo luddite treatise on the evils of automation and technology.  The title is more about generating buzz and attention than an accurate label for what is in this book -- nothing short of the best explanation of the economy we face in the future and the role of technology.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended to anyone who wants to understand why we can have a recession, a jobless recovery and growing income distribution inequities all at the same time.  This book does a tremendous job steering its explanation based on facts, insights from other economists and thought leaders.<br /><br />Brynjolfsson and McAfee's basic argument is that we are just beginning to see the long term impact of technology on the economy. The authors highlight this using the analogy of Chinese story where the emperor agrees to pay a servant a grain of rice and then doubling that amount for each square on the chess board.  That doubling is the foundation of technology's driving forces embodied in the laws of Moore, Metcalfe and others.<br /><br />The authors believe that we are just getting to the back half of the chess board where a doubling of technology creates gigantic leaps in capability at an unprecedented pace.  These leaps are beginning to displace human work as technologies like IBM's Watson and others demonstrate the ability to handle complex work.<br /><br />The book is divided into five chapters;<br /><br />Chapter 1. Technology's influence on the employment and the economy.  The first chapter provides an overview of the book and its chapters.  Here the authors do a good job supporting their argument based on the observation and ideas of others.  The chapter could have been a dry recitation of prior research, but Brynjolfsson and McAfee have described the issue in ways that are broadly accessible.<br /><br />Chapter 2.  Humanity and technology on the second half of the chess board -- discusses the impact of technology on the economy, productivity and employment.  This chapter focuses on things that are emerging as the capability of technology has crossed a threshold.  The most interesting part of this discussion concentrated on General Purpose Technology (GPT) and how these technologies drive further investment in technology.<br /><br />Chapter 3.  Creative destruction: the economic of accelerating technology and disappearing jobs.  This chapter is the most informative as it explains the impact of technology on employment and income  Here the discussion of highly-skilled vs skilled workers, Superstars vs. Everyone else, and Capital vs. Labor all explain different aspects of the economy we all live in.<br /><br />Chapter 4: What is to be done?  Prescriptions and Recommendations -- contains a list of 13 recommendations for fostering organizational innovation and investing in human capital,  These are two areas where investments can lead to creating new employment opportunities and growth,  I will not go over the recommendations, many are ones that you may have heard of in the past, but the authors put these recommendations into a new context.<br /><br />5. Conclusion: the Digital Frontier -- provides a discussion of the new economy emerging and the impact of digitalization in terms of creating new sources of value and disruption.  It is an apt conclusion to the book.<br /><br />Each chapter focuses on a different aspect technology, the economy, employment etc. in a concise and informative way.

B005J4TLQG|5.0|This movie deserves multiple Academy Awards.  I have yet to see any film that has captured the social climate in the most unique possible way.  The remarks regarding police action in Britain, as well as volunteering for Red Cross in some 3rd World area just \\"to get a good tan\\" were definitely deliberate and proudly blatant. There are 3rd World conditions in Britain as well as the US.  I love the interesting timing of this movie.  The London Riots took place in the Councils.  Just wait until the South Bronx erupts!  This movie sheds light on a very serious topic the masses seem to have overlooked.  Moses, the main character, is played by an \\"unknown\\" actor.  This cat is more authentic that Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson, or any other gangster trying to cross over into acting.  This movie is brilliant.
B005M2A4DE|4.0|While I understand that most people purchasing Series 6 of Doctor Who will just pick up the Part 1 and 2 sets at a cheaper price, I do like having all of the bonus features which are always done very well and having all of the Confidential episodes is great too. What I don't understand however is why they are adding the 2010 Christmas Special with this box set. I already purchased it on Blu-Ray as a stand-alone months ago. That is the only reason I'm giving this 4 stars, for people, like myself, who already own Doctor Who : A Christmas Carol on DVD or Blu-Ray. Also, does that mean that the 2011 Christmas Special will get a stand-alone release and then be added to the Series 7 box set? As for the content itself it's totally 5 stars, there are some fantastic episodes in this set, especially 'The Doctor's Wife' by comic book legend Neil Gaiman. Definitely a must buy for Whovians, I just wish I hadn't spent 18.99 on the Blu-Ray of A Christmas Carol already...

B0053YGYO4|4.0|I really like the fact that coldplay has experimented with their sounds in this album rather than sticking one formula. I have listened to the album about 3 times now and I can already feel it grow on me. I like the fact that album has a theme and a sense of continuity to it rather than a bunch of singles thrown together. This is so hard to find these days. It has some quality songs like \\"Up in flames\\", \\"Hurts like heaven\\", Every teardrop is a waterfall\\", \\"Us against the world\\". However it lacks the one or two block buster hits that all their previous albums have had and Coldplay has a very high bar now. Overall, a nicely done production and miles ahead of the rest of the stuff out there. Pick this up for your collection.

B005OCFHHK|1.0|After seeing what the box set was going to look like for the french version a month or two ago I was really excited! I mean it has a sleek black box and comes with the elder wand! I could not wait to see what kind of box set we were going to get here in the u.s. as well as the u.k. Needless to say I was utterly dissappointed. I feel like so much more could have been done with this box set rather than just put them all together in one set and call it a day.  I will more than likely buy the seventh and final film on blu ray seperately and hope something better comes along for the box set.

B004YJMQCS|5.0|I am a big sucker for horror movies, and this October I think I re-watched my entire collection. I already own other Final Destination DVDs so this one was a welcome addition. The concept supports the other epizodes well. Although it can be qualified as a horror with a big stretch, it's more of a suspense thing. And that's what I like. Quality of image and sound are great. Love it when stuff fly in your face in 3D.
B005D0RDIE|3.0|My love of Rush began with Hemispheres, so I have seen and heard it all.  I just saw the theatrical release of this movie and it's a step up from the quality of their concert films of late.  It's always boggled my mind that a band that has cut such a definitive and noteworthy swath for themselves has really dropped the ball when it comes to their concert films.  In general, the editing seems to follow the lyrics instead of the music.  While there are many parts that cut to the appropriate member for their requisite riff/solo/transition, there were at least 4 times where they cut away from Neil's full riff.  Even when they stayed on the appropriate member for their riff, why do they feel the need to cut to a different (often inferior) angle right in the middle of it?  There's some comfort in the fact that we know Neil's solo will get center stage, but the camera work in general is not superior.  Overall the cutting is too \\"energetic\\", and I'd love to see a cut of a concert film that lingers a bit longer here and there instead of succumbing to MTV editing.  There are many great moments on this disk, though.  I counted numerous goosebumps, and I got particular pleasure from the shot of kids in the audience who really seem to be enjoying themselves.  There's a special magic about the band that comes from almost 40 (!) years of following their hearts, and that energy comes through in their performance.  There are some spectacular moments here, chief among them the jam on Working Man in the encore.  While the guys may have thickened a bit over the years, there's no other band that rocks as hard and as true as these guys.  Also, their newer material comes across particularly well, probably since it's more within their current habits and vocal ranges.  BU2B and Caravan are both blistering.  But old standards sound great, with Freewill and Subdivisions really shining.  Honestly I could have done without parts of Moving Pictures, like The Camera Eye, but since this was a historical inclusion, there it is.  Witch Hunt was surprisingly solid, and the lyrics fit now more than ever).  If you love the band, you'll likely love this movie.  There are also some very entertaining bumpers featuring the band (it makes so much sense that Neil is the cop) and a couple of very funny \\"oom-pa\\" versions of Rush songs.  I'd always give 5 stars to the band, but this video gets 3-1/2.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|First, I went to watch this movie in a theater, also in 3D. I love 3D in general. Although this movie contains one part where it makes me dizzy; in the very beginning the camera pans out to space while rotating, and then goes back down to Earth. As many times as I watched it, it always makes me dizzy. I liked the story, although I have to admit I got it from watching this movie the 2nd time. My favorite part is the fight in the showers with abnormally huge \\"Silent Hill Pyramid Guy\\" ripoff Zombie.  I always wondered, where have they found such a huge actor. It could be CGI though. This movie is full of really cool visual effects. So far it's one of the Best 3D effects of a Blu-ray on our Passive LG Display.  Love Mila and Ali too.
B0000046KM|5.0|I've had this album for years and it is one of my favorites.  The title cut  \\"Here's to Life\\" is stunning.  Johnny Mandel's chart is genius. Who is the French Horn player who does the solo?  Absolutely gorgeous.   \\"A Time for Love\\"...Wynton Marsalis's trumpet solo....a thing of beauty that fits the arrangement perfectly.    Then there's Shirley's vocals all throughout the album...understated....unique...musical..as well as her playing.  This gets a 15 star review....even with 5 stars ...
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Looks very simple and easy to use but there is no way that it should be needing this many permissions.  I downloaded it and it works well but I normally wouldn't trust something that has access to those things with a 10 foot pole.
0385534639|3.0|I feel a little guilty giving this book only three stars, since there were parts of it that I thought were very skillfully done and the circus itself was a wonderful feat of imagination. With that said, most of the characters were very flat (including, unfortunately, the two protagonists), motivations were unclear, and the book dragged badly in places. Also, the author clearly had some important points she was trying to make on \\"magic\\" -- where it comes from and its place in the world -- but she does a poor job of explaining the underlying structure for the mystical element that ties everything in the book together. This makes the magic that's done, lovingly described as it is, ultimately unsatisfying.  The book basically reminded me of some intricate desserts I've eaten in my life -- beautiful, whimsical, but, ultimately, more about presentation than substance.
B00005R87K|2.0|Nosferatu is the quintessential vampire film. Made in 1922 during the German Silent Film era by F.W. Murnau, it has become a shining example of what true horror films are about, and is often considered one of the best horror films ever made. It is definitely essential to the collection of anybody with an enthusiasm for the art of film-making.  However, there are several versions of this classic, each at a different price point. This particular version [[ASIN:B00005R87K Nosferatu]], while claiming to be the \\"original silent vampire classic,\\" is actually slightly, yet vitally, edited. One can notice that all of the intertitles have been reworded, and the characters' names have been restored to more accurately reflect this film's relationship to the book by Bram Stoker. For example, Count Orlock is herein know as Count Dracula, Knock is renamed Renfield, etc. Sadly, the editing of the intertitles, while conveying the same (or similar, at least) message as the original ones, removes a lot of the mood-setting and suspense-creating language that helped to make the original so great.  That said, the price point for this particular version is rather lower than others, and is therefore a little bit more accessible. So, unless you don't mind not having the actual original, go for a different version for sale on Amazon, such as this 2-disc version [[ASIN:B000VUQ4HW Nosferatu (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition)]].
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My two year old daughter loves this movie! The singing and dancing keeps her entertained the way through. This is a very happy and cheery movie. The picture is great.
B004ZNAGNE|5.0|As a long time Pink Floyd fan (yes, vinyls), I was intrigued by the new digitally remastered discs.  In some instances, we've all been disappointed by the \\"new\\" remastering and find it hard to tell the difference from the original. Well, that is CERTAINLY not the case with the Dark Side remaster. Incredible audio and a real fine tuning of the recording to bring out some parts, allowing others to breathe.  A breath of fresh air....thanks Pink Floyd.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|...with Rihanna, thrown in for good measure !  On first listen i wasn't so sure, but give it a number of listens, and a masterpiece shines through ! It's could be classed as an amalgamation of their four previous albums, with some new elements thrown into the mix...who would have thought Coldplay would, or could do dance !! The Rihanna track is excellent and one of the highlights of what is a trully outstanding album !  Each to their own opinion, but i don't understand all the negative reviews...loudness / compression / mix  is it the mix ?...or is there just a lot of instrumentation going on ? )...but what is undeniable, is that Coldplay have produced a wonderful, varied, yet cohesive set of songs, that are excellent from first note, to last !  For me, Coldplay are back to their best, after the release of their weakest and last album, Viva La Vida, and confirms them, as the best band in the world today !

B004W2UBYW|1.0|It is ironic that a biography of the man who released highly polished products only when sure of their content would be an obviously rushed to print mess. I haven't read any of his other works but cannot imagine what it was that drew Jobs to him. Had he read any? I would hope that David McCullough or someone of his stature would undertake the project with the patience required to do justice to the subject. Sure he had his bad points but it obviously wasn't all he brought to the table. I would not recommend this sophomoric POS to anyone truly interested in the life of Jobs.

B000V5Y2DK|5.0|I loved this episode. Yes, it was different, and didn't involve any significant story arcs. But that's OK. It was a diversion, sheer escapist fun. I thought it was a clever concept, and I enjoyed the strangeness and drama of the game (Alamarain!) It was suspenseful. It reminded me a bit of Gamesters of Triskelion from the Original Series. In fact, I think most incarnations of Trek have had an episode like this just for fun. Bashir's screaming like a girl, Odo's violation of Starfleet protocol to save his fellow officers, and especially Quark's groveling to save the lives of his station mates - whom he clearly cares for - were all significant character development pieces. I thought the aliens were kind of stupid-looking in appearance at first, but they grew on me as they played the game. The sets in this episode were visually intriguing, and I liked the camaraderie of the four officers as they banded together to survive - again, it reminded me of Classic Trek. And you've got to love the silliness and embarrassment of the usually poised Sisko and Kira having to play hopscotch! Nicely done!

1451648537|5.0|This is a gripping journey into the life of an amazing individual.  Despite its girth of nearly 600 pages, the book zips along at a torrid pace.  The interviews with Jobs are fascinating and revealing.  We get a real sense for what it must have been like to be Steve, or to work with him.  That earns the book five stars despite its flaws, in that it's definitely a must-read if you have any interest at all in the subject.  But there are places in the book where I have to say, \\"Huh?\\"  The book is written essentially as a series of stories about Steve.  The book continuously held my interest, but some of the dramas of his life seem muted.  For instance, he came close to going bust when both Next and Pixar were flailing.  There was only the slightest hint that anything dramatic happened in those years.  In one paragraph, Pixar is shown as nearly running him out of money.  A few brief paragraphs later, Toy Story gets released and Jobs' finances are saved for good.  We hear a lot about Tony Fadell's role in the development of iPhone.  Tony led the iPod group and was clearly a major source for the book.  You may know from a recent Businessweek article that Tony was basically driven out of the company shortly after the final introduction of iPhone, due to personality conflicts between him and Scott Forestall, the person now in charge of iOS development.  But the book doesn't say a word about it.  Tony simply disappears from the rest of the book with no explanation, and Forestall is barely mentioned.  Another strange incident was the Jackling house, the house he spent a large part of his life in.  A case could be made that the house is historic simply because Steve spent many of his formative years living in it.  Preservationists were battling with him to save the house.  Only a couple of months before his death, when he must have known he was not going to actually build a house to replace it, he had the house torn down.  I would have loved to learn this story.  Why did he buy it?  Why did he destroy it through neglect?  Why did he acquire such a blind loathing for it that he worked hard to get it torn down?   And why did Jobs keep almost all the Pixar options to himself?  He doesn't seem to have needed the money, or even really wanted it that much.  He could have cut his friends John Lasseter et al into their own huge fortunes.  Lasseter only got about $25 million from Pixar, which seems like a shockingly low amount in view of his contributions.  Now, it's not like they will starve or anything, and I think John can buy pretty much anything he wants, but it still seems surprising Jobs is so ungenerous.  There were a lot of things like this, incidents casually tossed away in a brief paragraph that should have merited an entire chapter.  I think this will always be the best account of the emotional aspects of Steve's life, which are fully covered.  The chapters about his illness moved me to tears.  But as an account of what really happened at Apple and how Steve fixed the company, it's insufficient.  I guess that will have to await more distance from the subject.  Of course what's truly remarkable about Jobs is that he lived a life so full of incident that perhaps no biography has the space to cover the broad sweep of his life.  He accomplished as much as 10 ordinarily famous men.  Maybe the upshot is that you just can't fit a man like this in a book, even if that book's nearly 600 pages.

1609611543|5.0|The advice in this book is crucial to understanding why so many of us have chronic problems that don't seem to fit any medical definition. His overview of why wheat has changed is helpful in understanding why past generations didn't seem as afflicted. My family has been wheat-free for a few years, and we have seen the benefits. It's real. I wish the book would have gone into more detail on some of the reactions to gluten, such as itching, anger, brain fog, and other issues, though. I do like that he warns against just replacing crackers with potato chips, an all to easy move. The book is valuable and crucial if you want to have a healthier life. Once everyone avoids wheat, the pharmaceutical industry may collapse, however.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The Tree of Life is a film that can only be enjoyed by those who are in tune with their spiritual side and may not be appreciated by many people. This is the type of film that carries a different meaning for each individual and it has an emotional focus. The story begins with a typical American family in the 1950's living in Waco, Texas. A stay at home mother (Jessica Chastain), a hard working father and their three sons. A family who seems to have it all, until the death of their oldest son changes everything. But not completely for the worst, as it is only after his sons death that his father truly appreciates his son for who he is, as if his awareness has awakened and he now sees the unique and beautiful soul his son possesses. The father (Brad Pitt) is a tough dad who doesn't show much affection to his sons and seems disconnected, except when he is giving them orders.. He seems to have a preference for his second born who resembles him in mannerisms and looks. While his oldest son struggles to relate to his father but just cannot break through, which causes him many feelings of emptiness. The film breaks away from the plot and shows a fascinating look at life through unique cinematography that begins with the formation of the planets and the universe then takes you through the beauty of the ocean, the fury of mother earth through the eruption of a volcano and then ending with the birth of the oldest son who died at the start of the film. The movie then picks up again with the family and continues from there. I understood the movie completely and knew exactly what was going on throughout the whole film. My husband who is not a very spiritually connected person was very disappointed and lost interest quickly. He could not connect the spiritual aspects of this film with what was happening with the family. I feel due to his disinterest I missed a lot of what happened in the film and would like to watch it again alone. Just like the work of an artist, which I find Terrence Malick to be, I believe not everyone that may view a work of art can truly see the beauty or grasp the meaning of what the artist is conveying with each piece which speaks specifically to each individual, as does The Tree of Life.rrence Malick to be, I believe not everyone that may view a work of art can truly see the beauty or grasp the meaning of what the artist is conveying with each piece which speaks specifically to each individual, as does The Tree of Life.

My father died when I was young so I had no experience living in a household with a male and as I was reading I realized how different men and women's thinking are and if I had the basic knowledge of the book previously I would probably have been married to someone else.  Am now divorced (book helped but some things just can't be fixed) for 15 years and am dating again at age 55.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am a student and have tried both quick office and office suite. Three major differences, but in the end office suite is slightly better. First, both programs will have trouble keeping the same format on word if u used a lot of tabs, but there is less format changes with office suite. Second, ppt function on quick office does not allow u to see or edit notes that u put on the bottom, but office suite does. Third, the only thing that quick office is better at, u can make ppt slide changes directly on the slide itself and u can insert pictures easily. unfortunately, office suite makes editing slides somewhat difficult and it is definitely less convenient. However for me, the ability to view ppt notes on the bottom is more important, so I say office suite is the winner. Thanks for making it free amazon!
B004W2UBYW|2.0|I am an Apple fan and own several of their products.  I was really looking forward to this book,  Perhaps my expectations were too high.  The writing is at high school level at best, with poorly constructed sentences and dumb-downed vocabulary.  This is not a serious work, but feels more like a long gossip column.  There are a few interesting insights and some amusing quotes, but a general lack of substance overall.  You might want to spend your money on something more worthwhile.
B001N26GFM|1.0|Sorry, I am a military history fanatic and I watched this movie recently with my daughter.  It is an interesting story, but it's about as historically accurate as Peter Pan or The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.  This movie is decently made, but, the story is complete fantasy and absolutely ludicrous.  This movie is so poor, it's an insult to the intelligence of anyone who's studied German concentration camps at all.  There are far too many historical errors in this movie to list here, but all I can say is this is a work of complete fantasy and fiction - the events portrayed in this film COULD NOT have occurred at ANY German concentration camp at any time.<br /><br />If the point of this movie is to make children identify with the holocaust, which is what it would seem to be, the film makers have done an injustice to everyone concerned.  This goal could have been easily obtained, but instead, they just made up an absolutely ridiculous story with an equally ridiculous ending.<br /><br />Sorry to all of those who loved this film, but I didn't find it moving or touching, I couldn't get past the absurdity of the entire film to connect with the \\"moving\\" story it was supposed to be conveying.  There are FAR better films out there dealing with the Holocaust, DO NOT waste time watching this one.

030788743X|5.0|I read a review of this book in Time magazine and could not wait to start. . .an adventure filled with cultural references to the '80s? Ready Player One didn't disappoint. It's an action filled page-turner that is clever, funny and nostalgic. Characters are a bit cartoonish and two-dimensional at times, but I didn't care; this is just solid fun from beginning to end, especially for those of us who grew up in that era. I read this book in three days; really an enjoyable read.

B005M2A4D4|1.0|It seems crazy but this series was originally shown on British television in two parts (thus Amazon is also selling this series as Part I and Part II).  Also Part I and Part II of this series were shown several months apart which gave the producers the time to make significant changes from the entire series being one story arc, as it is Part I, but because of fan complaints, in Part II the producers switched to single story episodes which improved Part II of this series remarkably.    Part I of this series is convoluted, boring and at times overly juvenile and a complete waste of money so do not buy this complete set, rather you are better off buying Part II of this series because the changes there were made to perfection.  It's hard to believe that Part I and Part II were created by the same people.   I know for some who haven't seen it, yet despite a bad review, it is hard to resist buying Part I so to please your curiosity perhaps renting and viewing a few episodes in Part I will prove my point.    In my humble opinion purchase Part II instead.  Besides, the answer to the what the crack in the wall is was only answered during the finale in Part II and most people had forgotten all about it by that time which demonstrates just how bad Part I really is.
0486236951|5.0|Great book! I love the traditional white work and so this is a great book. It has some nice techniques and designs to use. It also has some good working tips.
081297381X|2.0|The book has many good bits--thinkers, quotes, intellectual cautions, etc.--and a breezy style.  It is also deeply flawed by manipulative terminology and argument, a heavy dependence on the narrative form that it dismisses as deceptive, endless name dropping, ad hominem argument, a conspiracy theory of intellectual history, and what I believe is a dated understanding of neurocognition (specifically, his dismissal of the usefulness of system 1 thought and the essential role of emotion in thinking). (See Parasuraman. Neuroergonomics.)  Consider Norretranders, The User Illusion for a more paradigm-shifting, better supported, and more cogent approach to what the good bits here might add up to. (Or Parasuraman, for a more carefully researched approach to some of the same issues.)
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Ordinary people put on their edge, bordering on hysterically funny madness, because of extraordinary circumstances. It's a beautiful combination of the Sopranos, Tarantino, and Twin Peaks - freaky, funny, ironic, synchronistic-inter-related plot, violent, qwerky, showing the very human dark side of fear, greed, addiction, control, and ultimatums of human existence - life and death, interwoven with Love, family, Loyalty and Friendship. Extraordinary acting and directing brilliance that brings back the art of the cliff-hanger. I love this show because each episode resets \\"The new normal\\" for characters and story - \\"how can this get any worse? No! Don't go there! Damn you went there??\\" A truly amazing series that is addicting to watch. Viewer beware! LOL

1433261170|2.0|i listen to audio books all the time. once a month i drive from san francisco to LA. and audio book is a great way to pass the time. i didn't know much about this book, until i saw a trailer for a movie of it coming out in a few months. since, the movie looks great, and something i would like, i thought it would be nice to listen to on my next trip to so cal. about 3 chapters in i had to turn it off. i didn't care for this audio version of the book at all. maybe it was the narrators tone though out or the fact that i had no idea what was going on, what time we were in, or who we were talking about. i am sure people love this book and hold it in really high regards, but i didn't care for it, and i found it to be quit boring.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I commented on a similar review, but I just read the full list of permissions. This app asks for permissions that will allow it to:  Open connection ports that may have otherwise been blocked for general security reasons (think \\"firewall\\" concept)  Be alerted whenever your system boots up  read text messages  and most blatantly disturbing, access to your accounts. IE your gmail and whatever other email accounts you have saved on your phone.  None of these things are remotely relevant even for the purpose of legally gathering your information to sell to advertisers (which ethically, a pay-for app shouldn't do anyways by industry standards). They *are* however the precise system permissions that you'd want for hacking an OS, gathering private data, and more.  For the record, I'm not one of the tin-foil hat people here; I've been trying to start up as an independent dev on the android market and have several good friends already in the software industry who love talking about how easy it is to do something malicious that appears totally inconsequential at first glance.
B004HNTER6|5.0|\\"Senna\\" is a documentary film which honorably acknowledges the outstanding F1 racing career of Ayrton Senna, and his admirable compassionate nature.

1423140591|5.0|This is a fantastic installment in the Heroes of Olympus series. Well written and fast paced. Can't wait for the third book.
0374531269|3.0|When I started reading this book about six pages in I was ready to close the book. I kept reading though to see if anything interesting or crazy was going to happen. While reading i kept checking to see how many pages were left in the chapter, thinking to myself if nothing interesting or crazy happens by the end of it i would put the book down. The author started off talking about his childhood too much and nothing really interesting was going on since he was so young. As I came closer to the end of the chapter though things got a little more interesting when a car pulled up in front of the author's grandma's hose filled with dead bodies. From this point on I couldn't stop reading.  I learned how to be more grateful for the things I have from reading this book. This book made me think about how good my life is compared to other people and made me appreciate life more. I would recommend this book to people 14 and up because of how graphic the book was. Anyone who hates their life and doesn't appreciate the things they have should read this book to see how good they actually have it.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|This is the best I have ever seen this movie, and probably the best anyone has seen this movie since it was created. You can just see the love and care the disney animators made this movie with 70 years ago, and the same love and care was used to restore this film. As a kid who grew up with this movie, seeing it again in this format is a real treat. A must buy for any fan of this film.

B004HW7JMO|4.0|I had watched both seasons 1 and 2 on Starz back home and felt the need to get back up to speed out here at school before the next one comes out in a few months. I can be a pretty masculine guy at times, so obviously a show like this has held my interest from the get-go, but surprisingly this story appealed to my artistic and creative side as well. True, the series is over-the-top violent, and portrays a very raw and graphic period of human history, but there's some beauty in it all; not only are some elements of the story fact-based, but the visuals are presented in an artistic and expressive way, instead of just some perverted collection of beheadings and sex scenes. Many times, I find myself emotionally bonded to both Spartacus in S1 and Gannicus in S2, celebrating their triumphs and lamenting their torment. All in all, both seasons of Spartacus change the game in terms of a television series, and if you can watch a few episodes and go without flexing in the mirror for the rest of the week, then you're of a stronger mind than most (myself included). Bring on Season 3!

B0009P5YXO|4.0|Works just perfectly, and its super awesome that they include the batteries. It comes in that plastic casing that is a bitch to open. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to open the casing to get to the battery compartment. And make sure you insert them the right way first (+/-) because it's very tricky to get them out.  Other than that, I love it! The light, the sound, and it extends. I only wish you could change the pitch, but at this price, it's still a great purchase.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|First, let me say that I was not the biggest Green Lantern fan growing up. I rented this because I was curious about some of the positive reviews here and elsewhere. OK, I rented the disk from a local Blockbuster, took it home, popped a bag of corn, got a beer out the fridge and settled in expecting, if not a great or even a good movie, a movie that could hold my attention for an hour or so.<br /><br />Not. First, no need to give a synopsis as this page pretty well sums it up. What turned me off to this story, this film, is that it looked too much like a cartoon. The cg in this film looked cheap and cheesy a la Phantom Menace Mars Attacks cheesy. And the story was simply too familiar to involve myself in. The dialogue was flat. The heroic moments in the film where I am supposed to cheer and pump my fists left me cringing in embarrassment. This film just didn't have anything absolutely zero going for it at all. There's one scene where a helicopter is sliding through a group of people at this party. You'd think someone would have been killed by the spinning propeller blades but miraculously no one does and at the last minute our  hero Green lantern and his magic ring saves the day by catching the plane in a green hotrod and diverting it out of harms way. Then, as a spectator is catching him on her camera phone, our hero, a la Superman 1, flies away.<br /><br />I've been watching this movie a chapter a day for the past 2 weeks because I can't sit through the whole thing. This film is that bad. And just because I couldn't base this review on the entire film should tell you all you need to know about it. It's not even bad enough to be funny. My advice? Rent it for a buck.
0451232577|5.0|I had a personal interest in this tale, because my Father had to leave his studies at the University of Heidelberg in Germany on the orders of my Grandfather in Lithuania. He knew the Bolschevik Revolution was about to begin, and my Father would have been conscripted into the Russian Army. My Father was sent to the US, and though he spoke 8 languages fluently, English was not one of them.  This book took me on a journey that felt as though I was personally involved. I heard many stories from my family about what happened in Russia, and how it affected the Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia). The research Ken Follett did was exemplary. Again, we are subtly introduced to the nuances of political intrigue...the lies and deception with the people being the victims. Not much has changed since 1914, almost 100 years ago. Perhaps by 2014 things will be different. When is book two going to be available?  Mariah Adams
B000059Z8J|5.0|There have been remakes that have stood up to their original sources. Scarface is one that comes to Mind. The 10 Commandments. Lolita to name a few. Then there are some films that are so legendary, so iconic, that to even suggest remaking them verges on sacrilege.The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Scarface, Citizen Kane, etc. I'd put the original Superman in this group. I think there are roles that certain actors were born to play, that they completely and positively own, that are them and, to this moviephile, Christopher Reeves didn't play Superman, he WAS and still IS Superman and any 3D cgi reincarnation of the role is doomed to invite comparisons to Reeves and will fall miserably short.<br /><br />For anyone whose been in a coma the past 30 or so years, the film lays out the origin of the son of Krypton, his escape from his own dying planet to Earth where he's raised by his adoptive parents as Clark Kent, his awakening to his powers and his destiny, and his role conflict expressed through his infatuation of a female colleague at the Daily Planet, Lois Lane, and his greater responsibility to protect the human race. Reeves perfectly embodies the contradiction of his two personas. As Clark Kent, reporter at the Daily Planet, he's modest, unassuming, weak (he needs glasses to see properly), and he, like everyone else, envies his alter ego who's the complete opposite. But even so, when you see Clark, the wholesome farmboy who sends half his check to his elderly mother, you see Superman and vise versa. Clark embodies what all of us, who've been blessed with superior abilities should be like: humble, generous, deflecting praise, using our powers to help others--Reeves embodied this principle and wasn't just another pretty boy with muscles. I don't think anyone else has or can pull off the Man of Steel with the same charisma and charm and life Reeves channeled into this character. When the Dark Knight dropped, I jumped the gun like everyone else and said that it was the best superhero movie ever made. But then I remembered this wonderful magical film and its star Reeves, Margot Kidder (hang in there, babe), Gene Hackman, John William's rousing score, and I quickly revised my ranking of the Dark Knight: it is the 3rd best superhero film ever made. This film, Superman, and its sequel, are the best Superhero films ever made thanks to a man who was even more of a Superman in real life. Rip, Chris.o movie ever made.

B0040UAYI4|4.0|Well I have to say I was skeptical at first buying this device. However I have to conclude that this has allowed me to pick up PS3 first person shooter titles. I will be the first to admit that I can not shoot my way outta a wet paper bag with a controller. However this evens the playing field. I use a mx500 and mx510 mouse with the device I have found that they work very well with the EE.<br />I can say however to expect this to react like a controller does. It is not precise as a game that would Nativity support a keyboard and mouse. However with the proper configuration to sensitivity etc. It will help greatly.<br /><br />However I gave it 4 out of 5 on overall just due to the fact that it feels so light and plasticy. The problem is just at full extension of cord it tends to get pulled from desk too the floor.

Booooooooo. 9 Dragons was such a disappointment, that I really felt Connelly redeemed himself with this book, until I got to the last ten minutes.   Of course, I will be the first to pick up his next book! His worst is better than most writers' very best.
B005G4TJI4|3.0|This is not a movie review.  If you are reading this by now you have already decided whether or not you like this movie.  I am here to write about the product.  In short, I liked the movie but, I didn't like this product.  All that it provides is the move in three different formats; Blu-ray, DVD and download.  The weakness is that that's it.  No extras, no deleted scenes, making-ofs, or interviews just the movie.  The movie looks good in 1080p which does it good service but, at the end I felt a little jipped when I find out that's all I got.  At $20 you get what you paid for but, if you are waiting for the full home viewing experience I'd hold off on this buy and wait for the full set.

1241681244|4.0|I ended up reading Bonfire after reading \\"Man in Full\\" and \\"I am Charlotte Simmons.\\"  All three have a similar style and feel about them.  I thoroughly enjoyed all three, including Bonfire.  The difference in Bonfire is that at first I didn't care for any of the characters.  In fact, all the main characters leave a bad taste in your mouth.  Later, as the plot unfolds, some of those feelings change.  It is a tribute to the author's excellent writing and grasp of human nature that even though I disliked the characters, I was drawn to them and their story.  Its like a New York version of a Greek tragedy except it unfolds over the course of a majority of the book.  The characters seem real--the story seems real and you end up rooting for the protagonist despite his many flaws. This is the Great American Novel--the kind that is rarely written these days.  Bonfire is a book that will continue to be read 100 years from now--a modern classic.  Highly recommended.
0446571415|2.0|I have been a big fan of David Baldacci since his very first book.  But I have a hard time believing that the same author who wrote Absolute Power also wrote Hell's Corner.  Hell's Corner, the latest book in Baldacci's Camel Club series, is just too over the top.  It defied belief from start to finish.<br /><br />Former CIA assassin Oliver Stone is called to the White House by President Brennan.  It seems that the Russians have taken over the Mexican drug cartel.  Brennan wants Stone to travel down to Mexico to scope things out (first big stretch).  Walking through Lafayette Park late at night before his departure, Stone finds himself in the middle of a terroristic act which is apparently directed toward the prime minister of Britain (stretch two).  So now Stone is transferred to this new case and is assigned MI6 agent Mary Chapman to assist him (stretch three).  The FBI and the NIC are all on board with Stone's involvement (stretch 4).  And when the bad guys seem to know every step they're taking, Stone recruits his friends in the Camel Club to help him (stretch five).  Each situation becomes more unbelievable than the last--with the ending being the most incredulous.<br /><br />I did enjoy small tidbits of history and trivia.  Lafayette Park used to be part of the White House grounds until Thomas Jefferson plowed through Pennsylvania Avenue.  Also, Stone calls Lafayette Park Hell's Corner because \\"'Pennsylvania Avenue, the actual street, belongs to the D.C. metro cops.  The sidewalks around Lafayette Park are the Secret Service's turf and the park itself comes under the jurisdiction of the Park Service.  Secret Service agents are actually taught to grab a person of interest from the street or park, carry him to the sidewalk and then arrest him there to prevent a pissing contest over jurisdiction.\\"  No matter what is happening in Washington, this jurisdiction-issue applies to almost every agency (FBI, CIA, NIC, Secret Service, etc.).<br /><br />I keep telling myself that I'm going to stop buying books from Baldacci's Camel Club series.  But I keep hoping that in each new book, Baldacci might revert back to the brilliant writer who penned Absolute Power and The Winner.ing books from Baldacci's Camel Club series.

0385344325|2.0|I waited a very long time for the newest Reacher book.  I am as disappointed with this newest Reacher novel as I was with John Sandford's newest Davenport novel.    I am a fan of shoot-em up, mystery crime books.  I know Reacher has women in his life because I've read every single Reacher novel.  I don't understand why Lee Child felt the need to include details of sexual encounter.  When I want the descriptives of \\"and then he licked her neck and she smelled like midnight,\\" I'll reach for a Nora Roberts novel.  It felt like pandering to a female audience, which he doesn't have to do.  We girls love Reacher just the way he is.  Oh, and if anyone is listening ... I heard that they're thinking of Tom Cruise as Reacher in \\"One Shot.\\"  Please, I'm begging you, don't do it!!  How about Hugh Jackman? :)
B005W8SNNG|1.0|Not worth the purchase, rental or even 1 star. There is absolutely nothing funny about the film.  Please do not watch this movie with any child under the age of 16.  Just my opinion!

0399536108|5.0|I've been a fan of Chris Guillebeau for quite some time, and was lucky enough to meet him when he swung by Los Angeles during his book tour last year. Chris is not simply a non-conformist... he's a a non-conformist who makes things happen. And he's committed to helping other would-be non-conformists also make things happen. His book is essentially a distilled version of his blog, but it's still a great book, and is packed with valuable information and insights. It's part manifesto, part business book, and part kick-in-the-butt-wake-up-call, with the primary aim of inspiring you to live the life you want. And the fact that Chris is so candid about his own struggles and mistakes make his insights even more valuable. So if you're serious (or just curious) about going against the grain and joining the ranks of creative non-conformists (a slight contradiction, but oh well), you definitely need to read this book!

B004EPZ09S|5.0|At the recommendation of another family member, my husband and I went and saw this film yesterday.  Both of us loved it and thought it was extremely well done.  The spread of the contagion, the looting and public panic, the blackmail, the dishonesty, paranoia, and so forth were very realistically portrayed.  Despite what some other reviewers have claimed (ie, this \\"...could NEVER happen!!\\"), I can totally see something like this happening.  With people who refuse to vaccinate their children leading to a resurgence of once-eradicated diseases and with significant percentages of the population failing to wash their hands on a regular basis, diseases can spread very rapidly--just as is portrayed in the movie.  It's a scenario I hope I never see first-hand, but it was very engrossing and entertaining.  All of the performances are excellent and very believable.  The music by Cliff Martinez also deserves special mention, as both my husband and I really enjoyed it.  In fact, I may have to purchase the soundtrack.  I am also very tempted to buy this movie when it comes out on DVD.  Really a good show and one I very highly recommend, although be aware that you may find yourself a tad paranoid for a while after seeing it.  :)
B004HO6I4W|4.0|Premise:  A rare blue Macaw is captured from the Brazilian rain forest and smuggled to Minnesota where he's expected to sell, but like any good cartoon, he falls off the truck and adopted by a sweet girl who raises him. Unfortunately since he's grown up in captivity, he doesn't know how to fly. Things get interesting when some ten or fifteen years later an ornithologist receives word of his location and convinces the girl who owns him to fly down to Brazil where he can mate with potentially the last female blue Macaw and repopulate the dying species.  Standouts:  I know I'm going to sound cliche, but animated musical numbers were much better in the 90's. Thankfully they kept this to a minimum, but the film still paled in comparison to just about any of Pixar's stuff. Blue Sky Studios produced this animated feature, and it's very evident when watching it. There's just something about the use of physical comedy and odd-use of sexuality that didn't feel like a Dreamworks or Pixar feature.  My Highlights:  Any scene with Tracy Morgan's character, anytime the male blue Macaw tries to put his moves on the female, the toucans, and the monkey tourist trap.  Overall Rating:  I thought everyone did a great job in this film, though at times I thought Jesse Eisenberg could have been a little more impactful in his delivery. Apparently he was voice-acting for this film whenever he wasn't live-action acting for The Social Network, so it's not surprising he might have been a little burned out or tired when doing this. The animation was another really huge upside to this film, because everything looked beautiful and could do a lot of good business for Brazil. Plot, inventiveness, and suitability-wise, I was a little disappointed in Rio. It felt like it was just missing it's potential by a little bit in so many scenes. I give this film a respectable 3 1/2 *'s out of 5, or 7 *'s out of 10.  When You Should See It:  If you / your kids really liked Ice Age or Horton Hears A Who, check it out. If you're not the type to go out and rent animated films unless they're getting amazing hype, you can skip this one with a clear conscience.
0385341008|3.0|3.5 stars. I really loved this book at the beginning but, unfortunately, it grew increasingly precious. People were uncharacteristically obtuse for the sake of humour and plot advancement, which was a bit disappointing. Overall, though, it's a charming read and an interesting peek into history (albeit fictional).
B0050PYNO4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, felt it was a great use of my time, and was almost inspired in terms of writing characters and character connections. Though I wasn't busting a gut laughing at too many scenes, there were enough comedic scenes, enough mind-opening scenes, and enough emotional scenes for a rating of 4 1/4 *'s out of 5, or 8 1/2 *'s out of 10. The only reason this rating wasn't higher was for the few flat scenes.  For a more detailed review, visit OrganizedRemains.blogspot.com or OrganizedRemains.com

But Transformers, that advertise a kids theme, sold as toys at stores, can be find in MacDonald happy meals. So you would think the movie be for kids. But it not. They focus more on Sam and love gal then what the robots story. Forget Sam, the name of the movie is TRANSFORMERS.   I rate this movie 1star...love the CGI for the robots. But you barley seen the robots. The whole movies is about Sam and his love interest.  Michael Bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about TRANSFORMERS...pitiful

I highly recommend it to anyone who just wants to laugh without thinking too much about it. After this I read her Confessions of a Shopaholic, which didn't have the same affect on me.
B005HS00ZU|5.0|Wow.<br /><br />I mean, WOW.<br /><br />Just got done watching this on a Sony XBR-HX929 46\\" 3D TV -- 2 hours of pure Peter Gabriel goodness... in 3D. I would have a hard time believing that being AT the concert would be better than seeing it like this, with all of the different 3D camera angles and the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound. The selection of songs includes everything from Peter's \\"New Blood\\" CD, and then some. The picture is amazingly sharp and the 3D cinematography is top-notch -- so much so that if I want to demo 3D to someone, I'll use this instead of \\"TRON Legacy\\" from now on. Peter is a consummate showman and it's clear that he puts a lot of effort into making his concerts unforgettable experiences.<br /><br />Other musicians need to watch this video and try to keep up. THIS is how you do a music concert on disc.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|In the light of current events (at this writing, the Occupy Wall Street movement) this movie seems more than prescient. Moore deconstructs the American love affair with what we revere as \\"capitalism,\\" and points out exactly how it comes up short. In spite of what we are told, we will not all become millionaires, and the wealthy do not want us in their treehouse. Moore tells us this, not without compassion. There are some elements of haranguery going on, yes, and Moore remains a somewhat annoying presence at times, but overall this movie is too important to quibble about things like that. If you watched it before, watch it again. If you haven't seen it, now's the time.

B004P1JDJO|4.0|This is book about what motivates people.  In a nutshell (spoiler alert), it says that \\"carrot and stick\\" techniques are not effective motivators.  The author argues that \\"carrot and stick\\" was designed for the industrial age with the presumption that people are slackards.  He summons a variety of research from the last 30-40 years and concludes that, once basic needs are met, 85% of people are most effectively motivated by jobs or activities that offer autonomy, potential for mastery and a sense of purpose.<br /><br />While that pretty much sums it up, the book is still worthwhile.  It is easy and entertaining reading that puts some meat on the bones of my summary.  It is not, however, new or groundbreaking research.  It is reminiscent of Malcomb Gladwell's \\"Outliers\\" or David Brooks' \\"Social Animal,\\" both of which I enjoyed. I can't say I found a lot of new information here, but it did stack some of the old information into a neater and fresher pile.
B005ERWUKC|5.0|From start to finish, I find this album to be a journey. As a die-hard M83 fan, I find it fantastic to hear Ant experiment with new sounds and really putting his voice out there. It may not be as ambient as I wanted, but it's not like I put in the effort to making the double LP. It's not really what I was expecting, but I don't mean that as a negative thing at all. I enjoyed being caught off guard. It's very nice to see an artist try something different and not deliver the same sound as before just because it was successful.  Hurry Up, We're Dreaming takes everything I love about M83 and expands it. The album has a feel-good essence and really makes me want to jump up and groove with somebody. It may be personal to me, but I'd love to be able to thank Anthony for the bursts of happiness this album has delivered. The plethora of sounds melt my brain as the flow through my head.  Compared to other modern Pop(ular) albums, I think HUWD definitely tops them all with innovation. But again, maybe I'm just biased.
0525423281|5.0|Oh Lola, you make my heart so sing! Stephanie Perkins has done it again. She won us over with Anna and the French Kiss last year and she did it again with Lola in 2011. Well be warned that Lola and the Boy Next Door might have surpassed Anna. When I heard that Lola made a small brief appearance at BEA, I knew she would be gone before I could lay my hands on a copy. Thanks to Andye at ReadingTeen, she let me borrow her copy on the way home from BEA. Reading Lola on a plane for 3 hours was possibly the best plane ride ever.<br /><br />When Stephanie Perkins writes, she write with so much love, passion, warmth, affection, attachment, enjoyment and yearning. I think you get my point. It beyond a breath of fresh-air. Her books are the perfect ones to pick up when you need to feel overjoyed, they will change whatever mood your in and covert it to pure joy. The great thing is that its not sappy or repugnant. Lola also gives us so many great and funny one-liners from the characters. I would laugh out loud where ever I was reading the book.<br /><br />The characters are so complete that you mesh well with them. Stephanie writes them very realistic. It's the story that can happen to you or anyone you know. You have a girl that has 2 dads or a family that their lives revolves around the life of their Olympic skater daughter. See what I mean about real, this could be any one of you. Then of course you have the setting. Even though Lola is not taking part in Paris like Anna did. San Francisco when written by Stephanie because one of the travel spots you must visit on your bucket list too.<br /><br />So I begin the tale of Lola, she is a spunky girl that happens to have to two great Dads. She dresses according to her mood and that includes matching hair pieces. She has a rocker musician boyfriend, who tends to smell like smoke but she deals with it. Now Lola does have some relationship issues and they worsen when a certain family moves back in next door. The Bell family that would be. Their daughter is trying to make the Olympic team for Ice Skating and have come back so she can train and prepare herself. Cue in Cricket, yes I said Cricket. Cricket Bell is the boy next door. How close you might wonder, well Cricket and Lola's windows are facing each other and within reach by a pole. This is Lola worst nightmare to have Cricket back in town. Will Lola be able to over come the past and at least become friends with the boy next door?<br /><br />Yes I know, I left you hanging but why would you want me to spoil the story. A few more great things about Lola. We know that its a companion to Anna. I didn't know what this meant until I saw it mentioned for Lola. The story basically does not continue from the last books. You will get a new and never told before story but you do get guest appearances from characters from the first novel. So basically you get Anna and St. Clair in Lola and the Boy Next Door. This just adds the icing to the cake. You don't follow their story but they are somehow involved with the new characters.<br /><br />Now with Lola and the Boy Next Door and Anna and the French Kiss sitting on my top contemporary novels of all times list, I can't wait to see what Isla and the Happily Ever After will bring in 2012. Who do you think will make appearances in Isla?ing to make the Olympic team for Ice Skating and have come back so she can train and prepare herself. Cue in Cricket, yes I said Cricket.

B005Y841QC|4.0|*Possible Spoiler Alert!*  An episode that is aired directly after the last two episodes to be like this one doesn't make a lot of sense to me right now. Sam and Dean never give up on anything, they've brought each other back from the dead, they stopped the apocalypse, and Dean kills Sam's friend from the past because of what she is and what she has done. They meet two witches that have killed numerous people, but for some reason they will let them go? Just like that? I understand where the idea comes from, but it doesn't seem much in Dean's character to just, let it go like they did.

0061452068|5.0|RECOMMENDED VIEWING: RIDLEY SPEAKS AT TED TALKS ABOUT THIS BOOK<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I would consider this book a must-read this year, if you're interested in interesting historical \\"sound-bites\\" which directly relate to our time.<br /><br />It's a change of pace in which Ridley challenges the status quo by stating that our species is actually improving -- that our future is quite hopeful -- as opposed to the overwhelming amount of alarmist information in fields like climate change, population growth and violence.<br /><br />The only real obstacle here is the questionable validity of the sources of all his hundreds of statistics. At face value, it makes a great case.

B005D0RDKW|5.0|Just came from seeing this on the national theater release night. In my case it was at the Arlington MA \\"Regent Theater\\" - a theater that has shown Rush rocumentaries in the recent past (and hosted the excellent Rush tribute band \\"Lotus Land\\" who opened last year for the \\"Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage\\" screening).  For tonight's screening of \\"Time Machine 2011: Cleveland\\" the biggest Rush-celebrity not in the band Donna Halper was there and took stage before the show to share stories of having been at the Cleveland concert as a VIP and of her continuing years being a friend of the band & vice verse (she's from Dorchester MA originally and seems to reside here in Boston again). Donna was well received and she noted Rush fans are loyal and friendly like no others. Donna also made special point of sharing the guys in the band are not only exceptional musicians but are the most genuine nice guys she's known and that's over a long 40+ year career in media/broadcasting having meet all sorts or rock-stars that have come & gone. Of course she was preaching to the choir tonight but hearing from multiple sources that they're great guys off stage somehow makes it that much more enjoyable seeing them do their thing so well on-stage.  Was an excellent and long show (the concert & some Rush theatrical extras I won't spoil) with us having an enthusiastic theater crowd to take it in.   Notably it's the band's first live concert filmed in the United States and along with other very new and old tracks they performed Moving Pictures album live in its entirety (but possibly not in origial order).  I intend to preorder the Blu-ray edition to add to my Rush vid collection.  Conform or be cast out!

B0053YGYO4|4.0|Given the success of Viva La Vida and how well that album was crafted from the first song to the last, it would be hard for Coldplay to duplicate it exactly without being derivative in some fashion.  I still have mixed feelings on the direction that MyloXyloto takes them.  There is something about it that puts me off a bit.  I have listened to the CD about 10 times now, and I like it better each time.  However, I can't get passed the feeling that this CD flows less easily than Viva La Vida does.  It seems to lack cohesion.  There are a few start-stops with up tempo songs followed by slower less frenetic songs, but it seems less well handled here.  Viva La Vida seemed to flow from start to finish, if as one musical piece.  The other problem that I am beginning to notice less with each listening is how different the mix is, or seems to be.  There are so many layers and textures that the vocal track seems swamped at times.  Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations.  This is not Viva La Vida II, by any stretch.  But, it is not much more than what we already knew from the singles and songs like Charlie Brown that were on Youtube.  The best songs:  Charlie Brown, Every Teardrop, Paradise, Hurts Like Heaven, and Major Minus.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|This is the ultimate Dark Side Of The Moon experience.If you are a fan of this album or Pink Floyd by any stretch of the imagination then this wonderful box set is for you.First the album remastered by James Guthrie and he did a great job with it.The second cd is Pink Floyd doing the album live in Wembley in 1974 and the sound is incredible.I just wish that they would have released this earlier.Just makes you think about what they have in their vault just sitting there waiting to be heard by the fans like me.Disc 3 is dvd audio and there are 5 different mixes of the album.Now disc 4 and 5 are basically the same except disc 5 is the blu-ray format so if you don't have a blu-ray player you aren't missing anything because they have you covered and they have already put a dvd version in there for you.Now disc 6 has something really special there is a early mix of the album by Alan Parsons who was the engineer on the album before he went on to be a performer in his own right and the mix is really great.Not on that there is some demo's from the album like the demo for Us and Them from Richard Wright and Roger Water's demo for Money.There are some early version's of The Travel Sequence which was later renamed On The Run,one is a live version from Brighton and one is a studio take on it.The rest of the items in the boxset are just gravy on what is already a full plate.Pink Floyd really gives you your money's worth with this one.If you love this album like me get it you won't regret it at all.

B005IZLPKQ|3.0|I reserved the movie on Redbox, made some popcorn, and watched the movie on my decent 50\\" HD TV.  I really liked the special effects and it was easy to watch all the way though. The costumes were great and aesthetically pleasing. The only scenes that seemed insincere was after Bucky fell to his death, the dry eyes were unconvincing.  The scene with the snow & zip line was very deja vu, I'm pretty sure they used the same scene twice.  The typical conventional hollywood narrative of the protagonist's struggle between good and evil was brief and poorly developed...  But most of all, the entire movie felt like an advertisement to join the army.  From the time the protagonist tells how both his mother and father died while serving, to the time Red Head tempts him offering \\"You could have the power of the Gods...No countries, One world!\\" He's like \\"Neer, I love America!\\" Then in the end he makes a date which he would like to but doesn't intend to keep, giving the impression, \\"A good soldier puts his country before romance.\\"    The whole cryogenicly frozen bit and missing his date was a horrible way to introduce the sequel.  The film had it's moments and it wasn't bad all the way through, hence the three stars.
0385535139|3.0|I am amazed that the Kindle Edition of a book can cost more than the actual hardcover. Isn't this a little bit ridiculous? Does that not defy the whole idea of reading things electronically, so that we stop chopping down trees and burn oxygen and create pollution in pulp manufacturing plants? I know this is perhaps not the right forum for this squawk but i really think it is a rip off to pay that amount for an electronic version of the book. REALLY!! (Bertus van den Heever - South Africa)
B005CM9DX6|5.0|Heritage is one of those albums that is going to really split the fans.  It has some of the least accessible material ever done by the band on it and demands a lot from the listener.  This is an album that requires you to come in with an open mind and a love of music in general.  I had somewhat mixed feeling myself on the first listen to it, but the ideas here really grew on me and got me interested in music that were totally new to me.  Heritage is really an appropriate name because I don't think Opeth have ever had the opportunity to express all of their heritage before.  They have usually shown more of the sides of themselves that are easiest to grasp and left the obscure in the background as subtle aftertastes.  Those are the elements of Opeth that this album focuses on.  This album is definitely not a Damnation sequel or like anything else they have done.  It sounds more like Yes or King Crimson except twisted and evil.  I'd even say this is darker in tone than Watershed was.  If you weren't convinced before, Opeth proves here that you don't need death growls or insane distortion to sound heavy.  The atmosphere will draw you in and bring you into a world that, while dark and evil, still feels eerily human and familiar.  The subtlety in every song creates music that is truly special and worth many more listens.  I love this album, but it isn't perfect.  Transitions in some songs(Haxprocess especially) can be too awkward at times and I have a pretty high tolerance for that sort of thing.  There are a few examples of lyrics that put a sour taste in your mouth, which is weird because Opeth's lyrics are usually one of their strengths.  \\"Hey you, will you be true\\"... I know you can do better than that Mikael!  For these reasons and what the album demands of you, I wouldn't recommend this to a new listener of the band.  If you are trying to get into Opeth for the first time, Blackwater Park is an album that will give you a good taste of the many sides of the band.  Overall though, Heritage is an amazing experience.  Many bands tend to write in cycles.  If Still Life was what led to Blackwater Park, I think Heritage is going to lead to an album that has the same kind of impact.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|The quick verdict - disappointing.  Sure, \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is a good pop/rock album; but for a band with so much potential, this effort lacks the strong choruses needed to propel their ideas to the next level.  The vocal lines are placed second in the priority list here; so when Chris Martin proclaims \\"It Hurts Like Heaven,\\" the listener merely recognizes that song's title but fails to connect with it in any substantial way.  And so goes the whole album.  Whereas 2008's \\"Viva La Vida (Or Death And All His Friends)\\" was ambitious in that it experimented with world music and hints of dream pop, \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" feels like a half-hearted attempt to recapture the sound from the outstanding \\"X & Y\\" (2005) with loads of 80's synth-pop and splashes of electronica.    The problem with this project(?) - it is content to be simply good, not great.  For a band that has embraced the `unfair' comparisons to U2 at times, aiming for mediocrity will not achieve them superstar status.  While the absurd Coldplay vs. U2 debate on the internet continues, it doesn't help Coldplay fans' case when U2 gave the world \\"The Joshua Tree\\" as their fifth studio album - meanwhile, Coldplay's fifth effort is this weirdly titled lukewarm pop album.  There is no comparison!  At this point, Coldplay seems destined to be like The Doobie Brothers, America and The Steve Miller Band in that those classic rock acts are remembered far more for their greatest hits albums than their original studio records.  It is downright odd that fellow Brit-rock band Embrace (which was ironically aided by Coldplay in their success) have a masterpiece in their fourth album called \\"Out Of Nothing\\" (2004), yet the world still waits for Coldplay to equal such a feat.  While some regard \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" as brilliant; in truth, it is an average album that captures a band in transition and is quite uneven.    With the albums \\"Viva La Vida\\" and \\"Mylo Xyloto,\\" one has to question their decision making process.  Example One - the disastrous use of paired and hidden tracks on the former project.  Why was \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\" (which was the most exciting track) hidden behind \\"Yes\\" (which was the dullest track)?  Why wasn't the lovely \\"Reign Of Love\\" given its own track number instead of being paired with the popular \\"Lovers In Japan?\\"  \\"Chinese Sleep Chant\\" would have been an incredible opening track; meanwhile, \\"Reign Of Love\\" ends up being forgotten as some kind of reprise to another song.  To make matters worse, their 2008 album fumbles its finale by adding yet another hidden track after the powerful \\"Death And All His Friends.\\"  It is the equivalent of suppressing a touchdown celebration until referees have taken three minutes to determine whether a player did in fact score or not.    Example Two  -  the unnecessary introduction tracks on \\"Mylo Xyloto.\\"  Why is the track \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" separate from \\"Hurts Like Heaven?\\"  Why is the track \\"M.M.I.X.\\" separate from \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall?\\"  Why is the track \\"A Hopeful Transmission\\" separate from \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart?\\"  Instead of six tracks, it should only be three.  The band appears to be overly conscious of how fans view their material and there is an implied concern that audiences have little patience these days for embellished introductions.  Using this methodology, U2 would've cut \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\" into two parts by making the first 1:46 of that classic song its own track.  Thankfully, that didn't happen!  The real question for Coldplay is - why bring in Brian Eno to add his distinct ambient rock sensibilities and then make it so easy for listeners to skip over those tracks to the more accessible (and mainstream) songs?  This inexplicable approach undermines all their work.    Make no mistake though - the band is clearly comfortable in its own skin more so than the last outing.  \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is a pleasant sugary dose of optimistic candy.  While the potential is still there for Coldplay to deliver us their grand masterpiece; for now, solid glossy pop will have to do.  The most notable tracks here are:  \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall,\\" \\"Charlie Brown,\\" \\"Up With The Birds\\" and \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart.\\"  Hopefully next time, the album's title will be something less strange as combining the name of a Scottish electronica artist with a fictionalized instrument - xylophone toes.  Mylo's debut album was called \\"Destroy Rock & Roll\\" incidentally.  Does this mean more pop and less rock from Coldplay in the future?  If it's honest and interesting, then I'll be fine with wherever they go next.
0764141201|5.0|A real comprehensive phrasal verb list.  Great book for anyone who wish to come to grips with two o three words verbs, at an upper intermediate/advance level ESL. Usually learning phrasal verbs is a difficult task for all students, because, on the very beginning we are introduced with just a few of them. An then, multiple meanings.  On this books, each chapter focuses on a grammar pivotal point, then a list of verbs related is shown, with easy to understand explanations, a clear in-context examples. Real life examples! A chapter ends with a lot of exercises. Some of them, goes back to previously learned verbs.   A total of 50 chapters covers more than 400 verbs and its different meanings and usage. 400+ pages, hundreds of exercises.  A must!
B005974CNA|5.0|While they are never in the spotlight, Dream Theater has been one of the most talented musical acts for over 20 years! Going through small changes here and there every album they have recorded has been a good listen. Over the past decade however I felt that Dream Theater had gone into its artist like `Blue Period' From 2001-2009, the band had seemed to be stuck in some kind of rut with very dark and very edgy music. Not, that I am saying that any of it was bad, but by the time `Octovarium' was released I was curious if were possibly witnessing the beginning of the end.<br /><br />After `Black Clouds & Silver Linings' was released something happened that changed this band and that was Mike Portnoy's exit. Though he tried to come back the band said no and they handed the sticks over Mike Mangini and their new album pretty much sells the whole story of what happened this past year. `A Dramatic Turn of Events' is awesome, the band has finally come out with the album us fans have been waiting for. It is a great listen, a mixture of classic Dream Theater sound like `Falling into Infinity' and `Awake' The sound of Dream Theater that I thought was lost has come back in a great way. All the songs on this album are great to listen to, but as always some are better than others. Forget the fact that Portnoy is gone, I promise you won't miss him. Definitely pick up the special edition as you will get a great DVD that shows a documentry of the search for the new drummer.<br /><br />I have no idea what to expect from Dream Theater in the future, but for now I am going to stick with what they gave me.

B004LWZW42|3.0|The X-MEN films are a very important piece of the whole comic book film phenomenon of the past 10 years. Unfortunately after X2, the X-MEN films themselves were only sub-par. I was a little concerned with this prequel/reboot, but I have to admit I got quite a surprise.<br /><br />`X-MEN: First Class', while it is not a accurate origin story compared to the comic books, it is a well done origin story of the X-MEN film universe. What made this film work so well was the time that was put into the characters. You actually get connected with them especially Mystique & Magneto. What made these characters so believable was the actors and they were all great. James MacEvoy, Michael Fastbender, Jennifer Lawrence, hell even Kevin Bacon was great. If Kevin Bacon is in a movie these days, there has to be something right with it.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed the X-MEN films in the past, then definitely give this one a try.  It does have a few weak points, but it is a fun film none the less.
0062101897|5.0|For any Harry Potter fan, this is something you must add to your collection. It covers literally every topic under the sun in the making of the movies of Harry Potter, and it is all laid out beautifully in this enormous volume. I am in awe of the sheer amount of content. I read it for about an hour and a half on the day I received it, and I made an incredibly small dent. Though it does not include the props and replicas that \\"Film Wizardry\\" has, but this is intended to be more of an encyclopedia; \\"Page to Screen\\" goes into depth on topics that its predecessor only touched upon. The price may seem steep, but it's worth every penny.

I highly recommend this app over the alternate.
0446582778|5.0|Me agrada la manera de recrear el ambiente posterior a los disturbios por Rodney King. Se asemeja más a una crónica que  a una novela de ficción. Lo cual enriquece, con mucho, la trama. La disfruté a fondo porque me acercó más al perfil del personaje principal, Harry Bosch, que, como siempre, se atiene a sus princpios: todos cuentan o nadie cuenta. Bien por Harry!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is just a great game. It's fun, easy to use/play, and it has a lot of variety. Also, It doesn't carry ads or install a bunch of internet-game-community junk (like fruit ninja). Works great on my google nexus 1. It was unplayable on skytex alpha tablet (we returned the tablet and are considering a kindle fire instead).
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|seemed good to start, but was changing the values in my premade spreadsheets. They sent me a link to download the newest version, but I had to pay $15 dollars again to download it.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I love how the picture quality is crisp and clear.  I've always loved this movie.  So happy I own it on Blu-Ray now.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|works great, didn't had the chance to test other programs, but I don't think they are much different, you should buy, I got it for free
1451629184|2.0|With no disrespect intended, in terms of the story and tragedy that occurred, this book is lacking. Granted, this woman is amazing having survived an ordeal that would have likely killed the masses, it falls short. Duggard is writing the book from a 5th grade level - the age in which she was kidnapped. The book often feels like a child is narrating and falls short on the notion of how an adult would have seen the situation. After each chapter there is a \\"reflection\\" which gives hope that Duggard will revamp the story from the standpoint of an adult with more intelligence but often she is still just the confused little girl in the body of a 31 year old. Now, I was forewarned the story would be like this via the introduction where she self-admits the book is a work in progress, much like her own life. A large portion of the book is dedicated to poems and ranting questions on loneliness. Much of the book focuses on her want for her mother, but it is Duggard herself who paints the woman to be less than mother of the year. The first chapter opens with her mother falling short on a promise to kiss her good morning, an 11 year old making her own school lunch and being trapped with a stepfather who openly hates her. How can Duggard want for a woman so badly who seems so disconnected to her child? Duggard is a cat lover and even that statement is one understated. There are tales of probably 20 different cats she encounters and how they are the #1 thing in her life, aside from the interjection of the daughters she has birthed. About halfway through the book you will get quite sick of open-ended and unanswered questions in regards to loneliness (isn't the point of this book to answer our question and not create more?) and how important her animals are to her - arguably to keep her sane in the situation. As a reader you want to scream at her to run, kick and fight rather than do just that for her sick kittens and not the daughters that were fathered and are being raised by an accused child molester and rapist. As a graduate psychology student I enjoyed the book for an in-depth look on what Jaycee herself lived through. I picked up the book looking for the sordid little details the media left out and felt quite disappointed. Duggard's details are in her animals and of course, stricken with Stockholm syndrome, her fascination with her captor. In one chapter she casually jumps to a story talking about how she is permitted to leave the residence she has been chained to after years of being tortured! You would think this would be a climax of the book but is rather overlooked and quickly told, leaving us wanting more. Even the story of her being \\"discovered\\" is quite dull and I found myself more intrigued with an essay I came across on wikipedia rather than this 280+ page book. If you followed this story in the media like I did, save yourself the time of reading this book - you already have more details from the MSNBC report than you will find in here. One of Duggard's goals upon escaping was to become a best selling author. Congrats, Duggard, you did it. And while the story is deserving of such a title your ability to write is not.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|hands down my favorite version of \\"St. James Infirmary.\\"  It is definitely piano blues; therefore, several of the songs are better to listen to rather than dance to. However, what makes it great is the variety of sound and emotion of the songs.  One of the few cds I keep in my car and am willing to listen to over and over again.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|It's always a challenge to successfully adapt a beloved classic novel into a film, maintaining the plot and spirit of the story. Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice accomplished this amazingly well. Aside from a few necessary omissions due to time constraints (and yes, a couple of small changes - which I think worked for the better on screen), this version adheres to the original story faithfully. The casting and acting was superior on all accounts. Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen have scorching hot chemistry. I am typically not a huge fan of Knightly, but I think she took on the character of Lizzie superbly. Brenda Blethyn had me laughing out loud at her portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Donald Sutherland is very touching in his role as Mr. Bennet, and the actresses rounding out the Bennet family performed flawlessly, even though two of them (Talulah Riley and Carey Mulligan) had practically no acting experience before this film was made. I don't even need to mention Judi Dench - we all know she is one hell of an actress.  Beyond the story and characters, the cinemetography is absolutely breathtaking. This film is like a painting come to life. You can freeze-frame almost any shot in this entire film, put it on canvas, and hang it on your wall. It's THAT good. This film is a feast for the eyes if there ever was one. Hats off to Joe Wright and the entire crew for their work of art in motion.
055380684X|3.0|After reading this book, and I read it based on a recommendation, I learned a bit about Myelin and the chemical importance in your body. Besides that, the rest of the book is a guess about the future results of atheletes and students. Incredibly funny, he uses some \\"not so great\\" athletes as examples of this talent code. Anna Kournacova and Jamarcus Russell?? seriously underperforming atheletes that time has proven. I'd like to believe this \\"genie in a bottle\\" discovery and he does make some interesting points about soccer players and baseball players on the international stage. In summary, there simply isn't enough proof besides \\"hard work\\" that this chemical helps create outstanding individuals.
1582406723|5.0|I have been a fan of comics for years, but I never really liked anything from the \\"horror\\" genre. This book is labeled horror but it is so much better, it's a lot along the same lines as the Romero movies, it definitely makes you think.
1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine, the 'bird', had her children wrapped up under her wing, covered in darkness, rather than have them 'fly' freely, as a bird would do. I love the irony. What's peculiar is one stuck on the thought of him or herself  living a life of sameness. I held on to my pillow as my body tingled, right before I turned the page to see a photograph. I sat at the edge of my chair, at the end of every chapter, with my eyes wide open. It's funny how moments, unpredictable ones, can change one's life. The author is a marvelous story teller.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|I have nothing against the movie Green Lantern but I think the \\"digital copy\\" is a joke and not a very funny joke. In the future I will avoid buying any movie associated with the ultraviolet digital copy.  It does not run well and I have to be connected to the internet to access it.  What about when you are traveling in a car or on a plane and want to watch a movie. It is useless.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|Wish there was a sequel to this amazing film. It moves me every time I watch it. Thanks to Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant (and the other talented actors as well) for this heart-opening film. There is a sense of peacefulness in their love (as well as that of the sister and her fiance) that is unusual, making this film life-changing art. What are the elements that make it so great? The British accents certainly don't hurt, but Grant's intelligent androgyny and Roberts' intelligent female strength make this an evolved kind of love, and there's the magic. More, please!
B005HXGE9G|5.0|There is no more hardcore fan of Peter Gabriel than I.  I wept when he left Genesis, exaulted when his solo material equalled and exceeded that of his former band, and listened in amazement as his pallette grew and bloomed.  However, the achievements put to digits on \\"New Blood\\" show a depth and breadth to Peter Gabriel as an artist unparalleled by anything he has ever done before - even though this material is all reworking of old pieces.  Reworking is too simple a word.  Reinvention?  Resuscitation?  Reanimation, perhaps, because these pieces live and breathe as they never have before.  For those who express disappointment that this isn't another world/funk/rock work, move along...buy Brittany Spears' newest release, pop another bottle of Jagermeister, and keep your minds closed.  This is ART in it's finest sense.  For those who cherish new experiences and intellectual stimulation in addition to shaking their asses, THIS is the work to buy...to listen to again and again...and to love.
