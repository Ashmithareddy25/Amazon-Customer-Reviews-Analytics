B00HWIF4TA|5|Very cute. Good quality. Flattering fit.
B00CAXR0BW|5|Fits as expected.
B00KXEW9XE|5|It fits perfectly.  I'm 5'3 and there is still room in the onesie if I grow.  It's very soft and comfy. The hood is roomy.  Everywhere is roomy but still fitted  (if that makes sense).<br />Note: It doesn't have pockets, so I'm making some.
B004B5BSRY|4|First time ordering &#34;Boyshort&#34; swimming trunks on line and I have no complaints.  Comfortable and like the velcro pocket inside to put money, key, etc....Would buy again.
B004RWTWQA|5|Really, really great quality shirt. It washes up nicely too. This is my daughter's new favorite shirt, just try getting it from her to wash. Would definitely order again.
B003IHJ13O|5|I range between a 36-38 and I have owned a pair of these before. I bought a size 36 and the comfort bands on the side make them fit perfectly. I will be buying more of these in the future.
B00OKS3K0A|1|Too small
B0072IHQEQ|5|Great looking coat. Well-made. Very nice and tailored. Washes well.
B008YMEVKQ|5|So far it seems to be holding up just as good as leather.
B0046ED6H0|3|Not as fitting as I would like. I Had some Carhartt jeans at one time that I loved but can't find them anymore.
B00JGN40J4|5|I am a professional photographer who specializes in newborn and baby photography, so I purchase clothing and props pretty often. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this adorable little outfit! It is perfect. I would recommend it for really big newborns or for ~3-5 month olds, though.
B00T3IWFKI|2|Great looking, but two buttons came off right of the bag
B009PSAUJ4|5|This is a great hat. Good fit and quality. For the price, you can't beat it!
B00GB00TBI|5|Exactly what I wanted. Extremely warm for how light it is. I'm 6'1, with very long arms, and was worried  not ordering XLTall, but fit is great! Extremely pleased, and came sooner than expected! Carhartt quality for under $60, = GREAT DEAL!
B003DKN5C4|5|These pants are casual yet dressy! Washed the pants in cold water, shrunk a lot - don't worry when ironed went back to correct length! Great pants - great buy!!
B00J9UYOXG|5|I received this dress for Mother's Day and it is now a staple for hot days and for a cover up at the pool.  The straps are wide enough to accommodate a bra (thank you).
B000TGSEGM|4|I like it, it fits just a little bit larger than I expected but it doesn't bother my happiness, I like it. I would buy more
B00J357FM4|3|Extremely sheer looking bordering on looking cheaply made.  But it's quite nice and served it's purpose
B00FPP1JNC|3|Pretty dress but fit a bit on the small size.  length is too long as well and will have to get shortened.
B00MPCLOGA|5|Gr8 fit.....
B00JQ40704|2|The length is perfect, but the dress is very slim. The L has less than 40 inches in bust circumference, and everywhere else is slimmer than that. A Large will generally fit me, and I had high hopes for this light summer dress. But the dress is way too slim to be on normal sizes. So, if you are a slim girl, you'll be fine, if you're not, make sure you get that cm sizing converted to inches. Save yourself the trouble.
B000YT6W6I|5|I am very ummm... blessed? in the headlight department. Of course, my husband loves it, but it has always made me feel super self-conscious (unless I'm in Vegas).     I also thought the price of these was high, but I have had a pair for at LEAST a year and they are still in excellent condition. I wear them almost every day, exercise with them, wear them under a swimsuit, wear them under thin tank tops or camis with thin \\"shelf\\" bras and they are WONDERFUL. You do need do wear them under a shirt that is fairly form-fitting or they may fall off, because there is no adhesive, but I have not had any problems unless a shirt is really loose/blousey.    I do a quick wash with soap & water after exercising, otherwise I really don't do anything except throw them in the drawer. I have never actually stored them in their package or anything. They're super durable, and easy to put on.     They truly allow me to make any (form fitting) dress or shirt bra-less. I will definitely replace them when they wear out, but based on their condition, I'd say I have at least 6 months-year (unless they all of a sudden start to deteriorate rapidly).
B00JLOEZXO|3|Returned
B00L2RY312|5|This dress is fantastic! The colors are great! It is perfect for the beach!<br /><br />Another person said that it did not fit a large breasted person but I am a DD and it fits perfectly!
B00E3UZT5Y|4|You get what you pay for. Fits very nicely.
B008YCRKH2|5|I know how they run now.
B00KGRXZ1S|5|Great design and when I wear it I feel I am wearing my feelings about the world on my sleeve or... chest.
B0049RCEQI|5|Surprisingly very good quality for the money!  This money-clip/front pocket wallet is great.  This has enough card slots to hold several debit/credit cards, a clear ID pocked, as well as additional slots for misc cards, papers, etc.  I doubled up my cards to fit two in each slot. This however is quite a tight fit at the moment.  I am sure after a little wear and time it will loosen up and be easier to pull the cards out.  The clip to hold money has so far maintained a good grasp.  Over all I am quite satisfied and enjoy this product!
B005MRYTE4|3|I was looking for a tail that wasn't made with real fur and this was the only realistically colored one I could find.<br /><br />This thing sheds and is kind of wonky shaped.<br /><br />You definitely get what you pay for.
B004F1EBUK|1|I will never again use this vendor.  I placed my order in January and is nearly March my grandson has not recieved these sleepers yet.
B007XUJHDQ|5|Love them!
B00CPRP6GO|5|The material of the kilt is very good, and luckily the size that I ordered fitted me well.
B00KHJPAR2|4|The Jacket is too small for my daughter, so I will return it.
B004A58IFA|5|Great deal, no complaints!
B00UMTI5EC|5|This bathing suit looked great on!  Very flattering!
B00LUQ69SU|3|don't like the way the collars look. They crunch up and overall just look funny . Very thin sweat
B000EF1J92|5|These locks are great for travel.  Very secure, easy to operate and have enough room between lock and flange to accomodate any type of luggage.
B00B2L82S8|5|I am 170lbs, 5'7 , this jeans fit very good, fabric feels really good quality, will buy again.
B000LXQ08M|4|The jeans fit as expected.  The color was as expected.  The requirements for the reviews are too onerous for me.
B0052W12VM|4|These pants are mixed. The fabric is very comfortable but the fold over flap is annoying while working out. The fit is a bit snug on the legs but not too short or grossly tight. Not too bad overall.
B00ACIGH20|5|Product is great fit as expected
B003U6DPOO|2|I had tried this bra on in a store to be sure of ordering the correct size.  Looks nice and fit well however I have a comfort issue with it.  Under the arms where the cup meets the strap there is a mesh like material that just kind of sticks out and rubs.  I would not buy again.
B000T32AOM|5|I'm usually a 36C and decided to go up to a 38C -- perfect fit. Very comfortable high quality bra. I wish they had it in White in my size! :-(
B005F9G1HW|4|not as soft as some of my favorite socks, but I love them. I have slightly big calves so they are definitely tighter.  But being a size 3 pant size, they should fit anyway.
B0050UPABE|3|They are ok
B00AZEPDO4|4|Just what I was looking for - no decoration, comfortable, fits well. The material was similar to that of sweat pants, but very light and thin, not bulky or hot.  I did like that.
B000VQDX3E|5|gotta love cosy socks in the winter.  I think they are bigger than I thought... so maybe a smaller size.
B00BMVIPDK|4|Worked Great
B000GHMQWC|5|Light weight, great fit. Bought 3 pair.. love the 2 pockets on the legs, left for flashlight and right for cell phone.
B00I1AE9VM|5|Great shirt given the price.
B000I8XZ2Y|1|Cap does not fit over your teeth and just falls right out.  There is no adhesive and is just a clip that you have to bend to get on.  Once on, you can't re-bend it to clamp and it just falls off.
B00SYWMKHM|5|I ordered it and received an e-mail the next day asking for my measurements. Vivienne answered my questions right away. I received the dress in about 3 weeks! It is stunning! The material is a very nice quality and the workmanship is very detailed. The beading and lace are exquisite! I love how the lace cascades down the skirt and goes around the bottom. The beading at the waist is very pretty too. It fits perfectly and with the laced back instead of a zipper, you can adjust it as needed. It is so wonderful to receive such a quality, custom-made product so inexpensively and quickly. I cannot wait to wear this dress!
B00653YXMC|3|Recently ordered Santa Grinch costume.  Looking at the picture online, looked like a complete outfit.  However, upon receiving item was disappointed to discover that the legging or bottom half of outfit did not come with it.  Have yet to find same color of hose, leggings or pant bottom to match green shade of mask & glove/hands on outfit.  Have looked in department stores, halloween stores & even local retail stores, still no luck.  For the expense, i am disappointed in the quality of the suit.  The mask is nice although, i'm certain that it will be a grinch of a night after keeping it on without much airflow.  If you want the santa grinch, yes, this is the costume but; it is extremely OVER priced.
B005GYGGTE|5|I have a long waist and it is hard for me to find leggings that are not too short in the crotch.  These are perfect for me.  I wore them to the gym and then stayed in them all day.  They were so comfortable, not see thru and presentable.  I didn't feel awkward in them at the gym.  I am 5'4&#34; and bought a medium in size.
B00N1T00OS|1|I ordered a large, but the item was so small. it is a child's shirt. I would not order from this vendor again.
B008MC2L9Q|5|great shirt, thanks
B004R8RK4K|5|thank you
B00S86WR1I|1|The picture makes it look like a dress. It doesn't even come close.
B00JHGV9Q2|5|Excellent Shirt.. beautiful color...
B000FZVM4I|5|I got a fab deal on this coat.  I ordered a XL but it was to big.  I need a large.  I would say order a size smaller then what you wear.
B00FJO2BL8|3|I used the hat at the beach, it got wet, and now the rim does not hold up anymore.
B00CBDHTSU|4|I purchased this just to use on a cruise where there was a Hawaiian themed event.  I read other reviewers concern over the size and decided to go with XL instead of Large as I usually do.  I am glad I did, the cut is not very well designed and I found in some areas it was an XL and others it's a large, the shoulders for example are typical of a large shirt and the mid section is XL.  The length is that of a medium.  I am 6' tall, 205lbs and I think I was stretching a comfortable fit with an XL.  If you are over 6' you will have to wear a tucked in t-shirt.<br /><br />The good, it did fit and I even wore it one other time on the cruise.  The fabric is light and breaths well so for a muggy, 85ish and humid climate it was nice to have.
B002IFT4G6|3|My wife bought this coat in black and it served her well during New York's rainy winter.  But after she'd worn it just a few times all of the buttons were very loose and falling off.  She had to re-sew them all, along with one of the belt loops, which pulled out of the coat and left the belt dragging.  Such a waste of time....  We expected better workmanship from a London Fog; obviously quality control is a problem in their factories.  If you buy one of their coats, be prepared to get out a needle and thread.
B0008DV5G2|5|My medium frame sits right in the middle between large and medium so I always buy a medium whenever I can, but sometimes medium clothes will be a little too tight and I have to then try on the large size. Since I am of average size, medium can sometimes be somewhat tight, and then a large can sometimes still be too loose. But selecting the right size Rothco M-65 VINTAGE field jacket was easy to figure out.<br /><br />What the other reviewers say about the sizing for these jackets having a tendency to be too big is accurate because the jacket is intended to be used with an inside liner installed. But the jacket is not sold with a liner, which must be ordered in addition to the jacket. Buying the jacket in your size without a liner, then the jacket will probably feel too big. Since I always try to wear a medium, I ordered a medium, and then I also ordered a liner for it. Without the liner, the medium looks and feels big on me. However, with the liner installed, at least it doesn't feel too big, and the insulation takes up the extra space, and I'm sure this jacket will do exactly as I expect of it when the winter temps begin to drop way below freezing.<br /><br />But, I also ordered one of these vintage jackets in small, without a liner, and it still fits my medium frame perfectly. I do not intend to be putting a liner in this jacket because a liner will then make the jacket too small for me. So when they say to buy a size smaller, that is only if you don't intend to use a liner in the jacket. BTW these jackets are somewhat heavy and well insulated without a liner. My locale doesn't get a lot of snow and the temps for most of the winter will not drop more than a few degrees below freezing, so this jacket without the liner will probably be just fine for all but the very coldest months of the winter -- which is exactly why I bought the other jacket -- with a liner.<br /><br />Along with several different brands of this very popular M-65 design, there are also different materials used for these jackets from Rothco. So if you want an all-cotton M-65 then select the VINTAGE model. If the Rothco M-65 doesn't say vintage, then it uses a poly-cotton blend. To provide even more confusion, there are also LIGHTWEIGHT VINTAGE M-65 field jackets that are all-cotton, but the storm flap and pockets all have buttons instead of snaps. And also, the lightweight jacket is not intended to be used with a liner. Pricing for all of them is about the same, so be careful about just exactly which one you are selecting to put in your cart. I would suggest spending a little time researching whats available to help make the best choice for one of these wonderful classics.ts from Rothco.

B008Q23OP2|5|This is a great hat, quality and fits just right.. Will be buying another soon thanks!
B00HI2MZLA|5|i was a bit hesitant about buying these since I couldn't try them on obviously but I was shocked by how comfortable they are. best leggings I've ever owned and for only $5!!!! they're stretchy and soft but if you want to wear them they're kind of see through so wear a long shirt / a dress.
B00QJYQSP2|5|great
B00XBN3T7O|5|If ordering these I would go one size bigger on the waist than what you would normally. My normal waist size would have been too small, one size bigger and they fit. Good quality material overall worth the money.
B00GJXXI9W|5|I thought these were going to be too small when I saw them but the stretch nicely and even slim my &#34;muffin top.&#34; As far as I know they aren't see through. Very cute, I'm 5&#34;2' and the length is perfect
B00L4FUGQS|5|great fit and price
B009AM51VW|5|It's not every day a person sets out to purchase Lederhosen from Amazon; I was relatively uncertain of what I was actually going to get but was thrilled with the product. The lederhosen was well made, 100% leather, lined, and came with extra buttons plus leather cord. My only suggestion is when you purchase realize that it is leather and that you will probably want to wear them around the house to break them in. For me, personally, I decided to go with one size larger than my actual size so I have a little growing room as I age. Leather does stretch over time though, so you would know best what was going to work for you. Overall I feel as though this is an excellent product, reasonably priced, and I received it in 3 days.
B00C0PG8AY|5|Loved family costumes!
B0002H6XNE|5|This is a gift for my dad for Father's Day and it is perfect.  He is constantly chasing the squirrels off the bird feeder and I know he is going to love this shirt.  Typical t-shirt material - haven't washed it yet as it hasn't been given yet but seems fine.  Typical sizing.
B001LNGEK0|5|I don't usually write reviews, but because I use them so much, I figured I should start!  These thermal shirts are exactly what I was looking for.  Very true to size- I am 5'3 125lbs, and I got the small.  It still fits very well (form fitting but not too tight) even after washing. Great for layering! Very good quality for the price! I have 3 now and I'm sure I'll order more in different colors!
B0018OHB8Q|5|Nothing fits me like the Levi 505's.  Rhey are the red label jeans I've had since my teens years. I tried some Wranglers recently but there really is no comparable fit to the 505's.
B003OXTPM4|1|Nice shirt but. . . . .  the Mustang and wording comes pre faded out while the Ford decal at the bottoms appears to be a add on heat transfer decal.  To me it's a poor copy of the real thing. . . this looks nothing like the one you see for sale at a Mustang Rally
B0088P2C28|5|These are great for the colder weather when wearing a hoodie or sweater is just a bit much. Long sleeved plain tees are not all that easy to find for a low price and these are just perfect.
B003G5Q9TM|5|I wear them all the time. Will definitely order again
B002G9UDEQ|5|I gave this Christmas present early to my son as he needed a warm shirt to go outside for a few hours. He absolutely loves it. The only problem I have with it is it ordered black as he asked for a black hoodie sweatshirt. This is definetly dark brown and not black. He refuses to give it up so I'm back here ordering black! I hope this is not what they are calling black. The outside said black. I really think it was mis labeled.  I'll let you know if this is really brown or black when I get the next one!  This one is really a beautiful dark brown.
B00B1CW162|2|It fits pretty good but the color is not at all what it shows here. That was the biggest part that I was looking forward to so it has me a bit disapointed.
B00INM4ZWG|4|Underwear is small I fixed the size doing crochet. I got the medium size I'm 118lb 5.4f. Beautiful bikini
B00L5OWWMO|5|Love em'
B00F0UWBT8|4|It doesn't came any smaller than a size 8 but will be OK for sunbathing. Seems kind of strange that there is no 6 or 4.
B008SJ9EOI|5|These are a fantastic buy! I've been looking for a resonable priced snow pant for awhile. These are high quality and about half the price of something you'd find at Dicks.,
B000F8YCUG|4|I am 52 years old and have a bust size of 40 DD.  I bought this bra for comfort - at the end of the day, etc. Do not buy this bra for support but for comfort it is great! I would buy another.
B00ABDRQE4|2|I ordered these jeans because of the Levi brand but when I got them they were at least a size too small and were very low cut. It would be helpful if in the product information they would include where these jeans sit regarding the waist like L.L. Bean does with all of their pants. I find this very helpful when ordering any type of pants. Beware of the size!
B00G3FYUN4|4|I'm wear a 7 1/8 size & it was a little large. Somewhat loose around the head but I won't exchange it as I'm afraid a small would be entirely too tight. Wish it was sold in sizes rather than s/m/l. Oh well, hopefully wear & weather will help with the fit.
B00ABAHVEW|1|Too tight fitting and just felt wrong - I wear a lot of these types of shirts, which are extremely comfortable, but this one went right back.
B00ANEXMTO|5|my daughter loves this tshirt. it fits well and is the size she wears in brand name clothing. washes well too.
B00EOS3RFE|4|Love the style, is as presented in the picture.  Too small, though.  Wish they made this in a larger size, I would re-order.
B00453PO6S|2|I know people were talking about the sleeves being slim, but they are EXTREMELY slim. Let me just say this: I am 5'5&#34; 150. I am pretty muscular with low body fat. I ordered the XL and I CANNOT fit my arms in the sleeves. Also, the waist is not form fitting and pretty wide so if you wore it, it would look like you were wearing a trash bag. It is absolutely NOT what it appears to be in the manikin. I shudder to think what would have happened if I had ordered a smaller one. Honestly, the design looks pretty nice, the fabric appears to be top notch, but the form and fitting of the waist portion seems to be misleading.  All in all, stay away!
B004HE19DC|5|Hello, I really do not know what this person was thinking rating this product 1 star but to each his own.    2 years ago I developed in my lower area a perennial abscess and a fistula. I had never had something like this happen before to me. Over the course of 2 years I had 3 surgeries and one minor touch up you can say. This was a painful and excruciating experience to say the least but lo and behold I cam across this product.    Since I was discharging fluids often this came in very handy. The first time I put the underwear on I felt a cooling sensation which I have not really felt with other underwear. I am only 38 so I was a bit skeptical since I never had to use 'special' underwear before. Well feeling the cooling made me relaxed and open to continue using it. The fit was a bit snug where the openings for the legs are but shortly thereafter my legs got acclimated to it and no more problems. It fit perfect across my waist always and was easy to put on and take off.    Needless to say this product kept me from embarrassing moments. The absorbent panel does absorb a lot of fluid. Believe me I know! Over time I purchased more and they just continued to work for me. I should mention it is very soft cotton and latex free. I could have it on for hours and it felt OK. I would recommend this for anyone with incontinence or occasional fluid discharge. I thank GOD I found this because it really did help.    Finally since this product is treated with a special chemical called 'Fabrapel' which will repel fluid it is important to wash and dry the correct way. Do not use detergent or the 'Fabrapel Effectiveness' will start to dissapear. Wash in cold water as directions say with non-detergent soap like the Soapberry they sell here at Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/SOAPBERRY-100%25-DETERGENT-FREE-LAUNDRY-CARE/dp/B004HLVWFU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1294090843&sr=8-2    When finished Air Dry, very important do not put in the Dryer or the effectiveness will go away. I followed thesedirections to a T and the underwear has lasted repeated washings. After 2 years my health problem is over but I will continue to use this underwear from time to time. It really is great!    I hope this review helps anyone debating whether or not to purchase this product. It definitely worked for me!. Try it, you won't regret it.     Victor
B000VAFUP4|5|Love these jeans, they have held up after many washings and certainly are appreciated on a very cold day.  Plus, they are a lot cheaper than the big name brands but are just as serviceable.  Would definitely buy again.
B004M6XUI2|4|I know you cant expect too much for a $13 wallet however this wallet has fallen a bit short in quality if you ask me. The leather wallet itself seems great and put together fine for the most part. Mine has one missed or loose stitch which is hanging off about a quarter inch or so, but that was easily dealt with. My main issue is the ID flap. It is very snug, so snug in fact that my ID got stuck inside it. While this is not unusual until the plastic wears a bit, when I went to remove the ID, the entire plastic 'window' tore out. It appears as if it was only stitched in by its very edges, making me think that this part of mine is defective. So, all in all this is a nice wallet for the cost, however there are some minor imperfections and possible defects as with any product. I will be contacting the company to see if a replacement ID window can be set as I'd rather not return the whole thing if I don't have to. I think for the price, the quality is expected however I wish it didn't fall apart day one.<br /><br />EDIT: So I contacted Swiss alpine support and they were extremely helpful. They responded in under 12 hours and are sending me a brand new wallet entirely. I don't even have to send the broken one back, so it will be a backup if needed. Because of the prompt support I have added a star.
B002PJ58DS|4|said was a large but was still a bit small or snug..
B00N2IGN0S|5|This Dress is so beautiful it is so worth the price and I got it with 3 weeks a lot  sooner than it said and the company is so nice to get back with you with any questions so happy I gave the my measurements they did great its a little big in waist area but fine they did awesome. Received on Christmas Eve what a great surprise and gift its more beautiful than the picture
B0076MFFRI|5|I had bought few T-shirts of this brand for my son.He was very happy with the fit.I had shopped for this brand on different sites,but I found that the price for them were much cheaper in Amazon.The postage charges were also reasonable.they were sent to my son before the date mentioned and it was fast.I will recommend Tommy Hilfiger T-shits to any one in doubt,whether to buy or not.
B007CVUSH0|4|This is beautiful dress for curvy woman.  My daughter is 24 and an hourglass -- vavavavoom body--  this dress was awesome but i did have to take it in so it fit better under the breast area....  then she looked like Grace Kelly.....  seriously she was beautiful in it.
B009WH2ODI|1|I was very, very disappointed with this purchase. I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband. I bought his regular size, but it was MUCH too small (and, no, he is not a t all overweight). The material was flimsy and cheap. the zipper was much too small for a man's cardigan and in any case it didn't work. I returned it because of the broken zipper, but I probably would have returned it anyway because of the shoddy workmanship and cheap material. If I'd paid only $20 for it, I still would have returned it. Amazon was great about the return, however.
B006SF27Q6|4|Great bra. Very comfortable. Was itchy at first but after a few wears I don't notice it. The 34 was a little loose on the back, could have gone down to a 32. I will to probably order another one in a 32 F instead of 34E.
B008XCNUKY|5|I was worried about these gloves not fitting my husband.  He said large and his hands are large!!!  They fit like a glove should and look great.  He's very happy.
B00KM5PSDW|4|It fits, don't get me wrong but not exactly the fit I was expecting. This will work perfectly regardless. Great buy for the price. :)
B00K8QGH5S|5|This top is very comfortable and stretchy, the size is just right ...it is perfect for work.
B00BGVRSHA|5|Been looking for this for a present for my son. Its exactly what he wanted. The product was perfect. I recommend it for everyone.
B00A6G48PQ|5|Despite all the reviews from the 'ball-smashed' this product is true to size...if you look at the size guidelines.  Usually, I wear a medium (32-34), but in this case Croota calls it Large.  If you follow the size guide Crootas will fit just fine.  Also, considering they are mostly cotton, as they warm to your body temp they will loosen a bit.  So if you are generously equipped, room will make itself available as you wear them.  Thumbs up to another great product from Oz!
B00IX96B6C|2|Xlarge ordered. So small it apeeared to be child sizing.  Very disappointing that was not able to give as xmas gift
B000UPHZB2|2|The cap is made well, but it just too tight on my head.  I do not think I will wear it, but I will keep it with me for the cold winter months where my hair should stay dry.
B00376N5B0|4|a little short but very nice overall
B00TQL0Q76|5|Saw this on Pinterest and thought it was adorable. As a teen who is not allowed to wear bikinis it's such a struggle to find affordable modest swimsuits that don't make me look five but on the other hand not like a grandma. I got a small, and I'm about 5ft. it fits wonderfully! Super happy about this product.
B00EKQBZIG|4|Great skin, I have others in different colors and I use them to snorkel in. Perfect as a light all day wear especially instead of a shortie wet suit.
B00MYNGHY4|5|Nice quality sweater.
B00FRP8V68|4|Very nice, tunic.  The neck, as it happens, is exactly as is portrayed in the photo.  It says deep, scoop neck, but it really isn't.<br />It's deep, crew neck.  I was a bit put off, at first, but after wearing it around the house for a bit, it worked out to be really comfortable.<br /><br />It's also MASSIVELY WIDE AND LONG. To give you an idea of how large, I got a Medium as I wear 1x in normal tops.  But Woman Within runs large, so I received what would be a 3x in stores.  That's the bad news. The good news is that they always shrink down if you dry them on high heat - -  a good two inches, all around this way.  So it all works out in the end.<br /><br />That said, it's probably the most perfect tunic in the world. :)  The material is much heavier than I expected, as is the construction.  I got four colors: banana, pretty violet, ruby and emerald.  All are LOVELY in person.  Think they may be too heavy to wear in summer, but they are wonderful weight for Fall and Winter.
B00GSNXPS2|5|great look both back and front the sting is small enough cant be felt
B000YQMWMO|5|I'm expecting baby number 5 and this is by far the most comfortable nursing bra I've ever owned. There's room to expand for when you are full, the band isn't too tight under the girls, yet gives good support and the material is soft, not scratchy. The cups are also comfy and not too tight. The picture had me wondering if the actual fit would be too tight. It's not. The fit is pretty accurate according to the sizing chart. I ordered exactly what the chart says I need and it's perfect. I ordered butterscotch because it's closer to my skin color (I'm Caucasian) and it did not show through a white top as a color. I have yet to find a con for this bra. It's a quality bra and worth the investment. I highly recommend this bra.
B004M6XUI2|5|smells and looks like real leather. Although the thickness of the hide or lather seemes thin. WHICH MEANS THE DURABILITY OR LONGEVITY IS A PROBLEM.  THEN GAIN IT LIKE 12 BUCKS<br />fIT MOST OF MY CARDS, HOLD CASH IN SEPARATE  SIDES. bIG ENOUGH FOR ALL YOUR WALLET NEEDS
B005GYGF54|4|These capris are perfect for the gym, lounging at home, or those days when you just don't care how lazy you look at school. They are extremely comfortable, good quality (not see through), and cute. I ordered two pairs and I'm so glad I did! I'm 5'4&#34;, average build (not overweight but not super thin) and the Medium fits great. I probably could wear a small but I don't like my workout pants super tight.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving a fifth star is because I haven't had them for long so I can't evaluate durability yet. So far I definitely recommend these pants!
B00L57R1NG|5|Love these.  The material is great and soft, and they're so cute.
B006O6116G|5|I have 2 daughters about the same age who wear about the same size.  I bought this to add to our collection because of the great price.  I definitely didn't expect for them both to love it, but they did!  I would highly recommend this as a great little dress for church, classy events or nice dinner.
B00PFIOT72|5|just as desired
B00M6J9D6K|5|SO COMFORTABLE. I purchased this same swimsuit last year....in blue. I loved it so much I bought blue and black this year.  I think the bottoms shown have ties...but the ones that come in the order have small cut outs on the side. True to size.
B004AZZGJG|4|Not bad for the price, I'd get another in a size up.
B005C1GR4K|5|It is just what I expected..It holds everything I need and I would buy more and recommend them. thank you
B001DTV14Q|3|I thought the plastic would be a bit more durable for continuous use, say for plays and such, but it turned out to be like a thin, halloween-type of plastic. Of course for the price I was not expecting a super, solid, plastic helmet, but I hoped it would have been somewhat nerf-like (if you remember nerf)so that I could pack it easily and use more often more classes, plays, and whatever events that it would require. Nonetheless, for a halloween costume or the need to put any costume together on a budget, it's still cool.
B00FR4M13I|5|Quality is as expected !
B007M8FR5G|5|Daughter immediately loved it and wanted to wear it all the time. I'm in California so we're usually dealing with light rain and this works perfectly for that climate.
B00EDTMTAS|4|Really love the look of these jeans and they have a little extra length just incase I want to wear a heel . The feel is soft and comfortable.. only thing I'd complain about is there was some edging that was a little rough on mine from the sewing .. wash them first! Fit well and did not loose shape through the day. They are thinner than I hoped for but great for a spring summer outting just not working around the yard!
B011MDA9H2|5|I am very impressed with the TL Women's 2 pack of basic cotton t-shirts.  I picked the Black and Red, as they go with so many outfits I have.  I am a tshirt and jeans kind of girl so I am always on the lookout for nice quality basic tees.  These are wonderful!!! They are so soft and feel wonderful against your skin.  They are so classic that you can wear them with jeans or slacks or under a blouse, so versatile that you can't lose with them.<br />They launder very well, and did not shrink, and I think they feel even better on once they were washed!! I highly recommend these, you won't be sorry you got them.<br />I was provided a sample at a discounted price to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.
B00F3HA3KC|1|These bottoms run very small. I measured my waist and hips and ordered the recommended size and they were way too small, and also the leg openings were too small. Considering the price I guess you get what you pay for.  I threw them in the garbage. Very unhappy with this purchase.
B00MB8INQM|2|Small
B00L7S5450|3|The picture of this product was as expected.  It's more of a mini cape.  Too small and different from what is pictured/described and I will be returning. The Seller was extremely nice and communicative.  The 3 Stars are for the Seller.
B00NPB3YM2|5|My son loves it .we ordered it and it was delivered within days.
B00C2K4QFQ|3|I like the look and feel of this bag. The material and design are quality. However, it's way too small. I had to return it because there was no room to really put anything. I wish it was bigger because I really like the look and feel but in practicality it isn't very useful do to the small size.
B00453PO6S|5|I love this hoodie....  I like the fabric and especially the design.  For someone who has not ordered before, do what I did, in that I did a lot of research regarding their sizing compared to U.S. sizing...  Do your research and you can't go wrong.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Doublju to everyone ~!  They have awesome designs.<br /><br />I am a 5'7 female and 130 lbs.  I ordered the size XL and it fits perfect.  I prefer to wear men's hoodies<br />because I like the longer lengths in hoodies.<br /><br />This company's clothing is designed for slim fit so keep that in mind as well.  All the U.S. hoodies are so wide<br />that they feel like you're wearing a tent.  I soooooo like the slim fit of Doublju and would recommend to everyone.<br /><br />:-)
B000N8X34O|3|shoulder seem don't meet up. but it very bad if it pants problem is they don't know how to check there merchandise.
B001E5OXF8|5|Even during the day this guy looked pretty crazy.  Before you buy make sure he will fit your tree.  My tree was just a bit too small in diameter and he kept sliding right down so I had to put some screws through his chin and his hands to make sure he stayed, but on the night of my party he looked pretty cool.  Also, trees are round and the underside of his hands and face are flat; good job design team.  You may have to put a screw through his face and hands anyway; up to you.
B00289XGG6|4|It looks good but made of a really light material. Not near as substantial as many of my other buckles. Drum set does look cool though.
B005442A0K|5|Everything you need and more in a hat that is easy to stow or go.<br />PimpDaddy likes it on his Electra Glide cold days. There's one hat Harley didn't get.
B00O4IU554|5|Fantastic hat.  Exceptional quality, fit and feel.
B00IXXRQ2G|4|Good for the price.
B007R1ODW6|5|bought for my husband, as he loves anything from Charlie Brown. nice cotton and very comfortable. fits perfectly! gonna keep an eye on
B008V9DLZS|5|love the the product but it's a just little bit smaller than the typical us medium size.  wat else can i say i just ordered 2 more
B004M6UD46|5|really useful
B0088EYPEC|5|excelent
B00CDBU5RC|5|I am normally a curvy size 8, and the 6 fits perfect. They're even decently long (I am 5'10&#34; and can wear with flats), but they're a perfect jean to wear with riding boots. The stretch is very comfy, and they hold their shape & don't get baggy.  This is my second pair in this style and cut.
B00GYHW0GU|5|This shirt was a b-day gift for my boyfriend. I was a little nervous about the price and not being able to feel the quality or know if it would fit good but the quality is excellent and fits just right. I have no problem paying a bit more for a good quality product and this was worth the cost.
B004BRGWBE|5|Seems to be a high quality shirt, fits perfectly with a loose, comfortable and \\"cool\\" feel to it. Perfect summer shirt. Received many compliments on it.
B000F2W0YW|1|Too small for an adult. Took 1/2 to get the feather in. Very stiff
B008VL8AW0|5|The quality of this beanie actually surprised me considering its price. The material is thick and reliable and it's very comfortable.
B00PK3V21I|5|This was super cute on my baby girl. The fabric is nice and not itchy. It washes well. Super cute in photos too!! :) Nice bright colors
B00F5BK3WY|1|I usually wear a S/M. I ordered the S thinking i would want this to be very fitted. However, I was not expecting it to be XXS. The small was SUPER TINY. You can maybe even tell on the model. The stitching for the shoulders doesnt match up with where her shoulders are its way off. Thats how the small fit me and i felt very uncomfortable.
B003APIRI4|1|While this button is definitely fun and festive, the small size was very disappointing. The measurements made it seem larger than it was, in reality.
B00I7VCYXU|3|I know they should be tight.. but not so much that skin if popping out at every hole. Order 1 size higher if you want to get theses. There nice but damn there tight
B00GQUVAOS|5|Extremely comfortable and a great fit.  Love the material
B000CQS6F8|3|I have a macbook pro 15.4\\" computer with a protective case and it wouldn't fit into this computer bag, (it might have fit without the protective case but I didn't check).  The bag seemed well made but I didn't care for the color.  It was ordered in the blue because I wanted something more casual than the dressier black.  I was surprised at the metallic/lavender sheen and decided that the color was not at all what I wanted.  I have found Mobile Edge bags to be well made and generally classy.  My hope is they will come out with a bag in a denim colored leather for everyday non-work related use. Though the bag in general was attractive, it did look like cheap imitation leather. It was returned immediately.
B00RN2R984|4|Nice shirt, good fit. Material doesn't breath as much as I would like. Live in Florida and the in the sun on a hot and humid day I sweat more in this shirt than others.
B00IMG0O50|4|Very pretty. Fits well. I like the little bells on the drawstring. What I expected in this style of skirt.
B00E6RAKIU|3|I purchased two of these tops. One is too small the other is ok.
B00E4UC6W2|5|Best cargo pants Ive ever had, really unfortunate that they discontinued them
B00SA9J5R2|5|I love this topic, perfect for Spring and Summer!
B00ST45112|5|I originally ordered a Lafter reading some reviews, but it was too big. I had to send it back for a Medium. It does run a little small. I am 5'5&#34; 118 lbs and although I normally wear a S, the M fit perfectly. The material is a stretchy knit and hugs nicely. I will wear with high waisted shorts, jeans and skirts.
B00KWRXCDI|4|It's well constructed, but pretty loose fitting, if you wear a size 18-20, like me, you might want to go with a 5x.  It's lovely though, just a bit bigger than I thought, but easy to get on, and still looks pretty good, just would order a bit smaller next time.
B006T52WVA|5|Lovely. A full coverage but not grannybat all...a style change for me and as near as I can tell no lines.
B00JY8K64O|5|I am 5'1 and if i lean over it shows a little bit of butt and it's absolutely so sexy but also absolutely adorable with the lace back. Amazing quality too.
B002EL2WZE|5|Purchased for a grab bag gift. Lucky guy!
B000FNB81W|5|I love this bathing suit.  It's very elegant looking and fits great, plus you can't beat the price.  I normally wear a 6-8 but ordered a size 10 because bathing suits can run a little snug and I'm glad I did. It fits perfect.
B00HR0NNGE|4|Good
B003HP4TVQ|4|I ordered a size way bigger than I normally wear and it fit perfect.
B0016E0TH8|1|[[ASIN:B0016E0TH8 Alki'i Misses Long Sleeve Tunic Cover up/Dress]]  Do NOT purchase this - it's flimsy polyester, not 100% cotton. The customer service is horrible. I shipped this back to the company one month ago and I still have not received a credit to my account. Buy at your own risk and make sure you send items back certified mail!
B00IBJBT7A|1|I was very unsatisfied and disappointed with this product! I payed $20 for a Hollister T-shirt that's not even a REAL Hollister brand product! This is a Hanes brand T-shirt with Hollister on it!! I could have made this T-shirt myself for less than what I payed for it!!!
B003XOOWV8|4|I was a little confused on whether to buy this hat because it only listed &#34;infant&#34; as the size. It ended up fitting my 14 month old sons head perfectly but he has a small head (25 percentile). It doesn't leave much room to grow either. It is a cute hat though and the brim is perfect- not too long so he can't see. The straps are definitely too long for any child. Tie straps would have been a better adjustable alternative.
B00CTN8C7Y|5|allgood
B00I66L66W|5|My husband bought it for me and it fits great and has gotten good feedback!
B00FEL9146|3|I purchased a bigger size thinking she would of course grow into it, and the bigger size fit well with quite a bit a shrinking noted after 2 washes
B007EEWZLM|5|great fit, my baby LOVES THEM!
B00T32G1T0|3|Very cute looks just like the pic runs small it fits me but its a little tight the top is tighter than the bottom  but the bottom is tight too I order a medium and I'm a small & it was still too tight i can  still wear it just wish it was a tad bit bigger<br />  The material is great  if u are a small 3/4 5/6 u need a large<br />  If u have big boobs  don't order it at all
B00IUU1RE0|2|It fits like a small not medium<br />Shipped very fast
B00M46ARAQ|5|i really LOVE this.  It's not super clear from the photo that the blue is very sheer.  It's just lovely- but delicate.  I'm very happy with it.  I think it's much prettier in person than it was on the website.  I'll get a lot of use out of this.
B00M51R8RK|2|Cute but material quality not good. Some stitching issues. Fabric very thin.
B00A6YTKCY|3|They fit perfectly but are see through even in charcoal. Based on the price of the item, I wasn't expecting the highest of quality item but I would expect that you could wear them without people seeing your undergarments!<br />I suppose wearing a long shirt with these will be a good solution to this problem. Just a warning if you are planning to wear these without having your backside covered by a shirt!
B003GZ7XGU|5|This may very well be the geek in me, but I wriggle like a puppy every time I put this shirt on.  I don't care that most people don't recognize the logo.  I do, and that's enough.  Some people do get it, though.  As Christopher Golden said in his introduction to \\"Oddest Jobs\\", (paraphrasing), they're the people who know what's GOOD.  Me, I'm just a giant Hellboy fan who can't get enough.  And how awesome is it that I live very near to where Mike Mignola works and started the whole thing?<br /><br />If you're like me, this really does complete the collection.  Not sure what crack Hellboy would make about it, though.  Maybe he'd just say \\"Oh, crap,\\" and leave it at that.
B00B5UDV1E|3|I am a 32 DD and it's all natural. With that being said, I had to use the duck tape method and then place the fashion form on top to give my shirt a smooth look. I was disappointed because I am pretty firm but wanted that extra lift and support, the bra gave absolutely none. However, it was true to size, hence why I gave it a 3 star instead of a 2.
B00DEVNE64|5|Husband really likes! Wears nice. Washed and no fading. Quick delivery!
B00EEBWZQ8|1|I wore this jersey and Immigration picked me up thinking I was an illegal alien from Bolivia. They threw me on a plane and I ended up on the streets of La Paz where I had to sell paco and rob tourists.
B00A6JFWZS|5|love it
B003DRLMBI|1|the toe sock part of the socks is fine;  the durability of the material is not;  one sock had a hole in the heel after 10 days' wear.
B008N6XYYW|4|Ordered a size 0: I'm 5'2&#34; and 97 lbs and they fit my legs and waist perfectly.<br /><br />They are a little long in the legs however, so I have to roll them (or sew them if I decide not to be lazy).<br /><br />They are in the wash now, so I can't comment on that yet.<br /><br />Hope that was helpful!
B000VSME46|3|Love the hat, but sizing is way off compared to company's others.
B00GNVKAM8|1|The material was completely see through, had a very low cut vee neck that left everything exposed and did not fit well at all. The color was a very bright neon orange that almost reminded me of a construction worker vest... I did not like this item at all and returned it immediately. The color is mostly what threw me off because I wasn't expecting it to be so loud, nor did I like how loosely it fit and did not flatter my body shape at all.
B008N7UE3K|5|It is true they are not a heavy thermal material, which I like because I wear them to bed.  I ordered a blue and red and the colors are really nice.  They do not shrink or fade after washing.  I'm impressed so far.
B00HFKMN08|5|Product arrived promptly and as advertised. Very pretty.
B00P1PNWMM|5|I could live in these.  They made me look and feel so slim - love it!  Thank you!
B000JTD234|5|I ordered the Men's Spandex Driving Gloves by Isotoner.  They were to replace gloves for my husband that were left behind on a business trip. The gloves arrived within a few days.  They fit well and are very comfortable.  He said they make driving easier giving him a better feel of the road.
B00HYS2NBU|2|The pants are a cheap material but u get what u pay for I guess
B0044XITXO|5|I love Greys scrubs! One of the only brands I will wear. almost wrinkle free, I never ever iron. super soft fabric too. it is a little smaller in size so keep that in mind. they are meant to hug and be a little more form fitting. love these scrubs
B003XSENZE|5|My husband is a tall guy with a size 15 foot. I cannot find socks to fit him anywhere locally, that aren't paper-thin, drop to your ankles when you walk or are so snug that they leave imprints in his skin. These socks are a God-send and we're willing to pay the extra cost.<br /><br />I bought one pair for him to try them out and he says they are wonderfully thick and soft and still are after many washes. He has fairly thick calf muscles, and these socks fit him fine. They also stay put on your calf when you pull them up. They drop slightly, but due to their thickness they don't drop far. He says he actually looks forward to wearing them each week.<br /><br />Amazon is over priced. I bought additional pairs directly from King Size and used a RetailMeNot.com online coupon, which dropped the cost to $8.50 a pair!!
B002ZG8IGK|1|I purchased 2 pairs of different colour this very same size from this same company<br />1 year ago. This year I ordered the very same colours and size and niether of them fit<br />They are both too tight.. What is up with that?!!!
B00BYMPPJO|4|Feels very comfortable, though the jersey is a bit thinner than I'd expected and it's already pilling after a few wears. I wouldn't wear it for anything more formal than running errands, but it's a good basic dress. Ruching makes this much more flattering than the average maternity maxi dress.
B009JWIL5G|5|My  husband absolutely loved it and wears it every day!!!  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this jacket for any deadliest catch fans.
B00NPYCKBA|5|Love this hat...very warm!!
B00E3OW5JS|3|I bought this shirt in three different colors for my dad for Christmas and they run too small, order larger than expected
B00DGM4DNY|4|I am closer to a size 9 but this 8fits perfectly. The arm length is great and length is nice. One thing I would like would be an additional button at the bottom so that it does not splay out as far as it does while sitting.love the color and glad to have something other than black!
B003AYCOCK|5|Love the hat and the beard wasn't too annoying to have on while &#34;celebrating&#34;.  It wasn't the coolest hat to have on running a 5k but got plenty of shout outs from the crowd.
B0069JMW3O|5|Darling coveralls - wondeful quality.  Just need a onesie to go with it!  Made well and highly recommended for toddlers.
B00BCUVQEQ|5|These fit very well and I do like the fabric.  I had tried on a pair so knew what to order.  Had that not been the case  I might have gone wrong since the sizing is a bit on the small side.
B00882UYXK|4|Other than this shirt running a little small, this is an awesome, quality shirt.
B000J3YMGQ|5|When I started to put them on I didn't think they would fit. But they fit amazingly and feel great. Also I didn't expect them to get here so early. I recommend
B00E1ZOULA|5|I was looking for a simple, semi-warm, and somewhat attractive robe with pockets, and this one exceeded my expectations! I ordered a size M (I'm 5'8\\" and ~140 lbs.) and it offered plenty of room to wrap around the front and drape a bit without being baggy. The tie is attached, which I thought might be a problem (what if it's too high or too low?), but it hits just above my natural waist, so it's narrowest in the most flattering place! There is also a tie inside to fasten the inside flap and prevent the V-neck from opening up too much. It's made of t-shirt material, but high-quality jersey, like that shirt you got ten years ago that still doesn't have much wear. Highly recommend.
B00G8ZI6SO|5|Love it!! Get compliments all the time.  I decided to actually disclose my weight cause when shopping for maternity clothes on line it's difficult to accurately assess sizes. I'm 32 weeks, 5'7&#34; pregnant with second pregnancy so my bump is big and I'm 203 lbs.  got a Large and fits great! Room for belly to grow which is great plus I can tell when nursing inthe fit will adjust nicely.  Plus this is very flattering!
B003IH5P4S|5|Wore this wig with my hippie outfit for halloween. It was a hit !. I stuffed it inside with paper towels to lift up. I also bought a 10 string of battery power flower lights and placed it around. It look awesome !!
B009BD9H9C|5|Excellent value for the money, this hat is flashy, sturdy build, I get great comments when wearing it, and it gives a shout out for the first black and best President of the United States. This hat is not for silly Teapublicans/Republicans they lack the class and smarts for wearing it! Get this hat and wear it, is a great value.
B00IL5ROLO|5|Love it-just wish the cotton was softer
B000M9O4FG|3|i don't want to write a review. when i type the letters don't come up on the screen until after i submit it, and then i have to edit it again. what a pain in the a**.
B0058LTVDS|4|This is a fun FASHION corset.  The fabric is soft inside and has a nice faux leather look.  It's not super heavy fabric, so you may see the line of your waistband if you are wearing something underneath.  The busk (clasps down the front) are steel.  I'm not sure if the boning is plastic or spiral steel bones, but either way, they are really flexible, so this is certainly NOT a tight lacing corset or anything like that.  If you are wanting significant waist reduction, look elsewhere.  It is nice for a bit of a nip in the waist.  It's more straight across the top than sweetheart, but I still like it.  For the price, it's great.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because I wish there was boning between the laces and the back opening.  This would give the corset a but more structure and keep the laces from stretching or warping the fabric.  This hasn't happened yet (I haven't worn it long), but I imagine that is where the corset will eventually fall apart.  That being said, I don't anticipate it falling apart.  I'm sure it will last years with occasional use.  I was actually pleased with the quality.  I struggled with what size to order, since I am in between sizes.  I decided to go for the large, since I have a wide rib cage and corsets tend to crimp at my waist.  I had no intention to lacing it super tight, so the large was perfect.  However, if my rig cage tapered more, like many people's do, I would have been great with a medium.  My measurements are about 40-31-42\\".  I'm 5'7\\" and small D cup.  The large is a touch loose on my bust (blame the rib cage throwing off the line) but I have no intentions of going bra-less under it outside the bedroom.  I'll wear it over something else.  I'm actually really excited to wear it out.  I'm happy I got the large, but I'm sure the medium would have been fine as well.  I think it's going to look stellar!  I hope this helps someone else who is having trouble deciding on their size.  I'm happy with my purchase!
B00VY2XPR8|2|When I received it I thought it was too big for me.... however I try it on but could not get into it because the elastic at the back was to high for me so it end up bursting 😔😔
B001O5ZTPG|4|It's super thin when empty and it doesn't hold too much, but I suppose that's the point.  I managed to fit in 6 cards, including my ID, into each of the 6 pockets.  It thickens it significantly but again that's my fault for &#34;needing&#34; too many cards with a minimalist wallet.  The magnet is strong enough to hold several bills, but not strong enough to cause problems like wiping out CC info (at least it hasn't for me).  One minor issue is that the magnet portion for me isn't sewn on very well so it moves a bit.  Nothing major, just an annoyance.
B000JIH9LG|5|Great bra! Very comfortable and fit true to size!
B00FO3AQNO|2|I dont like it. Looks bigger in the picture
B00E95996I|3|Sizes run small, as in short and tight. Too short in the front&back (sides are weirdly long) to wear without something under it, sleeves are too tight to move around in much. I read up on it and just wanted to confirm some things for potential buyers: cheaply made, costume-like, unhemmed at the bottom. Chemically smell comes out with a few washes, and shrinks in the wash. I've worn it on Halloween and when I'm in a punk mood, but otherwise it collects quite a bit of dust. It was pretty cheap tho.
B0036FE6QU|5|arrived on time and was good quality.  price was fair.
B000ODT9ZK|3|I Order a large hat and I got a s/m hat it is tight.
B005NOK2F6|1|I use to wear M size (number 10), and bought this shirt in size M too. It has come out to be far too big for me, even now that I am still pregnant (almost 8 months), so I think it will become useless after I gave birth...
B0002TVWOC|1|I've been purchasing Gold Toe cotton fluffies for years; they've always been all cotton or cotton w/ nylon. This latest version; though the old ones are still available, I'll read the fine print next time; is an acrylic/nylon blend, still at the same price point of 16.00, though far thinner and since not a natural fiber is in them ,I feel they should be priced lower than the \\"cotton fluffies\\". These are getting tossed into the donation pile, tags intact. I'll be back for the real deal at a later time, as I see they're readily available on this site. Please take a hint Gold Toe and change the product's name, it's confusing. Kind Regards, M.H.
B00CI1GBGG|4|Just got it and it's very nice in look and design and quality.  It's a smooth leather which I don't prefer but it's still very nice.  I've used a small wallet for years and this is just the next size up vs a medium wallet.. so it'll be good.  I like the zipper area as it allows a back area beside just CC areas and dollar area.
B00XIX8DPU|1|This fabric has absolutely no stretch to it.<br />So if I were to zip this all up and sit down, it would tear!<br />Back it goes.
B00DTRXS9G|1|Edit 7/6/14: This thing is a piece of junk.  Its falling apart at the seams after 2 weeks.  DO NOT buy this garbage.
B005L9ZN2K|3|It was hard to find a &#34;onesie&#34; for an adult. They are very soft and comfortable. like a plush animal.
B007USGKFO|4|This wig worked pretty good for my Link costume for Halloween.  It did need a little bit of adjusting to make it look right once I had the Link hat on, but it was easy to fix and make it look good.
B00HE6EV62|5|Perfect,my ten year old daughter loves it
B000OQL8DI|5|A very good deal!
B00HH5G7KS|5|Really cute!!
B00II36OTW|5|Pretty and confortable
B007HXL9QW|5|Yes, these are pricey trunks, but if your looking to get rid of the dreaded sweaty butt syndrome, these work great. They fit perfectly and performed as described.
B0092FVMSS|4|Very comfortable and works great with sun dress or bathing suits
B0007UOLIK|5|i just got my waist nipper in the mail today and i am at work as we speak wearing it. it does what it says it does. no love handles! i'm 5'7 and 143 lbs and the medium size did the trick. i wouldn't recommend this to a short woman because i have a shorter torso and its ALMOST too long for me. but its great. if the boning in it shows through its because your shirt is WAAAAAAAY too tight for you to begin with. i wear tighter fitting shirts, and i have zero issue with this thing showing through the fabric. it doesnt roll, but i will tell you it IS slightly awkward to sit down while wearing. but i figure i'll get used to it. i had a baby back in 2009 and i deal with a little tummy flab and some serious love handles. i have never even had a flat tummy ever...even when i was 130 lbs before i had my son, so this is a treat. i seriously love it! and i have no curves to speak of ( i like to explain my curves as equal to that of a 5th grade boy haha) and this gives me just a hint of the hourglass shape. love love love! will most definitely buy more! :)
B0061Q5MIM|5|he looks like the giant pumpkin.... but he is one of the safest men on the oil rig.
B00KSF5SYU|4|looks nice - will wear it on the big day
B00FY8Y14E|5|They look so so cute on my daughter!
B01069ZBT4|1|The 3 T size was very long. We will have to get them shortened. Additionally, the belt was not included in with our pants
B00FLTF85C|5|Comfy. Cotton. Stretchy but not too stretchy. Great color.
B00NJGQERK|5|Love them very comfortable
B00DCCSHVM|5|The dress was gorgeous. I plan to use it on comicon. It fits well so all I need are the accessories.
B001PTGB2Q|4|The first thing I have to get out of the way is that this is seriously the softest shirt I've ever gotten.  It honestly doesn't make much of a difference to me since I just use these as undershirts, but I love the material.  I have gotten the underarmour shirts in the past, and that material just wicks sweat out (and onto my work shirt!) so I'm pretty much instantly drenched.<br /><br />This material is more like cotton, and seems to dry really quickly. It is snug-fitting but not tight or constricting. The under armour shirts that I have are more baggy, but again they are that moisture wicking material.<br /><br />The only reason this gets a 4 is the price.  I believe 1 shirt was $25, which is a bit steep for an undershirt. I guess you get what you pay for, though, as these are much better than the hains/jocky ones that you can buy at other store. Those ones bunch up, shrink, and don't breathe well.<br />-Pat
B0064Y454I|5|Cannot say enough good things. They've super comfortable. Warm enough for Chicago windy fall. Have worn them for everyday wear and working out. Not see through at all. Will be buying more!
B00GTYB3BG|5|Very pleased with fit, color, and especially zippers (they work!).  Always loved Columbia fleece jackets and this is my favorite so far.  The cell  phone front zip pocket is perfect for eye glasses.<br /><br />Other reviewers complained about the forearm area being tight; I have plenty of room without it being baggy.  For comparisons I am 6'-1&#34; and 185 lbs.  The jacket hangs 5&#34; past my belt and the sleeve length is perfect.  I would, and probably will, get more in other colors.
B00ANKYDOQ|4|I wanted to love this, the colors are great, but it was just too shapeless.  Also, i am 5'8&#34; and it was too long.  That never happens to me!
B00I8TVQP8|5|JUST AS U SEE IN THE PICUTER LOV IT ...
B008XDUAQA|5|awesome
B002DGHGVK|3|Just super great costume for the Halloween!! I was 7 months pregnant in last Helloween, so My friends liked very much this fat mexican guy (i put fake mustache).
B0026P4648|4|My order arrived on time. My bras fit as they were supposed to.  I am pleased with the product and the service.
B00JX575HE|1|Nice shirt but can't go by typical sizing. 1 to 2 sizes smaller than US clothing.
B001LD4WTK|5|Shipped fast and exactly what I wanted!
B00J8WD2XI|5|Got these and was concerned at first because they looked like they were a junior's size medium. Thankfully, I was wrong and when I tried them on, they fit me perfectly. I have a small waist with a big butt and a bit of hips. The rise and length are just right and they are not sheer at all. I got them in 4 colours and am looking forward to ordering more. The best part is that they are breathable cotton rather than hot, sticky nylon. Perfect for summer weather!!!
B00A65Z7CK|4|Fits as expected, nice top, doesn't suit me so I am returning it for another style. But shipping was fast and the other top I bought looked great. Fast service, good quality.
B00BBGBJ52|5|This bra is AMAZING! I am a 42D and let's just say that when the bra comes off...the breasts fall down. But this bra gives me great lift and support. Love it!!!!!
B00MGARZ1O|5|It looks really really nice. I got lots of compliments. Unfortunately the bow corners have frayed threads after just one wear. I have a few more from this brand that I haven't worn yet, so I don't know if it's a brand issue or just this particular pattern. I will update this after I wear the others.  EDIT: After wearing many many bow ties after the last six months or so, I am bumping this up to five stars. I really like this one. The wear issue is there on every single bow tie brand I've worn. The rule I'm noticing, is the more complex the pattern, the faster it wears. I'm using a pair of scissors to snip away the fuzz that forms on them.
B00N3U5WLG|4|I like the fit, and I am keeping it, but I thought it would be all lace and not so much padding.
B008FXMNT0|5|LOVE IT
B007PESS5I|4|My grandson loved his new underwear.  Max is 3 and when the item had arrived he immediately tried putting them on over his pants.  The quality could of been alittle better but I have no regrets buying them for him.  Christine
B000VWC97Y|2|This coat looks nice & is warm but has fallen apart within weeks. We ordered several of these for our business & after paying to have them embroidered they have all started falling apart. We specifically wanted Dickies because of their superior quality but these coats are terrible.
B003O9YY88|4|What a cute little outfit. Was perfect for our trip to Hawaii. Washes well and kept its vibrant colors. Perfect purchase.
B0086ZVJT2|5|These fit my 2 yr old son just right. I like the pattern and the fit. I think these will last for some time before he grows out of them.<br />I would buy another pair if needed, but obviously a bigger size as he grows.
B00M1TJS8I|5|Wore it to a Christmas in July party and got a lot of fun comments about it. Seems to be high quality. It's a fun piece of clothing.
B00CLDTMOE|4|Althought, these capri pants didn't fit and I had to return them, I recommend them to anyone that is considering buying these.<br />The material was comfortable to your skin.  The style is a slimmer cut then some other brands and it comes in several colors .  You can make these part of your spring and summer wardrobe.
B005OB0MQM|1|Instead of making matching panties for all of their bras, Le Mystere is using this &#34;Perfect Pair&#34; line to &#34;match&#34; almost all of their bras...not so much!!! The color may be the same but that's where it all ends.  Things don't match when the lace (patterns or usage), fabric type (cotton v. nylon v. satin, etc), finish (shiny vs. matte), etc do not match the bras at all!!! I found a bra I LOVE and thought I was ordering the &#34;matching&#34; panty when I clicked a &#34;complete the set&#34;...but the matte cotton finished, lace free bra in no way matched these shiny nylon panties covered in lace!  I actually thought I was sent the incorrect item because there is no way it could have matched what they claimed it did.<br /><br />To top it off, these may be THE WORLD'S FIRST GRANNY PANTY BOYSHORT!!! I don't know why exactly...fabric? lace style/placement? But they look like they could have been solid in &#34;Woolworth's&#34; next to the bullet bras!  And they leg openings where so oversized that they barely &#34;held&#34; my leg at all and thus rode up...and that was when trying them on OVER my bikini panty (for hygiene sake) so they would huge in the leg on their own.  I have other Le Mystere panties is the same size and they fit perfectly so this is a style issue...they are not just &#34;too big&#34;.<br /><br />PLEASE MAKE PANTIES THAT ACTUALLY MATCH THE BRAS!  I'm sure these match at least one of their bras, but IT IS A LIE TO TELL PEOPLE THEY ARE A PART OF A MATCHING SET WHEN THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL.
B00DQYPOZ8|3|The jacket was smaller than expected.
B008S2F3HM|5|Nice Jeans.....the right size for my husband
B003N2WRC6|5|I am very pleased with these board shorts. Great price and great looking! There's no need to pay $50+ for board shorts.
B00OJP2BNG|5|I love it; it is super soft and comfy.
B00MZ75JPC|2|So cute, until you wear them for a full day.  Then they get fat and fall down.  When you wash them, you'll have to give them to a kid.
B0007YXVRI|4|This has been my favorite bra for many years and I can no longer find this particular style from Playtex in any of our local stores!  I believe it has been discontinued, but a friend suggested I check with your web site and, sure enough, I found it.  I sure was glad I could restock my bras after a year of searching for them.
B00GBE4GH2|5|It was great!
B002UN5Z14|4|Nice length
B00NIIN06W|5|Myv item came within an couple of days and it was really great quality. Too often I've ordered things and the material is NOT what I expect it to be but this was perfect
B00S568L9S|4|Very nice and comfortable
B007GB8EYK|5|This pajama set is as cute as the picture!!!  I wouldn't hesitate to buy from this seller again in the future.  I received it very quickly.  I have no complaints at all.  Thank you!
B00K5IAEWG|4|there are very confatable, soft.<br />the colors are beautiful.
B00JS8O7I6|5|love it
B00DSYBWI4|3|I have been looking for sweaters for my husband for sometimes. But most are so similar or plain. This one caught my eyes. I loved the little dots and detailed pattern all over, plus it is 100% cotton. Delivered fast and it fits as expected. But it needs delicate care, normal machine wash and dry would shrink it.
B005O0BKFA|3|Very cute. My granddaughter loved it but hard to stay on. No clips to hold it  on a child s head.  We woked out.
B008H4JLWE|2|These arecokay but noy sized correctly, the ran at least pen stye smaller than expected must order a size larger than usual
B00KD6RIFQ|5|Luv these.
B000KGKEMS|4|Fits great, but came too late.
B0068XZ09O|4|Well made a little on the thin side.  Wear more like nylon tights than leggings.  Worked great for sweater dress for cool not cold day.
B00B804TMG|5|I love this beanie. It never balls up like some beanies and it's so soft! The fit stays true and never stretches out.
B00E0RLNRI|5|Nice quality t-shirt.  Good weight fabric and great fit.  This was a gift for my son who is a BB Theory fan and relates to Sheldon.  Launders well.  It is a winner!
B00T3CHAGS|5|A beautiful well made item!!  Highly recommended !!
B00248NW6U|5|Beyond happy with the product. Its very well made. And arrived fast than expected. Im half Irish so im excited to have someting to slap on my favorite hoodie and show off some haritage pride ^_^
B008BFJ5VQ|5|My 22 y/o daughter loves these gloves. They are warm and fit well. (Her hands are a medium/large size.) She has enjoyed wearing them.
B0057X9MJA|5|I love these shirts. I keep ordering them
B004WPHV9C|5|She loved it. Great costume. The gloves kept coming untied.
B00HUS6XV0|3|I have worn a size 7 -same mfg.--and these feel like I am wearing a &#34;girdle&#34;
B00M9NP5M4|2|This product runs small. I'm a size large in underwear and these are not ONE SIZE FITS ALL.  They are too tight in hip area. You can see the &#34;dent/line&#34; on your hips under tight dress or jeans. Won't be using them.  $35 down the drain.
B000SP6UVK|1|The gold toe brand, overall, has always impressed me. The quality is there, but they are like child size. Definitely wouldn't buy this product again.
B00EJZEL7A|3|Like the dress, is a little big though. Would work as a cover up in the summer or at the beach.
B00DTWHAG8|5|Awesome shirt. I get compliments all the time.
B00AAEZM5O|5|My son LOVES these! his 2 and is between a size 6/7 so i got the size 7/8 he had a little trouble at first but loves them!!!!!!!!! he shows everyone where spongebob and patrick are
B00JVN6Z92|4|This is a very nice item, well made. It does run a bit large, however since it drapes, I can work with it.
B0007CKJ6Q|3|I love wrangler jeans and I am built weird so I wear the men's jeans, I bought 2 pair of these. I own 3 pair just like these, same 13MWZGK number, same size, etc., the two pair I ordered from Amazon are 2.5 inches smaller in the waist than the 3 previous pair yet they are the same size and same original fit jeans.  So disappointed, now will have to drive 50 miles one way to try them on before buying.......sigh
B00GIPO20K|5|Very pleased, keeps my legs warm.
B0049HQ0L8|5|I got these because it got a little chilly (nowhere near -30 C) and they are brilliant. I can stand outside on the porch in flip flops with these on and they'll be the warmest part of me. Absolutely, deliciously, warm.
B002WUQCQW|4|I purchased the XXL, which usually fits me a bit larger then this shirt did, it still fits, but I would purchase the XXXL next time. It is a good shirt, looks great and would have gotten 5 stars if it was a slightly larger fit.
B008TN2NIC|5|brilliant fit, so soft, totally comfortable
B00UOML5FS|1|I have a bigger chest and the girls were popping out and the length was to long made me look 3 size bigger ...
B002VXC0N4|1|These were very stingy for crotch room - un-wearable for my husband, and he is normal in height and weight.  Could also use elastic waist with drawstring.
B001B4P6K8|5|It is a very good wig for what it cost. It arrived very fast. Great service! I can only say positive about this shopping experience.
B002ECZIIG|3|The pants are a little see through.<br /><br />But for what it is, a costume it works for either 70s disco or Elvis look.<br /><br />Can't beat the price
B00NWUQL30|3|I really like the front of the shirt. It is longer than i thought it would be. The material is very thin also.
B00O5EZ8QI|5|Comfortable wish they came out with these years ago!
B000T9QAF6|5|sexy!! just like VS
B000K2DF0U|5|This was for the guy in my life..hes snake crazy...singer in a band. This was the best gift..He loved it. Great material..fits fabulous..and made him grin. :)
B00KRNZPLO|5|What else is an Italian Grandfather going to wear ?
B001CW6UFO|3|I am roughly a 36c now that I am breastfeeding and this was a bit of a squeeze. It was very short and wanted to ride up my back. I've never had that happen with another bra before.
B002BTUCKG|5|To be honest, I found the hat at REI.  I went to dinner and when I came back an hour later, someone had bought the only medium they had.  I think someone saw me trying it on realized what a cool hat it is.  There's a wire in the brim that allows you to fold it and tweak it the way you want.  I would've liked a small but they don't make them so I took that cardboard in the packing and slipped it into the inside band to add some cushion so it would fit correctly.
B00AQDAMO0|5|This is a great looking dress that everyone adores when my daughter has it on.  We are very pleased with it.
B006DWABXA|4|as other reviews have said, there is a weird tuft of hair at the top of the wig and it also seems to be that way under the rest of the wig hair, but it's certainly not noticeable and i don't mind it too much. it's very soft and good quality and fits nicely.
B00A0GLAM6|5|This mask was exactly as described and shipped quickly. Airing out the mask before putting it on would be my only advise. I would recommend to others!!
B00CXV2U7K|5|ok
B00AOCX43Y|5|Just got mine today. It's a little scratchy but I'll bet it's soft after a wash. I was worried it wouldn't fit in the chest because all the models are tiny and I'm kinda big in that department. But it fits, I got it weeks early and I'm very satisfied!
B00GT08R0A|5|These are great, I'd get the smallest size because they will fit any shirt. Some of the longer ones just don't work, they stick out beyond the seem of the collar, but the small ones are guaranteed to fit nicely.
B00EWWIILA|5|I've used this product for several years. I like the high cut legs and the almost-at-waist top. I find the covered elastic more comfortable than elastic against my skin. I prefer to bleach my undies, but even with that they last a good long time.  Update: I've just ordered 9 more. I'm so glad Jockey is continuing this classic style. Women of a certain age don't want to spend our time trying new undie styles every year!
B00O9K5GR4|1|Does not run true to size too small.
B005MYE8E8|5|I am normally a woman's medium or small and ordered an extra large to be safe since it was a juniors product but could have gotten away with a smaller size.  It is fairly warm and super cute.
B00DX6IUBO|4|I was preparing for a total knee replacement in December,  and was looking for something comfortable,  wide leg, and easy to get on and off. Saw these,  and although some of the patterns seemed weird for me to wear (I'm 59), I bought one of each. Love them!!!!! They are very long, or I it could be that I'm only 5'3\\", but after hemming, the fit great. Got plenty of complements both at the hospital and physical therapy, and three months later am still wearing them.<br /><br />The only thing I would wish for is that Dangerousfx makes these in lighter colors for Spring/Summer. I know they are more a \\"goth\\" shop, but I bet they would sell out.
B000KI86Q2|3|The leotard was a bit snug throughout the bodice, and sleeves.  There was also a tear in the seam under one of the arms.  No problem because I can just sew it up, but a little disappointing since it should be better quality.  The material itself does appear to be very sturdy and durable.
B00IJZZ8LY|5|Thank you!
B00EVBUXCY|5|Awesome dress, very nice color and fabric is very soft.
B00JXEFGJY|5|Love love love love these!  Perfect fit, material is soft not scratchy....good coverage.<br />I'm a size 2 and 5 '4&#34;. There is some length left over for  a taller girl. My hips are 36 and great fit.<br /> I think a girl with 38 would be just  fine,  as long as she doesn't have big thighs &#60;-----im only guessing this leg size because like i said, they are  the perfect fit for me.  ♡♡♡♡♡<br /> By far, my favorite pair of leggings, which i predominately wear  for comfort, yet, as an artist, I can dress them up well and accessorize.<br /> ♡I ordered another pair! ♡<br />Lots of compliments from male and females, variety of ages,  liking my style.  (I was surprised that  so many People really like skulls)<br />I hope this helps your decision.
B00U7KGVD8|5|Bought this for my grandson who's not here yet not tI'll September but make and look at great
B00Q81T8KI|4|Great for the price. A little transparent with dark undershorts.
B00FZVN76I|5|These are fantastic! I'm a huge fan of the Liverpool brand and these did not disappoint! Fit as expected and super soft and comfortable! Highly recommended!
B002GYW2WM|4|I always search for these bras on-line. I don't believe they are manufactured anymore, but they are of very good quality. Great for us &#34;smaller than average&#34; girls.
B00ARY9ALY|5|WE LOVE THESE
B00OGR174Q|4|Fits a little big, bought it for my girlfriend who 5:3 and im 6:2 and i fit it just fine.
B00C9T16HQ|5|Very nice, heavy jacket. Nice and warm, and fits as expected. The quality is excellent, and it looks great. Highly recommend!
B000H58UCI|5|My daughter gets compliments everytime she wears this jacket. It runs large which is really nice b/c she's been able to use it longer.
B00D1R82Z4|4|Nice and not bad for the price.I would up a size.
B000RY61UM|5|This is a lovely rhinestone belt that adds glamor and style to any outfit. Add to any outfit to help accessorize your wear.
B00GG6A16U|5|ONE WORD........GORGEOUS
B00KRGBTRA|4|My dougther is size 8, I ask size 10 and was perfect, fit as expected
B00HY5UPJU|5|Great shorts
B00AZQG9SG|1|Im usually a 8.5 but these seem to fit too small
B00HJGM88A|5|GREAT SHIRT AND DESIGN
B008YJTADM|5|Love it.
B00FDL880K|5|OK
B00EF6LTP0|4|For this price, it is very decent quality and good style. although the fur is attached on the knitted cap, it still looks good with style. It is relatively heavier.
B00PK9O0TI|5|I loved this dress! It was better than I expected.  I'm glad i ordered a small size.  I'm 5ft, weigh 125-128 & full C cup.  I would recommend this  purchase!
B00DDVV5IY|4|I am keeping it, but if I were larger I would have to return it
B0080CACZ8|5|these are comfortable, durable, warm, and have a great tight elastic feel to them. they don't slip around at all. These are perfect for winter weather or wirking or hiking in boots. they offer a lot of cushion and good support.
B00QIU0X1C|5|This is a gorgeous dress.!
B008J8N29Q|3|These fit fine, but, I wouldn't recommend them for active wear. They are cut short and ride up in the groin area. Good for casual use.
B00CAXQYMS|5|Great!
B00PVO446G|5|Fancy britches.
B00C9O453S|5|Soft and comfortable
B00H9MBRGS|4|This tie was extraordinary for first 3 days in burning man. Everybody in festival stopped me and told me how great tie I have. but in next days, it stopped working.. i changed the batteries but  did not help...i wish it was more stable.
B00TF1U8BG|5|:-)
B003JH8TCC|5|Love it
B00JRX9FFC|1|Too small
B00SII01E6|4|I am so glad I read the reviews and ordered the next size up.  My newborn 7 lbs, fit the 6-12lb socks.  at 2 months I had to order the next size up!  But they do stay on great!
B00BIFY296|4|its very pretty dress but size 2 its little bit small for me because i wear us size s. I'm thinking- may be i will exchange the size.
B00H7HD2AO|5|Fits comfortably and looks good whether I choose to use the black buttons or the white ones.  It is exactly what is required for work as a server in an upscale restaurant.
B00D6JRLB8|5|Tremendous customer service. They helped me in a very tough spot and rushed shipping so i could wear it to my prom after another company on here failed me(Dlass: DO NOT buy from them) The fit was great and the dress is exactly like the picture. It is beautiful, well made, and comfortable! I would definitely buy from them again!
B00IG3RI5S|2|18 Months Jacket seems like it should fit 9 month old.  Very Cute and nice jacket, just runs very small
B003ICH186|5|I am a size 8 and got a large, it is still very tight when buttoned around stomach and will not button at all around ribs or breasts. But if I got any larger, the sleeves would be too long. I think it was designed not to be buttoned.<br />it is very well made, I got compliments all night at the Halloween pub crawl.
B006W1UVNW|5|I ordered this as a gift for my girlfriend. I had a good idea about her sizes and made effort to order something she would love. she said the dress was pretty but it was entirely too long and the top was too small for her &#34;up top&#34;. its not something she can wear because it doesn't fit her body modestly.  I should have maybe gotten a size larger to accommodate her female shape but she is tiny so it still would have been too long and too loose in other places.  anyway... its not the dress or the manufacturer that was the issue. the woman and the dress were not meant to be together.  I tried though.  I think from now on I will let her pick out her own clothes. I should say all is not lost because she let her best friend have it because it fit her.  the ladies are happy and I am happy they are happy. I have another gift lined up for her so she wont be without.
B00IGQ4H22|4|It's a nice jacket from any side of view. It's nicely made and of quality material, but it seems to be little smaller than expected. It look like a half size smaller. The height was right on its tag, but did not fit as expected. However all kids are different. Maybe ours was little outgrown for this company's standards. Nevertheless, the jacket is good.
B00DWVHCGO|4|My only concern was the smell of chemical dyes. I passed these on to my girlfriend, as the size 6 fit better. But I am a new Fan of Jag Jeans!
B003BWEGEK|5|MY HUSBAND LOVES THIS SWEAT SHIRT.  HE HAS BOUGHT SEVERAL AT DIFFENENT STORES BUT THIS IS THE BEST ONE HE HAS FOUND.
B00LAD6QS6|5|Great product! Nice and soft. My son loves his new &#34;jammies!&#34;
B00F4BUR3A|5|Love it, great shirt, thin material though, but good for hot places.
B00DMEVJA6|5|Lots of good colors and nice material. My granddaughters loved theirs.  They couldn't wait to put them on. I would recommend these for price, fit, and colors.
B006RPIOWI|5|I was happily surprised with the quality and the true colors shown on line. The service/delivery as prompt and the colors of the tie are perfect for my best man to wear in our wedding.
B007EKQ7T2|5|I've used 180s for a few years now - love them. Forgot one in a cab recently, prompting this buy. This one has fleece lining which is great. I recommend it!
B00KW5WCLI|5|Dress is exactly what it looks like,the seller was super fast at sending it.
B00ER09YLK|5|The colors are so bright!:)
B00B44905M|3|I was looking for a colorful tie. Unfortunately the light blue looks black. Its thin but not a bad dal for the price.
B00M1SXTUM|1|Ordered  3t set received  2t robe and 3t pajamas
B005NCARUS|4|size was great. a little bigger than i had imagine but it fit him perfectly. the product came alittle late but the shirt material was quality. great product
B006BCGQ2W|4|the pockets are located on the sides versus right in front of your stomach which is a weird location. the yellow pads on the biceps and back are sewed on and get/feel a little itchy, but fits nice. love iron man, and i'm more happy with this purchase than bummed
B007VIYVOA|5|Fit is great--no gaping at the waist. Nice &#34;give&#34; in the fabric. The Short is perfect for someone 5'4&#34;.  No hemming required!
B00G6I9U24|5|love it
B007W0WNE2|5|I like this belt, it is comfortable and durable.  Great Price, the reversible function is easy to use and sturdy
B0091XD2NO|4|They were for my grandson and he liked them...
B000P1AZ90|5|fits good, great buy
B00L8NBTR6|3|The quality is not as perfect as I expected before my decided to get it!
B00Z9RJQYK|1|its just a pixelated picture printed out on fabric
B00QH2ONR6|5|This is a really pretty sundress and fit great!
B003WYGZGO|5|Fits perfectly not too short not too long
B00DS1H1U0|5|I'm from The states and it fit perfectly, I also love the material it's so soft \(^0^)/
B004ZZ7G9O|2|It was a great idea for a costume.  But, when I received this costume it did not have the rinestones cuffs that was surpose to come with it.  I was very disappointed.  It was also a little short for my 5'9 body frame.
B00JMKMIZY|4|Its a cute shirt. Im 125 lbs and 5'4, the shirt was a little tight I should have gotten a medium.
B006WLXS1O|5|da product was shipped on time also is the product that i choose and have an excellent quality well done
B000N8X5ZG|5|Got really quick.  Fits well.
B00DBY4LAC|3|These have declined in overall quality since 2006.  Material is OK but the pressing and sewing quality are really lower in quality than they were.  If you compare them you will definitely see the decline.  I suspect it is the labor used to make them.  Dickies used to represent the best, most honest of work clothes, now not so much.
B003Y8YPWE|5|This is my first time writing a review ever, but it had to be done. I ordered this costume on sat 10/12 and it arrived today 10/16. Great quality, definitely not used, the buttons are all intact. I can see how some have said the buttons have come loose, so to be on the safe side I will reinforce them with a few extra stitches. Oh by the way, if you are top heavy you have two options: be ready to have all eyes on you or add something to the top to cover up a bit more. Fits exactly like the picture. Can you tell I've read all the reviews? I say stop second guessing yourself and just order it already. I ordered an XX-L and I'm 5'7, 42DDD and waist is 40inches. It is a bit short in the back for me, so I will add a petticoat or shorts.
B000PYJFWK|4|Good quality perfect fit !
B002SW3EVA|4|In order to get them to stay on they have to be a little tighter then I would like so they leave a bit of a mark on her forehead that goes away right after she stops wearing them.
B00BIIRINK|5|AWESOME!!!!  This robe feels like one of those really soft furry blankets.  It is really comfortable and looks incredible.  What a great buy!!!
B008V00Y8E|3|Cute swim dress but a size large is way too small for an american size 12 lady
B0083LT7W0|5|Excellent purchase for the money!
B000JJKN5Y|5|Would recommend product and usin this vendor. Great quality and delivery was fast.
B001I45XX6|4|I love these gloves.  I live in Chicago and protecting your hands is second in importance only to protecting your head/face.  These are warm, look nice, and you can easily grasp / manipulate things while wearing them.  I have had them for over a year and recently have noticed the interior lining is starting to come loose from the inside of the gloves.  Admittedly I am very hard on my gloves.  That means sometimes it can be difficult to get your fingers in if the lining is twisted or you pulled the gloves off in haste leaving the fingers partially inside out.  I have taken to pulling them off one finger at a time and that prevents the lining getting twisted.
B00DLUIVG6|5|Cannot wait to wear this one out & about on a summer night with friends at dinner or  a club.
B00EJ40760|1|I almost gave it 2 stars but the fact that this only has 1 small zip pocket on the outside and only a side zipper the opens the main compartment is really an unbelievable design flaw for this. The small zipper you see in the picture is so short, and the pocket falls along the inner bag. You can barely fit your hand in to retrieve things and have to pretty much empty it out to grab item on the lower part. No long zipper along the top to the main compartment. Really??? A circular zipper around one side unzips and you pretty much have a tube to load you stuff. You can't see what goes in first and so again have to hunt around and pull things out to locate stuff. Crazy! Total Fail.<br />Only Pro - the material is excellent, well made and looks good. What a shame about the rest. Shop around before buying this in my opinion.
B00EOM16HG|4|Very cute! I love the different colors n themes
B00QFMXXL0|5|I love it it is nice and warm it keeps my hands and head oh so warm the only thing is that I ordered it in khaki and when I got it is black (surprise!)
B00LQEK3VK|5|These pjs are wonderful.  I love them. Ordered another pair.
B002G9UEG8|5|snuggly fit and warm. Its a Carharrt and I just love it.
B00FUHWV46|2|A bit baggy on the legs, and overall very thin material. Not very flattering.
B00HPSRV20|5|i bought a ton of these for me and my daughter and these are the best bras (even compared to VS and other expensive brands) that I have ever purchased. so easy on the wallet too!!
B00DHALOC8|5|Perfecto
B00KTD9PAE|5|He likes the fit and feel, says he gets lots of compliments on it.
B000Q7EOPE|1|DON'T BUY THIS HATTT    its bunched up in a ball its not leather
B00HLRPQZO|5|Loved it. Excellent!
B002JIO2IW|1|It was completely different from the pictures I saw, the color and the leather.
B0051U18KA|4|I have bought this more than once. They are great last and hold comfort in them. Would buy this again
B00MO6W7MC|4|Was for a friend.  She loves it.
B00JSD73AU|5|Very comfortable.  I love it.
B006FYYJFW|5|I bought this to cheer my dad up in the hospital. it did the trick. would I buy it again, yes as a gift
B00HAQW0AU|5|My son is a big Dr. Who fan so these are a perfect birthday present for him.
B00F0T9Q2O|5|good
B00J2BUEKE|5|These fit perfectly and are wonderful for swimming or just playing in the sun.  I love the protection and the quality and material are great.  They are so cute.
B009GPO4C0|4|Well made, but small.  I usually take a large but even the x-large size was on the brink of being too small.  They are made of a heavier weight cotton fabric than the cheaper briefs and they ride low on the hip.  And they are less scratchy due to that the heavier cotton weave.  The only downside is that because of the heavier weight of the fabric you will perspire more in your crotch area.
B006N11AOK|5|Husband really liked it.
B009TB1HIA|5|This hat is great. It's good quality and super cute. I just bought it and cannot stop wearing it. It's also perfectly slouchy any bigger and it would dwarf my head.
B00329QP78|4|I like the style and quality of this little cap...it is a bit tighter than I hoped it would be, but it is still very cute!
B0029NZYPC|4|Comfortable work pants.
B00PCKIRJO|5|Love this scarf - really impressed with the quality given the affordable price point.
B00CMC7X4K|5|Gold toe socks are well made, comfortable and durable.<br />Bought some as Christmas gift and hubby wanted more of them.
B000FAJMCW|3|rise much too short, not comfortable for a big man, requires cold water wash and air dry, I do not recommend.
B003ID55PG|4|This was a christmas gift for my mother. She enjoyed it, and it fit and was a bit more stylish than regular head wrapping.
B000A0Y6LY|4|Cup size was too large. But otherwise it was nice.
B00BNB7KS0|4|It was a little snug and It's hard to find full cup size in colors so I love the color, price and style.
B009VOILHU|2|I ordered the Large Print Grey scarf for a Christmas present for my MIL. It is several shades of gray with white. I received the GREY scarf that is dark gray with black, red and white. It is soft, which is nice but not the item I ordered. I wanted to purchase the LPG one to match her coat. I will not be trying to reorder the correct one since Christmas is so close and can not trust them to send the one I choose. I also won't try to purchase from them in the future.
B00TZKRDJM|5|Love this skirt. At 6' tall it is just long enough, hits on the top of my feet. Was hesitant to buy online, but am glad I did.
B00ZHA2HZ4|4|love it. A tad small on the chest area. Most boobs are not that close  together
B00KWDFN5C|3|Adorable summer key hole dress. BUT it fits very snug, I wear footless tights with it & it makes a cute alfit
B00J9DJSK2|5|I absolutely love this jumpsuit. It fits perfect and is very flattering. The colors are awesome, simply beautiful. Also, it arrived sooner then I expected. Thank You!
B002AB1E70|1|when i ordered it, it says, 9-12months old, but when i received it, it was really big, two year old can actually use it..
B002NA6UTA|5|Glad it was a little big, 8 month old is in 12 month close and the costume still fit her.  My wife loved it and it was great.
B00GV2GFLE|5|this was an A+
B00N4CTCJ6|2|The coat runs very small and is too short for the person for whom I got it.  I had to order her a different kind.  I have not decided if I should try and return this one or just find someone who would be able to wear it.  The order was processed and delivered very quickly so I have no complaints about that. My &#34;star&#34; rating is just for the jacket.
B00N3RBCD6|5|Great buy soft and cuddly my granddaughter will love it.
B005IZTTC2|1|This shirt is way bigger than the size says and fits awkwardly.
B008TOSE48|5|Perfect
B0041KT4YS|4|perfect color
B00IQG87AU|5|fit well, very sexy
B007Y6P5VW|5|Beautiful. Very flattering! Perfect length. I'm quite busty, so I'll have to wear a cami under it but otherwise beautiful. I could go with or without the belt, not sure how I feel about the belt yet. Otherwise, GORGEOUS. Excellent light material. Would love the blue and green to come back. I'd deff buy more.
B002EL2Q1O|4|The Nautica Men's Desktop Valet is the perfect size to store my wallet, keys and cell phone and has a clean design as well. The Amazon description says it is made of leather but there is not one piece of leather on the entire valet.  It has a dark navy blue fabric outside with light blue stitching accents, a black fabric band running around the center of the outside and a rubber Nautica logo on the front.  The faux suede is on the inside of the valet and also on the bottom to protect the contents you store in it and the surface you place it on.  I got it for four dollars from a major retailer and would definitely recommend it at that price.
B00IQG87AU|5|Sexy and comfortable. 5'2 110 lbs- the medium is a perfect fit.  Makes the backside look bootylicious.
B00RA4B5R6|2|Material is thin and the collar is very floppy so you cannot really use a tie with it.
B00FXPSZUY|5|This was a Christmas present and my guy couldn't have happier!  Thanks Carhartt for a great sweatshirt.  Please don't ever change this!
B00DW7I1NQ|5|I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.
B0053O65TI|2|There was a time when one could depend upon a listed size, but not so today.  Even though I ordered what I thought was my size, the bras are too small.  If you order this item, it might be wise to order two sizes larger than your measured size, else you won't be able to use them.
B00LPQV6Q0|5|Love this t-shirt. It's the 2nd one I've ordered from them. They looked great and fit great!
B007PBEQYS|1|In spite of the picture and description, these jeans are butt-crack low.  Although size 4 is usually generous or even a bit large for me, these were very tight.  They also have a goofy pleated detail on the back pockets and the little right front pocket.  Ugly!  They went back and were replaced by Lee Classic Fit--perfect.  So watch out.  Not all Lee jeans styles are reliable.
B006Z8IVIO|4|Great love it.
B00H6ALWRC|5|I bought it for my girlfriend. I loved it! It is very sexy and soft.
B0011YUMG6|5|My very favorite bra! I love that the straps don't slip - a problem with other bras! Happy to be able to order this discontinued style!
B00CO1I6F4|5|I like to wear my flip-flops all the time, and in the winter, that was a bit of a problem when I had to take the dog out. These socks make it easy for me to wear my flip-flops -- and any other shoe.
B002NKMHOW|5|These are the best pair of jeans i've ever bought! They fit perfect, the material is great. It's nice and tight and they don't lose their shape like most jeans after wearing them for awhile. Love them!! Best investment ever (clothes-wise)
B007RTGIOY|5|These pajamas are true to size and they fit perfect.. They are very light and great for the summer months.
B009ET667O|5|underwear is really super soft, colors are great and they fit my tall, thin son very well.  I would buy again.
B0093KTYCI|3|it was nice and all but it didn't seem to be able to be strong enough to hold me in .
B00P0DPYLW|5|Day One was tough. I wore my trainer all day and getting it on was no cake walk but the next day was easier and the day after that even more so.  Will buy again in the next smaller size. I'm on the shorter side (5'3ish)
B004RDMYAK|4|But after looking around I see there are padded underwear available that I could wear with any shorts which for the price I paid for these would have been a much better deal
B003AU5VZQ|5|Exactly as short as I hoped they would be.  Extremely pleased.  Would purchase again.  Some guy in an old, rusty pickup catcalled me.  Teehee.
B00378WOM4|5|good
B000MFG1BK|4|The bag is just right. The size of it is great. I little disappointed on the color, thought it would be more drab then olive, but still great job well done. Thank you.
B0094VB7YY|3|Meh, i will send it to my nieces.
B003WE9AIO|1|Ordered two pair Lee jeans regular fit. Same size, brand, and style as a pair I've had for a year. The new jeans were 3 inches too long. Washed one pair to see if it would shrink to size. No luck. Lesson learned, don't buy jeans over the internet. Size description is not consistent.
B001K2JLFM|5|Perfect color to go along with my golf outfit/attire...
B00BJOGONI|5|Sent it back as it did not fit
B00D2KPHEE|4|nice - wish the straps were not quite so wide-set in back - tend to slide off shoulders
B00LGEO67M|5|I was really excited to have my granddaughter open this Christmas gift since she loves her dolls and she is a real girly girl and loves to wear new clothes.  Happily it was a big hit and she loved it. Highly recommend.  Fit was as expected.  No issues with material etc.
B00K9O52EG|5|I love it!! I had a lot of complements!
B00CIYFQ28|3|Easily detected under clothing, must try a bigger size
B0088OPES8|5|great product. worth every penny
B005DIIMW2|5|Good pants for oilwell work here in south Texas. They stand up to the rigors of the job without any issues.
B0018OI0ZO|5|Good fit, good material (dark blue rinse) and colour. True to size. I also have light stonewash, medium stonewash, dark stonewash and black. All pairs are true to size. I had several pairs of 505, all pairs varied in width and length. poor fit. Only 501 in case I am to buy a new pair in future.
B00BMUTASK|5|Good fit. Nice and warm.
B00BNH1198|5|I love DKYC, it is my first time that I bought this branch in Amazon web, and I want to buy more.
B000TGQ9KA|5|Great product
B001SN7QSM|5|Good quality and a cool T-shirt.
B00KU84MQA|5|Quality is very good
B00EIQW0SW|5|Wonderful quality swimsuit
B0055QNM7M|5|I actually bought this for my mother.  I already had one for an ankle injury and love it.  I really makes my ankle feel better.
B0037KMI2S|2|I have 4 year old girls who are big for their age.  I ordered the medium/small and they were a little big for them, but still worked fine.  They looked like they were good quality, but both of them had holes right from the beginning.  The holes didn't run as quickly as regular tights, but after 6 ballet sessions both tights have at least 3 holes in them and look like they've been through at least 50 ballet sessions.  My girls may be rough on their clothes, but for comparison we got a pair of Gymboree regular spandex style tights for Christmas and after regular every day wearing for 6 months they are still holding up with no holes!
B00KT8VBJ2|2|Bought this for my Terminator Halloween costume. It looked good but was too small for everyday use after Halloween. Was very disappointed in the sizing. Being brilliant and all, I removed the tags and threw the boxes out before trying it on. In the Sellers defense I did not contact them about this as I assumed it was my bad for removing the tags. Just be sure to get a size larger than you need! Ended up giving it to a friend that is slightly smaller than myself.
B00RZXSED0|4|I got these for my 6-month old baby and they are way too long for her at the moment. I'll have to wait until she's at least a year old, maybe older for them to fit like they are supposed to. I do like that they can accommodate her chubby legs, though. Most baby leg warmers are tight all the way through and cut off the baby's circulation but these have a lot of stretch while also staying on. They don't shrink or bleed in the wash. I don't think they are the highest quality out there in terms of fabric but they aren't crappy cheap leg warmers either. They're worth the price and I'm glad I got them.
B00H3AR4LS|4|I ordered the coat for my oldest son and it was too small. But it fit my younger son. Very nice coat!
B002C069M4|4|fits good but does not cover the back of the neck. the face mask portion is tight which makes one wonder how long it will stay attached to the hat portion.....
B00IOMTVOC|4|Cute!
B000TR0ENC|1|Way to big. Order a slowdown from their sizing chart
B00STTC4J4|5|I ordered these for my  elderly  Dad, and they are perfect for him - great fit!
B0064HB8Q8|5|Love the look and fit. They were longer than expected based on my extensive experience with Diesel jeans. So I had to get them hemmed.
B0050UYT7A|3|these glasses work well.
B000J41B0K|5|Good women's fit.  True color.  Great for performances, costumes, etc.  Shipped right away and I had them in plent of time to use.
B00A2WQR8K|5|I recently took up trying to train for a 5K, I find it easier (and less embarrassing) to do my training on trails in our area.  A few weeks in I finally purchased some real running shorts and quickly discovered that my usual routine of putting my smartphone and my keys in my sweatpants pockets wouldn't work none of the workout gear I bought HAD pockets (which totally makes sense in hindsight).  So I came to amazon to search for something small and close fitting to hold my essentials.  This belt is perfect.  When it first arrived I was worried the little pocket is tiny.  While it is tiny the fabric is really stretchy and I am able to fit my Samsung Galaxy S phone, my drivers license and my keys (a big clunky vehicle key, the fob to get in and out of work, and the actual key chain so a substantial amount key wise) into the pocket without a problem.  The pocket stretches to fit my phone perfectly and  I completely forget I am wearing it because it never moves.  The belt part itself fits me well and is very soft and stretchy.  I am a size 22/24 bottom and I have no problem wearing the belt with it only about halfway extended. I wear it just below the belt line on my pants but on top of them, my shirt covers it perfectly and it doesn't inch up as I run. It is tight enough to stay in place but not so tight that it bothers me.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase it has made running more enjoyable for me - no more getting sweaty hands as I run and gooping up my phone (that I use for the training program cues and music).  Thank you for making this in a plus size, it took away the anxiety of &#34;oh gosh am I going to order that and NOT be able to have it fit me comfortably&#34; that so often happens when you aren't a size 6.
B00GP2OIUA|5|I was in a hurry to get a few turtlenecks and found these at Amazon.  It fit very well and looked great.
B00IJIDMSM|5|Just exactly what I needed. Shipped quickly
B008Q0E8FE|5|thin and filmy - pretty - lots of fun to wear
B007NMBZHA|5|I just love it.the color is great. Very pretty and the color  Goes  with many of the shirts i have.
B000BVD1UO|5|These scarves have a nice jingle, one had a tiny run that is not visible when worn. They are a GREAT value at this price, perfect for practice or even a costume. Most coin/belly dance scarves run about thirty dollars, for comparison.
B00NB92IFM|5|Love it wear all the time
B0057HNDIW|5|These are perfect for your small newborn, it is so hard to find pants that will fit for the first month or two so my little girl wore these almost every day.
B00BBB3GIA|5|very comfortable to wear and does make you look smaller!!!
B00LIEQ1WI|1|Way to small also didn't like the material
B00EH41HH0|5|Lovely fits well
B000BXIO0Y|4|fit as expected
B006VFJP9K|5|This is a beautiful little coin pouch and very well made. I use it to carry my cash, plus I got two of the little wallets and have trashed my ugly old leather wallet--I use one them for my credit cards and various IDs. I even got a third style to hold my personal items. If I can think of other uses I'll get more of them. They're not only beautiful, they're so unique, and I get lots of compliments on them.
B00C6UA7D2|2|this costume is too delicate, it also came with a lot of glitter which kind of got all over my hardwood floors.  Its also only pretty for the extremely thin
B00Q9ZU5WS|5|Excelente!!!!
B006WHJPEW|4|Great quality, true to color and good length. I am 6'4\\" and they almost graze the knee. I use them as a hybrid hiking/swimming short. I have a 33\\" waist and got the medium, which is advertised 32\\"-35\\". It's closer to 35\\" than not. I would think if you have average size upper legs, you would want to drop down if you are in between sizes. The adjustable belt is sewn into the waist, so it cinches to one side and leaves a tail. a little annoying. but still quality shorts.
B00BSE3CU2|5|great scarf.
B0085TGRFK|5|This shirt, like all Carhartt products is well made. Very good quality heavy denim. It should really last. Assembly quality is excellent.<br />Great for those of us want to get casual as well as working folk. Good looking shirt, great for creating a &#34;look&#34;. Maybe too heavy for year round wear in the sunbelt, but I'll just roll up the sleeves.
B007VOB4KI|3|Doesn't look like the picture. We decided to wear other costumes.
B0031U0OZM|4|This belt is good,came quickly and it's made well.<br />The only problem I had was there are not enough holes for the latch other then that it's nice.
B001BPVC82|5|We tried several hats for my baby before this one. The others tended to fall off, fall into her eyes, or just not cover enough of her face. This is the first bonnet-style hat that we got, and now I understand why babies always used to have bonnets. They work. And as a added bonus, this one is super-cute and being plain white goes alright with pretty much all of her clothes. (As opposed to some other bonnets that I saw online, which seemed very cute, but had strong colors and patterns that might look silly with some outfits.)   My only wish is that they came out with a winter version of this hat. As the weather is getting colder, I think I may have to put a warm hat on underneath this sun hat in order to accomplish both objectives, and that will probably eliminate the cute factor ; -)
B00MF78G84|1|Received with some stitching coming out and the hem wasn't finished  And way too small
B0009MZVX0|5|Great fit.  I'm used to cotton socks in the cool weather.  Theses socks are keeping my toesies nine and toasty.  Will check how they hold up and buy several more pair in the near future.
B00PR9Z3AG|2|Even though I ordered an XL it looks like a 2x
B00NKX78TK|1|Way too small
B00RXJVZJQ|4|These in the store are so expensive awesome for the price. No need to spend tons of money to look like a well groomed gentleman. 😊
B002R0F79A|3|Nice piece, but Definitely too small for 3T & 4T!  Too bad. We will have to re-order in her size.
B0072D7A3I|5|Look....UP!  HI THERE!<br />It's an arctic environment but -<br />even though it is cold<br />...too dang late - say 'HI' to daddy!
B00VYXADO0|5|Love the shirt.  Had to exchange runs small and 100% cotton.
B000V3WXL0|4|Cute custom.
B00F5APXCK|2|The leg length is way too short and they taper in quite a bit.
B001BMIOJU|5|Fits great!!
B00HRCO9T2|5|Purchased this for my daughter.  Very soft and stretchy.  She is  always looking for summertime tank tops that have breathable fabric. So these work perfectly. Great colors and great fabric.
B00M7BFDUC|5|Excellent quality and helps me to remember where the money came from and where it is going.  I love it
B00JE4XNDE|5|beautiful, light, and the texture is nice
B00KXSMUUM|4|I bought this for my sister and it looks great on her and it keeps her really warm!
B00CKLI6X0|1|I ordered the XL (US 18) and it was way too small.  Not just a little.  I had my daughter try it on and she is a size 8 and it was tight on her.  Plus she said it was itchy.  I am very dissatisfied with this purchase.
B007C2PWZC|5|I LOVE these Gerber onesies.  My son always wears Gerber onesies to sleep (sometimes the short-sleeved version).  He is almost two now, and I've bought these in every size up to 24 months.  They are thin, so they make perfect undershirts, and they are soft and stretchy.  If you plan to use these to make custom shirts with paint, vinyl, appliques, etc, then I would not recommend this in that case.  They are too thin to be worn on their own or as a top layer, in my opinion.
B00GRIS5OC|5|It fit perfectly!  Not too small not too big. I am satisfied with this order. Also this navy blue matches with my other scrubs from different brands. So it is a universal navy. Great product!
B00KU267FA|3|Yes great
B009L0FHOO|5|Great Fit.  It is my new favorite
B004CUKLMQ|3|I have been wearing Land's End for years now--because their merchandise wears like iron.  This year, though, my black vest finally gave out and I was forced to buy a new one.    I love the new silhouette on this vest--much more feminine--but the pockets are pathetic.  I don't have big hands, but if I needed to put them in these pockets for warmth, I'd be frozen.  I am worried about putting ANYTHING in these pockets--change, keys, etc--as they have no depth at all.  I used to love my black down vest because I could throw in my keys, my cell phone, a tissue...and go.  Now, I'm looking at having to drag a purse around with me.  Bring real pockets back!!!
B004A7YLOA|3|a little tight for all my cards. Had to return. seemed strudy though. Worth checking out for a normal user.
B00P1PYQDQ|5|Perfect!
B0084GT5J4|5|This item is a perfect gift to a girl or boy who wants to be &#34;legaly&#34; different. Everybody will look at you but just think that you are good-looking.
B000W6XY4G|1|After two months, the &#34;pleather&#34; started to peel-off, thus leaving an ugly gray interior exposed right where the buckle goes.  I would give it a zero in quality if I could.
B0085N6T2M|4|I learned that calvin klein is larger than Levi’s,Tommy Hilfiger...S type fits me well.I can wear 2-3 shirts in it!!!
B00VTV4YC4|5|Fits as expected and true to size. Seem soft and comfy so far. Look good on my wife.
B00GP2OM42|5|great price great fit great seller!
B00F4WPUHW|5|I bought this dress for my sisters wedding and fit perfectly.  this is the first time I ordered an item of clothing  and it actually fit right and looked good.  Usually I would only buy from a brick and mortar store.  I do see myself buying dresses from this company in the future.   I did have to purchase something to go underneath it because low cut isn't my style.
B00SB5FRMW|3|Wish it was better constructed but its nice for a crochet top. The pads inside or horrible. I would never want to false advertise that much. lol. Pretty much backless so I wouldn't suggest wearing if your somewhere conservative. its cute though. The bust area is so strange, i imagine its the stitching or alignment but its nothing too noticeable. Gets dirty super fast though. Was only out for about 15mins walking and I already got something on it. Dont lean up against anything. Just stand there and look cute. lol.
B00GHH900G|5|Enjoying my jacket
B00EK94MYC|5|i love this brand of clothing it is so perfect for florida i will get a larger size next time but it fits..just not as loose as i would like but i am loosing wieght so i will be loving it more then..:)
B00CHZ7JLO|3|It was much too big and I found out my dad doesn't like red, so I returned it.
B00CHGPCP8|3|Beautiful product; problem was the jacket indeed was size 3 but the shirt and pants were size 4. Too bad we will have to save half of the outfit for a later date
B0058J5KNK|4|As we know that rayon is very delicate material and rips easily.  This dress has good material.  It is not very thin.  Considering rayon is like very soft cotton, I will be able to wear it during hot summer day.  I love rayon/viscose because it stays cooler than cotton and feels very soft.  I look for rayon every summer, and don't usually find it.  I'm so glad that there were so many dresses made of rayon this year.  One person complained that it fit like a sac.  I tried with wide black belt, and it looked really good.  I got few compliments on the dress
B004185EEE|5|Fits, good, packaged well, easy to open. I love these bras they fit like they were made especially for me.
B00JY7JG0U|5|fits good.  looks great on.
B0000C6ISY|5|Excellent for training
B00G5K8SP8|2|I ordered xl but it was like size L . The material was so bad. It was good for one time use.
B00C1E0X82|5|This bra fits true to size and is comfortable.
B005AHTJLY|5|excelente producto en muy buen estado y muy buena calidad me llego en el día acordado en perfectas condiciones ;)
B00JMBEUDQ|5|very cute
B0001YS2HI|3|Like a lot of older guys, I have no butt but do have a gut. This makes finding jeans that fit and don't droop in the seat but don't bind in the waist a real challenge. I figured that Carhartt would make jeans that fit us old guys as that's their customer base (I figured).<br /><br />Not true. The pants are very high waisted so they are meant to be pulled up over the belly button. But the legs and butt are quite baggy the minute they start to head below the equator, leaving them feeling and looking like droopy diapers. Not a good look.<br /><br />I'll try Wrangler next as Levi's ae now too low cut for my comfort.
B001ACKZK2|4|Scrubs are nice but a little larger than I had extected.  Seemed more like 2XL than a XL but overall nice qaulity scrubs for price.
B004C8V906|5|Meets expectations, good quality, Lush and absorbent, good overall rating by reviewers hence my purchase.Would recommend this product. Ideal for spa use
B00K7IQWKW|1|Shrank like hell after  washing.
B00GBLMX5C|5|Very soft. Looks exactly like the picture. Does not feel tight over ears.
B00AB7STNW|4|Not the warmest, but comfortable.  Finger tip works well for people who want easy access to their cell-phones when the weather gets cold.
B000II9R6W|5|Its unfortunate that there is no photo of the inside of this travel document holder.  If I had not seen them first hand in Chicago last month I would have been reluctant to buy in on Amazon.  I bought 14 of them for my staff which is a great fit for us because we all travel a lot.  They are light weight and very durable.  I searched and searched for a travel docuemnt holder that was NOT so man-like and finally found it. Thanks Ann Millie.  I can't wait to hand them out to our staff this holiday season with starbuck gift cards and bonus checks in them!  FYI., They have a spot for your passport, id, boarding passes and business cards.
B00OL4E926|5|I ordered this for my sister for Christmas! She LOVED it! It looked gorgeous on her!
B00CM3WR18|5|Since my cousin is a little western I wanted to get her some HORSE clothes but didn't want to get big clothes.  I was so glad when I got these and the gown is so cute...girly with pink accents, but love the sage green main color.
B005P7N64K|3|Usually 3X is big for me, but after reading reviews I thought it would be fine. It is very comfy, but not large enough in the cups. It creates bulges at the armpits. How about a 4X?
B00B0DSNLE|4|Great comfortable pants.
B00E43N4Y8|4|Grandma loved it!
B00EZPZFVU|5|My grandson loved them! He got them and opened his gift before his party and then wore them, he liked them so much!!!
B00CMKD5XU|5|Great top, I like it so much that I just ordered another one in a different color.
B00A7LO7II|4|Good experience, great items as described.
B00TQ7PH9M|5|AS ADVERTISED. FAIR SHIPPING.
B000LXQ046|5|nice
B00MWO9LFM|3|looks a little cheaply made
B005BNJ0U2|5|I bought these as a gift for my bf and they look great. They can be dressed up or down easily. He says they're comfortable and have ample room. They are a true jean fabric; not the new thin/light/flimsy feeling fabric that is common now. These are a solid pair of jeans that will last, for the price you cannot beat that.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these for those looking for an alternative to the now ruined Levis 559 jeans.
B003AJLYM6|5|For a costume, this was well designed and well built with nice details, like the embroidery on the vest. I was worried that it might be too small as I generally wear a 12 - 14, but the flared skirt makes it very flexible when it comes to size. It fit just fine and was a great costume!
B00Y3OFXGA|5|This is a nice little scarf. It has the look of a traditional bandanna, without the bulk and stiffness of a pure cotton scarf. The addition of silk makes it softer and easier to tie. I liked it. It's a great deal, especially for the price.
B00O4CTX9Y|5|Ordered a small and it fits very comfortably.  I am 5'4, 140 lbs with a muscular/athletic build.  It held up great while rolling, no pilling/loose threads.  Washes well.  Great buy, highly recommend!
B007GCOUNI|5|I like the color and design. But it's a bit too big on me. I probably should've gotted a petite size
B005IMACJO|5|Best shorts ever!
B003E8ETUM|5|Perfect was just as expected.
B00ID3RX3S|5|very good
B00EDOPGXK|5|Was a little hesitant about ordering this dress as I am petite (5 ft).  However, the dress looks great...not overpowering as originally thought.  Cute and stylish....would definitely recommend as a swimsuit cover-up or even as a summer dress with sandals.
B00EVLZYYG|5|He loves this shirt and wears it very often.
B004VQPPNG|2|Not bikinis, but granny underwear.
B00N1VDUZ2|1|It was not as big as the picture. It is a little girl size.
B00021NY1Y|5|I love my Amanda jeans.
B000PKBYS2|5|Much cuter in person than the photo and it fits well staying on my head without pins! This is also a great vender I have used many times without a single problem.
B00IKAW2KS|5|Great gift for the Les Mis fan!
B0083SWG1W|5|Exactly what I wanted. I find it hard to find 30 length jeans in store so I'm happy with it
B000JJG68W|5|I am sooo Glad I got a hold of these Carhartt Jeans -in my size- before it was tooo late . I don't know if Carhartt stopped making these or what !?!? I had a rough time finding . But all is good again !! (I just wish they were made in the USA). WHAT HAPPENED ???? ---Anyway---Great Jeans and Great A PLUS SERVICE !!! Thank You !!
B00GY70LVQ|4|Love the show, love the shirt!<br />However, it did shrink just a tad with the first wash.<br />I would not recommend putting this in the dryer; in order to prevent more shrinking. In fact, It would most likely diminish the gorgeous prints on the front and back of the shirt. So place this bad boy out and let it dry via oxygen.<br />Also I have found the shirt accessible wearing it backwards, so the large logo is centered when you wear a jacket to show off some AoT pride. There is also a welcomed lack of: &#34;omg my shirt is on backwards, it feels so uncomfortable...&#34; After you remove the tag, that is.<br />All in all, I would order again!
B00INADH68|5|it is good
B00DNSQYVK|5|love maxi skirts!, great price
B00AJ9G2QS|4|I have fibro and I have days when I can't stand to have things touching my shoulders but this islight enough it dosen't bother me to much
B00993VDPA|4|My Son absolutely loves anything related to fire trucks, fire fighters.  This was perfect for him and made him feel very much apart of a fire department.
B00AMNO5KQ|5|Beautiful dress
B002ATR4FS|5|Nice simple sweatshirt. I used it for a costume.
B003AU5VZQ|5|Great running shorts
B00UFJAU7O|4|This batghing suit fit well. i usually wear a small but i ordered a size bigger because i knew they ran big. This suit was nice and looks exactly like the triangl bathing suit. The only thing was i got the bright/light blue color, and i thought it was gonna look like the picture but it was more green.
B0072J7CXK|4|Slim cut, but it's lack of softness. Maybe it's because the material is too hard. Overall, it's ok for this price.
B00817DZQA|5|would have bought more need more colours
B009A117N4|5|The quality is obvious when you get it out of the box.  Thick leather.  The buckle release takes a little practice but is easy to use once you've used it a couple times.  I love the ratcheting mechanism.  This belt feels like it will last for years.
B0057VOVS4|5|I absolutely love it. It's very soft cotton and very comfy. True to its size and the color is adorable. Would have bought other colors as well.
B002RGYG96|4|when my wife first wore these I was like whoa whoaaa whoaaaaa......those are hot where'd you get them......oops I did buy them....very nice stockings
B0099RUB0O|5|Comfy and snuggly and awesome!!!
B004G4HXD8|5|shirt came quickly. was good fit . liked the style and cufflinks. would reccomend my friends to this particular site
B00EYN8GD2|5|Good quality and nice combination of colours and patterns. 5 * backpack! Hope that a bigger size is available for young kid!
B00C57A9IE|5|Excellent
B0007QMKM8|5|I wear this style garment consistently.  I like the fit, and it does not bind.  If you are looking for a good fitting garment try this style.
B005MDSRDW|5|Only one thing the mittens were for a 2 year old not a baby.  But we love them and he will wear them next year.
B00MRPVTO2|5|As described
B002BPUIO0|5|I got this dress to wear to a church that I visit occ. for mothers day. Got a lot of comments. Thanks
B00LJU6H6G|5|excellent product
B00ICZQKEU|4|It was very cute but a little smaller and thinner than I expected
B009ESBCM4|5|I am a bit modest and will likely not be wearing this as a dress. I bought this with full intentions of wearing it with tights/leggings. I have a tummy and this covers it perfectly.
B007C4EUOY|3|I really like these but was slightly disappointed because it almost seems like there needs to be an extra button on them. Down by the crotch it exposes skin because the buttons are to far apart. I love the fabric and the print but the lack of another button is disappointing.
B003JO2KE8|5|It's great. Definitely runs small but we figured on that when ordering (things like this always do) it was a great addition to our Sesame Street theme for Halloween. A baseball cap keeps the bill up and a long sleeve yellow tee makes it that much more big bird-ey! Soft and comfy overall a great costume
B00NG7ZNP6|3|Unfortunately does not look like the photo. There's no elastic at the top (though stretchy) and the quality of the alien heads is much worse than shown, but not noticeable unless you're focusing directly on them. The skirt material is very nice and the skirt is still cute, but it's not worth what I spent on it. Maybe worth $10 - $15.
B00719WBRS|4|Comfort, convenient pocket, good price and reasonably long life.  Have worn these shirts for past 12 years with no complaints.
B0046EN260|4|WELL MADE, GOOD PRICE, FAST SHIPPING, RUNS A BIT SMALL BUT THAT MIGHT JUST BE MY 46DD'S, ZIPS UP EASY, AND FEELS LIKE VERY EXPENSIVE LINGERIE
B004SD4BGY|5|Nice silicone skin. It fit my ipad very well and in the right places. Snug fit, no worries of it falling or slipping off. Other than that, the additional stylus is also smooth and works well with the ipad. no complaints
B007KR08AS|2|I wear a large. I ordered an XL. The shirt that arrive is *maybe* a medium, possibly a small.  Previous feedback says this shirt runs small, they weren't kidding.
B00AYYTHX8|3|V neck is too low cut. I will have to wear something under.
B005GYGGX0|2|Basic pant - thin, see-thru, pills fairly easy. Nothing to brag about - wouldn't purchase again unless they were in the 5 dollar price range.
B00N2PWEAE|1|Real product is not same as picture at all. It looks like a cheaper product than picture. Not as expected.
B00PAS9ZBW|5|I like the color and details of this shirt, also fit me really good, i'm a slim person and i hate when stuff makes me look more slim that I am, this one fits really good and i love it
B00J98II12|1|This is for small people
B009APXC10|2|The size was too small.. Would like to return for a larger size but the paper sent only gives the option to return..
B00EB4CJ28|3|Im 5'5 and 108 lbs, and when tried on it fits length wise but not very flattering to my body! Made me look like I had no waist line with a puffy stomach.
B00E62D2WG|1|The ivory is really a beige brown. Too small!
B000147IGE|1|This bra fit is very small - i wear a 36DDD so i ordered a 38B - it was still so small - i had to send it back!!!!
B00E0IH7PE|4|This was purchased as a gift and it seems to be oversized in length for a small. It may be returned if the gift recipient concurs,
B004ZGBXUQ|5|Ladies... I am a HATER of bras. I can never find one that fits me just right... but this baby is a miracle! I wear a 38C, and I purchased Size L. It slides on easy... it doesn't roll up or stretch out. It actually lifts and separates the girls. Not to be overly graphic, but if you have naturally hard or pierced nipples, they will show through. However underneath everyday clothes, you cannot see anything, unless the shirt is thin and tight fitting. The straps are comfortable and if you are wearing a tank top, it gives a layered look! Two thumbs up!! Buy this bra!!
B000YQ5YA6|5|This was pretty much what i was looking for and at ten dollars or so it was a great deal.
B007NLX2Y0|4|My daughter loves this dress! The detail can't be seen in the photo. It is very nice quality and the color is gorgeous. She is a small girl, wears a 5 in juniors and the sm/med hugs her pretty snuggly. We will wash in cold water for sure and line dry to avoid any shrinkage.
B006IVTBIW|5|Great addition to my Centurion costume in the annual church Passion play. Many comments about my \\"authentic looking\\"  helmet...also stays in place when you put it on.  Recommended !
B0030LPT20|5|Very Good
B003N18GRM|4|I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this wallet for the price.  I gave it to my husband because his wallet is always stuffed with things he doesn't really need in it.  With the zipper he can't do that.  He actually liked the idea and he liked the wallet.
B00CI0GG58|5|This is perfect on my 5 month old baby. Comfortable and looks awesome. I would recommend to anyone. Good for dinner outings.
B003JKL2BY|2|These pj's are super cute but this is the first time I've bought this brand and it definitely runs small. My son is just started wearing a 3T in basically every other brand but when he tried the top on it was a total belly shirt. So, order a size up unless your kid is very short!
B00EOI1L84|1|Way too short.<br />I was expecting the scarf to be softer, feels more like a cashmere and wool blend.<br />Disappointed.
B000P2Y39W|4|Wife says softest socks she has ever has but a little slippery on bare floors.
B001H1PYD4|5|I love these sleeping bras.  They are soft and comfortable.  To be honest, I wear them to sleep all the time; not just when I'm pregnant or nursing.  I figured as I get older, it doesn't hurt to provide some slight support for my breasts even when I go to sleep.
B0019NM2QC|1|Pants are made of material that is extremely thin (think of ribbon used to wrap around gifts) , so you have to wear regular pants under it. The elastic band on the waistline of the pant is similar to the one you find on compilmentary shower caps at hotels and the pants don't have belt loops, so you have to pin the pants and the belt to the regular pants you have to wear under these pants!!!!!
B002R0KHE0|5|I wore it everyday during the winter. I'm finishing up school for Diesel and Industrial mechanics and it still looks brand new after all winter wearing it while working on everything from a corolla to a class 8 peterbuilt semi truck.
B00PB6K09O|4|very pretty but runs small
B007MPKPHO|1|This bandeau is great, except for the fact that it slips down during the day a little, and you have to keep pulling it up. Very annoying.
B008LYF3ZY|5|I hesitated before ordering, because I read bad reviews. Still, I have ordered it because of the very low price. But now I am very happy! These jeans are really cool! Perfect fit and I really can wear it on both sides!
B009LYD5CQ|5|this is one of the cutest maternity hoodies ever! Its very soft and warm. The pink heart is really bright like a hot pink which I loved but I didn't like that the sleeves were so big on me, so I returned it and got refunded. T shirt world responded kindly and quickly to my request. I plan on purchasing from them in the future.
B00KQP957I|2|I think this would be a great sports bra for someone who can put up with wearing it. The cups are a bit large toward the top, and the underwires push in on my sternum. They nearly meet in the front so the pressure of them on the skin over the bone is really uncomfortable. Sorry I paid for this before having found one to try on first.
B00AYK9SYU|5|I love my new Paul Mccartney t-shirt ! It look great and fit perfectly. The sheeping was fast and the price good !
B0093AK9T0|5|This is the best browncoat firefly tee shirt I have ever bought. Very nice quality I highly recommend for all firefly fans.
B0048BJB5C|4|First piece of clothing I have bought for my wife in 37 years that she liked!  Would have preferred blue but the purple color is fine. Nuff said.
B0028IHG1S|5|I wore this almost everyday on my vacation over my swim suit. I could walk into restaurants and still felt pretty after being at the beach all day! It was very comfortable.
B00JELDLLQ|3|It's beautiful thu you can't  wear it alone you need to wear first a coton anderwear and then this<br />As it is not made if coton so it not healthy
B00OY8DTGG|4|Super comfortable
B00HWFCL8U|5|I wear these to bed and they are super comfy and fit perfectly. It's hard to find 100% cotton, so this was a great find.
B006UNO3DG|5|Looks like the size will be fine.  Got it for teenage grandson for Christmas.  Seems to be nice material.  It works.
B005T4TCME|4|I love this T-shirt but I guess it is designed for Detroit, or other mostly cold areas.<br /><br /> It's T-shirt you must wear in summer, right? But it's too thick. I live in Tbilisi and in summer we get 35-45 C. So you'll burn in this. I guess I have to wait for a perfect period, that won't last long.<br /><br /> If you leave in middle east or anywhere hot, have in consideration that this is a really warm T-shirt.
B0047N0D0S|5|forget the snaps coverall, this zip up coverall is very easy and accessible to change an active infant. It's our favorite hands down! it runs a bit small though, we got 6-12 month size for our 9 month old and had to exchange it for a 12-18 months.
B00A63YEPS|3|They are run a little larger than they say, but my son LOVES them & he will just have them longer now.
B000UJWRM0|5|Perfect fit and length.
B00CI99SAY|5|This is the sweater that you can wrap yourself up in, drink hot chocolate and read a book on a chilly evening.  I am thinking about buying more of the same in different colors.
B00NTMR5S6|5|very nice and cute socks
B008MPZVPE|3|Runs a little small- will not be able to place this t-shirt in the dryer but other than that seems okay
B00FIVQ34S|5|Am most pleased with dress! Color just as shown. Washed well. My granddaughter loves it. This will be a summer favorite.
B002HJ3DDI|5|These socks never fall down. My girls wear them with their school uniform. They are the only socks I will buy for school.
B00414P0WO|5|I love this house coat!  The fit and weight are just right.  I would definitely purchase again especially if the price was lowered.
B0041OLI66|5|Great price. Lots of room  for cards.  Two view widows for IDs.
B002NLZQ58|5|I bought this for a friend. She picked it out and when it got here she absolutely loved it. It fit her prefectly. It does not come with a petticoat but we had her grandma sew some lace to the bottom of it and it was great.
B00GMMPMHQ|5|I love purple and cats so this is the perfect sweatshirt! Also just because it is a mens sweatshirt doesn't mean women can't wear it. It fits me well and I recommend this for everyone who also loves purple and cats :)
B003JVK2K0|4|I nanny for a little boy who has this, and the fabric is just so thick and soft. He has several things from this company and they are all of very good quality. They wash and fit very well. Honestly though, they don't get in rotation as much as other items because they aren't as attractive. His mom really loves Baby Gap and the like, so these are a little cutesy for their taste (and mine). However, if you do like the looks, these are SO soft and cozy, well made too.
B00GXZF376|1|It was too small. It had a hole in it. Cheaply made.
B0098KW510|4|This is a great shirt for the price. The material is very soft and washes well. Size is accurate as well.
B004ECN340|4|Super cute!  The hat is way too big.  But it's still really cute.
B003CHVSKO|1|Runs EXTREMELY small!!!!
B00N38GPWS|5|A Christmas gift for mom.  She loves it, and has received a lot of compliments on it.
B00L60PHP6|1|Ordered a large because it said they ran small. Large is more like small.
B005H3BCBQ|2|This was not a new pair of socks...there were two left socks and one had a hole in it. Very disappointing
B007ZLLZW4|5|Cery good quality a lil to much elastic but nothing that's not a nip and tuck from being perfect
B00313J2P2|5|These socks are so very cool! Very tiny. I would recommend for a shower gift.  This gift was well received by the recipient .
B008ERGC4E|4|I received this item within a week of ordering it.  I thought the tank was cute.  The only thing that I didn't realize when I purchased the tank is that under the sequins the shirt is completely see through.  I am still very happy with my purchase and would get it again.
B006OTBJM4|5|I play trombone in an orchestra and get a lot of laughs from it. I love the shirt and the fit. Very comfortable.
B003XU5L3A|3|The detail on this bag is great and so is the look, only thing is...it DOES NOT fit a 15.4\\" or 15.6\\" laptop as specified. One has to move up to the larger size, and pay more money, if they have this size laptop. Buyer beware...........
B005CSNVVK|5|These are exactly as described,  Well made and comfortable.  They are thin and do not show under my clothing.  Will purchase again
B00NBQFH5I|5|Awesome awesome dress!! Fits like a glove! Fabric Was unusual in a good way my husband can't keep his hands off!!! As far as sizing goes....just make sure to use the size chart! I buy clothes all of the time on Amazon and never have issue with sizing so long as I check the charts I get what I expected. Highly recommend this dress I bought black, and worried it may be see through in some areas but it is not Seethru at all.
B001FOR2DS|5|I purchased this belt to keep my pants up...so far so good.  I also like the way it keeps my pants up.
B00KO1C94A|5|The hat is light weight, easy to fold and place in a purse or whatever for going to the beach, gardening or just relaxing. A fun wardrobe addition for casual occasions.
B008X27J0G|3|They are very cute but run small. Need to return and order bigger size.
B0084NJQZA|2|Too Small.
B00MN99JGC|5|Excellent...
B00MGSOA1Y|3|Very cool aesthetic and feel, but does not absorbent as I had hoped.
B000H4091Y|5|this is a piece to add to your Power Rangers costume, not a toy. someone who doesn't bash things with it and break it could however, enjoy playing with it<br /><br />for hours of role play fun . Mystic Force items are disappearing rapidly and this is sold out most places . I much prefer the Mystic Force Rangers series to the new car centric Overdrive.  Mystic Force was less formulaic. I think the Mystic Force costumes are much cooler. after all, a cape adds dash to any  outfit. All good heroes wear capes IMHO
B004RP26FG|5|I have been researching cold gear for my fiancee because we just moved to Ohio and we have heard it is going to be COLD here...I started with these because they were less of a monetary investment (under armor is expensive!!)....well, these are great!!  He has even started wearing them around the house at night!  I bought the women's version for myself they are lightweight while still being warm...I'm going to buy more.  He is six feet tall and around 190 lbs...I bought him the large and they fit perfect.
B001EVX9DE|2|The image implies that the clip will have a smooth leather surface.  It's not. It has more of the &#34;grainy/textured&#34; leather look.  The magnet is strong and it does what it needs to do.  I'm just not giving them more stars b/c I didn't get what the image implies.
B00V69GMN8|1|bra size is way to small
B002GHC2LK|5|My son is about 155 lbs and 6 ft 2.  If you are taller, you need to go with the longer size.  He says it is very warm and he loves the fit.  I
B008YWF85S|4|fit good soft and comfortable
B007PYJVJ0|5|I bought this initially to work out on the gym but have been using it more for school due to the large amount of space it provides.
B000HOOR58|5|Light weight and comfortable for the summer
B005HMHNXI|4|from the reviews i decided to stay with my size and buy a medium. it was too loose to be \\"cat woman\\"!! the legs, arms...everything. and here i was worried about getting a camel toe. i bought a candice belt like i sawothers do in other catsuits and that helped sexy it up a littles and tighten the looseness...but the crutch was still low and everything else big...i recommend one size smaller. hopefuly its ook to sweat in
B00UNOME0C|5|very good quality
B005GHJEYU|5|The Old Shanghai silk kimono makes for perfect gift regardless of the occasion or you can give it as a just because gift I don't know of any women who wouldn't love it.
B006TCKB6Q|5|Great quality! These shirts fit well. Are tough enough for hardworking men. Cool enough to wear all summer. Price was excellent.
B00TIZAABW|3|Cute t shirt but size large is more what I would expect in a medium.
B0065L8OWE|5|Ive told everyone about the hat and shirt, I even have a cut that they have on the show I just want my shirt back and if I ever can get a hoodie and my little daughter one to. She wears the sunglasses that I got from the show.
B003B89RNY|5|Great feel.  Light but perfectly covers rain and wind.  getting one for my daughter.  I recommend this jacket and it is very light for traveling
B00DGMAVCQ|5|I loved these pants so much, I ordered two more pair! They give a little on the waist, which is perfect for why I need them - daily comfort wear with sport coat, dress shirt and tie. Perfect addition to my wardrobe.
B001UJ5E6A|5|Good. Wish they had more pockets on front to accommodate flashlight and knife.
B00BQ9SS8U|5|Material is soft and comfortable.  The body cut is nice.  If you have an athletic build, the cut gives you a little more room on the sides.
B00FYF06JQ|5|I like the way these pants fit. I always have a hard time finding pants in XL petite in nice colors & styles for a reasonable price.
B001MLL0M8|5|Awesome sox
B0086TKYIA|5|These are expensive but far superior to anything I've tried.  We spend a lot in our underwear, so it's not a good place to cut corners.
B004CG4J3W|5|cute
B0088X6L9K|5|Bought this for my wife in Nude and Black. She loves it. She looks great without it, but wow it works. Size small worked for her as she's a size 6. She felt like there was no way she could fit into it as it's work to get on, but managed just fine and was amazed at how comfortable it was... We were both impressed as it really does an impressive job of smoothing out and holding in to a noticeable degree. As my wife put it, &#34;I love it. Its comfortable. I cannot even tell I am wearing it.&#34;
B00CSIBXTO|4|thanks a million, it was a nice gift, color and quality are good, the pattern are nice and colorful, thanks
B00II9D7ZK|3|I received these promptly, not super quickly, but it didn't take a month either. The leggings themselves are great. They are stretchy, and warm and fit perfectly for my size. They even held up great in the wash. They were a really great deal. The downsize is the horrible chemical smell that both packs I ordered wreak off. I had to wash them once, that helped slightly, I'm hoping a little febreeze and another washing will take that away. Here's hoping.
B00KDC88C2|5|very good quality, steel boned, and good for waist training. excellent for this price.
B005XAZWDM|3|Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, but is no clear with the size y big for me i think that the size was standar, but not is for people very fat, thanks
B00JW8UV3W|3|I LIKE IT
B007R6JPC4|5|best backpack I have ever owned
B00J2UP6OO|4|looks and fits great.
B004M6XUI2|5|Great Wallet - Really sturdy and lasted a long time. Plenty of places to keep things.
B006WH4RWW|4|I bought this for my daughter in law.  She's an artist so I thought the slightly different, funky style was perfect for her.  I was right and would be absolutely pleased except the lining was torn when she opened the gift.  I asked if she wanted to return it.  She opted to just fix it herself so that she could wear it to an opening the following weekend.
B00CMN5GKC|5|This is a great comfy and airy summer cardigan. It hits slightly past the hips on me, but I am short! I would certainly recommend this item.
B00461QJUO|4|this coat suits me very well -  plainly cut , beautifully lush fabric which keeps me very warm on cold days , the colour suits me perfectly - I am quite happy with this purchase.
B00FZRKD1O|5|My boyfriends a huge fred perry guy he loved it and it got here on time I love the color great gift thanks[ happy boyfriend]
B0094FTUT4|1|Don't hold their shape,...or what little shape they have. Flimsy fitting. Saggy even on chubby legs. No foot shape so they bunch up in shoes.
B000A2KCEM|3|Though inseam said 30 inch, it is actually 32 inches.  So, its kinda large and I need to take it to tailor to rip the bottom 3 inches as I needed inseam 29 inch.<br /><br />Quality of fabric is good, seems durable.  Stitching could have been better, few loose threads hanging here and there, nothing alarming though
B00HD76QWO|1|I bought these in their smallest size for my 5 year old.<br />Seriously.  I could wear them.<br />They also feel very plastic.  If they are really cotton I don't know what the devil they did to the cotton.
B00MGFBULU|4|You'll thank me later
B00K8074I8|5|It's a beautiful shirt and I'm currently wearing it 2 school but as u can tell in this picture the holes r suppose to look like a skull but u can barely make out the skull but I still love this shirt
B007SWRBVO|5|The fit is perfect.  The price was an incentive to buy. It's one of the nicest western shirts I own. I'd definitely buy more Wrangler.
B00CIOLZ28|5|If you are looking for an underwire bra that is comfortable, soft, true to size and NOT padded or shaped, this is your bra!  I will definitely be ordering more of these.
B000LITH5A|5|I only like to wear wacoal bras & don't like their t-strap styles.<br />This has made it possible to wear my tank tops with no straps showing & I find it very easy to put on & comfortable to wear.<br />I am buying my second set right now!
B00NRPBYUK|3|Definitely not fit to size. Top was way way too small and the bottom fit perfect. I'm keeping it and just Mitch matching my other tops with the bottoms
B00ISGU3PA|5|Very good quality, soft but sturdy leather, comes with gift bags and box as if it was bought directly from the versace store, better than I expected. The Lion emblem is solid and feels very sturdy, great product!
B00J2AIPVA|5|I love , love this store. Original good quality clothing. Most extensive skate products from clothing to boards. If your in the area stop by the customer service is the best!
B00QOELCV2|3|good but not great material its very thin ?
B00D6IX7VM|4|This is actually a sought collector's item I think, not only some costume from the wild.<br />Normally this can ONLY be obtained in one of their Maidcafes !<br />This branded & custom-styled costume is currently the &#34;in-use&#34; costume in the corresponding<br />Maidcafe's !<br />So it is a &#34;highly current&#34; item (seen from a collector's standpoint when interested in) and<br />super-rare outside of asia... !
B00OK19B6E|4|Buttons have already been falling off, and it shrank. Now the slit goes up to my butt.
B008G163FG|4|I like it...no issues.
B0078OQFA0|5|This Giraffe print scar is made out of beautiful light weight fabric and will be so easy to wear for both dressy occasions and casual ones.
B009Z3Y21Q|5|Perfect  fit.
B00C20E5W0|4|These jock straps are very comfortable and the material is of very good quality, given the price. Only downfall was its fit. Although I'm quite small with a 28&#34; waist, the small size still fit a bit large. The straps that fall below the bot ticks were far from snug and a bit loose. Otherwise, I'm very happy with my purchase. :)
B00EZDLMWS|3|Cute blouse, but it's open in the back and must be tied in order to be closed. I should have paid more attention to the reviews ;)
B004SWJ2E6|4|We ordered a tall because the regular XL was a bit too short after being washed and dried.
B005I68DIM|5|These were way cute with my witch Halloween costume. They arrived promptly and fit comfortably.
B00EM2RK46|5|I bought this fleece jacket during a lightning deal and I'm very satisfied with it. Its light and warm at the same time. Excellent fleece quality.
B011NEHHUC|2|Its a beautiful dress but its way too small!!!, you have to order one or two size bigger!
B00NB1LJ1Y|1|Evidently this product is not consistent as the one I received is more like a sweater vest, hitting just at the waist instead of at the knees.  I cannot achieve the look in the photo advertisement.  Yet I see that other reviewers have said that it fits as advertised or is either too big.  I'm very disappointed and am unhappy that I paid for this item that looks nothing like the photo.
B004NJF0EK|5|The fit is quite comfortable, the length is perfect even after washing, and the package arrived promptly. I am very pleased.
B00GJ6JIMK|1|These were adult socks.
B00JUM36NM|5|love it
B00NJ8DSMM|4|Great shirt, just runs big. I got medium thinking I would need to lose weight to fit into it. It was tight for the first wear, but after washing and drying it's seems to be bigger. Runs about a size big I think after washing. It does show off every flaw in ur stomach area, so not for girls with a lot of muffin. I have to suck mine in to look good in this. Wish I would have got smal though. It is kind of like a really long shirt, you rouche it urself, it's doesn't come made that way which is what I thought at first from the pics.
B005N4KUIA|1|The &#34;lace&#34; look of the dress is very nice but it's of very cheap material. Also the slip dress was poor quality and made for women with longer torsos.
B00RF6B394|4|I love my moccasins. They were comfortable right out of the box. The only thing that was concerning was the left boot had a raised area in two places and bothered my foot. I thought I was going to have to return them. After wearing them for a couple of weeks they stretched out out enough that it no longer bothered me. I wished I could wear them barefoot but I have to wear socks because of this.
B00AKJIBPM|5|Love them very roomy so I can layer it
B00AOBPCL2|5|I love my shirt it fit nice.
B00J1YT71E|3|Vest was too large across the body and too long.
B002QREFKG|5|Very nice if u have trouble with holding your pants up this is the belt for you. I see many young men who could use a good belt!
B00QG6VC5E|5|Great comfortable, straight leg.  Soft, stretchy material with good whiskering.  They look cute cuffed with ankle boots too.
B00EVOO1RO|5|Love it. Better than Spanx.
B001AW5MEQ|5|Love it!!!!
B00B2OCJR0|5|I ordered this for my Harley Quinn costume.  I cut out the center portion around the eyes. The outer shape was perfect for my Harley Quinn look and my wig hid the straps on the masque perfectly!
B006IOLNWG|1|I did not care for the material.
B00IKUQIHG|3|Back ties were messed up and they were not stitched very well but great fit
B00BZQBQ2O|5|This is great to wear with leggings or a short skirt  and tights. It covers a multitude of sins (your hips and thighs) The small was perfect. I am size 4-6 and wear this all the time. Great winter staple. It's thin cashmere so I wear a long sleeved tshirt underneath
B00D7EX2II|5|Required???  OK.  Just take a moment and try to picture a 76 yr old 245 pound white male with a foot long white beard and white hair down over his shoulders and a full chest of hair and a scar from Xyphoid to pubes...wearing this beauty.  That should give a definite rating.
B0036UTCOQ|5|I have purchased and own several 'Jaxon' hats. They are decently crafted and sewn. Very good fit and well patterned. Very comparable to several $80-$100 hats I own.
B00B9AN44E|4|I said this was somewhat small because Lee's Slender Secret line is cut a bit bigger and is what I was used to. These still fit nicely and are good for running about town in. They can also be dressed up a bit when paired with a nice top and a pair of boots/heels.
B00EOYKEEA|4|looks great.  Feels good.  very usable.
B000SOYZIQ|5|Was awesome....loved it
B00A6YDTTO|2|liked the stuff but too big and ordered smaller ones
B0059S0TQ8|4|Runs small
B00817DZ0G|3|Colors a little drab, thin but very comfy
B002MJV7K4|4|The first shirt I received was larger than expected, so I returned it and reordered a smaller size. I received another one within 2 days and it fits much better. Amazon prime did a great job with the return, replacement and payment credit.
B0018OQ93Y|5|My biggest mistake in buying Levi's since 1974 is choosing them for women. I thought back to my favorite Levi's (I was 14 years old) and they were my younger brother's that he had out-grown! Then I was on the search for a boy's (or young man's) size. I ordered a size 18 but they were a few inches too big so I tried a size 16 (28x28) and got a perfect fit!<br />The mistake that Levi's is making is there isn't a complete sizing chart online. The company should have a website that has ALL styles AND measurements. Marketing should leave \\"Women's, Men's, Boy's\\" out of their name of the jeans!!!<br />There are probably millions of women that would get a better fit if they switched to \\"Men's or Boy's\\" sizing. That's probably how the style of \\"Boyfriend\\" jeans happened.
B00JKG1PA4|5|Bello..!
B003D85BVE|4|I used the size chart and I was in between sizes or I should say I fit into two size categories. So I ordered this, the x-small and the small. Due to the nature of the costume being form fitting they do run small. The x-small was too short on my arms and legs. I am 5'9&#34; though. I kept the small and sent this one back. The material is great and super stretchy. I got tons of compliments on the costume. I also bought the wig, ear set and face makeup to go with it. Great Buy!
B00N02JR2C|5|Love this suit.  The extra loose layers hide tummy bulge.  I'm not saying I look like a skinny little thing in this but at least I'm not embarrassed to go out in public. :)
B00TXASHZI|5|Love this! It's rare that faux fur is nice enough to look as lush as real. Especially when it comes to kids clothes - most faux stuff is obvious. But with this stole,  everyone will want to touch it because they won't believe it's not real.  It has that luxurious delicate look. Also I appreciate that the ivory is not dingy or yellowish. (The gray is not as convincing or pretty but pretty good. If you get the great, definitely liven it up with a sparkly brooch.)  I really liked the starburst brooch and bought it separately at the tionbridal website- I contacted them and they shipped both my orders together for no additional cost on the brooch (they gave me a coupon code for free shipping before I ordered on their website). They also rushed the order to me because we need this for an event shortly and it arrived 2-3 days before estimate.  This stole does have a hook on the ends, which is hidden once you hook it. The brooch will be used to make it fit a bit smaller. I ordered a medium for a 4yo and  I see I probably could've ordered a small but this way we can use it for another few years.  If you are comparing styles of cover-ups as I did (for a wedding in the snow), this will be the most beautiful by far. I looked at boleros, jackets, capelets, wraps, shrugs. I found the bolero and shrugs to be too close-fitting to the body and the curved areas on the chest to just not be right for kids. Those also look so utilitarian like having no aesthetic purpose but to keep the shoulders warm or covered for modesty. On the other hand, the jackets have sleeves and even the capelets sometimes do so they're much bulkier and need to be very nice to match how nice your dress is or they'll really detract from the outfit overall. My other problem with the above is that the closures often are very low quality like the ribbon you tie to close the bolero. You spend so much on the dress and all accessories to put a cheap ribbon tied in a large now front and center.  This stole/wrap actually adds to the beauty of the dress and looks like part of the outfit, part of the presentation, not just slapped on top for utilitarian purposes.
B00T3DDHYQ|1|Probably the worst belt that I have ever bought. After using it a couple of times the buckle changed the color of the belt, It now has like white stains.
B008VS8R3K|1|: (
B006DASGIO|5|Great fit, easy care and bright trendy style. These are great socks for anyone looking for a trendier look. Love them.
B00HUS7C1A|5|Feels great
B00BGCQ22Q|5|Fits perfectly! I'm going to order more'
B00O5SI2TY|5|My girlfriend loves these socks!
B00ZFIWDBQ|3|Super cute but fits very odd.
B00CSLYVYK|1|They are wider than they looked online how do I exchange for slim types
B00IU923GC|5|Everything I expected.
B00IOZ9342|4|Nice and sturdy.
B00I4ILK0Y|1|not long at all!
B00CHGP0PA|4|My son wears a size 3 in most clothes, sometimes a size 2. He will be 3 years old in a couple of months. I have never ordered this brand before and it seems to run big. There is no way he can wear the pants yet. I should have ordered a size 2. The outfit is so cute I will save it for another year since its hard to find cute boys clothes that have are fun looking and have some color.
B007JDPQGO|5|By far the best briefs I bought in a LONG time! The elastic in the leg area is not tight yet keeps the potatoes in, they really work for men with low hangers:)
B00E0IXF4G|2|Didn't realize it's not a real sweater.  The arms were tight and the body was big. It worked though.
B008NPT0RI|5|These pj's were my grandson's favorite 4th birthday present.  He opened them up and immediately, in front of everyone, took off his tshirt and jeans and put them on.  He wore them for the rest of his party.
B00P9FC7C0|5|Loved it
B006NB8PTI|4|My 8 year old son likes these gloves and says they stay warm and waterproof. His only complaint is that they don't have the knit cuff that his previous gloves did and so snow can get in easily.  They do have a drawstring cuff, but it's tricky to pull it tight enough to seal out the snow.  Other than that, I have no complaints.
B00WREV4VQ|5|We bought pjs from Caramel Cantina and Elowel as well and these from Babyroom have stood up much better.  We love them.  They are soft, the colors don't fade and the size remains true after several washings.
B00ID4RGDO|1|These socks are not anything like the picture and are of a very inferior quality.  There are similar socks from last year that are of a much better quality and price is not consistent with the horrible quality.  The only thing correct about this item is the color.
B00GUBAAP8|4|Good for working out in
B006K9CBH0|4|I still like the hat and color. What I didn't expect was that it would fit rather loosely and require me to fold down the flaps to cover my ears. Don't know whether to call this too large or small? Maybe I have a cone head, I don't know. It was thinner than I thought, probably because I had to unfold the folds. I'm still wearing it though. Thank you!
B0007CKMLS|5|These jeans are made of a good weight fabric and fit as expected.
B00DGB8CAU|5|My son loves it.  He's 6' 220 lbs. and xl fits perfectly
B005QK29TO|5|I was a little hesitant to actually get thigh highs, but I'm so glad I got these! I'm quite a bit on the chubby side, my thickest feature probably being my legs, and CD fit me perfectly! I was worried because I was so close to the border but it worked out perfectly and they fit fine. I haven't had a chance to wear them for a lengthy amount of time yet, but when I did try them on there were no complaints. I would definitely buy these again.
B00CW9TUXA|3|Cute and comfy but they slide down your foot as you walk, bunching in your boot. So they're noce for around the house or office but I won't be using them for long walks outdoors.
B009MMPJM6|3|Ordered a medium, it was too big for my 5'8, 155 lbs son. Didn't shrink after 2 washes which would have been a good thing if this was true to size.
B0039GLRXQ|5|like these very much - very soft and comfortable
B00CAV062O|2|I have to wear another thinner pair of socks under these, ruff against skin. Kinda large in size so have to wear with shoes that are alittle larger to accommodate two pairs socks.  I wear women's 7 1/2 med wide. Truthfully I wouldn't buy these again.
B00827RPW4|5|The BEST women's underwear for use under dresses, skirts and dress pants.  Good bye panty lines and chafing thighs.
B00ANKOWKQ|4|Medium firmness. Much better than Spanx. I bought a second of the same size & color - that means I really like it. I feel comfortable in it, not squeezed. With the 2 layer torso fabric, it does breathe a little less than a single layer fabric would, but then you wouldn't get as much slimming power. Very smooth finish - great smoothing under slim-fitting knits. I'm 5'9&#34; and a size 10 - the 36C fits true to size. So many bodysuits are too short for someone with my torso length - not this one.
B002NPCJ5O|5|These undies are a little big which is great so they can shrink a little in the wash. Hopefully they will fit for a while. My daughter was pretty picky when starting to wear undies but she has no problems wearing these. They are also a good value.
B000JIKN0A|5|My wife loves it.  She was complaining of leaking at night and now this takes care of that.  She said it is very comfortable and finds her self wearing it throughout the day at times.
B0002TOSP2|4|These fit well and they last a nice amount of time. They never seem to lose their ability to stay up.
B00ONZOUTU|5|Exactly as described. It was the talk of the office Xmas party and like 3 other parties I went to. Got lots of compliments!
B00Q1EFZUE|4|Great design but I will have to return this one and order another size up.
B001CVHW20|3|Ok
B004071ZNK|5|Best jeans I ever had so comfortable
B00MO9BRAW|5|Just get a size bigger
B002G9UDY6|4|This is the best feeling beanie I own, very comfortable. On the other hand, it is not as warm as other beanies I own, and the wind cuts right through it. If the cold is tolerable and I need to hear whats going on around me, this is the hat I wear.
B00HVBAQQE|1|these items are undersized, their U.S. XL, is more like a &#34;Medium&#34;, did not fit. be careful sizing, order two sizes bigger
B00H7IA14S|5|these are comparable to the super expensive ZUTANO booties, which are $20 or so.  Ridiculous when you can buy these and they do the same thing, are cozier even and cost way less. I dont know why these arent in every kids clothing store. they shouldnt be that hard to find.
B006ZE55SW|3|im going to be honest , the quality of the product is good. outside and 2 zippers spots, one in front and one inside.  the size of bag is good for essentials.  but the color and design i requested didnt arrived i recieve another with multiple square colors including purple and pink that make look kind for a lady but anyways the product is good but be carefull to make sure recieve your design.
B000MXB3JC|5|I'll being ordering more.
B009OZKM2S|4|PANTS FIT PERFECTLY, BUT HAD TO BE RETURNED BECAUSE THEY WERE NO LONGER DESIRED OR NEEDED.
B00F4O2O92|5|really nice robe for the price...will be buying my mother in law one for christmas
B00BYOELME|5|My daughters absolutely love this shirt!!  It fits perfectly!!!  Thanks so much for shipping so quickly!!  Once my girls saw the estimated date of arrival, they were counting down the days!!!
B00SC7SVHM|5|I laugh at every silly saying on these shirts... quality shirts that dont shrink or fade!
B00MTU1U4O|5|It's held up better than I expected through multiple wash cycles. (and air drying.) Reasonably well made and keeps its shape.
B00B79I6VI|5|Fits great and is a very good looking skirt. It is very form fitting.
B00ES7FAH4|5|Great jacket
B005HFB2T6|5|The robe was everything I had hoped for, it fit well, it was very soft, comfortable, and well made. Although I have not washed it yet I don't expect any problems. The robe was heavier than I expected but I am not complaining it feels good.
B00SWEMHPM|2|The colors are very bright- it looks like a circus tent. Not like in the photo where the colors look muted, almost pastel. There is nothing muted about these colors!
B005V00DGK|1|Very weak, my daughter got holes in them the first day she put them on.
B000EVHPMQ|5|I love this robe because it is super soft. Would definitely recommend this as a gift!
B004LUNY6M|3|My son had me order this and now won't wear it because it is a flat brim.  The description when we bought it did not indicate this, we double checked after receiving it,  so that was very disappointing.
B00E8IP370|5|not too tight,<br />not too loose,<br />soft,<br />plenty of room for privates,<br />and it keeps you dry<br />the perfect underwear.
B00KJJZSE0|5|So comfy, fit perfectly. The material is light weight, so I don't get hot.
B00SKORU4C|4|Ok
B00FLZ6NTG|5|Very comfortable
B00LHMN61K|5|I'm a size 32 in the waist, they fit great.
B00LM32M8W|5|Great ty
B00YFJEM38|3|It is a nice short but the sizes are bigger than a normal shirt. Depending on the size a person wear, you should get a size to small.
B00DKX6FXU|4|I LOVE the color!!! It is a bit large, but looking at the photo it is supposed to be somewhat loose and flowing. I will keep this but I think in this style could have ordered one size smaller and it still would have been plenty big. The fabric is a bit on the thin side, but the color, as previously mentioned, is ooh la la! ( I got the teal)
B0031U0PRY|5|This is a heavy duty belt that looks great!  The belt is 1 1/2&#34; wide by 1/8&#34; thick.  It is one piece solid leather.  The buckle is 2 1/8&#34; high by 2 1/2&#34; long but looks good with the size of the belt.  Mine is stamped made in China.
B00QY2ZC1U|1|I guess I should have expected this for this price. I am a big woman but this just fell off me. I was so disappointed. ruined my Valentines day outfit.
B00BIFEVI8|2|Ordered an Large. Fits tighter than a medium shirt will and when i have my arms stretched out (not up), the shirt shows my bellybutton.<br />Once again, this is an Extra Large and it fits worse than a medium, and it hasn't even been washed yet.<br /><br />I tried putting the hood on, the shirt is too tight to have the hood on, as well, when i put the hood on, the shirt wears as if it were a tube top.<br /><br />I will be returning it.
B00MN1GTZY|4|good
B007SXF26Y|5|Bought the Medium size. It's just a bit too big for my son. He wears between an 8 &. 10. Nice materials , heavy duty zipper.
B00OM8UDVC|3|I don't love these - I may have bigger thighs than most or something, but they have a tendency to ride up.  I frequently find myself having to do the &#34;time to pull my drawers back down&#34; dance.  Wish the legs were a little longer.  I'll keep them as backup pairs in case I miss a laundry day.
B00KIGBLEA|5|Very good
B008B5ISLO|5|Great shirt.  Beautiful purple
B000GZHFNY|5|This hat allows me to stylishly cover and protect my head from the sun.  Completely satisfied with this purchase.
B00GRHHVBG|1|I order the sweater in gray and it came in Black. Two buttons were missing when I opened it. when I hand washed it, it started fraying. I will never spend money with this company again. Also I waited over 2 months to recieve a sweater that smelled like some weird chemical.
B00GY8769U|5|I LOVE my hat.  Please make more for women with larger heads with mounds of hair.  The normal size or one size fits all does not fit a person w/ a lot of hair!  Thanks!
B003HFVJSC|5|This made my sons day,  It has been perfect, washes and keeps shape and design.  Thanks    Patti
B00EEAXTLO|5|Fits snug but not too tight. Like the previous Jag jeans I purchased from Amazon, I ordered a size up. I definitely recommend these jeans.
B00B58U5SS|4|LOVE IT
B00EASWWE0|5|I took the advice on here and ordered 2 sizes bigger but I really only need one. If I lose any weight it wont fit because I cant tighten it. I wore it to work and everyone was saying how cute it was and asking about it. I would say Its adorable but if your boobs are over a C wear something underneath because if you bend over the top wants to fold.
B00ABBPUH6|5|my girls love to wear hose so this was a perfect purchase made. I would purchase again. Thank you very much
B00850T3YG|5|Amazing skirt. Many people commented on it.<br />It feels so nice. You should buy it.<br />Nothing was wrong with it!
B00JE6RZ7C|5|I love the fabric of this sleeper! Fits my 1 month old great with her cloth diaper
B00CGUO2RY|3|I purchased this for my best friends newborn.  There's no way the hat would fit her head.....it fit her 4.5 year old sisters though.  She's &#34;too cool&#34; to wear it, though.  The bottoms wouldn't fit either even over a diaper.  I waited a very long time for this to arrive and it showed up just before the baby shower several weeks later.  It's still very cute, but didn't fit and won't.
B00DB291KO|4|This is the best compliment for a bra -- to be comfortable and confident wearing it without really noticing it.
B001VFQ3CM|5|Love this hat!! Travels well and is cool & comfortable.
B007Z1M10Y|4|This tie was purchased to go with my uniform. It is called Olive green but is more green than olive. overall it works, just wish it was a closer match.
B00QSRYK5A|4|Surprised with the quality of fabric for how cheap they are. The stitching is not super great.
B00C075C1S|3|Beautiful but completely sheer. I was Hoping it would be less so but you can see everything. Great for a cover up at the but not for drinks at a local pub after. Could be worn as a tunic with a shirt under. The price is too high.
B00B93UA2K|4|It's ginormous.  I wanted a big massive watch and I got one.  Having said that, it's very handsome and keeps good time.
B00EDOMWLE|5|Grandson loves it = Big 21st Birthday<br />looks exactly as in picture
B00Q3M088S|5|I had bought the original jeans before and did not like them but these I totally love..
B00QLXMKW6|5|The only thing that would make this better was if it had a zip pocket in back as some of my other head jacket's do.  There are no packets on this one.<br /><br />I am 5'6&#34; and 112 lbs.  I carry my weight in my lower half and am usually an extra small in tops.  I have other Head jackets (in both small and extra small) and love the fit (the torso seems longer than a lot of similar jackets and the arms are long enough for me which is often a problem).  When I saw this jacket here and at such a great price I bought two one in each size and color. The Extra small fits better, the small is pretty loose through the body and hangs away from torso at the bottom but I will keep and love both.
B00E8GRAFU|4|Finished 2nd in ugly sweater contest as this looks like a 80's sweater that you might have got from a grandparent that loves polar bears.  Good quality and ordered a size up to fit well.  I will wear this again!
B00FBD2G2Q|5|great..
B00EHJMFGM|4|great for summer months.
B00075ZWUG|4|they are not perfect but they are good for the money.  they fit nicely and are pretty sturdy.  they also have good construction, overall.  my only issue has to do with softness.  the material is not the most comfortable - it's not the type of soft i'm used to.  it's not a big issue and i still wear them but i just couldn't give it 5 stars because of this.
B00CBSY2GC|5|EXCELLENT
B00P39KC74|5|Looks cute as a long blouse w/leather pants!
B00CP2MDQA|4|It fit perfect. The length is just right. Be sure to check your length when buying because they they have tall, average, and short. The material is poplin so it's definitely a late spring (with light sweater) or summer dress.
B007ILIMMC|4|Great hat at a great price,delivered on time as promised.
B004A7YLPY|4|This is a very nice wallet. Tough enough for my man. The only thing missing was a plastic folder for pictures, otherwise it's fine. Thank you.
B002AJM1RO|4|Like all the California Costumes clothing, this ran small. I typically wear a XL or 1X and this fit me pretty good. The only thing that was a problem were the arm cuffs, they were waaaay too big. I ended up re-sewing the elastic piece in them to be much smaller so they would fit. Otherwise, this was a nice costume.
B00IN90UGE|5|Very good，I like it
B0097L5KTE|4|The color of this dress was exactly has pictured. This is a nice dress for a younger women but I sent it back and went with something else.
B002YX098Y|3|in my case, stitches were not done well. overall quality was okay but not as much as expected based on the reviews.
B00B1F1XL8|4|I am 5'9&#34; and 158 lbs.  The medium size fits me perfectly.  I like the material.  It is light, very warm and you can roll it and  put it in your briefcase occupying very little space.  A good buy.  I love it.
B001JQLR9W|5|After being professionally measured and finding out that I was a 40H I thought my bra purchases were going to have to be budget breakers, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a larger bra available online for the price I'd pay for the smaller ill fitting bras. I read reviews about the underwire and was a little cautious about buying it, figuring i could just return it if i wasn't pleased I went ahead and got it, and I'm so glad I did. The underwire is a little longer than i'm used to but after the first couple of wears I don't really notice it anymore. The first day I wore it was the first day in 10 years I haven't had back pain. It's flattering, smooths the sides, and it's even a little sexy. I plan on buying many more. :)
B007RVP1WC|5|Used these on my dog as part of a costume.
B0058VUJ1Q|5|Bought this as a gift for my son.  The colors are vibrant and the fit is great.  He loves it.
B00CU5X7XK|2|I was *incredibly* disappointed by the size - this is by no means a shawl. It's hardly a scarf.<br />Also, it smells of mildew. I'm going to have to get it dry cleaned.<br />It's very pretty... I just don't know what I'm going to do with it. :/
B00CIBCJ8K|5|Pretty scarf!
B001HQL6GS|5|This is the cat's meow. This hat is spectacular, the construction, the inside leather band, the plastic covering on the inside are all well done. I took the feather off though, I personally did not care for it, but you may.The hat reminds me of Michael Corleone from the Godfather trilogy (except his was gray). My head measured 25 inches, yes I have a big head. So, according to the size cart, I ordered the XX Large size, but it is a bit big, but I can live with it. I am very happy with this product. Shipping was fast, and I received my hat as promised. Treat yourself to one, I think you will be well pleased, as I was.<br /><br />Update as of March 5, 2014--<br />This hat is awesome, It has become my everyday hat. I took the feather out, and put 2 black wide hair bands around the original bow and ribbon. Made the hat even better looking. I love it.
B00BNV1PCC|5|I ordered this already knowing what size I already was in this brand. The color looks great and the product arrive in great condition.
B0083XIFKS|5|I wear it as underwear, under scrubs, and it's perfect. I wouldn't wear it by itself, it's too tight for that. I like the long body, I don't have to worry about bending down. The sleeves are a bit too long for me, but that's not a problem, I like the neck, too, it's not too low like some others.
B00RL548JG|5|Absolutely adorable. I love it! And it was perfect for my daughter's owl  theme party.
B00DNNWN0G|5|true to size. Well done. I like this thing.
B007VU1FU6|1|These were so small I put one leg in and didn't bother trying for the second one. I am 5'4&#34; 148 pound and have a fair amount of muscle, so I am not fat or even chubby but these were way too small. And if you don't get the pattern and seams lined up along your legs the right way you end up looking ridiculous.
B00J870RUE|2|the top is too small
B004D2V9MY|2|The underwire runs wide. If you have a narrow root, this bra is not for you. Also, the straps hit wide on my shoulders which caused some gaping at the top of the cup. The wide underwire also caused the bra to dig into my armpit/tail of spence. Otherwise, the quality was very nice. The fit just didn't work for me.
B00K0DOAN0|5|sexy
B00DKSVPRG|5|The hoodie fits as expected, I am a medium male and I ordered an extra large and it fits me perfectly. The material is soft, comfortable, and thin. It did have a bit of a smell, but it came out after one wash. It looks great and is overall a comfortable, nice looking jacket.
B0080CACZ8|3|i bought timberland socks at sam's several years ago and liked them...they are heavier than these and not too tight around the ankle. These are ok but they're just socks and a little too snug for me.
B005CSNUHU|4|This is great for the price. I have owned it a couple of months, and it is holding up nicely. Fairly comfortable.
B00HZP9GNA|3|The dress does not fit like a medium.  It fits more like a small.
B00EIQTR3S|5|Great love it<br />EVERYONE now knows of my Otaku Awesomeness so this is perfect for me xP
B003A73REG|5|This was the perfect swimsuit for my 8 month old grandson. Covers well and dries very quickly, plus it is so cute. I'd recommed buying a bigger size (I bought 12 mths for my 8 mths old).
B008MZ23G4|5|This outfit is well made and super cute! My daughter is in the 25 percentile for height and weight at 3 months  and the 3-6 month size fits her well and she will be able to grow into it too. I got this on sale on Amazon for about $10 and that is a steal. i plan on ordering the 2 other Lamaze Baby outfits in the other patterns because i like this one so much.
B00M13V9H2|4|My son is 5ft. 2 inches. He is 13 and these pants fit just like he likes them. The fabric is nice and thick. Good for<br />winter.
B00BMDAYT6|3|Fits good just on the short side have to wear shorts or leggings
B00JPKA16E|5|This dress is GREAT! It fit perfect, it was very comfortable and looked fabulous!  I received a great deal of compliments at the luncheon I wore it to.
B004VOEAWA|4|My baby's a 50th percentile boy and the hat fit him perfectly as a newborn. He outgrew it by month three, so not sure why they advertise it for age three months.
B0037TKAE2|5|Authentic Tie Dye, Great Quality
B003P7FC4Y|2|The wallet is nice but the interior falls apart after a rather short time.  Had to replace it already.  I would not buy this again.
B00L5GSU1E|3|I felt sizes were misleading.
B00865EFN4|3|would order in a larger size - was tighter than i expected
B0038U1VW0|5|I got this tie for my son as a Christmas present, he loved it. The tie is very well made, looks very good on a solid color shirts and does not clash with multi colored striped one either. I love how this tie looks on my son, it creates a very sophisticated and \\"business professional\\" image and at the same time adds some interest to an outfit as it is not dull as a solid fabric tie would be.
B003TP2F3S|2|Nice
B00DUJ3MPI|5|Very comfortable n warm.
B00Q5HK0K2|4|It hasn't been field tested yet but so far so good.  The price was great and my husband likes it.
B00E1JLOYM|5|I love this!!
B0045WU8IS|1|Not like the picture. There isn't any lace. It's a hard stiff hat that barely fits my head. I have a sorta big head, so if you have a small head it should be fine.
B001Q52QZA|5|shurts are fine i like the music.
B00CAUYAKE|2|I ordered this jacket about two months ago and the picture they had then was of a slightly different style.  The color was a vivid saddle blue and it had a v seem along the back.  That was not the jacket I received.  It seems now that they have finally updated the picture because this is the one I got.  It has a straight seem along the back and isn't as fitted.  I really wished they had the actual picture of the jacket then, because I would not have bought it.  I know that they have free returns but it just seems like to much trouble.  After all I should have received the product pictured, and I caution anyone from buying clothing online.  As for this jacket, it is boxy not fitted, about 2 inches to short, and the collar is stuffy around the neck.  I ordered the small and have plenty of room in the waist, around the arms, and my shoulders.  I only say it is somewhat small because the length of the jacket needed to be longer (I am 5'6&#34; and 128lbs.).  The length of the arms was perfect though and the denim is very soft, with some stretch to it.  I really do like the fabric, and I love having a denim jacket in my wardrobe.  The color is also nice.  I will wear if I can get over the shortness of the torso. Tough I realize that some people like that look, it's simply not a comfortable style for me.
B00A9VDFYS|3|They fit great and look amazing but they feel as if they were layered with starch. Definitely like the shade of grey.
B00KH7K51K|3|This mask was very cute! I liked that it was metal and you could bend it to fit your face but the nose wouldn't bend very well. And it kept slipping down to the right and I was pulling it up all night. I would have given more stars because I loved how cute it was but the annoyance of constantly pulling it up was too much.
B003640ZOS|5|The shoulder pads are exactly what I needed.  The fit is perfect and  I appreciated the fast and good service.
B00D437G3E|5|Exellent product
B005WR4YGM|1|I thought this cincher might be worth a try and decided to look up the size and everything. I even measured to double check that I am buying the right size and all. There was a description for this product that it might be smaller than intended but the one I purchased was ridiculously small. There were already some fraying on the product when I first got it. The strings that you tie is so thin and seriously not intended to get the job done right!<br /><br />To make matters worse, the seller refused to refund because &#34;I opened the product&#34; to try (with a spaghetti tank top).<br /><br />Skip this item and go to a store to try the real thing. It is a joke and the description of the strings are terrible. Why would I want to spend more time to buy parts to replace when it already promised to do the job properly yet malfunctioned?!
B009IRPOPC|3|I like the heaviness of this top, and the material absorbs persperation very well so you do not feel wet and clamy. However, I wish it were longer in the body, maybe if I had ordered an x-large this would not be a problem? I have ordered other body building type tops and found that they usually are to big for the average gym person.
B00P4D0O90|5|My son loved this wallet
B00O4GXCSI|5|Gave as a gift  for bad hair days or running to the store.  Was greatly appreciated.  Unexpected solution and it looks really stylish like you planned it.
B006PHXUOU|5|i just got this wallet from walmart today cuz i always end up forgetting my bank card or credit cards at home or i lose them!!!!! after getting it today i am in love with it for sure so far!!!! i can fit all my cards into one slot and i also put my car insurance card in it as well since i tend to lose that as well.... i recommend that anyone that is like me with their bank cards or credit cards and keeps them in their back pocket to get this cuz it really comes in good use.... i keep it in my small hand bag i have that i now use.... didnt use it before cuz didnt have a wallet but now i use it!!!!! so yeah get ur hands on this amazing product and trust me as long as you dont over stuff it u will love it without a doubt!!!!! and that is a promise!!!!!!<br /><br />Michelle
B0056H7DDO|4|Before ordering, I heeded the other reviewers warnings and ordered a size larger. I'm 5'4\\", 130lbs (size 6), and a medium fits comfortably. The jacket is very soft, but lightweight and wouldn't suffice for weather below 30-ish degrees. My only gripe is that it is very thick with fabric in the front under the buttons (leaving the appearance of a bulge at the abdomen), and the string around the waist is a little short making it difficult to tie into a bow. It also falls a tad short above the hips, but I like my tops to be extra long.<br /><br />Edited to add: This is not fleece material as the description states. The shell is 60% cotton and 40% polyester. Someone else likened it to sweatshirt material... that's fairly accurate. I still like it.
B00IFXMKES|5|great shirt
B00C3XMHOY|5|Shorts look, fit and feel great, fabric is thick yet soft, the price is great, not much more I can ask for.  Can't really comment on how durable they are, as I just received a couple of weeks ago but so far so good...
B00E815U8Y|5|I bought these for my boyfriends costume for his play, and with all his jumping around on stage they stayed on perfectly and look really good too! They are for a very unbeatable price. Highly recommended!
B00JC4IQ9C|5|The jacket was exactly what my son was looking for.  He is very pleased with the fit.
B0014K2774|5|Great comfortable pants for lounging around. My new favorite :)
B00CH3NVEK|5|Awesome, classic button. Perfect on shirts, purses, bookbags, etc. Wearing  to MC Concert next month. Recommend as retro gear. Perfect.
B005H3GRRA|3|Ok
B00NFG4MI2|1|\\"High-quality\\" my butt, the picture looks fine, right? Pretty well constructed and fitted? Well the picture is wrong. What I received looks vaguely like the picture but doesn't fit like it, more like a bad costume that hangs awkwardly. This thing will never function as a bra since it has zero support(no elastic or anything), the pads that are sewn in are too small for the \\"bra\\" and wrinkled into weird shapes. The cut of the fabric is wonky, the bottom looks like it was being twisted while sewn on, and there are threads sticking out everywhere. Also the dark purple is actually pastel purple. This thing is a joke, it looks awful, it's unwearable and unfix-able but I've noticed the price has doubled since I bought it! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS
B00AHOQ648|2|So bummed! I loved these because they are light and they look very cute on. Unfortunately the zipper on one of them broke shortly after my kid started wearing them. The return was very easy and the other Gerber jammies I have bought (with snaps) have been great.
B00NBMDJ6G|5|Great deal! Get a necklace, bracelet, and headband. Great for girls who love frozen. My niece's eyes light up when she saw this
B00RKXT98Y|4|Very nice outfit 😀. I am very please with it. It fits my 8 mos old nicely. The reason for 4 stars it's because the top is a little rough. I guess the material to blame.
B00FGCU5NE|4|Haven't used these yet, but they seem to be sturdy.
B007M64V0U|3|It is one size - whatever that size is.  The is no head band inside.  It doesn't fit me.  No way to tell what size it is.  I'm sending it back.
B000GTR5JO|5|Didn't have to spend all day running from store to store looking for a hard to find size.
B00IQZIS3W|1|I thought this wallet was really pretty, unfortunately the glue from the UPC sticker on the back would not come off completely. Got as much as I could, put the wallet in warm soapy water for about 5 minutes and still could not get all the glue off.  I did not want to use goo gone, was afraid it would remove the color.  I have not used the wallet yet because it too sticky.
B00362MN72|4|fun, useful and durable
B001O9BEK6|5|Best fitting underware I have used.  No sag.  My girlfriend likes the black color.  Recommend them for all the good reasons.
B00ACIGRPM|5|These are a bit revamped (the waistband) from the last time we bought him these Hanes underwear, but he loves them, and glad they still make this kind without the seaming in the front.
B000FGZ0PE|5|My 3 year old son picked this hat out and loves it! I love it because it's easy to spot in a sea of blue hats and it really protects his head. He loves the color and is always happy to wear it. The best part is it fits his head comfortably with a little room to grow. He has a large head so I would say this hat is perfect for an average 4 or 5 year old. .
B00XGHBVAM|5|Great
B000FGVWPG|4|Nice fit
B00DMEVIHU|5|These turtleneck are perfect. Wash well great colors
B00LMORYLG|4|Very cute, nicely made of T-shirt type fabric which is great for spring or summer. However; I am an athletic plus size, and this bolero fits, but is quite tight around the bust and doesn't stay in place. While wearing, it quickly slides off the bust line to the sides, which looks a bit frumpy. I do like it, and if there were another size up, I would purchase that size.
B00E4I4XV6|5|Super comfy!
B00LAGTYZU|1|They are much more blue than the pic and worst of all the didn't come with rhinestones! The designs are sewn into the fabric. Returned instantly. BEWARE!!
B001QD1F0Y|5|I needed to have a &#34;formal&#34; dress for a dinner, and I chose this route, which went over VERY well, thank you!  Wore a derby with it and it was great!
B009QSYIDC|4|I got 2T for my 19mos daughter. It's just right. Good thing there are two rows of snap button, so she's on the looser row. If in doubt, I recommend getting a larger size. The snap on the bottom is so convenient for diaper changing. I recommend it!
B00IVEE1SO|4|sizing is a little small if you don't mind it a little tight it will work  graphics are very nice
B00DJMD15M|5|Great!
B00JZP1BLS|5|Was looking for a good cotton canvas shell coat that would provide some warmth without a lot of bulk.  This jacket met my needs.  The stitching is done well without thread hanging anywhere.  The snap close buttons snap and stay snapped.  I expect zipper will be ok also.  For me, additional layering is required for real cold weather even though the jacket is fleece lined. Last but not least, you can't beat the price.
B005I348YS|1|Gloves didn't hold together very long.
B007RNDSNE|5|Love the bright color!  Easy to read and just so much fun!  The fabric is great also and it looks good after being laundered.
B00KHH923W|5|Nice!
B00XNYI584|5|I bought this as a gift so I can't speak to how it fits. The design is good, shirt is mediocre quality but certainly not crappy. Fun tee!! It was a hit!
B00VBDTHDQ|3|IT FITTED LIKE A SHIRT ! ITS A REALLY NICE MATERIAL
B008G6M8EQ|5|Exactly as described and fast shipping
B0053XF84M|2|Really tight. I know it's supposed to be, in order to hold everything in, but it was uncomfortably tight around the banded tummy area. I ordered in the size I normally wear in underwear and I have a fairly small waistline to start with. Went back.
B001UIAARE|3|Fit the waist but the lenght was larger than expected
B006BQWGX6|4|It's cute - girls love it. Wears out kind of quickly.
B0018OY5RQ|5|Perfect fit! And delivered as stated.
B00FBD2G0I|1|I have to say i got disappointed when this socks arrived. They are too small. Description is definitely misleading. I ordered the largest size for my husband but it seems like it was medium although it was labeled as large.<br />Not going to recommend it.
B00IN6PZGC|1|I bought 2 sets on 7 couples. in a waist perfectly coincide with the size, but here the back simply huge. these pants it is visible not for men
B00COKXIYO|5|Absolutely precious - exactly what I wanted!
B008QWSJWU|5|Good quality at an affordable price.<br /><br />My body well suited to warmer clothes.<br />I chose the Navy, and color is beautiful.<br /><br />Neckline velvet If it would have been better.
B00021NY1E|4|Very Comfortable fit.
B00NE2P41Q|3|Very cute and soft just was small I got two sizes up from what I normally am and it was still tight.
B00QGRFZ4C|1|Poorly sized.  Entirely too small.
B00PQC342S|5|These are really nice.  The color is the same.  They was up good.  However the only thing I can tell you to watch is the length.  I am 5'1&#34; and the length was good for me.  So all you taller girls these will probably be too short.  Little flare to the leg.  Fits as expected.  Very nice for just running to the store or a casual evening.
B00J7BHTSE|5|This is a beautiful suit! I got an XL because i am curvy and it fit perfectly. i got the orange and the color is fabulous and almost neon. Love it! Would reccomend to every girl who is thick and looking for something conservative but sexy.
B004GHMN94|5|AWESOME BLANKET - I love all Little Me blankets.  They are so SOFT and my Prince love to sleep on them and lay on them to play it was worth every penny and the price at AMAZON was the best.  Thank you Little Me and thank you AMAZON.
B00V0RKVHE|5|Love this shirt! Arrived on time and fits great. I am 5'4, about 120lbs, and I ordered a small. It is very thin, I would recommend an under shirt. Does roll a little at the bottom.
B0045AO92G|5|Good enough, well fit
B0099ZPZA2|2|Actually it is a very nice jacket, but &#34;runs small&#34; doesn't even begin to cover it.  Saying it &#34;runs small&#34; is very generous.  How about &#34;runs at least two sizes smaller than you expect.&#34;
B00BL01CZA|3|Nice modernist, artsy concept and looks good on the tall and slim model, however, not right for my body type (5'2, curvy). The fabric is thicker and more suitable for fall or spring. The fabric is also stiffer and not stretchy.
B00MY6AGZC|5|Excellent
B0016157EQ|4|I got this for my fiance for Christmas he seems to like it, (I have not heard a complaint). It is a great price and quality seems to be good
B009R1CAAQ|1|Rockabilia shows an image for the back of the shirt, that says Bay Area that way, however the shirt did not actually come with this image in the back. It is false advertisement. Do not buy from Rockabilia! They are untrustworthy.
B00LMSE4ZQ|5|It is great! I get alot of great compliments on the tie.
B00F928WZE|5|So warm and comfortable.  Can be worn for sleep or even as leggings with boots.
B00QNVFAHS|1|I ORDERED A XL AND MY SON IS ONLY 11 YEARS OLD, THE SHIRT WAS TO SMALL, I AM NOT HAPPY BECAUSE I BOUGHT HIM 2 SHIRTS.
B001UIX5YE|5|I have been searching for years for a comfortable bra and I've found it! This is hands down the most comfortable bra I've ever worn. I came back to order more and now it looks like they are discontinued! Boo! Definitely will buy more if I find any.
