B001R8ZSZG|3|Good size for my car but doesn't hold up well. It's been about 2 years now and half of it is cracked and peeling off. For short term this is a good decal but it doesn't last.
B009YR00MI|5|we have used this several months now and it's a great little power pack. we have a solar panel to charge it, if we need to, and that works when the electricity is out.  we take it in the car on vacation as it can jump a car up to four times, it can charge cell phones and you can plug in stuff that you don't have a cigarette lighter adapter for
B0009H5270|4|very good, slightly difficult to install
B008MNG40C|4|Good quality leather fit and finish. Belt Hook clips have sharp edges . Need improvement for easy tie and release mechanism. Received in good condition .Packing satisfactory.Before time delivered.
B008XMBDX0|5|Exactly what I expected.
B00KGGTF9U|5|This is a really well made sunshade.  It expands to fit my windshield in an excellent manner.  It does a very good job of keeping the interior of my car cool on extremely hot days!  I have a suggestion for the development team, however.  Why deliver the product in its own storage sleeve when it is almost impossible for the the poor product owner to get the sunshade back in the sleeve when its use is over?  It is too frustrating to even try to put the sunshade back in the storage sleeve.  I would rather have you slightly lower the product cost than to ship the sunshade in a useless storage sleeve.  Thanks and keep up the good work.<br /><br />Delighted Customer,<br />Dennis
B00SKGHL6W|5|Beautiful. Easy to install, shipped quickly. I'm very happy overall but have seen similar styles on ebay for $279.. I think I over paid
B00BAZBUQ2|5|Good Deal.
B006QH561E|5|these batteries are great. i have used them for years. but it took 3 weeks to get mine. and i am a prime member.
B0049LSFO4|1|Item shipped without any protection. Sides are flimsy and once damaged, it will not hold its shape. This means it does not provide coverage and is useless. Not worth any amount of money.
B004TRKBOK|3|Seems a little light weight. Hope we never have to use them. Hope if we do they work.
B00A21KGNI|5|These are awesome pipes! Got these so I could be heard (Pipes save lives). I actually wish they where a bit louder. But I think that's just me. The overal look is very well put together. Warning all pipes get hot. But these you can really tell that the heat Sheild seems to get hotter than the stock exhaust. My thoughts are to just wear pants when you ride. Other than that, these pipes are a great buy!
B000CB7DNO|5|Great Product
B000JFL8SO|4|This product work well on a 1988 firebird GTA, I could not have done the job without it
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Big enough for two adults to lounge comfortably on. This mat is easy to fold back up when you are done for easy storage!
B00TXI0JT2|5|Hello. Great product. I have a 2014 Chevy Malibu. On the right side of the car, it has a bad blind spot. The small spot mirror works perfect for the size of the side mirror.  Now I can see anything on my right side of the car. Problem fixed!! Also what's nice about the size of the spot mirror is that its not to big for the side mirror and looks great.  Thanks. P.s get one if you the a 2014 or 2015 Malibu before you have a accident..
B00JGJH8QU|5|Worked as advertised
B000GTOSTE|5|Seems solid & sturdy enough. Was able to use it successfully many times over a 2 week camping trip to charge a schumacher XP2260 power pack via my car.
B00GBQYFVC|5|Just what I needed and saved a lot of money compared to the dealer.
B00548MICQ|5|Awesome

B000IZ2Y1A|5|Easy to install and works very well!
B00K474YGK|5|Excellent
B00LUPMBQA|2|It's a great size and a vibrant color coming out of the package, but once you wash it, it fades badly.  Now it is puke yellow.
B000BRCTIS|5|My second Full Tilt cover. Best product and great service. Would and have recommended Extang covers!
B00VSZ5YGG|3|Not to bad of a deal, Batteries  are hard to install but once in product works great, plastic could be a little thicker. Product worked as advertised.
B00MGI585G|4|Love them, although I'm pretty much a Medium in everything, I should have gotten a Large.... so if you are in between or not sure, get a Large.
B000GZPH1G|5|Works great!
B00V6XQTVY|5|Like it Works well
B002LEK7NI|1|fell apart looks terrible
B00192KY22|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B007AHH7FM|5|What a huge difference  in night riding. Definitely worth every penny!!! Would highly recommend this product  to anyone.
B00UPAQ40U|5|I got this for my daughter's first ar....she loves it so does all of her friends!!!!
B00009PGNS|4|Loved it!  I have celiac disease and needed a small fridge to put my food in on a 4 day road trip.  Fit perfectly in our small SUV and kept food cold even when we stopped for an hour or two and it was off with our engine.  We even bought a second for the back of our car.  Must buy the multi purpose adaptor separately.  Then you don't have to transfer out the food every time you stop for the night.
B00UNOJAGS|5|Worked great, fast shipping.
B00AQZBFJ4|5|Fits my 2007 Ford F250 6.0L Diesel. Cleared all my glow plug errors and the engine light.
B000C847OU|5|Worked perfectly despite being rather thin. Thermostat in nice and tight.
B00170L470|1|This item pictured is a DRIVERITE belt and NOT a Dayco Belt as titled.
B00HZGYQ6G|5|GOOD
B00NPQUYM0|4|Used these as docking lights on a pontoon boat and they worked great. They are not SUPER bright but they do the trick. I used 4 of them. And that seems to be the right amount of light.
B004981ZDU|5|Never can have enough of these when you tinker with your intake manifold (or under it).<br /><br />Used on a 2006 Chrysler 300 3.5l v6
B00CYLESV0|5|very pretty
B00H1NI8GC|5|Very handy, fits great in my trunk and organizes everything well. Don't use to carry items in though, it's not sturdy enough for that.
B0046IX3O2|5|It fit perfect! Love it!
B000CMHVH6|5|worked on my 99 Silverado with the 47284 brake controller...everything just plugs in...simple install
B006WQTWZA|5|great item
B00INZ65B2|5|This things works great!
B0087NB088|5|Been running this unit on my Arai helmet for many months now.  It has been paired to multiple Android phones and currently to a Note 4.  It works perfect, sounds good and the manufacture keeps current with firmware updates for it.
B00GOO3V3Y|1|This was the wrong product for my vehicle.  I needed a heated mirror.  This product did not stick to the base and the first time I closed the door it fell out and smashed on the garage floor.
B00T0XEGKS|2|very difficult to put on yourself
B001OMVCN2|3|Love the convenience of this kit and being able to add air to my bags without stopping at a gas station.  However I have to say that the range of the controller needs to be improved. Most of the time it will not even work from inside the cab of the truck.
B0076I4MIA|5|very Impressed with quality of part , Great price
B00HS0HDPA|5|Very good
B003BZXDN2|5|Great.  Used it to make 8th spot in 7 passenger van for a trip and saved cost of extra rental car.
B00D38PFGU|5|Perfect
B00N2D206E|5|Taught my girlfriend how to drive & there is a noticeable reduction in aggression from other drivers when she is going too slow & makes....questionable decisions? I put them on each side & on the back.
B002ZULKIO|4|The set is awesome!!! The seat covers are a little big, but I have a tiny Miata, so I wasn't surprised. The color does bleed, if they get wet. :(
B001O7PNNM|5|Works very nicely as a light- med light polish, leaving a bright smooth finish.<br />Easy to use.
B009FOG4ZW|5|worked great
B007IPKTNS|5|worked perfectly.
B00CPGQ1GO|1|Don't waste your money as you have to glue it to the stand!!!
B00RVECNMQ|5|Item was as described. Thank you.
B000MT7OSK|3|a bit tight, but small and I like it that way, plus it does fit over my eyeglasses, which are very small wire-rimmed frames.
B007WKEMPA|5|Excellent product and great seller to work with!
B0012ZEZ8A|3|The Meguiar's wash mitt is complete garbage.  I used it 3 times and it has already ripped on the seam.  The other products seem fine but I have not tried them all.  Due to the terrible quality of the wash mitt, I am going with 3 stars for now.
B00FSKSGR6|1|Smells really bad, I washed febreezed...can't get the odor out...still sitting on my deck to air it out
B004PXWKLA|5|Very good looking, standar installation No tools required.
B00HW8XSL6|5|The boot covers are made very well. I had to return them because they were too large. I'm a women's size 7.
B00E1L72RS|3|The suction cups are cheap and easily lost, but the shades work well.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|it is as expected,  but it does not fit my 2007 crv, had to improvise,
B00E9FSMFW|5|Works great and is much better than the factory antenna in apperance.
B000C7S062|5|great
B006RQ44BM|1|The reason I give this a big fat 0 is because of the customer service, after spending over $300 on this I was having a problem with it on my 2009 F150 I contacted customer service asking simple question and the reply I received was just flat out RUDE ! I felt like I was being ridiculed for asking about a problem I was having loading their software, look there are plenty of other programmers out there, I decided to send it back I will buy a BullyDog or something, anything, but I'll be damned if I am going to be treated badly for asking about a product I just laid good money out for.
B00KTHZ2EI|5|after programming it works perfectly
B0002NILRE|5|My husband loves it. Makes driving easier!
B0090DXBEK|5|Had the keys cut at a locksmith and was able to program them myself. This is the link I used for instructions on how to program it: http://www.toyota-4runner.org/4th-gen-t4rs/99215-how-make-spare-chipped-keys.html  I DID have a master key to cut from!!!
B008KM81E2|5|Seriously, this wax can't be beat!! Goes on easy comes off easy. Last up to 9 months.
B00IFP47II|5|To small need returned
B00BEDNXTW|3|The only problem I found, was that there is nothing to keep the carbon in the filter. So when you first start to use the filter you will have carbon particals clogging up your sink and shower heads for a few days.  But the water looks good.
B00C9D5X5S|5|Worked great.
B00OVVEMW6|1|rips really easily. doesn't fit tight to the car.. waste
B001KSG3PW|5|fits great in a Nissan Altima 2005... easy to install
B00CPE040U|5|I love it

B00YF4KSTA|1|no it was defective and im still trying to return it...they closed the retutn ....wtf????
B00F4MQJ5O|5|Looks and works great. Good seller!
B003YLVC7M|5|I use this stuff in my 2003 Saab 9-5 Linear, which has 150k miles.  My vehicle came from the factory with the orange Dex-Cool that Saab used for many years.  Earlier this year I felt it was time to do an intervention for the cooling system, because I like to replace parts before they fail.  First I disconnected the lower radiator hose and flushed the cooling system very thoroughly with a garden hose.  Then I flushed again with a couple gallons of distilled water, making sure the heater was on and the thermostat was open.  I did something else for an hour to let it cool off, and then I replaced the thermostat, temperature sender, the heater bypass valve (those things have a tendency to fail catastrophically), and all of the radiator/heater hoses.  I removed the coolant reservoir, soaked/scrubbed the inside with hot vinegar, flushed with water and replaced.  After all of that, one gallon of Pentofrost ++ was just enough to give me a 50/50 mixture in the cooling system.  Now I feel confident that my cooling system will be in tip-top shape for several years.
B008A3SOC0|4|Looks exactly like the pic...the fade is great. The corners are a little sharp & should be rounded a bit for safety. I was a little disappointed in the fact it is made of aluminum, instead of steel. I may have overlooked that fact.
B00NF1PXYO|3|Bought the cable, but it didn't fix the issue we were experiencing on my mom's trailblazer. When slowing down, one of the front wheels would stop reading the speed correctly and cause the ABS to engage. Even after replacing the cable twice, same wheel had the same issue. After some research we found that, at least with GM vehicles, the sensor and the hub really need to match in order to work properly. I had to replace the entire hub assembly in order to correct the issue.
B00CFALFXY|5|fantastic! works as adv. and arrived on time and well packed.
B00KTI7DZS|5|Easy to program and work well.
B008ADTRBM|5|They were right on the spot!<br />They fit perfectly  & they arrived just in time for the car show!<br />I can never go wrong using Amazon!
B0010B00IA|1|Horrible experience did not work at all wanted to return it and we needed it for a trip where we would be gone and we were not able to get it back within the time so we were out money.. Basically we got screwed!
B00KTHZJ1O|4|These work for 2006 Jeep Cherokee.  Purchased two to replace malfunctioning original key fobs and now have two new fully programmed keys at quite a savings over the dealer!
B00757E7LE|3|The antenna looks good as I did not want a huge antenna whipping all over the place when I am offroading.  The antenna does not pick up that well in areas that are hilly.
B00CQ7ZSRU|5|Fits well over my Gringo Helmet and, more importantly, glasses. Haven't had any problems with fog. Now bug splatted.
B000QUN7GI|5|great price.
B00LGKXI66|1|Not happy with product and I could not use it. It came with connectors which didnt have.
B00393NDHW|2|not that bright
B00KQXC2J8|1|It did not fit
B000637TNM|5|I have used this before and it works well to soften new leather.
B006MIX7U4|5|Grea
B00YI3IGA6|5|These are amazing. I drive a 2014 Ford Focus and at first I was a little skeptical. The material is soft and breathable but it didn't look like there was ANY way that was getting onto my window. I don't even drive a huge car but it just seemed near impossible. Well it fit and even with someone as clumsy as myself, went onto the window within seconds. I don't have kids but I do love driving with the windows down without the excess heat and bugs coming in. I have a 4 month old jack russell terrier pup and this was perfect for him. I could roll down the windows and give him some fresh air, and even though the view is a bit diminished, he still had a blast. Also, he put his paws on it and it didn't pop off or rip. (I also keep his nails regularly groomed). I haven't taken them off although they are a bit of an adjustment, I use my mirrors primarily for driving but it's just seeing it in the corner of my eyes. I've driven at night with it and with all the humidity and gross bugs it's still providing a wonderful service to me! I definitely think these are worthwhile, if you live where there's heat and you've got little ones, fur or not... these are perfect for protecting them for too much heat, bugs and other elements! Five stars!<br />purchased at promotional price for testing and reviewing, all opinions are my own.
B00CZDUI52|5|Was good
B008S8YOIK|4|good for the money
B002UBZKUC|5|Perfect!!
B001F1WGV4|5|Perfect fit!  Very nice sunshade.  Would definitely purchase again - product seems very well made, minimal say and realm cuts the interior temperature on hot Texas days.
B00PHS34QW|5|A good red color but so bright it might look &#34;washed out&#34; close up. A very rich red color when when you look at the light it casts. So far no issues, works well and is about twice as bright as my stock bulbs were.
B00455QSF2|5|thay are very good
B005Y1T6VO|1|bad .  no good
B00LMJPCO2|4|No real big complaints, it works, bends easy be careful
B000KE0T3O|4|This product is Dark Grey, not Black. Be forewarned if the color is important to your selection.
B007ISGIOE|5|This intake was simple to install. Also it sounds great and gives the challenger a little bit of an extra boost while driving.
B00VXNK490|5|Great protective device for driving.  Good coverage, clear vision, no distortion.  Arrived in good condition and in timely fashion.
B0106UZX78|5|Love it!!
B00BFE59LA|2|This is the wrong part. There was a part change mid year. This is only good on early year trucks.
B000C7UTMK|5|good
B00COYNZJ8|3|It absorbs the heat so taking it down it's impossible to touch because it is so hot.
B00EC0ZD56|5|Muy buen producto
B0029EWPN0|3|Excellent product quality and easy application. Only negative was on my behalf. Ordered &#34;low profile&#34; instead of the regular set. Just doesn't allow for as much air to circulate. Looks great though!!!
B003057460|5|Great Product
B000CI1LO4|5|Works like a champ.  I screwed around with rebuilding my OEM starter for a few weeks then threw in the towel, actually, I threw this new NSA starter in and I've never looked back.
B001CUNFGI|5|A plus part and service
B000CF8VY0|5|Great product with easy installation.
B0009IBJE4|1|Sucks..Sucks..Sucks
B00JZQXJ3K|5|with 2 people, it took a grand total of 15 minutes to install both pieces. neither of us had ever done one before
B009AA9IN6|4|Fit and worked well but did not fix the shifting proplem, was an inepensive shot in the dark
B005BN46TM|5|very nice
B005LRD4YG|5|great just as described
B00L2RXKRA|5|good product - no difficulty applying.
B000IWFPIW|5|The larger bushing fit on the driver side wiper of my 2004 sunfire. Found the fix on a Pontiac forum where the instructions were to boil the bushing for a minute in some water. So far the wiper is working. Saved me a lot of money.
B0058OPUSK|5|Love it!
B00Y1HT2ZC|5|They worked.  The instructions were very good.  I could not use the start button, as the truck does not have that software install, I guess.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Work great.  Had them on for about three months now and all light work great and are extremely bright.
B0087XOTWW|5|great
B000CMHVGM|5|Thanks, fast shipping,  great product
B004TRKBOK|4|I thankfully have not had to use it, but it is light weight and easy to figure out.
B000IYPSZU|5|Perfect fit
B008CLLLKC|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B0029TQDLA|5|Protects and fit perfectly
B0006HNTW8|1|I need to contact the seller, please
B00YD2HN7O|1|No stars did get it to work
B00SUTHIVM|5|Prompt and professional delivery. Product is as described. Very useful
B00DLMMLRY|4|they work ok brights take some time to become bright.
B001PWA0IO|4|I've read the reviews.  DO NOT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR TIGHTENING!  Most people state they went 10-12 turns to tighten the nutsert.  I went 14.  The only portions of the instructions you should follow are: 1. Mark one side of the nut to accurately count the turns.  2. Use the Loctite.<br /><br />Biggest issue I had when installing it was the nutsert.  Just like the instructions stated I set up the allen bolt 3/4&#34; from the washer.  As I was tightening the nut, I wasn't watching the nutsert as I had it pushed against the tailgate.  The nutsert started turning and came off the bolt after 4 turns.  I used a small set of vise grips to hold the nutsert and install the bolt, this time screwing the bolt to 1/2&#34; from the washer.  My recommendation: Screw the bolt into the nutsert until the threads are just coming out the back of the nutsert, and you'll be fine.  When tightening the spreader nut, use a ratchet wrench if you have one.<br /><br />After 10 turns I checked to see how things were going.  The ball stud wouldn't even begin to start threading into the nutsert.  After 14 turns I installed the ball stud.  There's only 1/4&#34; of thread holding it in the nutsert.  Not so good when you consider there's about 3/4&#34; of thread on the nutsert.  It's not even half way in the nutsert.<br /><br />I closed and opened the tailgate a couple times slowly to make sure there wasn't any binding of the tailgate cable.  Then I opened it letting it drop, and closed it like I normally would.  Going down the dampener works as it should.  Going up there still wasn't any binding of the tailgate cable.<br /><br />UPDATE:  It's still working great!  Only down side I've noticed so far is that during the winter months, the oil in the damper gets a little thick.  I have to push the tailgate down slowly so I don't blow out the seals, otherwise it just hangs where I left it.
B004B68XGC|5|We have used this a few times now and love it. The carrying case that comes with it is very well made
B000C542LG|5|Great Quality and fit perfectly. The metal where the bolt goes is very thick and should take some abuse, installed on my 97 cherokee XJ. You will need a ball joint press to get these in, and to get the old ones out. It is not a fun job by any means due to the cramped space. You will need to jack the frame up to give you room between the axle and the engine to get the press in, the hardest part is getting the outer sleeve of the old one out, the press pushes the middle rubber out and then getting the rest out is a pain. If you have a pneumatic hammer it will make it a cake job. If I remember right it said on the box it was made in the USA also!!
B00N2ZFR0I|4|does what I wanted
B006YVYQUE|5|Fits my 2016 f350 crew cab like a glove
B000GV7CNG|4|They seem pretty solid to me and fit a 5'6&#34; fella on a Kawasaki Vulcan 1500A 88 pretty well so far. The big thing with bars is to get a style you like and figure out what measurements you want before placing an order. Once you get your measurements and style down, you just order a pair that you like.<br /><br />I did notice that on Arlen Ness' website, there is a picture of these in black, which I would have preferred although I can only seem to purchase the chrome style. That and the fact that they are a bit pricey is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.
B004I5RPM4|5|Fit perfectly, looks great. Installation couldn't be any easier.
B00Y1PMFQC|5|Using these injectors for my turbo 10ae miata and they work amazing! Idles perfectly and drive amazing. Pushing 250whp no problem
B000IY99LO|5|Others complain of a wine noise if not using oem brand hose, purchased this and with proper bleeding it works as designed. FYI buy the pressure switch with it.
B00042KG3A|5|Works exactly as expected! Great jack
B00FTB21SO|5|Works as described
B00429NKWK|5|I rarely ever write reviews unless I've been thoroughly impressed by a product, and this Sylvania headlight restoration kit did just that!  Like others have said previously, be prepared to spend 1-2 hours of time to complete the process for both headlights.  Be sure to follow the instructions to the &#34;T&#34; and don't skimp out or take shortcuts.  The better you prepare in steps# 1 & 2, the better it will look completed after step# 3.  Just for reference, I used this on a 2007 Ford Fusion.  The passenger headlight was faded the most while the driver side still looked fairly clear. However, I did both so they would end up the same.  While going through steps# 1 & 2, don't be disappointed if the headlights don't look any better (and possibly a bit more hazy).  As long as the haze on the headlight is even/smooth after wet sanding with the three different papers and rubbing the compound with the white cloth, everything should turn out just fine.  The magic happens in step# 3.  This is where the prep in the first two steps really shows.  The clear coat/sealant/protectant is like a magic swipe that brings the headlight back to new!  I highly recommend this product, and will definitely use it again.
B006X8BVRE|3|Let me just say i like the product but hated the hardware, they sent screws that i believe to be aluminum which strip easy, and i prefer to have pictures in the instructions but there were none with these. All in all they look good once they are in but it was a pain.
B006TQ0WUM|4|You have to have a tool to install the master link that comes with this tool. It does not come with the clip style master link.
B00WGYARIS|5|Installed these in my 2014 Camaro and absolutely love the look and the brightness. Couldn't be more satisfied with these lights. I ended up using the blue filter with them and they look amazing at night.
B00IGHGO4U|4|I got this quickly for mounting on my boat for bow fishing.  Looks to be high quality and left it out in the elements for the weekend.  Seemed to be waterproof with dew and rain.  My only complaint is the allen screw on one of the light mounts (i bought 2) was stripped out and allen screw wouldnt bite into threaded hole.  The screw looks like its in but is loose.  Appeared solid with the other screw holding.  I guess I'll find out how it holds up when it gets beat  around by a carp!  Good price otherwise.  Had to buy longer stainless screws to mount the way I wanted.
B00SZK1NKI|5|I must say that these fog light are so pretty. I love them and the way they look on my Nissan. I don't know how long they will last but I will enjoy them until they are gone then I will buy another pair.
B00KQPLJVI|1|The rack is solid, however it is very large.  You have to take it on and off in order to get the bed down.  We have a hybrid camper.  The rack is not meant for an easy on /off so it is not functional.  Also, based in the width, we had trouble using it with our 3 bike rack.  The rack was too wide to accommodate turns.  It is best with a two bike rack.
B00WSSHVK4|5|Perfect !
B000B8JUNY|5|Good replacement cap for 2002 Honda CR-V. Old cap was loose and I kept getting a cel.  This is cheap and quick fix.
B003NU0EM8|1|Really poor quality.... Would make a good child's toy
B005I7JAX8|3|Purchased with the intention of being able to  reset lights on the family's three VW( 2010 2.5, 2010 TDi and 2013TDi) without having to  fork out $600+ for a rosstech kit. Unfortunately didn't work to my hopes, but I'm going to keep it to use in the future. All features worked fine on a non VW.
B00GYZQ73E|5|I love this sticker. It looks great on my car window.
B00B7A98QE|3|Make sure you are getting the specific replacement bulb for your vehicle. Getting close is not acceptable.
B001G7YBP6|5|No problems.  It's a little tricky getting the old one out of the dashboard.  For me it helped to pop out the bezel.
B000C9RO12|5|Fits properly as it should. The AC Delco Professional line are aftermarket parts that frequently differ from the factory parts but this one looks almost identical to the OEM tie rod end. The boot is not permanently affixed as on the factory part and it is a couple ounces lighter but otherwise the dimensions and design appear to be the same. Hopefully this one will last 8 years and 255,000 miles as the factory part did. I normally use the GM factory part but it was not available on Amazon. I have very few negative experiences with the AC Delco Professional parts and Amazon's prices for AC Delco and GM parts typically can't be beat.
B00QKUXEGQ|5|Just what I expected.  I haven't installed it yet, but the quality seems really good.
B004RCXD0G|5|works fine
B008BBTASI|5|Quality steel and looks incredible..<br /><br />Make sure you buy a lock for it!!
B000BQSIWK|5|would recommend
B001Q7VS1G|5|Best ever......
B007CDYWSE|5|K&n quality. They have never let me down. Quick shipping. These are cheaper than what auto parts stores want for their lower lol filters
B00AWNVKTK|5|as advertised
B00D2I0IAE|5|husband likes this.
B00KRLROFQ|5|Looks and works great.
B00GHKMKT6|5|With my Euro Honda Accord, received OBD codes P1248 and P2138, which appears currently, as I learned.<br />Honda asked about 500€ for repair, which was clearly overpriced for a well known defect of this car and an easy<br />home repair (less than one hour, and easy access). Not so easy to find the piece in my country, but here is<br />a good price, and me and my car are happy now.
B009DJZ57C|5|Perfect fit
B00OCX7M8O|4|the drive belt is a s***, the belt is too short by 1/4 inch,when i install and try to start my vtt is the same as in position to drive,but the vtt is in position to neutral,the vtt won't start ok, is very bad the vtt have a difficulter to start normaly,is very bad for my vtt,don't by this kind of drive belt for save money,you pay more on the dealer but the quality is very good quality and longevity ,the drive belt dealer is the bestand your vtt run good and the belt is good for more long time,thank you
B00RZ1TKYE|5|I received this as a gift from my fiance'.  I often work late nights, and he was worried about me being out on the road and having car troubles somewhere with no cell service.  I've never needed to use this for myself, but I DID use it to jump start a co-workers car.  It's easy to use, and super easy to store as it isn't huge and bulky.  I highly recommend it!
B00D3298A0|4|Needed new floor mats for our 2005 Suburban, these fit and work pretty well
B00FIXICP4|2|The plate in the photo looked great.<br />The plate that I received was bent.
B0037DD3RO|5|This is not for making Pot Roast, folks. This is a practical, purpose-driven pot / mug / lid set designed for the backpacker to boil water for dehydrated meals and hot drinks, to keep said contents hot for extended periods, and eat and drink from without scalding themselves.<br /><br />The fact that, while researching this kit, I had to sift through reviews claiming it's &#34;too small&#34;, criticizing the flimsy Foon which GSI throws into many of it's cooksets, and warning of the risk of getting scalded by trying to pour boiling water into another container with the pot gripper (don't do that), speaks volumes for people who lack the basic skills and human ingenuity to safely engage in the very activities this terrific set was designed for.<br /><br />The capacity of .6 liters tells the initiated that it is large enough to boil two cups, with enough room left over to safely grip the edge of the pot with the silicone grabber, lift it off the flame, and set it in it's coozy without scalding your digits (though zoning out during this step in the process is ill-advised). Coincidentally, two cups of boiling or near-boiling water happens to be a commonly recommended amount to re-hydrate and heat most commercially produced two-serving backpacking meals designed to be hydrated inside their own pouch. These yield a portion large enough to sate the appetite of most any hungry hiker.<br /><br />The pot is very durable, and nearly as wide as tall, so it's quite stable. The coozy is soft, flexible, insulates very well, and has a little hole centered in the bottom to eventually help perplexed individuals remove the pot from it's coozy if it is snug, as well as allowing air to escape when inserting the pot.<br /><br />The lid is dual purpose without being gimmicky. It is designed to be applied upside-down during cooking, as it may be gently placed on and lifted from the pot without fitting tightly. This eliminates the need to exert any force to remove it, which could possibly cause spillage. When the pot has been transferred to the coozy using the grabber, you then can safely pour the hot contents into another container if desired, or if a hot beverage is on the menu, you can flip the lid right side up and press it firmly onto the pot. The silicone seal fits securely for spill-free sipping on the go. I have dropped it, full of hot coffee, and was able to quickly recover it, lid still tightly affixed, with minimal loss of java. The lid's sip hole is situated above and slightly inside the circumference of the rim of the pot, so one's lip never comes near the hot metal. The lid's outer edge is a flange extending slightly beyond the circumference of the pot rim, minimizing the chance of burning your fingers in the event one doesn't have the coozy's top edge butted up to the lid flange. When you experience how well this combo holds heat you will appreciate just how thoughtful this design is.<br /><br />It has been my experience that Halulite holds heat way better than even double wall titanium (which you shouldn't cook in anyway). So if cold weather adventures are your thing, This is definitely a more viable option.<br /><br />Pot-only weight comparisons with titanium pots of equal volume are negligible. You certainly may take foil for a lid if you feel the need to go full-on gram weenie. I doubt a reflectix coozy would be more than a couple grams lighter than the minimalist's splendid jacket if at all. If you forgo the lid and coozy for the foil, however, be advised that you may again be at the mercy of the aforementioned skills and human ingenuity, or lack thereof.<br /><br />This pot would look out of place on your Dragonfly, and wants a diminutive alcohol or canister stove to keep in line with the whole efficiency theme. Stoves which direct heat and flame more upward than outward work best and should reduce boil times and make the most of weighty fuel. Non-pressurized alcohol stoves have given me great results. My Zelph Fancee Feest, a wonderful modified cat-food stove, carefully centered, completely cups the Minimalist pot in a wall of solid blue flame oozing nearly halfway up the sides, hitting full boils with as little as .5 oz. of Heet, with very little waste.<br /><br />With regard to the ridiculous Foon, which reviewers rail on and on about and knock stars off for... give it to someone who is easily amused, leave it at home, or throw it out. Few other brands sets, if any, include an eating utensil. And why knock off a star because a useless piece of plastic is included, the disposal of which only grants additional weight savings. I take a titanium long spoon for bags. If your food scoop must nest inside, search online for lexan or titanium spoons or sporks and cut or file it to fit. I don't use sporks. I don't like holes in my spoons. If I want a fork, I whittle one.<br /><br />Lastly, when you take into account the spectacular under $30 price tag, this rig eclipses titanium cups of equal volume. It's a no brainer. I'm going to buy a couple more.rful modified cat-food stove, carefully centered, completely cups the Minimalist pot in a wall of solid blue flame oozing nearly halfway up the sides, hitting full boils with as little as .5 oz. of Heet, with very little waste.<br /><br />With regard to the ridiculous Foon, which reviewers rail on and on about and knock stars off for... give it to someone who is easily amused, leave it at home, or throw it out.

B00UEMH5L6|5|Looks great and very easy to install!
B001KSGNGG|4|Works great and now but Nissan Pathfinder sounds like a big rig with all the fan noise.
B000CH5I1W|5|price is right, it fits, where else can you get a heater core for a 1969 442?
B00KVOOIMQ|5|great price, works great.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Definitely keeps sunlighr out. Customer service is also good at contacting.
B003UT3XKC|4|Smells great.  When using on tires, it seems to get stuck in the raised lettering.  Doesn't stay blacked out at long as I would have hoped.
B008I7PDDG|5|Fit great, quick delivery, Perfect
B000JFJLP6|5|I've had to use this about 3 times now and it works great - would highly recommend
B00NH92LOO|5|Bueno
B0002SRJD6|5|just as  we  needed
B003YYW78W|2|Very hard to work with and the dot on my I is crooked. World design dropped the ball on this one.
B00Y0I90Z4|5|Sounds great & Good performance boost would definitely recommend it.
B006N97HDU|5|Great for the price
B000H8U1WM|5|great deal
B00B51X1JU|5|Easy install, perfect match on the paint color.
B008MCJSRO|5|Awesome product. Arrived on time fits perfect and performs well. Very pleased with the product and vendor.
B00VVFLGK6|3|Fits the same as OE not as strong. Had to take back out after first time I turned them on. the tab on the splined shaft wasn't tight enough to seat properly. Had to put small washer on and tighten down
B001CEJH0W|5|Great price and worked perfect.
B00877SL2M|2|These lights were pretty good for a while. They were bright and have that cool blue color. However after a month or so they began flickering on and off.
B00VX2NOK2|5|works good can keep track of my temps. just what is needed for 6.0
B009S94NX4|5|they fit perfectly, i don't buy things on line very happy with my purchase
B010OBP2N4|5|fits great but should be sold in pairs
B00WMK6Z46|5|Great fit and great color!!  I'm a busy mom of 3 football players and my truck interior was getting destroyed by all the mud and dirt the kids were bringing in, not to mention the everyday spills. These mats are a life saver!! Very durable and easy to clean. Well worth the price!! I'll be ordering a set for the car next.
B00FB3GDXE|5|Good quality fast shipping
B0009IK5VC|1|Did last long, maybe a month
B00LQHR9GE|4|Nice light bar , really bright , cost effective.
1888000139|4|For the price these things are awesome, I still would rather buy a name brand quality part but these are good, just don't expect the halos to work very long
B00X2C51LQ|4|Clear
B000IY8ODS|5|Looks great, works great.
B00ICR1UB6|5|Does as advertised!
B00FRHOI86|3|Not the best on Mini Cooper's, fit is a little off and they have a slight lift at higher speed =/
B0038DCKY0|5|Beautiful color and shipped on time
B00LNJI1KI|5|Works great
B008G1Z190|2|Lenses fits fine and looks good but aluminum trim piece is poor quality and fits badly
B009TBUOLG|5|Great well machined product~very happy with relocating my speedo to the tank mount! it clears my vision of the road and less to distract me!
B00KV8U254|2|bulb is fine, but the light color is yellow(3k color) not White( 5~6K  color)
B000EVYGZA|5|Very good meter. Use it a lot.
B003EP2XA8|4|It clearly stated it was a red tank in the sale but a black tank showed up.  Not a deal breaker but not what I ordered. Threads will need to be cleaned off as others have noted.  Tank seems sturdy and comes with a bunch of hardware including mounting bolts.
B000IYLHY6|2|While the fuel pump is working perfectly fine and fixed the leak with the new gasket. The float isn't working jumps from a quarter to empty and doesn't change even though the car has plenty of gas.
B00JHK81X2|5|came with everything it said it would. love the flashlight since it doesnt need batteries.
B011QXQ8D2|4|Pretty good lights for the price comes with mounting brackets and screws for the flush mount and I had to use the brackets and they are kinda difficult to put on and tighten but other than that very pleased with the output of these lights very durable have them mounted on bottom of my bumper as fog lights and drove threw creeks and mud actually stopped in the mud turned them on and they we're fully submerged and kinda was lighting up the mud great lights only gave 4 stars due to the actual brackets but they are flush mounts so 95% of people will actually use them how they are meant to be used.
B00CB8WM2S|5|good to have.
B0091LY190|4|Really nice decal. My only issue is that it's kind of difficult to place on a window (or at least mine was). Each dot and some of the fins have to be applied separate, and I had to be really careful around the lower jaw area due to thin materials, it can be easily pilled apart or even fold onto itself. It would be nicer if the adhesive side could be directly applied to the window rather than have to be removed from the backing then placed on the window. Simply put, if this decal could be placed on the window all at once it would be perfect.
B001THRG9Q|2|It came out ok I thought the other one gives it a shine but it didn't
B004GE51PA|5|Had some front end damage after an encounter with the back end of a larger truck, this replacement part fit my truck perfectly and after I painted it to match, my truck looks even better than before.
B0049EZDZ0|4|Fantastic product!!! Would have given it 5 stars but THEY SENT ONE WRONG SIZED FITTING!!!! Had to run all over town to buy another propper fitting the day before I had to leave towing a trailer 2400 miles and I had to have this installed!<br /> Other than that it works great! Keeps temps down, transmission shifts perfectly and I have peace of mind.
B00JTUBTQG|5|Seems to be a good brand so my mechanic that does my oil changes tells me,  and least expensive.  Im not a mechanic and so thats all I can say
B00LAF2TZ8|4|Very nice and delivery was fast
B00JGU58U2|2|This product is not a good fit for the 2015 Nissan Altima. The back seat covers were exactly the same for top and bottom, which doesn't cover headrests nor fit presentable. The headrest covers for the back of the car were made for cars with removable headrests.
B009PPL604|4|works well!
B00BT1GXUA|5|good
B004BTIH2E|5|Excellent OEM replacement. Solved my problem with the Service Engine Soon light. Nice price and free shipping. Can't beat that.
B0006IX87S|5|grate
B00I51L3TI|5|What a great buy. The backseat mats were even included. They were delivered very fast.
B004BCJBY4|2|I bought because of the price, headlights mounted in car and the screw holes lined up, but headlights did not quite match the body lines of the car..its a high milage old car.. that was not a big deal, it was close enough..<br />  The sockets for the turn signal/running lights were both shorted to ground, and blew the fuse for the running lights.  I used the sockets from the old head lights to replace the faulty sockets on the new headlights, and all was good.
B00ZZO01Z0|5|Thay work great .
B00VS0T7IC|5|very solid piece. should last forever!
B00O4G21W6|5|Works well and looks great, couldn't ask for more.
B00QONSABS|5|Great value
B00DZPC5NM|5|These were super easy to set up.  All we did is put the batteries in, turned the movie on then turned the headphones on and they worked automatically.  Haven't used the remote but super happy with the headphones!
B003S6IF14|5|Worked excellent Easy to install with a little mechanical ability. I will have to see how long it last So I will not comment as to quality
B009DJQWEC|4|Fit was off and left a little gap but was pretty good all in all
B004FLV0NG|5|Okay
B008XNZZ7O|5|Perfect for getting rid of smoke smell in car.  Does not have an over powering scent and lasts a while.
B000FGI34E|5|Works great
B004A6K604|5|Fast delivery and a perfect match.
B00Z89I2OY|5|Great, awesome product!
B0010E1LYY|5|Exactly as advertised.
B0009PSAWQ|5|Very satisfied.
B00J97X2YG|3|It's a Jeep Cherokee. It helps some. I don't want to buy another one.
B0040CTYAQ|5|Worked very well for replacing the broken retainer clips in my door.
B002WQLS1K|4|Price and product met my expectations.
B0093QKNCW|5|as expected
B00X4JFW8Y|5|Works like they said it would,good stuff!
B006WBHIF6|5|Item came as advertised and on schedule.
B00FW1JP2G|5|looks so much better
B004I0FFC6|5|Lights are ok. No prob so far.
B0013LAL90|4|I think for the money these are decent, good-looking bags.  They aren't stiff and while the sides are soft and thin, this allows for more flexibility when storing items, but for $70 they fit well and since I just got them I can't review the wear and tear.  My problem is that Amazon states the dimensions to be : 17.8 x 13.7 x 9.4 inches.  When they arrived I measured them to be 16x10x6.5 .  So I went to the Jafrum site and they state the dimensions are 18Wx10.5Hx7.75D inches.  So they are much smaller than they are stated to be.  However, I think I'm going to keep them...they look like they were made for the bike and they hold enough for my use.
B00KTITCRU|1|Couldn't get it to work...waste of money...
B00F90MJ3M|5|just what I was looking for
B000E0ZB5U|5|Ordered this relay when my A/C on my 2002 Ranger would constantly cycle on and off (mostly off). Popped out the old relay, dropped this one in, and had nice, consistently cold air in just a few seconds.
B00KL3ALGO|5|These shades are the best! Way better than anything else out there, they really provide sun protection while I'm driving and stay put without being in the way! I was getting sun spots from driving; now I don't even feel the sun in my face. Thank you for a great product!
B004U3THY8|5|I love my black nuts! Deez nuts are awesome! Way better than the hollow capped nuts that came on my 2010 Charger R/T. And they look great with my blacked-out grille and chin spoiler. Plus it deters wheel thieves, too. Would buy again for another vehicle.
B003BZINKU|5|Purchased this wiper for our rear window of our 2010 VW Jetta Sportwagon TDI. Installed easily, and will purchase again.
B000GQ6LF6|5|I looked at several hitches for our 2015 Chevy Equinox.  I settled on the Curt based on the feedback of others.  It took about an hour to install this hitch myself.  It fit perfectly.  I also was impressed with the neat thread on wires that allow you to pull the inside bolts in place.  I was a little skeptical when I read about them, but I was able to get them in place in about 3 minutes.  The finish of the hitch is really good and the hitch fits snugly into the rear bumper.  My wife didn't even notice I had installed it.
B003D4O9JS|5|Deep tone. Love it!
B002I2KI2S|5|Received earlier than date projected- quality piece! Will purchase from again! Highly recommended. A++++ (I did mess it up putting it on my car- do not recommend applying when it's windy lol- ended up having to take it off, will buy again!)
B00H4Y6TWS|5|works great
B00HZH66ZY|5|I just got this yesterday but so far so good. Make sure you follow the directions. I now have daytime running lights and can use my fog lights and high beams together. I'm using the 87 octane mode. Not sure about horse power but the throttle response is much better and sounds throatier. I'm also running afe catback, throttle body and intake. Curious to try the other modes.
B005ZWM0R4|5|Very impressive for the price!
B007QVWDGK|5|This guy always comes through. Nice product with quality graphics.
B001AVSIOI|3|Kind of sloppy on my 04 2500HD. About a half inch too long, and the red anodization looks pink, so you better be confident in your manliness.
B004UMB7WY|5|This item is pretty expensive however it works.<br />I opted to get a larger bottle as my white car was layered with rail dust.<br /><br />Took about 3-4 rounds and wiping the car down followed by clay bar but with this product it takes half the time versus just claying.
B00AX05U7A|5|very high quality plate
B0066SVOE6|4|Worked for me. USE A CHANNEL LOCK TO HOLD IT AT FITTING END. The original bolt will most likely break off, but you need to reuse the clip on there. It is a common metric M6x10 bolt; I had a motorcycle bolt bin with one that fit. This unit really should have come with the fastener...if another unit does and it is $2 more then buy it. ...otherwise 5 stars.
B005K79I60|5|These lights work great. They have side or top mounted options. They really helped brighten up my trailer.
B0012TWSSA|5|Coooooooooool.
B00V6XRZCG|5|it works...That is a plus :)
B0084AA2LK|1|Did not work on simple repair.
B00863N870|5|I must say that this Dashcover fits my Nissan Altima and look gooooooood. The quality is there and my dasdhboard look richer. My Automobile (Ruby) smiled and is yet smiling because of how it look. (Thanks!)
B000HS4QA0|5|love em cofortable and grip is excellent
B001NQQ9WI|5|My son loved this for his Jeep!
B00K8E0WAG|1|This battery lasted less than 1 hour with my minn kota trolling motor.  It was a big disappointment. I hauled 2 of them 900 miles and 14 miles in my canoe and when I needed them to work they lasted less than 1 hour per battery. Don't count on getting any where with this battery.
B0050LU2GQ|5|works great!
B00QFZUVH6|4|A bit hard for one person to handle but it works
B0031HEIDY|5|Super bright and a very white color, not as white as my LED running lights but close enough. Been a while since I installed them and have had zero issues with these. Highly recommend!
B00RW7WSQI|5|Good quality, easy to install. I brought it from Wiper Master.
B00IS94NL2|5|Grille looks great. Good quality and paint is nice and glossy.
B00N8AO9FQ|3|These are of a nice quality. I love the print. Disappointed it doesn't fit better. I suppose a good fit shouldn't be expected for a universal seat cover. The head rest cover is so big I decided to leave it off. The back is too tall so the fit is very loose. Of course, it covers the pocket on the back of the seat.  It's basically impossible to hook the attached loops under the car seat as instructed. Not snug at all and moves a lot when I get in and out. It's better than my ripped up leather driver's seat, I guess. My passenger seat is in great shape so I didn't bother putting the seat cover on. I think I world have been happier putting this $80 towards the $200 price we were quoted to have the driver's seat reupholstered.
B00EEQBVG8|4|Good bang for the buck. Took a little playing with to get the feel for it. Can't share 1 Bluetooth player between 2 helmets but other than that, very satisfied for the price !
B008M7SVBS|1|Didn't like .
B003IS3HV0|4|Really thick formula but with some patience you can work it into your leather furniture. Does leave my chair looking better and the smell is nice.
B007Q423SA|5|Very nice and bright, thanks!
B004JAV30I|5|good . havent tried it.
B000CM0WZO|5|excelent product
B003TY154E|1|Doesn't fit for KWI key even though it describe that will fit. Cost another $ 2.50 to make a copy and then.......throw it away because can't use it.
B001FAM59I|2|I ordered this for a 1994 Chevy extended cab 2 door , this was for a suburban. too long
B00RM327NG|5|The magnet is Very strong and therefore useful for its purpose.
B00TQ07IOQ|4|Ok fit. Great for the price.
B004KEKAY8|5|Nice stuff!
B00JFM2CO6|4|PERFECT FIT AND GOOD LOOKING ON THE 2005 CHEVY !! LIKE A ROCK.
B002801NI8|3|not same size as my cars bolts little smaller
B00H7H06JE|5|A great value
B00JK9MMI0|4|I have these flood lights on my tractor and UTV , these are not driving lights, just flood lights for working or backing up in woods
B00CIGWU52|2|Nice item, only too big for my application
B00H6XPZN6|4|i ordered this for the benefit of my daughter as she was always seating at †he back seat with the sun rays directing at her.<br />This helps to block the sun on her face as she always complains..<br /><br />this is very easy to use and very easy to install, the suction cups needs to be push hard to make it work very well what i did is i spray a little bit of water so it can work as it is..<br /><br />this is kinda thin but it does its work!
B0082JZYI4|5|Works good & so much cheaper than I could find locally.
B000N4TJCS|5|A SUPER set of mats!!!
B002UC6VGS|5|People talk about cheaper ways to clean their RV but this stuff works right away.
B008ECCBFS|5|Received promptly. Easy to install. Works well.
B00KBJ8X0E|5|Husband got his dream car and loves anything with corvette on it, it will hang in the garage where he parks his car.
B003N8J6A6|5|RECEIVED IN SATISFACTORY CONDITION
B000BYDA8E|5|vroom vroom
B00IRWFQUW|2|They both broke right away. :(
B003888CPG|4|Fits as described.
B000AA4RWM|5|Works great
B000C55MQK|5|Put these on my 2003 Dodge Caravan and it rides awesome! I use my van to haul kids, lumbar, flooring, etc...and these shocks perform great. They are a bit stiffer than stock but they are good for what I use the van for. They are sort of like a strut and I believe they are helping my aging leaf springs quite a bit. At this point, I am confident these will outlast the life of my van. If you have an old Carvan with +100k miles and need to replace rear shocks don't look at anything else...buy these!<br /><br />PS- Never thought my first Amazon review would be on shocks for my minivan, but I am so happy with the performance.
B002P3LLR6|5|These are a great color for the sun and comfortable to wear
B000GZGV3E|1|I ordered 6 plugs, got 5 in box.
B00G0MGI2G|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00495WK5U|1|wrong size
B00ONOO1MW|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B0002SQVNA|5|Good stuff!
B0007MCTQ4|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00E9FS3QK|4|I was pleased with it
B00I9299IK|5|Great replacement horn for the Kia Sedona.  Had to modify so the wiring harness so it would work with the Kia harness.  Had to use the male connectors from the old horn.
B004BT7PS6|1|Wrong part, so no comment!
B008L4VKX8|5|They work great and look good too!!!
B000IETT0A|5|Excellent! The little rubber grommets were useless, I threw em away. Once you push the plastic screw through the factory seal you have to really push hard to get it screwed into place. It's impossible with the rubber grommet. Deflector does stick out about an inch from the vehicle which looked strange at first but quickly grew on me. I love it. Excellent quality too, thick material. A little side note- The Ventvisors on my Pilot are also Auto Ventshade and they as well are very durable and serve a good function.
B004940ZNK|5|2007 Pontiac G6.  Very easy repair.
B005KDO8U0|3|Haven't noticed a huge difference over the factory bulbs. The hue seems to be just a little brighter but for the price they are worth using as replacements
B002HGCV8O|1|Not made in USA, made in China.
B00FBSFZQU|5|I used this on my boat trailer.  It was easy to install and are noticeably brighter without being obnoxious. I have yet to put the boat in the water with these on, but I am told they are waterproof and they do look to be.
B00FRHOLK6|1|Live in Colorado - anything below 20 degrees and these are horrible. Turn rock hard and chatter across the windshield. Now writing this review after having for less than a year and they are history all together - leave big streaks and hardly better than letting rain just pummel the windshield. End of summer so haven't lasted in our Colorado environment I guess.
B00M0TLQ66|3|The stuff works some what.Works good on lite rust, heavy rust is another thing there is some change, but still better then doing  nothing
B003U657QI|3|I'm a big guy , tall also I ordered a 3x it was a tad small. I don't see any info on how to return the item. That being said. It seems like a nice riding jacket for the price
B000BZI4JI|5|Excellent, easy install and already had anti-seize on threads
B00U2II0PM|5|Great product. Packaging should be improved...
B00G9ARJMC|5|exact fit for 2014 crv awd.  Honda packaging, just as advertised.
B0010EB6QW|5|Fits the 2004 Nissan Xterra perfectly. Very inexpensive (especially give the Charcoal in it).
B007JSGR9Y|4|Worked as needed
B000IY3K6O|5|These are not for the strongest and shortest race car like stopping, but they do stop very well, inspiring confidences while being perfectly tamed for luxury tier vehicles.<br />For example, a sportier car will have a harsher ride quality, because of its stiffened suspensions versus a (high-performance) mid to luxury vehicles which will sway more, but will also absorb road bumps and skips.<br /><br />That was the honest and best I can describe these brake pads characteristics. Yes I recommend them over whatever OEM Acura uses, because they initially do feel and perform better then stock.
B00GHUHPGE|5|Well made and easy to work with. Installation is a breeze when using the right installation method. I highly suggest you visit the 1060graphics.com website to watch there installation video if you've never installed any type of stripes or graphics before. If you've ever installed stripes or large graphics before, this item will be very easy to install with the same methods and techniques.
B00DX89IOU|1|Don't have options to choose the size
B004PPZJCA|5|Installation was easy once I found a shop that was able to weld the flange in.
B00144CSR4|4|An excellent lock, but God help you if you want a replacement.  McGard produces an excellent variety of wheel locks, but one thing that would be remiss of me to mention is if you plan to buy a lock key or additional number of wheel locks.  The enclosed insert with all McGard lock kits show a ridiculous price list for extra parts.  I wanted another key in case, God forbid I lost it and needed to remove the tire; 10.95 USD, and another wheel lock for my spare 14.95 USD, plus another 4.95 USD Shipping and handling.  Now granted, if I was careful and don't loose the first wheel lock key and use other options for securing my spare I could forgo the 30+ USD, but I would hate to realize I either have to wait a week to get another wheel lock key or destroy my lock and threaded wheel stub just so I can go done the road if I have a flat or blow out.  I mention the USD as if you're buying in Canada, add another $5 CD.  Hence the 4 star rating, though the locks work and appear to be of excellent craftsmanship.
B0007M3D4G|5|Great quality
B004EK94P4|1|Quality is poor.  Very surprised.  The black dpi is poor.  Also scratches TOO easily.  The 1st one I put on my rear glass gained 2 scratches.  I stood back, gave a disgruntled exhale… then removed it.<br /><br />I have 3 ready to give away.
B00SSD5M8Q|1|These bars suck Pass wires through bars for throttle by wire it's so sharp inside the bars that it cut every water inside they do not take the time to file or grind the sharp edges down inside the bars I have to purchase a whole new throttle by wire kit the bars are not good they don't fit right all around they suck
B000GAQ166|5|Just what I wanted thank you
B00NPY0TXG|5|Fast shipping! Works perfect!
B00ODVEWPG|5|Nice reading light for the RV.
B00NJRGD70|4|It does the job but is a bit awkward due to it being so &#34;springy&#34; but on the othe hand, this also makes it more flexible to work with.
B00GUBUV6G|5|Fits perfect. Passenger side 2007 Saturn Ion
B00OFM7660|1|The sent wears away within hours.
B0050VH4O4|5|works great
B00OBS1L1Y|5|Starter arrived quickly and fit like it should and I am very happy with the results.
B00IAZXOX2|5|Very easy to install and completes what Ford left out. Definitely makes the truck look much better!
B004GFS2C8|5|We got this to fix the small cracks in my Honda windshield- Darn rocks and the trucks that throw them :P
B000EVYH72|4|Does what its supposed to do.
B00J1KC8NM|1|Note that Coverking has changed model numbers to reflect Ram brand name vs Dodge brand, but the cover design issues remain.<br /><br />On my 2014 RAM 3500, The center defrost vent opening was mostly covered, resulting in poor and dangerous defrost performance. After multiple attempts to have this corrected, I eventually received one that had correct defrost vent opening size, but was considerably oversized in other width.<br /><br />Looking at the variations between several covers for the same dash, I see that the consistency in their manufacturing is poor.<br /><br />The &#34;Upper glove box door&#34; option amounts to a flap that goes over the glove door, which makes the cover move when you open the glove box door, and interferes with the door opening, so I ordered the version without that.
B000E0T4NK|5|Awesome price and it works well !
B00RCOG786|5|I like this keychain because it is a subtle nod to Harry Potter, a nice item for adult fans of the young adult books! I bought this item from the studio tour in London in January. Since then it has been on my keychain for work, so it has seen a lot of wear. I have been really satisfied with how it has held up. The center part spins, and it must be sturdily attached because I play with it a lot when I'm walking. The silver has worn off a little on the edges of the outer triangle, showing the copper underneath, but it isn't flaking or anything.
B00W4B54GS|5|Absolutely wonderful.<br />Dealership tried to scare me by saying they won't guarantee that the keys will work so you spend $230 with them.<br />I got 2 keys for under $40, they charged me $60 to program one key,  So I only had to spend $80.<br />My key works absolutely fine.<br />Thank you!
B00ABZCPR0|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised.
B0022WPMBQ|1|What these bags fit is for<br />Brand Fitment: Honda<br /> Model Fitment: VT1100C Shadow (1987-1997)/ VT1100C2 Shadow Classic (1995-2000)/ VT1100C3 Sadow Aero (1998-2002)<br /> Year Fitment: 1987-2002
B00O3QAWNM|4|Great CF but slightly wavy on the surface.
B004B61B34|4|Nice product
B00068OUAC|3|needed the longer ones my fault oh well
B001XLG5FE|1|It looks cute, and the first days I was really happy. But after a while I have seen how cheap and bad quality the material is. The suckers back part is so weak and small that the sunshade has fallen several times even if the sucker is still on the windshield. Tired of that, I attached some keychain rings to avoid it. The worse thing is that the red color has fade so much that now is pink and really bad looking. I expect that after some time, but I purchased this less than two months ago.<br /><br />It is cute, but I would never recommend this to anybody.
B0036UMYVO|5|Great Kit for doing a timing belt service.
B000JK2D06|5|took a while to find this, I originally bought it for protecting bare metal, but  it works great on painted sufaces as well. use it you wont be disappointed.
B000J1SQXI|5|I changed both rear tractor tires and used this kit with adaptors to fill them 2/3 full of water. My tubes had both the schrader valve size air connection, which I used for a few minutes before I screwed it out and used the larger adapter to fill a lot faster. This kit appears to be chrome plated brass and should last for years.
B00J4D518U|5|Nice
B00HY06TJA|1|dome lights dont fit on an 06 legacy
B00FX40B16|5|It gets the job done, no streaks, no squeaks, and no fuss.<br />Easy to install, well it would be if I could remember how, my<br />daughter had to show the old lady up and install it for me.<br />But it sure looked simple : )<br />It stood up to pouring rain, drizzle, and just regular old windshield washing<br /><br />Recommended
B00NQ01TC4|5|Fixed my issue
B00CF2QJCE|5|Used to repair kayak, worked great.
B000R3WQPM|5|This fits perfectly and is indispensable if you live in a hot climate. All that black plastic in my jeep makes the inside a furnace but this helps a lot.
B000A8QO5C|5|Fits my 2010 Honda Accord perfectly.  No mess and no worries!
B00PWLJH4W|4|Thought it was a sticker but it happens to be a decal of the lines and print. Really good quality! Dark print on dark windows won't show up very well.
B00RV83UUG|5|Excellent. Installed on my tracker boat and lis super bright.
B000CINVA6|5|I have an old door that binded really bad. It would not close all the way, that's how bad it was. So I went to a store and picked it up. After lubricanting everything, the garage door now opens and closes with no problems. Awesome stuff.
B00BTLEIIY|4|Greart product for the price.
B00MB0ET9K|2|It works like it says but has such a horrible chemical smell that does not go away. I finally took it out of my car because the odor was so strong.
B001TXIT0U|3|Awesome tank but I have a few issues. Petcocks are cheap and plastic. It came with a T connector instead of a Y fuel line connector. And the fuel line from the right side petcock is really close to the exhaust and it gets scary hot. Might just close the petcock and remove that fuel line
B005WK7VW8|5|Extremely happy with this cover on my 2011 Jeep Liberty. Great fit and looks nice too !!
B001UIM3N8|5|Cool JDM item for my sil-80 project.
B004809X9W|4|Worked very well
B00SC5EF6A|5|Is a very good kit unfortunately my transmission was melted and broken I can't fixed
B001KRY67A|5|Fits perfectly, works great!
B00ZM9LANA|5|This came in today and I'm so impressed with it for the price. The iPad Air fits perfectly.
B003YDY7YK|4|The item was fine. It work great . The only thing was recive two days late due the deliver service. But everything else is fine.
B0024VWGJG|5|OK
B00JJR74L8|5|This sticker looks great on my car window.
B000BUTD9I|5|No problems.
B0002MABGE|3|Had to return it as it was too small for the Honda Element.  Guess it might have worked for other cars?
B004KEKAY8|4|put on my 2015 Charger R/T  Shorter than stock so bottom of valve stem shows where as stock covers the brass up completely. Saw in reviews logo cap was coming off so used Krylon crystal clear acrylic spray 2 coats have had no problems. If you do spray looks like the R/T logo is blurred<br />but when dry crystal clear
B004QEKGA0|1|Very flimsy and easily shifts off balance.
B001N72FES|5|Works well
B00NON1VDA|5|Great light for the price a friend has a rough country 50 inch light bar and this light bar is just as bright if not brighter. Its very well built no water built up just for fun took it through about 15 automatic car washes to get water from every angle and not a single drip of water inside. Offroading it's been hit by tree branches and covered in mud and looks brand new still. Amazing lightbar defiantly recommend buying you will not regret it.
B005PZMLDY|1|I asked questions and researched the cloth covers for my car and they did not fit properly. It was very disappointing
B00FZE2U72|5|Fun.
B00U7GHGTA|2|work fine but not very bright at all
B007KA7PP6|5|Works great!
B00NF1RLC6|5|Excellent article.
B00OXZD9F6|5|Great product. Good price. Exact fitment. The car runs better with this filter than the regular ones. I would suggest purchasing
B0009YDQEE|3|I got these hoping they would fit my BMW, but they do NOT!  If you have a gas pedal attached to the floor, do not buy this as they will not fit.  Overall the quality and design seemed fine to me, just wouldn't fit my car.  That's the only reason I'm giving this 3 stars.  Don't trust the Amazon vehicle compatibility checker.  It lied to me on these.
B005T7PW0M|5|K&amp;n is great quality of many products. Their oil filters are outstanding. I am a mechanic. I would suggest running these filters.
B001PW9ZUI|5|I installed this with no problems on a 2005 Chevy Sliverado. It is now much easier to open my tailgate one handed, but most important. my wife likes it.
B00O08SO24|5|This thing is loud
B00EUZZK5G|4|looks good .
B000HUKKN0|5|PERFECT!
B005CLP980|5|nice
B000XG8Q0W|5|they work well.
B0036E9VB6|5|Best mobile pump I have ever used.  I would recommend this pump to even my best of friends and all my family.
B001NHAP36|5|just as described
B001HATUKS|5|Thank you.
B005EHYLFY|5|Great black and white sticker with good contrast. Educate yourself on the history of racism in Philadelphia politics and its justice system, then read about Mumia and his plight.
B0009IR0PQ|5|Just as &#34;magical&#34; as everyone claims! Buy a separate, softer brush though.
B00HHJLCU4|4|works good
B00KTJ0KA2|5|The key and the instructions to program was awesome
B000O0JQSS|5|Fit perfectly arrived promptly.
B00G6MMAI6|5|Looks great!
B008Y71HXU|5|Perfect fit on my 04 dodge durango.
B008VQLT8W|3|First time using this product ,,, so far good
B001JA4DFI|5|Good product.  Well made.  Works perfectly with my 08 Goldwing
B009AA2FAY|5|Great product - easy install
B00R6DQDBO|1|Will probably do the job, but they make the interior of my tundra look like cheap a piece of crap.  I would have been a lot better off just buying a can of carpet cleaner in the spring.
B00N1QEHS6|1|Absolute junk. The &#34;leather&#34; was accented by the most flimsy plastic, the &#34; universal&#34; adapters don't fit 80% of vehicles, and to top it all off it completely broke during installation.<br /><br />Save your money.
B00BFYGZXG|5|LOVE LOVE<br /><br />great colors
B004UPZXQM|3|i am a true user of sealants and spray waxes and i feel this one was good, but needs a constant larger amount to do the same as some other products i use
B0080J1200|5|Good product...Great price!!
B0027M3A1U|5|MAde my RV and my car shine like the day they were bought. Good stuff.
B003MB4NUC|1|Caps were not able to attach to the wheels, did not have clamps that attach to the lug nuts?
B00NLMHSV8|3|ordered the CC-344-XL1_DodgeCharger06-14CJ $39.20.  the description says four layer I don't see more then 2 on what I received, the photo displays a white inside and gray outside, the whole thing is gray, has two grommets on the center bottom, no tie down rope or fancy carry case but it does have a stout stretch bottom and fits perfect on my 91 Mercedes 300e ( the charger was the closest match i could find)  I probably could have gotten similar at walmart but for $39 and free shipping cant expect a whole lot
B003V9TC10|4|Not exactly what I expected.  Only needed them for two tires.  Two days after installation, one of my tires was flat.  Tried to air the tire but it would not accept air.  Took off the extender and checked it with the compressor and air passed through.  Not sure why it wouldn't accept air while installed on the valve stem.  Wondering if the valve should be removed from the valve stem before installing these??  Other reviewers have said they just use them to fill and then remove.  Probably a good idea as its no more trouble than removing the valve cap.
B008KZQWRM|5|We needed a replacement remote case and got this one, even though it said it wouldn't fit... IT DOES!<br />It comes with two fronts, one for remotes with  buttons and another for remotes with 5/6 buttons<br />It was very easy to replace, took less than a minute.<br />A GREAT VALUE!
B00NFJIF78|5|Ordered the part and it was identical to original factory part. After i installed it, I reset check engine light and the light stayed off. It was very easy.
B004QHJFAO|4|Satisfied.
B00FYDAP6M|5|Nice heavy-duty quality and works per design.
B00JCE0XUM|5|Fine
B004HE6UNQ|5|Complete kit for my brother's wife's H3, no install issues, OEM quality.
B00EP9BX6W|5|Fit as expected,  all good
B00GSAUHB8|4|I received this sun protector and i liked it. The size for good for my 4 runner and the corners were flexible to fit the windshield perfect! It was kind of tricky at first to fold and fit back into the pouch but it was easy once i figured it out. The only thing that i'd change is that the pouch be made with better quality. After being used a couple of time the stitching in the seams are starting to come apart.
B007PSOBZK|5|Looks great and works perfectly.
B0070I9HHW|4|Barely noticed any difference maybe a little but by design it will stiffen the rear end up a bit, was a pain in the a** to insert into the diff mount, but i just shaved the insert in the frint a little and it slid right in, and turned out to be a nice tight fit.
B004GFTC0E|4|Very good,<br />however, I highly recommend getting the Wipe New Headlight Restore Kit with it.<br />I used it to send down the top layer with my drill, and using the Wipe New to re-apply clear coat on my headlights
B0057FTYZA|5|Mechanic installed it no problem on my 2000 S70 (Non-turbo). Works so far.
B00SSVFQ2U|1|The LED's arrived on time (for what that is worth).<br /><br />I fitted the first one, only to see that it was hardly lit. I disconnected it and tried the second one, it seemed to be brighter. As I went to put the first one in the other side, I noticed that it rattled. The end bezel was loose, I tightened it, and the black plastic cover at the back of the 90 degree bend, fell off. So I had to crazy glue it back on.<br /><br />The LED's were fitted to my 2011 Dodge ram, in the fog light position. I fitted them in the daylight, they appeared to have a warm orange glow.<br /><br />At night, that's all there was ........ a warm orange glow! I can honestly say, that they provide absolutely no noticeable light on the road in front! I've tried them in normal driving conditions, and in fog conditions (which is where lights ~3k should be better), but there's nothing! I even performed a &#34;blind test&#34; where I quickly switched the lights on and off several times, so that I lost track of whether they were selected on or off ...... I then tried to tell whether they were on or off by looking out of the windshield ....... I COULDN'T TELL IF THE LIGHTS WERE ON OR NOT!<br /><br />So;<br />If you simply want an orange glowing light on your vehicle - you might like these.<br />If you want to illuminate the road ahead of you, in any way - FORGET IT!
B002OULRDI|5|like
B00LLI4IJE|5|I was not able to use this product, I returned it. I didn't see anything wrong with it but I didn't use them in my car.
B00IH8HO6U|5|Just as promised.
B00ODG73XO|5|very happy with purchase
B00BFDX0MQ|1|Ridiculous reviews. Total crap. I bought this based on a review I read about how strong it was, and it got bent just by being shipped. Made out of thin metal which my 13 year old daughter could easily bend with her hands.
B00OSM6BGS|5|Easy install looks like OEM
B00I9PJF6I|5|The rights carb. for the little truck,at a good price.
B00WP7REL4|5|Works fantastically!
B00LEZTKVA|4|Works fine for me on the Can Am Spyder.  If it does slip a little bit just rough up the steel ball a bit so it grabs.
B0031I207O|4|Owned one before, it's worth it for the price, even if you have to replace in annually.
B00FASBGLY|5|Matched perfect. Thanks
B00NKZ6ZUG|4|Just fine and includes hard-to-find ivy
B00FXY7W9U|5|I finally end getting the package, I almost submit a complaint but when I worked with the vinyl looked scratched but I don't know what happened,  after a few days, it just looks awesome !
B002UC8RN8|5|exactly what we needed
B00LZWWL22|5|Huge improvement from the stock exhaust and not nearly as loud as the other aftermarket options that exist for this bike. Great quality. Highly recommend this exhaust.
B000BQWLE6|1|I should have read the reviews. The title should really read mini. trash can. One soda can will fit but nothing else. How very disappointing!
B000CFOJ96|4|I have gotten pricier wipers, but these do the job just fine!
B01015871C|4|JUST PERFECT FOR MY CHEVY !!
B002H5I17A|5|Big filter shipped fast really made a difference on my superduty
B006A6JLLC|5|Great size for corn boards!
B00LBUAN46|5|Great wax pads for price !!
B004I0E9YG|5|Quick shipping perfect fit
B00IJEA7IY|5|These were perfect. Exactly as described. Exactly what we needed. No more. No less.
B00CJ7WOJ2|5|Arrived on time, the motorcycle likes it!
B000JZ58CG|5|Good Price
B000GU24HG|5|Good
B0012AURLE|5|Great
B00332GMF4|1|I own a 2001 Toyota Tundra and these side caps do not fit. They are about 4&#34; too large.
B0000AXTUY|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00RYPYNVG|5|Product as advertised and worked well.
B000B8LKZ0|5|Nice item. Seems like they have about a three or four year life span until they start developing rust.
B000GU3B8C|5|Thank's
B000FQ95J6|4|Its a good pump & definitely serves its purpose for me (air-up tires when I get off the trails).  I didn't realize that it requires its own separate mounting bracket.  Make sure you order a bracket specific to your vehicle- I have a JK 2007-2011 Left Hand Drive.  Additionally, I did not realize that this compressor requires you to install a separate power switch- I just assumed that there was a power switch on the compressor itself.<br /><br />Also, the compressor gets very hot (& its super hot in the engine compartment anyway- I only run the compressor when the vehicle is running) & I've actually popped a hole in the cheap plastic air hose that I have a couple times.  Here's a little tip if you can't avoid having a cheap hose near the super hot compressor- always keep the air running out of the fill side of the hose (even if its not attached to a tire or anything else) so the air pressure doesn't back-up too much. If there's too much pressure in the hose, & the hose is next to a heat source, there is more chance that the hose will pop.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy with the compressor & it really serves a purpose for me
B00IBOKH0U|5|These floor mats are unlike anything I ever seen! They fit just perfect and the coverage is great. They are made of some kind of a light weight carbon fiber material and have some kind of a material on the back that keeps them from moving unlike other floor mats. Only issue I had was they were a little tricky to install had to mess with it for a little bit to figure it out.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lightweight material<br />Made to fit well<br />Once installed they barely move<br /><br />Cons:<br />Hard to install<br /><br />I was really debating on buying weather tech floor mats over these and now I am glad I didn't I saved around $100.00 because of this choice.
B001XLG5FE|1|This did not fit my MINI Cooper. I sent it back.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great
B0097A9PDC|1|The fit was EXTREMELY tight and the ceramic broke on both pigtails. I would avoid these and go with the plastic ones.
B00KTI9UQ8|5|Arrived quickly. Easy to program. Works as promised.
B006WZOVHA|4|good
B00LNL3CGO|5|Perfect swap-out for the old Titan coupler and now part of the new brake system on the '97 Magic Tilt boat trailer.
B00DMIAKKM|5|Fits very well like original. No more leaks.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Does what its supposed to do, keeps my phone up to date
B00EC0Z1I0|5|this worked out just great!  I just now have to pay attention to the road and not hit mail boxes with my mirror while I am gawking at a garage sale on the other side of the road.
B0027UREVO|5|Fit great
B00HS5W1AW|5|fit great and they are very quiet they have improved my stopping distance greatly also . they look great on the car also .
B00BPDCSPG|4|don't like the turn buckel
B00JIIZCM6|5|Great stuff for cleaning my horse tack and saddles! It comes with its own sponge even! Definitely recommend this product for your leather goods!
B00BF0E58C|5|It's beautiful at night
B00JN6L3PI|5|Great item
B00PJK9JKI|2|There ok they don't last long
B001G640XA|1|Received order in a timely fashion ,easy install,immediately noticed crisper throttle response more power than this old truck has seen in a long time
B003S6F3IC|2|Everything works except auto up down button. Has to be something in the wiring because when I hook up old motor, auto up down works fine.
B00652G4TS|3|Great item,does  and works exactly as advertised.
B00KBKOAGY|5|Great quality and work exactly the way they describe I really enjoy them
B00EF3SOT2|5|It is well made looks good and meets my requirement of raising my wheelchair rack from bottoming out.  Their is some play side to side to make a easy mount.  My rack came with a clamp that fasten on the lip of the adapter and rack.  The chair ramps up from the side and keeps it  from rocking back and forth.   Chair weights over 300 lbs and rack is 80 lbs.  That is why I went with this adapter.
B009B3Y86E|1|The part number for this item, 27326, is not correct. What this item is, is a one-foot section of Gates Rubber Company Barricade fuel hose, 1/2-in inside diameter, 35 psi. Gates item No. 27326 is specifically for a 250-ft roll of this 1/2&#34; fuel hose. Had to return the hose, wasn't what it was supposed to be.
B0091PAFMI|4|Handy and more compact than standard large fire extinguishers that fit anywhere.
B00QXGM814|5|excellent product. it repaired what needed to be done
B00GSAUHB8|5|fast deliver<br />it provided full coverage from the sun<br />compact when not in use and storage bag is compact and fits pperfectly<br />awesome product
B00TKJX7NE|4|Only had it installed yesterday (08/18/2015) and it worked fine the first time.  Can't wait to start using it more often.<br /><br />Looks great in my garage!
B000C7S0Z8|5|Quick ship, well boxed, fit as described
B00N6QGQWG|5|Fits good and looks great!!!!
B00HV6XRBU|5|Works well great light output for floor lights in a 94 c1500
B00YJL8SXW|4|Great for the price. Have about 15k miles on them so far
B000CEP1RG|4|Does not have a snug fit into the slot where the stock one was but is still operational.
B00512NSZQ|3|Not bad but not the best material and design for the price.
B000E7WLJW|3|Too heavy for one person.
B00YDORJXK|5|Perfect tool.
B004940ZNK|5|This product did exactly what it should have done and fit perfectly. I would have never thought the installation would have been so easy, but it was. Google directions cause they don't come with them.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Bright as hell
B00XM107FC|1|I thoufht this would make the installation a 5 minute process. On the contrary, i had to modify it. I was skeptical on buying it, due to the other reviews. Product is terrible.
B001JSYC74|1|It scratched my window, it is so thick that my arm would be lifted on an angel and the material is not as comfortable as it should be. And it is a pain to push into a volkswagen window.
B00L844JBI|4|Good quality. Work well with an LED bulb.
B00R8KHH6K|5|My husband and son have super stinky feet! This stuff actually works and everything smells like leather :)
B00DYAQ1YW|5|I bought this for my husband. Delivered on time. Would recommend this to anybody that likes to buy pow stuff. He put it on his car window.
B00JXS3BXI|5|Great winch. Great quality. Great price. I'd definitely buy it again if I had t. But. It's so sturdy I don't see that happening. Thanks smittybilt. Al a us make great stuff. Easy to install. No complaints.
B002UBZMGY|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00U86A254|5|I will defnitely make use of this supplier again. Fast delivery and good quality.<br />Thank you
B000BUU5XQ|5|Great price.  They are light and easy to store.
B000BW8NGA|5|Fit first time, exact lengths and nice, positive &#34;pop&#34; when it's seated against the plug.
B00KAVGUFS|2|Not very impressed.  Can only hold a conversation at or below 40 mph,  We have full faced HJC helmets.  Should be better, very dissappointed.
B000RNU4BA|5|The hitch was very easy to install.  It is a 2 person job.  Looks good and fit almost perfect.  Did have to smack it with a hammer a couple of times,
B0001WW37U|5|Love it. Fits in my 2009 Nissan Altima Sedan nicely.
B00029XI2Q|2|lasted about a month then stopped sounding
B00IDSIBLG|2|Have had these for a while but Lens turned yellow and LEDs happen to shoot out a purple color instead of it's original color but other then that they work good and do it's job when brand new
B002308E9O|5|the tool worked great for the price I paid. it saved me around 100 dollars in repairs., because I would of had to take it to a guy that works on bikes. who would not let me use his tool. what a prick.
B00DVRY03M|5|fast delivery . exact match
B005CW9MN2|5|good quality product!
B00BD5GSWA|5|I Love this package set for my car! It looks great and fits perfectly. I was so excited to get it when it finally came and had to install it immediately. Thank you very much for great customer service.
B000WJF7FC|3|The only thing I would change regarding this Lock/Alarm would be its sensitivity. It has to be disturbed pretty well before it goes off.  Maybe that's the way it should be . I'm not sure.
B00ZCE2Z5W|3|Nice lights. Easy set up. Nice kit. Only issue is the remote only works from like a foot away from the sensor which is annoying....
B002O6WACO|5|This was a replacement lens for my RV. It fit perfect and arrived on time. Thank you.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great.  I use it with the Torque android app (definitely spend the couple bucks or whatever it is for the full version).  Unless you're a professional mechanic, I don't see any reason to spend several times as much on a dedicated code reader.
B00DJ5KEEA|5|Better than a trickle charger plus you can leave it connected. Ideal for vehicles that are not used often or for vehicles left in a garage for several months.
B000X9EGFS|5|So far, so good.  Only have had it a couple of days.  It aired up the tires ok
B000C9RN2C|5|Just as advertised after tax I couldn't find a store in town with a better price than this
B0035UDD4M|5|Nice Ride when installed on my Ultra Classic.
B0087FK172|5|These flairs fit like a glove. I bought them to hide rust . I ground the rust then treated it and used a little fine hair fiberglass to feather out . Then I outlined where the flair would be with a grease pencil taped it off and coated it in undercoating for pertection under the flairs . Now for some wider times and tires
B005D1HXN8|5|Had my local Toyota dealership instal these while they had my 2014 FJ in for it's 6 month check-up. I had them also install some other things at the same time. They look just great and I think they will hold up a bit better than the stock door sill protectors.
B00GGMKNEY|5|Good quality good fit
B004YWPMN0|5|High Performance Canbus with Anti-Flicker is great if you are having problems with any of the other ballasts. My problem was that one hid light would turn on before the other (it would take like 3 or 4 mins). After I got the anti flicker they work effortlessly with giving light in an instant.
B00CZBQCR2|5|Good
B005EEPTSK|5|Great fit.
B00A2VHM1W|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised.
B00M77ZXRY|3|good
B00K9TDDLK|1|Sticker not as pictured.  It is white with a printed yellow background.  Customer service, however, is excellent and prompt.
B009B9GYBU|5|Works great, perfect size and shipper was fast.
B0039234WM|2|I was sent two 24&#34; blades instead of a 24&#34; and 20&#34;....had to re-order 20&#34; separately, which ended up being the Bosch 20OE and did not fit. now I have to find another replacement.  The 24&#34; blade works perfectly, so i kept the extra for future use.
B0054RM32M|5|Definitely recommend this product Good Quality
B0002SR7TC|5|Easy to use--works as advertised-- saving me a lot of time on oil changes.
B00XV7H0HA|5|Looks great!
B005R6R6DG|5|This is a good product.  Use it in the tank of our trailer at the deer lease.  Sometimes it is 2 to 3 months between visits to the lease.  Weekly during deer season.  This does an excellent job of odor control and have had no tank problems since we started using it.  Much cheaper from Amazon than at the hardware store.
B00INA090U|5|I so like having these and have purchased several
B000WEMJQ2|5|Perfect fit, very satisfied
B00DLMKHVG|1|One side went out in 3weeks later sucks. .
B002CCLFUI|1|This item says it is a 50 amp lock but that end is a 30 amp and will not work on our RV.....the packaging and the description is wrong.
B006R34PB4|5|Installed in trailer that gets lots of vibrations.  Regular bulbs couldn't take the vibes.  These are working fine so far.
B00U5IQSDU|1|Threw away my money buying this. So thin it was impossible to apply to the car. Get a better quality item instead of this.
B0002SRJDG|5|will last
B00BITJZ6M|3|You get what you paid on this one.  The OEM handle costs 3 tonnes as much.  I decided to buy this for my old truck and I didn't expect it to be OEM quality.  It works but it feels light and plastic-ey.
B005G57ZT8|5|Excellent quality.  My bike runs after I put in, what else should I say? Where can I get the air filter cleaner?
B000FCGUAM|5|I got this to hook my rather huge bird feeder to another bungee cord around a high tree limb.  It's better than chain and easy to take it off and on to fill.  The locks are good.
B00JIIZCM6|5|This is great!  I use this for my very expensive leather sofa and my purses.  If you use this regularly on your sofa, it really enriches the color.  For purses, I found that I was able to get pen, ink, and other stains off.  Of course, you'll need to put a little effort into getting those stains out...like seriously rubbing it on your purse.  I've purchased this once before and will likely continue to purchase this brand.
B000W7RI56|5|it looks beautiful and works well.
B00VB4FC0C|5|Great price, fast shipping and perfect for our commercial wright lawn mowers!
B004I169KM|5|JUST AS DESCRIBED  FAST SHIPMENT
B00892ABSM|5|ok
B00IW33UPO|1|I installed this, but removed it right away. I bought the C&C Car Worx version instead.<br /><br />This mounting plate is flimsy, held with only two screws with foam/rubber spacer between it and front of the car. The bottom part of the mounting plate is just hanging there.
B008XLGQOM|5|Good quality product for the price that I paid for it
B004GCKPHG|4|It was perfect cannot tell it is a replacement
B00EFFWR3E|1|We will not be buying this for marking lumber or logs its spray is too wide and messy. Touch n Tone all the way
B00M09WKYI|3|Product line runs smaller than usual and is not stretchy at all.
B004N46LNY|5|Great product
B006VTRTS0|5|They look awesome on my 2009 Precision Gray Nissan Maxima. I carried them to my local auto service repair station, and they had them on in about 20min's .
B000C8NV2Y|5|They have a Great build quality, feel real sturdy, not flimsy or anything. For my application at least, it was a truly direct-fit, no slop or gaps, or anything.
B005DX7JE4|5|Perfect
B001B5F2JC|5|Flywheel is good quality!
B00I7ELD02|5|Works good.
B006LJBP4E|2|Not identical Town Car 2004 and modified in order to be valid given two-star quality ..
B000J1SQWO|5|It's light enough to carry around without breaking my back, but provides the safety net I need to protect my most valuable asset (my employees).
B002KG267W|5|Excellent
B00HN3A1JC|1|1 long piece was bad having no luck getting one back looks like they would stand by product.
B00J0ABS5M|4|does the job it is made for .
B005VPS2TU|5|Fit right in exactly. No problems to report.
B0017OGA70|5|Great for for my husband's HD 2003 Heritage Soft tail.
B00JIARQ1O|5|Replaced the antenna in my 2002 Toyota 4Runner SR5. No problems.
B004UVGEJQ|1|this item is advertised incorrectly I wanted the new formula, this had same item number as new formula but not new formula
B002A2L5K0|5|Perfect key chain for Mustang lover!
B00DJBQ1SW|5|I bought these ramps because the of flat plate so that I can use my hand truck up and down steps at home.<br />They are well made and finished off nice and I did not find any sharp edges or burrs like some reviewers have, although the cotter pins did stick out and needed to be redone.
B000XETMW0|5|Works as advertised. Cleaned with this tool rusted threads for O2 sensors. Make sure you apply anti seize compound designed for O2 sensors or spark plugs
B007LIB6AW|5|fits perfect and looks great as promises.  It does have a strong odor as indicated by a few reviews I saw.  It has the new car smell from the rubber and I am assuming the protective sealant that may be on it.  But I did not find it offensive and like all things new, it will disappear in time.  installation went as predicted.  It is best to put these things on when the temperature is above 80 and also leave the new cover in the vehicle for about an hour prior to installation.  It slips right on.  Today the weather was about 65 yo 70.  Putting it on took about 5 minutes and patients.<br />About the only thing I can see that could be criticized was the packaging.  The box was entirely too big for the product and a basic waste of space for the driver delivering the package.  It was in a huge box 25 times larger than the item and had a scrap of paper put in like it was gonna protect it.  It would have been simpler and more efficient to place it in a sleeve type box and ship.  I am attaching a photo of the package to show.  Also who ever put it in the box looked like a 12 year did it.  Poor taping job.  The over sized, mostly empty box looked damaged and would appear that what every may be in the box would be trashed had it not just been a steering wheel cover.  I am giving a 5 star rating.  I got what I asked for.  I received it quickly and Fed Ex did an outstanding job.  Whoever packs your items though, lacks skill.
B00O2XJ0PW|5|Excellent key chain. Great quality, great functionality. Love the assortment of colors available. The red/orange color is beautiful. Very pleased!
B00T564EIY|5|I received my new KR1100, 1100 Watt inverter today and have been testing it; so far so good.  At the moment I have it running both a 100W light bulb and 26&#34; LCD TV while attached to a deep cycle battery.  It is showing a wattage draw of around 250 Watts, well below its rated capacity, but a test just the same.  I was a bit alarmed when I put a multimeter across the AC receptacle and only read 94 vac, so I sent a question about it via Amazon to TechBuy where the unit shipped from.  BTW, it got here the second day after being ordered.  Within no more that two minutes after clicking send I received a phone call from TechBuy to discuss my concern.  Seriously, it was LESS THAN TWO MINUTES!!  That's what I call fantastic customer service and I was in the customer service business for 35 years!!  When they asked me if I was using a True RMS multimeter I knew immediately that something I was wondering was correct--I was not getting a real RMS reading.  Anyway, the TechBuy person gave me a couple of quick tests to perform, like comparing the light output of a incandescent bulb and if the TV works okay, the unit was putting out what it is supposed to.  It passes both tests with flying colors!  I will update this down the road after I get it installed in our travel trailer and get some realtime use on it.  But for the apparent quality of the build, all the extras it came with and most of all the awesome customer service I give it five stars at this time. 8/26/2015 UPDATE:  I installed this in our travel trailer and it works great.  Here is a picture of it putting out 978 Watts without problem while driving the microwave in the TT.  MY 5-STAR RATING REMAINS VALID.  About to leave on a one month tour and will be using it quite frequently.  I will update this review again after I return. 10/7/2015:  We did use this a little bit during our month-long, 6,000+ mile RV trip out west and it performed flawlessly.
B00W8DBZQU|5|Found to be of high quality and fit my Renegade very well.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and yea, I would recommend them.
B00407TWPI|5|Matches the silver honda accord 1999. But its for scratches and small areas, you can't use it for larger portion such as door etc
B004GIVDTY|5|I have an old 2000 outback, just the driver window was going out. Swapped out switches in 15mins with this one. Worked perfect and added an extra Auto roll down feature with the passenger side window. Thanks.
B00C6PS4XC|5|Good quality graphics. Fast shipping. Very pleased
B00SZJLP8Y|5|What can I say
B00MB0E1ZC|5|We live in the Southwest so a steering wheel cover is a necessity here. My daughter has somewhat small hands, so in addition to preventing them from burning after her car has been sitting in the school parking lot for hours, it provides a nice, comfortable grip for her.
B00L2RX4CG|5|Applied to wall easily.
B0009N30EQ|5|Works great and doesn't interfere with my glass clip.
B003YMVOWO|4|Just what I needed on our 2002 Ford Taurus, no more shaking while braking.
B00AQZB9FO|5|Great ! ! !
B00OS436QE|5|Fun buy to spice up your ride.
B0073WEZU4|1|The threads needed to be cleaned thoroughly with a file to make them fit with my truck. The antenna is not attached to the threads so the antenna comes off leaving the threads stuck in the vehicle. I lost a lot of signal. After about an hour to get the threads out of my truck I now have my factory antenna back in.
B005C58S52|5|Fit is perfect, easy to install !
B007S1BGW0|5|High quality, long-lasting marine grade bearings and everything grease
B0042KJV9U|5|Sark City
B0057FJXVA|5|I was very please with my purchase, the replacement cooling fan assembly(pt# TCY 622400) was the correct part for my vehicle's needs. After having installed it at the beginning of the summer, it has provided the proper air circulation necessary to keep my AC unit in top form. The installation  of the new unit was fairly easy and pretty straight forward. The only minor issue, given it was an aftermarket part, there were/are no holes at the bottom of the unit to secure the OEM hose mount clips(but zip ties work fine). I purchased the item on Amazon through a the secondary vendor Midway Auto Supply and was very pleased with their service. They offered timely shipping, a nice price, were very helpful in confirming that this was the right unit for my needs, and provide solid communication(w/tracking info).  Don't think you can ask for more than that, and yes should the need arise again...I would not hesitate.
B000IYZGI4|3|Something I think everyone should know if your using ACDelco parts. Throw away every paper gasket they ship with the parts. Go buy Felpro Gaskets separately. ACDelco is not in the gasket making business and if they are using an independent supplier they need to fire them and team up with Felpro Gasket Company. The paper gasket cost me a 2nd tear down because it failed. GM didn't even use a paper gasket when they put the water pump in from the factory. GM and Felpro's are a type of thin metal that's coated with a gasket material. They Work!! Just fair warning if your going to take on replacing a water pump in your Duramax. Watch youtube videos, search and read forums so you can learn the little tricks before you take the job on. Other than the gasket issue the water pump is good. PS. Buy the Lisle 22100 tool work smarter not harder it's worth it.
B000HTNPLU|5|I received AC flush on scheduled time, pretty straight forward it's A/C Flush worked great.
B009VQZFL8|2|I purchased these mirrors because I thought they would give my car a nice look, and who doesn't want turn signals on their mirrors right?  I contacted the seller and asked what I had to do in order for these to work on my car, which is a 2004 Infiniti G35 coupe, and I was told that all I needed to do was tap into my turn signals......sounds easy right?  I spoke to three different shops and found no one willing to make those modifications on my car, and since I had no experience with that type of work I decided just to install the mirrors and forgo the signals.  To my dismay, when I removed my stock mirrors, and went to install these mirrors, the screw alignment is completely different.  These mirrors DO NOT fit the 2004 Infiniti G35 coupe.  I ended up having to sell these mirrors just to get my money back.
B00FS9TWGG|5|Nice
B002J858HQ|4|Great product, but doesn't last very long.
B00P1N8QU2|5|Very nice.
B00DQVWZGW|5|Higher quality than I expected, had it for a month looks really good! Hope it lasts long!!!
B00FFL97UI|5|Had to replace both rear 6&#34; oval grommets on the boat trailer. They look good. Perfect fit.
B00YEEI5WS|2|did not fit my Nissan Pathfinder SUV. It is not universal. Tried to make some modifications, no dice. i tried various setups, and finally trashed it.
B00DTEBXSC|4|Nice product
B0092ZWDNG|5|Very well made. Fits very well. Makes a bit difference on heat accumulation. Well worth the investment.
B00NSG5BKC|4|It actually arrived 3 days after placing the order! The 1 thing is it didn't come with instructions but easy to look it up. Runs great!
B000C19DNM|3|Four stars on the product. Two stars on the directions. Three overall. I love the functionality of this product and it's been working flawlessly. No more worries about forgetting to lock the tailgate when I walk away from my truck!  But the instructions!  It was an absolute fiasco trying to find the wires to tie into for the power locks. The crappy one page installation instructions had the wrong wire color codes for 2008 ford and had me looking for two wires that weren't there, and looking in the wrong place. Finally through sheer luck I located the right two wires which are actually pink with black stripe and red with orange stripe like the 07 wiring code says. These also run back the channel under the door carpet trim even in a super cab ( not super crew) truck. Once installed it's great though
B00ARJPGJE|5|Didn't use because only one was in package.  Should have read further description, but it was exactly as advertised.
B009OBW29S|4|Works very well on my black Infiniti, regardless of what others may be saying, the shine and covering of road rash is outstanding.  No, its not paint, but it shades the speckling on the front bumper and hood very well and it doesn't cost much - try it.....
B001KSE0XO|3|There was not enough double sided tape to securely attach the glass.  It was easy to install.
B00CSBR6SI|5|Was as advertised. Arrived on time. Works great.
B010805Y70|5|Its Perfect to my  Corolla !'
B00MXBIC6I|5|Cheap and perfect for what we needed
B005EMOPVY|1|stripped as soon as it was installed. plastic is very soft, not suitable for a door handle!
B00LE4HXDS|5|Exactly what it said it was.
B003YI421I|5|works great so far a glued washers to metal and connected rear window seal ends
B00ED9P1RQ|5|WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
B000C81Z72|5|It turns out that I actually didn't need this part after all. But, I installed it anyway, while I had the alternator apart. Put everything back together and everything is working fine. Highly recommended part!
B000KI7DZM|5|Best leather conditioner I have ever found ...works on dried out leather as well
B00902FVNU|5|Worked fine.
B003A3AVGW|5|worked great and it was chrome
B00199NPNU|5|Quality parts at a great price. Quick shipping, on-time delivery as promised.
B005H13BR6|5|Easy to install, looks exactly the same as stock mirror, wiring was actually tidier than the original mirror, and a great price! It's costing more to get the cover paint matched than the whole mirror itself. I installed this on a 2012 i Sport sedan, didn't have any issues with range of motion, seemed the same to me. If someone hits this mirror while i'm parked again, I'll know where I'll be getting another.
B009Q76TVW|5|These are a must-have for any truck that goes offroad.  Keeps all the dirt and road grime out of the bleeders.
B002OUZK7W|5|Great ! ! !
B00CKINFKC|1|The mirrors I bought were convex as these claim to be, but the replacement I purchased is flat (it is slightly convex, but it will never fit). They are the correct part # according to the fitment guide.
B001FJ1OYG|4|Fit perfect, no issues installing it.
B008P5Z68I|5|I've had to buy a couple of these when the radio was left on during a car wash...  Easy to replace, perfect OEM fitment.
B00HVI8R1S|5|very satisfied w/ product and service. Thank you.------Dick
B00GHT8NM0|5|Works great and a lot less expensive than other places.
B0000AZ3Q4|5|Exact fit for my boat but not an easy job to replace on my boat. I elected to just use the cap for now.
B001VLK0RA|1|Used it 3-4 times and now has a leak at the outlet meets the housing
B00A4G4NXA|4|It will serve its purpose ... not as spiffy as I thought it would be
B00EDDPS20|5|Not oe but it works
B00DSJX1BA|5|Fits my 2004 Jetta perfectly, no slop or looseness.  Way cheaper than VW Brand
B0006JLW5M|5|easy to install
B008F91ME6|5|great lights overall,easy to assemble and take on and off the boat when needed. worth $30 i paid
B00342XWVK|5|great product
B00AX6CVSA|4|Generally speaking the front mats I bought are very good quality.  They were a little thinner than I expected.  On these particular mats the attachment to mate with the vehicle's stock floor 'pegs' were somewhat bogus, so I didn't use them.  The fit for my specific vehicle was excellent!!
B006A49J02|5|Great OEM replacement oil for our Ecodiesel. The Prime price along with the instant discount coupon are unbeatable. Not to mention finding this stuff in stores seems all but impossible. If you have an ED RAM or Jeep, you shouldn't be disappointed!
B00EHKMGTM|1|This item shows a crush sleeve but there isn't one in the kit. Found out after tearing down the diff. Huge disappointment.
B00480J4JG|1|This bulb exploded causing me to have to replace the headlight assembly at a cost of $685.  Do not put HID lights in your car!
B00J62YMPW|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B0001YIUZC|4|It does what it says. I wish it had a &#34;dust&#34; or &#34;spider&#34; cover to keep bugs from nesting in it as it is outdoors under the patio cover. But I'm going to put a plastic bag over it.
B000EDUTR2|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00469FOL6|5|Does what it says it does. Smells good and goes a long way. Price ok for a product this good! My old car has a shine and beads water very well.
B0009IBJAS|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B000XG8Q0W|4|My daughter turned me onto these, they are great.  They work for more than just hanging purses or garbage bags.  I used them in our Trooper to hang a net to keep the dog in the back seat. Well pretty much.
B001TAJXXA|5|Headlight assemblies arrived exactly like those in the picture.  Staff at Headlights Depot were very friendly and helpful.  They even offered to send pictures of the actual headlight assemblies they were shipping me, before they left the warehouse.  Once the set of headlight assemblies arrived, it took about 10 minutes to install each side. It is a simple remove the old and replace with the new process.  I would've preferred a 3 year warranty rather than the 1 year.  They look great.
B00ILKAHKE|5|If you're thinking about using a red one as an aux brake light for your motorcycle or trailer, don't.  Too bright for that.  You will literally cause night-blindness in the driver behind you.  I'm using it for that purpose, but I covered the middle 50% of the lens with opaque conspicuity tape so that there is only a thin strip of light escaping around the perimeter.  Perfect.
B000RN04RO|5|Good Size. Works well. So far so good!
B00LCFOIVE|5|Love them so much. They changed the look of my car completely. Seem to be very sturdy! Would buy them again if anything happened to them!
B000HTNODE|4|this is the best way to check coolant, works fine.
B00YD2PWKE|5|Awesome design.
B0076YE4QO|3|eh...they work.  worth the money as long as you don't consider them a permanent fixture.  WILL leak in rain.
B001Q8DMA0|5|Even though the threads get caught on emblems and come loose, this is a great drying towel.  Bought 3 of these so far all of which are still in use!
B00HZ870GM|4|Anyone considering the Superchips Flashpaq 2842 should be aware that the various tunes possible are not available on all vehicles.  Not all vendors make this clear.  I purchased this for my 2007 Chevy Monte Carlo SS, and the only canned tune available for it is the 91 Octane Performance Tune.  Other parameters than can be adjusted for this vehicle include the speed limiter, shift points, shift pressure, and Displacement on Demand/Active Fuel Management (DoD).  Once I recieved it and updated it through Superchips (easy instructions included) I hooked it up to my ride and deactivated DoD and increased the transmission shift pressure by 6 PSI in all gears.  The vehicle ran perfectly on all 8 cylinders all the time and the transmission shifts were noticably firmer, but just barely.  After this limited test I went for broke.  I loaded the 91 Octane Performance tune, kept DoD disabled, and dialed the transmission shift pressure up 20 PSI in all gears, the max allowable with this tuner.  Superchips claims a 14.9 HP increase, and to my &#34;seat-of-the-pants dyno&#34; this feels about accurate.  Felt noticably but not spectacularly faster down the freeway on-ramp, and feels much more responsive in all situations.  Set at stock pressures transmission shifts were soft and lazy at part throttle, and harder but not by much at wide-open-throttle.  With the 20 PSI of additional pressure the tuner dialed in shifts were much more assertive, but remained a bit soft for an alleged sporting machine.  Still, far better than stock.  My fuel economy suffered with both the 91 Octane Performance tune, and the DOD deactivation.  Running the 91 Octane tune with DOD off dropped the fuel economy 2-3 mpg in mixed driving according to the monitor in my gauge cluster.  Deactivating DOD only without the performance tune produced a drop of about 1 mpg in mixed driving.  Bottom line, I'm happy enough with the product.  I purchased it primarily to deactivate DOD and firm up how the transmission shifts.  Mission accomplished on both counts.  While device alone will not turn your street machine into a race-ready monster, it will help you create a more engaging and enjoyable driving experience.
B00A6ZSKVK|2|Does not have the lip for clipping it on to your car window or door panel. This product needs something to hold it in place (cup holder etc)  if it is to be used in a car.
B000CC99K8|5|This gauge was exactly what we were looking for. Installed easily and works perfect.
B000C803Y8|5|Seems to work fine. Good value.
B000VJPVJK|5|I've been using this product for a couple of years. It easily dissolves old lube and flushes out dirt. Also great for cleaning wheel rims of grease. Use it on my Ninja 1000 x-ring chain.
B00BY0J8YY|5|Great pants!  Haven't worn them with the liner yet, but ive worn them over shorts on a road trip and over my scrubs when I ride to work and they have been really comfortable in all regards. I'm 5'4&#34; and 135 lbs, and I got a medium. They fit great as an overpant with a belt and that's what I wanted them for. Would highly  recommend, and of course amazon is great.
B00GKMWD1Q|5|Satisfied customer
B00ICEZSMG|4|Seems to work, bike sounds nicer and power is better off the line.  So far so good.
B00366UBMC|5|Part of a refresh of my 98 Civic EX.  Everything you need in one kit.  Highly recommended.
B00BERR4C0|2|This product was stated to fit a 2001 Ford Escape XLT passenger mirror. Either I am not doing this correctly or it does NOT fit. I'm having to duct tape it just to keep it on.
B002N35W1E|5|We bought this rack so we can carry our kayaks (12ft and 14ft) on a rental SUV. Since we knew the car rental company offers Ford Edge we decided to try it.<br />It fits  the Ford Edge very well, but it is suitable for any SUV of the same width that has elevated side rails. Installation and removal is very easy. Carried our kayaks for the 400 miles trip at highway speeds (above 65mph) with no problem.
B000BQR100|4|Does what it says. Large size fit my Sentra perfectly.
B00G620ZVU|5|Love them
B000SKV4T8|5|Now I can say I use Mobil One in all of my toys even my lawn equipment!!!!
B004BTKVAA|5|As always nice quality and fast delivery. Very well priced
B00EDORMWI|5|They are as bright as can be.
B000FDSW1G|5|Be still, my heart!<br /><br />This beautiful Dodge was one very serious Chrysler.  It was 8 cylinders of perfection and this book will walk you through the features, care and preservation of this mighty fine Dodge.  If you love classic cars, you will love the Dodge featured in this book.  The Coronet was a damn good Dodge.
B004C63F5A|5|Fits like it should in my 2014 Tacoma 2.7L.<br /> A Wix air filter did not fit the air box correctly, making it difficult to close the lid.
B00EO4W49S|1|Did not receive the grill that it says it is, although I do like the one I got much more than the one I was expecting. It fit perfectly but it I would not recommend ordering this.
B003UWEE5W|5|This KICK ASS CHAIN & LOCK are the BOLLOCKS.<br />The YouTube videos on this product says it all. No thief is going to cut this chain or lock with bolt cutters.<br />Hence the phrase, FORGETABOUTIT.<br />This may be overkill for some bikes, but remember this. Thieves are cutting through bike lock cables in the time it takes to read this paragraph with side cutters(pliers).<br />They cannot cut either this chain or lock unless they are using a die grinder.<br />You know how much noise that makes?<br />Believe me, they would just as soon move onto some other bike than have to tackle this monster.
B0007Y4P9G|5|Exact match for the original covers on my 1996 Jayco popup camper, and very easy to install.  Not much else to say...they were genuine parts that fit as designed.
B006VYHR46|2|It's very flimsy plastic. Wish it was little softer and heavier plastic. Feels like a cardboard. Only plus point is it fits nice. Hoping it will Atleast last for few year.
B008J5H6I2|5|This blanket works!  I can now sleep!  The A/C unit is right outside our bedroom and our new unit is louder than the old one.  This really takes the noise level down.
B009GXMAL4|3|pricey but good quality and fit.
B00RJX16WM|1|Very flimsy and strong plastic smell. If it hadn't come from China, I would return it.
B004JVHWO8|5|great price, works as described, fast shipping
B004SUO5QS|5|These speakers are the real deal!  They're inexpensive, bolt right in, wires plug in with no modifications, AND they sound great.  I was a little unimpressed with how they were packaged, but, they showed up free of damage, and didn't have any styrofoam to mess with.  All in all, money well spent for sure,
B00GSAUHB8|5|Happy
B000GU5IH4|5|Perfect fit for my GSXR600!
B00NRVDM7C|4|Just installed them yesterday. I dont know how I lived without HIDs! Took a little bit of modifying. Had to cut my dust boots open a bit to fit everything past but after that they fit in perfectly and truly was plug and play!
B000COCTXA|5|Well the parts were brand new and the price was great, but the hole where the fluid sprays out is positioned to low. It only sprays on the bottom of my windsheild and fluid runs down my hood. Manufacturing defect.
B007WMF7E8|5|The same gasket as the old one! not much to say. It fit perfectly no hassle.
B009LAV086|5|Great product. Very easy to change from one ball to another.  Very good quality.
B008RAFQ2M|5|Torqued to spec and no leaks. Definitely a quality gasket.
B000C5G5G6|5|husband was very pleased with his purchase.
B000COC0GQ|5|ATTENTION!!!!!<br /><br />The product is amazing and it fits perfectly in our 2015 Subaru Outback and 2014 Subaru Impreza Sport. The model number is correct but Amazon shipped the wrong filter with the correct item number on it. I returned it and reordered the filters, and received the correct filter.
B000BPOI8O|4|ok
B00D2PLR0C|5|Great product!!
B00H9Z3FVU|5|I bought two of these transformers and they worked like a charm.  I used one to power a HP Laserjet 680 printer, and during the field they recharged radio batteries, cell phones, and a coffee maker. These bad boys endured many days and nights being plugged into a generator and sometimes in hardstand buildings all the time providing a reliable source of a 110 or 220 current.  This handy doo-da ended being a lifesaver and withstood a 90 days of field time = (being moved around ALOT, constant use, some moisture) and still continues to deliver. Although we used it constantly, we also treated this thing with kit gloves since it was so valuable to us. Bottom line this transformer is reliable, durable, and worth every penny.
B001QIUGVI|5|This scanner has paid for itself the 2nd time I used it. The abs codes are easy to read. It also tells you air bag info as well. And traditional engine codes as well. Comes with a case and instructions. Can do live data on most sensors on the motor. Upgradable through the Internet. Works good. As described.
B000EVYGZA|5|great product
B00WAW9ITU|5|Very sturdy .not like the last ones I tried
B002N3TSUK|4|These did not fit my 2015 Golf Sportwagen.  The adjustment screw/bolt would've made contact with the rooftop damaged the paint.  Quality was respectable though.
B000WJ8HEK|5|Looks good on bike
B004BH9U3Q|5|I don't know why anyone would give this item less than 5 stars.  As promised from the fit guide, the shield fits my Lincoln MKX perfectly. I can put it in the dash without even using my sun visors actually, and it would stay all day.  The material is good quality, not flimsy, and keeps my car SO much cooler.  I live in Florida and it really heats up in the summer months.  I am SO glad I found this sunshade!
B007H2QYHM|5|works for power jacks as well
B00KTD8F3C|5|Very cute! I have a Cavachon, and, though this decal is of a Bichon, it resembles a Cavachon close enough.  Now I want one with a German Shepherd!
B00GB8614E|4|Very nice
B00JXOJ5VO|5|Just as listed, hooked into door and they look nice. Work great
B00A8MZ2ZS|3|Towels are okay
B001BNCM8I|4|Not quite big enough to fill the floorboard of an F-150, but looks good on top of the regular carpeted mats.  These would work well in a car or small truck.  Overall look was good though and made the husband happy!
B000C3XD90|5|Bad product does not hold up, it leaks oil 1/2 way before the next oil change due, waste of money and time🍋
B00T54J4AE|1|Not compatible with my truck
B000GV95G8|4|Fit well easy installation
B0009OMYDS|2|too stiff /  end of bristles look melted over
B003RV48ES|5|Work good
B000VNAIQ2|1|Cleaned glass with acetone, cleaned metal button also. Was careful not to touch any part that was to be glued. Applied the activator and let sit for 5 minutes as directions said. Applied a drop or two of the glue, held it in place for a minute and then taped it in place all night long (10 hours). Went to see how strong it was and it popped off. I'm not sure what else to try, did everything as the directions said.
B0016IGZ18|4|great price for oem parts
B003ZW1ZUO|5|Exactly as described. Quick ship.
B0068OKJLW|5|Great for my leather sofa where our dog has scuffed it up.  Just rub a lot as the instructions direct so no residue comes off on clothing.  Made the sofa look new and lasted several months.
B001XTUVCO|4|They messed up the shipping and sent it to Minisota or something so after a reroute it took over a month to receive the hood. Once here the box was thrashed, but to my surprise the hood was in 100% condition still so kudos on them for packing it so well.  The mounting bolts are slightly off (front to back) but not a big deal minor adjustments made it right. Looks great and fits reasonably well, so overall I like it a lot. If not for shipping and the minor modification I had to do it I would have given a 5/5
B00K2QKOHG|5|love it
B000C2SJLS|5|I replaced the belt myself and drove 30k miles before selling the car without having a single issue.
B000CQDPIQ|5|Love these. Made a HUGE difference on gas mileage on a 2400 mile trip this summer. I would definitely recommend them to anyone with a MANUAL TRANSFER CASE 4x4 R50 Nissan Pathfinder. This wont work with the automatic electronic &#34;shift on the fly&#34; 4x4. Causes error lights and low oil conditions/overheating in the transfer case on long drives
B000GKSNGC|3|Really liked this at first. Easy to use, quality seem pretty good. Don't know if its the temperature in the garage this summer but recently a lot of grease has leaked out of the bottom where the suction handle is.
B003CR2ILM|5|I love it went on easy and sounds great, maybe the gas mileage will improve when I start keeping my foot out of it.
B00Y9IAE00|5|Perfect fit, easy to assemble. One happy lady!
B000BGJX88|5|Perfect for my pop-up camper.
B000C5DXUC|5|Great price!
B0061T5RZ2|5|Love it glad to see colored decal
B00IT9MBV0|5|Received earlier than expected. Quality piece. Good price. Recommended! A++++
B00FKWAJJA|5|Great qualityerfect enduro belt pack
B006ZOXWZU|3|Loud as a bag of potato chips.<br /><br />Super watertight. Great camo pattern. Don't plan on hunting in these things.<br /><br />I washed them twice and did everything I could to soften them up, but wearing these makes you sound like a pack of drunk buffalo walking through the woods.<br /><br />Great product for situations that don't require stealth.
B0068C7066|5|Great windshield . Directions leave a lot to be desired. Use common sense and trial and error and everything will work out
B000E28N9Y|5|Fit great and my bike is running just fine. However, I wish I would have know that this does not come with o-rings.
B00OFHL7W4|2|the left hand thumb stitching rests exactly where the throttle rubs it, causing irritation and blistering. the ventilation is barely adequate.
B00KXNR548|5|Nice product for the price.
B002NIKTAI|5|Love it
B00DZUDCFC|3|Just got these in the mail and I am a bit disappointed already. They came out of the box with dents and scratches like they were dropped before being put in the box. Some of the dent had already shown some signs of oxidation. I will update this after I clean them up and install them
B00HV2KMFI|5|Very good price and fast shipping. Also if you need to call for anything they are knowledgeable about their products. If ordering this lift you must order longer u bolts because the factory u bolts are too short and absolutely will not fit.
B001U7JTBS|5|These step covers have held up very well for two years.  We bought a new RV and I am buying three new sets for all the steps.  Very pleased great price.
B00150T13G|3|super strong smelling.. Bubble gum..
B004UBCKYY|5|Love these! I have one in the shop and the other on my key chain. Handy carry accesory.
B001EU59VA|5|Great intake. It was fairly easy to install. Looks great, sounds great and difference in air auction.
B006X98A7C|5|Good price.  Free shipping works for me!  Batteries fit fine and do what they should.
B00N2DK2OG|5|look great. fit is good ,and its been almost 3 weeks and they are still on.
B003121OGS|5|love it
B000EVYGV4|5|Good product
B0079MFD36|4|Yep, the match is perfect! The description says it comes with a detail brush but I received a toothpick instead. So the description isn't completly accurate. But honestly the paint is much less than the dealer's touch up paint so you've saved a bunch right there.<br />5 stars for the paint match!<br />4 stars for receiving different than what the description indicates.
B0036WC7CS|5|Love it
B00945SINS|5|Cheap and fixed my AC blower in minutes.
B00CW7D8R6|4|Good brakes, easy installation<br />Need more time to determine how fast they wear however
B0002JN3FI|4|Wipers fit nicely and easy to install.  Great price and shipped quickly.  Heavy rains are no match.
B000Z0HVHA|5|I'm pleased with the construction and the wire they used to manufacture this extension cord.<br /><br />This is for our camping.
B00C2UB7IK|5|Great product
B0028JN6XE|5|EXCELENT PRODUCT
B0000C6G1C|5|Excellent plug. Had one just like it before but let it go when I traded the truck in.
B00X9R5DTO|4|happy
B008RIEQXY|5|Awesome looks great easy install
B00BAVU0K8|5|How bright are the light's?
B00KV076B0|5|Couldn't be happier with the product, fast shipping, fits perfect, a little tight but it'll fit and took me about 20 mins if not less
B002P8QKAY|5|Perfect OEM look replacement. We have had no problems with it. Great price
B000WJAN6K|5|Top quality wiseco product
B00CIXMEN8|5|Perfect size for my Forester!
B00G66KNZY|5|Excellent
B00B96AKB8|4|I've used this product for many years on my trailers. My new trailer didn't have a door holder, so I bought and installed it. One needs to be careful where and how it is to be installed and the screw length.
B007Q8LVFC|5|Excellent
B000JZN224|5|Using this part saved me about $40. The cruise control cable end on my 98 Transam broke and the only resolution was to replace the whole cable. I saw this cable retainer for $8 and said this may be worth a try. The retainer needed some modifications to fit my application. After enlarging the hole and thinning out the retainer it works like it was designed for my car. The cruise control works like new.
B009ADPL6Q|5|Working very well for me.
B006CRT72W|4|Perfect replacement!
B005IC2SK0|5|perfect fit clips
B000OUUG8M|5|a good bargain ,great selection
B00651C4W0|5|Functions like the OEM antenna and fits under the garage door. I think it looks better too!
B00P68L9RO|5|I use this high-quality, heavy-duty cord to run a large 12-volt fan that cools the two retrievers I carry (in crates) at the back of my GMC Acadia. It works perfectly, and there's no discernible voltage drop. Many years ago, I bought a Radio Shack &#34;equivalent&#34; that was incredibly flimsy and lasted all of two weeks. The BESTEK cord is a Mercedes by comparison—at about the same price! Highly recommended.
B0055XHAOG|2|After about 6 months cover started tearing. Has never been very comfortable. Would not buy again.
B000765MHI|5|My Dog love's it.
B00SLLC5QW|5|worked fine
B00J6ZI8YU|5|loe it 30 min. install thanks
B00AQIL05A|5|Fit perfectly and was very easy to install.
B003TQ2W44|5|Awesome guage.  I am very particular and I have been completely satisfied with this one.
B000BQW5LK|5|Excellent pump. I used it pump transmission fluid for my transfer case as well as 80w-90 gear oil for my front and rear differentials. The pump worked flawlessly on both fluids. Highly recommend, great pump, great price.
B007X4F2G8|4|Fairly sturdy ladder.... A little bit of assembly required and I had one hole without any threading BUT overall works well, especially for the price.
B009DK8DB6|4|Worked as advertised.
B0083LHN7Q|5|I haven't had chance to use them yet but a nice quality
B007HRUTDC|5|Just fine, right price too!
B0083H4SMI|5|5 minute install. Great price!
B003E7QZ4G|5|exact fit and look great
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Perfect.  What I ordered.
B00SBPSL3E|5|have no problems  with these<br />good tool  to have
B00UWGARGE|1|NOT heavy weight! The product is not heavy weight. In fact I can see through the towels. Don't know if I got a bad batch or what. These are also about $15 at the local big box club stores. Where I expect quality control is also better. These also shed fibers HORRIBLY.
B004SS6EMI|1|This car cover lasted only 2 1/2 years before the material thinned and ripped.  It's almost as though the material is disintegrating.  You would think with a 5-year warranty, the product should last at least that long.  Unfortunately, I didn't think to keep the receipt and so I just have to buy another car cover - but this time, not from Budge.
B00WX79TOQ|5|glad I found you my new car looks & feels great
B00HE6CI58|5|Lights up my interior perfectly!! Much better than those stock lights
B009DKF6TI|3|they seem to work fine , no long term testing yet
B006A49J02|5|Very hood product at a nice price
B00MRWNHT0|5|Great bulbs, love the white tone on these bulbs!
B00EDFM5QU|5|We are replacing all of the 12 volt filament light bulbs with LEDs in our RV. These may give slightly less light that the original bulbs, but our RV has ample light fixtures. Other reviewers have mentioned they are difficult to install. I have found that the raised flange/collar at the neck of the bulb is a perfect place to press the bulbs to seat. If you are careful, you can get the index finger of one hand above and the other index finger below to pressure the bulbs into place. Trying to push on the LED disc will almost surely bend the the assembly. I did this trial and error, but even though I slightly distorted the first couple, they bend back into shape and work fine.
B00GYI1YCK|4|just need to fix a little better fix.. but over all it does job
B008BLFHS0|5|worked perfectly.  very professional results.  Thanks.
B000S2U49W|5|Was as advertised. perfect fit shipped fast.
B000C7WWC0|5|fit was excellent  (looked just  like factory original part)<br />price was hard to beat--worked great!!
B0091XT102|5|Looks and works great
B001GXUMNA|5|Exactly what I expected
B00J5SH3VC|5|Fit great, looks great, sounds awesome! Buy it! You won't regret it.
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Spectacular and I liked it a lot. Fits perfectly on my SUV
B00069CN2I|5|Just what we were looking for. Not only were these cheaper than everywhere else we looked but it fit my mirrors like a glove.<br />I drive a 2005 GMC Sierra.
B005CLM59Q|4|Good
B000V5UKQI|2|My typhoon intake was scratched, and one end of the pipe was dented, the bag with all the screws/nuts/bolts was opened with missing components, I have already started the installation when noticing this, took my stock intake, engine cover combo off already. I have pictures of everything and amazon won't respond. Not happy and pretty fed up.
B004SVFOVM|5|Fit is perfect, really dressed my little &#34;Taco&#34; up. Nick in customer service was outstanding.
B000BZMC9Q|3|wrong part, be careful that the picture isn't exactly match the actual part
B00658QHDU|5|super bright, fits in 2015 Honda Fit dome light housing
B00651CC2W|4|Gets pretty bendy in the wind, stays bent for a while after you park it.  I could stand to be a stiffer rubber, but it works well, good reception, and quiet/safe in the car wash.
B0012GYW2I|5|Love the lights!
B0108ZVK14|5|as described, good price
B00MT0NC1S|5|Recipient loves her new decal!
B00C7S0KA8|5|No issues works well
B000FRTYA0|5|Arrived as described and worked perfectly!
B00V5B3PTG|5|love it.
B00HAMW3M4|4|this product I looked a long time to find. unlike the stainless version of this product it fits well. these are made out of a thick urethane that is textured and is very easy to clean. the stainless panels do not fit well and the corners will pull loose after time and sometimes they wont fit the contour of the body and there is nothing you can do to fix it.that is my experience with them
B00SH6FCUW|5|Perfect
B00DPWSEAI|4|Fit and looked good
B002URB7JY|5|Great Product
B004HFDGWS|5|High quality, looks great! I'll have to see how it hold up here in New England this winter?
B000EDUUIA|4|These are lighter weight than expected but they get the job done and are easy to install.
B00FHN4FIS|2|A bit large and unwieldy.
B00A7ER1L0|1|Stainless steel brush fell apart on first use.  I was amazed how easily the bristles came loose.
B003FFF41C|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B009FC8C5Y|5|Great fit and done in 30 mins!,
B0028PJ10K|2|Two of the blocks cracked and are not usable. Not happy with this product
B00CJ0R750|4|This part was so hard to take out to replace.
B000C9324K|5|A plus part and service
B00Y2EWE0Y|5|Works great! Plugged in easily, and reads everything perfectly. It has so much information on it, it's definitely a good tool to have around to make sure your car is working as it should all the time.
B0066TMIK4|5|Hard to go in to detail about a temp sensor, but good price, fit my '74 BMW 2002. What more to say?
B001UCESAA|4|Fit as expected, a little more work than expected but not due to the new part. Hard to get the old one out
B00546C8UA|1|DOES NOT FIT A RAV4, 2013 model!!  Boooooo!!!
B008A92PF6|2|It came off in less than 2 months
B00MGJ4LZS|5|A plus part and service
B00AB4B0L8|5|Perfect and worked great
B001DCEUNW|5|Works as good as OEM, 75% cheaper than all of the auto shops in my area.  Installed on my 2006 Chrysler 300 3.5liter v6
B0017R5EQK|5|This is a great battery tester to have in your tool box.  This tester tells you how many volts the battery is putting out AND it tells you how many cranking amps it is putting out.  When the battery starts to go out, it is the cranking amps that start to diminish first.  I tested the battery in my Jeep and it said 12 volts but it was only reading 400 cranking amps and it was supposed to be at 700 cranking amps.  So, I know the battery was on borrowed time.  Sure enough, 2 months later, the battery went out.
B00KUUAKX2|5|Nice Plate.  Well made.  I couldn't be happier.  It was a great fit for my VW.
B00OLRCKQK|5|Item as described at a great price
B006LIZ3D4|5|Helps greatly to improve night vision
B005G6J3EM|5|easy to apply and its sitting beautifully on my car! Love it!
B00DBEMVMM|5|Plug and play LED's. Looks great, good packaging.<br /><br />NOTE: I installed these on a 2009 Nissan Altima Sedan, and at first put them ALL the way into the crevice where they go. They didn't light up. Turns out you should not put them ALL the way in, but &#34;just about.&#34; So if they're not lighting up, adjust how deep they are in the crevice and you should be good to go.
B004GFS2C8|5|Worked awesome.  Safelite wanted $75 to do this.  This is a bargain and a no brainer.  Great instructions, would buy again.
B00RXVCYOY|5|great plate surround
B009GN2DQQ|2|one of the fans went out within one year, it was barley ran and the fan starts and stops why its counterpart runs just fine. looking at the volts its a steady power supply.
B00JINPJD8|4|Does as it states, like it
B010SHRF2U|5|for some reason these fit very tight at the base,,some what fatter then all the other ones ive bought,,but I got them working
B008EN08WA|5|Very nice decal.  Large size.  Fit perfect on my hood.  Easy install using soap and water method.
B008RIP2FU|5|Item was as expected and worked perfectly.
B003YLKLJM|5|Happy.
B00MEWPAHK|4|did everything it was supposed to
B0052WC3BA|4|Ordering the bilbs was eas . With all the pics they make so convenient to choice the right produc .
B001O7PNW8|5|Puntual
B000CPA8B4|5|Great price ,exactly the right amount for an entire truck bed.Went on evenly..Very pleased..
B002GZCH3K|5|Excellent suspension, direct fit for 1999 Camry (4 or 6 cylinder front left)  Difference for 4 and 6 cylinder is the spring.  6 cylinder strut assembly I believe got thicker diameter spring.  I have a 4 cylinder Camry. Since my bottom front is a little low hitting high humps in our area, I decided to buy this SR4032 (for 6 cylinder).  It lifted my front by half inch or so. Better road handling and I am not hitting the humps anymore.  But if you want a soft bouncy front suspension, buy the 4 cylinder strut (SR4030).
B000CN580W|4|Great Quality Product, when you put this in your xj it has a nice lip or poly that will stick out on each side of the trackbar so it sits really snug in the bracket, the only down side is the hole is not the original m10 size bolt, it is made for a 9/16ths bolt, so you have to drill out your hole a little bigger and go get a grade 8 standard 9/16's bolt and nut. The upside is that if your hole is a little wobbled out you can replace it with this and drill the hole to 9/16's so it should fit perfect, and then you can also torque the bolt down more, the m10 standard bolt you can really only do about 40-45 ft-lbs, but with the bigger bolt I got it at 60 ft-lbs, should help keep that pesky tracbar from having any play and slop. It was a pain in the ass to get the old bushing out of my trac bar even with a balljoint press, but after awhile I got it out and the new one is cake to put in.
B009D35UEQ|4|This is definitely a quality socket. It is thin wall, as stated in the description, and fits into the narrow space of my 2014 Triumph Bonneville T100 just fine. I'm only giving it 4 stars though, because it's quite long and doesn't leave much room on the Bonnie without removing the gas tank. But it DOES work well. If it were 1/2&#34; shorter, it would be perfect.<br /><br />The dimensions given in the product description are the dimensions for the packaging. Dimensions for the actual socket are 4.33&#34; x .94&#34; (110.05mm x 23.87mm). The wall thickness is .102&#34; (2.74mm).<br /><br />Also, the photo on here doesn't do this socket justice. I've included 2 photos so you can see the finish and a view of the end of the socket, showing also the grommet inside.
B000RFSEDI|5|Love this stuff!  With the power of Ozium I can fart in bed without the wife dry heaving. No more flower scented farts from febreeze. This stuff gets rid of that stink instantly. Was delivered quickly.  Just in time for taco night!
B00RGQ1W7Q|5|Great suit. Rained everyday for five days. Ordered another one for a friend when we got home.
B000C9SRD6|5|Finally have a gas tank cap that is attached and will not get lost when getting gas.  Attendants had broken the one that came with my truck.  Love love love it !!!
B004N2KLSW|2|Watch all the videos and they show the lid can simple be snapped off for easy access. That was a selling point for me coming from using an old Engel fridge that has a good systems for a removable lid. After only having it a week the lid is next to impassable to remove and the metal bit where the lid attaches to the fridge stripped out. Plastic is very thin at that point and will require mod to get it to operetta correctly. Time will tell how it holds up to off road use.... This is not a good start. Should have purchased an Engel  :-(
B00X35BYFY|1|No good
B000CITKCE|5|So far so good.  No problems
B00QF0CHAK|5|good
B00065JM8U|2|This fan works okay.  Draws 1.4 - 1.6A on high at 12 volts, which barely challenges my 100-watt solar panel.  But, it is very noisy on high and I have already had to fix it twice!  One of the tiny wires became detached from the base and I had to re-solder.  Then, not even a day later, a wire pulled out of the other end (12V socket end) and I had to re-solder!  And, I don't know if there was a spring inside it that got away from me because the positive end of the cig-lighter plug doesn't make good contact with the back of the socket anymore after fixing.<br />I wouldn't recommend this.  One good thing is that the motor itself seems to be reliable.  I've had it running every day for weeks on end, as long as the sun was shining, from solar power regulated to 12 volts.
B00NX8EYFI|5|love it
B0040AE7WS|2|Looks cheap
B007ZN86X8|1|installed these on my 98 gmc sonoma now every time I hit a bump I hear a loud scraping sound, found that the arms are too wide and they scrape<br />against the truck frame!! called Moog, the Rep said he's fully aware of this problem and suggested that I use a File at the places where it scapes<br />also the turn Radius is much wider now, I feel likee I'm driving a school Bus! Wish now I'd bought Original brand arms from the dealer now!!
B000HBGI8K|4|Good but your instructions are not clear, it seems that would otherwise be used better.
B008AV969C|5|Awesome struts, worth the money, easy install I was told, had them installed when I had engine work done by Roush certified mechanics, look great
B008FWCLHU|5|Great purchase
B001COAL20|1|Wrong coil.
B001DRHMOG|3|Fits my car well, but charcoal doesn't seem to help keep smells out at all.
B00JJQXD64|5|I love this sticker and it looks great on my car.
B007VED1CM|2|Don't over tighten or the top half will split off.<br />Also, they didn't look so hot on my C5.
B00CDQS0Q0|5|Looks like it came from the factory with it on.
B00G6A5ADU|3|not very bright
B00EPA7CZC|4|Bright two out if ten didn't t work
B00PUOQRK8|5|AWESOME product! I leave the gym everyday SOAKED! This seat cover not only works great...but it looks AWESOME in my vehicle (black in a charcoal gray interior)! I was so impressed, I bought a second one for my passenger seat! You won't be disappointed!
B009ERVEV4|2|wasn't what I needed...I didn't need the Metric bracket. I'll use it for something though.
B00480BWCI|5|Very convenient way to level the camper.  Nice carrying case too.  Light and easy to clean when dirty.
B000CITK8S|5|I got tired of replacing batteries almost yearly with my generator.  I was told by the manufacturer that I should only charge the battery once a month for a 24 hours period.  Well who can remember to do that?  Consequently, whenever I actually needed the generator, the battery was dead due to being overcharged or undercharged.  I searched all over for a monthly timer.  I couldn't find one.  I did run across this device and thankfully it works great.  It does everything automatically for you.  If you own a battery start generator, you have to have one of these computerized timers.
B001JSYC1A|1|Doesn't fit any of the The cars, hikes your arm way up high. Useless though made decent.
B007772HG4|5|I LOVE THESE THINGS. I could not live without my &#34;trailer balls&#34;.  Sorry I didn't write a review sooner - I've been too busy enjoying my horse and trailer. So, I have to say that having these literally make the difference between hooking up my trailer alone or not. Actually, I can't even hook it up without them when I have someone trying to guide me. These guys work and I sometimes even get it perfect on the first try. Not always. But normally it takes about 3 minutes to get to the right spot. Without them I'd just give up and go home.
B003CJGOD8|5|good replacement
B00E9CZLF4|5|Kind of silly to put on
B00JA1BU54|5|bolt up as easy as stock manifolds .J used aluminum gaskets n just learned not to touch em .thney get hot as hell quick
B00YG65C52|5|Perfect.
B0024E6YJG|5|Good quality, sturdy, works like it says
B008C0WDAU|5|Can't believe how well this fits the windshield!! It keeps the car 10-20 degrees cooler! Can be a pain to roll up, but worth it!
B004I30A8W|5|Really nice addition to my VW Bug. The seat covers gave it class!
B007PU2L3W|1|It never worked for me. I charge it for hours and it still can work. Waste of money
B004QJ3AYO|5|Worked great!
B00KRJJ30M|4|Solid equipment and easy to install.
B00Y1HT2ZC|4|Great item & it came with it's own programming details which worked easily... &#60;2mins to do...
B002T08SXA|5|I knew my old rear struts were shot and at this price I decided to do all 4. I really liked my 2002 WRX before, but now - WOW! The ride is awesome!
B00830ETRY|1|Use your iPod or MP3 player connected straight to the AUX input.  This unit has some deal breakers for my listening style.  First, the player never stops playing a tune.  Once the key is turned on, track after track after track, even when I'm listening to AM/FM/WB/AUX/XM.  When I go back 5 minutes later, a couple tracks have passed.  Twenty minutes later, 6-8 tracks have passed even though I was off listen to XM or other.  The only time it stops is when the key is turned off.  Next, there is no pause, fast forward, fast reverse.  If you ever skip the first 10 seconds of this song or that, forget it with this unit.  Not possible.  There are no playlists.  Though I filled one of the 5 allowed folders with tunes from my favorite playlist and it worked, kinda.  Tunes are played in alphabetical order.  I was forced to put 01, 02, etc in front of each track title to get the order I wanted.  Next, the wing display only shows the CD (folder) number and track number.  No names, no titles.  Last, I listen with custom molded ear speakers and so I listen with the volume real low, like 2-3.  At that level, I can hear a crackle/hum while listening to tunes or anything else.  Yes, when listening to FM, XM, etc, that crackle/hum is there too.  When I unplugged the digital player, the hum disappeared from everything.  I confirmed with J&M tech support (they were friendly and responsive) that all the above are viewed as &#34;normal&#34; or a function of the features available with the CD player.  Therefore, my recommendation is to pass on purchasing this unit.  The limited functionality of the system is far less than your iPod remote, or just plain MP3 playlists, outright.
B0009Y2CFS|5|While traveling your wife and kids will love these
B004GCRIYY|5|Perfect fit, original replacement mirror for my Element.
B0052SF0LO|5|Really works well and provides a lot of light. Very happy with this unit.
B00P80H9FQ|5|Absolutely loved how sharp it makes my knives with minimal blade disposition, of course dependant on how dull the blade is. I was able to rescue a blade that had a nice Lil nick in it and returned it to razor sharp. The versatility of the three is amazing, the carbide V draws a bunch of metal but it does have its uses. While my prized part of them is the 1/8x1/8x~1/5 inch of tungsten carbide that allows you to hone your blade down straight,  merely the same idea of a steel. Straightening the blades edge. I would definitely recommend this product unbiased and personally.  Especially for a EDC gift for preppers and survivalist being it can also be used for use as a Ferro-Cerrium striker,  tungsten carbide is nearly 4 times stronger than titanium. This will be used for years before it even oxidizes.
B00LML7GJY|1|This failed the first assignment I gave it, which was to charge my GPS navigator because it beeped it was almost out of battery even though I plug it into the car's outlet all the time.  Anyway, the solar charger I had already charged with the USB cord and I had left it outside to get some sun.  Imagine my irritation then when I came back after 3 hours to find not only had this NOT charged my GPS, the GPS was actually lower in battery life!  Epic fail.  I have another portable charger that works a lot better than this.  It doesn't have the solar gimmick, but at least it, you know, actually charges stuff.  Which is pretty much the whole point of it.
B000IYLFUM|4|Works GREAT, but VERY DIFFICULT to install...  Bending the delicate A/C lines to line up with this product is difficult and tedious.  ALSO one recommendation, if you bought this product because of a awful aridic smell coming through your vents, DO NOT use recirculation all the time.  its the recirculation that eventually causes this horrid smell...  Good luck if you have to replace this product, its a LONG process to properly remove it and replace it, it requires the dash of your vehicle to be completely removed, as this part its physically clamped and screwed into the Air Ventilation HVAC part which is a huge all plastic unit behind the dash of a Jeep!!  Word of advise I would advise you to buy the heater core and this part together, because of the difficulty involved in replacing this part its best to replace these 2 units together as the heater core can be EASILY changed when replacing this Evaporator core.  But if you don't replace the heater core and it goes up, OUCH another whole weekend to tear out the dash again :(
B000WJWXNG|5|Came in the mail a day earlier than expected and was installed in less than 30 mins. My bike cruises on the highway doing 75 mph at a nice low rpm. Usually don't come out of 4th unless I'm going faster than 65mph
B0053ZKH96|5|Used to live in Colorado, cant have ronco stickers without the flag.
B00M1OUBES|5|I've been looking for some kind of battery jumper that would fit in my glove box or tool bag and this looked like it would.(and it does) Technology has come a long way since I bought a jump box years ago which was like carrying around a car battery. I buy a lot of used cars that need repairs so they have usually been sitting and the batteries are dead. This little booster is amazing. When you initially take it out of the box charge it up. This is one of the neat things you can charge it with your cars powerpoint or with a usb port on a computer. Once charged it is just a matter of hooking the cables up to the battery, plugging the cables into the booster, pushing the on button, watching the lights and turning the ignition key on the car. It has all the safety features so if you hook it up backwards it lets you know without doing any damage. One thing I learned though if it doesn't sense at least 2 volts when you hook it to your dead battery it won't do anything unless you put it in bypass mode. It tells you that in the instructions but not in the initial hook-up paragragh so don't think it's bad if that happens. I'm going to get a couple more to give as christmas presents.
B00W45MNOU|1|unsure of how to use the product, no instructions
B00SSF25GG|5|I love this quote, but I do believe it may be missing a comma or two.
B00SJTFRFW|2|Would recommend the company change the picture that advertises the guns being able to be mounted from side to side with 2 brace bars, rather than the text saying just mounting front to back. Bad advertisement. Other than that good quality.
B000H8QBCG|5|perfect more that i expected great for the price and had the bulbs and everything installed
B000ZMHNK8|5|Love this stuff.  Made my porcelain shower floor look like new.  It is dark brownish-grey and I was having a terrible problem with hard water marks.  Problem solved, and I have tried a lot of things before this.
B00LWGFWRC|1|I bought this tag light in June and here it Is in August and the light stop working , I will not buy from this seller again it was a complete waste of money.
B001Q24UIY|4|Was pleasantly suprised with the quality  of these for the price. I wasn't expecting much
B000C9SR90|1|was used feel is not safe can smell gas
B003DOR80U|5|This product exceeded my expectations. It produces an aggressive sound with slight HP gains also. It was easy to install and looks nice on the car. Definitely worth the money.
B00J5SZMU6|5|Haven't installed it yet, but the quality seems really good.
B000OUW78O|4|Compressing the springs is kind of unnerving, but these fit my springs well and the pins added an extra feeling of security. I could've rented something like this from an auto parts store &#34;for free&#34;, but I have heard enough words of caution about the abuse these things take. Knowing these were new and not repeatedly abused added to the peace of mind.
B00HRKBM12|5|I love my open windows when I drive, especially when raining.  I can now finally have them open all the time.  The visors are great!!!!
B00E9FXOM8|4|Worked. Thank you.
B003GXMJG6|5|My kids love it
B00WRG2U58|5|Fine
B004BT8DMI|5|Don't throw the box away until you drive your car in rain. the rubber slipped out of the holder in a thunder storm. I bought 2 pair of these PIAA blades and one of them was defective. One for my Infiniti & one for my Honda. They are fine blades.
B007USCM7E|5|This really is as good and easy as it sounds!  It took maybe 15 minutes to recharge my A/C in my car, and that included time to read the directions. Their website has info on where to find the hookup to recharge for your car model. If your system isn't totally empty and you don't use the whole can, you can easily store the rest for the recharge for the next car.  So much cheaper and quicker than a mechanic, and so easy!
B003ZS5B2Q|3|So okay
B00MYLQJX0|5|Greetings, I wonder if you bring 2 or 4 pieces. I would be interested to buy for extended F150 XL 2 doors.
B0012FKF9S|5|Love these
B008O8Z1KY|4|Ok, but make a little noise on a rough road.
B004GCDTOM|5|Had some front end damage after an encounter with the back end of a larger truck, this replacement part fit my truck perfectly and after I painted it to match, my truck looks even better than before.
B000E670Y4|5|nice item and better than the one I ordered from a classic auto warehouse.
B00KGNKJOI|5|Should last a long time. I put a few squirts in the resivoir every few weeks when I fill it with water.
B004BTBPC8|5|Don't throw the box away until you drive your car in rain. the rubber slipped out of the holder in a thunder storm. I bought 2 pair of these PIAA blades and one of them was defective. One for my Infiniti & one for my Honda. They are fine blades.

B009DJYH30|5|Had some front end damage after an encounter with the back end of a larger truck, this replacement part fit my truck perfectly and after I painted it to match, my truck looks even better than before.
B00KY096X8|5|Perfect fit.... as described on the site. Thank you and look forward to doing more business with you..
B007DIKEY4|5|I love the stickers, because it's shape is exactly the same as my Siberian Husky Roebel, who passed away a few years ago.<br />It's a perfect way to remember him.
B0049MICUU|4|good
B003Z9RFU6|5|The top fit like a glove, the instructions claimed it could be installed in 4 minutes, they were correct.
B00L4TF32G|5|Well Pleased with the results, makes things look new again. Will not be without it.
B00RU9HV06|5|Looks good, my mechanic installed it and said was a little tricky.
B0048SLONM|5|The motorcycle needed front brake pads. I ordered these EBC pads.  After installing the pads and not having much feel in the lever, lubricated<br />the brake lever pivot bolt and the top of the master cylinder piston, rode about 15 miles around the suburbs (lots of moderate brake use), and<br /> VOILA-now I have a strong, easy to modulate front brake.<br /> A quarter- million miles on motorcycles and I don't recall ever lubricating that brake lever bolt on any of my bikes. I am satisfied to have done<br />something new that made it really apparent how well the new pads perform.
B003WDMUC8|5|Very nice!
B0012H6HMK|3|Very cute.  Not very long string of lights.  Need a few strings at least.
B000BOLETQ|5|Looks as good as the The one the dealer sells for triple the costs. Very sleek and blends into the entire vehicle.
B00UA9VZKK|1|Very poor quality if I could give it a no star rating I would
B003SZ7R1E|5|Perfect fit! Window now works like new

B00HMZFEDO|4|Great product!
B00OMTAHYY|1|these were easy to install but the light output was so bad that i couldnt drive at night..super dangerous to use these..had to use my foglights to get enough light on the road to get home
B00D393XYA|5|I bought this for a 2006 Keystone Challenger with a Dometic awning, and overall am pretty pleased with it. The work to replace the existing awning was a bit of a bear, especially with one or two people, but I can't blame this product. Overall I was pleased with the quality of the workmanship and the material.
B0006FKFMC|4|Good deal
B00UJD7JVQ|5|Product was great. My son loved them and they arrived quickly.
B00GOQFIR4|5|I am very impressed with the quality and fit of these saddle bags!  They arrived way ahead of schedule and they fit my 2003 Wide Glide perfectly.  They seem to be made at a very high quality and I should get years of enjoyment from them.
B001O7PNNM|5|Very good
B000C5SGA4|4|good price for oem parts
B00EPDL9L2|1|Too small. Won't fit the steering wheel
B00BCRMBSO|1|Didn't fit properly, smells horrible, and very flimsy.  You definitely get what you pay for. .
B00CO043UM|4|Great pricing, quick service!
B000EVYGZA|5|Vey good
B00A1AX1VE|5|Fits perfect on my Tacoma.
