B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game! my son and daughter both love cleaning feeding and racing the horses. I love it too! I highly recommend this game.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Very entertaining.  Loved the cast!  Highlights the corruption in every crevice of our society (and I'm not talking about the bad guys)!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to read the verse of the day and also reade scriptures. I have told my family and they are looking forward to getting the Bible.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|This is my kind of pilot!!  I want Denzel & Goodman on all my future flights!  I'd give the movie an A but, after the great flight, the movie lagged a little & I wasn't keen on the ending.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Well crafted story telling.  The characters viceral content was compelling, cinematically seamless and<br />tightly directed.  The production quality well worth having a copy to share with family and freinds.
B0058Z4NR8|3.0|I had bought the book having very high expectations given the praise that the book has received. Although the book is not bad and I have read it entirely, I feel disappointed. Hardly anyone would disagree that institutions and the development path of a country matter, and that societies benefit from encouraging the contribution of all their citizens (and slaves, serfs,...). It is also laudable that the authors - in the tradition of Adam Smith, Macchiavel and others - have attempted to provide a great number of examples from all over the world, presence and past. Those examples which compare two nearby places with a shared history and culture are generally quite insightful (for example, the two Nogales or Ciskei/Transkei). The historical examples are less so, because the author invariably reduces the reasons for success or failure to the same few points without sufficient elaboration, often revealing a superficial knowledge. Countries rise when they become more 'inclusive' and fall when they become more 'extractive'. This is what happened to Venice and this explains the current state of Great Britain and the United States. Regrettably the authors overstretch their point, which they *repeat endlessly*.<br />One of the more 'bizarre' examples is the 'black death' of the mid-14th century, which is made responsible ('juncture') for the improved living standards in England by 1600 and the deterioration that the Eastern European peasants experienced. The authors' explanation is that the English society was more inclusive to begin with, so that the beneficiaries of an 'extractive' economy had less power than in Eastern Europe. That answer is rather simplistic to explain the diverging development over 250 years of turbulent history. The discovery of America, the rise of the Ottoman Empire, Reformation, Renaissance and many other events, that caused wars and shifted trade routes, are simply omitted.<br />The most valuable sections for me were about the colonial history in Africa and Asia. As book about Economics, it falls short because the authors rarely hit the nail.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|An excellent example of a production company's supreior craftsmanship.  I was especially<br />impressed with the power of Sally Hawkins subtle masking for her characters core<br />desires and emotions.  Her work was well supported by a skilled cast, direction and production.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|From the start it's displays adds at start. Every time you defeat a level more adds. When you play a level dropdown adds appear. Way way way to many advertisements to make  fan  enjoyable.
B00F35BV64|5.0|The director and cast delivered on another excellent revamp of the classic series.  As it is in an alternate universe, J.J. Abrams twists and turns the series's dogma while retaining its charm.  The movie further has multiple moral dilemmas including the use of drones and other long distance weapons against a country's own citizens rather than the guaranteed right of trial by jury.  Sci-Fi represents one of the few genres of film that can openly discuss political, moral, and social issues, and Star Trek is particularly famous for their commentary on current events ranging from conservation (Star Trek IV) to genetic engineering (Star Trek II).  This version of the saga does not disappoint.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This is absolutely one of, if not the best CD I have ever purchased.  I really hope she does another soon, because I am longing for more.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|As an adult I should be ashamed I suppose.  I like supernatural stuff, its really quite simple.  Its very, very hard to get good writing in that genre.  I was overall dissapointed by this book, was hoping for a second Bella and Edward experience but no, not even close!<br />Poorly drawn out charactors, weird plot twists and gaping holes.  Nah, not for me.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Still learning all this App can do to adjust some of the sub-optimal pictures in my collection.  A lot more versatile and user-friendly than the photo program in &quot;Office&quot;.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I still cannot open flash player files on my Kindle. I also detest the push ads it sends to my Kindle. Will be uninstalling this app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. Perfect for anyone who loves horses. Fun, cute, and realistic. Plenty of horses to choose from even unicorns and zebras. Love this game, I play it all the time. I definitely recommended it to anyone who likes, loves, or is crazy about horses. Best horse game I have ever played!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could say more, but is it really necessary? Must read for sci-fi fans, avid readers of all kinds, and especially those who like a little dash of post-apoc in their yarn (like me!)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. Look forward to more! I love match three puzzles and this one did not disappoint. I couldn't put it down.
B008Y768XO|5.0|For anyone who loves dogs this is a good movie to watch.  A touching true story of love and loyalty
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It's fun for the whole family. Makes you use strategy and problem solving skills. And those cute little guys are so much fun!
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I purchased two of these usb cables and  two of the  4 hour chargers. Thinking both new everything should work right?  wrong ..Contacted Amazon credited back one charger and didn't even offer to replace the chargers or the cables. Really standing by their product..What a joke
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's Facebook. LOL. But some things can't be seen with a mobile app. Don't know if that's this app, or all of them.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I am not a gamer and usually don't even play, but this game has great graphics and feel. I play on my Kindle Fire. Play it and you will live it too.
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|But getting stuck on one can run your time down. Then you have to start that &#34;chapter&#34; over. I got tired of getting stuck on the same puzzles/different chapters.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Its so funny and the people in it are amazing.  It is a classic and most definitely worth buying.  I love it!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|who is an Iron Man fan and she didn't really like it that much. Not quite what she expected. She prefers Minion rush.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The chromecast is pretty ho-hum, more of a parlor trick when compared to the Roku 3. Even though the Roku is a little more expensive (2.82 times in the case of the Roku 3) it's 10x's more useful.<br />As far as the chromecast goes I have it hooked up to a LCD monitor in my basement just in case I want to catch something on Netflix while I'm down there and I've found using my phone to control it is much more convenient than using a tablet.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is awesome and I'm so happy there is a mobile app for it! I spent the summer with a broken leg/on crutches and being able to get my Pinterest fix on a mobile device was perfect!
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|Great presentation and special effects. The movie is for the little kids--not so for the rest of us, The characters were flat and it dragged on & on. The characters did not earn our support--
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I am a fantasy nerd who likes the Wheel of Time, Harry Potter, etc. I read this book because it had great reviews. I am glad that I did! I even passed it on to my girlfriend to read and she loved it too. This is an awesome fantasy well worth a read.
1607744104|5.0|the only thing I wish it had was a trouble shooting section on each plant. Some questions just aren't answered.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Great writing, good character development, and interesting short and underlying story lines.  They packed a lot in the shortened only season, too bad it did not continue.  Still very much worth watching.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|Cantrell and the boys return with one of their best efforts yet, the songwriting, hooks, sludge, its all classic 'chains baby, this is by far much better than soundgardens latest, love that they opened it up a little more and let the bass shine through, i was transported back to 1994
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Not sure about the movie bought it and Amazon would allow the movie to be watched to my surprise with 2hrs left i noticed the movie in my library tried to watch it but was midnight I fell asleep wasted 4.99 kinda irritated at Amazon.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love the movie it is just amazin and I loved the price, my nephews were very happy with their gift
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|After recently watching the old Godfather series on TV I decided to actually read the original book.  It was a ground breaking book at the time it was published, shocking and imaginative.  In our world today, not so much.  It was a great summer read and enjoyable up to the very end.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I did enjoy this novel, however, I liked Kay far more when she was not a bundle of neuroses, just a strong woman. And Marino is just pathetic as a character in this book
0061122416|5.0|I love reading this every now and again when I need inspiration. At the moment I'm looking for a new job and ready to start a new chapter in life, and The Alchemist is a great reminder that I can do anything I want, and it's all up to me and my attitude. Helps remind me to think positively!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Helped me a lot with words I misunderstood. I wasn't confused anymore at school. I answered a lot of vocab words using this
B0085Y4JF0|5.0|Honestly I got this for a carbine class I was going to take, I needed something that would hold the load out required for the course and this did it. The mag pouches dont remove but there is  another version if you want that feature, this model has plenty of room for other molle attachments so no complaints
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds is a good game for many different ages..  My grandchildren, 2 to 16, like playing Angry Birds.  You can't beat it for the price.  FREE
B00746O3X8|4.0|For the money you can't go wrong , it could use a small pocket on the chest or belt carrier
B00A8ECU24|4.0|its being really weird I tap it it loads THEN it goes back to the menu... maybe its my kindle 'cause it gets messed up sometimes... anyways buy it if you like I think I can get it to work ^-^
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Keep up to date with the updates, we are soooo far behind<br /><br />There are so many issues, freezing, loading, force closing, you name it<br /><br />We really need this update, guys.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun little games and they don't take that long but are still challenging I like it can't wait to unlock them all.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|...with the magic of the story, the characters...I'm in love with the love within these pages! Family, star crossed lovers, mystery, young love...it's such an enchanting story. I will read it again I'm sure of it. I wish the things in here were real because it would be pretty awesome to see ha ha ha. Until then, I'll just read it a few more times.
B001THZAAI|5.0|Unexpectedly different.  Danny Boone's original script is refreshing, and clean to boot. If you don't understand French it's well worth having to read the subtitles.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Got this game so my niece and nephew would have something to play during downtime on a recent family vacation. They shared well and seemed to enjoy it.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I enjoyed the book. Especially, Dave's part and Rochelle' s. When David took over in court, I think he felt redeemed from his past at the large firm. Was also a good ending.
B0060MYK7G|4.0|I don't know what possessed me to buy this one after the first, probably the medieval aspects. Even so, a good TV-watch. lots of sneaky violent people all scheming to grab power and kill each other..
B00007KWHG|5.0|Anyone who loves the Four Seasons, or enjoy music like this, will not be disappointed.  Songs are all great and brings back fond memories of childhood.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Love this game.  Works great on my kindle fire.  No freezing up issue like some games have.  Some are easy others challenging. Try it you will get hooked
B00F35BV64|1.0|Definitely a movie lazily made with the only obvious reason to make it being to rake in money because it's part of an exquisite history making franchise.<br /><br />  The movie is a mash-up of bits and pieces of the original series and a couple of movies. Early series plots are twisted and thrown around in random order. The time line is tossed out the window in multiple places and the equivalent of lengthy chase scenes thrown in just to round out the overall low quality of the writing and to cover up what could only be extensive writer's blocks. Nothing original, this thing is a real mess. Nice special effects - there, something good.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|OK, Book 2 was my favorite of the trilogy. Book 1 was Meh and this one had me on a rollercoaster of Love and Hate the entire time. I didn't like the way Christian acted for a lot of this one. I'm not a prude by any means but there were some parts in this one that really had me cringing and made it difficult to read. The epilogue wrapped things up nicely but there were a lot of very awkward moments in it that sounded extremely inappropriate to me as a way to talk in regards to children. For the trilogy overall I would give 3.5 stars because I made it through them and there were many parts I liked but the repetition of lines was annoying (i.e. Inner Goddess, Oh My, etc) and there were several moments that made me want to stop altogether
0812982622|3.0|This was a very interesting book, but very violent and sadistic. It did give me some knowledge of North Korea, but since it is fiction I don't know how accurate it is.
1475143389|5.0|This is a great book! Easy to read and understand. Mike gets straight to the point of how to get in the shape you want, THE RIGHT WAY. The book is great because it cuts out all the BS that most people try to sell you when it comes to fitness, and explains the way to transform your body, the way you want it. Not only is the book great, but if you have any questions about things in the book or working out in general, Mike is only an email away, and is extremely knowledgable and helpful on the subject. I highly recommend this book and Mike's other books if you are looking to get into the best shape you have ever been in!
0307473465|5.0|Got this book and for the price totally worth it! Its got that old book smell which i love and would recommend!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I normally don't like Tom Cruise films, but he did a good job in this film. The plot seemed obvious at first, but then twisted for me. Not what I was expecting. Very small cast, all of them doing a very good job. I really liked the drones and portrayal of technology. I liked it.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|This is the best cd that I have listened to this year.  Not a bad track on the whole cd.  Monae is truly talented.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Mr Brown is quickly becoming one of my favorite and most reliable authors.  He skillfully tells a good story with interesting, well developed characters who are engaging.  This book is no exception.  The changes in venue are well wrought and support the pacing of the plot.  At several points I found myself literally resisting the urge to chew my fingernails!  I strongly recommend this book for anyone who loves suspense.  Personally I believe it would translate well to the movie screen.
1449433251|5.0|I ordered this a month and a half ago and it arrived after two days at my friend's house. But since this was going to be shipped by sea along with other things purchased in the US, it took more than a month before it reached the Philippines. Finally, I was able to receive it today and it was really worth the long wait. The glossy paper is nice to the touch that it gives me pleasure to skim through the pages. Reading it online doesn't compare to reading the strips on a physical book with smooth paper (LOL I'm a total bookworm). Of course the downside to the high quality paper is the weight. But there are always trade offs and I'm good with this one.<br /><br />The packaging was good enough but the case that the books came with had a dent on the corner which unfortunately also made a dent on Book 1. I admit that I can be OC with my books (no cracked spines please) so this bothered me and made me cringe a little.<br /><br />But overall, the collection itself is worth buying for yourself or as a gift for someone you know who loves Calvin and Hobbes.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL COMMENT 5/2/2014<br /><br />I'm not sure if this is just with my copy but - I've noticed that some of the strips are not placed chronologically but rather logically. Say a series of strips is continued from this week to the next, the Sunday colored strip will be placed AFTER the series and usually next to another Sunday strip. I noticed it mostly in Book Two, this wasn't so apparent in Book One.
014241543X|1.0|After reading all the reviews here, I was expecting to read a beautiful, masterful, moving story. Instead, what I got was the distinct feeling that I was reading a Young Adult book geared towards the 12-16 year old female demographic. Warning: This may be the harshest review I've ever written about anything. Ever. So don't read on if you've decided you're going to feel personally offended by an opposing viewpoint.<br /><br />I understand that this tale is being told through the voice of a teen girl, hence the naive and youthful tone, but I really feel it could've been done in a more lyrical, artistic way. I was expecting something along the lines of Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" -- which was literary art. It was transcendent. However, listening to Mia's \\"thoughts\\" was like nails on a chalkboard for me. Listening to a pretentious 17-year-old girl who lacks any real depth because her life has been SO charmed really grated on my nerves.  I didn't care about any of the characters -- none were particularly likable because they were all so cliche'd and caricature-ish.  I was irritated to the point of exhaustion by constantly hearing how awesomely fun and rad and liberal the parents were (it's like, WE GET IT ALREADY! The parents were ex-rock star hipsters! How surprising and unexpected!). And Mia's boyfriend is a handsome and famous rock star himself who -- gasp! -- surprises everyone by actually falling in love with her even though she's just a \\"nerdy\\" Juilliard-bound classical musician! Wow, what a hip dichotomy! Mia's backstory reads like a condescending junior-high romance novel, or a very bad Nickleodeon sitcom.<br /><br />The whole story came off as juvenile, amateurish, one-dimensional, incredibly cheesy (especially the parts that were meant to tug at the heart strings), way too obvious, and full of tired stereotypes. I couldn't get into it but forced myself to get to the last page, because I held out hope 'til the bitter end that this story might somehow redeem itself and resolve in a beautiful or unexpected way.  I was sadly mistaken.m itself and resolve in a beautiful or unexpected way.  I was sadly mistaken.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|One of the things I appreciate most about Chris Anderson's writing is the enthusiasm he brings to a topic. While reading this book I couldn't help but be inspired by this exciting new technology. Although I have read many books on 3D printing, the author's unique perspective adds greater insight into the present state of the art and where the technology is headed. While reading Makers, I couldn't help but be excited about the many possibilities that 3D printing has to offer. As the saying goes, the best is yet to come!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Read this book when you are forty and recapture your youth.  Read it when you are eleven and set your course.
B009GED3HS|5.0|It is an amazing show and I am so glad I could catch up on last season before the new one started.  Great Buy and I would do it again :)
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I love the game. Makes me crazy on some levels but just can not get enough of the game. Love it.l
0812983459|5.0|This has a story line that will keep you reading until you have finished it, it could be made into a beautiful one-person movie.
1601251505|5.0|Great book. Switching to patherfinder may be my groups best choice in years. Shipping was on time. I look forward to getting many more Pathfinder Books.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is a blast. It's so much fun and I highly recommend it for non golfers like me.<br />I enjoy learning golf terms as I play . Get the game and start your fun!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I'm sure I will be able to learn the game if I could sit down long enough to play it.  I'm just disapointed with the way it works on my Kindle
B00ANAC32U|4.0|Had the bumper for a couple weeks now.<br />It does have a little extra bulky feeling but it does feel the extra protection to the phone.<br />I felt some extra grip as well, and the buttons feels so natural you sometimes forget the bumper is on.<br />No sings of wear-out yet , time will tell.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|I gave this toy to my nephew to play with and we started by playing with it in my pool. It held up well. It is a sturdy, heavy, nicely detailed toy. And if you mostly play with legos and toy cars, it makes a pretty cool monster to attack your toy town or boats. the wings pop off and on and adjust but nothing else is movable which is why it is so solid. All around cool especially if you are into this kind of thing.
0062255657|4.0|Great short book - set up is quick and efficient, no worries with all the background information on every character - it just dives right in. We are again brought back to the essential - the imaginative - the simple in order to tell and retell a story. Complete with heroes, heroines, evil doers, and a twist here and there.<br /><br />I dare not go into details - what fun would that be? Go, and discover for yourself (and I bet you only need a day or two to in fact discover). Instead, I'll just leave with a few favorite quotes from the book - it gives a great snapshot of the tone of this little treasure.<br /><br />\\"Adults follow paths. Children explore. Adults are content to walk the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurs to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath rhododendrons, to find the spaces between fences.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nobody actually looks like what they really are on the inside. You don't. People are much more complicated than that. It's true of everybody.\\"<br /><br />\\"When I left, I went with Lettie Hempstock and her mother out of the front door, and the moon was a thin white smile, high in a cloudy sky, and the night was gusty with sudden, undecided spring breezes coming first from one direction, then from another; every now and again a gust of wind would contain a sprinkling of rain that never amounted to anything more than that.\\"
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|My husband and I went to the movies and I am sooo glad I picked this movie.  I thought it was an alien invasion movie.  It was intense from the first 5 minutes of the movie to the end.  It was a non-stop, on the edge of your seat movie.  Brad plays a great dad and husband. Definitely a keeper!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|My wife and I bought seasons 1-5 and are completely satisfied with our purchase. Our monthly income has grown exponentially but our dentally costs our through the roof. We bought a trialer just like the show and we call it meals on wheels. We decided to go with a Halloween based name for or charity,&#34;Crankenstein&#34;. Highly recommend this series.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I really love the way each of the women is portrayed so specific to their character. I learn so much about the history of that period. Love it.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|As is normal with all of Clarke's books, the story has two sides. The science fiction side is fascinating. The thought provoking side is wonderful.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast was easy to set up and work. My only complaint probably isn't Chromecast's fault. Sometimes the sound isn't synced with the picture. Perhaps my WIFI isn't up to snuff.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I am so excited about this grip.  I use this with my Canon T3i and it is very sturdy and well put together.<br /><br />I am very impressed and now use this most of the time I am shooting action shots.
B00821PCJS|3.0|The show is entertaining. The actors are all well suited for their rolls. Plot in somewhat predictable at times.  Overall not bad.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I really, really like this game. Graphics are awesome. Physics are great with the one exception that sometimes when you go over a jump, and you land nose first, your car just sticks there. This could happen in real life but the angle you hit the ground would have to be pretty steep for that to happen.<br /><br />I like the way there are different cars which have different driving characteristics. Some drift more than others, they have different characteristics when on grass, some are heavier, etc.<br /><br />I have now made it through the entire set of challenges. It took me a couple of months. I would say that in the challenges, early on, the time trial challenges are super hard while the racing challenges are super easy. So you end up spending a lot more time on time trials than racing, which is not cool because the races are much more fun. However, later, some of the racing challenges also get super hard. I do think the normal progression of challenges should be from easy to hard. It is not always that way. Sometimes you do one challenge 50 times before you pass it, and then the next one you pass it on the first try.<br /><br />My recommendations are to use the tilt steering and set the Auto Gas to on. If you can handle it, Auto Gas is the way to go.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a great game! Looking forward to more cars and hopefully more tracks in the future!
B0080BFVPU|5.0|Love the movie a lot  and purchase went through smoothly<br />Got it right on time and packaging was very good too
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Love the game great graphics<br />Like the solo play  upgrading equipment is a awesome ability makes the game level with paying platers
1451695195|5.0|This book was recommended to me by several people.  I especially enjoyed it because it was written by a neurosurgeon that did not believe in the hereafter before this experienc.
B00009Z574|4.0|Very under rated and under valued. Good rockers and Onward is a terrific ballad. Some great gems here, including the quirky Arriving UFO. Great musicianship.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|My husband and I still can't get enough.  This season was as good as the first.  Looking forward to the next one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great and will definitely make you think. I enjoyed all the puzzles as I get to start over after a factory reset on my kindle. You will enjoy and have hours of fun doing so. Get ready to think and stay under the best moves but sometimes you will go over the number of best moves in order to solve the puzzle. Have fun and prepare to be entertained.
B005UKK4Y2|5.0|Great movie! Perfect on Saturday night, Any movie that makes me laugh out loud is awesome. This is movie you can watch over and over and laugh everytime.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mods are awesome and I personally think the minecraft developer should add<br />A mod screen that has multiple mods so much that I have to know if they are adding mods eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
B0073O8BOS|4.0|Band of Skulls is a great band - if you haven't heard of them you should surely check them out!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I like this game reminds me of missile command. This is not the hardest game to play, but a great time killer. The game has good response and is true to the theme of the game. I have seen no in app purchase which I like. Try it it is worth it.
0066620996|4.0|Great book, great price! You really can't go wrong! I highly recommend this product - be sure to pick a copy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely could not put it down.  As much as I enjoyed The Hunger Games this was even better.  I can't wait to see how the story ends.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book. Story is fresh. Plot twist at the end - I never saw it coming! Don't just watch the movie, read the book too!
B007HO392S|5.0|Great songs and just enjoyed listern to Carrie Underwood sing, just reminds me of her concert in Portland Maine, just a great show.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Les Miserables - what's not to love! The motion picture soundtrack lives up to the broadway production and then some!
B0085CV0TA|4.0|Wow, lot's of action, funny moments. The characters are more realistic than action heroes, so it's fun to watch how they make it through obstacles.
B005TPCQ5I|3.0|This is a really good film! Love Anne Hatheway and everything that she does. She is amazing! Watch this movie!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|At first I was disappointed with the hair, I mean the comic book Thor had beautiful long golden locks. Aside from that it was action pack and his vulerabilty was quite funny.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Very cute remake of the Dr. Seuss book. I love the original film The Lorax, and this is cute remake.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Amazing how one place could be at the center of music history.  The fact that Dave Grohl is saving the sound board and recording with it fantastic. Loved the whole thing. A must watch for any person who loves music and wants to know more about how their favorite music was made.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|What's not to love? This i one of the best books EVER. READ IT! Don't just watch the movie! Trust me!
B00BIK06JG|5.0|This case is a perfect fit for the DCS-HX300 camera, and really helps stabilize and protect the camera when added into our larger gear bag. Great purchase.
1781162646|5.0|I loved this book like I haven't loved a Stephen King book in a long time. Could not put it down and I love a book like that! Thank you Mr. King from a loyal constant reader.
B008602KQI|5.0|I hadn't thought I would like the movie, but was totally surprised.  I am looking forward to the sequel due out in November.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game would hope that everyone would try this game at least once, that's all you need cause u will love it
B009AY04A8|3.0|Game was ok. It helped pass the time away while I waited at doctors office, until I got more lives on a sugary sweet addictive game. Lol
B002OLE1XU|4.0|It's rare that with a sequel you'll feel they're as good, or better than the original, but these are. They franchise is basic, but all the right ingredients are there to make them fast and fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Three words: BEST GAME EVER. Minecraft is my favorote game and this is perfect because I can take Monevraft amywhere!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|There was nothing that really jumped out to make this movie stand out against many of the other space movies, but its still an enjoyable story. There is a pretty good twist towards the end, and it did help to give a interesting element to the movie.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|My fiesta reacher mystery and it leaves me a little disappointed  lack of character depth and soft story line. I like the<br />Reacher personality but the story is predicable
1401938906|5.0|Love it !!  Freaking me out a little and also forcing me to go back and do what I have known for some time now. Thankyou. :)
B003K15INU|4.0|H was writing about a time that I felt that I lived through and I could have been part of the story.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Renee Olstead is one of those rare finds in female Jazz vocals.  Like Norah Jones, she brings her own singing style and charm to the table.  She started out young, and continues to grow in her art.  She has lost a bit of the &#34;cuteness&#34; (physically and vocally) of her debut album, but her delivery is also more mature, putting her in the same company, in my opinion, as just about any of the female jazz legends out there--living or dead.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I recommend this game if you like arcade games. This is a great game tons of fun....love it! Gotta get it.
0374214913|2.0|I bought this book based on all the rave reviews and the intriguing subject matter. Sadly, I found myself struggling to continue reading it. I'm confused about how this book received so many stellar reviews and recommendations. In my opinion, this book is better as a sleep aid then for entertainment. Boring!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I  relax when I play the game . That's why  I play  it all day long<br /> and 'll the time.  I really recommend it it is fun.  :):):):)
0763619612|5.0|Love it so much!!! Can't wait to use it in my classroom and teach my kids to make their mark!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my daughter loves it and is a master at this game and can change chararters and get money or coins to buy new items or levels she loves it
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is fun and easy. It is just challenging enough. I love how you can earn the tools and boosts and don't have to pay real money for everything (although that is an option, you don't have to do it to play the game) there are lots of levels too, and its free!
B004SBX112|4.0|Its great when im bored. i bought it to pass the time away from life and sorts lol lol lol
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Very entertaining. I bought it for the 3D effects. I haven't watched the DVD or Bluray version but the 3D version is magnificent. Good story line good acting and great 3D effects. A great addition to my 3D collection.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|A bit too much to follow sometimes. I also found the picture on the dark side. They left plenty of room for sequels.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much. Emphasized the man more than the machine. I do hope he has a new suit by the next movie though.
1616550414|5.0|this book is done well has lots of pictures and intresting things to read for the Zelda fans in the world. it sits in a special spot on the book shelf.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens next...I feel like 5 books is a bit unnecessary but it won't stop me from reading them! I am invested!
B00AO686G0|4.0|so i am not a super fan when it comes to if this movie was as good or better or worse as it was in the theatre over all i like the movie i think there should be more Rodger Rabbit in the world it is a nice intertaining movie that might be hitting on the older adult side of disney entertianment but i think any &#34;hidden bad parts&#34; are still in this movie if there really are any to start with and it is fun and entertaining move with some real good back story to how it ever was created in the first place seeing as how there seems to be so many cartoons in it that Disney does not own, but it is good because the world in where most of it takes place is where all toons live and so it was good to see more then just the Disney toon family in it.
0131480057|5.0|I have only read a few chapters so far. each gives a lot of good information that every Unix sysadmin should know.
B00BAB6CNC|4.0|ok so it is not that i dont like this band but i guess i was thinking that they were going to be more like anohter group. so now that i have heard 2 of there cd's i feel that House of Gold and Bones part 2 is a better cd then the first one. they have some epic songs and they seem to rock out more on this one. some songs remind me of Metallica S&M cd while another song will remind me of Nine Inch Nails. there does seem to be a bit of the slipKnot in some songs as well but i guess this in a way comes off that the group is looking for there &#34;sound&#34; or just like to mix up whatever fits the bill or comes to mind for most people that like this level of music they should like this cd, but it is still not SlipKnot..
0316044695|5.0|It's an amazing story for both types of people. The story can be read by people who look to join, or those who want to see a brotherhood
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|this is a nice hit of a movie that i think most people could relate to in someway or another. seems to have a great anti hero and fun storyline, it might be hard to make a Wreck-it Ralph 2 but who knows what magic can come of it. i think it hits a cord with any one that grew up not being the popular kid at or in school and shows that they are needed to in the world.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Most excellent and touching.  Made me cry. Thanks to all who helped make it possible.<br />Bless you all<br />J. Back
B004UNX1LS|4.0|My generic droid tablet won't play youtube but this vevo app helps relieve some of the sting. I recommend this app.
B000W91RUG|4.0|I loved the show, two of the episodes wouldn't play but I bought the season used. Overall happy with the product it shipped fast!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This whole series is fantastic. It's so intricately woven together and the characters are so beliveable that it's hard to put it down. I don't have much time to read so I usually only read a book once but this is my second time through this series.  Cassandra Clare is a very imaginative writer and can create a world, storyline, and characters like no other writer I've ever read.
B0018QQQKS|5.0|So far, The Ascent of Money has exceeded my expectations (full disclosure - I am roughly halfway through the book).  Fans of Ferguson's miniseries of the same name on PBS will certainly enjoy the book, although it does cover some of the same territory (as to be expected, the book goes into much more depth than the TV series).  Ferguson's writing is straightforward and common-sensical, and he has developed a style that makes the material both entertaining and informative, while avoiding coming across as overly didactic or lecture-y.  Yes, he is distilling complex, nuanced case studies to several pages or a chapter, but to my eyes it's done in a way that highlights the prime issues and drivers behind a historical event (such as the hyperinflation experienced by Germany post-WWI) while leaving the finer points to academic discussion.<br /><br />In short, a great read on an intriguing topic, and one that will keep me coming back to Ferguson's writing.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I bought it for grandson. Turns out he already had it at his house but that was fine because now he has it at our house, too!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Enough realistic looking science to make it believable. Great actors playing great characters. With this being my second time through the series - I watched it when it first came out - the first season is just a warmup. Highly recommended!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a fun app that kills lots of time I like how you have to play to unlock more levels and earn coins to move on
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Great chess game and for something that is free you can easily play it and always enjoy it. Definitely a game you should have.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Watching this all over with our teenage kids.<br />They cannot get enough of it !<br />Good life lessons and well written stories.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great actors. Plot is slow moving at times, but still absolutely loved it. Feels a little like Anne of Green Gables to me.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|From the time I did the trial I fell in love,  and since I have a Samsung I normally get my apps from Playstore,  but they don't allow my country to purchase apps which restricted me from getting the full version.  Thankfully I went to SwiftKey help and it directed me here,  allowing me to buy it and now I have it on my phone and tablet :)
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|Great special (CGI) effects & 3D, so-so story line, with some good acting on the cast's part doing all the &#34;blue screen&#34; work.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app is interesting. I think it has lily in it because I got lily from mcdonals(that I do not like now) and I love her now and do not instal ponycraft. it let me be a zombie insted of making something that is supost to be a pony.  :-(
B004GJYROG|5.0|My son is obsessed with Jordan. He loves this movie. Descent movie and ok for kiddos to watch...nothing terrible that they shouldn't see.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|wasn't expecting it to be this good..everybody played their part exceptionally well...love love love Mathew's character..I'm glad it was on Amazon prime..got to watch it free..thank you Amazon.com
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Celtic woman is a group with a lot of talent, and some really beautiful music. This is a great release for anyone who likes the style.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|As a creature of habit, I'm a die hard pen and paper note-taker. I'm getting used  to using Evernote since I can access it from any o  my devices at anytime.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I'm really glad I bought the blu-ray, instead of the dvd. the effects in the blu-ray were astounding! best movie i've ever seen.
B000091OMZ|5.0|This is one of favorite PSB records. I was happy to find an unopened copy of this on a vinyl record.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is a really good read and reminds me of another great book I read recently, [[ASIN:B00EUGVXJ2 Red Rock Redemption]]. In Die Trying (great sequel to Killing Floor), Reacher ends up battling it out with domestic extremists set on acts of terrorism.  The hard pounding action leaves you on the edge of your seat, and while you know Reacher will eventually overcome, you're never quite sure how.  Highly recommended!
B00CL8DKE2|3.0|this wasn't the best PSB record, but it isn't the worst either. Boshey is the best song on it. I like Behavior best.
B00005JMCW|5.0|i LOVE LINDSEY LOHAN AND JAMIE LEE CURTIS - WHO DOESN'T LOVE JAMIE LEE CURTIS OR THE YOUNGER GENERATION LINDSEY LOHAN - THEY'RE BOTH INCREDIBLE ACTORS<br /><br />THE MOVIE WAS HYSTERICAL !!! I WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN ....<br /><br />THIS IS ONE FOR YOUR COLLECTION .... BUY IT ... !!<br /><br />GREAT, GREAT MOVIE!
B00008YLV2|5.0|Very good portrayal of actual events. Quite graphic - but I'm sure not as bad as actually being there. One of the top military movies available. Read Bowden's book too - well worth it - Incredibly well researched.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|I had no idea what to expect -  hadn't even heard of the movie, but it was excellent! the young boy who was the main character was an incredible actor.  The movie was sad, but it really makes you think ... especiallly not only dealing with 911, but understanding the brain and intellligence of this young boy!<br /><br />INCREDIBLE! I own it and I'm glad I have it in my collection!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I did not like as I did the other Dredd movies. Something was missing<br />through movie.  WHY DO I HAVE WRITE THE NUMBER OF WORDS YOU WANT. I WRITE WHAT I WANT OR I WILL NOT WRIT ANYTHING.!!!!!!!!!!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This story is about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness just like most summer reads. It will tell you where to go and give you the feeling you should have for the situation at hand. Where this book captured my attention was the split between old world (pre 2002 everything is found on the internet) and new world (why not just ask a computer).<br /><br />The story evolves into a question of &#34;If it is worth doing, then why not do it yourself instead of letting the machine do it for you?&#34; This is not the Matrix or Terminator. This is not questioning if computers makes life easier. This is simply a question of do you want to do it? And if you do, is it wrong to use everything at your disposal to do it?
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have had the displeasure to watch in a long, long time. It is not worth the rental price, even if the rental price was free, it still would not be worth the rental price. There was nothing appealing in this movie, not the action, not the very thin plot, it was not even in the same vein as the rest of the series. Do yourself a favor and skip right over it.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Never watched it when it was on but my eight year old loves to sit at night and watch it! Better than some of these shows on TV today.
B00DC6YEE2|3.0|I haven't watched it yet in 3D, but the original movie is (of course) awesome.<br /><br />But I just purchased the BluRay (non-3D) \\"Collector's Edition\\" a few years ago, and paid $32 for this 20th Anniversary 3D Edition at a local chain store.  After getting home to look at the Special Features, they are the exact same as the one from a few years back.  There is NO new content or special features, in fact I think the other non-3D discs are exactly the same printing.<br /><br />I was hoping that the \\"20th Anniversary Edition\\" would at least have SOME NEW features, but the only thing you get extra is nicer packaging.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I loved this book.  It was thoroughly engaging and brought me into a world I knew a little of and educated me more on.  Mr. Johnson's style of writing was unique and inviting.  Highly recommend!
0316056898|5.0|I strongly recommend this book, especially the audiobook.  Her life is a great story but also well-read and funny.<br />Congrats Tina
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's really good but some people might not like it and I think it's more for girls than boys though. See uhh boys.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Loved this book. The author has a  wonderful way with words. Many of her phrases were so original, made me think, where did she come up with that. The ending was unique, I will definitely  read her other books.
1451695195|5.0|It gives hope for the future that there is more left to explore than the life we are given on this earth.
B00486070K|5.0|Doesn't tie up the thunderbolt port.<br />Never had any issue with it for 4 months.<br />Works with USB hub, I just leave it connected to the USB hub on my desk at work.
160459201X|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time, much better than T.N.T.  although T.N. T. was very well written, and more powerful reading than,&#34; The Secret&#34;.  T.N.T.  by Joseph Murphy went deeper into training the mind to reach for things wished for in life and believing you will receive them. It is a powerful book to claim biblically, &#34;what so ever you ask for BELIEVING&#34;, you shall receive.  Training the mind to think positive and never looking at situations in a negative way. I was very pleased that I purchased this book, and you will be too!!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Since virtual cores don't mean squat for gaming this processor can't be beat on performance or price. Had no issues with any games so far.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is simply exhilarating! It is one that I could not wait to pick up again and find out...what next?! I cant wait to start book two! Definitely a must read!
B00CDY6HW6|3.0|I bought this for my kindle.  Graphics ok nothing special.  Very easy to figure out with instructions and easy to get profecient.  Nothing too challenging but worth an hour of two of your time.  I played 3 games before I became bored and have not touched it since.  This game is geared towards younger players and is good clean fun.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|It had my interest through out the entire read, but the ending was disappointing. I was left with a few questions.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|A friend suggested that I read these books and I was always there ready to purchase the book the day it came out. Best read ever
1451695195|1.0|Author Eben Alexander is a disgraced neurosurgeon who has very profitably reinvented himself as a religious icon. His medical career ended after he was forced to resign from three successive hospitals for, among other things, making surgical errors and hiding them by altering patient records. His narrative of his emergency room experience and coma have been thoroughly debunked by those who treated him.<br /><br />His book is written for the gullible who seek supernatural explanations for the unknown. They will find what they are looking for. Anyone curious enough about the author's credibility to do a bit of Googling will quickly smell a fraud.
1250030951|5.0|I loved Fangirl, hard!<br />Why did I love it?<br />Why didn't I love it would be the better question.<br />Rainbow Rowell can write some amazing YA. I think the dialogue is my favorite. It's real, unforced and refreshing.<br />She also writes unforgettable characters. Cath and Levi I love so much that I just want to put them in my pocket and carry them around with me all of the time.<br />This book was funny and sad and frustrating and I could NOT put it down. I feel like I might have read it too quickly and now I need to reread to savor more.<br /><br />My advice: READ FANGIRL!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Tons of action, humor and intelligent dialogue!  Perfect sci-fi action flick!  We have watched this movie several times and never get tired of it!
B009LDD22U|5.0|This is a great product, the only down side to this is that the digital copy does not allow you to watch it on itunes, and cant download it digitally except from uv or flixster. Having blue ray AND standard dvd version is great to take and watch anyplace!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best clock app out there!!!  Super!!!!!!!!! Would recommend to anyone who wants something more then a basic clock app.  Best one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Don't get this game if want to keep your sanity, it's so damned addictive. So very enjoyable, pity it's one dimensional
B00BCX2F66|4.0|It doesn't have a magnet to close, as Samsung covers go, is the initial thought right after snapping it on. Standing it on a desk, it still slides, you have to jimmy it. I am able to flip it in a way that I place it over my car speed barometer spot where it poofs up enough at a 10 degree angle to where I can see my Google Maps Navigation app run as I'm driving (Volkswagen Jetta). You know how suede goes; you can't get it wet and gets dirty after some use, but I still like it!
B001NLL93W|5.0|great book, but you need to have read the previous ones.  Hope they do this one justice in the movie  :)
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|The more I watch, the more I see of the great character development.  This movie is really a great study personalities and how they effect our lives.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Liked it, you should watch it too.  Fun plot twists, great action sequences, an action movie with a brain.  Good watch!
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I loved it, worked great ! I like all the features, sync was easy enough. I put it on to charge one night, now, nothing, no power, no screen.
6304779607|4.0|Excellent and entertaining movie, high quality, and in original mint condition. Great movie for stallone fans, and lovers of 80's memorabilia.
B009ZQJ0ME|2.0|Looked to have promise as an understated dystopian study of themes familiar from 1984/Brave New World in the style of Gattaca until it takes a turn into silly Matrix-like shenanigans.  Plot resolves with all the sophistication of a chainsaw.  Disappointing.
B009B1UZ7C|4.0|Excellent and wonderful CD high quality, and in original mint condition. Great CD for lovers of folk music and early 60's rock. fans, Very Dylanesque
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Movie did not disappoint in the loud actioneer department, and provided better entertainment than hoped for.  A nice surprise when I had pretty low expectations.
B002GHHHH4|4.0|Excellent and entertaining movie, high quality, and in original mint condition. Great movie for stallone fans, and lovers of 80's memorabilia.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Explosions, fights, guns, and more explosions. If you want to sit and be entertained, this is a good movie. Glad I watched it.
B000LC4ZF8|4.0|Excellent and entertaining movie, high quality, and in original mint condition. Great movie for hanks fans, and lovers of 80's memorabilia.
B00D3ZJDRA|5.0|The album is fantastic. The sound is superb and everything I hoped for. I ordered this artist after I hear an interview with her on NPR. If you like good music, this is the one to buy. I also liked that I got a download of the album when I purchased the actual physical object. Now, the person I bought it for can listen to it on his record player and I can listen on my phone and PC. It's a win for everyone.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|The idea was marvelous.  My husband and I can relate to that, since we are both considered OLD.  (He is 90, I am 86!)  The story was superb and, of course, it had some actors and actresses that I love, including my all time favorite, Maggie Smith!  Although a little opera goes a long way for us, we enjoyed the whole movie.  The characters were finely drawn.  Only drawback:  we didn't get to see Maggie Smith sing!!!  Please thank Dustin Hoffman for bringing this to life!
B0012PDVQ2|3.0|I watched this movie to see why people have loved it for so many years. It made no sense, was not super amazing and I do not feel like I had a life changing movie experience. The best part was the light up umbrellas.
B00EUIO8Y2|3.0|From what I watched of the DVD, stunning visuals, lighting, yes.  I have heard \\"Girl Gone Wild\\" off the CD and that was it.  On the DVD, it was alright. Madonna's continuing religious dark satire is getting old and tired.  On my 5.1 A/V system, while playing this DVD in surround sound mode, there was no sound from the right front and right rear surround channels.  I checked other sources in my system and other DVDs, there was no problem with these things. Overall, not her best effort and someone needs to remix the audio.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Best movie of all time. I watched it as a child and now my children love watching it. I love watching their imaginations run wild while we watch together.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the writers of the show. It was well scripted! If it wasn't for Amazon Prime I would've had a chance to watch Season 1 and now I'm hooked!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Year  ago my now ex girlfriend told me to read the  perks of being a wallflower. I did and I loved it. Books mad  me depressed  after than but this one made me feel great after wards. It might  be closed  to as good as the perks. She has a very good taste in books (my ex that is) and she told me to read miss peregrene`s home for peculiar children. So that might  be a good book too. But this book is definitely one I wish I bough  in paperback instead of kindle edition.
B00004CYR8|1.0|When I tried to play it, a statement came up indicating that it could not be played in my region. To return it, the postage would have cost more than the tape itself. I would like to get a playable version sometime, since I heard it was a funny movie.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game a lot of time passed playing it.<br />Started playing can't put it down. A must buy!!! You won't be disappointed
B008XG1X18|5.0|I sit and look over Pinterest in the evenings to relax. I have gotten so many new ideas and recipes. Love, love, love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it. It's fun and works perfectly! Whenever I'm bored and I have my kindle, I always know what to go to. xD Really great buy. Although I bought it for $2.99 when it was still new.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|Very sad yet understandable story.  We all at one time thought ourselves invisible and on some level capable of taking on the world with our ideals.
1609611543|5.0|Dr. William Davis (cardiologist) has delivered a fundamental insight into one of the great destroyers of human health in the West. Dr. Davis has written like a physiologist, neurologist, archaeologist and sociologist of human history, especially the cultivation of wheat. In this astonishing book Dr. Davis has delineated the precise correlations (supported by indisputable clinical science) between modern wheat consumption and obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, celiac and \\"silent celiac disease\\" which produces such profound digestive problems throughout the developed world. Convincing bridges between wheat and the aging process, neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other diseases of the mind that go with premature and early aging), and disorders of the largest organ of the body (the skin) are described. Davis' prose style is utterly limpid and engaging, and a rarity in clinical science, a literal page-turner! You'll want to read this book in your study, on the bus, during your lunch hour, in the bath and on the toilet. Gripping narrative of the way eating and health and disease are utterly connected!<br /><br />No single human allergy can cause more neurological dysfunction than gluten, the protein found in wheat. Gluten sensitivity (\\"wheat allergy\\") means the immune system has an exaggerated response to gluten that leads to inflammation throughout the body and potentially to an autoimmune reaction, in which the immune system attacks and destroys body and even brain tissue. Many people with uncontrolled food allergies have silent celiac disease, meaning they do not experience intestinal symptoms. Instead, the immune system's reaction to gluten is experienced in your skin, joints, and your organs and brain.<br /><br />There have been dramatic increases in the number of gluten sensitive people in the United States in the past 50 years. The average American today eats wheat at every single meal. What's worse, the immune response to gluten can last up to 6 months each time it is ingested. It is estimated that 81% are predisposed to gluten intolerance, and 43% of Americans to celiac disease (which is only the final stage of gluten intolerance).<br /><br />Tragically gluten sensitivity is often overlooked by the health care system. It may be that you've been treated improperly for decades because your physicians have not diagnosed this autoimmune condition going on in you. Physicians are not trained to identify gluten sensitivity and are still operating with outdated models of celiac disease diagnosis. The criteria for diagnosing celiac disease are very limited. [[ASIN:0988745216 Applied Kinesiology Essentials: The Missing Link in Health Care]]<br /><br />According to a recent paper in Lancet Neurology, called The Gluten Syndrome: A Neurological Disease, gluten sensitivity is not primarily associated with celiac disease or gut damage and can solely and directly harm the brain and nervous system, leading to a number of different neurological problems. What this means is that many of the reactions people have to foods involves their brain, with an immune system assault (due to gluten) being the cause. This will lead to brain inflammation and increase the risk for an autoimmune attack on brain tissue. In cases of gluten sensitivity the immune system mistakes nervous tissue for gluten. This is called cross-reactivity, a concept in immunology in which the immune system mistakes one protein for another - the protein structure of gluten is similar to protein structures in the brain and central nervous system. Other foods that commonly cross-react with gluten include casein (the dairy protein), yeast, oats, sesame, and some brands of instant coffee. Many clinicians find removing casein, the protein molecule in all forms of dairy, is also integral to restoration of health in people with wheat allergies. Dr. Davis' subsequent books on how to go Wheat Free are brilliant as well! [[ASIN:1609619366 Wheat Belly Cookbook: 150 Recipes to Help You Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]]<br /><br />The best test for \\"Wheat Belly syndrome\\" is the elimination-provocation diet in which gluten is completely removed from the diet for 2 weeks, and then re-introduced while the person monitors their reactions. It is not uncommon to see major resolution of many symptoms just by following a gluten-free diet.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have waited for a long time to see this season.  Excited to begin watching it.  Hope I can get it in before 4 begins.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|It was one of the best movies I have her seen, plus Channing is easy to look at :-)<br />Great Movie, nice story
B003L77G06|5.0|After viewing one episode of season one, I knew that  I had to have all the seasons.  Waiting for my season 4 to come in the mail.
B000YDG5X4|5.0|i found the product very comfortable and it fits perfect. it looks better than the picture and does not hurt at all
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Wasn't sure if this show was for me, but after watching one episode, I knew that I had to keep on going.  Waiting for season 4 to come in the mail now !!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. It's a great stress reliever and a good way to relax in the evening. My only compliant would be trust sometimes it's really hard to finish a room because the cards don't come up as often as you need then to. But that's just a part of the game if it was easy it would't be fun.
B0053O89RY|5.0|How else can you review this sitcom but as THE BEST !!!  I loved it so much I never buy series sets like this but knew that I could watch these over and over again and still laugh !!!
0812993845|3.0|I was a little disappointed with this book. It was definitely not up to the standard I expect from Sophie Kinsella. It was ok, but not great. I actually enjoyed the storyline of the main character's sister the most. I think when the supporting characters are more likeable than the main character, it's a problem. C'mon Sophie, you can do better!
B00000DGUY|5.0|This is one to check out, this version offers very good clarity being between cd and sacd formats, no regrets on this purchase!
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this in theaters, especially after the initial early reviews, most of which were favorable.<br /><br />After seeing it, I was seriously letdown. All the characters are dumber than rocks- a scientist pets an unknown alien creature, of which no human has ever seen before, like it was a dog or cat. WTF? He's a scientist, he should no better. Another character gets lost in the alien building being explored despite A) having floating GPS spheres mapping the area for him, and B) the captain at the titular ship has a map of the building as well. How can he get lost?<br /><br />The plot holes are big enough to fit the Milky Way Galaxy. Why does David, the android, purposefully poison one of the doctors? Why are there no military personnel of any sort?<br /><br />The movie ucks, and it's anti-climatic, not even answering it's own very shallow questions. Avoid at all costs.
B0000AYL17|5.0|This is one of the very best I own among SACD, dts hd, DVD-A and Dolby true hd. This multi channel mixing is incredible and the vocal clarity is great, buy this version, you will not be disappointed!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Music is in a different part of the brain; it makes you wonder.  It would be wonderful if such a place existed.  It kept me thinking after it was over.  Would like to hear the director's thoughts on the making of the film.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I hated the ending to season 3 and cried. Enough death for now!! Next you'll do something silly like have the widow and widower hook up.... NOOOOO.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It would be a cute game but was a huge disappointment.  I have plenty of space on my tablet but kept saying no space.  I would get it to work then it would stop and I would have to re-install. All other people had the same problem.  Even for free very frustrating!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was awesome nothing like I though it would be.  Before reading it everyone was talking about the book as an XXX rated book, but I certainly would not consider it an XXX rated with the story it has.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Started off a little slow but love the story. Great ending kinda a tear jerker. Wanted to read more from this author but a little pricey.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I can't tell you how wonderful this book is, you just have to read it to realize the wonderful story of two people thrown together and how it ends.  Let me say the ending of Book three is not what I expected, could have drawn it out or made another book.  Too blunt of a change. I am curious to find out how the end is handled in the movie.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Good plot, interesting characters. I'd watch it again and left wondering how they'll return. Enjoyable and instant with prime membership.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series of books is nothing like people have said.  It has a great story line, not just about sex and bondage which doesn't have much of it.  It is more of a true love story and can't wait for the movie and hope it doesn't loose any of it's content like so many movies do after their books.
034580404X|5.0|i have this set loved it my sister has been looking for the box set and of course amazon came though again and price was outsatanding so or her birthday i couldnt pass up her bday is seopt 28 arrive was too be seopt 15 perfect it can way early early sept 12 so no worrys her gift would b on time thanks amazon
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Best game ever you need to buy this game just like gta.<br />And everyone loves gta. So buy it. NOW!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret was the kind of book that you just can't bear to put down.  It tells the tale of the murder of a young girl and how it impacted her family, the murderer, and the community.  The twist of fate is especially cruel.  Excellent reading.  Highly recommended.
B0017MO10U|5.0|As a Stargate SG-1 fan I really wanted this for my dvd library. I was not in the least disappointed. The video arrived in great condition and came before delivery due date. I recommend this to other Stargate fans. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The author did such a great job keeping you intrigued with all of these characters! I read the book within 24 hours because it was TOO good to put down!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is the best app that you can have ur favorite u can listen to your favorite song while your are sleeping u can also check the weather
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Having grown up in the Philly area, I was pretty sure this movie couldn't capture the essence.  I was wrong.  The family dynamics, background and characters are all authentic, at least to my experience.<br /><br />This movie translates well past the Philly area, though.  The character dynamics alone are worth watching.  My movie library is quite small, only those films I can watch multiple times.  This movie makes the cut.  I recommend this movie to family and friends and now to even complete strangers.
B001M1ETTO|4.0|I really bought this album just for MOMENTS IN LOVE but its a good album for me to put on for a nice drive or motorcycle ride.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Enjoy all episodes of Castle. Have been a viewer from day one and having the complete season allows me to view anytime.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Great movie! Makes u see how things were in the south years ago & how far we have come in the years since then.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Enjoy entire series to date. Want to be able to view at my leisure so have purchased all five seasons.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was sad when the book was over, it is very well written, and it is a really fantastic read!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Hace viewed Castle episodes from day one. Enjoy having entire 5 seasons to view at my leisure. Also like interaction at end of series-personalizes characters
B009LDD1X0|1.0|I was verbally abused with ad hominem attacks after reviewing the last full-season DVD offering of this horrendous program known as The Big Bang Theory, and whether the same fate will greet me this time around or not, it has to be said that this is the single most annoying sitcom in the history of television. Season 6 just so happens to keep the streak alive.<br /><br />Each crude drawing of a character is simply a thin husk of what a well-rounded human being might ever be, and as such, it's impossible to feel anything but disgust for the whole lot of them. Johnny Galecki might possibly get a pass solely for his previous work, but the rest of the cast simply exists as lollipop-esque embodied voices that can give the nouveau-dorks out there some sort of masturbatory flag to wave as they rally on to whatever activity will exclude them next...until they have a tantrum and picket the place in full cosplay regalia. Seriously, how these goofs could possibly mix up steampunk and 80's haute couture is beyond me...<br /><br />...Like the show, don't like the show. I'm sure we could still possibly be friends. But please, as a service to the decency of future generations, buy your collection of this 6th season of The Big Bang Theory, with all of its commentaries, special features and easter eggs, and promptly burn it. You need this about as much as I need more cancer.<br /><br />I implore you to be good to yourselves and abandon this faux-nerd glad-handing. Go get really involved with something. Enjoy a new hobby that enriches your life with a foundation of skills or blooming friendships. Learn something inside and out, scrape every facet down to the bone and make yourself an expert. And for the love of whatever you hold dear, don't present these money-grubbing cash demons with yet another opportunity to distract you from being the great person you're destined to be.<br /><br />The Big Bang Theory, Season 6: .5/5 stars, simply because they persist in offering a horrible thingto otherwise decent people by tricking them. If you're addicted, help is available.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|This app would not even open for me. I deleted it. May try again but will delete again if it does the same thing.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Yes it is twisted but having seen some of the later episodes this does help to answer a few questions.
1439152810|5.0|GREAT READ!!! A Lot of Back and Forth so this is a novel you don't want to put down for a while., or you may get lost... but the author does such a great job in keeping you wanting to know and read more that you won't need to worry about that.  This novel takes you back in time during war., mystery and love.  It has a great twist at the end!!! I can't wait to read my next book by Kate Morton \\"The Distant Hours\\"!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Thought provoking. Since the writer is a recognized authority in neurosurgery it makes you want to believe.I would recommend it.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Learned a lot about sacrifices and courage it takes for Armed service especially Special forces.<br />Very good read, exciting, fast paced.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Addictive and lot's of fun.  Graphics are OK and response is good.  Instructions could use a beef up.  It doesn't make it clear that you have to have a minimum number of building points before you can use your repair/upgrade points to get the upgrades (eggs., more missiles, etc.)  But over all I have wasted many hours on this.
B0041I8UYU|1.0|was missing the cover but everything else was good good show one of my favoriate shows right now on tv
B004DMIIUU|5.0|The film was amazing! From the same director of Casshern this film goes all out with the CGI effects and the acting is A-quality as well. Advertised as a Japanese Robin Hood, it is far more than that. Goemon is a former ninja turned thief after his master, Lord Nobunaga is killed. Fifteen years later he is drawn back into the courts political machinations after he steals Pandora's Box from where it was hidden in the vault of the deputy marshall. The historical context does get tweaked but the director explains this on the bonus disc. He wanted to portray an alternate vision that would show the viewer the grandiosity of Feudal Japan. He succeeds. The superhuman feats of both the hero and foes adds to the film in a way that outdoes some &#34;marvel&#34; movies. No way to further review this other than to recommend to both action film goers, Japanese cinemaphiles, and for those that enjoy 5-star films. After Casshern and Goemon will watch for future films from this director.
B008TT7CXW|2.0|I purchased this with an open mind and quire frankly because it looked to be the least worst alternative on the market for carrying memory cards.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is this is something you would expect to see at the dollar store, but unfortunately they don't carry them there yet and it wasn't a dollar.<br /><br />The cards do slide in fine, but there is no \\"click\\" or locking mechanism to retain the card. It is more of a friction bar that keeps the card from coming out. It's not impossible for the card to find its way out of the holder, while it does seem to stay in fairly well, I wouldn't would wear it out in the open and expect your card is completely safe and secure from possible ejection.<br /><br />Considering the size, VS how many cards it actually holds, you are much better off using a factory case that came with a micro SD card and adapter then the Dimecard holder. With those factory type cases, I can carry 1 SD card adapter and 4 micro SD cards without any modification to the case. They are also half the size of the Dimecard holder and they are free. The Dimecard holder will hold 2 SD adapters and 6 micro SD cards, but for $8, REALLY?<br /><br />Honestly your far and away much better off using a factory case or an Altoids smalls tin for your memory storage then the Dimecard solution.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in this product. I now understand why the positive reviews of this item on YouTube were done by people whom were given this item free of charge to do a review. I still would not give this product 5 stars if it were a dollar or even free.<br /><br />This is definitely not one of those times where you get what you pay for.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|We watched via video streaming through Amazon Prime free....It was full of action and had good parable funny spots re Swartzenager (ph), i.e., re terminate(or)...&#34;I'll be back,&#34;  &#34;Lone Wolf,&#34; &#34;Willis - took the &#34;I'll be back....&#34;you're not the only one that gets to say that,&#34; to Swartzebager (ph).  We enjoyed it, as we took the shot 'em up and blow 'em up as acting/special effects.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I am in love with this soundtrack, perfect renditions of classic Beatles songs.  The cast can really sing and it’s the perfect driving to work sound track.<br /><br />I only wish &#34;I want you/Heavy&#34; was on the soundtrack.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|If you've seen (and barely heard) the version that's on Netflix, this is almost like a new movie. While one can barely understand what's being said in the Netflix version, the audio here is crisp and the dialogue perfectly clear. The picture is far superior as well. For a film this beautifully shot, this version is a must. The contrast is dramatically improved and the colors are much more vibrant.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was great!! I highly recommend it! From start to finish, I found myself being draw into the world of the forgotten garden. Wow!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a wonderful book. It was insiripational and a tear jerker. I believe this book is a great read for both adults and teenagers. It is interesting to read about the way these teens were portrayed to have coped with having cancer and the symbolism behind their thoughts and actions.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great story, brilliant acting, beautiful camera work. This engrossing short series keeps you waiting for the next episode to see how the mystery will unfold and how the quirky characters will develop their relationships.
B009NY43NY|4.0|It was a good last book for the Sookie Stackhouse series. However, I felt as if it could have left with a little more of a cliff hanger to allow the readers to come to their own conclusions on how it can end for Sookie. It was a happy ending it seemed it needed maybe a little more drama. Dispite the negative comments, it was an overall good book, and i would recommend it to others. I would recommend the whole series to others.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|Was skeptical about any scanner under a hundred bucks, but am pleasantly surprised with results. Auto functions for color and exposure are good and manual adjustments are user friendly. Slides really benefit from good dust removal, but I am sure that is true for all scanners. I am happy with purchase.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an excellent book. the author has you guessing every step of the way. It has great twists and I think the whole book is nothing you expect as you read it. Definetly a good read and an intense read!
B00992CF6W|2.0|I love minecraft don't get me wrong but I have a kindle fire HD and it was the only game I had and it kept crashing my kindle and several times it would not turn on for a long time it made me sad I couldn't play my favorite game :`(
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack fits all my photography stuff!  It holds my Canon 60D, three lenses, flash, battery charger, batteries, a couple of photography books.  It seems to be well made and durable, I expect it to last a long time.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Well written with a story line that all readers can understand. The relationship of people who have shared an experience which shaped the lives.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|admittingly- I only made it through the first 15 minutes of this film- it's all that I could stand. it's as silly as it gets with far fetched action scenes and a ridiculous premise. I found a dozen holes within the premise of the movie storyline in the first 15 minutes and decided this movie is for people who can't think  deeper than a dixie cup. This movie is just pure dumbness.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Makes you think about the hidden clues! I would recommend this game and its free app. I have trouble putting this game down.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is great.  I knit and often save patterns to my computer as PDFs.  Now I can transfer the pattern I'm working on and have it with me whenever I want.  Much easier to bring my beautiful Fire than my laptop.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really like this game! I love hatching new dragons and they are so cute!  :-3 I also like doing the races on the race track.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am math-challenged, and to find such an easy program is such a blessing!  It does everything that I need..
0689835604|5.0|Excellent book. Great gift for a little baby/toddler. It's such a cute flip Ann discover book. I love these type of books.
B000FC0SIM|3.0|I found this book  funny  at times.  I like it as a memoir, but shows  little  instruction on how to be a writer.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Not very happy with this, I thought it was a step in getting Candy Crush for my kindle, I can't seem to find the game for my kindle!!!
B00BE97ONM|5.0|I'm very glad I took a chance on this book.  Roses uses short chapters to keep the story moving at a lightning pace, putting the thrill into this thriller/murder mystery.  The story is dark, twisted, and full of blood, so if you aren't looking for a fairytale ending, this may be the book for you!  I definitely recommend it!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|This is a new author for me, and I really enjoyed this book. I literally could not put it down and am looking forward to more in the series. Highly recommend.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Hours and hours of fun and some very challenging levels. Although stuck on one particular level as I can't find the one missing 'fruit' to complete the special requirement to unlock the final bonus level. Still very enjoyable though.
B000EXZI14|5.0|I watched a showing of the One Night Only concert on a public TV station recently and my love for the BEEGEES was rekindled. This recording is very enjoyable and includes all of my favorite songs by this group.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Fantastic ending to an incredible story! The twists and turns near the end, wrench your heart and make you shout with joy!
B000MCIBE8|2.0|I should have read more carefully - this is not the original album and I think it sounds a little too scratchy.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Often good books don’t survive the transition to film, at least not without suffering major casualties to its contents.  Warm Bodies made it with remarkable adherence to the original material and was able to smooth over the parts that had to be cut for filming convenience. There’s multiple storylines that had to be removed which is a little sad but they set it up so that the core of the book holds true and is handled well.<br />The acting is good, visuals and costumes match well and over-all it’s definitely a movie to see at least once.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Omg is literally all i can say about this book. Koodos to you John Green because your novel really touched my heart. Everything from the characters to the plot is perfect. Thanks for this book, it's taught me things I would have otherwise never realized.<br /><br />Your huge fan:))))<br />Izzy
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome!!! I loved every minute if it!! Anxiously awaiting season 4!! All of my friends are hooked!! Best show on TV!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|very happy and relaxed with this app. great selection and easy to use. I use it most nights to fall asleep; I set the auto turn off with timer and no worries about it draining my battery
B0016LTNL4|5.0|This was hilarious without being overly slapstick or ridiculous like Monty Python. Alan Tudyk, who is an American actor, did splendid job. Matthew MacFayden's dead pan delivery was precious.
1401937519|5.0|thank you thank you thank you.  I know nothing else to say to the Powers that be, within and without us.  If you're terrified of what is to be, or of where you are now, or that you will never again see or know or get to speak to your loved ones, and why why why! you must read this charming, delight, that actually drops you through Alice's \\"whole.\\"
B0015AARJI|1.0|the product advertising was VERY VERY MISSLEADING!!  long story short, the wireless controller WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE FOR MORE THAT 22 MINUTES!!  i now have to play with it PLUGGED into the ps3.  kinda defeats the purpose of having a WIRELESS CONTROLLER.  very dissappointed.
1883217040|4.0|This is a reference work for professional musicians and serious amateurs who need to understand the techniques and structures of jazz music.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Shows strengths and weaknesses of people irregardless  of position or power. Shows why a great country focused too much on doing things the same traditional way and became less competitive.
B000007XUQ|5.0|The music never grows old and brings back many memories from the past. Wish there were more talent like their's
B0027MJU00|4.0|I started reading Gillian Flynn's novels with Sharp Objects and am finally starting Gone Girl.  It's interesting to see how her writing develops throughout the three books. This book is dark and has twists as you progress through to discover the outcome. However, I didn't find it as dark as Sharp Objects, but it made for a very interesting read.
B0075564A8|5.0|Madonna Truth or Darr was  Spectacular & perfectly splendid! Very entertaining! A feast for the ears and eyes!  Madonna nostalgia at its best
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and loved all of the twists and turns that it takes.  It keeps you guessing the entire time and I was still shocked at the ending.  It was very entertaining and a great way to start reading Gillian Flynn's novels.  I have finally just made it to Gone Girl which I am incredibly excited about!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you like 100 rooms you will like this. It has an addicting quality about it. Takes the time away.<br /><br />If you liked 100 Rooms you'll like this. It is easy to follow yet keeps your interest. It also is addicting. takes the time away.
B00886XQO0|5.0|The headset is great. Very comfortable for wearing hours on end. Best part is I can link the bluetooth to my PC and switch to my xbox on the fly. Living in a barracks while deployed. These things are fantastic.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|this was a childhood favorite and i got to share this with my children...they absolutely loved it and keep fast forwarding to the singing every time they watch it.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Didn't know about Pam Grout, though she wrote a ton of books and propelled herself to success by using the access to Spirit exercises that are found in this breezy book. Having been around this subject area, reminds me of Lynn Grabhorn's books, though she departed the world too early. Many of these exercises are a compilation of other authors' insights and experiments. I am grateful to be reminded of some, like plant and water intelligence and communication. Others, I am not so sure of. Like the promises in The Secret, of the ways to get your heart's desire, the snappy writing in this book does not deliver. It's too simplistic for me. Keep a diary for whether The Universe responds to your requests, seems just too organized and non-inspirational. In conclusion, good primer but not the one that delivers the goods.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Another of the Jack Reacher series that are a joy to read.At times the plots seem to get a little thin but none the less I enjoy them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome I play with my brother<br />:)<br />lol<br />love this game<br />I post youtube videos adout<br /> it
B000GCFG7E|5.0|one of the more enjoyable of the series.Altho I have read all of this series some are a little more intense than others.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love this app. Love my little pony .  My favorite pony is Rainbow Dash. She is the best ever  Love love love
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child has a truly great format with this hero and I can only hope that he is able to continue with this series
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's a great app it's a lot like it online. I haven't had any of the other issues other people complained about. For me it loads quickly. I have a kindle not an HD or whatever the other models are. It works perfectly fine and I have had it on my kindle since Christmas day 2012. I haven't removed it has stayed on my kindle since I downloaded it.
030758836X|3.0|This book is written in three parts.  That's not a spoiler.<br /><br />Part one is dark and makes use of the unreliable narrator to great effect, leaving the reader guessing as to the motives and even accounts that the characters give, despite the first person structure.  Part one kept me up through the night turning pages.  It's amazing.<br /><br />Part two introduces a twist which I cannot elaborate on because it's a spoiler.  The problem with the twist is that it takes all the interest out of several secondary characters who, until then, were interesting only because you didn't know the twist.  Once you learn it, the secondary characters become drab window dressing on a conflict that has lost a lot of mystery.  The second part becomes more thriller than mystery, then it starts to drag because I stopped caring about the secondary characters:  Most of the action in part two is about the main plot, but most of the TEXT in part two is about the secondary characters' mostly-irrelevant actions.<br /><br />Part three is bizarre and hard to believe.  I would go as far as to recommend you stop after part two, imagine a few different endings, and then read part three.  The endings you can imagine would be dark and tragic or tense but triumphant; and nothing at all like what's actually written!  The real ending will surprise you.  In this case, that's not a good thing.  It's surprisingly unbelievable, and a little bit silly.  It's jarring comparing the weird and almost flippant part three with the somber and gritty part one.
0316010669|4.0|\\"Blink\\" is an excellent compilation of the psychological research into the science of snap judgments. It is filled with concrete examples of how our brains filter vast amounts of information to arrive at decisions in the blink of an eye. Often these occurrences have surprisingly positive results. Occasionally, sometimes in patterns of behavior, such decisions are biased, unwise or harmful. Malcom Gladwell does a fine job of examining many sides of this phenomenon. This book may be the first of its kind to aggregate so many independent studies and real-world examples. As is typical with first anythings, it triggers many thoughts and questions in one's mind, and you tend to want more information and further conclusions or \\"take-aways\\" as soon as you finish the book.<br /><br />The examples make clear that the research conducted in this area is substantial. True experts in facial recognition, for example, have an ability to read human emotion that is astronomically beyond the average person. In one example, two psychologists categorize the facial muscle movements we all use to express emotions. They developed a system to fundamentally recognize intentions from expressions. It reminds me of \\"The Machine\\" in the TV series \\"Person of Interest\\" that monitors security cameras worldwide to interpret crimes about to happen via the facial expressions of the people involved. Other examples of deep expertise include the quantitative analysis of married couples' relationships based on keyword or \\"key attitude\\" analysis and the finely detailed categorization of tastes by two food experts. All three of these examples show the rigor required to explain the basis for one's rapid cognition and the benefits, in terms of high-quality decisions, that result from acquiring such expertise. One may assume that only a few people in any field of endeavor hold such expertise making them extremely competitive and valuable. The resulting lesson for Blink readers, not stated in the book, is that specialization is essential; otherwise, proceed with caution.<br /><br />The discussion about human instinctive reactions is just enough to pique interest without going deep enough to be satisfying. Examples from the book are basketball player Larry Byrd's slow-motion vision of fast play and a policeman's tunnel vision in life-or-death confrontation. Other types of instinctive reactions are not discussed (e.g. touching a hot stove; lightning-fast retreat upon encountering a snake face-to-face; a baby's startle reaction). The majority of Gladwell's examples relate to behaviors distilled to their essence from experience combined with an individual's natural talents. I suspect there is some degree of overlap or interplay between experience and instinct and would like to learn more about it.<br /><br />I rate this book four stars. It is worth reading for the interesting examples, yet leaves a something to be desired in the area of weaving the examples together into a coherent framework and drawing useful conclusions.specialization is essential; otherwise, proceed with caution.<br /><br />The discussion about human instinctive reactions is just enough to pique interest without going deep enough to be satisfying.

B009JZWYKQ|1.0|Waste of time for me - although it was highly recommended.  Started bad, and went to worse half way through
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|This is a fun book for just about everybody! I loved the photos and funny captions, and the puzzles and games were fun too. I found this book hilarious!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I just upgraded my CPU for a core i3 to the i5 3570k.  This thing is amazing.  In tandem with my new graphics card all of my games are running great now.  I really can't recommend this CPU enough.  Great reliability.  Great features.  A tad pricy, but here you get what you pay for
B0010SEMP0|5.0|A suspenseful, creative and enjoyable book.  The characters are well- developed and interesting. I was unable to put it down!
0385343175|5.0|Another great Danielle Steel read.  Loved it from page 1.  Get it you will not be able to put it down
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|First half is a total sleeper.  Second half speeds up a bit but could not keep my attention.  Wish I could say something more positive because I luv sci-fi.  Certainly sorry I bought the Blu Ray...next time I'll watch on Amazon Download and save my extra money for a worthwhile show.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Once you start playing you cannot stop.  I find it cute and entertaining and you can never get enough of the minions
1858707536|5.0|This is a longer, newly recorded version of journey.  A beautiful prog rock trip for old fans and newcomers too.  The audio is far superior to the first version., so many years later, and includes new segments of music, a few other musicians, excellent production.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This is quite possibly the buggiest game I've ever downloaded for my kindle. It took three tries to get it to load then it kept freezing up and then crashing. The music for this game kept playing long after it had crashed. Also, when I could play, the objects in the room were just too small or the clue was very vague. It lasted less than five minutes before I removed it from my device.
B00DBISUWS|5.0|Tales of Us reminds me of Felt Mountain, which was by far their best release.  The music is haunting, well orchestrated, and transports the listener to another realm.  Each song tells a separate story but the album is meant to be listened to as a whole.  Good introduction for new fans as well as a nice reminder to longtime fans as to why we fell in love with Goldfrapp in the first place.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|If you like formula one, car racing, sports and plain old inspiring stories, you'll love this documentary. Senna is not only the best car racer to set foot on this planet, he is also such an incredible person with such a tragic ending. This movie will clearly show why.
0446699616|2.0|Seriously, I have never come across a protagonist built so completely from wisecracks.  Some of them were funny the first or second time, but not the 3rd, 13th, 23rd, or 33rd...(seriously).  I picked this book up at the store because I recall really enjoying The Gold Coast which I read many years ago.  Either I have become a more discerning reader, or DeMille a worse writer.  I think it is mostly the latter--at least in terms of this book.  Flat characters, flat plot development, and very slow-moving for an exotically set would-be spy thriller.  By comparison, the middle section of Tom Rob Smith's Agent 6, where we find ex-KGB protagonist Leo Demidov in Afghanistan amongst the rebels, is so much more vivid, and compelling, and real.  Finally, this book is just so jingoistic.  The message really seems to be that we'd almost do best just to nuke Yemen (at least large parts of it), but for the pesky PCers who stand in our way, and that, at the very least, any \\"collateral damage\\" in the war on terrorism is acceptable.  This message is conveyed in part because there is not a single Yemeni in the book who is developed as a flesh-and-blood character with any redeeming traits.  Pass the Cipro.
B00E3D7WGU|1.0|Loved the live concert and Madonna but the DVD sound and production quality is terrible.  You can't appreciate the great show that Madonna created with all the slow motion scenes and changing video clips every 3 seconds.  Very disappointed.  :(
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New verison is VERY disappointing.  Difficult to read current weather because of background photo.  Also difficult to navigate between screens.  New verison keeps crashing my Kindle.  Former verison worked fine and I looked to it all the time for the weather forecast. Finally had to uninstall.  Hope Weather Channel corrects these problems.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. It is very addictive. You can spend a lot of time playing this game. I just wish you could build more land.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was intrigued from the start. Now that I finished  this book I know I need to get the rest. I recommend this series.

B001NEK2GE|3.0|Normally I write reviews for the majority, this is a bit of a head-scratcher.<br /><br />Background - I game lightly. I had my WoW days and my LoL days but those have passed and now I just doddle around in Minecraft a little and play a few smurfy games of LoL here and there, and I throw in some BG2:SoA when I'm feeling nostalgic. That being said, these games could benefit from a good game pad. I was particularly excited to forgo WASD movement in Minecraft in favor of joystick movement and leave all those other fingers to roam free over glorious hotkeys and macros.<br /><br />The short version: It's well-built, pretty, the software is great, and the extra-long thumb/pinky keys are a nice thought, but using the joystick puts your thumb at a really awkward angle and there are no keys above the WASD-equivalent keys on the pad. This leaves your left hand with less functionality than it would have on a standard keyboard, so I always end up moving that hand back to my keyboard.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-More keys for your left thumb<br />-More keys for your left ring finger<br />-All keys are programmable<br />-Eye candy<br />-Versatile LCD display<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Awkward and uncomfortable joystick<br />-No row of keys above your WASD fingers<br />-Limited functionality over a standard keyboard, unless you're big into complex key bindings<br />-Membrane<br /><br />The long version:<br /><br />First, the joystick. I love the idea of using that left thumb for WASD movement (or camera movement in LoL) and freeing up your middle three fingers exclusively for hotkeys. Unfortunately, trying to use it with your thumb (or at least my thumb; maybe my thumbs are strange) is really uncomfortable. Even if it was comfortable, it's very difficult to feel which direction is \\"up\\", limiting accuracy. Throwing out the joystick, we're left using the G4, G10, G11, and G12 keys as WASD, which is fine I suppose, but you need to think at this point how much the G13 is really doing for you beyond your standard keyboard.<br /><br />My biggest gripe (I know, gripe gripe grumble grumble) after forgetting about the joystick is that with your hand in the WASD position on the G13 there are no keys above your fingers - where you would find the number keys on a standard keyboard. The trade-offs here are that your thumb has many more options, whereas it's really only positioned to press the spacebar on a normal keyboard, and you can stretch your ring finger left to find more hotkeys where you'd find capslock normally. But losing those number keys is a big deal, and it's questionable whether the trade-offs are worth it. It was at this point that I started to realize I had paid however much money for a device that was questionably more useful than what I already had. It doesn't help that my G710+ has wonderful cherry browns while the G13 is membrane.<br /><br />The screen on the G13 is very nice. When it loads my LoL profile, minion kills, money earned, k/d etc show up on the screen for quick info which is kinda cool. It'll also do computer performance monitoring and the like - and if you're a competent programmer you can make it do pretty much anything you want. The screen is small, however, and too far below my monitors for quick glances and isn't quite useful enough to justify the purchase.<br /><br />It's worth noting that every G13 key can be programmed to do a bunch of different things, whereas you can usually only map standard keyboard keys from one character to another in-game. This would doubtless be very useful to some gamers, but I don't personally have enough need for complex macros and the like to put them right under my hand; if I need them I stretch my pinky over to the G710+'s 6 G-keys. But if this review was about how useful I personally find the G13 it would be more like two stars; the mediocre review score takes into account the things that I'm sure other people would find useful.<br /><br />So there you go, as a very light gamer it doesn't giveme the things I really want which are a full keyset under the entire range of my left hand and an ergonomic joystick. Take this with a grain of salt if you're deep into WoW and need complex key combinations and macros at all of your fingertips.<br /><br /></grumble>
0062255657|4.0|Ever since I learned about the Guinea worm from a middle school textbook I have been both obsessed and horrified by the idea of such a creature, which is why, to me, this story seems extra scary. It is about a man in his forties who returns to the area where he grew up and visits the neighbors. Doing so brings back memories of frightful, unsettling events that took place when he was a boy of seven and the neighbor girl, Lettie Hempstock, was a girl of eleven. To those who've read Neil Gaiman before, the fact that the story is rather odd will come as no surprise. It involves strange happenings on the Hempstock land where otherworldly creatures appear, dreams get mixed up with reality, and the laws of physics are defied. Simply along for the ride, the boy gets caught up in the weirdness when he does not completely follow Lettie's instructions about what to do in a certain situation. Most of the rest involves the Hempstocks' attempts to keep the boy safe and rid their world of the evil entities, which, of course, doesn't go quite as planned. Best of the book: its strangeness. Also good: A Tale for the Time-Being by Ruth Ozeki, His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman and The Book of Lost Things by John Connolly.
B008554242|5.0|A great book for any one with a camera. I am a semi-pro and use it as a teaching tool

B007ZMAL32|5.0|Sabaton is bloody awesome! Hopefully one day they will create a metal album about the Seven Years war and the American Revolution! That would be epic!
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Just received this. Super disappointed in the extras and the intensely stupid distribution of said extras. Wish I'd read about the issue before it was too late to cancel the pre-order.  Do yourself a favor and look that up before you buy.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Does what is says it does.  Nice design, good interface, very handy.  It isn't like you can't already do all this with the stock phone, but the controls on this app are much easier to work.  the app does it's job and gets out of the way, or you can leave it up if you like the meters.
0385341008|5.0|Wonderful novel that shows how people overcome their bad feelings toward a society and learn to love an individual!  Loved it!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This is a stellar show, and I love that I can watch it on amazon with my Prime membership. Awesome!
0446555002|5.0|Just starting to read this latest book but appears to be just as great as the rest of the series.

1118488768|5.0|At the time of the 11/6/12 election, the Obama Facebook page had 32 million 'Likes' vs. Romney's 12 million. Obama's Twitter feed at the time had 22.8 million followers, vs. Romney's 1.7 million. Scott's implicit point - this had to have a significant impact on a relatively close election.<br /><br />Scott claims the book has sold well in previous versions for about six years - even hitting the BusinessWeek best-seller list, without his spending any advertising or promotion funds. Instead, Scott sent advance editions to about 130 bloggers, sent out nearly 20 news releases, and his publisher alerted media contacts.<br /><br />The web now provides opportunity to reach niche buyers directly with targeted information that costs a fraction of big-budget traditional advertising. The old approach focused on interrupting people to get their attention so they would pay attention to a one-way message. The new approach starts with those already interested and wanting to learn more.<br /><br />Ways to increase site traffic include adding interesting information - eg. a link to the Grammar Girl podcast and/or site, trivia questions. Instead of just hyping your product and services at the time of new developments, make news releases regularly, place links in those releases (eg. football results, band performances, Onion comedy, student-club projects, donating your product to those in need - Oakley sunglasses to the Chilean miners rescued after several weeks) to deliver potential customers to pages on your website.<br /><br />Building your marketing/PR plan: First, determine your business goals, identify buyer personas and what they want, and what you want them to believe about your organization/product.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This was the first book I have read from Malcolm Gladwell, I previewed a lot of it in a book store and found it fascinating. The main premise of the book is that the most successful are not successful only because of hard work, though that is part of it; they also tend to have had great luck in getting experience (or, more specifically, the opportunity to get a lot of practice). The examples he gives are fascinating and I fond quite a bit too highlight. As some of the reviews have said, it makes you think; mainly, obviously to look at success as dependent on circumstances, but also to realize that most people have the potential to be immensely successful, as long as they are in the right place at the right time, regardless of their IQ.
B00011D1OA|5.0|When my wife told me My Fair Lady was her favorite movie, I cringed.  I wasn't really interested in watching an Audrey Hepburn movie.  I had seen Pygmalion (1938) while I was in high school and knew this was a musical version of it.  I liked it, though I was content with that single viewing.  But when I saw my wife light up as she talked about how she wished we owned a copy, I went ahead and ordered My Fair Lady, along with Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, as part of her anniversary gift.<br /><br />I have to admit this was one of the funniest movies I have seen.  Alfred P. Doolittle has to be my favorite character in the whole movie.  His songs and scenes had me rolling.  I have since watched it with my kids and they have come to love it, as well.  Definitely worth the money and a great family movie to boot.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|It was lively and colorful however, I didn't understand the rules and could not figure out how to turn off the music.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|One of my absolute favorites of all time.  Now - on to the series!  Just wish the series had kept the original Daniel.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is addicting, but is kind of annoying with all of the prompting to post your status on Facebook. A lot of fun overall, though.
B009CCBCU4|2.0|This book was slow poorly written and boring.  I read about a third before I stopped reading.  It is great if you want to go to sleep in a hurry.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book gets inside your head and exposes why you do what you do, but best of all it inspires you to create new habits.<br />This book also gives great insights into how marketing and and our habits are studied. A very informative look inside the world of habits.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is an amazing app or book. I can find all the words and abbreviations I need. Thank God that it came with the kindle fire.
1451626096|4.0|I love Phillipa Gregory's view point of a very colorful time in history.  The Tudor family became well known in England and interesting to see how that came about.
B00CE6E6B2|5.0|I love this game. You level up fast I've been playing it for about a week and I'm at level 22 already. You get neighbors without having to ask for them. You don't have to use actual money to advance or to get the neat stuff. I've tried many games of all kinds and this so far has been my favorite I have a hard time putting it down. I play it on my Kindle Fire HD and it plays great. I recommend this game highly. Great job to the makers.
1451626088|4.0|I love Phillipa Gregory's view point of a very colorful time in history.  A different viewpoint on the events of that time period.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was unable after many attempts to set up the Chromecast I purchased so never was able to use it.  I tried with two different wireless networks and an iPhone and iPad.  The error messages conveyed no information about the problem(s) or how to fix.  I returned the unit to Amazon.
B000QCS9NM|5.0|This book took me by surprise.  I went in expecting something much darker, but what I got was a very strange love story full of black humor and philosophical insight.  But it turns out, that's what I'd really been looking for all along.
B0006OBPTA|2.0|This 3-disc set contains 4 Karate Kid films. All four films are in widescreen format. These were the feel-good movies of the 1980's. The first two films are available on Blu-ray now but this is the only set to contain the quadrilogy (the 2010 remake is not included). The Next Karate Kid wasn't quite as good though it did have Mr. Miyagi returning to coach a young girl. The picture and audio quality in this set is fairly good. The problem is that there aren't many extras overall (less than 2 hours) and none of the sequels get any treatment. If you own the original film already you aren't getting any added value here. Ultimately, this is the economy set for KK fans who want the quadrilogy in one set because the price is right. If you are only interested in the original you may consider purchasing it separately on the 2010 stand-alone Blu-ray (with the same extras included here). Those interested in at least two of the sequels will get their money's worth. The Karate Kid franchise deserves a deluxe Blu-ray with 6 hours of bonus supplements. These are 4 star films in a skimpy 2 star package.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />\\"Beyond the Form\\" Featurette, Commentary with Director John G. Avildsen, Writer Robert Mark Kamen and Actors Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita, \\"East Meets West: A Composer's Notebook\\", \\"Life of Bonsai\\" Featurette, \\"The Way of the Karate Kid\\" Multi-Part \\"Making of\\" Featurette
B00DV3A84G|3.0|I loved the music, but the CD case arrived cracked in the padded envelope. CD was ok, so I didn't bother returning it.
B0037QGRZG|4.0|Great feel-good movie about a guy dealing with the pressures of growing up. Ralph Macchio is perfect as the apprentice who must avoid bullies, pursue his dream girl and of course learn karate. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi are forever etched in the minds of Americans who watched the film in the 1980's. We watched the trilogy dozens of times and still enjoy it. The picture and audio quality are very good on this Blu-ray. The special features from the DVD are all here (there is over an hour of total bonus content).<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Audio Commentary<br />The Way of the Karate Kid: Part 1 (SD, 24 min)<br />The Way of the Karate Kid: Part 2 (SD, 21 min)<br />Beyond the Form (SD, 13 min)<br />East Meets West: A Composer's Notebook (SD, 8 min)<br />Life of Bonsai (SD, 10 min)<br />Trailers(HD) - The collection includes previews for 'Hachi: A Dog's Tale,' 'Extraordinary Measures,' 'Facing the Giants,' and 'The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep.'<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray. Some of the sequels are available on Blu-ray as well.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Okay first off, this game is not like skyrim. This game is like a level based crappy version of diablo III. Controls are very shoddy, ranged attacks are horrible, and also the game doesn't let you change the UI or zoom out. The only upside are the graphics. I give this game a 60%.
B0021L9MJG|3.0|Creepshow is a great horror anthology brought to you by two legends: George A. Romero and Stephen King. It sports an impressive cast in a very enjoyable collection of stories. Don't listen to the haters talk about the transfer quality. The picture and audio are an improvement from the DVD. They aren't great but there are no major issues with either of them. The main problem is that we get nothing in bonus content except the trailer. The UK 2-disc Special Edition had a commentary track by Romero, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and the very excellent 90-minute documentary entitled &#34;Just Desserts: The Making of 'Creepshow'&#34;. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star release so not all fans will want to upgrade. The sequel is sold separately on Blu-ray and rates just slightly lower (The Raft segment is worth watching). For this release, I have rated the segments in Creepshow individually below. I did find them scary when the movie was released but must admit they are entertaining but not horrific now.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/VC-1   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English Dolby TrueHD 2.0 Surround<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French Subtitles<br />Special Features: Theatrical Trailer (SD)<br /><br />B: Father's Day - It doesn't pick up until halfway through but it is enjoyable.<br />C: Meteor - Stephen King in a rare acting role. It is fairly average but the dark ending is creepy.<br />A: Hold Your Breath - Ted Danson and Leslie Nielsen square off over a lady. Danson and Nielsen aren't comedic here and it works well.<br />A+: The Crate - This is the best segment. Just the right balance of suspense and great acting. You want to see the wife die.<br />C+: Cockroaches - E.G. Marshall does a good job but this segment can drag if you watch it more than once.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read other DeMille books previously. This one is OK, but I did not find it as strong as his other books. One review I read faulted the book for including too much historical information about Yemen. I actually thought that that aspect of the book was one of its STRONG features. I enjoyed those sections. I was distressed, however, about the many essentialist comments about Arabs. Surely they are not all dishonest ruthless killers with no conscience. There is a colonialist attitude conveying a smug superiority about the West that disturbed me. The protagonist's witty reflections were often very funny, but I found that the writing style, in which these comments were inserted after almost every paragraph, became tiresome after awhile.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|This is a  weaker film than the first -- a flashy but, especially through its long middle section, rather flaccid offering that would have benefited from a 30- or 40-minute edit.<br /><br />That said, it does right itself in the last 45 minutes -- in itself an unusual event for any off-course movie -- and winds up being bland, general-purpose fun in the same way I imagine water parks are fun on a hot day.<br /><br />I could quibble about the anonymous design of the action scenes (a template seen in far too many films lately), the writing -- moral considerations seem to have been doctored into a number of dialogs -- and overly glitzy production design. But my enduring caveat is that \\"Into Darkness\\" displays sadly little respect for the franchise's rich history.<br /><br />Granted, the first Abrams film didn't either, but it got away with it  more effectively owing to the alternate-timeline plot. Here, \\"Star Trek\\" seems little more than a framework and set of characters to be drawn upon at will, irrespective of events in the original series and the earlier films, and less \\"reboot\\" than reinvention.<br /><br />I can't expand upon this assertion without getting into spoilers, but, in the main, it comes down to the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the chief villain.<br />He is less than effective. I don't blame the actor. Cumberbatch did his best with what he was given -- and he does have one especially resonant scene -- but he was badly miscast in this particular part and for the worst Hollywood sorts of reasons. He should have had weight, and he has none. I wasn't intimidated by his character. I wasn't even interested in him. Heck, I couldn't even identify him without the film telling me who he is.<br /><br />And I should have been able to do so. His first closeup should have been one of those moments where all Star Trek fans draw in their breath and hold it for a second or two.<br /><br />Then, at least, the film would have had one such moment.ad one such moment.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book! My daughter recommended it. I'm halfway through in 2 days. I don't want to oversimplify but it reads like a sci-fi Harry Potter to me. I will definitely read the whole series.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It came in the mail, I plugged it into an HDMI port on my flat screen, plugged in the power cord, downloaded the appropriate apps through my iPhone and voila! Wow! The Chromecast installed very easily with info from it's website and on line prompts. I found that it works perfectly with both Utube videos and Netflix movies that, on the large flat screen tv, are excellent. It's WiFi, no cables, wow.<br /><br />I made a point of playing some Disney videos from Utube, for my granddaughter, and movies from Netflix, too. This Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player performed perfectly. Very useful for me viewing instructionals, too. And can't wait to see what else I'll be able to use it with.<br /><br />An Incredibly useful device, and for $35., it can't be beat.
B0014CDKVY|4.0|Excellent movie. Great story line and superb acting. The only downside is that the zombies look too cartoonish. Other than that, a great thriller.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Yeah, 5-stars, and worth every one of them. Not sure why some other reviewers complained about the weight of this thing, 'cause it's not heavy. It is, however, extremely well made. Quality parts weigh more, but Wenger has designed this pack so well that every ounce, and we are talking about ounces here, is well worth it.<br /><br />My previous pack was exceptionally light, and after two semesters of school, only eight weeks with an Algebra tome, it tore itself apart. This pack, on the other hand, looks like I could carry a short block V8 in it with nary a care in the world. Seriously, I wouldn't think twice about loading this thing to 60 lbs.<br /><br />Attention to detail is perfect.  Love the straps; they're so comfortable, and adjusting them while wearing it is so easy, I was laughing the first time I tried it. My old pack demanded I take it off to change strap length.<br /><br />The laptop sleeve is a thing of beauty. It swallowed my 17&#34; Mac without trouble, and it is so well protected that I have no qualms about traveling with it like this, saving me a precious carry-on slot.<br /><br />The zippers are so awesome. They seem like, with proper care, they will outlive me. The pull tabs for them are just another small detail that was not overlooked. Ergonomic and tough...nicely done. They are a joy to use.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good, cheap pack, Jansport is a fine choice. But, if you're looking for something to last forever, this is the one.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This saga is easily the best western of all time.  Robert Duvall & Tommy Lee Jones took me back to my childhood (in the 50s) to make me love westerns again!  I dont have the words to explain how involved I got with the charters and the stories they each had to tell & they told it in grand fashion.  I will enjoy this film again & again. My copy was in excellent shape.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I wish I had this prior to writing my first book.  A must have! Anyone even considering writing any type of book should read this first.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I'll admit I purchased the CD due to all the airplay of the song \\"Radioactive\\".  Then I sat down and listened to the entire CD and realized that there was much more to this group than \\"Radioactive\\".  Honestly, my favorite songs have to be \\"Demons\\" and \\"On Top Of The World\\".  There are a couple of songs on the album (shows my age) that I really don't care much for, which is why I'll give this a 4 star instead of 5 star.  Overall, an album I'm glad I went out and purchased.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game I will play it all the time my mom has to bug me to do something with my sisters. point is it is fun there are creapers ,zombies, spiders and so much more get the game now .
B001SGEUNI|5.0|i bought this item because i have the next album, and liked it so much i searched to see if there was more out there. i like this one just as much.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far I enjoy this very much and would gladly recommend to other people who would like seek and find puzzles.
B000002L80|5.0|\\"Little Creatures\\" by Talking Heads was by the far their breeziest album. This album was released in 1985 when pop music was at its most popular. And so \\"Little Creatures\\" is a fun, perky, loopy pop album - Talking Heads style of course. David Byrne's lyrics are still mind-bending as ever. His vocals are unique as always, and even when he sounds really sarcastic, he has this uncanny ability to come off really sincere. There's a lot of love songs on this record. You can tell Byrne was in love with someone when he recorded this album, his songwriting is very romantic which is evident on \\"Creatures of Love\\" and \\"The Lady Don't Mind\\" which is easily my favorite song. \\"The Lady Don't Mind\\" is about unrequited love, the melody flows wonderfully and the chorus is bittersweet. \\"Creatures of Love\\" feels like an alt-country song. The song is a little corny but the message is timeless. He talks about the meaning of life, and how we should all hold our loved ones close to our heart. There are some silly, fun moments on this album like the underrated gem, \\"Stay Up Late\\" and the confusing but irresistible \\"Television Man\\". I have no idea what the inspiration was behind \\"Television Man\\" but I know that I like it and it makes me smile. The moodiest song is \\"Give Me Back My Name\\". I read from other reviews this song is about death, the lyrics are dark and morbid: \\"Some things can never be spoken, some things cannot be pronounced. That word does not exist in any language, it will never uttered by a human mouth...\\" I also enjoy \\"Perfect World\\" and \\"Walk it Down\\" which have strong choruses and I feel like the pop sound really comes alive during these 2 tracks, and you can't help but sing along. The first single that was released from \\"Little Creatures\\" was \\"And She Was\\" which is the very first Talking Heads song I remember hearing on the radio when I was a kid. Of course at the time, I just thought \\"And She Was\\" was a love song, but when I grew up - I discovered that the song is about a girl tripping on a mind-altering substance: \\"And she was looking at herself, and things were looking like a movie. She had a pleasant elevation, she's moving out in all directions...\\" And the 2nd single, \\"Road to Nowhere\\" which is the perfect song to end the album on. I feel like this is the bands best song on \\"Little Creatures\\". It's a sweeping epic backed by gorgeous, flawless harmonies, and the sound is big and glorious. Towards the end of the song, Byrne's vocals become loud and rambunctious - it always makes me laugh because it's such an unexpected, awkward moment. The song is poetic even though the lyrics have a hint of pessimism in them because life is a never-ending journey. For some people it's an exhilarating ride, and for others it's an endless struggle. Talking Heads were one of the best and most experimental bands of the '70s and '80s. Even though the band broke-up 2 albums later after \\"Little Creatures\\" their incredible music lives on. If you like weird new wave/pop/funk music then Talking Heads is the band for you. Enjoy.a girl tripping on a mind-altering substance: \\"And she was looking at herself, and things were looking like a movie.

B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game starts out simple, you think oh this is so easy but it gets harder to clear the patch.  It is a good way to relax and clear your mind.
B006LG7O38|3.0|I watched the original. It was alright back then but Colin plays a much more menacing and frightening vampire. Also..the teenagers look and act like teenagers in this version! *Spoiler Alert* Watch for the cameo from the original &#34;Jerry&#34;
B003G4W49C|4.0|I have to admit that I found the introduction more provocative than the book,  but the two together really stirred up alot of memories.  I am the daughter of a WWII vet who also served in Korea.  I asked my dad many times about his experiences of war and he always evaded an answer.  I now have a better understanding of why, especially since he was a fighter pilot and did express once of how he couldn't think about the damage he was inflicting, only to get his job done.
0143038419|5.0|It has always amazed me how so many people come out of a difficult relationship or marriage whether it be angry, hurt, depressed, etc. only to do more damage to themselves. More or less jumping from one frying pan to another. The author of this book worked thorough a painful divorce w/o hurting HERSELF. I recommend getting the book and hopefully it will help you to heal from a broken relationship, whatever the case, w/o hurting yourself.
B005HEF8OC|5.0|Thanks Amazon Prime for including this among the free TV series.  I hadn't seen Star Trek: Enterprise since it got cancelled.  Not only was the character development great, but it really conveyed a sense of vulnerability and hope among the early explorers.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|What's there not to like about a Twitter app? The app works fine on my Kindle Fire and if anyone wants to download it, go for it:-)
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have been using an Apple TV for several months at both home and my office. At home it's mostly for picture viewing, streaming video, a bit of web browsing and mostly music. At the office we use it to allow visitors and staff the ability to quickly connect to our projectors and sound systems. Apple TV excels at these functions but I was excited to hear about Google's Chromecast because there are some things that Apple TV blocks - streaming Amazon videos being the main one. After using Chromecast for a few days now I make the following observations:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Cheaper than Apple TV<br />Battery consumption on your phone/tablet is minimal as the device pulls content from the Cloud rather than your device<br />VERY easy config, though the Apple TV is just as easy<br />Compact package though I had to use the power cord it ships with as my Sound Bar did not supply enough power via HDMI<br /><br />Cons:<br />Works with a limited number of services<br />You cannot mirror your screen as you can with Apple TV<br /><br />Overall the Chromecast is useful if you are going to be streaming media from one of the supported services. If you want to share other content such as pictures, mp3's, presentations, spreadsheets, etc this is not going to be the right device for you. Overall I would recommend that iOS users (iphone, ipad) purchase an Apple TV rather than a Chromecast as you will be able to perform a much wider variety of functions with that.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|This Kindle Fire sleeve is so lightweight and easy to carry; and it almost looks like I have a clutch bag when I'm using it to take my Kindle Fire with me. I would recommend this item to anyone. I got the coral and it is soooooo cute:-)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great so far. Enjoying the mystery. Can't wait to see what happens at the end.. wonder what is going to happen
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The Facebook app works fine on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend this app to anyone that desires to download it on theirs.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Very cleverly woven story with incredibly imaginative imagery, taking one beyond the main storyline thru many different vignettes each with their own story. Intriguing!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie. I got it to show my students for their end of the year party. They loved it enough that I bought it.
B002WN35DC|1.0|This version really sucks because IT DO NOT HAVE THE ILLUSTRATIONS! And without them the book is useless I want my money back.
B000002KHF|5.0|Simply wanted to replace a classic that I had lost. I know you can pick it up on itunes, but i like having the CD in my collection.
B00CL8D83U|3.0|Good album, but somewhat different than their earlier work. Can't wait to see them on their latest tour this year.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|My husband & I really enjoy this show.  It's a decent sci-fi plus it is not just about the fighting & killing. It's about the people working together to survive as well.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I love bingo blitz but it is so frustrating waiting and waiting for the kindle update version to come through! Everyone is done by the time I catch up!
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I think, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is going to be big hit.  Bringing Agent Coulson back is smart and awesome!
B008Q09K2U|3.0|Am an avid fan of Nelson but some of his earlier books leave this in their wake . Still , his one liners are fantastic and will eagerly await his next thriller .<br />Especially remember &#34; Up Country &#34; , &#34; The General's Daughter &#34; and &#34; Charm School &#34;<br />Long live Nelson .<br />DW
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This is the third Harry Hole novel I've read. It is my favorite so far. The killer is scary smart and very elusive. Nesbo is becoming my favorite crime writer. Nightmares are on the way if you are up the reading this one. Now it's on to the Leopard for me, I'm going right through this series and awaiting Nesbo latest Harry Hole.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game; play it every day to pass time on commute to/from work. Recommend this for everyone -kids and adults!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like all the different features and the stock music. I really like the weather addition. I would buy this again if needed.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I haven't seen anything like this before and learned a lot from each episode. Each character lived the role to its best. A must watch TV serial.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|You don't have to be under 20 to enjoy Bruno Mars.  I'm 51 and can't get enough of this CD!  If you like even one song of his you hear on the radio, you will love this entire CD.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Love Neil Gaiman. Couldn't put it down. Disappointingly short though.<br /><br />Book too short e-book price, in my opinion, but still recommend if you like Gaiman.
1612930425|5.0|This is 2013 and I have recently read Pride and Prejudice for the first time.  A time-less tale -- it could have been written today.  The characters are as real as people you know today.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|THIS IS A VERY ADDICTIVE GAME TO PLAY.  YOU CAN MAKE FRIENDS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD OR NEXT DOOR.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Kindle Fire: This is my favorite AB game but the update I just downloaded shuts it down .<br />Please fix the problem so I can give this more stars!<br />11-15-13<br />Its fixed, im happy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am not usually a fan of books where every chapter is centered around a different character.  I usually feel disconnected to the story.  This book is the exception for me.  He managed to make the stories in each chapter complete enough for me to be satisfied and I began looking forward to seeing who was in the next and how they tied together.  I can't imagine writing something this complex.  Three countries, maybe fifteen main characters, yet they all fit together.  I would highly recommend this.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I haven't seen it for awhile so I decided to see if I still thought it was as great as I remembered.  It was.  Rick Moranis is very good as the nerdy but kind slub who finds himself the caretaker of a very hungrey man-eating plant.  Ellen Green is touching as the gentle soul who loves Moranis but is going with a really mean dentist.  Steve Martin and Bill Murray are appropriately over top as a sadistic dentist and his pain loving patient.  Let's not forget Audry 2 a plant with a big appetite and a bigger attitude.  I highly recomment this film.  Suitable for the family but you have to judge for yourself if small children will become plantphobic watching a big plant eat people ( however they may just be inspired to eat more vegetable as an act of self-defense).
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|It's fast paced excitement, but a little bit challenging (for a 10 year old).  &#34;It was very awesomely funnish.&#34;  My son plays it regularly
B007REV4YI|5.0|This review is specifically based on the fact that before this movie was released, I had purchased the &#34;50 Years Of Bond&#34; Blu-ray Boxed Collection, and this set already had a slot reserved for the Skyfall disc. So I really &#34;had&#34; to buy it :-)  Besides, Amazon wisely offered a $5 discount because they knew that I had the boxed set. Movie-wise, I do like it as well. I hadn't seen this one at the theater. For me, Sean Connery is my favorite Bond, but this film is my preferred Daniel Craig Bond movie.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|MAKING MOVIES is simply a great cool smooth ROCK album filled with great tunes like SOLID ROCK, TUNNEL OF LOVE and ROMEO AND JULIET!!!!!! Try all DIRE STRAITS STUFF....Simply great ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, DIRE STRAITS!!!!!!!!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved it from the beginning. Then there were the twists I never saw coming. Epilogue equally as good!  5 stars, hands down.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The only dislike I have is that sometimes I lose connection during a game and all winnings are lost for that particular game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very fun game. It is a great way to kill time while you are waiting around for something.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|lark risk to candleford season 1 is a great show once you start watching you wont want to stop. great loveable characters my favorite is (Dawn french)'s Caroline Arless (dorcas lane. Alf,Queenie,twister,robert timmins, and emma
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a good book! Thought provoking and such a good story I couldn't put it down, finished in 2 days. The way the stories were entertwined and how they all had a connection and out the outcomes could have been different if different choices were made. A very well thought out story, just wanted to stay in bed a read all day long!
1250030951|5.0|Maybe there are some 18-year-old girls who have no emotional scars and no anxieties.  If they exist and you are now or have ever been one of them, you will probably not enjoy this book.  From the moment when Cath avoided the dining hall in college because she was anxious about figuring out where the line started, how things would work, where she'd check out, where she'd sit, \\"Fangirl\\" grabbed a hold of me and never let go.  Rainbow Rowell painted these characters with a fine-stroked brush, and they were so achingly real to me ~ even the secondary characters, from her bipolar father to the mother who left the family when Cath and her twin were 8 years old, to the gentle and kind Levi, who gives smiles away for free as if it's the easiest thing in the world.  He was the kind of guy every girl claims they are looking for but seldom allows out of the \\"Friend Zone.\\"  Even the fictional world of Simon Snow was utterly gripping ~ both the books Cath grew up reading and the fanfiction she writes to escape her own life and make her feel safe, to give her a framework within which she can safely exist.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell is an exquisite writer.  She draws you into a world so achingly real, you can feel what her characters feel, all the way down into your bones.  It's rare to find a book with unique characters that don't fall into the hipster stereotype, a book with so much emotion that never veers into melodrama.  A book you can laugh with and cry with, and a heroine you can really root for with all your heart.  What I feel Rowell strove for in \\"Eleanor and Park\\" but didn't quite achieve, she has perfected in \\"Fangirl.\\"  I didn't want to leave Cath's world.  I cheered for her on every single page, and didn't want to stop when the book was finished.  This book surely will not appeal to everyone, but it was near perfect for me.  I would highly recommend it for everyone from young teens to adults.
B006LSZECO|4.0|So I listened to the first half as a book on tape and then when my road trip was over I bought the book and finished it in a day. What a messed up book that sucked me in and spit me out! This book consumed my thoughts and I couldn't wait to pick it back up. There were many times that I thought I had the mystery solved come to find out I was SO wrong! I must say I was relieved when it was over as I was tired of it consuming my thoughts with its crazy ways! I still highly recommend it if you have a couple days to spare as you get sucked into the vortex!
B00439MV42|3.0|Good, but not the best of the trilogy :)  Still....you really have to see all three if you are a fan :)
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Maybe it's just me but I couldn't help comparing Augustus to Alaska. It's like they are the same person, with the same afflictions but different adjectives are used. Overall good book. And even though I say all of this I read the whole book pretty quick, so it had my attention.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I loved watching House of Cards 1st season.  What a fantastic plot that keeps getting better and better. I'm hard of hearing and really appreciated that I can also watch this in closed caption as well as listen.  I can hardly wait for the 2nd season.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show has proven to be one of the best series I've ever watched!  I love the period, I love the costumes, and I love the characters!  Can't wait for the next season!
0140186409|5.0|I never had to read this for high school, but since it's an &#34;American Classic,&#34; I figured I needed to give it a try. Good read. Sad.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Love this movie.  It keeps you guessing until the end.  Plus I could watch it with my pre-teen!  Not to many movies that we both like and I  approve of.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use this app all the time. It's great if you have good eyes. Always reliable. Great for kids, and did I say it's free.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This was a great action film.  I want to see Red2 and had not yet seen Red, so I bought it because of the stars in the film. I appreciated that there was no nudity so that older kids could watch too, and not over-the-top swearing but still action packed. I will be going to the theater to see Red2.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This movie made me think of magic in a different light. If you loved watching The Illusionist and The Prestige then this movie is right up your alley. If you watched this movie and liked it and haven't seen The Illusionist or The Prestige then you need to watch those as well.
1451695187|5.0|I appreciated a true story that was given by a neurosurgeon, who was not a pastor, priest, or any religious leader.  He had all the science evidence to back-up his experience.  I purchased this book for others as it is a witness to after death experiences and proof of afterlife. This book is also confirming to a book &#34;Heaven is Real&#34; as experienced by a young boy.  I would recommend to all.
0071766588|4.0|Pro: CDs got Reading, Listening, Speaking, Writing and they're compatible with Mac/ PC. If you find CDs as a crucial way to practice, then buy this ETS product. In my experience, other brand's CDs usually have audio only,  which is a huge disappointment. For Mac users, Kaplan's TOEFL CD (2009 edition) will NEVER work since the CD was only compatible with old Macs with previous processor PowerPC before Apple decided to choose Intel processor (PC users are generally OK) .<br /><br />Cons: Reused samples of lectures/ student conversation etc in the book (I see same exact stuff for over 3 yrs and ETS gotta update the book)
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|bought this movie because i enjoyed the other die hards. Bruce Willis is a great actor love all of his movies. never disappointed me. but i can say this movie could of been a little better but i still enjoyed it i give it a 5 out of 6 and thats my opinion.<br /><br />if u seen all the other die hards then you should watch this one.
1908117230|5.0|There is a surprise in every bite!  I will try and attempt this masterpiece.  However, I wish they would ship to  the USA!!!
B007HO392S|5.0|She has an amazing voice. Her songs really mean alot. You can relate to them. Can't wait to see what comes next.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like that yo can earn acorns without having to purchase them . And you can earn money to play. Plus your Land starts off with bonus items. I<br />like all the mini games.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is fun and addicting! I really love it and I can't stop playing it! The only problem is that it won't let me send or receive notifications.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|But I got it as the free app of the day and it works well with my Kindle Fire! Not a bad  little app!
B00005K3GS|4.0|I was looking for this cd and finally found it, the cd is ok condition and the sound is good, I got what I asked, so no complains
1452126577|5.0|I hate to admit it but this book made me smile many many times. I feel I have let down the whole Grumpy Cat universe! My apologies. Altho I am usually a very grumpy person (just ask my husband)this book was SO Grumpy that it had the opposite effect on me. So be warned !!  If you are having a wonderfully grumpy/cranky/terrible/awful/stinky day this book may make you feel slightly better so you should probably avoid it until you can stare into those Grumpy eyes & those grumpy lips without cracking up or allowing a single ray of sunshine to fall upon your face. It's your Grumpy duty & just because I have failed in my quest to resist the pleasures of this book doesn;t mean that you have to follow me into the sadness of defeat. Perhaps it is best said that to resist the Grumpster is futile. It may be better to avoid this cat altogether.<br />NAH !!!!!!! Enjoy the heck outta this silly if over-used \\"grumpy\\"cat face. Life is short, share the Grumpy cat with your friends & loved ones. I showed it to my cats & they were totally unimpressed. Grumpy/Lumpy/Stumpy .... where's my darn food!!  Why would you waste your time looking at that cat book when you have US ....... Ohhhhh stupid humans. They are so easily entertained & amused.

B008CJ0KI8|2.0|At the 2013 Grammy's, the major label debut album by Frank Ocean was nominated for numerous awards including Best Urban Contemporary Album where it beat out Chris Brown's Fortune and Miguel's Kaleidoscope Dream, sadly Miguel was robbed that night.  R&B music has always been my favorite genre of music, and while I feel it's a dying sound in the mainstream there are artists out there keeping it alive. Unfortunately Frank Ocean isn't one of them as many of the youngsters claim. I first heard about Frank a few years with the buzz single Novacane from his debut mix tape Nostalgia, Ultra. After over a year off buzz, Ocean released his debut CD. While Ocean does have a decent studio voice, the production on CD has too many styles. Outside of the singles Thinkin Bout You , Super Rich Kids and the album track Pink Matter feat. Andre 3000 nothing on this album really impressed me.  Frank Ocean has yet to impress me, and until he does he will be an overrated singer.  To everyone who think Frank's R&B he's not. Ocean is a PBR&B artist, also referred to as R-Neg-B, hipster R&B and alternative R&B a term used by music journalists to describe an emerging, stylistic alternative to contemporary R&B. Real R&B music is alive in the forms of singers like JOE, Avant, Charlie Wilson and Eric Benet.
B000001FKY|5.0|Took me back to my high school days.<br />I loved all the songs.<br />Fast delivery, too!<br />Would recommend reliving the great 1970s & 1980s music!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|An excellent feast of the mind. Morbid, unpredictable, and of course riddled with most creative homicides prime time could hope to offer, this show honors every part of the original series while adding its own delicate flair.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Such a compelling story--actually 5 stories!  Beautifully written describing the interaction of each of the families. Highly recommend this book.
B0024CEY36|4.0|I reallly liked it.<br />as always follett intertwines his story brilliantly with history.<br />the end was a bit dull though.
0316066524|4.0|Wallace was a brilliant man. No contest. His vocabulary was prodigious, and his ability to write -- to describe people and things inside and out -- was truly gorgeous. If you are a fan of literature -- not so much for stories, plots, and characters, but for the basic pleasure of the language -- then you'll like this book. It is page after page after page of rich, sumptuous writing.<br /><br />If, however, you are the type to interest yourself in things like plots, you might need to reconsider. If the book is about anything, it is about a dangerous movie called INFINITE JEST, a film so entertaining that, when you watch it, you lose the will to do anything else, eventually dying from malnutrition and dehydration because you will refuse to move from the screen.<br /><br />If that kind of symbolism seems a little too on-the-nose for you, then you should avoid the book, because it's not the only time Wallace uses a heavy-hand with his point. The book follows all number of people who are killing themselves with \\"fun\\" -- drug/alcohol addicts figure prominently in the story, as do the squeezed-dry students of a tennis academy. Depression, communication, choice, suicide, and self-awareness are all also major themes in the book, dealt with in sometimes excruciating detail, and belied by the bevy of rather silly plot elements Wallace occasionally throws into the book (a kid gets a computer monitor stuck on his head and it takes days for him to get it removed; North America is now a united organization known as O.N.A.N.; an addict is injured in a limbo contest and spends the novel scuttling like a crab, bent over backwards on his hands and knees). All of these (often eye-rolling) attempts at humor barely disguise the fact that, as the novel says, \\"What we're basically talking about here is loneliness.\\"<br /><br />He talks about it in a riveting, gorgeous, unflinching way, but it is taxing as well, and that's not just because the book is 1,100 pages long. James Incandenza (the name another of Wallace's too-weighty jokes) is the maker of the titular film, and the rest of his body of work is often described as being equally torturous, cerebral, too focused on technical elements and not focused enough on being entertaining. The parallels between James and Wallace himself are impossible to miss. There are a lot of ways that books can satisfy readers, but unless you choose to enjoy this novel solely for its virtuosity, the only other way to enjoy it is on a rather coldly clinical level. \\"I see what he did there,\\" you might say knowingly, but it's not like seeing is the same as feeling. It's the difference between enjoying the mathematical formula for a fractal versus that fractal's spiraled, endless visual representation.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because the book is all about feelings. It spends so much time detailing the viscera of so many characters, but it ends up seeming almost like a flippant dismissal of them. For instance, the book has no ending. Wallace has stated in interviews that the book has an obvious destination -- that if readers really paid attention to the ways certain narratives were progressing they could see their converging endpoints and figure the ending out on their own -- but for a book that spends so much time describing every mote of dust and shaft of light, the huge gap left by the ending is very much like a slap to the reader. Or worse than a slap: a cold shoulder. Yes, intellectually, I can see how the ambiguity, the forced academic digestion is in fitting with the book's themes, but I also see how it is evidence of a writer who uses his brilliance to further distance himself from an audience (maybe world) that he ultimately turned away from for good.<br /><br />This is not to disparage Wallace's memory or condemn his suicide: the book is very much a treatise on both depression and self-immolation, and although it can very easily be read as a suicide note, it's not the balefully pitying kind. This is just to saythat -- as much as I loved and enjoyed the book for all of the ways it was amazing -- I also saw that, ultimately, this is what happens when someone is so brilliant that they refuse to allow any kind of limitation to make their light (their incandescence) accessible or to give it any kind of proper meaning or use. Books are meant to be bridges between authors and readers, and this book feels more like the Grand Canyon. Gorgeous. Stunning. Huge and almost unreal. But also, in the end, less of a bridge than a gap, and almost a condemnation of anyone who feels compelled to cross it alive.that -- as much as I loved and enjoyed the book for all of the ways it was amazing -- I also saw that, ultimately, this is what happens when someone is so brilliant that they refuse to allow any kind of limitation to make their light (their incandescence) accessible or to give it any kind of proper meaning or use.

B00ECU2SGS|3.0|It was okay. Worth renting I guess... Nothing spectacular so don't get your hopes up. But good acting and an okay story line..
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is pretty quick to tell me what the weather is going to be like. It does come w/a few ads at the bottom but it's simple and easy to use.

B0057F869U|3.0|I think that i wasted money in buying this version of jane eyre, to bad that you did not offer it as a rental.  I love the 2005 version done by bbc i believe
B00C2IPB70|4.0|The only complaint I have, is that there is nothing that comes inside the box. It's an awesome steelbook, I'll give it that, but there's not even a paper insert promoting another movie.. Just empty. Still an awesome movie though!
B00114RKT8|4.0|I am glad they still make movies like this, with historical views and with lots of meaning! I would like more choices like this one

B004QX07G4|3.0|I found this book funny at times but I wouldn't say it was hilarious. Sometimes it was super corny but that is Ellen's style.
B000R7GKQE|4.0|Received in time promised. Jacket was smashed but discs were in tact. Play well when being watched. Again was described as being in excellent condition. Discs only.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I found this to be a very funny read. I can't wait until she writes another. Tina Fey is of the funniest women around!
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I received in time promised. jacket was smashed but the discs were in tact and play well when watching. When ordered in described it was in excellent condition. Guess it just meant the discs.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|I respect the author for her perseverance and if she experienced emotional growth, she needed to, and that's good, but, in addition, if she intended for the book to be inspirational, encouraging, hopeful, etc., she should have said more about it at the end of the book.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|It does exactly what is announced. In addition it charges my devices very quickly, probably quicker than when connected to the AC line. Highly recommended
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie followed the book very closely. It was a unique story line and the acting was right on target,<br />I highly recommend this movie

B009NG1Q96|5.0|Where's the third book!!! Ready for the next book already a lot of things happening and I'm ready for some loose ends to be tied up
B003O86FMW|3.0|The book did drag initially. The lead characters going about boring activities. They laid the ground work for the story and in the second half it gets exciting. Not as engaging as the first book, but enough to keep the electronic pages turning beneath my fingers.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Didnt expect much out of this, but its surprised me, Going camping or if you just need to sharpen, This is a great product
0140557741|5.0|Great book for team building activity.  We tore the pages out in order to use it this way.  Very effective for discussing perspective and communication.<br /><br />My children also enjoyed it before I took it to work!  They had some very interesting thoughts on it for 4 and 7...
B007ZYJT1U|2.0|This was probably the most depressing piece of literature I've ever read.It also had very little substance as to where the storyline was heading.I finished it only because I never start a book without finishing.I boringly suffered to the end.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|My sister introduced this game to me but I don't own an iPad. I love strategizing battles with her. So happy it finally came to Kindle!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The movie itself is one of the best ever made, but the Blu-ray disc would not play on my Blu-ray decks, and the Digital Copy Code would not work! Had to write Paramount Support and send them scanned copies of the document showing the download code and my Amazon receipt! That's NOT what I paid for! I am considering sending it back for a replacement. Very disappointed!
1439102813|5.0|This book tells the story of Alzheimer's from inside the patient.  I didn't know, but wondered, if they were aware of what is happening to them.  Its so sad to know they actually are aware of their minds deteiorating at a cruel snail pace.  But I thnk I can actually see things better from my Mother's side of it now.  It was interesting to learn the # of people affected by this cruel disease that are 60 yrs and younger.
B0081336FO|5.0|Of all the iterations of Sherlock Holmes these days, this is the most literate and cogent. I can't wait for season 3!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is an extraordinary series.  The characters are well developed; and the acting is superb.  It is well balanced-giving an objective view of the aristocrats upstairs and staff downstairs.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|I have not watched It as of yet. It looked good when I seen It on TV. So I hope my friend will like it.
1591840562|4.0|This book was a good price and had lots of inspirational tips on how to start your own business. It shipped quickly and was a great buy.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I enjoyed this game, most of the content is free and those who do not want to pay for in game currency are not helplessly outgunned by the players who do drop a few bucks into the game.
0321544080|5.0|This book is an amazing journey through the life of one of the worlds best photographers. Great images and in depth information. A must for anybody interested in photography.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I would recomend this game to anyone, very addicting. Very fun, good problem solving game!! A+ Its worth  the money. You won't disappointed!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Great book! Good story. enjoyed it good price. Pure sci-fi.what else can I say? give it a try its worth the time.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|normally i dont like those searching games but this had from the very beginning. easy to handle, not painfully hard and oh so creepy. :)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Fell in love with Cassie Clare's Inferno Devices series first and then discovered this modern day series set in New York.  Brilliant characters, thrilling plot twists, and of course never to be complete with the High Warlock of Brooklyn Magnus Bane.  No other word except for AMAZING seems fitting!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the look and ease of use....large display is great for my old eyes!  Good basic functionality and extremely handy.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Have watched it twice, dialogue was strong, acting competent, and ending well done. This a keeper for sure. Buy it.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I've enjoyed reading this book, if nothing to get a peak inside how one person works and how his uniqueness came to change the face of our world. Suspend judgement and see the man for who he was.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love this show and watching it on Kindle is great - no commercials ! I have been catching up on all the shows I missed.
0446699616|5.0|This is one of those 'can't put down' books. I was constantly keep in suspense.<br />&#34;Who is the Panther?&#34; &#34;Where is he?&#34;<br />Buy this book. You will love it! I did.
B003B02O0A|5.0|This is John's greatest book! Cannot wait for the sequel. Hope he keeps writing for many years. Like every book.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I wish I read this a long time ago. This has made learn how to be a better companion. Currently, I don't know if my girlfriend has read this book yet, but I can already see the positive impact on our relationship because this book made me realize not only do other people want to be loved differently, but what those different ways to be loved (languages) are and how to identify them. This book also helped me focus less on why is she not contributing to our relationship as much as I am and more on how I can make my efforts of love be more effective to her. This is the best relationship book I've read.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Fun game, great to play when your trying to kill time.. My kids love it, they play this game until they fall asleep
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I actually buy all of King's books as soon as they are out but did not on this one--Not a Kennedy fan so just did not have any interest in the book.  Huge surprise--great book!  King at his &#34;non Horror&#34; best.  The story flows and you really don't want to put the book down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a great game. I've only played it for a short time so far but it has been very entertaining
B008476HBM|5.0|Jane Austin's novels and especially Pride and Prejudice stand the test of time. Great stories about realistic people who have depth.
B001DZDTY0|4.0|Their best album after Superunknown and not mastered quite as well. Love the Johnny Cash cover of Rusty Cage also.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It is a very good book that i would read over and over agian. i hope he hurries with the last book
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Remasters of classic albums like this usually fail miserably by ruining the original sound and turning the analog imperfections of the original into a sterile, digital strain on the ears. Not so here.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|It was a really good book and i deeply enjoyed it. i am waiting for the third and final book
B0052VI2WA|5.0|This is one of those CD's where SACD really means something. Very well remastered. The sound is absolutely tremendous if you have equipment that can illuminate it properly.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This is by far the best workout video I've ever done.  Jillian is tough but awesome!  After 4 days I am more energetic and feeling better.  Be diligent and the results well come.
1609611543|1.0|this is another paleo/atkins diet book disguised as something else. i thought it was a book about eliminating wheat and it begins like that but then as you go through the book, it then tells you that you can't eat all these other foods, essentially all carbs including rice, beans, certain vegetables, fruits etc....
B00DDVPXTG|5.0|This collection of 5 CD's includes 2 never previously released on CD. Evangeline and Thirteen appearing on CD for the first time. Thirteen has always been my favorite Emmylou album. It also includes the out print CD,Cimmaron which is only available at exhorbadant prices. I can add nothing to the praise heaped upon Emmylou through the years. Her voice is a national treasure.
0307887448|4.0|Greetings, Program! Would you like to play a game? Have you ever been chased by a ghost named Blinky? Or eaten by a Grue? Ever been recruited by the Star League? Rolled a d20? If you know that knowing is half the battle, then this book is for you.  If none of that made any sense, then you might not enjoy the book quite as much.  The 80's are alive and well in 2044, at least in the virtual universe known as OASIS.  Somewhere in this computerized utopia lies an easter egg hidden by the recently deceased computer developer.  The finder inherits an enormous fortune...and 1980's trivia holds the clues to finding it.<br />This is not high literature, but it is a fun novel.  Just as Xanth was an excuse for Piers Anthony to make bad puns, OASIS is an excuse for Cline to reference cheesy 80's culture.  The main character reminds me of Matthew Broderick's character in War Games, and that is no doubt intentional.  Good, entertaining read!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Read it!  Great mystery that keeps you totally engrossed.  Don't read it late at night or you may have to sleep with the lights on!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Wonderful comfort. I had purchased the belkin design and returned because the software was &#34;in the cloud and required me to log on to internet every time to change key settings. Well let me back up. I never got that far because once I went through the process of downloading software and registering (required to use product) with the website, it then refused my email address ass &#34;not on file or incorrect&#34; Bear in mind this was the same e mail address that a confirmation link was sent to and used to register with and confirmed by same. Then I tried to use on line support but could not get help for product because the product was not registered, so I went to register the product purchase, as this is separate from registering as a cloud user of the software I could not access. During the process of registering purchase and answering all these questions last step is to enter the lengthy very small typed serial number off the box and / or keypad. Serial number was recognized but the product number (taken verbatim off the box and the product was refused as an improper item number. There was no product support phone number in box and was later told once you log in they have one posted on line. This would have been useful if I could log in I guess. After spending the extra money to have it rush delivered and spending three days asking through e-mails for someone to call me from their support team without success, I gave up and bought the G-13. And I love it. There is one switch which is activated by downward depression of the small joystick and it is not to useful as hard as it has to be depressed downward. No other drawbacks or negatives. Very comfortable and could not be easier to assign key functions too. Cool lcd display does all kinds of neat stuff but mainly displays some basic  info for my WOW toons. The Razer does not have a padded or rubber-like palm rest this one does and is better. The Razer also has a scroll wheel like on a mouse this does not. The only thing that could make it better is wireless capability, but if I had my way they would be outlawed- wires that is...
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Devops concepts were clearly explained through examples, based on real life situations (unfortunately).  I think that more books should be written using this style.
B008OIQYTG|3.0|You know what your getting into...but just a bit typical and slow at times.  Lee is a wonderful guitar player...
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is the best film I have seen in a very long time. Marvel done a great job on the cast and the movies that lead up to this movie. It is a great movie for most ages (7 years old and up).
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Awesome app I use every night well worth the $2,99.  Lots of options in sounds and lots of options in volumes in each sound hundreds of combinations.  Highly recommend if you like sound machines to sleep and timer is great with end app option at end.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Not as good as the first one, but still has a lot of action and thrills throughout the film. The bada$$ team shows they still have it.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I only have a 7&#34; screen so find the faces of the cards difficult to identify.  It would probably be better on a larger screen
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grishams Books are always delightful and easy to read.<br />An added plus is: that the reader always learns something about the Law.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Daniel Kahneman is a thoughtful diligent scientist whose work explains many of the odd behaviors we see in markets, organizations and everyday life.<br /><br />This book is easy to read and strikes an impressive balance; it preserves much of the evidence and logic found in his academic works, but presents the information in an approachable narrative.<br /><br />His deep friendship with Amos Tversky comes through, and parts of this book are an homage to the elder member of this partnership. That human touch adds readability and enjoyment.<br /><br />The topic - how humans think in the face of making decisions and uncertainty - is a dangerous field, with many potential arguments and debates.  Kahneman doesn't wave his Nobel Prize in our face.  Rather, he acknowledges other points of view, fairly shows the evidence for them, explains where there is room for agreement (or not) and, most impressively, acknowledges his own biases.<br /><br />This book does NOT neatly fit a category - it applies to business, psychology, simulation and models.... (we use it in game theory modeling).<br /><br />But you need not be a hard core geek of any stripe - if you simply want to understand human behavior in a richer way, you should read this book.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|it should have better instuctions. don't by it if no one you know told you how to play.it is like an blobs of snott.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Got this for the kids to watch as the adults talked.  It was pretty cure, we all ended up watching it.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Super surprised of the good quality for an inexperienced seconds. Looks very nice next to our wedding portrait. Exceptional bargain!
1451695195|5.0|This book is about the best I've seen to convey an opinion that there is continuation of existence after death. I feel this will make a believer out of most everyone.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love these types of games and to have one for my new kindle fire is even better! Everyone should try this game.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie is an underrated film with a good story line and enough action for anyone! The cast is very good and Rhianna  proves she can act as well as sing.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|People keep expecting the same old campy Star Trek. This is a dark movie with dark themes; betrayal being one. The characters have grown beyond \\"beam me up Scotty\\" . I agree that Simon Pegg was a bit over the top, but since he has become a star in his own right they probably had him in the movie more than he should have. I would like to see a remake of the city of the edge of forever; a good story plot not hampered with constant CGI effects.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Entertaining but it clinched on me a while ago and still haven't seen my credit return. Slots are fun and bingo has an interesting twist. Overall good.
B000UR9T82|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter.  She is a Spiderman fan!<br />Spent three nights enjoying the movies with the entire family (-:
0812973992|5.0|At times an amazing bit of writing.  The characters are totally real, and sympathetic, even when they're weak.  Truly an experience.
B005R32L66|5.0|Not much to say downloaded this on new android tablet been using Skype for about a year. It works fine
B005WUHAX8|5.0|As I type I have my casein. I took this to the great wolf lodge (actually bought it just for the Great Wold lodge waterpark) & I took amazing underwater pictures and never damaged my phone. I absolutely love this!
B00AEFXEZE|3.0|In real DVD standards, the picture and sound of this copy is more like a VHS reception, but yes, a clear one.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie actually surprised me which is extremely difficult to do. I unfortunately usually have everything figured out in a movie within the first 5-20 minutes. All the curve balls they throw I see coming a mile away. I don't want to ruin this movie for anyone, so I won't explain more. It was the MOST FUN I've had watching a film in a long while!!! I can't recommend it more and I originally had no desire to see it. The BEST HEIST movie (and SO MUCH MORE) I've seen in years! I just LOVED this movie and have recommended it to all I know and they agree-if you want to see a movie you are on the edge of your seat wondering where it's going next, want to laugh, root, clap, gasp, etc...this is the movie for YOU!
B0051MKMNC|5.0|I always enjoy watching this movie all over again. Not only is the story intellectual but i like how it evolved to suspense. Great ending.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|Seen it a few times over the years and still enjoy it. The new generation should watch it to see the fight, will and honor coming together.
B002PJ8AE2|5.0|Got this for my niece, she plays with it every day. I am very surprised of the price, and how good it holds up against my 4 year old niece... she even sits on top of the car and ride on it... Would recommend..
B009CCBCU4|5.0|For those of you who like historical fiction give this tale set in pre-Columbian Mexico a go. Zoe has an in depth understanding of the times and culture of the Nahuatl people. Travel with her to the ancient Aztec city of Texcoco... it's quite a journey!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a very entertaining game. I am very glad I got this game and would recommend it to anyone of any age range!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how you have a hard time trying to solve a problem,and you don't know what to do. Then you find the calculator app on your tablet...You do the problem you had trouble on, then BINGO!!! You got the answer,I promise you will love it...It's just like a friend giving you a present because you tried to get to  her house,but it did not happen!I really hope you enjoy it too!!!
B0084I9QIW|4.0|Great CD would highly recomend for fans of Michal jackson.....the quality could be better. The price is very good....enjoy.<br />Thank you
B008XG1X18|3.0|As with the Facebook app, the pinterest app does not work as well on the kindle fire HD as well as it  worked on my kindle fire.  Again...Disappointed with my kindle fire HD.
1451648537|5.0|Yeah, he might have been an AH but he was passionate and he liked to work with &#34;A&#34; players.  I have insisted that my sons read this to truly understand the path of this visionary.  i would love to read a biography  by Isaacson on the &#34;true&#34; Bill Gates.  It would be interesting to see the comparisons and contrasts.  Isaacson's research, and writing style is so engaging, I also read his book on Benjamin Franklin!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|For some reason this app does not work as good on my HD as the app on my kindle fire.  Disappointed!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This novel is a great read is you want to dive right into a story!  Jojo Moyes has a way of grabbing the reader right away...you will love it
B006VRRGNK|5.0|This item was received quickly. I bought them for my husband, as he loves each of these movies and he watches them often.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|I have tried to cut at least 28 bottles and only about 3 have cut clean.  I have gone back to videos! Tried hot water and ice after the cutter and just don't understand why it will not cut clean.  I am going to look for a new craft!  Hope you have better luck!
B005S9EJ14|3.0|I received this item quickly.  The movie was not as good as other movies that Maggie Smith and Judy Dench have starred in.  I enjoy watching the two of them in movies together.  I will have to watch it again to see if I am missing something.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and very addictive. I just wish that there was a way to earn more gems faster because I don't have the money to purchase them and some goals require you to use gems to accomplish them
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a must for all ages it is really exciting and quite exciting it  needs quite a bit of skill but you can handle it
0321934318|4.0|Something for everyone. This text is well organised, and it's loaded with explanatory images. There are also some useful resources availble to download. Recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|works great on my kindle. love it and so do ky kids! cant get it away from them. took a while for downloading though.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|May be tired of it but I don't care. I enjoy listening to this song, it cheer me up.<br /><br />I applauded for GAGA who's back on her new album, the fourth album this time I think.<br /><br />GAGA is fun to watch and listen.....<br /><br />I don't care if GAGA is \\"REDUCTIVE\\" but so what!. GAGA & MADONNA are both American-Italian.....
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Bought it for my 3 yrs old twin girls room, and they, (& I) love it!!!  Sticks to the wall very well and if need to be moved around it peels off easily.  Their room looks very pretty and colorful with these beautiful Disney decals!
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I loved Damian Stevenson's first Ian Fleming novel and was delighted to discover that the second book, &#34;The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Parsifal,&#34; is out. Based on my previous experience with Mr. Stevenson's work, I expected a tight plot, realistic descriptions, and language reminiscent of World War II era, yet engaging for today's readers. This book delivers all that, and more.<br /><br />This installment of the story starts in London near the end of World War II, in January 1945. One of the first powerful images that Mr. Stevenson creates is that of St. Paul's Cathedral, seen as a &#34;symbol of hope for a nation near the end of its rope.&#34; This one phrase alone conveys so much: defiance, long-time suffering, and the expectation of a much-needed victory.<br /><br />Before Mr. Stevenson thrusts us into the action, he takes some time to create a well-drawn portrait of Ian Fleming as a private person at home, in an intimate setting with Ann. Fleming is going about his daily routine but lamenting &#34;the half-forgotten paradise that was London before the war.&#34; That opening, a sort of calm before the storm that is about to erupt on the pages of this book, made me immediately engaged and involved with the main character.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I bought this to cut the bottoms off of wine bottles. It was an idea my fiancee found for our wedding centerpieces. It works. Simple as that. It takes a little getting used to in terms of how deep to cut, but the results are very smooth cuts with little finising needed. Adjustment to each bottle is a little tricky as the adjusters are crude, but get the job done and hold the fixture in it's position when in use. There are 6 actual cutters included, which is a nice features. Only other thing is it comes with sandpaper, not emery cloth.... but thats a minor detail.
B001ET081W|5.0|I love the Ramones!! This cd is them extending their reach which they do well. As joey grows so does the band!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This film is an amazing adaptation of the book.  Absolutely fantastic!  I have watched it multiple times!  Jennifer Lawrence is stellar!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I personally love the character development in this movie, particularly of Thor. It's believable and heartfelt. Natalie Portman pulls off the female nerd role very well, and, try as I might to hate her for being the love interest, she's just too adorable!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The battery hd app is a really good app to have and the reason are as followed:<br />1) It is free. I brought the free app to try it out and it has all that I need for free<br />2) It tells you how many you got until the kindle is fully charged.<br />3) It tells you long you can do the stuff on your kindle before you need to charge it.<br />And last but not least 4) You can do it so that when you put the charger in it will come up to show it is charging.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the updates are too slow to get and i have to wait a week or 2 and it sucks.<br />the app is awesome and i recomend it to anyone who likes to watch over someone elses shoulder.<br />.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Audio is terrible and defective! This blu-ray needs to be recalled and fixed immediately. No sound from the front right or rear speakers in 5.1 surround. Video quality is sub par as well. Problems everywhere in the world with this release.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this is by far the best bingo app! I play it on my phone and kindle fire and enjoy both! power ups are super fun.
B000NY17J6|5.0|she has always been one of my most favorite singers and i really enjoy the c.d. since all ive had was her cassettes.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|this game could be alot more fun if you didn't waste time trying to zoom in or out. Just a little frustrated that the time runs out really fast then you have to buy crystals or coins? if you want to continue!  Could give you better instructions to play the game better.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This game is just complex enough.  It is challenging to play without being so challenging you just give up in frustration.  It is also fun enough to play multiple times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I play just about every day my brother and lil sister play it it a game for all ages
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|\\"If you can fight, fight...our war has just begun\\"...best line from the movie!  Great story, plot, direction, action and acting in this thriller, action flick.  By far the best action movie of 2013!
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|kerrelyn sparks books are so good  it keeps you wanting more to read  i have just last book waiting for the next one
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|An on-going ramble that might be interesting to some; just not to me. Each chapter very much like the last.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Movie Review:<br />Movie is AWESOME!<br /><br />Phaser Review:<br />I pre-ordered this in June(?) and had a bit of buyers remorse at having spent so much on a movie, but I wanted the phaser! The other pre-order included the villain ship for much less - but i figured that for $20 bucks or so the ship must be tiny/cheap. When it arrived (on time 9/10/13) I the first thing that I noticed is how heavy it was - it definitely didn't feel cheap. I then pushed everything that could possibly be a button - to try and get the stun/kill thingy to spin - nothing! Disappointment set in. I had never been to the QMx website to read about the features of the phaser - I had only looked at the pics provided by Amazon showing the action blur indicating spin. I did more research online and actually read (from QMx) the description of the phaser. It is EXACTLY as described by the manufacturer. The only real fault I have is with the incomplete description by Amazon. I then spent the next 45 minutes shooting the cats, people on tv and my husband - pew-pew-pew!!! Disappointment gone! It now has a place of honor next to my 3152 piece LEGO Super Star Destroyer.<br /><br />My phaser:<br />1) Is heavy, solidly built and feels great in your hand<br />2) Is lined up perfectly (all parts)<br />3) Spins freely (manually) and settles (magnetically) into place<br />4) Is painted beautifully - no drips or areas missed<br /><br />Live long and prosper!
B0001I562I|5.0|Love it! Yes I do! Love It! Love it! Yes I do! Best Wonderful interesting intriguing funny good time for all
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game, it is a great way to have a bit of horsey fun. The images are very clear and it is enjoyable to play.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Good product with a great price tag.  It has plenty of cord so you don't have to be attached at the hip to your subject, and has good quality pick up.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I am so hooked on this game! I have played many of the other bingo apps and this is by far my favorite!
0142419850|5.0|I have read and own all of the Alex Rider books.  This was my favorite, out of all of them.  It was so emotional.  Just be prepared to cry.
006178480X|3.0|This may be my last Rollins novel. Just finished reading last night and felt I had wasted my time. Plenty of thrills just little story to connect the impossible situations his team fights their way out of. Too many instances of something so outlandish happening to save their bacon that I felt a bit insulted. Has the feel of being thrown together with too little thought to plot or character development. Been with Sigma Team since Map of Bones. Think this is where I will be getting off. Best wishes to the characters I've grown to know over these many volumes, these characters I can no longer bring myself to care about as they become increasingly one dimensional. I hope Rollins either does significantly better by them in future adventures, or just puts the Sigma Team out to retirement which would be my constructive suggestion after reading this latest effort.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I do not recommend  ff I deleted it from my device with in 2 hours of download..don't wast your time :)
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is s good read. I enjoyed this book and I am already giving it to my neighbors daughter to read. I think she will enjoy it.
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|I use it because I paid for it, but there are better ones that are free. This is lacking and really should be free.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Rating is for disc bundle not operation.<br />All I got to see was commercials for over a half hour+.<br />Restarted it numerous rimes, finally unplugged network cable to kill the commercials.<br />Plays fine if its cannot get commercials.<br />This is the first disc that did this.
B00E193TM2|5.0|I really like this album. They collaborated with vocalists from other bands, and those songs really kick a**.  I like every song on this one, and really glad I purchased this album.
B00006HBUB|1.0|I got the wrong item, but i didn't want to pay shipping and handling, so i just sold it to Game Craze. Instead of Scooby-Doo, i received American Pie 2, and I was extremely disappointed...
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|I liked this Iron Man 3 because it showed that Tony Stark is Iron Man even without his suit. I especially liked the part where Pepper Potts got to wear the suit.
B000P407K4|5.0|An old movie that I have seen many times before.  But, I still watch it again on occasion just because I like it.
B00304RMFE|5.0|This compilation of anime shorts, is actually a good filler for those of us who don't play the game, but do enjoy the books.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Fast moving, lots of twists & turns, compares very well with other Lee Childs books, recommended reading for all fans
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does what it is supposed to do with minimal fuss or bother. It pretty much does its job without me even being aware it's there. Highly recommended.
B008JH5HCW|4.0|Did you like Rambo?  The Expendables (1 & 2)?  All the Die Hard movies?  Everything with Schwarzenegger in it?  Then don't skip Lockout.  It's a classic action movie and a pretty good representation of the genre.<br /><br />Okay okay so maybe there's some plot holes and some predictably stupid bad guys and, you know, the usual action movie props.  But there's good wit, good humor, good one-liners and good action.  It's not weighted down by a bunch of soppy drama.  The main character is perfectly likable, finding himself in a situation he'd prefer not to be in, trying to do more-or-less the right thing while also trying to arrange a little sneaky side mission he needs to get done.  It's not going to win any Oscars but the acting is solid enough to not cause any distraction.<br /><br />It's just good fun.<br /><br />Should you buy it or rent it?  I dunno.  Did you buy or rent the Die Hard series?  There's your answer.
B000C20VRS|1.0|After almost 30 years after its release, I finally took the time to watch this film that is so loved by so many people. OMG, why? This is such crap. Bad acting, worst Latin accents since \\"West Side Story\\", and dumb storyline and situations. Al Pacino has not made a good movie since the \\"Godfather\\" movies. Let's face it, he's the biggest over-acting actor around. Bombastic buffoon. Some of the scenes made it seem like a comic take on Cubans and drug-lord movies, like \\"Airplane\\" was a take off of \\"Airport\\". Too many ridiculous scenes to mention.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|Love this app. Only thing is when I'm typing something into the body for an outgoing email/new message, I'm limited to scrolling down because the page ends at a certain point, disabling me from seeing what I'm typing. Other than that, convenient for kindle use.
B004NIFK9Q|2.0|just not for me.  Very dry and drawn out.  Gave up reading after trying to under stand the point of it all
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Just wow! I don't really know what else to say.  It was an amazing story and I cannot wait for Holder's story.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Loved the movie in the theater. The disc doesn't play on any of my three different Samsung 3D Blu Ray players (different models). It just gives a blue screen saying that you need 3D equipment with the latest firmware. I have the latest firmware. Maybe one day Samsung will put out firmware that will support this disc.<br /><br />Make sure your equipment will support this disc before you buy it. This is the first one that didn't work, so I will never pre-order a disc again and just wait until I can verify it works before buying.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Didn't have time to read much when I was young and happily reading 'classics' now.  Tom Sawyer is a wonderful read.  Humor and mystery abound. You will feel like you are right back in the 'day'.  Characters are delightlfully human and real. Superbly written; a joy to read.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I have always loved this movie. It is just good silly fun!!!! We watch it over and over again when we need a good pick me up!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I watched this with my 13 year old daughter and we always check out movies on the website&#34;Plugged In&#34; as to see the content of what Hollywood tries to &#34;slip in&#34; the movies  that go against our MORALS. At the very beginning of the movie it showed an extremely seductive scene-which I was thinking &#34;oh no...they have to ruin this movie as well....&#34; So I became hesitant that we might have to turn off the movie....We did not however...the movie had only 1-2 other suggestive comments regarding sex and profanity. I would have given 5 stars as it was a great movie...except for the morality insertions. Considering the trash that is out there that Hollywood makes that intentionally is designed to lower out morals-this was a  great movie!!!!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|We all know the tragic stories of two original members of Alice in Chains, Mike Starr and Layne Staley, whose drug abuse demons took their lives. The band's brave decision to continue on following Staley's passing was the best surprise in music in recent memory.  I'll never forget the wonder I felt when I found out Alice was playing the Del Mar races in 2006, years after I thought they were done. And that show was brilliant. Will Duvall can sing like no other. In fact, one on my favorite Alice songs is Private Hell - I love the back and forth between Jerry and Will. Which brings me back to the devil. I find myself wondering what could have been, had Jerry allowed Will to sing lead on this new album. Jerry hired Will for a reason, but it seems like all he let Will do on this new album was sing along in the background. That being said, the crushing guitar riffs, heavy dirty bass and deep lyrics on The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here place it right up there with all of Alice's great albums.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was a fun, nice story.  I wanted tl keep reading to see what the children would come up with next.  Of course it had a good bit of make believe.
B00DJXSKWU|3.0|Mechcom was a vary fun and some what challenging game I ended up playing for hours, but there isnt all that many uupgrades to buy and the matches are to short. Also I think they should make it online so you can play against other people. So thats why I only gave three stars, but if your debating wether or not to buy this game well you should! One more thing the developer's need to up the amount of units you can field at one time. But on the hole this is I great game to kill some time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I already was in love with Pinterest and now I have it on the go, this is one dangerously addicting app to have!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The Secret Society has quests, recharging energy, collections, and other elements common to hidden object games on social media platforms, but thankfully you can complete it without bugging your friends for help! It functions well and includes enough variety to make it interesting, but it takes up a lot of space on a Kindle Fire, and players have to play each scene many times to advance.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The graphics are great and there is enough variety and challenge to keep this interesting.  Looking forward to more levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|There's nothing bad about this game. It was free and my son love the minions. As far as I can tell he has no complaints about it.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|David Becker, the handsome and brilliant academic and Susan Fletcher,the beautiful and talented code breaker for NSA,<br />are co-protagonists trying to break a code that might cripple the U..S.intelligence network.  This book will keep you awake nights<br />with your eyes glued to the page.  It's a very fine thriller.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love it, its an excellent game and continue to refer others. I wish it was a bit easier to stay in the game instead of time outs due to no more emery but I guess we cant have our cake and eat it too...
B003NHRIUW|5.0|I love the movie, I cry every time I watch it. Miley is a very beautiful, and talented young lady. She's already proved she all grown up.<br />She doesn't need to take her clothes off to get  her point across. She's a rare gem.<br /><br />Thanks<br />lyg662
B000002W9Q|5.0|This a great soundtrack.  Brings back the memories, makes you want to get up and dance and of course, watch the movie again.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|It is such a delightful album great to have so many hits on one CD. Such a fantastic singing voice to listen to.
B0006GAOJA|5.0|Is there any role DeNiro can't play? This guy is unbelievable in this role. Or should I say completely believable! His pain comes at you like a freight train! You best get out of the way or you'll get run over! Awesome!
B005HPY8LU|5.0|I love how each album is different then the previous, love the strong message in this album no pun intended.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Gary Cooper at his best in a true story and about a truly great and brave man! Alvin York was a real, true hero! A real live person who just did the right thing and never thought of himself out there on the battlefield. he saved his men and captured the Germans! His inner conflict with &#34;that thar book&#34; and the war is just amazing to watch. John Ford was a genius!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|It's a story from the begin to the end.  The emotions in the writing and singing is exactly how I felt while in my 20's and I imagine most of us all felt this way during that part of our lives.  This is my second copy I wore out the first one.
B000SW4DLM|5.0|&#34;Bladerunner&#34; is a truly great sci-fi film. It looks at a very interesting possible future which is, to me, all too possible. When is anyone's guess but I see it being a possibilty. Some of the things are a little far fetched but not beyond the realm of imagination. Genetic engineering is just now in it's infancy but in the furure...who knows.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|If you love Hot Fuzz and wanted to update your library of movies to blue-ray, you can't go wrong with this title.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|Now that was some combination! And it show's in this Oscar winning film and on the AFI's Top 100 films of all-time lists! Three of the greatest actors in Hollywood history. MacMurray was always very underated in his expansive career. It's a pity to. Of course Jack and Shirley are great here as always. Miss jack!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Graphics were convoluted, hard to.control  game playing creativity and strategy poor ..wasted gift card money on an exaggerated  recommendations very disappointed
B000CNESU8|5.0|We're not gonna take it anymore! That should be the people's mantra! Stand up and shout it to the rooftops! Can you hear us corporate world? Walmart? General Electric? Exxon? Toyota? All you politcains out there? It's time for a change in this society and we're not gonna take anymore! Dream on!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Great for readers who enjoy fantasy, mythology and mid-action humor.  I have read every book in the series (as of 9/12/2013) and look forward to more from Kevin Hearne.  In the last year I have read over 60 books in this genre, Hearne's are at the top of my list.<br /><br />This is a fast paced action packed book with humorous dialogue, creative settings and powerful mythic beings.<br /><br />Warning for readers who are squeamish, some of the battle scenes go into a fair amount of detail.  As with all the scenery in Hounded, the bloodshed is vivid and easily pictured.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|This is one the greatest films ever! Fonda and eveyone in this film give Osacr worthy performances. John Ford shows why he was one of the greatest directors in history. Ths story by Steinbeck is just awesome and touching and real! Hope nobody ever has to go through those times again.
B001V7UXG2|1.0|I love this series, but the footnotes said that the dvd was &#34;closed captioned&#34; they are not. Charming as an English accent is, its difficult for the American ear.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Is there a role Hoffman can't play? This is one of the best and funniest films ever made. Everyone in this film is awesome! And I do mean awesome! FUNNY! FUNNY! FUNNY! and touching too!
0425238091|5.0|if you haven't read this, what are you waiting for? if you're in the medical profession it's a must to help you relax, and if you are not, you get a look behind the scenes. prepare to be scandalized.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This picks up where the first one ended except it's in New York instead of Chicago. It's basically the same as the first but I ain't complaining!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|A five star show.....two thumbs up, way up!!!!  I like the fact that this show goes in multiple directions and then it comes to together somehow someway....outstanding!!!!
B000002J1U|4.0|Some good songs but not great. Got it with the other 3 albums in the first four albums they released. After ZOFO I left the train. The other stuff just wasn't for me but the first four were! All hail Jimmy!
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|I am disgusted by the decision by Paramount execs to split up the bonus features on this title among retailer exclusives, meaning that if you want all the bonus features created for this film, you have to buy it 3 or 4 times.  Shame on you, Paramount.  You have completely lost touch with the fans that turned this series into the success it is.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's well written and  it kept my interest throughout. I hope there will be more.
B00003CXA6|5.0|They don't make historically accurate movies like anymore.  I wish they actually filmed the 3rd part of the trilogy after Gods and Generals but the brain dead American public isn't interested in these kind of movies.  They'd rather see Miley Cyrus twerking.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Google's Chromecast is, for the most part, a good cheap alternative to the Roku, Apple TV, and Google TV. However, it also has limited functionality for now, as the only apps it natively supports are YouTube, Google Movies, Netflix, and Google Music. Apps like HBO GO are currently not natively supported, though there have been unofficial efforts from Android developers to expand its functionality to other apps (which were subsequently disabled by Google due to concern over QC). Anyway, the apps that it supports work very well with it; once you install the Chromecast app on your Android device and have all the relevant apps updated, as long as you're on your WIFI network you'll see a little streaming television icon at the top (phones) or bottom (tablets) of your screen. Just click it and then it'll begin streaming to your Chromecast.<br /><br />Setup is very easy. Just plug into an HDMI slot on your television and then if your television also has USB ports, plug it in with the included USB cable. If not, it also comes with a wall adapter. If your television is far from your router, the Chromecast also comes with a small WIFI extender. Then just turn on your television and run through the setup program, which basically just consists of having it recognize and connect to your home network. Have a computer or mobile device at hand for this part of it. You'll have to do a similar setup on your mobile device once you've installed the Chromecast app.<br /><br />Once it's running, the Chromecast takes no effort to run. It automatically turns on when you switch to the appropriate television input, and it slowly goes through a slideshow of beautiful scenery and backgrounds. It is actually nice just to see these beautiful pictures displayed on your television if you've got a big screen HDTV. Then, again, just use one of the apps mentioned above and begin streaming. You can also stream webpages from Google Chrome on your computer once you install the Chromecast extension. There is supposed to be support for iOS but that hasn't happened yet. Hopefully Google will get support from other companies as well besides Netflix (HBO, Amazon, etc.).<br /><br />One of the biggest pluses is that once it connects to your mobile device, it takes the load off and streams over your router. What this means is that it doesn't result in any noticeable battery drain over what you already have normally. I can watch a 22-minute show on Netflix and my (almost) two-year old battery in my Galaxy Nexus will go down 2%. Your mobile device essentially just turns into a remote once the Chromecast begins streaming. It also awesomely allows you to use your device normally while streaming. That means that you aren't tied down to the \\"remote\\" functionality while streaming. You can let it run in the background (still available from your status/notification bar) and go on texting, emailing, etc. if you want. These two features alone, the extremely low battery drain and the ability to keep using your mobile device normally while streaming, are fantastic.<br /><br />Basically my only gripe with the Chromecast besides the relatively low amount of compatibility as of writing is that I seem to have an occasional issue where, when I turn on my television and it goes to the Chromecast splash screen, the screen flickers a bit. Then on occasion when I am playing video the audio will cut out and I'll have to rewind. I have tried unplugging the Chromecast, resetting my router, etc. and don't know why it does this. The router is literally six inches from the Chromecast so it's not a connectivity issue. Hopefully it will get ironed out soon.<br /><br />Google, please keep working to bring other companies into this. I would guess that lack of HBO GO is a big sore spot for many users. It would also be great if Amazon would develop some video apps already and stop trying to be proprietary to its Kindle line (at least they have an app for Roku and for my LG smart TV). For now, should you buy this? If you don't care about HBO GO and don't use Amazon Prime, then yes. Do not hesitate. It's only $35. If either of those is really important to you and you don't want to sign up for Netflix or make purchases over Google Movies, then you may want to wait until this has some better functionality. All in all, though, this thing is amazing and amazingly priced.<br /><br />Edit: As I was reminded in the comments section, you can still stream \\"unsupported\\" programs through Chrome on your computer, these are just not supported by actual built-in app compatibility.
1594204217|5.0|this is a must read for anyone into food - does that exclude anyone? I'm going to try the bread.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|What a series, so many characters and treachery.  I'm addicted to these books and cannot stop reading.  I've only read the 1st 1.5 books of the series so am looking forward to the finish.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I am currently reading Bossypants. I am finding it to be an entertaining and thoughtful book. I would recommend this book.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Love it. One of her best cd's. The more Iisten to it, the more I love it. Buy it now
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I like that they made the show true to the writing of the books.  I'm enjoying reading until I get to see what happens next. Very interesting stories. Would recommend for anyone who may have missed some parts of the story line on the show.
B003FM1MNO|5.0|What is not to love! Enjoyed renting this to watch with my boys and my wife, who had fallen asleep the first time through due to being an incredibly wore out pregnant mamma.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|A really good film, very enjoyable, a very well crafted film and one the whole family can watch. A real sleeper. If you enjoy suspense and who done it films, then this one is for you.
0765325950|5.0|I do not want to end the legacy that has become a major part of my life. I have this on the shelf still unopened even.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|this works great on my kindle fire! I use it every morning as my alarm clock. I pretty much use it all the time for timers for dinner or to remind me of something! I love that you can use your own ringtones.  With the exception of the calendar this is my most used app.
B009ANP4F4|3.0|Ok, I like this movie quite a bit. It is not my favorite of the Step Ups, but the dance sequences are amazing. I do wish there were more individual dances, and less large group dances, but they were still stunning. This DVD does have special features.<br /><br />The reason why I gave it three stars is because of the DVD packaging. When I first received it, I was a bit concerned that i had purchased a bootleg version accidentally. The case is a clear plastic case with a sleeve that goes over it with the cover image. The case itself is not very sturdy.

B009LDD1X0|5.0|My dad loves this show! I gave him the dvd when it arrived yesterday. He will watch it b4 the weekend over,over,and over. I saved by pre-ordering. Thanks Amazon.com
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I must say I started reading this book since I follow Maryse.net's blog and I almost like all the books she likes. This is not my usual reading but from the beginning it sounded really interesting.<br />It is difficult to talk a little bit about the story since you have to read it to understand how 3 different stories then get together.<br />At the beginning it is a little bit complicated to understand all the stories and all the characters but then you get the hang of it.<br />The best part for me was the Epilogue. A really good ending...<br />I've never read books from this author before but I guess I'll start reading them.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Package was in excellent condition. This is a gift for my son-in-law and daughter. They love this show! They will let me know if it's not right!
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a fun game and addicting.  It's like playing darts with a golf ball.  The controls are good but take time to master.  I've only played for a short time but I like it.
B001M6KTLG|2.0|Really?  This could have been good... I mean not the preface, but Shia could have gotten the reins to the IJ franchise, but everything was just uninspired.<br /><br />Yes, Crystal skulls are real and found all over in different civilizations. That's about as far as the good part of the script gets.  I would think now maybe Josh Hartnett would be a better choice if they plan to continue on with it.  Indy's nephew, maybe?<br /><br />If you've watched the other three, prepare to be disappointed.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a great show! Love the cast! Julianna is really fun to watch! I loved watching Matt (Cary) on Gilmore Girls, and he is just as great here!
B001O6W9QC|5.0|You need to watch it.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much, but the cast is fantastic and it is really well done, the jokes are good, the cameos are good, it's really a classic and worth a watch.<br /><br />It's also the first time I saw Danny McBride in something and I was like, who is this guy?!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Whether looking at it on the computer or on the Kindle, Pinterest is the best website around for all kinds of ideas!
B00F4PVFE6|5.0|This show is really riveting, hard hitting and emotionally complex. I'd highly recommend it to anyone. I can't remember the last time I've been so impressed by a detective story. Gotta hand it to the British, they sure know how to tell a story without all the Hollywood fluff.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is very easy to use and a nice quick reference guide to how my battery is doing.  Great for free!
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This is a fun game.  The different characters you are introduced in game play are also interesting.  I downloaded this as a FAOTD and it stayed on my device.

B008XG1X18|5.0|This is by far one of my most favorite apps ever.  So much you can learn and look at through this app, and it is great helping you come up with ideas.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|I originally chose this so I could play some of the games from Facebook on my kindle. It didn't work, took up a lot of space, and made my kindle crash a lot. I uninstalled the very same day I got it.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|i said so. it was terrible. you couldn't see anything, build anything, or do anything but die. I hated it.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|I've been reading about this one for quite some time, so I've been eager to see if it's the real deal. Anything starring two Oscar winners in a two-person film should be impressive.<br /><br />Directed by three-time Oscar nominee Alfonso Cuarón (\\"Children of Men\\") with a script by Mr. Cuarón and his son Jonás, this science fiction thriller takes us to outer space where a medical engineer and an astronaut become untethered from their crippled space shuttle.<br /><br />Drama ensues....<br />  * Sandra Bullock (\\"The Heat\\") in the role of a lifetime, is a brand new space technician with only six months of training under her belt. As the publicity says, she has recently lost a young child and is trying to cope with her grief. Her language still reflects her life with a young child: when confronted by some confusing options, she automatically says, \\"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...\\"<br />  * George Clooney (\\"The Descendants\\") is the flight commander. He is a major chatterbox: funny, informed, and very smart. He consistently uses humor to diffuse the situation. I still want to know what happened in New Orleans at the Mardi Gras!<br /><br />My biggest problem is with credibility: that Russian Soyuz station is within visual range, as is the one from India. On the other hand, the special effects that illustrate the lack of gravity are exceptional. Objects which float away or drift into view remind us what a boon gravity is for us and why zero gravity is such a challenge. I tend to find films of this nature unsettling, and this one is certainly no different. BTW, that parachute was a nightmare!<br /><br />Amazon will notify me when this is available on DVD.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love this game. Very addictive. I just wish that you could trade sand dollars for pearls. You can buy pearls but you don't have a lot of opportunities to earn them.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|it gets you hooked right from the beginning. very suspenseful and exciting to watch. Both actors balance each other perfectly!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Oblivion was thoroughly entertaining from start to finish.  It had action, suspense, mystery, you name it.  I wasn't expecting to love this movie, but I can't stop thinking about it.  Definitely worth a rental!

B001D09OAI|5.0|A classic! Can't go wrong. it's hilarious and Very well made. I've watched it countless times and it doesn't get old.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|The boys are back with soulful tunes and rich harmonies. It's different to their pure pop style of old, but fantastic nonetheless
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read. Aside from the obvious sexual component people talk about it's a strong story. Couldn't put it down until I finished
B00846REIS|5.0|I have enjoyed reading Sylvia Day and her series.  I will be purchasing more of her books.  Can't wait for more!
B002ELM5HY|4.0|I am a huge fan of this artist. This collection was a little more country style than usual and I prefer it a little less. Still I am very happy with it and have enjoyed listening to it.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|This record exhibits Bob's continuing ability to produce unique and original material. Some of the songs are in a style unlike any he has produced before in my experience. Very Bluesy. I like it. I know some who don't - but they are not big fans.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is the most fun game I have ever played. I am completely hooked! This is the first time I have ever played Bingo on line. I would recommend this game to anyone that is a bingo addict.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Highly recommended.Very profound and wise. Is a story of unconditional love. Dogs obviously have a deeper understanding of certain things that we do, and this book is one extrapolation from that thought.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|This game was little more of a challenge compared to the original version. It took a litle bit to figure out how the birds flew and how to get them to go in the right direction. Once that was figured out it was a very addicting game. The only thing I didn't like was there was a preview version. Once you were hooked then the preview version ran out then you had to purchase the game in order to finish the rest of the levels.
B009UZBLSG|1.0|Maybe I got a bad unit, but it was completely up to the fates whether or not it would actually display my signal. On the rare occassion it actually worked, it wouldn't last long. I went for a refund instead of replacement, maybe you'll have better luck.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show is great. The shows still stars the same characters but Amy and Bernadette become main characters as well (as you can tell by the cover).
1419705644|5.0|I got this for my best friend and she read it in one day. She loves the book and the information.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show is definitely my favorite comedy on tv. It centers around three physicists, an engineer, and an aspiring actress that lives across a hall from two of the physicists. This season introduces Bernadette, Amy, and Wil Wheaton to the show.
B00004R84K|5.0|It's good and the best greatest movie and its very funny and I watch falling down a lot I'm glad
B003L77G6A|5.0|In this season Amy and Bernadette become closer to Sheldon and Howard as well as the group. Leonard dates Raj's sister in several of the episodes at the end of the season. Penny has a difficult time seeing Leonard with someone else.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Was the best thing that's been made!!! I have been addicted for months. Everyone needs to try this app. It is addicting
1401235417|5.0|This story line is one of the best that I ever read. The two books that follow this one are:<br />1. Batman: Night of the Owls<br />2. Batman: The City of Owls<br /><br />The Nightwing story is a good story to go with this as well. Those books are:<br />1. Nightwing: Traps and Trapezes<br />2. Nightwing: Night of the Owls
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Honestly this is truly the best book I have ever read. The only thing I wish had come out of It, is if John green would write \\"An Imperial Affliction\\"
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This mystery show is a modern adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. In this series, Sherlock Holmes is a recovering drug addict. He resides in a home in New York owned by his father. Due to this, Holmes father hires a sober companion (Joan Watson) to ensure that he stays sober. Holmes is reluctant to comply at first but he must follow Joan's rules for staying sober if he wishes to remain in his house. After a very short time, Joan is eager to help Holmes with his work and a partnership is formed.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is about 3 physicists, an engineer, and an aspiring actress that lives across a hall from two of the physicists. This show is one of the best on tv.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written. And I hope this can inspire others to believe they are not alone.<br />Especially given the authors background. I wish he worked at the hospital I work at.<br />Thank you for giving me hope.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show centers around 3 physicists, an engineer, and an aspiring waitress that lives across a hall from two of the physicists. If you have not watched any episodes, this is the place to start and it is definitely worth trying.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The history in this show is a realistic portrayal to the brutality of the times. When civilization was about conquering other people. This is not a candy coated endeavor. The violence is graphic and not for everyone. The acting is fair.<br />This show is not for everyone. But if you like historical fiction portrayed more realistically than usual especially in the visual rather than written word. I would recommend this series.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This season starts with Howard in space and endures several problems from inside the international space station and from back at his home. During this time, Stuart starts to hang out with the group outside the comic book store more often and continues to a few times through the season. Two recurring characters are introduced as well. Those characters are Janine Davis of the university's Human Resource department and Sheldon's assistant Alex Jensen. One major turning point for the characters is that Raj learns how to talk to women without the use of alcohol in this season.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I like that this series takes me to places I will never be able afford to see in person. The characters make you root for the good and page turn to see the evil defeated. I cannot wait for the next book. Great story telling!!!
044024238X|4.0|Fun! Quick read, but very entertaining! I was sad to see it end! Great beach book or to relax after a rough day at work.
B0054N73EY|4.0|I'm With You is the follow-up to the amazing double-album Stadium Arcadium, finally released in 2011. This is the tenth album from Red Hot Chili Peppers, who were just inducted into the Rock 'n' Rock Hall of Fame. John Frusciante, who was a huge part of the Chili Peppers' best work, is not present in this record at all, having left the band to work on other projects. This creates a lot of suspense for the sound of the album, as Frusciante has been replaced by his good friend Josh Klinghoffer who is in his mere thirties, a nearly twenty year gap in age from the other three band members. When Frusciante returned to the band after his drug addiction in the late nineties, he brought this new inspiration that revitalized the energy and sound of Red Hot Chili Peppers. Thus, the band produced one stellar album after the next, starting with Californication. So it's pretty understandable why some may be worried about John's absence and what this does to the band themselves. I will be rating each track from GREAT to BAD depending on my opinion.<br /><br />1. \\"Monarchy of Roses\\" -GREAT- The distorted verses are the first thing that come to ear, which has been heard from the band since their One Hot Minute days. Then, the song explodes into a disco-rock chorus. Though different from previous songs, this song is great nonetheless because of its creativity and has never been done before by the band. Josh's solid guitar work in the bridge of the song shows that there is nothing to be worried about in the new Red Hot Chili Peppers.<br /><br />2. \\"Factory of Faith\\" -GREAT- Flea's bassline kicks off this funky song. It's definitely reminiscent of the Chili Peppers' older song. I really enjoy Anthony Keidis' vocal delivery in the song, solid and going along with the bass. One thing that isn't as good in this song is the guitar work, which is somewhat drowned out by Flea's bass until the outro of the track.<br /><br />3. \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" -GREAT- This song is just amazing. The touching lyrics are mostly written as a death letter from someone named Brendan. At first, it seems like an acoustic ballad. But then the drums kick in, and then the guitar riffs and bassline. Finally, Keidis starts shouting and \\"Brendan's Death Song\\" becomes a distorted garage-rock melody with so many sounds to listen to. At this point, the emotions really kick in as the song begins to slow and come to an end.<br /><br />4. \\"Ethiopia\\" -GREAT- Once again, Flea opens up the song with bass. Then Anthony starts singing the vowel sounds \\"E-I-O-I-E-I-A\\" that turns out to be the catchiest part of the song. The chorus is pretty good too, although Klinghoffer doesn't get much of a part until the guitar solo-bridge of the song. Even so, this is still one of the most memorable tracks on the album.<br /><br />5. \\"Annie Wants a Baby\\" -GREAT- \\"Annie Wants a Baby\\" tells the story of Lucy Reibart. Though exactly what the story is about, I can't tell you, as this song contains the same classic, ambiguous lyrics that are trademark to the Chili Peppers. I feel like the drumming stands out a lot in this song and really carries this song along with the vocals.<br /><br />6. \\"Look Around\\" -GREAT- Another amazing track, with everything great about the Red Hot Chili Peppers pumped up to the max. The drums tear through the silence at the beginning of the track, paving the way for the bassline and guitar riffs. I love the builup in the second half of the bridge, with Keidis spouting the same unintelligible lyrics he loves before hitting up the last chorus.<br /><br />7. \\"The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie\\" -GREAT- Just a solid song all around, complete with cowbell and catchy chorus. This is another song that is hard to figure out exactly what it's talking about.<br /><br />8. \\"Did I Let You Know\\" -GREAT- In this track, the narrator has feelings for the other after a one-night stand. The music varies a little bit, with some trumpets and a strange voice changer in the chorus who makes whoever's singing sound like a woman.<br /><br />9. \\"Goodbye Hooray\\" -GREAT- One of the most powerful tracks on the entire album, and is especially fast-paced until a strange psychedelic bit preceding the last chorus section of the song. And also, there is an actual bass solo, which is awesome, by the way.<br /><br />10. \\"Happiness Loves Company\\" -GOOD- Pianos cue off this track. At track ten, we finally reach a song that just doesn't stand out that much. There's not a lot to say about it because of this. But it's still pretty good with some chanting backup vocals in the chorus.<br /><br />11. \\"Police Station\\" -GREAT- I really like the sound of this song at first, it being a nice, slow change of pace from the rest of the rest of the album. The chorus could have been better, in my opinion. The piano bridge/outro is absolutely great, though.<br /><br />12. \\"Even You Brutus?\\" -GOOD- What a strange song for this band! Starting off with an old audio sound, Anthony bursts out with a combination of shouting and rapping backed by a piano loop. The chorus is definitely more traditional Chili Peppers than the verses, but the song really grew on me. It's actually very catchy and stands out quite a bit from most of the other tracks, just for its uniqueness.<br /><br />13. \\"Meet Me at the Corner\\" -GREAT- Another slow song that I really enjoy. Everything about the verses really remind me of the slower side of Stadium Arcadium, from the vocals to the short guitar riffs. Once again, the strange, feminine voice distortion is used in the song, keeping it from getting too repetitive at points. The song also picks up towards the end, with some acoustic tracks and just overall great guitar work before ending.<br /><br />14. \\"Dance, Dance, Dance\\" -DECENT- The final track starts out with a quieter bassline than in previous songs and leads into the song. I don't really go for this song as much because it seems kind of out of place. It also doesn't really have any redeeming qualities about it and ends up becoming kind of forgettable. On some of the verses, the way Anthony sings really reminds me of old Kings of Leon music before their mainstream days.<br /><br />I have to say this album surely surprised me with its overall solid build, even with incorporating more experimental elements into the music. Following up Stadium Aracadium's massive 29 tracks was an incredible feat, but the band showed they could do it. I'm With You is definitely a worthy album in this band's discography, and shows that there is nothing to fear when guitarist Josh Klinghoffer is here. Well...for the most part. After 25+ years as a band, the Red Hot Chili Peppers still got it. I give it an 8.5/10, rounding to 4/5 stars.<br /><br />I hope everyone knows this is just my opinion!s singing sound like a woman.<br /><br />9. \\"Goodbye Hooray\\" -GREAT- One of the most powerful tracks on the entire album, and is especially fast-paced until a strange psychedelic bit preceding the last chorus section of the song. And also, there is an actual bass solo, which is awesome, by the way.<br /><br />10. \\"Happiness Loves Company\\" -GOOD- Pianos cue off this track.

0978606310|5.0|I have over 400 G1 My Little Ponies, and this is an invaluable encyclopedia of all the My Little Ponies produced in the 1980s.  It's great to check off what I have and set goals for what I want.  The book is organized well, the descriptions are good, and the pictures of every single available pony are high quality and clear.  It's a bible for any true collector.  I believe they also have books for G2 and G3 collectors as well.<br /><br />Two critiques:<br />1) This only covers US Ponies, so if you're into collecting international ponies, there is no information on those sets in here. I'm not sure if there's another book that covers that.<br /><br />2) The pricing on the various ponies can be completely ignored. This thing was published years ago, and prices on ponies have risen substantially. Don't rely on the price guides in here, just use it for the information.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Amazing, it was everything I expected plus more. I highly recommend it if you love supernatural. You should also check out season 5.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Running Time approx.  562 min. Sound HD 5.1 (High Def. Picture).  This movie series is absolutely stunning! Its high end production at its best. The acting, period wardrobe, theatrics, sets and all special effects are spot on and to industry (A-list) levels of quality and standards. However, be (warned), those of you who have families and kids under the age of 16. This movie hides NOTHING!  So be forewarned. It has bouts of porn woven throughout the series. Example: full on male and female nudity, including gay sex acts, lesbian sex acts, orgies and lewdness acts. This movie is also extremely bloody and gory to the 10th power. So if you have kids, be wise and purchase with caution. I'm just being honest. Otherwise, this movie has everything a man could ever want, no disrespect to the ladies out there. It's a great series hands down, and is a (5) star production, however, it's just not for kids. Thanks guys.  Buy on Blu-ray.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was trying to find the calculator on my Kindle and a friend downloaded this for me.  I love it!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This calendar is great. I have multiple Gmail accounts and I wanted a calendar to incorporate all of the various calendars and this does that without any problems.  It is easy to turn any individual calendar on or off of display.<br /><br />I have the paid version. The widget for the free version did occasionally give me troubles, but the paid version works flawlessly.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I started playing this game at 9:00 pm and couldn't stop until 2:00 am.  It's a fun challenge that kids and adults alike can enjoy.  Creativity at it's best!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This weather app works flawlessly on my kindle fire hd. The forecast displays are easy to use and clear. My only request is for an option of 15 more minutes of loop time in the weather maps.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Kids and adults enjoy this game!  It's funny, challenging, and a great past time!  I also have Angry Birds.  Great games!
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|I have 3 boys ages 3, 6 and 10 and they all like to play with it. The 3 year old likes to put the bands on in patterns, the 6 year old can make the bracelets all by himself and the 10 year old likes to figure out the more complex bracelets. As stated in previous reviews, the directions are a little confusing, so adult guidence is required for the younger children but nothing too difficult.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Once again Megadeth has put forth another great effort.  This is solid, straight forward heavy Metal that any fan of the genre should appreciate.  From the first song, King Maker, to the final one, Cold Sweat, you get more than what you paid for.  In fact, Megadeth's cover of Thin Lizzy's Cold Sweat is one of my favorite songs currently.  If that song doesn't get you motor running then check your pulse because you are probably dead.  Buy this CD and if you get a chance to see them in concert do it.  They are amazing live.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is very funny and is a quick read. The main character is impossibly well traveled. You may need to refresh your memory on the people he meets as it is also a step through world history in the 1900's. Very witty and well done.
0345803485|5.0|I loved this book!!!!! The love story is amazing. I was a little uncomfortable at first with the sexual parts, but got over it when I realized the chemistry Ana and Christian have. The only thing I disliked was all the emails. I would of thought that they would of texted. All of the to: and from: stuff was a little much!
B00000JTB2|5.0|If you like gitar blues you will love this CD.  Never mind the two headliners - who deliver incredible performances - even the backup band is tight.  The folksy dialog between several of the tracks adds to the aura of this incredible pairing.  Mostly this sounds like two good friends having the time of their lives playing together.  Highly recommended.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Well-written, clear and very informative, this little book about diet, lifestyle and approach to living is enjoyable to read, and it can be extremely effective.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I havn't watched this yet, but I seen it on TV and it was a very interesting story about George Harrison. I can only say I wish I could have known him. What an interesting person. I had to have it because I really do want to watch it once more. I have loaned it out for the time being.
B004MDLXUW|5.0|I finally decided to give this a read after spending three years of watching the TV show. I shouldn't have been surprised by how amazing it is. Though Game of Thrones is very true to the source material, there is still so much missed. George R. R Martin is definitely a masterful storyteller and it would be a shame to not read this book.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|I downloaded directly from ES File Explorer's site.  A day later, when I opened ES File Explorer, a message appeared stating that I did not have an approved version and that I should visit the app store and download.

Next day, same message about not having an approved version.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does what you need it to. Easy to use, but has enough extras to make it worth the purchase. Reliable. And the weather part is a nice addition if you want to get a little summary at a glance. The App probably has more that I haven't explored.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I'm afraid that my review will not do justice to this movie.  Temple Grandin is a high-functioning autistic who is able to communicate why she has the reactions she has, the feelings she feels, the physical adaptions she takes (such as spinning, rocking and avoiding eye contact), and how she thinks (she thinks in pictures and therefore does not do well at all with abstract thinking).  It is fascinating to see her fall to pieces and understand exactly what she is feeling and why.  Her mother is instrumental in helping her achieve to the highest level of education...a doctorate!  Temple is the best in her field of designing slaughterhouses that keep the animals calm and happy up to the last minute.  She completely understands the animals and is able to translate that into improving slaughterhouses world-wide.  You can see how and why interpersonal relationships are so difficult, if not impossible, for her...but the few people she is able to connect with manage to help her understand us and how to maneuver through the world so much better.  This is a movie you really shouldn't miss.  It can help us all understand people with disabilities.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The storyline is good. Many of the events are unexpected. It's enjoyable but it is hard sometimes to reconcile the class differences. I understand that the situation in those days was: Everybody knew their place and what to do.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I've had this thing for three weeks now, while some people have mentioned the pulse missing 3-7% of their steps, in my case it only is recording 3-7% of the steps, missing the vast majority of them. This results in some bizarre numbers like having climbed 2450 ft in 1200 steps! (I went on a 8 mi, 3450ft hike that day). Customer support claims software issues, but with little-to-no information on when they're actually going to fix it. Avoid this product for a good long while, they clearly needed to test their software a lot more before releasing it.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love it! Great show and the DVDs have great extras and behind the scenes items. If you haven't seem it you should! I'm watching it again and it still makes me laugh out loud.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Watched this movie not to long ago, Kind of caught me off guard, not Clints usual type of movie, this one had a differant type story line, but it kept my interest all the way through. Delt with situations you pretty much see on a regular basis in our world today. Peer pressure situations in a rough neighbor hood, the ending took me completely by surprise. I won't give it away, but if you enjoy Clint Eastwood the way I do you really need to see this one as well, Clint never lets you down.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Any Downton Abbey fan must have these. I've watched them over and over. A truly unique collection and can't wait for the rest of the episodes to come out.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|\\"Oh my God this was one scary movie,\\" the creepy cabin in the woods, the whole thing just creeped me out, if you haven't watched this movie yet, and you love scary horror movies, you have to purchase this one, It will scare the living crap out of you! If you get a chance though by all means watch it on the big screen at your local theater as well, for added thrills. Nothing like a big screen to bring out the best in a movie. This one does though truly creep you out, alot of surprises along the way. So by all means purchase your copy today, you won't regret it!  [[ASIN:B00DHNB5CY Evil Dead (2013) [HD]]]
B004W2V254|4.0|Kept me entertained from beginning to end.  The mountain climbing scenes dominate the movie and were convincingly realistic.  The 1930's period portrayal was quite believable and lent authenticity to this true story that has a tragic conclusion - not your typical &#34;feel good&#34; ending.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Sad story but a well done view on one living a life completely dependant on others & a good perspective on the families views & unwillingness to let go.
091581112X|1.0|This book tells us about about reaching your higher self, using your imagination. He doesn't define &#34;higher self&#34;. Maybe it's another ego level.<br /><br />For me,  my Real Self is eternal and created by God. It's not a figment of my imagination.  This book comes from someone name &#34;Orin&#34;, who I've never heard of and could be just about anybody. My spiritual guides are people like Ramakrishna, and his disciple Swami Vivekananda. Both have realized God and give us clear instructions on what we have to do.  Jesus also told us what we have to do to reach the Kingdom of Heaven, although the Bible distorts much of what Jesus taught.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Nice summer reading, interesting and fast.  A little out there but I still liked it.  Would recommend this book to read for pleasure.
140006922X|5.0|Zealot confirmed things I have read by others who have studied the &#34;historical Jesus: but organizes it is a way that is a bit easier to understand - more as a narrative.  I think it would go over easier in a church Sunday School Class for adults or teens.
0321928482|5.0|Great companion book of other Lightroom 5 books. Excellent for hands-on learning experiences in a classroom-type format that really works.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought this was a fun game, challenging enough to keep you thinking, but not so hard you get frustrated and lose interest.  It was a good way to pass time while waiting for various things.
B00DWZHTRW|1.0|Warning: Spoilers<br /><br />Horrible movie about revenge through completely unbelievable suspension of disbelief. \\"You drove my dad to kill himself, but I'm gonna plan for 30 years to get my revenge when you're an 80 year old man\\" is basically the whole plot of the movie. Additionally, according to the movie we live in a world of holograms, real time Satelite tracking, but not in a world of security cameras or competent security and FBI members.<br /><br />To that effect, you're telling me that a secure place holding a safe with $500,000 has a staff so stupid  they don't notice the installation of a giant mirror, or when they run up to it they don't see their reflections, or have any security cameras?<br /><br />Also, who was setting up these massive installations for the magicians? Like the ending scene in 5 points has choreographed light installations, and Hologram technology Star Wars would envy lol. \\"Oh it's cool, we just threw it up there, took 5 minutes\\"<br /><br />Then for the big dumb ending somehow the whole city knows where the party is, except the FBI is running around saying \\"OMG where are they going to be next?\\" Then when the FBI does finally show up at the right place they don't put the area on immediate lock down.<br /><br />But it's cool, i'm sure a 12 year old boy had the foresight to see 30 years ahead to know that he would eventually go to school, spend years of training to become an FBI agent, become a prominent agent, be put on the case of magicians stealing money that he also orchestrated, so that he could avenge the death of his father against evil corporations and Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />This guy's 6th sense is so amazing it give Emperor Palpatine a run for his money. If he could see into the future like that, he should have just picked the lottery numbers. LOL Maybe that's how he paid for all the hologram technology. (Redletter Media Reference for those of you who watch).
B005LJETYI|5.0|Really liked this story and am rapt to hear they have made a movie of it.<br />It was very clever
B0033H7VI6|4.0|I love the knife so far except for two things<br /><br />- it has a thick handle so if your hands are smaller, It is a &#34;bit&#34; unwieldy.<br /><br />- Manufacturing issue:  The point has an uneven grind.  Looking down from the top the edge is a bit lopsided at the point.  I will have to grind this out.  An since the knife is so thick, its gonna take a while.  Even so its still a nice knife at the price, just a bit of quality control needed from Schrade.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So much fun. So addictive. Love this game. A definite must buy for people who like temple run, minion rush, etc. This game is one of the coolest things that I have played, and I love being able to play my friends on Facebook.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|Heard M83 couple of years ago and WOW what a show! When I saw Oblivion, you know leaving the theater that you are going to want this soundtrack, simply amazing! You WILL NOT be disappointed with this album!
1401923127|5.0|Helps us realize how thoughts and beliefs work for or against us.  Broadens our view of our views!  Recommend to everyone trying to figure out how they come to the conclusions they do!
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I have read this book many times over the years. I like this edition as it doesn't contain the errors (typo, grammar) that another edition I had contains. I also enjoy the illustrations; they add another dimension to the story.
1401902197|5.0|Louise Hay is a terrific bundle of positive energy who teaches the rest of us how to cope with and view the world from a better perspective.  Whatever Louise Hay produces is worth having in the house as it radiates positive energy...
B00785P2QC|4.0|If it didn't revolve around facebook, I would have gave it 5 stars. But great game overall. So much to do in it!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Really fun movie, witty, and good Saturday afternoon movie. Liked that it didn't take the roles to serious and allowed for the quirky commentary, while giving the action expected.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I love this series. It is one of the top action game series on Amazon. If you like the Diablo series or the Baldurs Gate series these games are for you &amp; probably the closest your gonna get to those games on Amazon.
B00D6BQG1W|1.0|Sorry, but this movie just didn't do it for me. I may have chuckled once, but that was about it.
B00CX7TOTQ|4.0|In true typical Travolta fashion he plays the part of a sneaky but no so bad guy in a film not offering great room for not being anything else.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The seasons keep getting better. I enjoy the scandals and the constant development of the cast members. The shows writer is not afraid to kill the characters off either.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Another opportunity for Tom Selleck to show his true ability as an actor to portray a small town chief of police bringing big city ideas to solving murder and mayhem. An extremely good series and worth having in your collection.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I loved watching it years ago and enjoy it just as much watching it now. Traveling through space on the Starship Enterprise and its crew takes me back to when I watched it when it was on tv. A must have for all Trekkies out there.
B009AMAJVO|4.0|Your typical Colin Farrell type movie with plenty of blue language, lots of action and at the end of it, not much substance in the storyline, but good all the same if your looking for blood and guts.
B00DGL3IKY|5.0|I was waiting for this dvd since two months ago... great concert!!! and I love to have the AUDIO CDS in my car.!! \mm/
B000Q6ZG5C|4.0|Another absorbing journey through Harry Potter's never ending search for finalisation of his mission in life and of course the adventures within adventures along the way.
B0024CEY36|4.0|I have read many, many of Ken Follett's books.  I found this one of the hardest reads.  I struggled thru the first part and nearly bailed out which is something I don't do wit a book.  Stayed with it until the end.  The last third of the book seemed typical Follet to me.  Table set and now the good stuff.  I am glad I read the book and of course will continue reading Ken Follett.
B000Q6ZG5M|4.0|Once again an enjoyable adventure through the medium of film about Harry Potter's never ending search for fulfilment of his dream for completion of his mission.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Nice to have all the movies in one case, lots of great extras too! I would recommend it!  Great product for the price.  No defects!
0385340990|4.0|I read this book twice and decided I had to own it. It left me wanting more of both the characters and of that period of history as well as the location of the Channel Islands.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This movie offered a different story line than many with some surprises which was refreshing.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book it was my first time reading anything by this arthur...I felt like I was part of the story kept me wanting more.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|The movie had lots of action which was no surprise but sometimes there were parts of the plot that weren't explained or developed enough to be believable.  Entertaining but not stellar.
B0025CS2GU|5.0|This is a movie you'll watch over and over again until you have it memorized and are reciting the lines from the movie!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|After reading the selection I was curious as to how the second book could be equally good without becoming mundane, redundant, and boring.<br /><br />However, Cass has done an excellent job of weaving a story that kept me in suspense and on the edge of my seat. I have no finger nails left after reading this book!!! I was constantly swept up in a tide of emotion and felt almost as indecisive as America herself, unsure who I was mad at or rooting for from one minute to the next!!<br /><br />I am eagerly anticipating the third and final book of this series and am lamenting the fact that it will not be out until May 2014!!
B005LAIHRC|5.0|When I first heard of this movie I was, to say the least, skeptical. Then I saw a spot on TV with Alec Baldwin rocking out to a Poison song and my mind instantly said \\"I must see this movie immediately.\\" I even convinced a friend to go see it with me and he was, like me, skeptical. However, two hours later, we were both laughing and singing the songs out loud. This is one of the best movie musicals in years and neither the cast nor soundtrack disappoint. Tom Cruise's Stacee Jaxx is a brilliant, if more than slightly jaded, rocker and his performance is just the tip of the iceberg. The chemistry between Diego Boneta and Julianne Hough is enjoyable, as is the over-the-top aging rockers portrayed by Baldwin and Russell Brand. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Paul Giamatti make great villains in the tale and Malin Akerman rounds it out with sex appeal and sultry pipes aplenty. The movie plays out as a believable love letter to the 80s rock scene and the film will have you rocking from beginning, featuring Guns & Roses' Paradise City, to the rousing finale of the appropriately placed Don't Stop Belivin'. I highly recommend this film to any movie lover, especially music lovers.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|How could a country girl resist Blake Shelton? Boys 'Round here is my absolute fav! My daughters and I have listened to it at least 50 times now. Ordering was flawless and shipping was quick.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|The newest Star Trek has raised the bar on Trek awesomeness and should be given ten stars<br />Great action packed conflict and adventure.  The Star Trek crew, loved by us all, have gone out<br />on a new adventure with great high tech thrills and yet still have remained true to their beloved characters<br />How you worked this magic is beyond artistry but I love it and Khan did not disappoint, wow!
B008K93302|5.0|Until I got this app I couldn't figure out home to retrieve my downloaded movies.  Now I can watch movies when not connected to the internet.  You just go t o ownloads on  the menu screen and your download movie or whatever will play.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This was a great purchase.  Seeing this timeless classic in all it's glory. Still one of my favorite movies.  Excellent quality.
0803726570|5.0|This is one of the best children's books I have read recently; the rhyming quality was excellent; the illustrations were absolutely wonderful.
B0002EXH54|3.0|would be better if we were still in the 80's. plus matallicas ride the lightning and master of puppets blows this clean out of the water. it's funny how people say metallica stole daves sound in what way, maybe kill em all sounds similar.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I bought this DVD as requested by my son who is 7 years old.  He liked it very much as well as Despicable Me 2 which we watched the movie in cinema weeks ago.
B00CVCHJ6I|5.0|I don't really like melodic death metal but this is good. probably the best melodic death metal record since At The Gates's Slaughter of the soul.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Crooked politians existed from BC to current time.  I would not recommend for anyone that doesn't like blood/murder in front of their eyes.  I loved this season as the saga continues showing the corruption of that era.  Steve Buscemi is great as lead in this series and when I saw him in Grown-ups 2 playing a comic roll, I had to really laugh.  This is one series I will definitely watch over and over again.
B0002EXH40|3.0|some of the lyrics (not singing) are more aggressive than the actual music itself. it's hill billy metal. I cannot listen to it all the way through. guitar riffs on train of consequences are the only thing going for this record. from countdown to this seems odd.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I watched it at the movie theater when it came out, and recently wanted to watch it again after seeing its sequel (Red 2) on the big screen as well.  Recommended!
B00DVXVMT6|5.0|I wasn't blown away by it just impressed but it's definitely chimaira rejuvenated, although with all new members except mark. I never thought daath members would be in chimaira. I always liked daath's music I just don't like their vocal style. If you doubt this new lineup of members you'll be impressed when you hear it.
B004SIP9Z6|5.0|Some movies are so deep, so subtle, you can watch them over and over, and pick up something new every time. Sin City isn't like that. Flash Gordon was my former number one guilty pleasure. When I watched it, and now, when I watch Sin City, the fun comes from seeing the same things each time: when I hear Marv tell a guy \\"That's a nice coat you're wearing,\\" I know the guy's in big trouble. Although it never happens, I half expect to hear Marv tell Cardinal Roark, \\"That's a nice robe you're wearing.\\"<br /><br />Maybe I shouldn't call it a guilty pleasure. Siskel and Ebert both gave it thumbs up, but this movie aims at being low-brow. Usually, good drama comes from good villains. Sin City villains are all one-dimensional. They are bad, mean, nasty people. They run everything, run over everyone, and have an exaggerated sense of justification for what they do. We want them to die slow, horrible, painful deaths. As Marv puts it \\"I love hit men. No matter what you do to them, you don't feel bad.\\"<br /><br />While the villains do whatever they want, the heroes: Marv, Hartigan, and Dwight McCarthy are all driven by a strong sense of obligation. They can't just walk away from the situations they're in. They have to squeeze some justice and fairness out of it; at least, they have to try. Marv is the one most willing to do monstrous things, but, despite the fact that he has \\"a condition\\", he's also the one who most clearly spells out what people should or shouldn't do.<br /><br />Sin City is a graphic novel put in motion. The story telling uses graphics and plenty of violence. There's violence, but it isn't gratuitously displayed. The most violent parts are masked by graphics or related to us . . . \\"it wasn't until I showed him all those pieces of himself. . .\\"  In addition to masking violence, the graphics set a tone and context that straight cinematography won't give you. Right in the opening scene, the rain makes an appearance that sets a tone and tells a story.<br /><br />The graphics pull us into Sin City's unreal world that has very real people in it. That's why I visit so often.
B00BR4QNJ0|1.0|They dont help with hackers and u pay for everything with real cash if u wont anything i am taking this game back off it is bull
B006G3JQ78|2.0|My 5 and 7-year-old granddaughters were totally bored once it went into the animation. Maybe it was cutting edge for the time, but our young ones didn't like it at all.

B00CFNUMD0|5.0|We love and all (kids and grownups) enjoy Shaun the sheep- the animation is great! And the stories are unexpected and fun.
B003Q97D48|5.0|My daughter was watching this and told me I would like it I was not sure I would since im 49 and this show is about teenage girls. well I was hooked from the start couldn't stop watching would watch hours at a time and now that I just finished the last season im missing it terribly and cannot wait for more episodes to watch...I cant find anything else that compares to this...each episode leaves you wanting more and wanting to see what will happen next!
B00EOFF5I4|5.0|As a big Ellie Goulding fan I have always wanted her to do faster &#34;get pumped&#34; songs- &#34;Burn&#34; is awesome!

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret was an easy and enjoyable read.  The story was well written and kept me interested throughout.  It had a decent ending which I find rare.  It did not seem like the ending was a rush to eet a publishers deadline but seemed to be well planned out.  Great vacation read on the beach.

B0047SF41G|3.0|Plot is slightly different and a bit -too far into not believable-but has very good acting but not a powerful or developed as original cast, and the has the &#34;required female&#34; that does a good job of not being feminine, but usual sweaty t-shirt stuff.  Enjoyable to guess who will die next and the end is a bit of a surprise.  Worth watching.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|Special affects are wonderful, but the storyline was very much like so many other movies!Don't buy it, just rent it.
B000OVLINI|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, it will keep you guessing till the very end! It is written beautifully, and anyone who has been to Barcelona can say the author has captured the magic and haunting brilliance of that city. The characters will grab you, and the plot will never seize to entertain you as your transported a world away. This book is thought provoking and pulls your heart strings. I adore this book.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I have only had this App for about a week but I think it's going to be a winner.  You can see what the weather is in your location, including not only temperature and precipitation, but humidity, wind speed and direction, amongst other things, including what the hourly forecast will be.  And by making a quick change you can see an icon summary of the weekly forecast too.  (This is in the &#34;word&#34; mode for the forecast.  The other &#34;clock&#34; modes have most of the same info and are nicer to look at too.)  One nice feature is the background (to all the modes) that shows a representation of what the weather outside looks like depending on what it is doing and what time of day it is.  For example, if it's partly cloudy and the sun is setting, you can see clouds moving across the screen and the light fading.  Heck, you don't even have to come out of the basement!  One other great feature is the ability to plug in other locations and see what the weather is where you might be heading.  If you are at all into the weather, I believe you'll like this App.
B00280LYIC|5.0|You should definitely read this book! It's so good that I can't explain it!! Percy is so daring and brave!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is already so perfect, being able to use it on a mobile device is added bliss. Works great on the kindle fire, with clear images and great controls. Its free and wonderful to an incalculable degree. I love it.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I use this for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and I LOVE it. Works amazingly; very simple and slides in your pocket along with your phone. The built in micro usb is a very great feature; very useful. Even comes with an adapter for iPhones (4s and below). It doesn't come with a lightening adapter for newer iphones/ipads but there are very cheap to buy separately. I would recommend this to anyone with any mobile device they wish to charge.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|Good acting, Bizarre story-line but worth watching. Not sure if I would recommend someone to purchase this movie. I wish I would have just rented it from a Redbox. I based it on Amazon ratings and now I own a movie I will probably never watch again.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Excellent read,couldn't put it down. All of Gillian Flynn books are phenomenal. I enjoy how every detail she mentions all comes full circle in the end.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Very informative and thought provoking. It helped me to understand why people act the way they do. Great insights on how to truly give love to your spouse.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I had the same version of this cable with the older iphone 4/s connector and it lasted two years before failing. The lightning connector version lasted no more than two weeks of regular use before dying. There must be better options out there.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I am having fun playing this game.I would refer my fire day and family to get this game,it keeps you going for hours.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Loved the view from Dave Grohl's aspect of the industry.<br />Plus a review of all the musicians that walked the halls of the studio.<br />It really is a shame how technology has changed the industry and put a lot of these studios out of business.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book reads like a textbook for a college class on interacting with people outside of your norm.<br />Should be on the list for anyone studying anthropology, psychology, anything with people, and the understanding of them.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This has become my secret treat to enjoy when all else on the tube fails miserably especially after prime time has been reduced to reruns.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Works great, very bright light and good sensing. I use it at night instead of turning on the bright overhead lights.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I really enjoy this music. I'm disappointed there are only 5 songs but I'll enjoy them while I have them.
B002E0JL4A|4.0|My wife recommended this movie and so I rented it.  I was entranced by it and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The struggle of someone who truly loves people and wants to make a difference and how the system is designed to prevent that.  I like the fact that the principles of &#34;Patch Adams&#34; are applicable to many vocations, not just patient care.  It definitely points out how we disregard and overlook that customers or patients are people first, not numbers or statistics.  Everyone wants to be treated like a human being.  And, of course I love Robin Williams!  He creates such fun, passionate characters.
0374530718|4.0|This book is truly fun. Perhaps it takes a bit of maturity to enjoy, however, since I loathed it in high school. Ten years later, I picked it up and could barely put it down. A great mystery, and a neat way to teach all about philosophy.
0375704027|4.0|I read the comment about the different translations of this story which makes perfect sense. I am multilingual myself, plus noticed in terms of dialects translators or translation offices (in cases of movies) are sometimes terribly lost.<br />The only thing I thought was, in some ways it is also interesting to read this book in a bad English translation. If you live in Japan you notice that some Japanese people of course don't speak perfect English and it could make it sound authentic for the price of loosing actual meaning of a word. So it depends. I should try reading both versions to get an informed opinion.<br />I like the story very much. The only thing what I always feel reading Murakami, but especially in this story, is how he applies himself sexually to women. It is in a rather non-emancipated way from a very old-fashioned male situation. I live partially in Japan, but am younger than him, so I know as a fact that many Japanese from the younger generation are very sensitive and skillful lovers that have a good understanding of the connection between a woman's body and mind, but when I read Murakami's sex scenes I always feel he must be absolutely clueless and think having sex with a woman is like driving a car.<br />Usually I am not so bothered by that and focus more on the story, assuming \\"OK, he is simply that type of man.\\"<br />But \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is a story about a young woman who slowly goes insane with her lover helplessly looking on, not knowing what he could possibly do to help her. A big problem for this woman is her being frigid with the exception of only one occasion, where she found herself previously aroused BEFORE she met her lover.<br />When she talks about her sexual encounters or when Murakami in the role of the narrator talks about what the sex scenes or attempted sex scene look like I almost feel like bursting out laughing and crying at the same time. The girl has no sense of a sexual identity and her needs, and since teenage age on she seems to think her role is to actually jerk her lovers off at any price, and her two lovers seem also, although both deeply in love with her, know of no other way than immediate intercourse without any waste of time to create a romantic mood.<br />This sex style is very old-fashioned.<br />Reading this story and the problematic explained in it seems to me like reading a Grimm fairy tale that starts with \\"There were once a man and a woman who desperately wished for a child, but they didn't know where to get it.\\"<br />One would hope that these days we all know where to get children, and we all know what we need to orgasm and how to make that happen in a woman. It seems Mr. Murakami does not exactly know that, but is lucky(?) enough to only encounter women who are already impressed by him being a famous writer and that is sufficient arousal.<br />Otherwise the story is very interesting.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a great quick read and the book was perfect.  John Green really let the characters come alive with his vivid imagery.  I would highly recommend it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book shows that all of us around this earth have the same desires and needs in life....love of family, neighbors, friends.  Everyone should read this book, perhaps the world would be a better one if we could see that we are all so much alike.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|Probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The plot, the characters, the music, everything about the movie makes it one that many should watch.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I love Avenged Sevenfold so much and this is a seriously underrated album. I would definitely make sure you pick this one up!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i makes me think.....but i would like for this game to give the option of harder levels because the easier levels, in my case, i leave for my 3 year old daughter to play...thank you
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It does what it's supposed to but gives about as much light as a app. It also kills battery power. It's ok I guess.... but basically just a battery killer. I would just use an app.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It doesn't let you go to the next level that easy.i like a challenge. will keep playing until i figured it out
B00E3D7WGU|3.0|Another tour, another live album release.  Madonna and company have certainly realized the value in selling the audio portion of her concert films.  However, with each tour, it seems the allure of an audio-only version gets less and less.  MDNA World Tour (the live album) is disastrous.  I didn't think Madonna's camp could get any lazier in producing these.  This is nothing more than a straight audio rip of the Blu-ray/DVD release, complete with the intro sound effects (not part of the concert) and the camaraderie that's shown during the end credits.  No effort was made to optimize this for an audio-only format.  And worse yet, it seems no effort was made to optimize the sound mix either.  This album sounds like a cheap bootleg.<br /><br />At least the songs themselves (if you can stand the bad mastering) are pretty fantastic.  The album's best moments are those that are the least processed, such as \\"Candy Shop\\", \\"Express Yourself/Born This Way\\", the brief \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"Love Spent\\" and \\"I'm a Sinner\\".  Plus, the cool arrangements  of \\"Hung Up\\", the afore-mentioned \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\" are definitely worthy of repeated listens.<br /><br />The MDNA Tour itself was downright flawless, so it's a shame we got such a low-quality recording.  I'd tell you to check out the Blu-ray/DVD instead, but the defects in this audio version seem to be magnified greatly on that package with horrible video quality and a flat-out defective audio track...but that's another review.  Buy this album if you must, just don't expect the best quality.  They should've gotten the guy who mixed The Confessions Tour to do this one as well.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|My favorite book I have read this year!<br /><br /> It took me three sittings to read this book because I would only read it in the evenings because I didn't want to scare anyone. I think I went through 2 boxes of tissues. What an amazing heartwarming, heartbreaking tale. Lou and Will whom would have never met otherwise are brought together because of an accident that happened to Will. Lou is hired after losing her job as Will's caregiver / companion. As the book unfolds you see how Lou and Will relationship grows and becomes something very beautiful. I laughed and cried. It's a book that will stick with you. Loved it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Try to find the items that will help you get out of each room. This is not just a hidden object game; no list is given which only adds to the challenge. And some  of the needed items seem irrelevant, hmm, but maybe they're not??? This app feels like a fun game, but it also forces you to &quot;think outside the box&quot;...pun intended!
125000098X|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books of the Clifton Chronicles.  The third book was lame.  While I enjoyed the election coverage, the South American/Don Pedro storyline was not interesting nor compelling.  And the ending?!  Ridiculous.  I'd throw the book at the wall in anger except that I listened to it.  I was ripped off by Jeffrey Archer.
1439152802|5.0|I LOVE Kate Morton.  I have read all of her novels and this one, the Secret Keeper, is by far my favorite.  It has been at least a year since I read it and the story has stayed with me.  Morton definitely has a formula but it happens to be a formula in which I can get completely lost.  You won't regret the time spent reading this great story.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|fast moving and clever. had me guessing all along. would recommend this movie to anyone. hope sometime in the future for a sequel.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Not enough Bingo's, always fighting with the wife as to whom will get on first.  All i all GREAT !!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Read it you won't be disappointed this book is part of one of my favorite series they Percy Jackson series I also recommend this book too
B005QYKD4I|3.0|The special effects overwhelm the story and made it hard to follow.  The two main characters are not very convincing as a couple.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I 16 years old and was blown away by the intense boot camp scenes and what I imagine what real war footage would have looked like in the Vietnam Conflict. I just saw this movie recently at the age of 38 and it still had the same effect on me.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I still enjoy the show, but the ending was dumb. It didn't have the emotional impact it could've because it was a result of the character acting dumber than they have been portrayed the last three seasons.
B00006IUIG|5.0|A Fellini Masterpiece.  Simple story, incredible dream sequences.  You'll probably need to watch it a few times to figure out what is real and what is dream....also to enjoy the qualities brought to the screen by Marcello Mastroianni and Anouk Aimee (before &#34;A Man and a Woman&#34;).
B00AFEY354|5.0|The cast is so young and the talent of these young people amaze me. If CGI IS YOUR THING DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.  But if you want a movie almost true to life with believable talented actors who breath life into story. I suggest you ran out and get a copy of &#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; now.  I 'm sure this film will became a classic.  Go, find out for your self...go on.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Redo's of the concept throughout the years do not really compete with the original.  Best to watch the &#34;real thing&#34; - one of  Michaelangelo Antonioni's masterpieces.  Full of tension and suspense - and if you  haven't seen it before much surprise.  Great roles by David Hemmings and a 1966-young Vanessa Redgrave.
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|As with any other book touching upon the Farseer family, I was unable to put this thing down. This final book in the trilogy is very well written and will have any fan of these characters on the edge of their seats. If this is truly the last work surrounding Fitz and the Fool then I can be content with the final actions involved, but of course I'd love to see even more from this wonderful world that Robin has created.
B008MWBY6W|2.0|I got this free with a camera purchase so I shouldn't complain but...to small I have absolutely no room for anything but the camera
0062238868|5.0|Great story with some goofy fun moments as well as the cold hard reality of modern warfare. What a bad a$$ this guy was! Glad he was on our side.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I am not very articulate but I will attempt to give this app the glowing review it deserves. I am particularly taken with the appearance and that coupled with the many features make it easy for me to give it five stars.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|A wonderful read full of great character development and a beautiful story line. It will be a good book club discussion on so many levels .
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is fun to play.  The puzzles are not too hard to figure out and yet they do present a challenge.  I hope they add more floors to this game or make more games like it.
B009JZPH32|5.0|I've always loved gangster flicks and this one is definitely up there with Kill Bill and Natural Born Killers for me. How can you not love Scorsese? Everything about this movie is great, and it gets better every time I watch it; definitely recommended.
B003MYYJD0|4.0|Beautiful watch. Good value. And very unique styles.<br />All are 'large', some much too much so (unless you've got arms like a gorilla!)
B00CKR63F2|5.0|The characters in this story are interwoven nicely as the search for a long lost love continues.  Natives are able to shape shift into any type of animal that they desire as the battle continues against the evil Ala who is intent on destroying the mystical realm before moving on to the mortal one.<br /><br />At almost 400 pages in length, this is no short tale.  The plot is nicely developed and different perspectives are used to give the reader a nice look at what everybody is thinking when they perform a certain action.<br /><br />If you are interested in the fantasy/mythology genre, then consider purchasing this book.<br /><br />Here's something else that you might like:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00ETHO3JE Walkers: The Battle Begins (Book #1)]]
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Fast way to kill time on the road just keep watch of your data usage. I love UNO but it better with real cards
B003TOMAPC|3.0|Kick ass was ok but I liked Kick ass two a lot better. The plot was better in Kick Ass 2.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It fun and funny just all you expect from Minions. Then as you continue to play the game the same process happens over and over and over again. Just not enough to keep me entertained
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Few films have ever touched my as deeply as this one.  I cried several times.  Pixar is unique in the power of their films, and this one was no exception.
1619690039|5.0|The first book I've listened to by this author, it was awesome. The narrators were excellent.  I'm looking forward to listening to all I can by this author. I enjoyed the characters of Puller and Sam. The story was fast paced and energetic.  There ends up being a lot more to this case than solving the murders. Multiple layers of villians.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Few films have ever approached the epic scope of this one.  I left the theater feeling exhausted and elated.  I have referenced this work like a great epic of literature many times since.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. I found it to be truly addicting. If you are looking for a game that requires using your mind, this is it. Please develops more floors, ten were just a tease.
B0049J0DC8|4.0|This movie came early in the Pixar phenomenon, when they were still getting into their swing.  Still excellent, and a precursor of things to come.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Les Miserables, known to most people as Les Mis, is a musical recently turned movie. With actors such as I Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfreid, and Anne Hathaway how could this movie not be amazing?<br /><br />The actors sang live with the orchestra laid over them, allowing them to better convey the emotions. The movie was filmed in France, with some scenes being filmed on a sound stage and others being filmed on the streets of France, giving it a more real feel. With many intertwining storylines including love, war, redemption, self-discovery and rebellion, Les Mis has something for everyone.<br /><br />Whether it's the phenomenal actors, the jaw-dropping music, or the overall storyline, Victor Hugo's 'Les Miserables' has been turned into a timeless masterpiece.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This was a great film, deep, entertaining, and inspired.  It reached further than most films will dare attempt, and achieved.  Very much a down-the-rabbit-hole experience, but with more guns.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|It was a fun game but it took forever to load on my kindle and it froze my screen up a lot
B009LRE040|5.0|Many times I have been asked which of the new batman movies I liked best, but I cannot tell.  To compare them is to choose between apples and oranges.  Both are good, but they are too different to be compared.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Incredible and diverse. These guys are now my favorite band.I love eighties hair and metal, and these guys do it all plus new fun twists.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|While not better than the books, this movie has the distinction of being an excellent conversion of a great epic into film.  Very exciting!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is awesome and totally worth the price, I mean, it's only 99. Cents. This game is a fun adventure in your hands with surprising and interesting new levels as you stretch your brain to get the candy to your very own pet, on your tablet.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This film changed the whole face of movies by attempting to make a superhero seems almost real, bringing gritty realism to the world of DC and opening the door for more reboots.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I tried several times to configure this on my home network and failed. I contacted Google support, and they had me reset the unit to factory defaults and I tried again to set up. I got a message informing me that I must have a router that supports UPnP to use the Chromecast. My router (Cisco ASA 5505) doesn't support UPnP for the very good reason that it is not secure. I have returned the Chromecast.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|A solid, fascinating time travel story, replete with action, romance, and a strange sense of the unknowable.  One of the best stories of its kind.
B00EZH0C5M|4.0|If you could see the future, could you prevent it from happening? Or would events somehow conspire to make it come true?<br /><br />That's the question -- never quite answered -- that lies at the heart of \\"Minority Report,\\" a tightly-plotted, well-acted sci-fi movie that dabbles in chronophilosophy when it isn't bouncing through intertwined murder mysteries. Steven Spielberg's direction is tight and dramatic, the actors all do excellent jobs, and the one downside is the lackluster fight scenes.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant future (next Sunday A.D.), murder is no longer a problem in the Washington DC area. The PreCrime Unit uses three \\"precogs\\" to predict where and when a murder will happen, and apprehend the murderers before they have a chance to kill.<br /><br />Ever since his son was kidnapped, Captain John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has thrown himself into his PreCrime work. His faith in it is absolute, even when the justice of it is questioned by a clever young auditer, Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell). But then one of the precogs sees a vision of Anderton committing a crime: in 36 hours, he will shoot a man he has never even met before.<br /><br />Like anyone else, Anderton immediately goes on the run, hoping that there is some way that the precogs could be mistaken about what will happen. His former partners and coworkers are all trying to hunt him down before he kills, but they aren't able to keep him from kidnapping the precog Agatha (Samantha Morton). Is Anderton doomed to his fate, or is the future not what PreCrime thinks it is? And who has set him up?<br /><br />You can't really have a story about knowing the future without delving into the whole \\"free will vs. determinism\\" debate -- are we masters of our own fate, or will the future unfold as it was foretold? While it only lightly touches on the debate itself, \\"Minority Report\\" hinges entirely on those questions -- and while obviously it can't answer them entirely, it wraps the story in twists and double-twists that swing it both ways.<br /><br />Spielberg's direction is tight, sleek and fast-moving, and he tosses in casually cruel touches (the eye-scanning spiders) that show the lack of real justice in PreCrime's world. He also shows that he's pretty amazing at making a murder mystery, twisting together some seemingly unconnected murders with a truly plausible precog-related motive. Everything makes sense by the end.<br /><br />The movie's biggest problem is that the action scenes just aren't that good. The most ludicrous one is Cruise and Farrell fistfighting in a car factory as giant deadly robot arms assemble a car AROUND CRUISE, followed by Cruise simply driving out of the building. Yeah, that won't need fuel or anything.<br /><br />As for Cruise, he's pretty good here. He's playing the same character he usually plays -- a pure-hearted yet tormented man fighting against the Big Bad System, and his flaws (addiction to a drug I didn't really understand) don't detract from his heroism.<br /><br />Honestly, I was more intrigued by Colin Farrell's subtle performance as Danny Witwer -- a quiet, religious, intense man whose sense of justice is needled by the existence of PreCrime, and whose hunt for Anderton makes him realize that there's more going on here.. And there's a ring of other excellent performances -- Samantha Morton's ethereal Agatha, Max von Sydow, Neal McDonough, and the wildly underused Kathryn Morris as Anderton's estranged wife.<br /><br />\\"Minority Report\\" is a solid, sleek action movie draped in a mantle of philosophical ponderings, and only the clumsy action sequences bog it down. Even if you're not a fan of Cruise, this movie should be seen.ists that swing it both ways.<br /><br />Spielberg's direction is tight, sleek and fast-moving, and he tosses in casually cruel touches (the eye-scanning spiders) that show the lack of real justice in PreCrime's world.

B0049J3QNG|5.0|One of the films of Pixar's golden years, this movie defied the rule of sequels by surpassing its predecessor in depth and intensity.  Good for children, great for all.
0061122416|5.0|I decided to read The Alchemist after seeing Will Smith talk about it so passionately in an interview, I wasn't dissapointed.  A very simply story line about a boy following his personal legend, discovering along the way many things about life, love and the meaning of life.  Wonderfully yet simply written with many beautiful messages peppered throughout the reading experience.  Left me with a warm fuzzy feeling in my heart by the end and I truly hope it gives you the same experience.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|This was the worst thing that could have happened to this series.  Not only does it utterly undermine the original series, it isnt even a good movie in its own right.
B008469DGY|4.0|fun, but it is more like &#34;driving accuracy&#34; than golf, Needs putting and more shot angles and hazards. Some issues with loading.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|While it undercuts the perfect continuity of the original, this film excellently repeats the success of the first, but with more excitement and a higher budget.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It will keep you wondering.  Morton is a great writer.  I read it slowly because I didn't want it to end!
B001AT4Y84|3.0|I didn't enjoy this one as much as the first two, though it was at least generally better than the fourth.  The time-travel assassin v. bodyguard trope wore too thin.
0143124544|5.0|Don't judge a book by the cover. I have passed on this book many times when searching on Amazon for my latest read.  I've downloaded and read over a hundred books on Amazon in the past two years.  I can honestly say this book has been my favorite of all of them.  Me Before You made me laugh out loud, cry, and think of life in a different way. The author does a skillful job of keeping her reader guessing how the book will turn out.  I loved the characters and felt like they were part of me as I took a beautiful journey with them.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|I enjoyed this film.  It was at least as good as the original, and scratched the right comedy itch with the adorable minions.  Good for a boring Friday night.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|it simply does your homework for you. if your a kid out there and you absolutely HATE homework this is the app for you!!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game fun to play . Very addicted can't stop playing all day. You will enjoy playing this game challenging. Peace
B003DWU98U|5.0|Haven't seen this for years, but Taylor is as biting as I remembered her.<br />Chose her monologue for college drama class years ago.  Actually had to turn it off after a short time<br />as it was too intense.  Went back and finished it in two more sittings.  Love/hate retlationship.<br />Not for the weak of heart.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like the look but not quite sure how to work it yet.  Hopefully I can figure it out. Hopefully it is easy for me to get it.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|My daughter received these as a gift for her third birthday as well as the set with Sofia and her animal friends. The heads of the Sofia and Amber dolls kept popping off so I emailed Mattel. Three days later I had received replacement dolls in the mail. Excellent customer service. As for the fun value, my daughter loves to play with these dolls. She makes them dance, interacts the Mom and Dad with the kids etc. Sometimes my daughter asks me to help her stand them up, they do stand on their own but topple easily. I would say these would be great for any little girl who likes Sofia.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Loved it.  Good movie with I had seen it in the theaters. :(  wonderful opts for the purchase on line
0385505833|5.0|Funny! Empty nesters will relate! Not the usual Grishom--one of my favorite authors! The movie was also funny, but has a different title.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|who does nt love ad/dc i sure do i lost my 1st cd and glad amazon had one the cd came in excellent condition and the shipping was fast i am very happy with everything
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Proof of Heaven is an interesting read. I never doubted his sincerity in his writing. Some things were more difficult to get through, medical terms and explanations of the workings of the brain, not so much for me; I excused him because of his job :) . I knew the butterfly lady was his sister, I was glad he final found that out. I'd like to thank him for sharing a most intimate time in his life, and letting the rest of us experience heaven through his eyes. I will and have recommended this book to others.<br />Bobbi
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Tons of content! You can play for days and never get bored. I will not lie, on the higher difficulties this game is a real challenge.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I LOVED THE WAY THE MAIN CHARACTER EVOLVED FROM THE BEGINNING AND HOW SHE BECAME STRONGER AND FOUND LOVE AND TRUST...ALSO THE OTHER CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE REST OF THE SERIES..

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Good puzzles story line was intriguing and interesting. scene s were colorful. Short but fun. I enjoy these type of games.this one was hard to put down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Outstanding. The first episode of season one didn't draw you in but the second one hooked us. Please watch this great program
B004EPYZPI|5.0|Fantastic condition.  I'll watch forever.  I think this is the best movie, even beating out Sahara, with Matthew McConaughey. Bye.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Probably wouldn't watch it multiple times, but it's a great show to just roll through. Having so many episodes is a plus as well.<br /><br />The plot seems to be intact throughout the season and into the second...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This has been a great game so far!  Graphics are good,game is fun to play, objectives are realistic.  When I visit neighbors sometimes it tells me the neighbor vs upgraded to a newer version.  Having difficulty figuring out how to upgrade my version bit fun to play nonetheless.
B004SIP7AS|1.0|I am hearing impaired, why is there no closed captioning? I can't use this movie. All movies you sell should have that capability
1401307787|5.0|A very readable yet extensive overview of the concepts involved in mindfulness meditation. Includes very realistic exercises for those of us just starting meditation practices.
140006922X|2.0|I dont think I've ever given less than 4 stars in a review before, so I hope the author will accept my apologies. This is no reflection on your ability to write well. However, the author has a POV- and went a tad too far to push it on the reader. I found historical errors and numerous blind sights throughout. No new information or intellectual challenges--  Aslan should keep writing-he is talented- but it may be time for him to try a new writing genre..I like his style and would read more from this author-
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|They are still getting to know each other and it's pretty good. The cast are still a little still neck about there characters. But I know it's only going to get better.
0030839939|2.0|The book is good - I knew what book I odered. But I am really not fine with how late I got it and in what condition:<br />First it took way longer that first claimed when I odered it. I got a message of excuse, I appreciated that but that still did not made it ok.<br />Second and worse I did pay for a NEW book as it was described. And now I find pages where it is already written in and a rip in the one page... That really sucks.<br />You can do better then that Amazon... That is the first time that I am not fine with the Service, but I think this is really fraud.
B009NY43NY|1.0|(spoilers)<br /><br />I don't know what I expected since the last few books have been so disappointing, but this ending was just... bad.<br /><br />Harris has fallen into this really bad habit of \\"Sookie wanders around her boring day to day life.  Occasionally someone is mean to her, or she notices something is \\"odd,\\" but she doesn't think much of it.  Then all hell breaks loose in the last chapter or two.\\"<br /><br />This book was a lot like the ending of LOST- everything we had been promised the ending wouldn't be all along.<br /><br />Sure, Harris never said she wouldn't end up with Sam, but she spent how many books telling us all the reasons why Sam WASN'T an option for Sookie.  Are we supposed to forget all of those things now?  She also spent all of those books developing the world of vamps and whatnot, just to have Sookie bow out in the end and decide it's not for her?  What?  Again- am I supposed to get amnesia about all of the other books I have already read?<br /><br />I could go into detail about the problems with this book, but so many others have already done so.  I'll save my breath.  I just wished I had saved my $.  I wonder if Costco would take the damn book back....
0955153077|4.0|Even though I know it's used, it's too dirty like it was is soil or something!<br />But overall it's as good as new, except for the latter.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson plays it all the time. He even tried to show me how to play<br />Glad I got it
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|It is cool fun awesome and amazing this is a good app get it this app is good it doesnt waste your time
0399159347|4.0|An interesting journey as the lives of the characters converge.  Well told story that kept my interest through to the end.  As a side note - the season's switch was especially interesting to me as a North-American.  In Australia, Easter comes in the fall.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|this is one of my favorite---all-time favorite films! I saw it  when I was in school back in the 50's---this very same original cast==--and loved it then. I am a francophile, French speaker, and a student of that very complex culture of post revolutionary France, as well as an art history bush. The story of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec  has always fascinated me. Once when in Paris i was fortunate enough to catch a show of his works. He was the greatest innovative artist in the history of art, in my opinion. It is a film filled with vibrance and color, fantasies and fact and any art lover  cannot h elp but enjoy The actors were truly well-fitted for their parts. Jose Ferrar did a msgnificent job as  the lead character. F<br />Gabor was her sparkling self,.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 is a well written, mesmerizing show!  If only all shows were this good!  You will not be disappointed!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game that gradually increases in difficulty, but so far hasn't become frustrating.  Challenging and entertaining.  Very addictive!  If you like &quot;The Room&quot;, you will enjoy this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.  Sometimes I can't win but I win with a little conniving.  I use this to fill in quiet times.

B00CATSONE|3.0|It was quite short, but informative.  I assume there is not much information about him because of the efforts to silence him.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Comfortable, wireless, good sound quality, programmable buttons, sturdy, great included software and the ability to sound like foamy the squirrel - all at a nice middle of the road price compared to the &#34;professional quality&#34; options out there.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Every chapter had easy to do experiments and kept the momentum going. Its not something new but is dfly packaged well.Will dfly recommend to others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is awesome I love the new oufits and the new characters. this is defenetly my cavorted app . bye
0553103547|5.0|This series has become an obsession for many with good reason. An epic tale of magic, steel, honor, and treachery. The beautiful and the grotesque intermingle until they are indistinguishable. Martin delivers a truly unique and immersive experience.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|The app works as advertised, certainly an improvement on the Kindle 's battery management. I was surprised at the length of the calibration, not to say it improved performance but it gave very accurate information which I like.
0553801473|5.0|Book 5 of the ASoIAF is great. Neglected characters from Book 4 are back and facing new challenges. Martin has not failed to keep the story exciting, and the ending paves the way (as usual) for the next book in the epic tale.
B00003CXAE|5.0|It was great taking you back to the good old 50's the cast did A wonderful job the songs and thesinging great especially the main two cast members this in my point of view all alright.
0553108034|5.0|Book 2 of the ASoIAF series is equally (if not more) exhilarating as the first! I continue to be totally enthralled.
B00005JSGK|4.0|Based some where in africa the duke with red buttons and others catch animals for zoos around the world,and along the way have some fun and romance and other things.But I due believe it could of been done A little better in some parts.
0553801503|4.0|In an effort to flesh out the ASoIAF universe, Martin neglects some of the favorite characters and introduces some new ones. At the first the reader is a bit disappointed but if you give these new characters the same attention you gave others, you will find them interesting and the ultimate experience will be rewarding.
6305736650|5.0|What can I say,Bogart in Casablanca was over the top his best part.Suspense around every turn not knowing who you can trust.The kind of film you wish you were in,the cast was excellent especially when they used the language of the country they where from.A very excellent film for everyone to enjoy.
0553106635|5.0|More surprises await the reader in this 3rd book of the ASoIAF series. Affection for the characters shifts and changes in strange ways, sometimes leaving your moral certitude in a quagmire. If you've read books 1 & 2, don't stop now!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Nice game...time consumer for those days you don't feel like doing anything but are bored not doing anything! I like the little characters and the interaction. Plyd on kindle so interaction is even better.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|One of my psych professors incorporated the website in a lesson a couple of semesters ago &#34;From Conception to Birth&#34; TEDtalk, and I have been watching it ever since. I am hoping I would have come across it eventually if I didn't go back to school :-) Youtube, TEDtalk: very valuable :-)
B003JTHWPA|3.0|It was slow to get into and slow to finish. Some characters really developed and others just hung in the air. Easy to read but not something I loved and would recommend
B003VW54QO|5.0|John Wayne is the best.  Love his westerns.  He should have won more than one oscar. This movie is great not only because of the Duke but his co-stars especially Walter Brennan are great!
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|This battery is amazing.  I choose it because i don't want to have a battery case, I prefer the external Battery and the ability to charge the iphone, ipad or other devices.  This battery is perfect in size, weight, and lasting for that porpoise.
B000784WMW|5.0|When I ordered this I thought it was a movie, but to my surprise it was an 11 episode mini series from the BBC.  I enjoyed it because it did not dwell on the same plots as all the other movies I have of Jane Eyre. Timothy Dalton's version of Rochester was great in some cases you felt he was what all the other Rochester's should have been.  You felt he really understood what was being said it the emphasis was put on a certain sentence and made much more sence that other movies I have.  The only problem with Timothy Dalton was of course he ws too young to portray a man in his 40's.  I really enjoyed this series.
B009C7JS14|4.0|I like this app it shows you the current time and weather but id like if they show the 7 day forcast
0385523394|5.0|Watched this Netflix series and didn't want to wait for season two so I decided to purchase the book. Went with Amazon because it's a little difficult to find in stores PLUS it's cheaper on Amazon... LIKE ALWAYS! :) Great condition (BRAND NEW) and will purchase again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I refer to it daily! It's very accurate for my area! The radar maps are great to track weather that is coming. I would recommend this app highly.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The book reads easily and very understandable.  Just started and it is not that hard to do the fast, as the book recommends, as you know the next day you can eat normally.  Lost a little weight already.  Give it a try!  Good Luck!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|played the game until I beat vector and wasn't bord yet. can be hard if you fond have good reflexes I defenerly rate a 5 star for this game and worth the time of download : )
6303418287|1.0|This product was not Widescreen as it was described. I was specifically looking for a version of this film that had not been altered to fit a television screen.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of the greatest shows on the television. Loved the first season, and this season is even better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game it is a fun time useing game I am out words so I will write these random words.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pros:<br />1. Relatively inexpensive ($35) compared to other options (Roku, Apple TV,...)<br />2. Easy to setup (takes only 5 min)<br />3. Can control using multiple devices (smartphone, PC, tablet) on multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows)<br />4. Can stream anything on the Chrome browser (duplicating what's on screen)<br />5. Can cue up multiple play items<br />6. Doesn't consume battery on the smartphone (initiate streaming and move on to do other things or even put the phone in suspension mode<br />7. 3rd party apps will continue to make this device more useful and will eventually allow streaming of anything on the PC or phone to the TV<br />8. Tiny footprint that can easily hide away in the back of TV (if the TV has a USB port, then the device can be powered by a USB cable without a power supply connected to the wall outlet)<br />9. Can connect it to an audio device/receiver and stream Spotify or Pandora continuously without turning on the TV- this is a very good feature!<br />10. No additional service fee or subscription fee other than services that you choose to pay for (such as Netflix or Google Play)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Doesn't support any local storage media directly (you can connect the storage media to your PC/laptop or smartphone and stream from there if necessary, though)<br />2. No remote controller (you can use your PC/smartphone as a remote, though)<br />3. ... can't think of any more cons!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome. great for challenging the brain!! cant wait to play level 10 and up! its gonna be exciting!
0307720748|5.0|This a true story \\"Fountainhed\\" from Ayn Rand.<br /><br />ou know that books that tell how everything worked fine and the guys was sucessfull ? This is not one of these. This is a book about mistakes. That's right ! What amazes me so much was all the thinks that went wrong and how Mr. Branson managed to make it a sucess.<br /><br />You know, I read a lot of books, specially biographies, I love ti but it always are biased: like everything always goes well. Here is the beauty of this book: telling how he managed the failures. This is it ! Everybody know how to manage success. How to manage failure is another story. A story taht you don't hear in your MBA.<br /><br />If you want to know how to manage these failures you can open your company (well... believe me that's the hard way) or buy this book. I would suggest this second option for a start.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Cruel, tricky world with taste of magic. Dragons, magicians, blood priests, murders, sex, politics (a lot) - an impressive mix for reading!
B0016CVN02|5.0|I've been looking for a greatest hits compilation for the Stones and found this.  It's nice that it highlights their early work.  You can get the sense of the early British invasion sounds along with the bluesy feel.  If you are looking for a well rounded set of tracks, this is it.<br />I'm not going to go into the historical, mixing or technically correctness of these songs as a few others have.  Just put it on, sit back and enjoy it.
B006UV8DJS|4.0|Watching the colors change then the lighting and the texture  then you finish it all off with a fabulous frame
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Its my first buy as a kindle book, I add audio, very good, I will buy to many, this will be my hobbie now on. The book it's inspired, motivated and first of all talks about a human been like us but with very clear proposal in life, all the negative issues he turn in out to positive results not only for personal convenience but for all people in the world, he thought big and make big things in small size, like a plutonium, small gadgets with big and smart products for users, just the entire life of Steve teach us in so many ways to be a better person in this rock that we calls earth.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This whole series is awesome!!!<br />I read the first one from the library. I had never heard of the series before, but it was so very,very good I started the others on my kindle. (Now I have to buy the first one too!) The characters have depth, and will take you on a surreal journey! I cried in parts,and laughed in parts, and devoured them in days.,because I couldn't stand to put them down! Cassandra Clare is a great writer! Well done!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I heard them play a number of songs from this album at GOTV and they really pulled off the album nicely.  Great album.  Nothing more to say.
B004G606K8|4.0|First books by these authors I've read will not be the last. They transport the reader to another world. Loved the series
B000256TD0|5.0|excellent
B000FCKC4C|5.0|After seeing that it was on NY Times Best Seller list and seeing how it was translated and published worldwide I decided to take a look at the sample.  It seemed like a cute story so I bought the e-book.  I loved it!  It's a tale similar to Aesop's Fables where important lessons of life are learned along the way in obtaining a goal.  If you like these types of stories, then get it.  It is also worth noting that this story appeals to everyone of any age.  It's could be a great bedtime story to read to children a few pages at a time because there are lessons that learned along the way for the main character.
B004MSWLU8|5.0|This was just for my step daughter's school work, so of course we didn't hear much about the 'quality,' but I'm sure it was just fine.
B007REV4YI|3.0|Fell a little short of 007 expectations. Needed more far out action scenes found in most Bond movies. Still not all that bad.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love this Grisham thriller. Three of us reading it at same time in different formats.  We all totally enjoyed it.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|I like Michael Connelly. I have read all his Harry Bosch books, and all of the Lincoln lawyer series and have enjoyed them all.  An easy read that keeps you interested in the characters and the story line.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This game has tremendous graphics. While a little wordy at times, the story flows smoothly and the challenges are appropriate for people new or familiar with them. Never a pixel chase, but instead the graphics in all the games' variations were enjoyable and challenging rather than frustrating as in other Nevosoft and mother's games...bravo!
B00DU74U74|3.0|OK NOT THE BEST MOVIE  TOO  KID  ORIENTED<br />KIDS MOVIE<br />NOT FOR ADULTS<br />WILL NO WATCH IT AGAIN<br />NEXT<br />NEXT
B00CO52NLI|5.0|It is awesome although there's a quick test at the beginning of the game to take care of the animals and I q<br />would love it if you could take the dogs on a walk.MEGAN.Age:14
B005SV9X22|5.0|I missed her show because she had the hip surgery but this sort of makes up for it. There is nothing like seeing a performer live and from what I had heard this was a great  concert. I am waiting til she comes around again and hope the tickets are reasonable ( hear that Gaga? ) Another great entertainer and one that will be around for years to come..
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|GET THIS APP NOW there always making new updates and getting new vehicles IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THIS APP YOU HAVEN'T LIVED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002FOQXZK|5.0|Kid Cudi, i love this guy he an awesome artist and this is probably my favorite album of his, glad to have it finally!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game if really fun! Create your own pony town, real voices of the ponies, and a story along whith it! The only thing wrong is using gems to get ponies like rarity, and rainbow dash when you need them!! Gems are hard to get, and rare too! It would be better if gameloft made more gems in the game, or not make ponies cost gems at all! Other wise, this game is highly recommended.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|This was a purchase for my book club. I found it to be boring and unbelievable. I do not recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game it is free and fun for little kids I hope other people have fun on this game and your children will like ir
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I enjoy playing this game when I have some spare time to do nothing.<br />Other family members play it too and we compete with one another.
0451191153|5.0|I have allways been a supporter of individualism and an opponent to all mass ideologies. I have found this book a brilliant artistic elaboration of the same ideas. As an architect I am deeply amazed by the professional knowledge of the wrighter on the essence of architectural thinking and working methods. In one word: a revelation.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock met all my expectations an then some.  Love the sleep timer and ability to wake to music.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|I laughed when I heard Michael Keaton was going to portray Batman.  I was dismayed to see others take up the mantle in the later episodes.  These four offerings are the best of the Batman liturgy.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|When is season 3 going to be available. Just great show with many twists and turns can't wait till its on
B002XMGGK6|5.0|It's not often you can be empathtic for a wronged man, but in this case, be prepared to.  We've all felt like this hero.  Expect comedy and pathos in a well acted, well directed piece.  Root for the good/bad guy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Interesting concept of the future with likable characters and paced well to keep you going.  It should definitely be read as 1 book.
B001EBWIUO|4.0|This is, without a doubt, one of Bogart's best acting jobs, and the fact that it won the Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor Oscars is also testament to its excellence.  It's probably one of the best explorations of human greed ever shown on film, but that may be one reason why some people won't like it.  The film was not initially widely appreciated by the public when it was released, and if one is looking for a fun Saturday evening, this is probably not a good choice.  Bur for students of film and film acting, it's definitely worth a look.
0316017930|5.0|Excellent tread! I had not thought of these reasons for success. Gladwells's writing style is enjoyable. Goes to show that timing and practice lead to proficiency in ones endeavors!
B003UESJH4|5.0|This was a great picture of a significant period of English history, fascinating relationships, and a compelling story of personal triumph over adversity
B007XAYKX8|5.0|This movie picks up where the race coverage stops.  A little more insight about the racers, their families, friends and mechanics.  Few will ever be invited to be this close, so it's the next best thing.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I have read a little over a third so far and am having trouble seeing where the author is going with the story line.  We seem to have been getting detail after detail about this family living near Kabul, their interactions, their history, their feelings about one another.  I hope this is like a James Mitchner book where he spends two or three hundred pages writing the history of the world, then gets to the story.  I feel like I was kind of taken in by the title, but will keep reading in the hopes that I finally get into some sort of story line.
B00B9366VO|4.0|Some of the best music and recordings from the best era in music.  If you like real music, recorded on the best analog equipment, watch this one.  Yes, it was an expensive process, but they got some amazing results.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan provides compelling arguments for the Historical Jesus, and provides insights on how he probably viewed himself in the context of the political movements of 1st Century Palestine.<br />Also, the masterful storytelling in which he does so, makes this book an incredible read for those not familiar with scholarly works on the field.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|From Minority Report to War of the Worlds and now Oblivion, Tom Cruise has once again reinforced his acting prowess in the Sci-fi genre. The direction, production, and cast make Oblivion a 4-star outing. Andrew Wyeth is my favorite painter, so when I saw Christina's World a few times toward the end, I just sat back and smiled. What a BONUS, and thank you to the Andrew Wyeth Estate!!!
159413586X|5.0|The trilogy was excellent, it kept me riveted!  I could not put the book down.  I was sorry it ended.
B00BAYLRNO|4.0|really interested in what these rouge waves can do.  The damages inflicted on the Mom made me gasp.  Loved that she still cared, esp. for the little 2 yr.old and that her son saw him reconciled with his Dad. Kindness for strangers stuck in same situation and family love displayed throughout movie, will watch again
0307472590|5.0|I liked totally, the way it was written, the characters, the story, the way Mr. Ruiz Zafron describe the town.
B009VMLSHC|4.0|never underestimate the power of lust or love, beautiful scenes, made me feel like I was there...too bad the doggy died that was the saddest part. loved the ending
B002HFWAWW|5.0|Christan Bale does a great job and is a insanely good actor in this movie he plays the part better than anyone could. I don't care how many people try to paint this guy as a crazy person or actor he does a great job as an actor and give it his all in every performance! I don't know what all the fuss is about a lot of actors are very particular about stuff in get into on set arguments it is the same at any job over achievers can be difficult people to work in they are all in. Anyways the story is great the acting is great and the movie is underrated and underviewed in a big way.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Loved this book!  One of my favorites this year.  Makes you want to hug your dog and show him you care
0152465030|5.0|Everyone needs this book in their library. I bought these for my Daughters Birthdays. They loved them. They were beautiful and reasonably priced.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a good book, i like the way it brought everyone together like 100 degrees of separation<br /><br />Supposed to write 11 more words so this is how I'm going to do it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is my newest addiction!! Love that I can play with my FB friends!! Great way to pass time :)
B009NG1Q96|5.0|A wonderful follow-up to The Selection. I couldn't put it down and am so torn between her two loves. Can't wait for the next one.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|If you like SciFi, Dr. Who and everything outrageous, then Torchwood is for you. Torchwood is Dr. Who on steroids.
1451683405|1.0|Sam Harris argues that we don't have free will. If he truly believed this, why make the argument?<br /><br />The introductory text to this book says: \\"it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.\\"<br /><br />Okay, but how exactly could this change come about?<br /><br />I happen to think I have free will. What mechanism in my mind would allow me to change my mind about this?<br /><br />I would have to accept Sam Harris' thinking over my own thinking, and how might I do that except by making a choice?<br /><br />So if Sam Harris truly believed that I don't have free will, he should not try to persuade me to do something his own theory says I cannot do.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is a really epic season for Dexter because so much goes on. ***SPOILERS*** He meet Hannah and Deb finally chooses a side to be on. It's great!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Fun and interesting read. Just completed the first exercise and it sure makes you aware as to where your thoughts go!  This book is an easy, humorous and thought provoking book.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|L Frank Baum wrote for the fans and you can tell it in these novels, but if I were you I'd break down and pay $0.99 for the whole collection on Kindle. It's a better format and easier to read.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|As an amateur birder I can relate to the thrill of birding. Jack Black, Sreve Martin, and Owen Wilson depicted with humor hard core birders. The movie was light hearted and fun!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Outstanding movie I loved the cg although I'm not in a lot of cg I also a big Tom Cruse fan that to is probably why
B004GYY714|5.0|My boyfriend downloaded this app on my S3 and I absolutely love it, so I decided to get it on my Kindle also. There is so much Variety to choose from, its just simple amazing
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great as usual a definite read. Vince greatest book. So sorry he is gone!  We have lost someone special! We miss you already Vince!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun to play, Its a good mix of challenging but not too easy. Maybe a bit too repetitive but still good. Could use some more interesting weapons maybe. y
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I have been into photography sine I was a teenager.  Now 41, I thought I knew more about photographic exposure than I actually did.  This book has given me tips that I was able to put into use right away.  My camera hasn't been off manual since I started reading this book!
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I really thought this movie was excellent for the first 3/4th's of the story. I really love the look to this updated Star Trek universe (just as in the 1st movie) and I like that all the main characters truly do maintain consistency with the original ones (only Kirk being a bit more free spirited and reckless). The opening \\"Bond like\\" sequence was interesting and beautifully portrayed on screen. The initial set up to the plot conflict was intelligent and well paced out with several action spots. Like some other reviewers have mentioned however, the ending slipped a bit because it became so typical of many action films. As a result, the ending came across as cliche', overblown and unrealistic (Spock is awesome, but I didn't think he possessed uber-strength that approaches Khan's!). The ending is what drops my rating one star. Nonetheless, I found this movie to be very entertaining on the whole and I do hope they make another in the series.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This is an officially licenced product and uses the actual Star Wars theme song and has a lot of sound bites by Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones and whoever voiced Yoda amongst other actors from the film. Also a lot of sound effects from the film. Star Wars Pinball comes with just the one table (Empire Strikes Back) not three as stated in the product description.  It is however a very good table, you play it on your Kindle Fire in portrait mode touching the left or right of your screen with your thumbs on the screen at the perfect height when you hold something with two hands. You can of course lie it down on a table or something and just tap the screen. Besides the two main flippers there's also a few others higher up on the screen that you flip by touching the screen higher up.  You launch the ball by flicking your finger on a lightsaber.<br /><br />It's a really nice looking artistic wise table that gives you feeling your in a Rebel aircraft hanger, the Death Star or something. The table has a picture of Vader, R2D2, C3PO, Han, Chewbacca, Luke, Leia and Yoda like you would have seen on a movie poster.  The image has a real Retro vibe to it, like merchandise you came across back then. Or like a pinball table would have looked Empire Strikes Back themed back in 79 before the film was released to promote it or early 80s after it had been released for kids to play in milk bars, pizza shop foyers and places like this cashing in on the popularity of the film.  Little challenges come up too as you play like I had a lightsaber and had to hit the beams fired by that floating miniature Death star looking thing like Luke did in his training.  You can choose to score points for either the dark side or light side (yeah it says this instead of Jedi or Rebels). As far as I can tell playing for both sides the table is exactly the same with either choice. When you get the ball to go in certain places little graphics of stormtroopers, Vader, an X Wing and other graphics pop up and move or fly around for a little while.<br /><br />The game has a tutorial called Table Guide that shows you the parts of the table you want to get the ball into or hit.  It also shows a cool fight scene you get to do against Vader, although I've never gotten to this in the game (but I haven't played it too many times yet).<br /><br />Highly recommend this for fans of Star Wars or pinball.  You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this once it's downloaded which is what you want in a game as it means you can play it anywhere, anytime.  If you are connected it wants to post your score on a challenge table somewhere if you're into that kind of thing.s pop up and move or fly around for a little while.<br /><br />The game has a tutorial called Table Guide that shows you the parts of the table you want to get the ball into or hit.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This was one of those books you don't want to put down.  I found myself trying to imagine what the Capital was going to do next. This is a \\"must read!\\"
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Sure there are others that claim to do the same thing but I have tried most.  Many other readers are finacky and will not read some of my NEW SD cards.  This Apple reader is a replacement for a previously lost Apple reader.  This one never failed to read a card.  I use this primarily for my trail cameras for hunting and viewing the pictures taken with them.
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|I liked this app, it runs well on the Kindle fire. Positioning the cue stick takes a bit of getting used to but after a while you get the hang of it. Good time waster.
B00371XIJE|5.0|If we humans learnt the loyalty displayed by this one dog, the whole world would be a much better place to live in.  I'm not sure I like how TPTB decided to anthropomorphize the dog by showing certain scenes from Hachi's POV (B&W v. color) but it did serve it's artistic purpose of tugging at the heartstrings more.  If it didn't make me bawl each time, I'd watch it over and over again.  Loved it!
B0067LY4WG|4.0|If you like Leonard Cohen, especially his later offerings, then this album will be well received.  Mostly excellent tracks in the style adopted in recent years with great backing both instrumentally and vocally.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|always keeps me guessing, and I am usually wrong.  I love the unpredictability of the script writing.  The dialogue is deliciously biting at times and appropriately tender at others.  Looking forward to Season 4
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the best book I have  read in a long time!!! I loved the characters and the story.  I absolutely recommend it, you won't be regret it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The only thing I did not like is the sentence: &#34;...an Earthworm's Eye View. Are we going to feel like worms on the other side?
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I gave this to my 77 yo Father last Father's day because my husband and I watched this series and loved it.  He and my mom loved it to.  This is TV at its best.  You will enjoy the characters.  Even though the main characters are mostly Democrats, I as a Republican didn't get upset about it.  And I'm pretty passionate about issues.  It was a good series that didn't focus on trading sleeping partners or shooting people or medical blood and guts.
B00009QNY5|1.0|It did not work in any dvd player, I don't know what is wrong with it! How can I return it?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I could not wait until I could see the next episode.  I loved every bit of it.  The period costumes, the furnishings and the distinction of social classes were so interesting. The exploration of the period before, during and after World War I and it's impact on British society was very enlightening.  I l loved the way they shed light on the effect of war on the soldiers suffering from post traumatic stress and the wives who lost their husbands due to war.  Great series, I tell all my friends to watch it. Can't wait until season 4.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was skeptical of the whole &#34;lose 20 lbs in 30 days&#34;, I still am, honestly. However, I am on Day 23 currently and have lost 4 lbs and an inch and a half off of my waist. All of my measurements have went down and when I started, I couldn't do a push-up and now I can! I highly recommend this dvd.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Can't wait for the third book, very catching. The main character is described incredible good and the whole descrptions are very vivid
B009ZQFSRA|5.0|I love this movie!  The story is great and intriguing and it is well acted.  It's essentially the matrix meets 1984.  The story is fun and not overly-gruesome.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So well written, so well directed, so well edited. It evokes another time. Love the scenery and how the mood is set each episode.
0316228583|2.0|Every time I start to read this book, I fall asleep. I was excited to buy it after seeing the reviews, but it is a slow moving book about sleepy towns. I have to keep going back just to remember when the characters were introduce and who they are related to. With the Harry Potter series, I couldn't put the books down and usually finish each book in a day or two. Bought The Casual Vacancy a month ago and I am not even half way. I will finish it though seeing that I spent good money on it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I did not like the new version at first,  but I quickly figured out that it does everything the old app did but better.  When I travel by car I like to insert Cities along my route and view the up coming weather that is just ahead.  I like the simple temperature display and one touch if I want more details.  Change is hard but change never stops so you must learn to deal with it or life will pass you by.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was my first time reading a book written by Christina McKenna I truly enjoyed every bit of it and look forward to reading more of her books.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app I would totally recommend this. If will give your weather for a month at a time. If you like to look at weather this is for you and everyone.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I can imagine this one popping into Mr King's head as he travelled down the highway.  Thank you for a very enjoyable story!
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This is the best album I've heard since Worship Music from Anthrax!  Great songs and fantastic execution!<br /><br />Obviously amazing talent from the three of them but, as others have said, super groups don't always write good songs.  There are some really great songs on this album.  I don't think there is a bad one on it but I especially like Elevate, We Are One and Six Feet Deeper.  Most songs have an awesome bridge about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through where all three of them show off.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This game is awesome I don't know why they don't like it, it's fun,and its cool!!<br />So what! if they want some money everyone wants money even the people who put bad reviews want money every app in the world has adds so what?!?! I say,<br />It's fun and you should get it!!!!
B000002KAT|5.0|With just a few weeks before the release date of the HD (Bluray-Audio) version of Moondance in the Deluxe Remaster Edition i really wonder when the bigger and to my ears better and more mature brother will see the light of day ? A wish for a SACD edition or a Pure-Audio Bluray edition from a 192kHz/24bit new digital master is on top of my list for a long time, it would be a day of celebration and neverending musical bliss. Please Warner Music staff read and hear this and decide to bring joy to the masses.... : ) Thank you in advance.
B006PTZNSY|5.0|and I love this CD I expected it to be horrible condition  with what I paid for it but it was PERFECT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|What can I say, this CD is the ultimate classic.  If you already own it, you know what I mean.  If you don't, then I highly suggest you add it to your collection of music.
B00EXVZZE8|5.0|As a game cridict,I have played many games and this is a very great one and it is so addicting that even I was inpresses.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|All I can say is that 1) Black Sabbath's music got me through some pretty dark years during the early 70's intact, because they reflected a lot of my same dark conclusions, as well as hope, about the world. 2) this is the first CD in a long time that, after hearing half of the first track, I jumped to purchase.  3) It's ALL there.  and 4) I hope that Black Sabbath's understanding of how we all question the Universe deep in our gut will save another generation of confused children, brought up in a cognitively dissonant world.  This is where I go to make sense of the insanity, not to go insane...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like this app a lot. It give me all the info I need to know about the status of battery,not just the charge percentage. I recommend it to all users.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|The cast and plot are intelligent and keep your attention. It is action packed and unpredictable. i recommend it to all
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. It helps me wind down before going to sleep or just to relax after a long day :-)
B00BSWMITK|5.0|One of the finest musicians of any genre does not disappoint. The ultimate creative guitarist, this CD will please any Satch fan. Just saw him live last night and his current band is INCREDIBLE.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game. No issues with this game at all!!!! Love the details , love everything about it. Fun for everyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so addicted to this show. It really is amazing and I cannot wait for the next season! I would give it a million stars if I could!
B00D5YNQMW|3.0|The sound and quality are excellent; the band pours their hearts out in concert- that is, what we see of the concert.  Steven, Joe, Brad, Tom and Joey perform with gusto and fever; however any hardcore Aerofan will be somewhat disappointed by the flow of the video and especially the ending.  Why ruin one of the greatest songs recorded by this group as the ending credits, and cut off the song, just playing a tease of the beginning minute? Train Kept A Rollin is usually an encore, we look forward to it as a sexy treat at the end of Aerosmiths concerts (just as we do to Dream On).  Only showing a minute of footage is a disgrace for fans and a waste.  This wasn't the only low point of the film.  I do sympathize with the people that suffered such devastation but they didnt need to be playing guitar.  Let's leave that to the Bad Boys of Boston.<br />The setlist was great, but as a true fan who has seen over 40 Aerosmith concerts, I was a bit disappointed.  Don't leave me hangin!  I own Texas Jam, The NYC Robinhood Benefit Concert, Aerosmith Unplugged and a shelf of other proshot Aero dvds, and I prefer all of them to this one.  Add it to your collection for the sake of having it, but you may feel shortchanged.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a great love story! A perfect twist on the typical forbidden love.  The characters are easy to love and this quick read will definitely leave you wanting more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Kept me wanting more and a great twist in this story. The shocking cliffhanger at the end made it impossible not to buy the third book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Perfect ending to a perfect love story.  Some sex scenes were a little too explicit for me but the real story is the love between them.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its good and i liked it. good pictures. different rooms to seach and unlock.i enjoy playing this game. its fun and exciting
