B00DW1WR14|4.0|Pearl Jam's discovery that just being a great rock and roll band has its merits again has been a joy to hear. They continue this hot streak started with \\"Backspacer\\" with \\"Lightning Bolt,\\" a mixture of pulse pounding rock and even some punk fury, along with some deeply touching songs that expose just what an affecting singer Eddie Vedder can be.<br /><br />\\"Getaway\\" sets the tone from the beginning, decrying that everyone searching for a better place, but you have to come through \\"the dark stormy weather.\\" Still, Vedder is happy to claim that \\"what's mine is mine.\\" This is just before launching into the furious guitar attack of (first single) \\"Mind Your Manners,\\" a barely three minute detonation. Even with that level of brevity, Mike McCready unleashes a spike of a guitar solo. If you were watching the videos for the Wrigley Field debut of \\"Lightning Bolt\\" (complete with Mother Nature adding visual effects), you already know that the mystery woman gives the band something to tear through as it builds to its crescendo.<br /><br />The moments of balance come with the softer \\"Sirens\\" and \\"Sleeping by Myself\\" (which first appeared on Vedder's solo \\"Ukelele Songs\\"), where nuance rules the day. They've come to understand that softness doesn't always have to come with caustic. That's really driven home on \\"Lightning Bolt's\\" closer, the positively lush with emotion \\"Future Days.\\" The sound of grown men taking on a world that perhaps \\"Jeremy\\" would have grown up to love, it's a gorgeous song, rating with the band's absolute bests.<br /><br />Lest anyone get the idea that Pearl Jam might be forgetting their purpose in life, they haven't. The rock is still fierce, Vedder can still emote like few singers of his era, and McCready retains his status as the band's utility weapon of choice. They haven't forgotten their love for music, once again dipping to the spinning of the black circle for the guitar boogie of \\"Let The Records Play.\\" But now that's tempered by a man who can say (on \\"Future Days\\") \\"I believe, I believe because I can see, our future days...days of you and me.\\" \\"Lightning Bolt\\" may contain plenty of thunder, but Pearl Jam can now also see the calm after the storm.<br /><br />PS. The Album packaging is sumptuous enough to give an old geezer like me nostalgia trips to when the album sleeve was part of the fun of buying new music. There are some things a download just can't replace.(on \\"Future Days\\") \\"I believe, I believe because I can see, our future days...days of you and me.\\" \\"Lightning Bolt\\" may contain plenty of thunder, but Pearl Jam can now also see the calm after the storm.<br /><br />PS.

B00ESY7QXI|1.0|We had a baby a few weeks ago and hadn't really sat down and watched a movie for several months. We decided to stay up late one night and watch Gatsby because it looked good when it was at the movies.  Well, we were disappointed.  Some camera angles are cool, but the whole underlying story is dark and laced with racy characters, affairs, and seedy drama.  Plus the ending leaves you asking: &#34;Why did I just watch that? I feel like I need to take a shower.&#34;  This just wasn't for us.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Awesome movie. probably movie of the year alongside Star Trek into darkness. fun and intense. Brad Pitt did an amazing job!
B001F0N0ZG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! Truly a love story at its best. Your emotions will go from laughing to crying before Carrie gets carried away. A must see!
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|I read this book in two sittings - the fast-paced, punchy style is very effective. Jimmy is an involving central character. His intentions are good but gripped by cocaine and encouraging friends, it was always going to be a roller coaster ride. Things get deadlier when he starts a new life in Costa del Sol and meets the scheming manipulative Jason. There are a number of twists and turns, especially the ending, which wrapped the story up beautifully. I recommend Get Clean to readers who like hard-hitting action.

B00BEIYMAG|4.0|The Conjuring is a hard film to place: on the one hand you love it for its fresh take on a dried out genre, but on the other the same cliches that it denounces in the first half are welcomed in and made house guests for the second half. It  keeps one foot one step behind and the other forward into uncharted territory. However, one thing is clear: from the haunting violins that permeate its atmosphere to its incredible cinematography, you will be enthralled from beginning to end with its fantastic execution.<br /><br />The cinematography is pitch perfect. James Wan isn't afraid to use a camera for what it is, a medium for artistic expression. Everything is shot beautifully and the angles are just right, so that they keep things suspenseful and frightening. The soundtrack is phenomenal.  Whether it's a song from the 70s or a screeching violin it creates an atmosphere that is rarely seen in modern cinema.<br /><br />Vera Formiga and Patrick Wilson steal the show as a ghostbusting couple named Ed and Lorraine Warren (based on the real life Warrens), who must help a family to remove a demonic presence that has taken occupance in their new home. The Warrens carry enough vigor and zeal that you hardly think them crazy for keeping a basement filled with demonic artifacts. They are the good guys in every sense and you'll be rooting for them from beginning to end. The Perrons are a brady bunch-esque family with, gasp, likable personalities. And this is really the strength of the film, the connection between the viewer and the family as they get through their nightmare.<br /><br />The acting is spectacular, save a few characters (I'm looking at you Deputy Dan). Among the children actors Joey King<br />steals the show with very believable emotion. You don't have to be a clairvoyant to see that she has a promising future.<br /><br />The film dipped into comical more times than comfortable.Near the final act it leaves its subtle roots that made it so good, and goes for the modern, in-your-face scares that we've all grown tired of It's more of a lasagna, there's cheese in every bite, but the meat and pasta are still there, and satisfying.<br /><br />With all this said the movie would be a mere 3-stars. So why am I giving it four? Because the first half of the movie was one of the greatest I've ever seen in the genre.It is truly scary and completely magnetizing. The apex of the film's greatness, unfortunately, is around the basement scene, which, if you've seen the trailer, you've already seen.From there on out the film slowly begins to decline until it ends on a disappointing note.<br /><br />Perhaps the Conjuring misses getting to the lofty heights of horror giants such as the Exorcist and Alien, but<br />for how far it has climbed it is an achievement, and for that worth multiple viewings with friends and unsuspecting relatives.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have never studied Jesus or the milieu in which he lived. So, for all I know, everything here could be inaccurate. Or just plain false. But I can comment on the writing (outstanding). Reza is the RZA of storytelling. He grips you like a murder-mystery writer.<br /><br />I didn't notice any logical fallacies, and the arguments seemed persuasive.  Also, he presents a creative theory regarding Paul's role that I've never heard at church or from my more religious friends.<br /><br />If you're a novice, like me, or just interested in a gripping story, or great writing, you should read this short book.

B000HX499S|4.0|The GENERAL lesson of the fictional story (that a young woman who is a &#34;butterfly,&#34; needs to stop being a &#34;butterfly&#34; and instead settle down into a true constructive loving relationship with a proper man) is extremely excellent.  The scene near the end of the play, where [after the man (who was fed up with the destructive attitude of his &#34;butterfly&#34; girlfriend) angrily leaves] the woman puts on the little ring and bursts into tears -- BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT HE WAS 1000% RIGHT -- IS CERTAINLY TOTALLY AWESOME!!<br /><br />(And that so very emotional scene was superbly played by the AAA1 main actress of the play, Audrey Hepburn.)<br /><br />There are a number of problems though, with the movie:<br /><br />1.) There is an explicit scene of the woman and the man in the man's bed, in which the man is shown with his naked chest.  This is all totally unnecessary and drags the picture down into the realm of smut; that it touches onto the line of  &#34;male pornography&#34; is, of course, severely, severely sick!!!!<br /><br />2.) In the fictional story, soon after the young man and the young woman begin their relationship, the man is confronted by the woman's husband!  In turn, the man confronts the woman; she assures him though, that the marriage with that husband had been annulled.<br /><br />The man also had some kind of a relationship with another woman, which he eventually breaks off.  The play is not clear at all exactly what kind of relationship it was; the man simply called her his &#34;interior decorator,&#34; but it is obvious that it was more than just a business venture.<br /><br />This is a major problem with countless soap opera stories: That in the story of a man and a woman who are developing a relationship, the man, or the woman, or both of them, are also in some kind of a relationship with someone else or in a question of a relationship with someone else, which thus puts the &#34;main&#34; relationship of the story into the realm ofeither being illicit or a question of being illicit.<br /><br />Story writers cannot seem to make a &#34;straight&#34; story of a single man (with no attachments!) and a single woman (with no attachments!) who are developing a proper legitimate relationship!<br /><br />3.) In the fictional story, when the man and the woman are out having an enjoyable day together, the woman tells the man how she used to have &#34;fun&#34; by stealing from dime stores and not getting caught.  She thus &#34;dares&#34; the man to do that with her now; they thus both go into a nearby store, and manage to slip out unnoticed with two stolen masks.<br /><br />Now, in the context of the story, the woman's perverse enjoyment of this stealing is clearly part of her &#34;butterfly&#34; nature.  At the same time though, stealing, even just a &#34;tiny bit&#34; from a dime store, is, of course, a very terrible crime.  So it was wrong for the play to present this incident -- of them BOTH doing it -- as if it was just some &#34;harmless&#34; &#34;fun.&#34;<br /><br />Instead, the made up story should have ideally been that the man refuses to do the shop-lifting (and he dissuades the woman by suggesting to do a different -- legitimate -- fun activity).  If that scenario would not fit in with the character of the woman, then the story should have been that, after the incident, when he is not with her, the man brings the two masks back to the store.  He apologizes to the store owner and either returns the masks or pays for them.
B008JFUQZ2|1.0|The movie is mind-bogglingly bad.<br /><br />I don't accept the litany of apologia for its cliche-ridden plot lines, cardboard characters, and outright theft from myriad anime and manga series that have been formulated by others who insist that \\"del Toro meant to do that\\", or that \\"critics of the film just don't understand\\".  No.  It's bad.  It's not just bad, its horribly, predictably, stereotypically bad. What's most amazing is that del Toro managed to make a bloated, big budget film with massive explosions and mahem at every turn that is not only boring, but is also without a single original idea anywhere in it. (I know, I know: he 'meant' to do that.  Sure.)<br /><br />My fervent hope: that del Toro never, ever, EVER gets to make his version of Lovecraft's \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\": he's not worthy to do so. Should there ever be any doubt about that, simply steel yourself (perhaps with a shot or two of Jaegermeister...pun intended) and sit through another viewing of \\"Pacific Rim\\".<br /><br />If. You. Can.<br /><br />And did I mention that it's really bad?
0060899220|5.0|I had borrowed this book from my local library several years ago and when I saw it for sale so cheap I couldn't resist. This book is a must read for anyone in the restaurant industry.

Thanks Tony for showing us (the back of the house) that its not that easy.
0143034901|5.0|After years of badgering by my brother-in-law to read Carlos Ruiz Zafon's THE SHADOW OF THE WIND I finally got a copy and spent a very pleasant couple of months (I'm a very slow reader) with the characters in this book and I'm so glad I did. It's a beautifully-written and visual portrait of Barcelona, Spain in the mid mid 20th Century, and the coming of age of the main character Daniel amid a world of books and heart-breaking love - sometimes his own, sometimes those of a man whose life he becomes obsessed, Julian Carax, author of a lost and forgotten book which Daniel comes into possession and which a mysterious character is obsessed with obtaining at all costs. Some blurbs for the book called SHADOW OF THE WIND a Gothic story, and to a point maybe it is - where the dark, sometimes ominous (sometimes beautiful) settings have as much impact on the story as the characters themselves, but unlike most Gothic stories I've read (or been forced to in school), this one moves along as a good clip from the very beginning and is filled with three-dimension and dascinating people, dialogue and a narrative that never lingers too long in description. Lucia Graves' translation of Zafon's original Spanish is clear and wonderful, never stumbly (if that's a word).<br /><br />Now, and this is probably common in this type of tale, the story is from one character's perspective, but we learn deeper and deeper back stories from the characters he meets. The amount of detail they relay to him through the course of the book is of course far too much for it to be realistic, the author uses their borrowed perspectives to continue in his rich and infinitely-readable prose to tell the stories of so many people (and he does a great job reminding you who is who throughout which is a gift not every writer has but Zafon does), so this is easily forgiven.<br /><br />For the language alone and the author's obvious love of books and lost stories waiting to be found I highly recommend this wonderful novel.vel.

B00EUS9JF0|2.0|Okay - I've listened to this a couple of times. Paul's voice is pretty creaky. I don't have a problem with a dude's voice getting ragged. You can change your material to accommodate your voice - writers do it all the time. On this record, Scared (a hidden track after Road)is the best example of material that can benefit from Paul's older voice. Unfortunately its the last and only song to exploit what remains, rather than papering over it. Frankly, it's shocking how many tunes on this record use Paul's falsetto - which is perhaps even more tired than his actual voice. It's an example perhaps of McCartney's hubris, or his various producers cowardice not to have cut this misstep off at the pass. Instead, it's so overused I found myself wondering why this CD wasn't titles Falsetto instead of New.<br /><br />The quality of the songs on this record are a mixed bag. Early Days is excellent top to bottom.  But when things like Appreciate make it onto a record as something other than a bonus track, it's clear the offering is padded. Indeed, many of the songs are textbook throw away McCartney, where slap dash lyrics abound. One of the most disappointing aspects of New is what's missing: the piano ballad. Paul can generally craft great piano ballads - there's usually one per record, but only Scared approaches the style. It's really too bad, because this is probably where Paul's talent as a singer is most intact - but maybe he wants to avoid that image and it's implications of age.<br /><br />Finally, the production on New is just not happening. The guitar riff on Save Us is probably one of the best licks on the record, and it sounds like it was plugged straight into the mixing board then distorted - ala Black Dog - but a thousand times more so. It doesn't even sound like a guitar anymore. Now, when someone you are working with makes a decision to guild the lily on your best stuff, what can they be trusted with at all? This record is so overproduced - but not in the standard McCartney fashion - instead, it adds layers of reverb-drenched modern sounds that force themselves into the songs, ultimately making a lesser effort contrived as well.Cartney fashion - instead, it adds layers of reverb-drenched modern sounds that force themselves into the songs, ultimately making a lesser effort contrived as well.
B00FF5SXB8|5.0|Everything is in place for an amazing action/fantasy series:  Joss Whedon co-creator/co-exec. producer, David Boyd (also from Firefly) cinematography, Bear McCreary (The Walking Dead) composer, ABC/Marvel/Disney providing the backing of what is obviously a budget unrivalled by the majority of prime-time television, a very attractive cast with special emphasis on gorgeous Chloe Bennet (Sky) and the wonderful chemistry between the scientists Fitz & Simmons, a cameo by Samuel L. Jackson on the second episode portending great things to come...<br /><br />It's immediately apparent that this S.H.I.E.L.D. team (although including two adept fighters) relies more on their wits and strategy than super-powers which causes the episodes to resemble the classic \\"Mission Impossible\\" series more than \\"The Avengers\\" film.  Also, I suspect that Marvel picked up on the fact that many of us fans became attached to Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) from his first appearance in \\"Iron Man\\" and when we saw him go down in Avengers we honestly felt the loss; however creating a weekly television series with him as the main star seemed a little risky but oh my gosh, was I ever pleasantly surprised.  Beneath his polished exterior of stoic professionalism resides a heart of legitimate compassion, as demonstrated in the very first episode, combined with fierce determination despite his apparent lack of outstanding physical prowess (unless you consider cool-headedness in the face of just about any threat a super-power) but somehow this character and the actor playing him were and remain the primary hook for me.<br /><br />Honestly, this show looks more like something made by Spielberg which just adds to its overall larger than life feel and frankly I'm amazed and thrilled at the renaissance of creativity and pageantry television is beginning to see after a very long Dark Age of reality TV.  :o)
1883217040|5.0|I picked this up after a long hiatus from playing jazz. This book did for me in the first two chapters what years of lessons and playing never accoplished: a logical explanation of the relationship between chords and scales. This book quickly demystifies jazz and exposes the logical workings behind the music. I credit this book for re-igniting my desire to play. If you only buy one Jazz Theory book it needs to be this one!

B0051BVQFG|5.0|Movies are often a personal and emotional thing for me.  But because of that when I watch a movie with others or in a theater I will often try to keep those things in check and it can interfere with the experience.  When I first watched this in the theater with friends I found I was more concerned about getting personally involved and it did interfere with the experience.  I was taken \\"outside\\" and started to watch the movie from a more detached and critical perspective.  After that I considered it a 3 or 4 star movie and my main criticism is that it was formulaic, typical Hollywood fare.<br /><br />Fast forward to the other night and BLA was on TV and I watched it again late night and by myself.  I loved it!  Despite that it was formulaic it drew me in and I felt it, got me right in the gut.  For me it was a three or four star movie when watched with others but when I watched it by myself it was a five star movie.  I think I will stick to comedies when I watch a movie with somebody else.  Highly recommended if you watch it by yourself.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|A young orphan girl is sent to live with good hearted but course strangers far from her original home. This is a third party telling of her experiences with building family, connections and survival during Occupied Germany.<br /><br />There were parts in which I found the writing a bit annoying and pretentious (however the POV is from a rather unexpected source, so that might be why) but despite that the character's are solid, their personalities well developed and identifiable, even very realistic. This book took a horrifying background (Occupied Germany) and built in a moment of beauty and retrospect that felt like an almost long lost memoir. It made me laugh and cry, many time at the same time. It takes a special sort of writer to be able to work a tapestry of brilliant nonchalant vulgarity and poignant grace.
0525952926|5.0|Finally received the second installment of this trilogy.  I really enjoy this author's work and was not disappointed by this book.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|If you have multiple power adaptor from old macs this is a great companion for you New Mac 2013... I Love it... No more worries on bringing my old power adapters.
B003ZJ70W4|3.0|As sequels go, it was okay. It was fun to watch and if you are a fan, I'm sure you would like it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game except that it is highly addictive:-) I play this during my lunch hour every day! It is one of the best hours of my day.
B004I9CXHW|4.0|Works like a charm although I was expecting a beefier cable like the one that came with the vehicle. .
B00DW1WR14|4.0|Alright, admittedly not a great title...but this is not your typical PJ..or is it?<br />The first 3 songs rock in familiar places and give the seasoned Pearl Jam a taste of familiar medicie (cue Spin the Black Circlish bombast).. specifc nod to the fantastic opener..Getaway..rocking a steady, confident Vedder.  Great vocals throughout, but this is opener you NEED after a 4 yr haitas.  Mind your Manners - grabs and holds tight (great sequel to Spin the Black..if untended..right at home on a Vitalogy  - superb harmonies in bridge, and solid instrumenation throughout.  Perfect compliment..My Father's son.. Eddie can tell a story.<br />Next, my fav.. Sirens..love the emotive chorus, and the intimate feel in this.. Eddie NAILS the vocals, both heartfelt and haunting, harmonies galorie, and love the build. (feels at home on a Yield\\"ish\\" - yet strikingly original at once, the best from PJam in years IMHO.<br />LBolt - slow build, repetive chorus, but good for the feel of the cd. Infallible and Pendulum strike an unfamilar groove, yet much needed to add depth the an outstanding library of music composition.. love the emotions this evokes..unlike anything before and Eddie's vocals soar in anuassuming passion (I feel a \\"nothing as it seems\\" vibe..) - there is presence here that sets it apart and makes it an album standout.. Swalowed - decent, exceptable rocker.. LTRPlay.. not sure how this works - not really my scene.. The last 3 will grow on me, but for now I leave you with<br />my impression..first time listening.  I just gotta say, Man, I miss the days of TEN!!<br />Evenflow, Alive, Jermey, Why go on?  Come on Eddie, lets channel THAT next time!<br />Talented band for sure - bootlegs tell the real story, and my Sirrus in locked to the Pearl Jam station... just give us what we ReALLy want!
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Sensor seems to do a great job from what I can tell and gives consistent readings.  Using this on a projected image I was actually pretty surprised how well it could read colors at even very low luminances.  To be fair I did not use any of the supplied software or drivers, my PCs already had the driver to run it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It is almost perfect. The recommended section is not what I would ever read though. It gives me guidelines for &#34;how to get candy crush&#34; wth
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|There are quite a few reviews out here, so I'll make this short. First off, I am a huge Beatles fan. That also includes being a fan of their solo work but Paul was always my favorite. With that being said, I think this album will not disappoint his fans. I've been listening to this cd all day and I can say that I am really enjoying this one. Out of all of the songs, my least favorite song is the single \\"New\\". I have a few favorites, but it sounds fresh but at the same time, it sounds very Paul from times past. I am also glad I purchased the two bonus songs as well and I absolutely love the hidden track - Scared.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wanted this on vinyl, but didn't want to wait until November to hear this, so I purchased the mp3 deluxe edition from Amazon and had no issues with the transaction.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story keeps you reading until the end and not stopping !  Every emotion is played out in the lives of these two women. It makes all the trials of life seem worthwhile and gives meaning to it all.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|In this case the UltraViolet code just makes the movie available via Flixster, rather than ITunes. Which for me makes the UltraViolet code pretty worthless...
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|it is time comsuming but fun to search and achieve new pictures. collections can be difficult to gather but there seems to be a lot to master.
1401923127|2.0|I found Bruce Lipton's writing style dry, but cell biology & quantum physics are not exactly \\"light\\" subjects.  His story meandered all over the place, part autobiography, part technical tales.<br /><br />It all boils down to changing our bodies by changing our thinking....I totally believe in being aware how our attitudes affect our realities, & like attracts like, but this book.......zzzzzzzzz.
0375869026|5.0|This is not just a book for adolescents...it's for all ages....well written and fast paced .. opens the mind to how we 'see' people
1455523003|5.0|The late Christopher Hitchens wrote with such irreverence, & in this book has ripped the mask of piety off Mom Teresa.  Over my lifetime she was habitually presented by the media as a near saint on earth, but her habit of accepting accolades, $, awards, etc. from dubious 3rd world figures makes one stop & reflect.<br /><br />Included are eye witness accounts from past workers at her many missionary homes about how things really were.  Not to be missed!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Action packed! Writer is able to provide backstory on characters without slowing down the action! If you liked the Magicians this is a nice suggestion!
0452295548|4.0|From a total layman's perspective, how the brain 'works' and how this particular kind of stroke progresses and destroys, is fascinating! Very well written.The only obvious hole in it is inclusion of at least a passing thanks to the Master Designer.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|We just finished the last show and we cannot wait for the next season. We do not have T V reception so we order and watch the seasons as they are released to DVD .
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I am Malala is an inspiring eye-opener book. A very interesting read. I could not put it down. Just thinking that she is only 16 and has already done so much is humbling. Malala is more than just a girl shot in the head by the Taliban. She has been an activist for girls education for years. She is a true Muslim and a free spirit. Her book is the perfect gift for a teenager. Thank you, Malala for inspiring us all.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is a beautiful book on many levels. I hated it to end. I was looking for Steven King and ran across magic.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|One of the most enjoyable movies ever made.  Fun for the whole family!  Bette Middler is at her best, and Kathy Najimy is a delight
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cabel is long enough and sturdy. It satisfied all my expectations. Ordering and shipping was trouble free and there were lots of emails to keep me posted on every aspect of the transaction. Thanks a bunch.
B007T99ENE|4.0|The best thing about Ian McEwan's spy novel, Sweet Tooth, is the ending. The last line (I won't give the game away!) changes the whole feel, perspective and shape of the book. This is clever as there are virtually no clues along the way, yet it doesn't feel contrived, nor do you feel tricked. Hats off to McEwan for a little bit of genius.<br /><br />Having said all that I don't think this is his best book. I haven't read everything by McEwan, not by a long stretch, but I've read enough to know that some of his books I love (Atonement, Chesil Beach) and some I don't (Enduring Love).<br /><br />In the first paragraph he tells us the entire story.<br /><br />My name is Serena Frome (rhymes with plume) and almost forty years ago I was sent on a secret mission for the British security service. I didn't return safely. Within eighteen months of joining I was sacked, having disgraced myself and ruined my lover, though he certainly had a hand in his own undoing.<br /><br />This is a risk; a risk that the reader will switch off, or lose interest altogether. Or, hopefully, have the counter effect that you really want to know how it all unfolds. This was how I viewed it, although I have to say that Sweet Tooth was similar to Waiting for Sunrise (a book by William Boyd that I read recently) in the sense that the first half was mediocre and only the second half thrilling. Both Boyd and McEwan are great, highly-skilled authors and in both cases it was worth persevering, but I don't think that makes for a great book. Only a good one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The first two books I could barely put down.  This one seemed to drag a little, but Collins created such a likable character in Katniss, that you are compelled to finish and find out her fate.  All in all a good series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very enjoyable to read. The story was captivating and kept you on your toes. Looking forward to reading other titles by this author.
0525953728|4.0|Very good book to get insight into our Navy Seals and what they do.....writer was explicit and better than the movie of course
B008JFUR10|5.0|Now if your not into Science fiction and can't get past giant alien monsters don't bother.  But if you can this movies attention to detail is commendable.  The first 15 minutes is all setup and background.  Most movies do far less.  The writers go to great lengths to try to explain just about everything that's is going on in this movie.  The special effects are great and the action is almost nonstop.
030746363X|5.0|Tim writes like he's talking to a friend. I read a lot of reviews saying that this book is too long and confusing.... well people... this is NOT a diet book, if you are looking for a boring and uninformative diet book stay away!! If you are looking for a book that explains to you how to hack your body and become something entirely different, stop looking! You've found Shangri-La! And much much MUCH more!!!! Just read the first chapter... you'll fall in love with it! Laugh like mad and change your life forever... THANKS TIM!!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Watching this movie in 3D was exciting and the visual effects were amazing.  Overall, this is an awesome film to watch.

B00F91SCXC|5.0|I'm a huge Brad Pitt fan and this movie was awesome! The movie started off quick and didn't have a long drawn out synopsis of what happened.  Great movie and a must watch for any Brad Pitt, Zombie, thriller, action, movie fan!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love, love this page. I can get all sorts of different ideas. If it's for cooking or crafting. Just love seeing all these neat ideas .
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Awesome. Natalie Portman is so much fun to watch. And the other guy has a sense of legend to his voice overall good movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its pretty good for people who can't afford mc for computer. I would recommend getting it for iphone/ipad etc, but if you buy it on the amazon appstore you'll have to wait for updates like 0.7.6 or 0.8.0
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just started playing a couple of weeks ago but so far I am enjoying the game very much. I am not a very patient person so I dislike waiting on energy but it is interesting and it holds my attention.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ever since our Wii broke, I use it all the time (everyday), for streaming Netflix and youtube...<br />I would recommend this product and Amazon...
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Great book to get over yourself and get going in your mission. Well articulated vision of what holds us back. The fear, the self, the resistance.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It tells me lots of definitions and it tells me lots of new words that I didn't know before. Awesome dictionary, when I need it  it's right there for me.
1250038820|5.0|Reality is a funny thing. It often times gets covered by the \\"sound bite\\" culture that never stops long enough to peer into the eyes of us humans, smile and ask a question. Brandon has uncovered it for us with his clear lens of reality in New York City. Oh what beauty it shows us. Thank you Brandon for sharing your views from the street. I love this book!
0060512806|5.0|absoulutely loved this book.. i am definitely going to be reading it again.. it had a wonderful  historical feel giving much unknown information about wwII and the beginnings of computer technology
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If someone is looking for a book with a happy ending this isn't the book to read. I enjoyed all three of the hunger games books. It's a tie between the second and third as favorites.
0345803485|3.0|I wanted to know why women like this book soooo much.....and I .understood.....the writer is an american woman......and &#34;power&#34; is sexy !! in america....LOL

B00BPDR3F6|2.0|I am a voracious reader - I will read anything, anywhere. I am never bored in Dr offices reading four year old magazines. I read soup can labels and cereal boxes ---any one of which is a better read than this.
B004VQRCF0|5.0|If u love yes, u will love this cd. I am not able to get my husband to bed at nite because he watches over and over! He is listening to songs he has not heard in YEARS!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book does not disappoint. The story is true to the feel of the Shining.  I just can't get enough Stephen King!
B0000UJFCO|5.0|To be fair, my husband is a YES fanatic and has loved every DVD I have ordered for him! Kudos for me
B003B02O7I|5.0|I enjoyed this tale and the way Grisham brings the reader into the jungle setting.  The characters are all very believable.  I highly recommend this book.

B00CM4VC7M|5.0|A great representation of Sailor Moon! I can't wait to get the rest of the scouts. My favorite aspect is the removable faces to show her expressions. The Luna figure is adorable, too!
B004TACMZ8|3.0|After a minor use with this product it got malfunction.on/off button doesn't work,light button shut off the instrument.The battery gets drain to zero capacity if it is left in the scanner.The instrument got out of control without any reasonable explanation.not what i expected from a bosch product!<br />I wrote an email to\\" bosch Germany\\" concerning this product,they instruct the representative in my country to replace the scanner to a new and \\"good\\" one.Thanks to \\"Ledico\\".<br /><br />The scanner does its job ,but you can't rely only on it,you must have some knewledge about the wall you scan or the plans of Installation.<br /><br />Tamir.s
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|I played the free trial and enjoyed it, so paid $2.99 for the full version. No crashing or freezing issues. My 7 year old likes it too, as she has been learning about many of the artists paintings that are in the game.
1416511946|5.0|This book is the bees knees, it's one of those books that will never leave me. It's dark, it's insightful and the best part, it's really funny. This book makes you fall in love with Nikki Sixx even in all his depravity. You just want him to get better, it's shocking that someone in this famous band can be living such a low life and have such a lonely existence. His diary entries are refreshing and some of them are very fun to read especially seeing him deal with his love/hate relationship with Vanity. There was some talk of these entries being fake and even if they are I don't really care it's still entertaining to read and even if they were reworked the words definitely come across as genuine and real. If I could have I would read this book whilst eating, sleeping, driving, I just couldn't put it down and thought id be quite happy if it just went on forever. I was left happy for having read such a great book when it ended but sad that it was over and I don't think Nikki Sixx could ever write a book to that standard again because it's the raw decadent lifestyle that he no longer has, which is great for him, that was so compelling to read about in this book. It really took you to another place which wasn't pretty but made you glad you came. Definitely one to read again and again.
1250038820|5.0|I am a huge fan of HONY and am so happy to finally have the book. The images are stunning and the choice of captions and stories only adds to the beautiful imagery.
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|This is the best movie for this time of year - LOVE all of Tim Burtons stuff - just bought Sleepy Hollow last night. Delicious!
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|I enjoyed playing this game. But, I've paid less for games that lasted longer. Shame on you G5. Couldn't believe when the credits started rolling. It said to rate the game to get the sequel, hope it's free.
B000LGOPW2|5.0|I can't do slasher films, I get too scared, but I love a good scary movie as much as the next girl :-)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is alot of fun! a little hard, but not so hard you get frustrated by it. i'd definitely recommend it to my friends!
B00466HNHM|5.0|One of my most favorite movies always will be and to now have it in blueray great quality will always treasure this one
B001O1O71C|5.0|How poignant to see the world through two young boys.  I had no idea that the ending would strike me so surprisingly.  This is an extremely well written book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much the graphics are great the activities are fun and thia game is very interactive. This game is unlike those other games where the game is all glichy this game is clear and pure amazing. I recommend this game to anyone who likes or loves horses
B00DJXSKWU|2.0|I loved the game at first, but the appeal wore off very quickly. Once you hit level three you can't build your harvesters and mech factories quick enough to fend off the opposing forces. You barely have enough time to get a few mech puts together before you're OVERWHELMED by the other side. No fun. Tried all kinds of variations, no success. I paid for this game, so I feel a little cheated.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Ok  movie.  Ending was a downer! I wasnt  expecting it to be like the book, but I thought it would  follow the storyline a little bit better.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I'm going to self-publish with Amazon when my book is ready, so this book was a helpful read. A bit basic, but has all the information you need to your book Kindle-ready.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|pros:<br />better than default note 2 keyboard<br />customizable<br />flow<br /><br />cons:<br />have 2 version for phone and tablets<br />some time is not precise<br />some times don't make corrections<br />auto fill is bad
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Could NOT get this app to work, not matter how many times I set it up. Honestly, I just use my laptop and hook into my local station any way. Deleted this off my Kindle.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|The movie had great graphics and the storyline was drawing. The acting could use a little help. Jaden was great in his last few movies, but he wasn't feeling it in this one.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|This movie had a lot of action and a lot of twists and turns in the plot to keep you on your toes. I loved it extensively - and I would recommend it to anyone who isn't too nit-picky about special effects.<br /><br />(spoilers ahead)<br /><br />The special effects are awful. Terrible. Personally, this fact enhanced the movie. Because it was just so damn hysterical to see Taye Diggs' face laying on the floor like a cruddy photoshop job after Christian sliced it off with a sword. Seriously. I had to pause the movie because I was laughing so hard. And then I took a screenshot. It is now my new wallpaper.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|I have been a loyal Big Fish Games (&#34;BFG&#34;) customer for YEARS and own 100's of their games and have enjoyed my membership and most EVERY SINGLE of their games as well... until BIG FISH CASINO put up its marquee touting &#34;FREE GAME PLAY&#34;.  FREE!?  Uh, Casino is FAR FROM FREE and realize up front that you are PAYING REAL DOLLARS FOR VIRTUAL CHIPS IN RETURN and ultimately you will find:  NO FUN FACTOR AT ALL.  Just to emphasize my overall stance on this game (as a VERY experienced game player).... and in the event you do not read much further, I will tell you this: Before you even consider playing Casino, read EVERY NEGATIVE REVIEW HERE and online, multiply it by 10, add exclamation points, BELIEVE IT, and ACCEPT the fact that you, too, IF you try it, may, no-- WILL-- be vulnerable once you become 'addicted'  to players and gameplay (gameplay pull is basically in desiring to win your money BACK) and you just may end up losing not only money, but your humility as well.  Take this advice:  please, unless you have unlimited discretionary income and/or time... DO NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO PLAY THIS HORRIBLE GAME; do not even install it onto your computer or other device.  First and foremost, the 'odds' are SO skewed in Casino, it is almost laughable (looking back at least).  I ask you... how is it possible to LOSE slots betting ALL LINES at FULL DOLLAR (bet max) over 20-30 or more times and NEVER, EVER ONCE hit ANY WINNING COMBO WHATSOEVER  &#34;0&#34; &#34;0&#34; &#34;0&#34; &#34;0&#34;...!!??  Yet, that is exactly what has happened to me over and over.  There would be a small WIN STREAK thrown in to BOOST YOUR adrenaline and convince YOU  that the tide has FINALLY turned in YOUR favor and so you will CONTINUE playing and THEN IT HAPPENS... the LOSING STREAK and it will go on much longer than the LAST TIME and you will think, oh it was just a fluke... I will win (look at my past losing streaks, they, too ended... and oh, my other buddies... they are winning!?).HA!  Do not be fooled.  Within the whole 'scam' BFG has wittingly provided an entire indoctrination program for it's &#34;members&#34; you will be guided like a sheep to slaughter as you are prompted upon each return to play with, for example, the &#34;DAILY CHALLENGES&#34; (i.e.. make x# of friends today; give x# of gifts; play x# of a particular card game, etc. etc. etc.) and let's not forget the &#34;rewards&#34; for these challenges!!  Initially, the rewards appear to be quite generous and THEN once you are FULLY INDOCTRINATED, ie. perhaps a &#34;VIP&#34; those 1K chip rewards will appear very tiny indeed... that is because you are ESCALATING UP your purchasing due to increased LOSING my friend.  For this reason and many others, I state emphatically that CASINO is incredibly questionable in AT LEAST as far as ethics in &#34;payout&#34; stakes is concerned (and need I remind you, THEY ARE NOT REAL PAY OUTS AT ALL!); BFG must have the game programmed to ultimately remove your chance for ANY legitimate wins overall/long term (ie. so that you, as a player, can NOT accumulate chips, etc. and you WILL have to purchase and continue purchasing CHIPS and/or GOLD over and over again).  Yet as this is happening, you will be 'meeting' other players and all is peachy fun.  Another aspect for concern is when you realize not everyone is as 'wholesome' as they appear at first glance (tho most of my experiences were very good as relates to interactions with other players)... BFG Casino is a huge mixed bag as far as it's patronage and THERE IS, APPARENTLY, NO DRESS CODE, LOL.  With that and the fact you have an opp for 3 Avatars in your profile, know you will unwittingly 'happen' upon some very unsavory and outright. in-your-face Avatars.  When &#34;friending&#34; another player, as you are encouraged to do by BFG, you can 'scroll' through another persons 3 pictures (&#34;negative/neutral/positive)... two of which are not visible on your screen until scrolled.  Many times I was rather taken aback at what I saw on another's profile (one person had a picture of themselves with what appeared to be their child which was a nice wholesome image and then when I scrolled, the same female was pictured holding a huge artificial appendage.. I'm sure you catch my drift there).  As other reviewers have mentioned, there are players (female) who purposefully appear in their AVATAR profile/s in scantily clad poses and openingly ask for 'donations' for chips and gold.  What is this, online, virtual form of visual-vice trade for 'goods'?  There IS a 'report' button available, yet I never saw any  proof of moderators on or about the CASINO reprimanding anyone for anything as far as I could tell (I only say this due to seeing some of the same persons online multiple times so obviously they were not asked to remove their pictures and/or comments, etc).  So... know, I do not have addictive tendencies, yet the overall nature of the way the game is set up (irrespective of the aforementioned pictures, lol)  to &#34;REWARD&#34; the player for &#34;making friends&#34;, &#34;playing certain games&#34;, &#34;losing a certain # of games&#34;, I slowly and insiduously found myself becoming enmeshed in wanting to return to the game and make more friends, &#34;gift&#34; them, play rounds, etc. and, again,  more importantly, to make up for lost $!!)  So when I came to the realization that it was getting WAY to costly, I finally was disgusted once again that even my attempt to STOP playing CASINO was negative experience!  The reason I say this is because of the following:  Since, as mentioned, I own BFG's general games and in order to play them, I must open their GAMES MANAGER.  Well, a) for quite some time YOU COULD NOT DELETE CASINO from the Manager!  and b) Finally (probably due to massive levels of customer complaints) they made it possible for us to remove it and so I did just that, REMOVED IT, (so I thought!!).. Thinking I had removed Big Fish Casino from my desktop computer, I was shocked the following day, when I opened my Game Manager to play an unrelated game and low and behold... I received a POP UP ADVERTISEMENT from them for a sale on chips for the Casino!  Still taking my strong stance in opposing going back to playing (despite the draw), I went to &#34;X&#34; out of the ad when low and behold... EVERY SINGLE TIME I did so, Big Fish CASINO (the ACTUAL GAME APP ITSELF!!!!!!) POPPED UP AND BEGAN PLAYING ON IT'S OWN as well as 'flashing' a personalized popup box on top INDICATING I HAD CHIPS AND ENTICING ME TO PURCHASE MORE DURING THEIR SALE!!  This was very disturbing, especially in view of the fact that I had gone into the cache and thought I had removed all traces of &#34;Big Fish Casino&#34; from my system.  So, to bottom line it..... when all is said and done, I think it is very sad and unfortunate that a wholesome and well-loved company such as Big Fish Games has lowered it's belly so low to the ground that it has become a snake rather than a fish (or at least a SHARK versus the friendly, well-rounded mascot, fondly named &#34;Felix&#34; the fish) but more importantly, it is important to know the snare that may be set if you choose to try CASINO.  Big Fish Games is now offering many of these &#34;FREE TO PLAY&#34; games.... REALIZE , like CASINO, THEY ARE NOT FREE, PEOPLE!!!  Casino at the very minimal A COMPLETE AND UTTER RIP OFF in the long run and, IMO... if you are wise.. take my (and others' advice) and STAY AWAY.... FAR, FAR AWAY!!  Edited to add:  my review above was based on when this Casino Company was Big Fish Casinos (akaBig Fish Games) and was owned by the original BFG/BFC owner.  I do not have an opinion as to whether my review details may hold up now that BFG and BFC is owned by Churchill...    I will generalize a bit, however, and give some general and specific advice based OMHO and experience and that is, in short, that most games with in-app purchases are skewed to be money making and very lucrative means for developers and game distributors and I do not participate in any game requesting in-app purchases because basically by doing so I believe it is giving my approval or 'vote' with my dollars that I accept and admire and want more of those types of games offered now and in future... I don't and hope other readers will take issue with same.  I look back on the day one could purchase a game, install it, and play it for as long as one desired.... that, obviously remains the issue with 777 Casino and others in that you do not have control over how the outcome of your gameplay pans out and you are at the mercy of unregulated gameplay that may, very well, be geared to sucking up your discretionary income!  For instance, take a look at the &#34;packages&#34; 777 (or other in app purchase game) offers and ask yourself... would I be willing to pay $99.99 up front  for a PC or app game?  And be willing to shell out even more should I enjoy the game or persons participating therein?  If not, DO NOT INSTALL!  If you do, well, that is your choice but those on the fence realize too that in so doing you are voting with your dollars that these are the games you want now and in the future.  I don't know about you but I never paid that much for a PC game not even a MMORPG that I had unlimited access and unlimited game time.  It's a very lucrative trend for developers and very sorry trend for consumers IMHO.  My bottom line advice, therefor,  still remains to just simply stay away!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this program I hope the update helps to view the same info I see on my computer only problem I have had with it
B00D2JDNQ4|1.0|I was not surprised in the least by the myriad contrivances that dominate this book. Miss Catton has spent her life in creative writing classes of one sort or another and the result is this 800-plus page instrument of torture that is as pretentious as it is soulless. There is a marked absence of authenticty that charcterises genuine works of literature. Don't believe the hype: as John Keats said, if poetry (or talent) does not come as naturally as water, it had better not come at all. So watch this space: the future of books is grim indeed if its fate is to be dictated by those who believe they can acquire in a classroom what other, better authors have acquired via natural talent and from life.
0780622650|4.0|The movie is pretty good for Sci-Fi buffs and has some very interesting science fiction/real science intertwined into the movie.<br />My only complain would be the ending... it was very unfinished, it's open and leaves quite a bit to be desired.<br />Other than that, it's pretty good.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|Ok let me sum this all down; bunch of stupid people travel out into the middle of nowhere, read from books they shouldn't read from. Don't leave when they should, bunch of crazy crap starts happening, people die. Blah...blah...blah. How many times has this all been done?

B003D5FFY0|3.0|'every night\\" is  paul's best song  and it is missing . so, listen instead  to danny kirwan and his marvels instead. danny is never cloying, smarmy , or embarrassing . he sings more  wonderfully , writes more  fabulously and plays guitar more lovingly than anyone .
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My favorite game to play with my college age sons! We took it on vacation this summer and had a blast with it! I had to order the expansion pack because of the size of my family which makes the game a little pricey. But for the fun we have I think it is worth it!
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|The record is absolutely beautiful and it sounds even more gorgeous than the .mp3 track. Amazing album, amazing artist. Flawless vinyl.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved this book for its adventure, action, romance, and story. it's a quick read and easy to follow. would recommend it to those who liked the other books in the series!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If I could give this unit a zero I would. I downloaded Netflix and realized it will not do the basics. I couldn't pause. That is a fundamental function and no matter how many times and how many ways, it would not pause after the first 3 or so minutes of a movie.<br /><br />Further, once the movie started I couldn't get my iPod touch to convert to the movie. All it would do was run the movie on the iPod itself.<br /><br />It's a great idea with a terrible result. It's a POS.<br /><br />Karen
B00CWY76CC|3.0|not bad need harder rooms to come. but over all a fun and time passing idea. will keep a watchout for more to come as the year goes by.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is so easy to use, and so accurate. It was easy to download.  No one can complain about the price.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I am a real fan of this author, but I did not find this nearly as compelling as the two earlier books I read.  The others were among the best novels I've read, so I held up a high standard and found this okay, but not of the same quality.
039916409X|5.0|This book contains the information to guide you through the discovery of how you are creating your financial story. No matter what your financial circumstances are, these processes can show you how to uncover an clear the blocks that are keeping you from receiving more. For me, this work helps me see what limiting beliefs I have and then tells me how to clear them. Margaret is very generous and always gives you more than you expect. I have been learning from Margaret for several years and the work I have done with her has been nothing short of remarkable.
B002OMZTSK|4.0|This book was fairly good. It was a little predictable in places. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the thoughts of the author as the character which are strewn throughout the book. Although I do wish the author would've made the book a bit longer.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The writer kept my interest. I could feel the tension in the air in the war zone.  Brave men and women who serve.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow. This book was just excellent. I certainly recommend it, because WOW. It deserves all the praise it gets, that's for sure.
B009DQQF7Y|5.0|Best things out of Canada.............Hockey, Bands - Black Mountain, Indian Handcrafts and GODSPEED YOU! BLACK EMPEROR!  Their new album gets better after each spin. The complexity & subtlety of their music rewards the patient and attentive. &#34;Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!&#34; is spacey, layered, experimental & deep. Similar bands: Sleep, Ancestors, A Place to Bury Stranger, Pallbearer, Naam, Deerhunter....
B006GWO5NE|1.0|It doesn't work at all!! I have to hold it a certain way and I don't have time for that!! It sucks!! My kindle has been dead for weeks and I was excited for a new charger, but this one does not work!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game over all. can get a little predictable but a decent escape game. I would recommend it for passing the time.
B001NLL8LA|1.0|Great story with an excellent plot.  I enjoyed the  descriptions  of all of the characters. The  locations and direction were well described..On to the next book.
0385484518|5.0|This book will make you wonder about how you deal with everything in your life. I am very glad a friend suggested that I read it and you should too!
1612680011|5.0|This book brings new understanding for rich and poor and how we can change or lives if we so choose.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It was very challenging and I had to think outside the box. Looking forward to more.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great book, kept me on the edge of my seat! Couldn't put it down! A lot of moving pieces I'm the boo which made it a fun read.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|I gave this 5 stars b/c it is the exact same twilight doll that goes with the rest of my daughter's collection.<br />It arrived quickly and in great shape. I absolutely recommend this doll.

B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book is just a dictionary, there is really nothing special about it. So I will give it a 3*.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chromecast has great pontential. I'm looking forward to having more options on apps, currently it only has netflix and youtube.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A must read for anyone who's ever doubted their faith or inability to overcome life's obstacles. Adam was a true American hero and warrior. I will definitely reread this book again.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Very good, but not as intense as the others in the series.  Mitch seems to be mellowing a lot faster than I would have liked. He is not in danger of  wearing dresses any time soon, but that edge is just not there.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|But the typos in it are a distraction and should be cleaned up - out of simple respect for the work, itself.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love hidden object games and if you do too you will also enjoy it. It is challenging, an d fun.<br />The objects are hidden enough to be challenging and the cheats help when you get stuck.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|When I first came across this game, I was super excited and thrilled, especially since I love minions like crazy. The only thing I was disappointed about was at how long it took to download. Other than that, this is a cute, fun, and addicting game that is totally worth downloading (even though it takes up a lot of space). Small kids will love this app! My little brother is continuously talking about it and was the one who got me to install it on my kindle.
B001HN69AY|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this movie! I already knew I loved it but having my own copy is great. The movie was delivered right on time and in great condition. The case was still wrapped in the plastic that you get when you buy a new movie. The disk wasn't scratched at all. Wonderful experience buying from here and will again soon.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love \\"Cut the Rope\\"! It's super fun, slightly challenging, and never gets boring. Best of all, this app only costs 99 cents! It may be a bit hard for the younger ones to play, but they will surely enjoy getting the candy to Om Nom and putting a smile on his face. This is one of the best apps I've ever downloaded. I'm so addicted to it now that I want to purchase all of the \\"Cut the Rope\\" versions.
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book tells our thinking logics influenced by System I and II system but both systems are of different characteristics leading to different consequences in terms of errors and biases.<br /><br />It is an interesting book to allow us to adjust our blind-spot for our thinking system and it is highly recommended to read for fun and further, improves your &#34;academic&#34; knowledge.
0316219266|5.0|I am a dedicated Amazon shopper when comparing products.  I live in the rural Rocky Mountain west and the hunt for the right product for any job, for a special food product, or the right book has not been easy---until Amazon made it so.  I just finished this book and I enjoy business histories and the total story  Brad Stone has done a great job on this book and the speed and skill of the times and the application of the electronic world around us really comes into focus.  I now understand the vast impact of many of these businesses and especially Amazon.<br /><br />When prices go down, the standard of living goes up for people.  Amazon has improved my life over the years and now I know why.  Ironically the only people I really get to know in doing business with this company are the fine UPS drivers that have stopped at my various places of residence over the last decade.<br /><br />The amount of information on items and the reviews are way beyond what most stores can provide.  Cooking is a major hobby and the source of fine products still astounds me along with detailed info about them.<br /><br />If you want to understand the modern internet world, this is the book to read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Out of all the games I have this one is my most favorite and my dad loves it too and so does my mom.If I could say one thing about this game there would be no negatives thanks for a good game.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Good until level 4 then flash light does not work. Think it would have been good if it actually worked
B008VPC9WS|1.0|On the very first pages of the ebook has been said that you have to receive the link to download the listening/speaking software, but I didn't received any. This is an incomplete product, don't buy it.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Large robots?  Check!  Large monsters?  Check!  Non-stop action?  Check!  Excellent story, excellent special effects...just a fun, fun movie to watch!
B003EYVXXW|5.0|A great movie to watch; shows how a certain religious belief can be turned against another group and then breaks up friends who once could share common debates, discussions, knowledge and without dogma or fear of discussion. The sad part was watching that &#34;again&#34; another woman was used as the pawn for the hatred, pain and suffering as a means to prove a male power and control over women who think and have intelligence!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The product is not 100% compatible with all devices, you can not get MAC address unless you are in a android device,<br /><br />At the begining was displaying few short clips, but afer an upgrade from google it just did not work at all what so ever....
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is what a comicbook movie is suppose to be like. Sure, there were moments that defy logic but this is not a movie based on reality, it's a comicbook movie. For me, the Hulk stole the show (poor Loki)! Make sure you fast-forward during the credits because there are 2 after-credit buttons.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I am completely addicted. Can not stop watching the series. I have never enjoyed a show as much as I enjoy The Shield. In one week I am almost done with season four, and I work and go to school full time each.
1250038820|5.0|Love the book, the stories behind the photos, the artistry and beauty of it. Would make a great gift for anyone who has a soft spot for NYC...
0385350864|2.0|Bridget Jones is back, sans Mark Darcy.  Some funny bits, some pathetic bits. Wouldn't recommend you buy it, but maybe check it out of the library for a beach read....<br />I guess I do understand why Darcy was dumped, but there could have been another way to write this as Darcy was a very well developed and interesting character, handsome, rich and flawed in many ways. I don't read books to become depressed, I read them to be entertained, and this one lacked the spark of the other two books.
B00957T6X6|5.0|An amazing bunch of characters to love or hate.  The complex array of story lines are impressively done.  Can't wait to read what comes next!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player. really good paraphernalia, you will enjoy it. the movies look crispy in my TV.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is super cute and a lot of fun. you get to dress up the minion in fun outfits and get to earn bananas
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy tying to find the clues hidden in oder to escape the various rooms. It is keeping me engaged.
B008JFUORW|5.0|I think I laughed more watching this one than the other two.  I literally couldn't believe anyone would be sick enough to put that giraff scene in the movie. I would have been traumatised for life.  Mr CHOW was NOT funny at all (huge disappointment), but John Goodman was great.  The motherload of all endings happened right after the credits rolled! That really knock'er out of the park (wink wink, eh Stew?). That leaves open an opportunity for another movie. I wanna know how Stew got that set of twins! They sure were a scream!  Listen, if you want to believe poor reviews, just rent it first. It really is a great part of the collection. Hooooowwwwwwwllllllllllll, was Alan ever wrong!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Love love love supernatural! Since the day the show started I have been hooked! Now that I've completed the set so far I need to catch up so I can watch the season on tv!
039916409X|5.0|I can't say how much we have gotten out of Margaret's work.  I am so grateful there is now a book to reach more people.<br /><br />Margaret is truly a gifted and brilliant woman - she so easily and in such a real way connects us into being able to see and access the self limiting beliefs around money, success and finances.  But I have to say - her work has taken me so much deeper.  It is impossible to clear the self limiting beliefs around money, without also in the process uncovering other self limiting beliefs.  Financial success is just one aspect of our lives, an outward and physical expression to ourselves and the world.<br /><br />After following Margaret's work for 2-3 years now in regards to monetary success and seeing results - I knew this year when I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer - that these very same techniques were going to be key in restoring my health and healing my mind and body.  I have to say, it was scary decision to follow an alternative treatment for cancer, but that is what I felt led to do - and I was able to apply these same techniques that Margaret teaches about money/success into my arsenal for dealing with my health crisis.  It is been the most wonderful year of my life - and I can't think of any better adjunct therapy.  (By the way, I'm doing great and feeling great! :)<br /><br />You may think this review is a bit off track - but I want you to know - I share this - because Margaret's work is so much deeper than just making money.  It is about becoming your highest self in every part of your life.<br /><br />Margaret - if you read this - know that you have an amazing gift - and I am so grateful that you are shining your light through this book sharing your very important gift with the world.<br /><br />Here's to health and wealth - in body, spirit.... and of course in the bank account!
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|In a Tidal Wave of Mystery is a wonderful throw back tune that reminds me of my college days in late '80's.  I really enjoyed this tune and find myself thinking about those good ole days a little more now.  Kudos to Capital Cities.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I found the book gripping although there was a part where it felt stuck, but the ending came fast and was truly worth it. It made me think about war, survival, peace and leadership.
0399159347|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author, and I plan on reading more of her works.  I especially liked her character development, even though I had a hard time keeping everyone straight at first.  Once I learned just who everyone was, the story moved along alot faster.  Though I guessed what was in the letter before it was told in the book, I still enjoyed the unraveling and the twists and turns.  I especially liked the Epilogue......you don't get too many of these in novels, and this one was unique.  It made me think back to the many twists and turns of my own life and how different everything could have been if I had not been in a certain place at a certain time.  Pretty scary to think of sometimes.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This season continues to show the magic of having great actors, an excellent script and superb production that make this series so very special.
B004WR125O|3.0|This item is finicky,  connection is not as strong as I would like it to be.  It often cuts out and have had to reset network setting multiple times.  I wish I would have bought the bluetooth link instead.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I highly recommend the game. Great design. Simple mechanics. Very addictive.<br /><br />so far I have gotten a lot out of it without spending money.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|Every class conscious parent, especially those who fawn over pedigree and fame, ought to be required to watch this film.
1781162646|5.0|I really enjoyed King's Joyland. I had seen some negative ratings, and wasn't sure what to expect. Joyland exceeded my expectations in every way. It is one of my favorite King stories now, up there on my list by Bag of Bones. I felt like Joyland was a lot like Bag of Bones, though I can't exactly put my finger on why. It might be the first person point of view, the great characters, the element of a child who can see what others can not, and the relationship of the protagonist to the child. In any case, I had the same feelings when i listen to Joyland when I listened to Bag of Bones. I listen (or read) to Bag of Bones usually twice a year, sometimes 3 times. I can see myself adding Joyland to my repeat listen list.<br /><br />Michael Kelly did an excellent job narrating. He was perfect, perfect inflection, perfect tone, perfect voice all around. I expecially appreciated how he read the children and female characters. Many men read female voices as nasal and valley girl, which totally ruins the story for me. Kelly did a great job, and I could enjoy the story. In fact, I felt the narration added to the story rather than just disappeared into it.<br /><br />So, I went back and read some of the negative reviews, and they mostly seem to be a negative reaction to the fact that Joyland isn't a blood and guts, scary HORROR story. As if horror is ALL that Kind writes. King has never written ONLY blood and guts scary horror. He writes fantasy and sci-fi to horror to the strange and fantastic. I would say all his writing has elements that carry through all of his works, but not all of them are the same. Joyland is a ghost story, but that's not the only story. There is also a story about a young man and a woman, a young man and a sick child, an amusement park, and so on. King's works are always stories within stories within people and Joyland fits that mold. If you like King for his well drawn characters, fantastic yet somehow down to earth and believable plots and settings andthe way he can make those people and places come alive, then you will probably like Joyland. If you are only interested in blood and guts and scary horror, you might not like Joyland at all.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Having been to India, I really enjoyed this film, not only for the acting ensemble and the sentiment, but also for the cinematography and authentic presentation of life over several segments of Indian society.
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|I have quite a library of Alan Jackson music but this is not my favorite kind of music. He has talent and for blue grass lovers it must be a great album, just not for me. I listened to the whole album and then put it away. I doubt if i'll ever listen to it again.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|I love scary flicks and this is the only one where I turned off my tv, turned on all lights and stayed u before I could go to sleep. That man's face scared something in me that I never felt. I finished watching it with the lights on and company.

B0037Z8SLI|1.0|A boring description of his career where he found checklists useful at times. An absolute waste of money and time
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It drains my battery very fast. Does maintain working and my battery of Kindle last not much. Please use the previous version
B004EBZX6W|5.0|We have had it for over a year now, monitoring our wifi, and that and it works great.  Recommend it highly.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Wonderful animation!  Great music!  Great story theme!  A great movie for the entire family ---from seniors down to  pre-school  age.  This movie will brighten your day/night and keep you singing and dancing for a very long time.
B00632HWOG|5.0|We have had it for over a year now, reading our email and writing short emails, and it works great.  I wish gmail and outlook.com would prepare a app as good as this one.  Recommend it highly.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great story theme!  Good animation and creativity throughout presentation.  A very good dvd for not only 5-8 year olds ---but also for teenagers and adults.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|have had it for over a year now, waking up when it tells me and that and it works great.  Recommend it highly.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is fun but it cheases people at the end, especially if the last number they give makes a bingo! They don't give more time for people to make that bingo! It sometimes freeze it the game.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|We have had it for about a year now, printing from the PDF reader mostly using a HP wireless printer, and that and it works great.  Recommend it highly.

B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good game but should have hints. Would help when stuck on a level. Otherwise a good game. Definitely makes you think.
B006VREHRS|5.0|First of all this is PG+ so keep that in mind. It's well done with an excellent storyline. If you are from NJ you will appreciate the scenery and comments, especially about Mayor Hague of Jersey City.
B006LSZECO|4.0|never expect it-good read. Could not put the book down  and I've heard this from others as well keep it up
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|At the highest level the dice rolls do not seem very random.  Out of 20 games the first move went to the computer 17 times.  Also, if you are trying to get a piece back on the board you seem to roll whatever number the computer is sitting on.  The game is fun but I believe it would be better if it were really random dice tosses.
B000W8HC8I|4.0|Easy captivating read, interesting insight into an unreal life experience.  From the unimaginable wealth and waste to the extreme details of drug fueled insanity and recovery...every page was entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game, you need to play it. It's so addicting and fun that you will never get enough of it. Seriously play it now
B00594XOZU|1.0|I LOVE kik and I have tried to login  a MILLION times and it does not work plz fix my life depends on kik now it does not :(
B008O5NH2Q|5.0|Over several decades, I have read this book at least three times.  I have used the methods Dr. Murphy describes to control the subconscious mind for many years, especially in the área of personal health.  The methods are not fantasy.  They are the truth.  Anyone who adopts the methods recommended in this book, and sincerely practices them, will realize wonderful results.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game is fun and not too complicated.  I enjoy games where I can begin playing without spending an hour reading instructions.
B0088EDMMS|2.0|I have seen movies that are far worse than this one, to be fair. And I wouldn't be so indignant if it had a 3 star rating... but 4.7 average!? What's wrong with you people? I have to endure this turd daily right now, as my 3 year old gives it a 5 star rating and has it on repeat. I think the average reviewer's age is 40+ years older than she is, so I think this movie's rating is actually an indirect commentary on the degradation of our society. What the average reviewer is saying here is that this movie is up there with Saving Private Ryan, The Godfather, Casa Blanca, etc., etc. etc. Using the same yard stick for art appreciation, Yoko Ono is in the pantheon of great artists like Da Vinci and Michelangelo.<br />If you read this review and you still intend to submit your own 5 star review for this movie, go take a good, long look in the mirror first. If you still like what you see, then God help us all. We had a good run for a while.
B006BFK5DK|3.0|I will always love EW&F and buy their music. But they are not the same EW&F without Maurice White.<br />I was expecting music similar to the EW&F of the 70s/80s, not quite.<br />Still trying to discern Larry Dunn's keyboards.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This is a great coming of age story about a group of misfit boys who begin an adventure to find One Eyed Willy's lost treasure. The story is set in the 1980's with a teen something Josh Brolin trying to keep his younger brother and his friends  under control, while safely at home. This movie has great shots of the scenic Oregon Coast, action, adventure and a few bad guys chasing after them.<br />It's a great comedy for the family, with plenty of action and adventure for all. A great classic in the making.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Stock up on available snacks and clear your schedule—when you get a 10tons match-3 game, be prepared to do nothing else for as long as it takes to finish it.<br /><br />Azkend throws in a hidden object micro-game to the usual 10tons feature of having a variety of power-ups that you unlock and strategically choose from in later levels.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great humor coupled with lots of action.  I liked the comic book simplicity without excessive profanity, sex, and bloody gore.<br />Even with all the explosive action and shooting there was minimal blood and guts.  Entertaining with a great cast of characters.
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|Can't be the end of the series, but by far the best.  Didn't want it to end but couldn't put it down.  All the various mysteries playing with and against each other makes it a keep reading book.  Loved it!
B000MRA6AK|5.0|One of my all time favorite jazz pianists.  Nice to be able to replace old vinyl pieces that don't play well with crisp new cds.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love this game but I think they should improve some things like when I try to log in and play multiplayer on this game it won't let me also they should have more realms weapons and they should add side quests and also they should have a multiplayer boss battle and single player also and that's it for this review
1781162646|1.0|What makes me write a negative review is that Stephen King didn't surprise me at all in this book. Long descriptions of irrelevant details, same hackneyed style, same little boy with extrasensory ability. If you're into long detailed descriptions of every doorknob and are ok with the actual story on the last 5 pages on the novel - this story is for you. Also, if you're reading SK just for his writing style - that's a good reason to buy a book as well.
0195145925|3.0|I bought this book because it's author, Julian Barbour, was featured on an episode of &#34;Through the Wormhole&#34; on Science Channel. I was intrigued by the argument, put forward among others with Barbour, that time wasn't real. It was nothing more than a human construct to help us cope with our reality. I found myself agreeing with this the more I thought about it. But it is opposed by a number of other scientists and of course actually goes against Einstein's theory of relativity. Because of that I wanted to get Barbour's book in order to understand the logic behind his argument. Unfortunately I am not a trained physicist or mathematician so I was really unable to fathom his points. That is no fault of the author though. I thought he tried to be a lucid as possible. It's just that I think anyone reading his book should have a good base in spatial geometry and physics. I was able to understand the &#34;Double slit experiment&#34; and was somewhat familiar with Hugh Everett's &#34;Many World's Theory&#34;. But I knew about both before I read this book. I forced myself to read the entire book, but I was simply unable to fully understand it. I would think however that a person with a better background than I would be able to appreciate it more.
0785139168|2.0|I was excited to try this out and really liked the representation of Elizabeth on the cover. The art inside though is nothing like this. All five girls look overly sexualized with huge pouty lips. Worse - they are nearly indistinguishable from each other apart from hair color/style. This is including Mary Bennet...which....seems like a pretty big oversight given her plain appearance is a major part of her character. I know the story line in and out, so I was really hoping to enjoy the artistry here and was disappointed.

B009VIZDLI|3.0|Easy fun read. Overtones of Sheldon from the tv show. Predictable ending but what the heck.<br />Enjoyable book to read on holiday.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|I couldn't wait to have this in my collection. My fiancee and I saw it in theaters and we had a blast. The movie is very enjoyable, and while it may not be your typical Hayao Miyazaki movie, it is way better than Earthsea was. Fantastic bit of storytelling.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!  I couldn't out it down. Defiantly a page turner! Very well written. I would recommend this to all my friends.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Thought, with the rave reviews, this would be a page-turner. Hard to get into, and a surprise ending, which didn't make any sense at all. But then, it's fiction.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Perfect book! I couldn't put it down. I loved the story. I loved the characters.  Really,really well done. I would definitely read another book by Liane Moriarty.

B00637TV1I|5.0|So I've only just discovered these guys, but I'm greedily listening to everything I can find.  This band is addictive!  Truly, if you can listen to &#34;City Girl&#34; and not be hooked... well, the genre just isn't for you.  That being said, most of the album is incredible and it's hard to be disappointed with these guys... they're sort of like taking Siouxsie Sioux and the Banshees... mixing in a bit of the Edge from U2... hmmm... and maybe just a bit of Concrete Blonde... modernizing the whole mixture and adding an epic drum line... yea, I think that might describe them =)
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A great read, many funny moments, any Star Trek TOS fan with a sense of humor will love this book.

B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|I really like Will Smith as an actor.  His kid, however, has a lot of work to do.  He's still young so maybe he'll get it, and establish himself eventually, but he just doesn't have it yet.<br />The last movie I saw him in was probably that Karate Kid remake and he at least sounded like he was speaking naturally.  In After Earth, he seems to be trying to manufacture a \\"black accent\\" that just doesn't fit.  Maybe he's been learning from his homeboy Justin Bieber, but sorry Jaden, Bieber sounds more black than you.<br />As far as the movie goes, it's not bad.  Not great, but not terrible either.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was great, in the beginning hard to keep characters seperate but once I got past that I couldn't put it down
B00D3LA71K|5.0|Excellent movie with Matthew McDonaughey.  Would recommend.  A movie I could watch again.  Love him anyway and it was very entertaining.  Did not have a chance to see it at the theatre and was happy to have had the chance to purchace it..
1419702238|5.0|My son loved this one.  He's 11 and has ready them all.  We pre-ordered the new one as well.  Great series and my son keeps reading! That's what it's all about....
B00AFROVQC|1.0|The author had some good ideas and this is where the positives end. There are so many mistakes in the book but more than that, the characters and the plotlines are ridiculous. I can't believe that this is a multibook series. I do give the author credit for sticking with the series and producing so many books. Maybe her writing improves.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Debated ordering this or a wireless system.  In the end, I am glad I opted for this one.  I am a Realtor and use it for real estate videos on both my iPhone (with adapter) and my Canon T4i dSLR<br /><br />PROs:<br />- The cord is very long so you can stand a decent distance away and let the cable hang down.<br />- Inexpensive, easy to use plug-and-play solution.<br />- Makes a positive difference vs the standard mic.<br />- Discreet and can clip to your outfit.<br /><br />CONs:<br />- No battery level indicator, only a light on or off.  I've used it for approximately 10 hours and the battery is still alive but no idea when it will quit.<br />- Easy to accidentally switch it on or leave it on... Switch is tiny.<br />- Tie clip looks like it will break easily... But it's a small piece of plastic so naturally you have to take care.<br /><br />In the end, after much debate and reading reviews of every mic possible on amazon, this came out on top for quality and price: highly suggested.

B008476HBM|5.0|I will admit that the first time I tried to read Pride and Prejudice, I was quite young and found it difficult to read.  Now, 'Many' years later, I have again read this classic novel and the story is in every right a true historical classic.  For any who truly love historical regency romance this story is a must!  It is a great read no matter your age and it is the truest view of the regency era a reader will ever find.  LOVE IT!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Here are 3 stories of love, loss, & family that intersect and answer in 3 different ways what love is worth & what it sometimes can cost.<br /><br />You ever stumble upon a letter or a diary that’s not yours.  You know you shouldn’t read it, but your curiosity gets the best of you.  That’s what happens with Cecilia.  She gets her friends to weigh in on “should I or shouldn’t I read it” when she knows she shouldn’t.  Once she reads the letter, her life changes in ways she never imagined.<br /><br />Tess’s lifelong best friend shows her a different side of “friendship” and makes Tess question their friendship, her familial obligations, and if she’s responsible the mess she finds herself in.  Tess has an unforgettable line that I really like:  “Marriage was a form of insanity; love hovering permanently on the edge of aggravation.”<br /><br />Rachel’s loss has made her sad and fueled resentment.  Once she realizes her resentment has been misplaced, her, she also realizes what it has cost her.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book.  Liane Moriarty interwove these stories and characters seamlessly and swept you up in the highs & lows.  She made you want have conversations with the main characters and offer guidance or just a listening ear.

1250038820|3.0|I hate to break the 5-star roll, but the honest truth is that the blog is better. I was super excited to have a curated set of Brandon's absolute best photos and quotes, but most do not include anecdotes and just say \\"Seen in _____\\". As a native New Yorker, I would also add that several neighborhoods were labeled incorrectly: a hot dog shop in Gowanus was wrongly labeled as Red Hook; a corner in Gramercy was labeled \\"Lower Midtown\\" (a term Brandon or his editor invented-- it is used neither on maps nor colloquially).<br /><br />Furthermore, there are too many similar photos; there is a limit to how many times I can be captivated by women with half-shaven heads. He's also included a lot of low-quality photos that don't tell a story and are trying too hard to be aesthetic: a plain woman in a red coat against a red and white background for instance. These seem like earlier amateur works. They would be interesting to see on the blog as evidence of how the project has matured, but in a book where each page is precious real estate, these photos lack depth and feel like filler.<br /><br />In the blog, oftentimes the quotes speak louder than the photos, and that is why I follow HONY. So I can meet the people of my city through his interviews. The stories humanize the subjects; they allow us to go beyond the surface of skin and cloth. But as I said, most of the photos in the book do not have those accompanying quotes. I find myself moved by a much, much larger percentage of photos on the blog than in this book. But I commend Brandon for making his book dream come true. I think the next edition will be better. Stick to the format of the blog! Photos and anecdotes and no filler! :)
140006922X|5.0|My conclusion is that Aslan is well qualified as an intellectual biblical scholar.  His description of the times of Jesus is excellent.  He provides a very enlightening review of the Roman occupation through the destruction of the temple and near eradication of the Jerusalem versions of Judaism and Christianity.<br /><br />Although (as far as I can tell) his historical facts are quite accurate and well referenced, he draws some unsubstantiated, reasonable conclusions that are at odds with traditional Christian thinking.  I do not consider this a problem for the seasoned Christian since it is fairly easy to separate facts from the author’s speculations.  However, for a new or naïve Christian, the book may be problematic.  There are several conclusions at odds with traditional Christian thinking:  Jesus saw himself as a political messiah, who would usher in the kingdom of God; i.e., he would lead a revolt in order to restore Israel to be under God’s control.  He meant what he said (literally) with the quote, “I come not to bring peace but a sword.”  He did not consider himself divine nor to be the savior of the world.  Aslan considered the religion of Paul to be quite at odds with that of Jesus and his immediate followers.  He presents a very interesting discussion of a bitter divide between Paul and the Jerusalem Christian leaders that is only hinted at in Scripture.<br /><br /> On the other hand, Aslan makes no attempt to minimize Jesus’ reputation as a divine healer, and does not deny the resurrection.  He seems to accept post resurrection experiences of disciples without endorsing the resurrection as historical.<br /><br />Even though many of my convictions are at odds with Aslan’s, I give his book five stars because it is very interesting, enlightening, and challenging.  Aslan is to be commended for sharing his extensive research and thoughtful conclusions.

Some might find it too simplistic but to them I would suggest they ask themselves why they didn't get more out of it? In other words, there IS something in this book for anyone struggling to achieve something.<br /><br />If you're thinking about it stop, just buy it and keep it handy forever.

0307352153|5.0|This book needs to be read. This has changed my view on everything from close friends, co-workers, my little brother and my self. It sets introverts on the agenda, and explains the power of quiet in a great way. It's also a book that confirms and legitimizes many of the insecurities of an introvert. A must read for everyone that wants to learn about people in general.
0393061310|5.0|Jared Diamond is possibly one of the great popular science writers of our time. His explanation of how our planet shaped our history, sheds new light and new twists on how much we are in control of our history as humans. How much were the fates of human population sealed in the first few thousand years after the big move out of Africa? Why some got germs, guns and steel and others none? The question goes in surprising many levels and puts forward intriguing models in an original manner, brilliantly explained.

B00119ZMKW|5.0|Stargate SG-1 is a prime example of an action sci-fi show. A winning formula (as is evident by its 10 year run(not including Stargate Atlantis)) was stumbled upon with this show. Including long story arcs, as well as short arcs wrapping up, most of the time, within each episode. While watching Stargate SG-1 i not only enjoyed the story plots, but also the character developments, as well as the first class acting skills of much of the cast. Anyone interested in action sci-fi should most certainly, at the least, give Stargate SG-1 a watch. Despite the fact that there is indeed some &#34;cheese&#34; in the show, overall it is a shinning example of the genre.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Great protagonist, other characters just as good.<br /><br />Surrendering to implacable fate, fulfilling (his her its) destiny. Wow. A great read.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Well, it had a few interesting concepts.  But basically, it was lacking in plot, character development, or interest.  I like WIll Smith.  I like hard science fiction.  I do.  This could have been written by a twelve year-old.  Sure watch for the action, but have a backup plan.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|I don't care for Zombie movies. Here I made an exception, because I like Brad Pitt and this seemed like a different kind of Zombie movie. The first 1/2 hour was pretty good. After that the rest of the movie seemed to slough through the typical Zombie slugfest. The ending was interesting and different. Not quite like 29 days, which in my opinion is perhaps the best Zombie movie of the 21st century.

B002RI9YE6|5.0|I have no idea why it has taken me so long to read this novel, despite having read most of this authors work and loved it, and yet this, deservedly, is regarded as his classic. Perhaps, subconsciously, I was afraid of being disappointed but, if so, then I am glad to say that I certainly was not. In many ways, this is classicaly understated; as English as you can possibly imagine. Stevens has spent his entire life and career in service, as a butler, with thirty five years working for Lord Darlington at Darlington Hall. When we meet him it is 1956 and the days of the aristocracy and great houses are dying out. Darlington Hall is now in the hands of Mr Farraday, an untitled American, who is a kind and thoughtful man. So thoughtful is he that, when intending to go abroad, he encourages Stevens to take a trip of his own, even offering the use of his own car. This isolated and repressed man decides to visit Miss Kenton, now Mrs Barr, the former housekeeper at Darlington Hall.<br /><br />During Stevens journey, he muses on his past life. It is fair to say that Stevens has spent most of his time building barriers between himself and others. His entire reason for living has been to serve Lord Darlington, who we gradually realise is undeserving of such utter loyalty. Meanwhile, his feelings for Miss Kenton, and hers for him, are poignantly revealed. Kazuo Ishiguro is a genius of an author and much of the substance of this outstanding novel lies in what he doesn't say (or write), as much as what he does - an almost impossible task for any other author. His gentle unveiling of the absurd posturing of Stevens, his inability to deal with either his own, or others, feelings, his sad regret, and Miss Kenton's attempts to breach his defences are heart rending. This is one of the most touching, and brilliantly written, novels I have read.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Since, probably the early nineties, McCartney has (Unfairly) been dismissed by a lot of music critics as a recording artist with nothing more offer, this seems to have taken a great weight of expectancy  off McCartney's shoulders, resulting in an outstanding run of studio albums (Flaming Pie, Driving Rain, Chaos & Creation, Memory almost full & Electric Arguments).<br />This winning streak continues (mostly) with \\"New\\".<br />The big talking point with this new record is the four producers, but oddly if you weren't told of this fact, I don't think you would have guessed, with not a massive amount of diversity in the production of the tracks.  There could have been a bit more experimentation; \\"Appreciate\\" really the only example of McCartney's left-field attitude to music (most Paul McCartney fans I'm sure are also quite broadminded in their musical tastes & would not have minded a few more challenging songs).<br />Plus when an artist records with a single producer on a project, they usually build up a strong relationship, with each party bringing something important to the table.<br />As for the songs themselves, they're mostly quite complex, with lots of over-dubs (I think each producer was trying to stamp their individual mark on the record). On one hand this means that repeated listens to the album unlocks sounds & bit of music you miss on previous listens, but on the other hand it could be deemed over-egging the pudding just a little. It's just a shame there aren't any simple, stripped down tracks which McCartney does so well, to give the record a bit more diversity.<br />As for the extra tracks, \\"Turned Out\\" is a great retro rocker in a similar vain to \\"Save Us\\", \\"Get me out of Here\\" has a nice bluesy Led Zeppelin feel to it, the hidden track \\"\\"How much you mean to me\\" is your bog standard piano ballad that McCartney can write in his sleep, still worth paying the extra for though.<br />There is always a unfair hope that McCartney's next album is going to be as good as Sgt Pepper, which I know is ridiculous, but there's always a small part of your brain that always thinks so.<br />So a good, if not outstanding album, I don't think it's a strong as \\"Chaos & Creation\\" & \\"Memory almost Full\\", but his done a lot worse in his career.ood as Sgt Pepper, which I know is ridiculous, but there's always a small part of your brain that always thinks so.<br />So a good, if not outstanding album, I don't think it's a strong as \\"Chaos & Creation\\" & \\"Memory almost Full\\", but his done a lot worse in his career.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Just about the most self-deprecatingly hilarious novel.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is probably my favorite Jane Austen movie and certainly my favorite version of Persuasion.  The acting brings out such stifled anxiety and tension that it still feels like a miracle when things work out in the end, even though I've seen it several times!
B0006ZFQP8|4.0|I think that in order to avoid getting bogged down in debate over whether singers such as Margaret Price have any business singing a role which they would not - and indeed, in her case never did - attempt on stage, this recording is best viewed as a product of the recording studio rather than an attempt to replicate a live performance, and devised in order to enshrine the conception of a great conductor making the best of the resources available to him. Undoubtedly the DG engineers' adjustments are enabling lighter voiced artists to be heard but the same could be said of the covered pit at Bayreuth and to this day true Wagner singers who may be properly heard over the orchestra are as rare as hen's teeth.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly beautifully played and directed; Kleiber's sensitivity and lyricism infuse every bar but he also packs a punch at the climactic conclusions of Acts 1 and 2. Being a devotee of the live 1966 recording at Bayreuth conducted by B&ouml;hm, I miss a certain propulsion in passages such as the &#34;O sink hernieder&#34; duet and too often his singers are almost crooning not just because they lack vocal heft but because a Lieder-like restraint and delicacy are clearly what the conductor has demanded of them. That can pay dividends: this is clearly the most minutely prepared of recordings with every textual and musical nuance thought through for maximum impact; nothing is skimped or blandly performed.<br /><br />Fischer-Dieskau croons and fakes notes because by this stage of his career - the set was recorded between August 1980 and April 1982 - the juice has gone out of his voice and he no longer has the resources but he creates a bluff, credible Kurwenal. Kollo's voice is always an odd assemblage of incongruities: he has little legato and can quickly lose tonal lustre, either yelling or almost marking, but he rarely defaults into the guttural emphasis or pronounced bleat which sometimes marred his singing and he sounds suitably youthful, delivering the words with exemplary expression. His ravings aren't painful in the way some Tristans can be. Vinay, Heppner, Treptow, Vickers or - least of all - Melchior he ain't - but he's nonetheless better than passable. Fassbaender keeps her wide vibrato under control and rises to the fierce, sustained tessitura of a role which often lies as high as Brangaene's mistress; she brings a master Lieder recitalist's acuity to her text. The smaller parts of the Young Sailor and Melot are taken by mediocre singers, the former glottal and the latter making little impact in his tiny but crucial interventions.<br /><br />The glories of this set, however, apart from Kleiber's concept and the playing of the Dresdeners, are Kurt Moll's predictably moving and sonorous Marke and Margaret Price's shining Isolde. Her voice has qualities similar to those of Gundula Janowitz, whose predominately lyrical and fluting soprano had sufficient spinto power, stamina and legato to undertake &#34;lighter&#34; Wagnerian roles on stage. She may be artificially boosted but the result is thrilling; I haven't enjoyed a &#34;recent&#34; (comparatively, in terms of recorded history) Isolde as much since Linda Esther Gray's superlative recording for Goodall - and she could pull it off live on stage, too. Price's flawless German and thrilling top, honed in her celebrated Strauss roles, in combination with a serviceable lower register and a real actress's delivery combine to enable her to deliver the recorded performance of a lifetime, regardless of her practical limitations. There is nothing matronly (Flagstad?) or chromium-plated (Nilsson?) about her vulnerable, passionate, wild and almost girlish Isolde; she's terrific.<br /><br />Its faults notwithstanding, being now available in superb sound at a bargain price on three discs with a full, trilingual libretto, this set should be in the collection of any devotee of this greatest of operas.vering the words with exemplary expression.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The franchise never fails to deliver. Especially liked the roll reversal of Kirk and Spock. Cumberbatch was awesome as Khan.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|It's a silly movie about superhuman zombies.  Yes, watching super zombies climbing over a wall to get at the clueless singing folks within was sort of amusing, but that's about all.  Didn't care about the characters.  The ending, which is more of a set up for part 2, was just plain silly.  As for Brad Pitt's family life: I couldn't care less.  Personally, I enjoyed the South Park spoof on this movie a lot more than the movie itself.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Intelligent and funny as always. Enjoy the cast the crew in the direction of each show. Highly recommend you add this to your Big Theory Collection.
1476727651|5.0|Top form.  The little boy in the Shining has grown up and become a drunk.  However, he manages to pull himself out of the bottle and is ready to fight evil.  This book has interesting villians and even has a good ending(often the main weakness in King's stories are his endings).  He even manages to keep his bizarre political views to a minimum.  He does kind of blow it in the afterward when he blasts the movie version of \\"the Shining\\"(Hey, Stephen, the movie versions of \\"Carrie\\" or \\"the Shining\\" was how many of your future readers were introduced to your works, so don't bite the hand that feeds you.).  However, despite the author's petulance, this is a first rate novel, I'd recommend without reservation.

B00EUS9JF0|5.0|The first single from Paul McCartney's most recent studio effort, the title track, \\"New,\\" was upbeat and catchy, but it in no way prepared me for just how good the album to which it lends its name was going to be. On \\"New,\\" the album, McCartney is, remarkably, at the height of his considerable powers, offering a consistently inspired set that hearkens back to the earliest days of his career while still managing to break new ground, and hinting that a bright future may yet (even at this late date) be ahead of him.<br /><br />Much has been made of the fact that no fewer than four producers contributed to the project, but the whole coheres beautifully, and the varied musical approaches lend the finished album a breadth and depth that recalls the eclectic psychedelic albums of the Beatles' mid-sixties heyday. For the first time in decades, McCartney's lyrics, often uneven, and thus, problematic over the course of his solo career, are consistently finely-wrought and evocative throughout, recalling such classics as \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"For No One\\" of the \\"Revolver\\" era, while at the same time expanding and sharpening his lyrical palette, and never sounding like a half hearted attempt to recapture past glories. \\"Early Days\\" and \\"On My Way To Work\\" sketch a bygone era vividly, in a few deft strokes. The effervescent pop confection \\"New\\" contains less \\"meat,\\" so to speak, but it does what it needs to do, perfectly. Similarly, the tighter, more immediate lyrics to the anthems \\"Save Us\\" and \\"Everybody Out There\\" are expertly turned: they may say nothing unexpected or startling, but they deliver their message in a memorable, meaningful way.<br /><br />Musically, the album rocks harder, and is edgier, than many McCartney solo efforts, but the propulsive drive of the heavier tracks is beautifully balanced by the acoustic delicacy of quieter numbers such as the aforementioned \\"Early Days\\" and the hidden closer \\"Scared,\\" which features McCartney accompanying himself on piano, with a heartrendingly fragile and vulnerable vocal. The album's cutting edge feel, however, reflects the influence of the younger producers McCartney has employed, and lends the proceedings contemporary tone that makes it clear that this is music that will remain relevant well into the (still fairly) new century.<br /><br />Some may quibble with individual songs here, but for my part, after several  listenings, I can honestly say that there are no tracks in this collection that I dislike; at this point, I would find it difficult even to pick favorites. This is perhaps the former Beatle's most consistently satisfying outing since \\"Band on the Run,\\" now forty years ago. Bravo, Macca! Long may you reign.<br /><br />Oh, in conclusion, one piece of advice--spend the extra money for the Deluxe Edition. The bonus tracks are as fine as anything on the standard version of the album, and well worth a few extra dollars.a heartrendingly fragile and vulnerable vocal.

B009IF6U98|4.0|I saw \\"Old School\\" when it first came out in the movie theaters. In the intervening years my opinion of it has remained pretty much the same. One of several movies that have been engendered by the truly classic \\"Animal House,\\" \\"Old School\\" is about on par with \\"Road Trip\\" when it comes to plausibility, humor, and grossness.<br /><br />Like \\"Animal House,\\" \\"Old School\\" involves men living together in a fraternity. Unlike \\"Animal House,\\" the fellows in the fraternity aren't in their late teens and early twenties, but are mostly married men, several years beyond college age, whose marriages are on the rocks, and who have decided to move into a house near a college campus and form a fraternity of sorts (one where enrollment in the college is not necessary).<br /><br />There is little in this movie that is the least bit profound, and the storyline is rather thin. However, there are a number of really funny scenes, and Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell in particular do their usual outstanding job of making their characters come alive. Although there are a few scenes that amply warrant the \\"R\\" rating the movie received, for the most part the movie consists of funny, though sometimes sophomoric hijinks. It's a decent enough movie for a few good laughs when vegging on a Friday evening.

B00003CXDG|5.0|Woo's original cut for MI2 was 3 1/2 hours and an 1 hour 1/2 was taken out by the studio!!!!!!!!!!!  The studio asked editor Stuart Baird to cut the R-rated film down to a 120 minutes and make it PG13 rating.  Many scenes were abrievated down to quick annoying flashes with big plot-holes not answered!!!!! The violence was sanitized and now is time for Paramount to release John Woo's intended cut on DVD and BLU-RAY!!!!!!!! Paramount can only stand to make more money from home entertainment then letting the 3 1/2 hour cut to rot in Paramounts movie vaults!!! There would be huge interest in cult director Woo's 3 1/2  hour cut!!!!

0316219266|4.0|I found the book interesting and informative, to see how an outsider views both Jeff and Amazon. Of course, as with any book where the subject is not an active participant, the book is slanted toward those episodes where Stone can find someone to talk about them. And of course, he includes that which supports his thesis.<br /><br />I found the discussion about his biological father to be sensationalistic -- and unnecessarily intrusive to Jeff's family (both his real family and his biological father's family). Its also much easier to be in meetings and recollect the times where someone gets angry and not the times where praise is given.<br /><br />My biggest concern is that I have first-hand knowledge of many of the episodes in the book (high school, original web site, 9/11, earthquake, A9, Manber/Holden, Kindle, Netflix). Overall, from the parts that I know about, about 80% is correct and 20% isn't (often in details, but incorrect nonetheless). That, of course, taints my view of the book as a whole, because I have to assume that 20% of the stuff I don't have personal knowledge of is also incorrect.<br /><br />That said, I would still recommend the book (and especially the picture of Jeff in High School!)

039916409X|5.0|7 years ago I was frustrated with my weight, my relationship status, and my financial outlook when I saw \\"The Secret\\" on Oprah. Hallelujah, the answers to all my woes! This began a flurry of LOA activities -- vision boards, affirmations, following the guidance of Abraham, etc. Reading my journal entries form one year ago none of these had really changed. I then discovered tapping -- a natural companion to LOA. I very quickly found Margaret Lynch's hysterical youtube video, \\"Where's my $50,000\\" and have been tapping with her ever since. Her \\"tell it like it is\\" approach is very unique and refreshing. She has an engaging, personal style and you KNOW that she has been where you are -- and has a step-by-step action plan to help you move through those unconscious blocks with money.<br /><br />It's exciting to see the explosion of EFT (Tapping) -- and \\"Tapping into Wealth\\" is the most comprehensive addition to the literature on creating wealth out there. It is the missing piece of LOA -- concrete, action steps to identify and eliminate the limiting beliefs that have kept me stuck. I feel like she's sitting with me, holding my hand, helping me uncover the programming that I learned from my family and give voice to them -- to finally shift them. This is not a promise of change-over-night, but a guided exploration and shifting of programming that has kept me stuck for far too long -- programming that I would have taken to the grave had I not encountered Margaret Lynch. I now have the opportunity to interface with wealth as an adult and create my own value system around money and wealth -- a scary (more tapping!) but ultimately freeing endeavor.<br /><br />The addition of the bonus videos after each chapter is especially helpful -- I find that it gives me an extra opportunity to really sit with the information in the chapter and get to a deeper level. Margaret's enthusiasm and authenticity really come to life on video and make the words in the book really come alive.<br /><br/>I admire Margaret's desire to \\"take one million people and show them how to shatter the limiting, generational wealth programming so they can earn more money and build more wealth.\\" This book is a cornerstone of that process.<br /><br />I'm happy to be one in million on this journey with Margaret!

Still, it is way ahead of anything in its price category. Apple TV is superior, but it's a lot more money, too. If you are interested in the Chrome environment, you'll like Chromecast.

B008ZDC7M8|5.0|Even though the narrator seems to be anti-Hollywood, I find this journey through cinema very enlightening. So far I am up to episode nine and if I can be frank I was a bit taken aback ( considering he is talking about innovation in film) when he spoke of a character in 2001: A Space Odyssey walking up a wall, I realized he never mentioned Fred Astaire's dance sequence from Royal Wedding. The Wizard of Oz was a last minute mention in one episode as was Gone With the Wind. I'm not exactly sure what Mark Cousins' intent is, and maybe it will become clear as the series ends, but for now I am just watching and letting it unfold.

B00CW7KK9K|4.0|PROS- tracks sleep, elevation gain, along with the usual, syncs to older & new bluetooth devices, unobtrusive, can export data<br />CONS- hard to check bpm, velcro strap fails quickly, no hole for safety leash, display is fuzzy<br /><br />At the time I was selecting activity trackers, this one had the most features, compared to competitors such as FitBit and JawBone. I particularly wanted elevation gain since I hike lots of hills, and learning about my patterns of sleep was a bonus.  Also I needed something that would sync to older bluetooth devices (such as my iPad 2 -- many other trackers only sync to a short list of newer devices).  Overall I'm pleased with the Pulse, but it could be even better.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that it is hard to check your heart rate.  If it is in the clip, you have to remove it from the clip (after removing the clip from what it is attached to) in order to access the optical heart rate sensor.  And then, if I am not standing still, it usually is not able to detect the heart rate, so I have to pause whatever exercise I am doing.  If it is in the wrist strap, I also have trouble with it detecting the heart rate, because the cloth cover keeps me from getting my finger as close as if it is out of the holder.  (And if you want to check your bpm in the middle of the night, you have to leave sleep mode, check your bpm, then return to sleep mode.)<br /><br />Secondly, both the clip and the wristband have problems.  I really really want a little hole to put a safety leash, but there is none.  The clip holds this tiny device very well, but I have had the clip itself almost slide out of the pocket I had it clipped to.  It does hold very tightly, which makes it hard to access when I want to check my bpm.  The wristband is very comfortable and attaches with some mini-velcro, but unfortunately, the velcro quit holding after only two weeks of night-time use (probably due to fuzzy bed lint).  [Withings replied promptly to my complaint and is going to replace it, but won't the same thing happen again?  I am now reinforcing the closure with a rubber band.]<br /><br />The elevation tracking is great for exercise, but I don't know if it makes sense to accumulate for the whole day, because it can get wild figures when weather passes over (since it infers elevation change from air pressure change, as do other elevation trackers).  What I do is check the elevation before and after hiking, and subtract, and record that figure manually.<br /><br />While it is interesting to look at the patterns of activity overnight, it is annoying to have to manually engage and disengage sleep mode.  Right now if you forget, you cannot later tell it your times of sleep so that it can recharacterize that data, but supposedly that will be a forthcoming improvement.<br /><br />Once I have uploaded the data, I find the website easy to use, though it doesn't do all the analysis and correlation I would like.  For that reason, it is great that you can export the data in a csv table to use as you wish.<br /><br />I was surprised that the glowing display is fuzzy (unlike the crisp photos), and for the first few days, looking at it made me want to find my glasses to make the print more crisp (I don't wear glasses).  I have gotten used to it and don't notice it any more however.s going to replace it, but won't the same thing happen again?

039916409X|5.0|Having money and financial freedom is important to us all (one of Maslow's basic needs in his hierarchy of needs). This is a \\"must-have\\" book. It is written in very simple terms to address how we can all manage our daily lives joyfully and easily to have money, reduce or eliminate debt and live a life with fewer hang-ups and stresses about money.<br /><br />Many people have not heard of or used \\"tapping\\". Ms Lynch takes this fairly new self management technique and introduces it to us in a very understandable way as a useful tool to help manage our financial lives.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the succinct coverage of the book and how personally I can use the suggestions and easy techniques to aid in my financial planning approach. I now have a way to make personal changes much easier and see what was holding me back from having the money I deserve to have.<br /><br />Do put this on your list of books to get this year. It is a wonderful book for yourself or family or friends!!!!
1401242855|4.0|I have the hardcover as well, I purchased this specifically for the mask. It's good quality, a better plastic than a cheap Halloween mask, but still a bit thin. It was expected though. Simple elastic tie to hold onto your hear, and two foam pads above the eyes to keep it from banging into your face. They thought about that one. Only thing missing for me would be black eye covers, but its an easy fix.<br /><br />The graphic novel itself is excellent. Good mystery story. I do love the way Snyder writes, and Capullo's artwork is top notch. They put it all into this, and it shows.
B00E1LT41K|5.0|There has been a huge amount of laughably pompous grouching about the supposed inaccurate historicity of this series. Yes, the 'facts' have been altered or ignored in some cases. But who knows the 'facts'? Anyone who claims to know is simply a fraud. The only real facts to consider are that the series has some excellent acting and provides an interesting, informative and engaging starting point for anyone who wants to do their own research on this lesser known period of English history. Does anyone really believe Shakespeare's history plays are historically accurate? If not how dare they adapt them and make them into films! Next thing you know people will be saying that the bible is a historically accurate account of human history. Dear me!

This is a very good movie.  Blu-ray 3D is excellent.  Great cast, well written and an excellent director make this a great movie to own.  The ease of getting the digital copy is also a  plus.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes great science Fiction.
B005VPRETE|4.0|This was a great little birthday gift for my son's friend.  He loves to play Legos, but she often complains that he doesn't have any &#34;girl&#34; Legos.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|As someone else had written, I also found clues but have no idea what to do with them. I've tapped the entire screen to no avail. Deleting the app due to frustration.
0316322407|5.0|Got this for a gift for my granddaughter who is a junior at University of WI, She just loved the book! Grandma did well!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|It was great. I like the action. I watch this movie hundred time. The movie had a good action and story lines
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Excellent story and very good acting.  Totally engrousing and satisfying. One of the best action films I've seen in a long time.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|The movie was great. It had a lot of action. It had to watch that movie over and over again
039916409X|5.0|I have been using Margaret's tapping advice for years and was very excited when I heard about this book. It did not disappoint! I have only had the book for few days but already I feel a shift in my money consciousness! It is well written with lots of real life examples, always my favorite part of a book. Thank you Margaret!
B00A285OOW|5.0|Excellent book again by Phillipa, yet I read her mothers story just before so a bit to close as it resonated with the same stories. I would still read them both. Excellent reading. I would gave preferred a different rider to read them in. I live in Central America and truly enjoy every book she writes know matter what order!
B00FHSQKZ4|5.0|Very useful application. It has multiple applications. It really helps me track the time. And sound quality is surprisingly good.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|works well for what I need it for. I use it as a backup alarm to my main alarm clock.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|This IP cam does not work for me. I would not recommend it. I Would like a refund for this app.
B00DW1WR14|2.0|I've always held Pearl Jam in high regards and look forward to every release with great enthusiasm.  The band has an amazing body of work; however, I believe the band's (at least as a whole) creative peak was somewhere in the era of Vitalogy, Vs., No Code and Yield.  Don't get me wrong, Binaural and Riot Act have some amazing songs, but I just have to comment that the last several albums, Peal Jam and Backspacer in particular, have been weak.  I realize that this cannot be the same band as they were in the 90s.  I don't expect them to be.  The songs just really haven't clicked and my high expectations for Lightning Bolt were deflated after several listens.  The band seems in fine form and Eddie sounds as good as ever.  It's the songs, not the performance.  I just simply think these are not that strong a batch of tunes.  I'm having difficulty understand why this album is getting so many rave press reviews.  To each their own ears, I suppose.<br /><br />\\"Let the Records Play\\" chorus sounds exactly like a rock song by Boston or REO Speedwagon or some 80s band.  Can't quite pin it.  Does anyone else hear that?<br /><br />On a positive note, the three songs on this album that I do like are the mid-tempo reflective-rock songs \\"Sirens\\", \\"Yellow Moon\\" and \\"Future Days\\".  These are all numbers that seem like they would also fit well on a Eddie Vedder solo album.<br /><br />Looking forward to catching them on tour and seeing how these songs might develop.
0988262592|5.0|Our team had the oppotunity to meet the author today.  Not only is the book a great read he is such a nice guy.  Great insight as to why he wrote the book.  Thank you again for sharing time with us today.<br /><br />Raffaele
0345548981|5.0|... of him and  of his  diet and lifestyle.  even if we weren't, we would think this is  a very interesting book.  If  you wonder  how  a top professional athlete who needs to keep  in competition shape almost 365 days a year does it, read this book!.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Level 3 was a bit confusing to start. Thought I had to purchase the 'toys' that unlock characters, but it turns out I was not pressing the correct button. . . Fantastic game. Worth every penny. I have joined 'The Pork Side'.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|I bought this for use in my wife's classroom.  It is much less expensive than many of the alternatives, but does a good job capturing papers, etc. that she wants to display using the projector.  We have no complaints.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great book but at times really disturbing to read... Was so easy to see inside the minds of these characters. Ending was a bit disappointing to me... Left me hanging. I want to know more about how this end up... Sequel ??!!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I think this is a fun game for 10 and up. There is blood and death. This game should not be played by 5 or 4 year old children.
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|Mail online is good, but won't return to place you depart from to read expanded item.  Goes to beginning or startup place.  If that is fixed, it would be terrific.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|I saw PJ in Springfield MA with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Smashing Pumpkins on a Sunday night - never appreciating what was really in front of me. I now want to see them again after this album! I'm on the third consecutive listen and I only want to stop so I don't go through it too quick. I really don't care what the critics say - I know what I like and this an excellent composition by a band that's done things their way since 1990.oh God, I think I'm going to end up with a turntable.
B00FVS4EUI|1.0|My wife and I wanted to watch the new season of The Walking Dead, season four, episode one. We pulled up our Amazon account on our smart TV. As we looked at our choices to view, the regular download was $1.99 and the HD was $2.99. As we downloaded the HD version, it took a few minutes to start. After running for about two minutes, the screen froze and that gold circle appeared in the center of the screen. After a two minute wait, the episode would continue. This went on and on for the entire episode. It took us over an hour and a half to watch, what a joke! Save your money, don't buy the HD version of this or any other HD download.
B00028HBKM|3.0|Finally, after nine years, I decided to watch this movie. Granted, it was free for the viewing on You Tube but I'm broke so sue me. I kept away from this movie for a number of reasons among them being a possible outbreak of anti-Semitism.<br /><br />First, this was a horrifying movie. It was difficult to deal with on a mental and visceral level. To overuse an unpleasant turn of phrase: it was awash in gore. (To the credit of the NT authors none of them go into the kind of gory detail that Mel Gibson does) That said, the horror is faithful to the reality of the sufferings of Jesus Christ. Anyone who has read descriptions of the horrific wounds on the Man of the Turin Shroud (whether it's Jesus or not) knows the movie is a faithful depiction. I'm glad I did not have to be there to witness and deal with the real thing.<br /><br />Kudos to Mel for avoiding English in favor of Aramaic (Hebrew was the language of the scholars not the common man) and Latin. I listened closely for Greek but did not discern any. Throwing in some Greek would have been historically correct as well because all three languages were current in that part of the world. Employing the real languages spoken, and meticulously researching the correct pronunciation of those tongues is a big plus in my ledger.<br /><br />The very sparse use of Jewish actors (if any at all were used) is a minus. However, given the Christian track record for killing Jews (it used to be a quaint Christian custom to rush out of Church on Easter morning to visit mayhem and even murder on the hapless local Jewish population) I understand and agree with the use of Gentiles rather than Jews.<br /><br />I did like the scene in Gethsemane where Kephas (Peter) goes ape**** on the soldiers sent to arrest Jesus. Nothing beats a berserker as the Vikings would one day show the world. I loved the inclusion of the scene in which Jesus reattached the ear of astonished Malchus.<br /><br />I did notice in the scene where the crowd was shouting for Jesus to be crucified that Mel did not translate the roar of the crowd &#34;His blood be upon us and upon our children!&#34; Even a rabid anti-Semite like Mel has his moments of clarity and for that we do indeed give thanks. Crowds were worked up enough over this film without giving them seeming Divine Sanction to go out and roll some Jews. I also noticed that several times Mel drove home the point that in both Latin and Aramaic the word for Jew is, roughly and approximately, Judas.<br /><br />Filming the Gospel accounts of the sufferings along the Via Dolorosa, Jesus was depicted as carrying his own cross (with crux), and then a man from the crowd was forced to carry another crux. Was he one of the malefactors with whom Jesus was crucified? Or Simon of Cyrene? This was puzzling especially when another man (Simon of Cyrene?) was forced to help Jesus carry his Cross all the way to Golgotha. The man carrying the other crux did not reappear unless he was one of the malefactors crucified with Christ. Confusing.<br /><br />Hey! Mel even worked in the Roman Catholic legend of the cloth of Veronica (One of the few actual Jewish actors, I think) upon which Jesus supposedly wiped his bloody face and left an imprint of his bloody visage. Mel, being a western Christian of the Roman variety, could not resist indulging in a little anthropomorphizing. In the scene where Jesus dies we are looking down from a great height. The scene is blurry, as if one is looking at the scene through water. Not surprisingly, one is. A single drop of water (a tear from God's eye...you understand when you see the movie) falls to the ground and an earthquake ensues. Rather than merely the veil of the temple being torn in two the temple itself is torn in two by the earthquake. Hollywood always has to be inaccurate. They would dry up and blow away if they had to stick to the facts. Hmm. Maybe we could pass a law...  ;-)<br /><br />Did I enjoy the movie? Ask me if I would enjoy witnessing the actual scourging and sufferings of Jesus. The answer is NO! NO other movie has gone so far beyond the NT into the gory reality as this movie has. I have a strong stomach and the sight and smell of blood, even of rotten flesh, does not faze me as it does others. I was somewhat fazed by this movie. I think it is as close to the ugly reality as we can get. :-()<br /><br />Oh, a final historical note. Mel really twisted the heel of his shoe in by making sure that Caiaphas, several times, used the Aramaic word for Caesar: Kaiser. Jah, der same pronunciation as der Deutsche! Kaiser! Did Mel include it to remind the viewer that one day the Germans would murder six million Jews under the leadership of Adolph Hitler (who himself was an avid student of Martin Luther who was a rabid anti-Semite and preached the extermination of the Jews) who used the &#34;Christ killer&#34; epithet to truly horrifying effect? Only Mel and his hairdresser know for sure.  :-D<br /><br />One thumb up and one thumb down for Mels' morbid movie. :-/

0887431461|5.0|I like this book because my daughter is doing all of these things in school right now so she's getting extra practice at home with this book.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|What a fantastic album Paul has created here!! I love every song on it, and the more i listen to it, the more i like it. I love it when new material is released from former Beatles, or something we haven't heard by the Beatles! One thing for sure, you know you're not going to waste your money, and you're going to get quality at it's finest!! These songs all blend so well together..i couldn't wait for this to come out, was so excited...and believe me, this is definitely worth the wait. I hope this album gets the  recognition it deserves because i can't say enough how fantastic it is. The last Paul McCartney album i liked as well as this is \\"Flaming Pie\\"...this sort of has that feel to it, yet fresher! So buy it...you won't be disappointed. Way to go Paul!! and your wonderful band!! I'm so happy to see that this album is getting a lot of good reviews. IMO, the not so good reviews have not listened to this enough. Some of his best writing and singing in years!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Witty, easy to read, a true page turner.  Kept me up all night till l finished, bawling of course.  I'm a 27 year old male and this book destroyed me in the best possible way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like so much this game because is very very funny and i love that game.<br />This game is very good for childrens
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|Yet another great figure by Mezco Toys.... Amazing details and looks nice on your shelf... but please note that this is a still figure with no articulations so it doesn't move.... the gun is built in with the hand and can't be removed... you can only remove the glasses and the hat... you can remove or add the meth bag or the money bag, but the gun must stay at all time... one more thing I think mine came open from the bottom and taped back, but nothing was missing I guess, so if you really love Breaking Bad and figures just get it if you don't care about the box
B007MNV5WU|5.0|The game is awesome the best in the series. Nothing bad except could use more levels.Like I said awesome game.<br /><br /> -Steven-
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|I just love Funko POP figures. They look great on your shelf with nice cute details... I recommend you get this if you love Funko POP figures or Minions
B0058N2T3K|4.0|nightmare on elm street r good movies ive enjoyed them. 1, 3 were the best, very dark and good to watch in the dark.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|Jennifer Hudson has an amazing voice.  I have listened to this cd over and over and over.  I especially love &#34;Spotlight&#34;  the words and music stay in my head long after I've stopped listening to the song.  There are several songs on this cd that I like.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Amazing show!!  Definitely worth the money to buy and own this.  Need to watch the 1st season before this one to get the complete picture.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|This app has the most accurate weather report out of all the weather apps I have tried.  Adding a 24 hour  by hour report would be a welcome fix.  I would also like to see a current humidity report.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is fun and easy to find out the answers on the game i i absolutely love this game so GET IT
B005XR3K5M|5.0|As some of the comments say, they're quite thin so more of a collectable - which is exactly what I wanted them for anyway so I'm completely satisfied with the product.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Again another wonderful book by the master Stephen King. Undoubtedly the best sequel I have ever read!!<br />Now to wonder if there will be a book on what happened to<br />Abra as a grown up...
B009GFEOY8|5.0|I love the film VERY easy to use and shipped very fast. The film was just what i was looking for and a god price $$$$$$
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that this literally cool. When I first got it I thought it was gonna be wack cuz of it picture but it so fun when I bored this is like the game I come back to!!!!:)
B009X01ELC|4.0|I really like this case, however, it is somewhat heavy and very thick. The ability to stand the case up in landscape or portrait is awesome! It offers good protection and the sleep / wake feature works great with the case.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun. I recommend this to everyone out in the big bad world. So much fun. I play it every single day. Thanx for reading me review. Bye.
B0037EAJAC|1.0|The movie was only notable for the bright colors of the actors costumes.  When young people pay old people parts it seems to fall on its head and this does.  Plot is lame.
B001MSMULG|3.0|Always on the outlook for a good series and looked forward to getting caught up in this based on the reviews. Maybe it's a setup novel with better things to come but i was left underwhelmed by the main character. I know Reachers and Joe Pikes can be cartoonish, but an impeccably trained assasin who's just not into his job and in the end doesn't seem that good at it left a little to be desired...
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|As usual Leonardo gives a great performance but the movie really drug along, just couldn't keep my interest, kept dozing off.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I was looking for something distracting and immersive and this fit the bill nicely. Good guy villains with their own code of honor and chosen families naviagte the underbelly of this future or parallel feudal world. Not perfect, but I was totally willing to overlook some small flaws. i immediatelt bought the second book on Kindle and am hoping it won't take the author another 5 years to write the 4th installment now that I'm hooked.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Very well done and keeps you awake to see what happens next.  Great performances, highly recommend it to everyone of all ages.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Just a nice grown up movie with people with serious but real issues. I didn't read the book so i came to the movie cold and I'm happy with the story line and the acting especially. Saw it with some mature teens a few other adults and all enjoyed it.
B001N9ESQ4|1.0|The most boring movie I have ever seen, kept waiting for it to get better but it seemed to get worse as it went along.  Save your money on this one.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I love everything about this documentary. What else can I say.  I gave this to my niece for her 17th birthday who is a huge Foo Fighters fan and she absolutely love it.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I personally love this game it can be hard at some points I'm not to good at getting the fork out but I still love the challenge. This game may not be for every body but this a cartoon it does not say any thing wrong. If you have a kindle fire HD you for sure can keep the plane up just blow in the speaker.
0345803493|5.0|I actually loved all 3 books..I wanted to see what everyone was talking about so I read the first book...and loved it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|In his book, Hazel calls &#34;An Imperial Affliction&#34; not another cancer story. I can say that is true for this book as well. Believe me I know cancer books. When I was 13, I read many of the books by Lurene McDaniel and I think she might have invented the cancer story. But this book, she didn't just find out that she has cancer, she has been terminally I'll since she was 13. Her boyfriend doesn't heroically live on, he dies before she does. The characters get angry and sad, but they have many great times too. I read this and I honestly think that I am inside her head and she becomes a real person for me, not just thoughts on a page.
B0061S073A|5.0|love using this app.its so customizable. keeps my son from getting into my settings. I have one app to select for him to get to all of his games.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|This is the first PJ album since Yield that I didn't skip a track for the first 8 tracks. I'm not feeling \\"Let the Records Play\\" at the moment but it might win me over down the road just like \\"Of the Girl\\" from Binaural did.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Getaway,\\" is their best opener since \\"Breakerfall\\" from Binaural. My Father's Son, the title track, \\"Lightning Bolt,\\" Infallible, Pendulum are all solid songs I've listened to repeatedly so far. The second single, \\"Sirens,\\" is neither a hit or a miss, it's an enjoyable track but occasionally I'll skip it.<br /><br />Lightning Bolt is their best album since Binaural, which was a good record but wasn't great. The second-half of Binaural didn't really do it for me; it kept the record from being a 5-star album. I'm having similar feelings for Lightning Bolt- great first half, but mediocre second half.<br /><br />Even though Pearl Jam is my favorite, I'm willing to express my honest feelings about their music without bias. I love everything they did in the 90's, from Ten to Yield. I can listen to each of those 5 album start to finish without skipping a track. That stopped at Binaural, which was good, not great as their previous 5. The 2006 self-titled album, AKA Avocado, was mediocre at best, while 2003's Riot Act and 2009's Backspacer were terrible records in my opinion. I still haven't been able to get used to them or liking them.<br /><br />It's really hard to make great albums after great albums for 20+ years, but with Lightning Bolt, Pearl Jam has truly stood the test of time and this record is their true comeback album. Not the self-titled one or Backspacer. I think Lightning Bolt will be one of PJ die-hard fans favorite records in a few years. Will it be remembered along the same category as Ten, Vs or Vitalogy. Of course, not. But I think it will make it's way into the same stature as No Code, Yield and Binaural, all of which are beloved by their die-hard fans.
B0092EE5HY|3.0|this is sci-fi. fantasy appears to be Martin's forte. the characters are just not likeable. the story idea was good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so addictive I mean every time I play it I can't put it down and it's not like that all the time with me .......so.....Y'ALL SHOULD GET IT!! Byyye
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|the whole 10 book series is insane. excellent action and battle scenes and some great characters. some not really necessary bit players adding to a massive 'cast', can be confusing. I already had a complete hardback set but it's too heavy to hold so I bought the Kindles too. I've now read it thru 3 times and I plan to read it again in the future.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I liked it. It has great promise for the books to come. Feel it was getting you used to the characters and their roles in the story..
B007U4DIM6|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas she adores it- very happy with it ! Thank you so much !!
B002ZG994U|5.0|I loved this on TV, and now I can watch it any time I want to!  It's an adventure without being taken too seriously.  I like that.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I sat and watched this movie and to my surprise I never left it till it was over.<br />It was such a good movie that I would recommend it to all.
B00F2NOPFG|5.0|It is an interesting SciFi movie.  It's a fun to get into space with star ships. It's a fun to win, I felt, a battle with Kirk.<br />But there are more.  Because it is the parallel world to the original Star Trek, it is a fun to find scenes that are brought in.  It is another fun to remember the original scenes.  It is interesting to know the differences between this new Star Trek world and the original world.<br />It's so interesting that I started to read the book The Hidden Reality, which tells the theoretical possiblity of the parallel worlds.<br />Could the Star Trek world be real?
630542845X|5.0|A good movie of bullying and just plain mean people over someone who is different, not like others. But a young man who is clearly intelligent, and caring.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A good workout for your brain! Enjoy a good challenge. I could do these all day long. It really makes you think. Would be glad to see more of these.
B00008L3U1|5.0|Another funny Robin Williams movie. I am a big fan of his, just about every one of his movies can put a smile on my face. Bill Cosby is also funny in his small roll in this film.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book! Plenty scary!! Stephen king is brilliant to bring this character back as an adult. It was a real page turner, only bummer is the book is done!
630471193X|5.0|John Travolta a man who is sick, but unaware. Doing amazing things he never even dreamed of. A heartfelt movie. One that can put you into perspective of what people can do if they really put their minds to it.

B000F8O2OM|5.0|The show continues to expand the universe that was introduced in the film.<br />The characters really start to develop and the new destinations get more interesting.<br /><br />Enjoy! :D
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app has been the best game I ever played on my kindle. I love the different suits you can get. Makes playing it more fun. To me getting money is always easy. That makes getting different suits and jetpacks easy to get.
B000F8O2PG|5.0|I'll be honest... I never got into this show until it was well into its 4th or 5th season and on another network.  I simply dismissed the series thinking that it could never work because it recast the characters. Having said that, its an awesome show that carries on the Stargate mythos better than a film series could have done. I loved that they added a bit of humour to the O'Neil character which is vastly different from the film version.   What I love especially about the series is how they expand the universe that was somewhat touched upon in the film but never really addressed. If you've never seen the series, pick up the first 3 seasons and get a taste for it...  Its a great show for sci-fi fans and people who enjoy great chemistry between actors.  :D
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy the challenge to complete each session as fast as I can.  It can improve your attention span and concentration.
B002DMJLTE|3.0|Armageddon and Deep Impact came out around the same time.<br />One is about an asteroid and this one is about a comet.<br />Very similar flicks with similar results.<br />The visual effects were quite decent for its time.<br />It looks alright on Blu-ray but nothing epic.<br /><br />Enjoy
B00000IL26|5.0|As Bob Blumenthal describes in his \\"New Look at The Sidewinder,\\" this album was a comeback for Lee Morgan after two years of struggling with addiction.  Fortunately Alfred Lion gave the trumpeter another shot, and the result was not just the hit title track but a fine overall session as well as Morgan's many subsequent Blue Note albums.  All of the tunes here are Morgan's own, and they share a level of rhythmic interest and unusual melodic turns that raise them well above the ordinary.  The Latin-flavored \\"Totem Pole\\" stands out, along with the hard bop swing of \\"Boy, What a Night,\\" where the final tempo and meter were worked out during the session.  Morgan and tenor Joe Henderson obviously hit it off - this was the first time they played together, and they really cook.  Pianist Barry Harris and bass Bob Cranshaw had played with Lee on the one album Morgan made during his two year plunge into obscurity, \\"Take Twelve\\" for the Jazzland label in January 1962.<br /><br />I am surprised that no other reviewer has mentioned Bob Cranshaw's fascinating recollections of this session (they can be found on YouTube).  Though Morgan brought in the music for the tunes, the title track was not among the charts.  They recorded the other four pieces and found they needed one more tune to complete the album.  At that point Morgan disappeared into the bathroom.  Ten minutes passed, then fifteen, and Cranshaw, who knew of Morgan's recent recovery, was a bit worried.  Finally Lee reappeared and handed out the music that became \\"The Sidewinder.\\"  Cranshaw remembered that Harris, who was more of a straight bop artist, said, \\"Man, I'm going to play it as funky as I can.\\"<br /><br />Lee told Cranshaw to play a pickup before the tune, so Cranshaw came up with his little descending bass figure (do-do-do-doo).  Off they went, eventually it was Cranshaw's turn to solo, the groove still cranking away, and they reached the point to take the tune out.  At about 8:40 Cranshaw ended his solo, pausing on a blue note (sorry, couldn't resist), and he then collapsed in laughter because he couldn't remember his own pickup figure!  Everyone stopped and Rudy Van Gelder ran the tape back so Cranshaw could hear what he played at the beginning.  Then they recorded the out chorus and Rudy spliced it into the master.  It's a great story, and underlines just how accidental the origins of a hit can be.  BTW, despite the many references to \\"sinuous serpent\\" and the like in reviews, Morgan named the tune because it reminded him of \\"the sidewinder - you know, the bad guy on television.\\"
B00AEFY3DQ|4.0|You can't go wrong with Galaxy Quest...<br />Sigourney as a blonde!<br />Sam Rockwell being.... well weird.<br />Tim Allen's last breath as a worthy and engaging persona on screen.<br />oh and that Mac guy before he tried to be too sexy.<br /><br />Fun concept, fun cast and pretty cool special effects work.<br /><br />Pick it up... or not! :D
B008JFUO4U|3.0|This was a visually beautiful movie but confusing for me. I never quite figured out exactly what was happening and why.<br />Still it's worth renting if not buying.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|Willow is fun for its nostalgia, the wonderful world before CGI dominated films... not that I am complaining.<br />Wonderful to see the deleted scenes and how they would have fit into the film... the missing acorn.<br />I think Willow needs to be revisited on the big screen once more... Warwick is still alive and looks pretty much similar to what he looked like in this film.<br />I could totally see a story with the return of Bavmorda... she is still alive and kicking. If Betty White can have a later in life success story, so can Jean!<br />I could also see a continuation of story featuring an older Elora Danann and how she is facing her reign. Although I would not follow the books that were produced shortly after Willow came out.<br /><br />:D
B000JMKTLO|4.0|After reading Gone Girl, I wanted to give Gillian Flynn's other books a shot. This isn't as good as Gone Girl but still a great novel. I enjoy her writing and the darkness of her novels. I look forward to reading more.
098478280X|3.0|As mentioned in the subject/title, earlier editions of this book are available online for free. I am not sure there is a huge amount of difference between editions, to be honest.<br /><br />That said, this book is a great practice tool ahead of a technical interview. It has some introduction that helps (maybe?) calm nerves of those who have never interviewed for a software engineer position at one of the big companies (like Amazon!), a section about behavioral questions you should be prepared for (the only thing you can really have perfectly rehearsed responses for, so you better nail them), and most of the book is divided into topics with some brief overview (seriously, just touching the surface) and questions. You should PRACTICE ON A WHITEBOARD. I think the book recommends that, too. Sample solutions are available in the back of the book, but not always alternate solutions (yes, there are alternate solutions).<br /><br />Many practice questions structured in a way where you should expect to come up with some easier but less optimized &#34;brute force&#34; or obvious solution and then discuss the problems with it and then come up with a more interesting and optimized solution. What makes this difficult is that interview questions are designed to require the interviewee to ask a lot of questions to clear up ambiguities, and going through this book solo while not looking at solutions unless you are really stuck is a challenge when you need to see what assumptions the book's answer are going with. If you peek, though, only look as far as you need to get going on your own; it will *not* help you if you just look a the solutions. Doing these with a (knowledgeable) friend will help that temptation to look at the solutions. You should really do mock interviews anyway (though I didn't).<br /><br />That said, the fact that his book is published and has been out in varying editions for how long now? means that most of the questions in this book have probably been banned because they don't want to ask you questions you have already solved. They want to see your process for solving problems. So this book will only offer you practice, and possibly patterns, but do not expect to be able to do (and remember) all the problems and be set for the interview. Did I get asked any problems from this book? Yes, I got asked one, with a twist, but I didn't fully remember the solution so I had to work through it anyway (which is good; they will know if you already know the answer). Most questions I got I had never seen before, but the patterns I picked up from going through this book helped me.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this as one of many practice platforms. Get practice in. There are more resources available for free on the internet. Will this guarantee you will be able to crack the coding interview? No. But it is a start and doing the practice problems will definitely help you. Interviews at the top tech companies are not easy no matter how much prep you do, though, sorry! (And if you read people boasting how easy their interview was but then sour grapes about not getting an offer, it was either not a culture fit or the fact that they thought it was easy means they had no idea what they were doing.)
031623480X|1.0|Update(s):<br /><br />February 2014: Because your brain has a lot of fat, Perlmutter wants you to eat more cholesterol and fat.  But that's how you get diabetes, which may lead to Alzheimer's!  A recent study that induced diabetes in rats by giving them a high fat diet showed that the diabetic rats had weaker memories than the healthy ones (read all the details in the the article: \\"Are Alzheimer's and diabetes the same disease?\\" 28 November 2013 by Jessica Griggs. NewScientist)<br /><br />December 2013: The Atlantic Monthly has just published an article about this book called \\"This Is Your Brain on Gluten\\" by James Hamblin. Below are some excerpts:<br /><br />1) \\"In the Paleolithic Era, human life expectancy was around 30 years... humans did not live past their 50s. I wonder often why these are the times we cite as a standard of health. The paucity of old age should in itself explain why Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease were basically nonexistent\\"<br /><br />2) Dr. David Katz is an epidemiologist who has published two editions of a nutrition textbook for healthcare professionals called Nutrition in Clinical Practice. Perlmutter estimates the Stone Age diet was 75% fat, a claim Dr. Katz finds \\"wildly preposterous. Anthropological research... suggests that in the age before cooking oil, humans ate mostly plants with a scattering of seeds and nuts. Virtually nothing in the natural world is that concentrated of a fat source, except maybe for the brain. Maybe if they just ate the brains of animals? They didn't have oil. They only started adding oil to the diet after the Dawn of Agriculture. What the hell could they possibly have eaten that would be that fatty?'\\"<br /><br />I have an excellent example of how absurd Perlmutter is to say our diet used to be 75% fat. In the amazing chronicle of Lewis and Clark [[ASIN:0684826976 Undaunted Courage:  Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West]], venison and elk meat was so lean (per 3.5 ounces: 4% fat, versus 35% fat in beef), that even though each expedition member ate up to 9 pounds of meat a day,...they were still hungry (p 165). Later in the book, Lewis remarks \\"that he didn't care what kind of meat he got, whether elk or dog or horse or wolf, so long as it was fat\\".  Sacagawea brought the men some roots to eat which was a welcome addition to \\"the virtually all-meat diet...which if not complemented by other food might lead to scurvy, ... the men of the expedition at various times did suffer from scurvy. It was an age in which almost nothing was known about a balanced diet.\\"  A diet that sounds a lot like what Perlmutter is recommending!<br /><br />3) Dr Katz goes on to say that Perlmutter's \\"book is filled with a whole bunch of nonsense, that's why it's a bestseller. ...That's how you get on the bestseller list. You promise the moon and stars, you say everything you heard before was wrong, and you blame everything on one thing. You get a scapegoat; it's classic. Atkins made a fortune with that formula. we now have Perlmutter saying it's all grain. There's either a scapegoat or a silver bullet in almost every bestselling diet book. The recurring formula is: Tell readers it's not their fault. Blame an agency; typically the pharmaceutical industry or U.S. government, but also possibly the medical establishment. Offer a simple solution. Cite science and mainstream research when applicable; demonize it when it is not.<br /><br />Dr. Katz gives Perlmutter too much credit for the few scientific citations he has -- if he had read the papers cited (I read all of the original papers), he would have discovered that they do NOT support Perlmutter's claims about whole grains and dementia (which is what my review below focuses on since it would take a book to refute every piece of nonsense -- See #10 below).<br /><br />4) Perlmutter's advice is POTENTIALLY LETHAL.  Hamblin asks: \\"What is the worst that can come of avoiding gluten and limiting carbs?  That dependsentirely on what you replace those calories with. I read the book with an eye for the most dangerous claim. What stuck out to me was Perlmutter's case for cholesterol. He basically says that we can't have too much. Beyond that, Perlmutter says that cholesterol-lowering statin medicines like Lipitor, which are prescribed for a quarter of Americans over 40, should actually be vehemently avoided. Cholesterol is necessary for the brain in high levels, he says, and lowering it is contributing to dementia. Dr. Katz replies: \\"..can we totally ignore both dietary cholesterol and LDL? Absolutely not...Ignoring LDL could absolutely result in heart attacks and strokes\\".  Katz acknowledges that dietary cholesterol may be an innocuous part of an overall healthy diet. \\"The problem is that people are going to get their dietary cholesterol from things other than fish and eggs; they're going to get it from meats and dairies. The problem with diets like that is if you eat more of A, you're probably going to eat less of B. So people who are eating more meat and dairy and high-fat, high-cholesterol foods are eating fewer plants--they're not eating beans; they're not eating lentils. So yes, I think it's entirely confabulated and contrived, and potentially dangerous on the level of lethal.\\"<br /><br />5) \\"We do not have reason to believe that gluten is bad for most people. It does cause reactive symptoms in some people. Peanuts can kill some people, but that does not mean they are bad for everyone. Diets consistently shown to have good long-term health outcomes---both mental and physical--include whole grains and fruits, and are not nearly as high in fat as what Perlmutter proposes. I hope people don't give up on nutrition science, because there is a sense that no one agrees on anything. An outlier comes shouting along every year with a new diet bent on changing our entire perspective, and it's all the talk. That can leave us with a sense that no one is to be believed. When a person [like Perlmutter] advocates radical change on the order of eliminating one of the three main food groups from our diets, the burden of proof should be enormous. Everything you know is not wrong.\\"<br /><br />----------------------------<br /><br />And now here is my review:<br /><br />The blurb for this book reads: \\"carbs are destroying your brain. And not just unhealthy carbs, but even healthy ones like WHOLE GRAINS can cause dementia, ADHD, anxiety, chronic headaches, depression, and much more\\".<br /><br />Wow!  This is such an incredible claim, and there is not one shred of evidence in the book to back it up. Here are some of the reasons why:<br /><br />#1: Mediterranean & DASH diets both recommend whole grains<br /><br />These diets have lots of carbohydrates and LOWER dementia, blood pressure, cancer, strokes, heart attacks, and so on.<br /><br />People eating a Mediterranean diet are among the longest-lived on earth and they've been studied for decades.  Italy has the 4th longest lifespan in the world!<br /><br />U.S. News and World report has a fantastic overview and details of the best diets (and worst). The DASH and Mediterranean diets were considered to be the best diets by experts across many fields  There were 22 experts - mainly physicians and professors of food science and nutrition, who evaluated and ranked a variety of diet plans based on: how easy to follow, ability to produce short and long-term weight loss, nutritional completeness, safety, and prevent diabetes and heart disease.  The Paleo diet came in dead last.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#2 If whole grains or carbohydrates caused any of these maladies, it would be headline news on Time magazine, medical journals, the New York Times,  and TV news.<br /><br />But it isn't.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#3 Grains have been the basis of civilization for over 10,000 years. We evolved to eat grain. So did dogs.  Two-thirds of people onthe planet depend on grains to get enough calories.<br /><br />Our genetics have even changed to adapt to this -- anyone with ancestors from a farming region has up to 7 times as many amylase genes to digest starch as a hunter-gatherer.  Read [[ASIN:0465020429 The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution]] to learn more about how we evolved faster the past 10,000 years than the previous 6 million years to adapt to the new agricultural diet (and milk, etc).<br /><br />One of the top peer-reviewed science journals in the world, Science Magazine, has an article titled \\"Diet Shaped Dog Domestication\\" published 23 January 2013.  DNA from wolves and dogs was obtained, and the most surprising difference between wolves and dogs was that dogs were highly evolved to digest starch, with 4 to 30 copies of the amylase gene, which breaks down starch in the intestine. Wolves only have 2 copies, which means amylase genes in dogs are 28 times as active than in wolves, making dogs 5 times better at digesting starch than wolves.  The same is true of people - Europeans, Americans, Japanese and other cultures that eat a lot of grains have much higher numbers of copies of amylase genes than people who eat starch-poor diets like the Mbuti in Africa.<br /><br />\\"We have adapted in a very similar way to the dramatic changes that happened when agriculture was developed,\\" concluded evolutionary geneticist Erik at Uppsala University in Sweden.<br /><br />\\"Axelsson thinks these results support the idea that wolves began to associate with humans who were beginning to settle down and farm. Waste dumps provided a ready source of food, albeit not meat, the usual diet. Thus early dogs that evolved more efficient starch digestion had an advantage\\".<br /><br />I thought a paleo diet made sense many years ago, and was both surprised and delighted to discover we'd evolved to eat grains and legumes in mere millenia.  Grains and legumes are the basis of civilization and always will be, since grains don't need refrigeration and can last past several bad harvests.  The Buddha said to avoid attachment, and this applies not just to things but ideas.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#4 Before agriculture, most cultures, even Native Americans, ate lots of carbohydrates.<br /><br />In California, half the diet of most hunter-gatherer tribes was acorns. Tribes across America depended heavily on acorns, as well as tribes across the Eurasian continent.  Acorns are 43% carbohydrate. Whole wheat is 68% carbohydrate - but grains and lentils are only a quarter of the food plate, while Native Americans were depending on them for half of their diet.  So it's 6 of one, half a dozen of the other.<br /><br />Bits of starch grains have been found on the grinding stones from 30,000 year old sites in Italy, Russia, and the Czech Republic, where our ancestors made flour from ground up plants, combined it with water and made a pita bread on stones heated in fires.  Our ancestors were smart to grind roots so the flour could be stored or carried, since often game animals were seasonal and no meat was to be had many times of the year.<br /><br />Eating carbohydrates could go back for millions of years.  Fossil hominids had such sturdy premolar teeth it's believed they were probably used to open seeds and chew starchy underground tubers and bulbs. Even Neanderthals ate starch, which we know from studying the plaque on their teeth.<br /><br />Anthropologist Frank Marlowe studied the eating patterns of 478 groups around the globe. He found that no matter where you live, at least a third of your diet is going to come from plants (and in many places nearly all of your diet), so the idea our ancestors were mainly carnivorous is not true.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#5 We already know what the causes of dementia and Alzheimer's are from tens of thousands of studies.  Carbohydrates have nothing to do with it.<br /><br />The risks are:  Being over 65, genetic (5%), female (women live longer), severe or repeated head trauma, lack of exercise, smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, poorly controlled diabetes, not enough fruits & vegetables, lack of social engagement<br /><br />People at a lower risk have higher levels of formal education, a stimulating job, mentally challenging hobbies like reading or playing a musical instrument, and lots of social interactions.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#6 Thousands of studies over 50 years that show whole grains can reduce your risk of stroke by up to 36%, heart disease by up to 28%, and type 2 diabetes up to 30%<br /><br />The March 2008 issue of Consumer Reports says that eating whole grains is the #1 action you can take to improve your health (besides quitting smoking).<br /><br />According to the World Health Organization Global Burden of disease 2010 study, the 16th leading cause of early death and disability is not eating enough whole grains (The Lancet).<br /><br />Whole grains also appear to lessen or lower the risk of: Artery-narrowing plaque, Asthma, Atherosclerosis, Blood pressure,  Cancer: Bladder, Breast, Colon, Esophagus, Gallbladder, Kidney, Liver, Larynx, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Ovarian, Pancreatic,  Prostate,  Rectal, Stomach; C-reactive protein, lower LDL Cholesterol and triglycerides, Constipation, Diabetes, Diverticulitis, Gallstones, Gastrointestinal disorders, Gum disease, Hemorrhoids, Hypertension, Inflammatory diseases, Macular degeneration, Metabolic syndrome, Obesity, Varicose veins of the legs, Weight regulation (loss), lower BMI, and increase your life span (wholegraincouncil).<br /><br />In 2010, the American Society for Nutrition brought researchers together to review the evidence of whole grain health benefits. Current scientific evidence shows that whole grains play an important role in lowering the risk of chronic diseases like coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, and also contribute to body weight management and gastrointestinal health. The findings were published as a supplement to The Journal of Nutrition in May 2011<br /><br />In 2004 (Nutrition Research Reviews, May 2004; Vol 17: 99-110), Dr. Joanne Slavin of the University of Minnesota published a comprehensive article that reviewed and compiled scores of recent studies on whole grains and health, to show how whole-grain intake is protective against cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity.<br /><br />The wholegrainscouncil has thousands of studies listed at their \\"health studies on whole grains\\" and \\"What are the health benefits\\" pages. If you think the wholegrainscouncil is a biased institution then you need to counter with peer-reviewed scientific evidence, not name-calling.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#7 Did Perlmutter single-handedly disprove decades of peer-reviewed studies in both medicine and nutrition?<br /><br />I can't find any reference(s) in his book to support his claims.  Nor did the the New York Times, the 2 top scientific magazines Science and Nature, NBC, ABC, CBS, The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine, the Mayo Clinic, or any other medical or science journal.<br /><br />There are very few 2013 references.  Many of those are non-science references (i.e. Dr. Oz, cookbook author Mark Bittman - my favorite cookbook author, but the citation is not a peer-reviewed study) and most of  his scientific references that have anything to do with wheat are for people with celiac disease (1-2% of the population) or sensitive to gluten, at most 7% of people.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#8 the references that do exist only apply to the 1% with celiac disease or 5% with gluten intolerance<br /><br />So if there's a grain of truth to anything he's saying, it doesn't apply to those of us in the 90% majority.  But  I don't know if I can believe anything he's saying, and it's too much work to sort the wheat from the chaff.<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#9 Testimonials are not proof. Only peer-reviewed science in top-tier journals counts<br /><br />Most of Perlmutter's \\"proof\\" are the testimonials of patients.<br /><br />Testimonials are NOT SCIENCE --and Dr. Perlmutter MUST know this if he has an advanced degree.<br /><br />Only double blind studies that can be repeated are valid evidence. Because people forget what they've eaten, or over/under estimate what they've eaten, the reports of people in scientific studies are the least reliable, and this isn't even a scientific study, it's his patients who probably like him or they'd go to another doctor.<br /><br />The most trustworthy studies look at the diets of millions of people across nations or large groups of people over decades. Many studies of national diet and thousands of people have shown many benefits from eating whole grains for decades.<br /><br />If you want to seriously debate the merits of this book, you need to counter with peer-reviewed science, not attack my character or invent something I wrote and then rebut an argument I never made.<br /><br />I feel like I disturbed a hornet's nest of True Believers, a religious Paleo diet cult. Hey, I'm not trying to take your bacon away -- believing in bacon makes more sense than believing any of the 3,000 plus Gods you can choose from across the various main and tribal religions.<br /><br />But as Eric Schlosser showed in [[ASIN:0547750331 Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal]] there are ethical and ecological repercussions to consider. So before you fry up that next pan of bacon, you might find that [[ASIN:0803276176 Raising a Stink: The Struggle over Factory Hog Farms in Nebraska (Our Sustainable Future)]] will give you food for thought.<br /><br />Bacon, eggs, and red meat do not lead to a long life.  Quite the opposite: According to the World Health Organization's \\"Global Burden of Disease 2010″ study, American causes of early death and disability are: High total cholesterol #9, Diet high in processed meat #12, Diet high in red meat #32<br /><br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />#10 Perlmutter provides no evidence to support his idea. None.<br /><br />Perlmutter hasn't published peer-reviewed papers about anything -not in his field of neurology our outside of his field in nutrition.<br /><br />To prove his point, he often cites what he calls a Mayo clinic paper in Grain Brain, TV, radio, and internet articles. He says that \\"Relative Intake of Macronutrients Impacts Risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment or dementia\\", shows people favoring carbohydrates in their diet had an 89% increased risk of developing dementia. But those who ate the most fat had a 36% reduction in risk.<br /><br />Not true.  In this study:<br /><br />1) No one developed dementia.<br />2) Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a controversial diagnosis. It just means someone has mild problems with language, thinking, memory and judgment. Many physicians think these are normal symptoms of aging.  MCI often goes away.  Most people diagnosed with MCI do not go on to develop dementia or Alzheimer's.<br />3) The words \\"whole grain\\" or \\"whole wheat\\" do not appear in this study.  No effort was made to distinguish healthy whole grains from refined carbohydrates.<br />4) This was an observational study.  It can only show a correlation between two things, not cause-and-effect.  There could be other factors in the participants' lives that explain the results.<br />5) The subjects self-reported their dietary intake. Its well-known people aren't good at this.<br /><br />There are only 7 peer-reviewed references in Grain Brain that have anything to do with both carbohydrates and dementia.  Not one of these papers mentions whole grains or whole wheat. Two of the papers apply only to the 1% of the population with Celiac Disease.  Five of these 7 papers apply only to people with celiac disease or gluten sensitivities (at most 6 to7% of the U.S. population).<br /><br />Perlmutter says that because 70% of our brains are fat, we should be getting 50-60% of our calories from fat.  That's more than twice what the Mayo Clinic and every other expert says.  They all recommend 20-35% of total daily calories from fat, 45-65% of your daily calories from carbohydrates, and 10-35% of calories from protein (Zeratsky, Mayo Clinic Staff, U.S. Dept of Health and Human Services).<br /><br />Goodbye nutrition, hello cardiology.<br /><br />I know people are really angry that sugar and white flour may be as bad as fat, but that doesn't mean going to the other extreme and eating so much fat you'll get a heart attack.<br /><br />Perlmutter cites studies to show fat prevents dementia, but if you actually read these studies (free and available online), it backfires.  He advises not eating much fruit, yet the conclusion of one of the papers \\"Dietary Patterns and Risk of Dementia: The Three-city Cohort Study\\" concluded \\"Frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables, fish, and omega-3 rich oils may decrease the risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease\\".<br /><br />At his website [...] he cites \\"Evidence-Based Guideline of the German Nutrition Society: Carbohydrate Intake and Prevention of Nutrition-Related Diseases\\".  Oops again. Perlmutter spends a lot of time trying to show that carbohydrates (and therefore whole grains) lead to diabetes, which leads to dementia), but this paper says the opposite: \\"a high dietary fibre intake, mainly from whole-grain products, reduces the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer\\".<br /><br />--------------------------<br /><br />#11 What is Perlmutter's motivation?<br /><br />At amazon.com I have been accused of profiting somehow from my 1-star review of this book.  This is called an \\"ad hominem\\" attack because it distracts people from my 11 criticisms by not addressing anyof them. (By the way I don't work -- I'm retired, make no money from my book about home made whole grain & legume chips & crackers, and don't care if I ever do. I'm way too busy with other activities, such as volunteering to take 4th & 5th graders from the inner city on hikes at Audubon Canyon Ranch near Bolinas, blogging about nutrition and other food related topics at my website, etc. My grandfather was a nutrition professor at the University of Chicago so I've been interested in this topic for a long time.  He died before he could publish his book about the extent to which a well-fed an army was likely to win a battle. Napoleon thought good food was essential and had first-rate bakers making high-quality bread for soldiers on the front-lines).<br /><br />So these strange attacks on me rather than my arguments and accusations that I was somehow doing this to make money brought up another argument I hadn't thought of, so I went back to this review to add what's below.<br /><br />In murder mysteries the killer is often found by discovering a motivation.  Why would Perlmutter slam WHOLE GRAINS rather than white flour?  And he's not the only one doing this, which makes me all the more suspicious that the industrial food companies are funding people who speak out against whole grains.<br /><br />Why would they do that?<br /><br />The basis of processed food is using unhealthy cheap ingredients. Fat, sugar, salt and white flour are almost as cheap as water. Read my review of [[ASIN:1400069807 Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us]] at wholegrainalice.<br /><br />If there's anyone who makes money off of this, it would be the processed food industry, and they'd do it by sponsoring \\"experts\\" to slam whole grains so they can keep using cheap unhealthy white flour.  There are many ways to do this, one would be making lucrative speaking engagements on TV, radio, and conferences available to Perlmutter and other \\"experts\\" who slam whole grains.  The multi-billion dollar food industry has a very strong motive to fight whole grains because they're quite expensive compared to white flour, have a shorter shelf life, and are more trouble to predictably make \\"perfect\\" because whole wheat varies in protein and other content.<br /><br />But there are many other ways that corporations pay \\"experts\\" and also keep it a secret.  The best book on this is [[ASIN:0674047141 Bending Science: How Special Interests Corrupt Public Health Research]].  Also see  [[ASIN:1608193942 Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming]]<br /><br />Basically Perlmutter is making a claim that refutes thousands of studies of the health benefits of whole grains -- he deserves to be criticized just like those who deny climate change, evolution, or that tobacco causes cancer.<br /><br />Why didn't Perlmutter criticize white flour?<br /><br />White flour has had the bran and germ removed so it's just a starch.  It no longer behaves like flour, so up to 30 chemicals are added (many of them banned in Europe -- see my article at wholegrainalice). White flour has no fiber, up to 88% of 21 vitamins and minerals are removed (they're mostly in the missing bran & germ), and all the essential healthy oils, and most of the protein too.<br /><br />David Kessler, former head of the FDA, writes in [[ASIN:1605294578 The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite]] that more than any other product, baked goods have more sugar, salt, and fat than other products to hide these sour, bitter chemical flavors.<br /><br />I can understand that the average person is totally confused by all the advice out there and wouldn't know that testimony counts for nothing, but Dr. Perlmutter knows he can't refute decades of studies showing the benefits of whole grains. Health claims for whole grains are one of the few claims allowed by the FDA. It's how two-thirds of people in the world get enough caloriesto survive.<br /><br />So to blame dementia etc., on wheat when he knows full well that other factors are mainly to blame, now why would he do that?  Yet another way to make money off of this quack idea is obvious - to sell this book to gullible new age, Dr. Oz, Andrew Weil, gluten-free and Paleo diet followers.<br /><br />A third way to make money, in addition to corporate money and selling this book is that he's on the advisory board of the company that makes the Protandim pill he recommends taking.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />#12 Perlmutter knows other factors are to blame<br /><br />And get this -- only a very small number of his citations are about grains, the title of this book.  And only one chapter, the rest are about fats, statins, sleep, fasting, and other topics.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />The only way to protect yourself from bad ideas is to understand what bad versus good evidence is, develop critical thinking skills, and read about a topic.  If you don't know what we know and how we know it, or have a basic understanding of nutrition, then you may fall prey to any quack that sounds good to you.  Inoculate yourself by reading a nutrition textbook.  My favorite by far (and I've looked through hundreds of textbooks at the University of California library) is [[ASIN:0538733578 Nutrition for Health and Health Care]].  Get it from a university library, or buy an older edition, the basics don't change much.<br /><br />One of the comments says that wheat has a gluten content 500 times what it was in the past which \\"disturbs the digestive tract by making it more permeable and \\"leaky\\" even in people who aren't gluten-sensitive\\".  Another said they are \\"enriched\\" with chemical laden \\"nutrients\\" and it's not the same as it used to be.  Another that mutagenesis has changed the wheat somehow.  Prove these statements with peer-reviewed references, the more the better, and I'll change my mind.<br /><br />I noticed that the 3 Most Helpful Customer Reviews that appear on the main page, which few people would click past to reach this review, are written by Amazon Vine Reviewers. According to episode #492 of National Public Radio's \\"Planet Money\\", they receive the items reviewed for FREE.  This would lead to positive reviews in two different ways -- the obvious one is that we are wired as human beings to be return gifts (that's why the Hare Krishna's liked to hand out flowers at the airport), and #2 the reviewers get to pick which items they want to review out of many -- so they're going to pick books that they might be interested in.  I spent a good deal of time looking at the books and products these reviewers reviewed, and they tended to give nearly all four or five star reviews, and they write thousands of them, across thousands of not just books, but all the other products they get for free.  I wonder if maybe Amazon is picking Vine reviewers by those that highly rate most products so they can sell more books (or whatever).<br /><br />Perlmutter also buys into the Paleo diet, which has been soundly shown to be a fantasy (see my book review of [[ASIN:0393081370 Paleofantasy: What Evolution Really Tells Us about Sex, Diet, and How We Live]] )<br /><br />Here's what the Whole Grains Council had to say about this book:<br /><br />Celiac disease and gluten intolerance are real and serious issues. People with celiac disease (1-2% of the population) or non-celiac gluten intolerance (estimated at about 6% of the population) can indeed have medical issues not only with their digestive systems but with other organs including the brain, and these people will benefit from removing the four gluten grains - wheat, barley, rye and triticale - from their diets.<br /><br />Even the 7-10% of people with a reaction to gluten, however, can continue to enjoy all the non-gluten grains: amaranth, buckwheat, corn, millet, oats (if certified as non-contaminated), quinoa, rice, sorghum, teff, and wildrice. The rest of the population can enjoy these ten grains along with the four gluten grains. Leading medical researchers in the area of gluten intolerance and celiac disease attest that there is no need for 90 percent or more of our population to avoid any grains.<br /><br />Put simply, there is no evidence for the idea we should all avoid all grains. Perlmutter must realize this himself, since Grain Brain contradicts its main premise that all grains are injurious to brain health, and recommends eating, in moderation, \\"amaranth, buckwheat, rice (brown, white [sic], wild), millet, quinoa, sorghum, teff and [gluten-free] oats.\\"<br /><br />In fact, evidence for the health benefits of whole grains is well-documented at the whole grains council website - and was touted by Grain Brain's author in his earlier book The Better Brain which included foods like whole grain couscous, oatmeal, spelt pasta, and quinoa-stuffed peppers throughout its menu plans. In an interview promoting The Better Brain on CBN-TV, for instance, Perlmutter advocated replacing junk food with \\"real food such as unprocessed whole grains and fruits and vegetables.\\" He does not acknowledge or explain his flip-flop in Grain Brain, giving us no clue why he has now turned against what he previously acknowledged to be sound science.<br /><br />While Grain Brain goes off the deep end in imagining that the very real health problems of the 7-10% of the population with gluten intolerance or celiac disease somehow extend to all of us, the book rightfully details many important components of good health that Oldways and the Whole Grains Council have long supported. These include the key roles of physical activity and sleep; the essential contribution of good fats; the value of the Mediterranean Diet (which Perlmutter cites as \\"very similar to my dietary protocol\\"); and the importance of avoiding inflammation and choosing carbohydrates with a low glycemic impact.<br /><br />Our advice? Don't let Grain Brain scareyou away from appropriate-size portions of healthy forms of whole grains (yes, a whole grain cookie is still a cookie!). Enjoy a balanced diet including a delicious variety of real, whole foods, an approach followed in traditional diets backed up by proven science, like those championed by Oldways.
0385523394|4.0|I ordered this book having loved the show on Netflix, which had some level of involvement by Piper Kerman herself. While I enjoyed this book a lot and would recommend to any girl or woman, especially those who have ever attended an all-female school (high school myself), it was not much like the show.<br /><br />The show was very obviously played up to be dramatic, to great success. The book leaves something to be desired if you are hoping to read past the dramatic season 1 cliffhanger. But it is never fair to compare a book to a show or movie (it should be the other way around), so I tried to let all that go. There are definitely some of the same characters and some of the same back story, but a lot is different and overall the book is very uplifting in stark contrast to the show. You wouldn't expect a memoir of women's prison to be that way, especially after watching the show, but it was.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting and super fun! The minions are very realistic and just as cute as in the movie. Definitely one of my favorite temple-run style games :) My only complaint is that the off-center view for battles (and sometimes randomly) is slightly confusing, but still awesome! I love the complex track styles! A must-have app!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXMG|3.0|Fun movie with one weird/dodgy moment. It's kind of the most romantic part according to some people so I won't say what it is except that I think it could technically be considered assault. People are weird in what they think is romantic or not... I thought this was a good movie otherwise (Kate Hudson's character is so well-played and the plot is very well put together). Some people really love this movie and I enjoyed it but I wasn't amazed by it or anything. Well worth a watch though; you might be one of the ones who loves it and you'll never know til you see it; besides it's a part of pop culture. Just, um, don't mimic the \\"romantic\\" moment because among other things I think it's illegal in real life.
B007R9MFPU|5.0|I'm a former Tower Records employee from \\"the day\\"! Yes I was working at Tower when all of the original Ultravox material was released in the 1980's. I remember being blown away by Vienna.<br /><br />This album is truly a return to \\"the day\\". Midge Ure's powerful vocals, Chris Cross's heavy bass lines, Warren Cann's spot on percussion, Billy Currie's flowing and moving electric violin and synth work. In a word AWESOME. Nice to have you guys back....<br /><br />oh.. please please please tour the Pacific Northwest next summer.. we have the most fantastic venue at Chateau St. Michele in Woodinville. It was good enough for Crowded House! Check it out guys... PLEASE!<br /><br />[...]
0142501123|4.0|I liked this book, and it kept my child's interest.  It goes along with rhyming words and flows nicely with great illustrations.
B00D29CBIU|5.0|...if you actually do the Tapping, of course!<br />Margaret Lynch is a real Master in the field of wealth and business and this book is a must, especially for heart-centered, conscious entrepreneurs who want to Have It All: a profitable sustainable business doing what they love and making a difference in the world.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It is a lot like Harold Robbins books and not for family reading. however it has a good story to it
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|This song is upbeat, catchy and fun.  It reminds me of Country Grammar by Nelly with the typical Pitbull yell and Ke$ha lyrics!
B0089EHWQE|2.0|The author is a good writer, just a bit of a downer story line. I guess it is reality for many though.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|There has always to some extent been a grain of country in Sheryl Crow's albums. Therefore, it is no big surprise that she now chooses to promote her latest album as a country album .<br /><br />If some, for this reason in advance choose to deselect \\"Feels Like Home\\", I would suggest that they give the album a chance after all. There is really no radical style change , and a large proportion of the numbers would have fitted nicely in on some of her previous albums. Some songs are actually more rock than country. Putting all talk about genre aside, this is in fact a very solid album from Crow, to my ears her best  since \\"C'mon C'mon\\" from 2002.<br /><br />Except for two songs, which were borrowed from other writers, Crow has chosen to write her new songs in collaboration with various other songwriters, including her old partner Jeff Trott. Songwriter and music publisher Chris DuBois contributes on five songs and he is the most prolific contributor, and among these especially \\"Easy\\" stands out as one of the album's absolute highlights.<br /><br />I will also highlight the delicate \\"Homecoming Queen\\", one of the two songs that Crow did not take part in writing. Also the quiet \\" Homesick \\" is hitting the overall atmosphere of the album; the border area between country and southern rock. \\"Stay at Home Mother\\" is fine thoughtful ballad that unlike some of the other more emotional songs, does not slip into getting a little too sentimental.<br /><br />You can't help feeling that Crow on this album really feels at home  with her music .
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|A bit of a downer to say the least. Yet, through out some interesting aspects of life. Creative author though.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Excellent for traveling with a laptop and streaming movies in a hotel room. Only problem can be router or hub if the wireless connection is slow.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I just read this for the second time and enjoyed it even more, a compelling story with complex characters and an intriguing plot. I still stumbled on some of the Swedish names of the towns though. A very enjoyable read which is hard to put down.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Nice display. Easy to set up. A winner! I will probably get the pro version. I like how the display is easy on the eyes.
039916409X|5.0|It is great book thank you so much Margaret , love every tapping , I find lot if blocks that I didn't even knew they exist . Thank you
B0079R8KXG|5.0|For the price I paid it works great.  Purchased it using amazon local discount.<br />Like the way it stands to view.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|The stories were engaging. The principles clear.  The connection between them seemed forced. Maybe I should read it again to be sure I didn't miss something.

B0064X7FVE|3.0|In trying to figure out the weather channels' system of forecasting, I can only assume the staff is in a windowless building with a random number generator, or perhaps a dart board. While entertaining, the weather channel seems to change the 36 hour data every few minutes. I don't even look at the extended predictions anymore. Taken with a grain of salt, I still begin each day with a jacket and umbrella - and it's ok.
B00338QENI|5.0|Fantastic<br />Very enlightening and full of difficult issues that impact everyone.<br />I recommend this  book.  Great educational value and heart wrenching human intrigue.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|Trivium made an really awesome record with a bunch of great songs that have amazing solos and breakdowns. Keep it up Trivium.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|It was one of the best versions of the book I have seen .I will watch it again and again.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Outstanding cast with a great story line. The cases are always an interesting back drop to the shows drama. Mr. Big is brilliant.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Love the collection, price and delivery speed...awesome!  Grew up with the movies so having them all in one place brings me right back to the 80's...fantastic!
B000MAOLVW|5.0|It is always so interesting to see the race cars from the mid '60s.  It is also great to see the Monaco in the 1960s era as well.  A great trip back in time.
B00CSYR432|5.0|I Loved Anime, specially the one from Mr. Hayao Miyasaki or from Ghili,<br />Walt Disneys, Dreamworks. I really recommend this movie to everyone.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Happy with the application. Also like being able choose which advertisements to look at.<br />Viewers are able to earn points, which can be saved for a particular reward or entered into drawing for gift cards.<br />Quick selector current temperature  for extended forecasts is accurate
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I learner about Duolingo from an ESL teacher.  I enjoy the program probably more than Rosetta Stone and it is free.  Good variety of skills covered.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is one of those really good but rare finds that you want to share with everyone. The author captures the voice of two teenagers going through one of the saddest and hardest cards one can be dealt in the game of life. This book is inspirational and it hurt the entire time when reading because it was so blatantly honest and true. My heart aches but I ask that everyone read this book.
1250038820|5.0|I never buy books that I see people advertise on Facebook. But for the past year, I've felt like Brandon is just a friend of mine, posting his photos with little captions. Then I watched him grow more confident and gain a bigger following. And then, when he said he'd made a book - it was as if one of my best friends was telling me to buy it. I had 100% confidence in him and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />On top of the direct quotes from his subjects, Brandon adds his own commentary in this book (unlike his blog, which he likes to keep out of). It's delightful. In a few words on every page, his sense of humor shines through.<br /><br />This book is the perfect size - not too big, not too small. It has a great cover and the photos inside will make you laugh, smile, cry, and all of the above at the same time. The perfect example of the human experience.
B00B52F278|5.0|As the heading of my review states this is the best television show of all time. Every episode filled with action, drama, sensuality and all the actors chosen seem to fit their role perfectly. I could not give it any less than 5 stars.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|My book club met last night to discuss this book. Not every member was crazy about the author's writing style, but the book was very thought provoking for every single member and the discussion was heated and engaged over questions of parenting, whether or not Jacob was guilty, what intervention by the parents might have accomplished if therapy had been started at a young age. the motivations of the father vs the mother of the child, etc etc. Everybody had read the book (this group has a hard time getting that feat accomplished) and most would recommend it to others as a valuable read.
0545586178|5.0|Here's the problem i see with many trilogy books. the beginnings always catching, the middle is usually a bit slower paced introducing bigger characters and newer conflicts, and the end is to top it off epicly. Suzanne Collins has done one of the rarest things by not only making the middle book  less confusing for the newer readers, but making it even better than the first. somehow, she has managed to turn an already wonderfully plotted book into an even better one. bravo i say. I recommend this book to anyone, from early teens to adults, its very suspenseful and will give you a hard time sleeping at night wondering what will happen next.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|read this several years ago and after seeing the movie I wanted to read it again. It is good a second time around.
1936608898|5.0|after all the paleo/primal/ancestral books i've read, this is the book i'd write to distill all that info down into a fun, fast read. fantastic job Dallas and Melissa!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is an awesome game and the graphics kick @$$. I haven't gotten very far but it has still captured my attention for hours on end.
B00BRUPICM|4.0|Shifting pov from victim to investigator, the author takes you on a roller coaster of empathy and horror. I can't wait to read the next one.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I don't have much to say besides this: I read about 3 books a week in tons of different genres and very rarely have I been enthrall end with a series as I am with this one. Fantastic writing fantastic characters and fantastic plot. Bravo.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Not worth your while. Convoluted plot, non-sense throughout, triviality at its peak, and Jesse Eisenberg continues to play himself. Why did this thing get made?
039916409X|5.0|Not just another book on \\"Tapping\\"/EFT.  Her insights on how to do it and what to do bring about swift transformation!  I highly recommend this book.  Once I applied the wisdom she shares, everything else I had been doing got much, much better results!  I don't know how to say it in such a short space, but her guidance clears what was in the way of the success that was here for me all along. so many others things should have worked (and maybe on some level they did), but this got me the breakthrough I needed.  Thank you Margaret Lynch!
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Love this new CD!!!  This is their most personal material yet.  Beautiful lyrics, awesome melodies and perfect harmonies!!!  Love the backstreet boys more than ever!!!
B0031ESIZQ|3.0|RollerCoaster Tycoon is a great idea. This game is, however, very dated. The mechanics are hard and the interface needs a solid update. Graphics are old. This game is ok if you can stay with it.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|This is a wonderful CD. My wife and I sit down and enjoyed the dvd. We both thought it was Great!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy passing time with this game. It would be nice if it was easier to earn diamonds but that doesn't take away from the fun of the game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen king has once again written a great story. I have always wondered what happen to Danny, and this story has really finished the \\"Shinning\\" saga for me.... loved it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I am often drawn to historical fiction.  The Kitchen House is well written, with well developed characters. I'm not a historian so I can't speak about the likelihood of events that take place. The book is disturbing to read at times, but I enjoyed the story a great deal.
0307730700|5.0|This book was awesome. Once you pick it up and start reading, it will be difficult to set it down. This is a must read.
B005ELQVGW|5.0|A earthy, calm and subdued atmosphere (think vespertine) slammed head first into a hard techno/industrial routine (Skrillex)! Past and future...COLLIDE! As current and trendy as dubstep, but as grounded as a fricken byrds album. Yes, many people will hate it. At some moments it's so scaled back and intimate...with nothing more than a few strings and bjorks delicate vocals. Other moments, a pure wave of techno blasts! Ying and yang...the future and the past. Several gems do stand out...Thunderbolt is a stand out weirdly lurching ballad of HOPE! if you want acessible bjork experience, i would suggest volta, post or debut. but if you want some raw bjork...at her weirdest and more imagined state of being...i'd say this wouldn't be the worst choice.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|Yep. Loved it. Pure fluff.  But great fluff. Fun fluff.  Well acted fluff.  And just a plain old-fashion, Cinderella love story. What can I say?  Sometimes in life, there is the need for fluff. It balances out all the serious stuff, you know what I mean?<br /><br />Yep.  just loved it, lol
B008B403VS|5.0|Item came very quickly and without issue from japan to alaska. In perfect condition, came with everything as described. Was purchased as a birthday gift for my husband to add to his collection. I'm sure he will be very happy.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I downloaded this app during a special when it was free, but after using it several times I would have gladly paid for it. It's well worth it! Tons of options like markers, crayons, paint brushes, colored pencils, and stamps in all colors, as well as tons of colored backgrounds and stickers. So much fun for adults and kids alike! Better than the real thing!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Love the commentary and bonus features. Martha's master class and the set visits are wonderful. Jon and Seamus taking a class together is hilarious. Great season!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|What a treat this book was for me.  I loved it.  A solid love story and page turner.  A must read for all romantics.
0345530578|2.0|I hesitate to give any book less than four stars if it kept my attention enough to finish reading it, but this book is incredibly odd/frustrating in its style. The #1 odd thing about it: It switches between first and third person. Can't say I've ever seen a major writer do this, and frankly it's akin to cheating for a writer to get away with it. I have a feeling if it weren't John Grisham, a publisher would have said, \\"No way.\\" They would require a book be first or third person perspective, not both, especially with zero explanation for how it CAN be both.<br /><br />The book starts off with the first person perspective of the narrator, Malcolm Bannister, who's in minimum security prison, telling us about the realities of living in prison, and why he's there at all. That part is written well and gets you inside the mind of someone who's probably innocent (or mostly innocent), who appreciates how horrible prison is, but also that most prisons are much worse than what he lives with every day, which is horrible enough. Soon enough, a chapter begins with a third person narration of FBI agents in their offices. Their conversation. Their coffee. Who's pacing, who's calm. Right away I thought: \\"Wait, how can the guy in prison recount what's going on in another city?\\" I assumed this would be explained eventually, and THAT would be woven into the mystery, but it wasn't, and how is that fair to the reader? Most of all, how does that make for a good mystery? Yes, we eventually learn who The Racketeer is, but we don't learn how Malcolm Bannister is, apparently, omniscient.<br /><br />If nothing else, and this is not a spoiler, it might have been fun to learn that Malcolm had a contact among the upper echelon of the FBI who was rooting for him or working with him, which would have at least explained how Malcolm had knowledge of exactly what all the FBI guys were doing and talking about and considering at every moment. Instead you are just forced to accept it. Honestly, if I had known this perspective-jumping would never be explained, I would not have finished the book. The biggest question is: Why wasn't this entire book written in third person? It's easier to suspend disbelief that way.<br /><br />As for the plot, it had the potential of being great, but it just wasn't. You should ultimately feel like, \\"Wow, that story played out in such a masterful way and ultimately explained every detail.\\" Uh...not even close. The major subplot with the Nathan Cooley character was overdone and went on too long. And what eventually happens with him wasn't satisfying. And the location-switching almost gave me whiplash. And it never went anywhere interesting! Yes, all that back and forth is probably necessary if you're actually trying to pull off what the characters were trying to pull off, but it became boring.<br /><br />Sorry, Mr. Grisham. I think you generally write great books, but this one needed more discipline.known this perspective-jumping would never be explained, I would not have finished the book.

0385351399|2.0|Eggers notes that he did little research on the technical subjects he's writing about. It shows. Zero credibility equals no suspension of disbelief. Reads like a kid's comic book but is neither scary nor funny nor all that imaginative. Literary? No. Thriller? No. Wake up call? Hardly. Empty characters and lazy plot? Yes. Drags on and on and on and then ends with a thud. Big disappointment.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|Perhaps unlike many people, I read this book after having seen the HBO television series. While I had not seen all the episodes, I fell in love with the characters and the stories. I was not at all disappointed. I love the writing style of the author, almost like a father telling his child a bedtime story. I desperately wanted to read this book, but I was never tempted to skip to the end to see how it finished. I wanted to savor every single word, and I couldn't believe it when it was over! Great book.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|While I love every season of this show, Season 8 really moves the show in an exciting direction! Must watch!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I regret the money I have spent on other sound apps now.  This one is the best and is now the only one that I use.<br />The only app better is by the same company but is not yet available for the Kindle Fire.  Maybe soon?
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I'd recommend this movie to anyone w/ good taste in movies. I was scared at first b/c Gosling was only doing romantic movies b4, but heard my Dad talking about how good this movie is. I watched it and was floored by it. When it was done I was ready to watch it again.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|I enjoy this album, but like some other non-pop records from Sting lately, it is atypical of his usual style and that might turn off some fans.  It has grown on me though and I look forward to seeing how the musical turns out next fall.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read to lose myself for a time. No one takes me away farther or longer than Stephen king. Thanks for the vacation.
B00E6F155E|5.0|I used to have a bootleg DVD of this concert taken from VHS source that was awful quality.  It is wonderful to see how much nicer it looks with a professional transfer!  Peter Gabriel is shown here at the height of his popularity in 1986 while on tour for his amazing album, So.  The entire opening act is included on this disc, which is a fun addition.  Also, for some reason, the Play DVD of his music videos is also thrown in here, even if that has been out for years and I'd expect most fans already have it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many ideas &amp; helpful everyday tips, makes me feel as though I can accomplish anything!  Thank You, PINTEREST!!  Learned it all from Raining Hot Coupons!
B00C76076C|3.0|When Disney did the HD transfer for Little Mermaid, they swapped two shots during &#34;Part of Your World&#34; and has yet to issue a recall or replacement program that addresses the issue.  I love the Little Mermaid, but am saddened by the poor attention Disney pays to some blurays.  It is unacceptable to ship a product with a known mistake and have no plans to fix it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very fun game. easy to play. challenging and nice coin dispensing... don't have to buy any if u font mind just playin
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Very inventive. Lots of twists and turns. Many Beatles touches, but done in a way that feels very fresh. Keeps getting better with every listen.
B00DYCFKSI|5.0|The double LP vinyl discs looks, feels, sounds fabulous - collector's edition. Love at first... audition. Dream Theater strikes again.
B00EJU8ZIG|1.0|i heard her songs and they left me rather  blah and i felt she was trying too hard and i never got the hype for  royal, i found it offensive and like she is  trying to reach on that one.  give her some time and she might have soemthing  because now she sounds like a  novelty act at best.
1250038820|5.0|I love everything about this book. I've been following Humans of New York on Facebook since the page was launched, and have laughed and cried through hundreds of Brandon's posts. He cuts right to the heart of what makes each person an individual, unique, irreplaceable being. It's a celebration of humanity like no other, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|i'll give her credit for keeping a career and having some hype and buzz and also  keeping her name out there in the social media and  following in her  father's footsteps at conquring the  game. now having said all of that, this album is weak and vocally she is a dime a dozen. the album is predictable and it shows an act trying to create a rebel attitude to pass something on to cover the liteweight act she is. i give her Props for making that Paper and doing her thing, however as a music act she is lite in the cakes.
1250038820|5.0|I pre-ordered the book and recieved it today. It was smaller than expected and packed with photos. I started flipping through it immediately. The first few pages I landed on only happened to be images. At first I was like, \\" No, this is not right. Where are the quotes and the stories for every person? What is this person's story?!\\" I couldn't stand seeing a person's photo without knowing more about them, but then I realized that this exact reaction may be the biggest success of all for HONY. Thanks for making us look for the stories behind people. I get it now.<br /><br />Oh and don't worry there are quotes in there- and they are some of the absolute BEST.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Since I'd been captivated by Part 1 of the trilogy (Fall of Giants), I looked forward to this second volume. The characters in Winter of the World are flatter and less interesting. The plot line is contrived to include all the major historical events of the WWII period. The boomerang effect of Russia, England, Hawaii, US, and back is jarring. It is beyond any imagination that a single set of interlinked characters could take part in all these events. The reading is easy and language is clear. But it just isn't on my list of favorites; I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Quite different to the TV series but no less interesting. Very well written and a fascinating and disturbing insight into the prison system in the US.
0743297334|3.0|After hearing about Hemingway all my life, and having read THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA as a teenager and still having a lingering memory of it, I looked forward to plunging in to finally experience Hemingway firsthand as an adult.  I can't say after reading SUN ALSO RISES that I came away rueful of what I've been missing all my life.<br /><br />I appreciate the people who love this book.  I'll grant it moves them.  I understand why it is a milestone in<br />Twentieth Century literature, with the emergence of Hemingway's power-lifting of the language and his famous, \\"clean, well-lighted page.\\"  I acknowledge its deserved place in literary history.<br /><br />But it just didn't grab me.  Ennui and wasted lives--and prodigious amounts of alcohol--didn't hold my attention after awhile.  The characters' liberal use of the \\"n\\" word (Amazon won't let me write it out) when they discuss a black prize fighter was jolting, but can perhaps be forgiven as a throwback to the times.  The insensate cruelty to animals was horrifying, but might be read metaphorically as symbolic of the characters' own wounds and their emotional goring of each other.  The anti-Semitism that runs through the novel, in terms of how the characters view Cohn, is hard to take in any time period and hard to excuse.  Okay, maybe that too is a reflection of the characters' times, especially considering what was coming in Europe.  But add the endless boozing, the occasional brawling, and the bloodied bulls, as well as the copious dialogue that leaves so much for the reader to fill in to try to figure out what's going on with these aimless people and their seemingly trivial lives, and The Souffle Never Rises for me.<br /><br />If you think this novel is great, I won't argue.  I just kept waiting for something to happen, for something definitive to occur, for some resolution of something, no matter how small.  Maybe that is the whole point.  For these characters of the Lost Generation, there is no answer.<br /><br />Probably the reason this tepid novel lives on is Hemingway's revolutionary use of language, which I'll grant is formidable, if not always gratifying.  Sometimes it just seems grating, like a rattling engine that needs oil.  I'll remember the language, if not the story.  The plot?  A group of useless, overindulged people get bored drinking in Paris, so they go to Spain to drink while looking at bullfights, and then they go home (undoubtedly to drink some more).  That's pretty much it.  Can't someone find these tedious characters a job?
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is the best game ever but whenever l try to get on it kicks me off I don't know what happened with it. I hope it will work soon!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really cool app....it's amazing and it looks like its from the 80's! But I think they should add some stuff from the computer version....like actually going to the nether instead of using a nether reactor core.....and villagers.....and DEFFINATELY minecarts.
B00DGGIXS6|1.0|this woman can act, BUT CANNOT sing at all. I thought she retired? LOL and she is touring too? lol ANOTHER FAREWELL TOUR AND RECORD? no thanks cher.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|My first King and Maxwell book. It kept me guessing and waiting for the next twist.  Looking forward to the next one.
1444777556|5.0|This is such a feel-good book.  I read it in two days.  When I was having a bad day it lifted my spirits.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I normally don't read books about wars- they simply don't appeal to me. But I was lured in by the reviews and am so glad I took a chance. I truly couldn't put it down, which was a bit of a problem when it was time to go to work! The story is compelling and beautifully written. Having grown up hearing stories of the brutality of the Germans during the war it was heartwarming to learn of the occasional acts of humanity despite the multiple pressures to kill your enemy. The book not only tells a wonderful story about a heroic act of kindness but also skillfully helps the reader understand both sides of the war, and does so in a non-judgmental way. While it was, at times difficult to read about the German fighter pilots logging their \\"kills\\" knowing that this meant some young American service man had lost  his life the book paints a balanced view of the heartbreak both sides faced. I'm so glad I stepped out of my normal reads and took a chance on this! I loved it so much I plan to read it again!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I bought this for a friend for his birthday and man it's awesome!! I didn't expect it to come in a huge box. The quality is great!! My friend loves it. I can't wait to get one of these for myself. Oh yeah, season two is addictive!!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|The movie was one of the best action films that I have seen in a very long time. I thought the actors were fantastic. The concepts of how different Countrys' tried to deal with the &#34;illness&#34; were pretty inventive. I also thought that the US bailing on some was a realistic viewpoint. Good show.
0061733199|4.0|I enjoy this book a lot. It is informative and a great add to my collection! Even my son has enjoyed reading it, and trying out a few things.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Loving both DVD (at home) and Live Audio CD (in the car).  Brings back memories of seeing MDNA Front Row with my Sister in Phoenix.<br /><br />Battling thyroid and spinal cancer with a fractured spine at L1 Vertebrae, at the time, the airfare, tickets and travel were already booked. NOT missing this concert was a goal, a factor in pushing me to fight back and get better after having Spinal Fusion Rods/Plates/Screws surgically attached to my spine, and having my thyroid removed.  My amazing Godsent team of Doctors are amazing!  That, faith, family, friends and my boyfriend  and even strangers stood together to help me fight \\"the opponent\\".<br /><br />It was HELL, but I wasn't going to allow the Big \\"C\\" to make me miss the concert.  I set the date as a goal to learn how to walk, brush my teeth, basically do everything all over again.<br /><br />MDNA reminds me of those horrible but inspiring and beautiful times of growth, overcoming the seemingly impossible.  I overcame this with much help and was at the concert in Phoenix FRONT ROW crying tears of joy (and from low thyroid hormones!) with my sister, her husband, her son and a friend.  It was brilliant.  Like the show , my experience,  was a parrallel journey from darkness to light.  -VA+
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great movie, if you have seen the play & you enjoyed it then definitely get this movie, you won't be disappointed!
B001AQR3E4|5.0|I likes it. Claudia turns a vampire. but she was a sweet little girl. Also she's killer. I was sad, Claudia died on burn on sun. Louis was bit cried. He gets his revenges. He sets on fires on coffins and theater. That's surprise.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|After reading reviews I was skeptical of this movie... but bought it anyway.  This is not the typical zombie movie.  I was impressed with the action and the story both.  The tension and suspense was terrific.  Needless to say I am glad I bought it.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|It's great! It's so fun having Polaroid film around again. It's retro and the pictures come out looking really great!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Once again George RR Martin has left me not knowing what to read next, other writing seems to pale in comparison. If you read the first four you don't need convincing. If you haven't, START NOW!!!
B00866JL96|5.0|I love this movie, it's a great story. Zac is at his best. It's the best Nicholas Sparks movie made.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I doubt this needs a whole lot of explaining at this point. If you like a story with a lot of plot and character development you'll love these, whether you typically like fantasy or not. George RR Martin is a literary genius, 'nuff said.
B00000J048|5.0|These gears are a great educational toy for children of all ages.  Kids are encouraged to create with this product.  I would recommend this product to others wanting a creative toy for children.
B000I186FW|5.0|We both love the film after watching it. I would recommend this for someone looking for a great movie to watch.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Very suspenseful and exciting to read. Have not read such an intriguing book in a very long time. I wish there was a fourth book!
0446892882|4.0|I really liked this book and am finding it veryuseful. The author not only exposes the ill effects of sugar on the body, mind and personality but goes into the history of sugar and its production. He did a great deal of research and has an impressive bibliography. Slavery, wars, corruption are all part of its history. The author also gives some useful guidelines on how to kick the sugar habit. I am doing so successfully.
0525478817|5.0|When my teen son tells me he wants to read a book & then upon doing so says it is a \\"GREAT book!\\"...well, of course I am curious. That it made him cry made me all the more curious. When the hold list at the library is MEGA long my curiosity is really peeked.  (Yeah Amazon for easy & quick delivery!) So yesterday I read it. In a day. Tackles deep stuff like life and death and love, but in a lighthearted way. There were times as I was reading it I thought, \\"Aha! Finally a great book to suggest to others\\" & although I didn't feel that way so much at the end I am none the less thinking on the book this morning lost in contemplation which is a sign that it is indeed a very good book.
1878424319|5.0|This is a very helpful book and so well written. The author writes from his heart and directly to the heart of the reader. I read it twice and it will have a place on my bookshelves forever. Practical and easy to understand. Everything in it is helpful, there is no extra padding. I think it is my all time favorite self-help book. I can throw away most of the others I have.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The intertwining of the lives could have been handled in a much less obscure and confusing manner. I found my interest waning as the stories characters became increasingly harder to keep track of and even found many of the characters to be superfluous. They were not tied together neatly enough to make them feel practical to the story. I appreciated the historical progression of the Afghanistan culture that was expressed throughout the story  but found the timeline  a confusing distraction.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much!! It's so addicting and me and my brothers love it. Get it!! And it's free so I don't know why you wouldn't get it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This was easy to install, you need to sign up for Netflix service otherwise the movies costs can be incredible.  But the web cast quality is great and my HDMI TV has better quality than my cable.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it's awesome and very fun. It's also very easy to earn acorns so I don't have to buy them yay!
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|I find it hard to enjoy sequels of movies. They waited just enough time to make it. And the story kept you going, can't wait to buy this for a Christmas gift for my boyfriend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I did not know how the writer would be able to top the first book, but she has.<br /><br />It begins with Katniss and Peeta back in District 12. Her defiance in the arena has inspired rebellion in the districts, which through twists and turns puts her and Peeta back in the custody of the Capitol again.<br /><br />I won't say more to allow new readers the joy of discovery. A well-written, fast-paced story. Looking forward to reading the 3rd book.
B008B68IEA|5.0|I bought it to complement the doll and other accesories. Good quality and my niece is just excited with this set!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is fun makes you think but doesn't give u many hints been stuck for awhile lol hope this helps ! Fun fun funnnnn
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I don't remember buying this, but it's a great book.  If you like Doyle and / or mysteries, you won't be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|4.0|hey I love this game u should get it. It may be $6.99 but its totally worth it. There's one problem for me though my minecraft wont update can someone make a post and help me with that
1848507836|5.0|Very well represented.  In GREAT condition! Choice book!  Greatly appreciated!<br />Recommend it to anyone who needs courage to go on.
B00F91H666|5.0|It was a fantastic movie. It was intense throughout the entire film. The gore was not as disgusting as it is in most R-rated zombie films.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I think Stephan King has finally got his mojo back.  Best book I have read in quite awhile. Thanks for a great book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  Totally engrossing. I didn't want it to end.  Will enjoy discussing it with my book group.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|These were a good choice for our triplets. Small enough to take in the car. Helps kids learn how to screw on and unsrew toy.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I'm not sure. This book isn't better than #1 I liked some parts but wasn't interesting to me sorry creators  yeah
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|...more than just zombie killing.  More than the drama of survival.  It goes deeper.  If I was just coming in, because of the hype, I would definitely start with the 1st Season & go all the way through.  Before you know it, you'll want to check out the comics.  Then maybe the novels, if you're a reader.  Might even collect some toys.  You could become obsessed.  Happened to me.  You've been warned!!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Very good story!  Some great twists and an intelligently plotted universe. (If you guys want a review why do I need to write so much?)
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|The 3D Blu-ray releases all have lenticular images on their respective slip-cases to make them easily identifiable as such, right?<br />Wrong! Not for this release... Very basic packaging, not even a slip-case. For some reason, the standard releases all received slip-cases -with the non-3D Blu-ray releases now getting the nice lenticular image!<br />Not only that, but where I purchased my copy, there was no sale price to top it off... I paid full price for just a basic keep-case release!<br />For those buying physical copies, especially only select few, this change-up is most disappointing -like they made a mistake this time around!<br />What is it, 3D Blu-rays aren't selling?
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|G5 games can be really good (think Nightmares from the Deep) or not so good (Magician' s Handbook), so you can't just buy one without trying it first.  Abyss is one of their better games -  good graphics, fairly long, and good hints. The story line was unexpected by me even if it was a little strange. The game is perhaps worth $4.99, a great deal at $2.99 (look for sales).
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Forrest Gump was an awesome movie.  I saw it when it first came out in the movie theatres long ago and I often thought I would like to see it again.  Couldn't believe Prime had it.  They should have more movies that aren't so violent.  Great acting and great story-line.
0297859382|3.0|I can't say this is the best book I have ever read. It is very interesting. It keeps you guessing. It makes you want to jump ahead to see how it turns out. But it is not a make-you-feel-good book. In fact, I think it was a make-you-feel-creeped-out book. It was very unsettling, reading this book. I quit reading it at night so I could go to sleep. I am happy to be finished with it. But I do have to say it was an interesting book, just not a feel good interesting book. There are enough creep-you-out things in the world, I don't care for books like that. So for me, not my kind of book.
039916409X|5.0|I've been following Margaret M. Lynch for quite a while now...and I was so excited to learn of her new book, Tapping Into Wealth...in fact, I heard about it before it was released and was counting down the days until I could get my hands on it.  It did not disappoint!  I will read it again and again...Amazing...!
B000ICZCZS|4.0|About a boy is an amazingly done film. The actors nailed there roles. It is just all very well put together. About a boy is film about a young boy named Marcus who is having trouble with family and school. This movie takes you inside of the story of a 12 year old boy, who's mom almost killed herself. The only gripes i have with the movie is that half way through, the story is nothing....... nothing like the book. I would of have given this 5 stars if Marcus and Ellie went to, Marcus's dad place and followed the book from there. But all in all its totally worth watching this feel good movie.
0545265355|5.0|These books are great books! They also came in fantastic condition. I love that they come in a boxed sleeve so they can all stay together. Would buy again for gifts!

0345529057|5.0|The title says it all. The books came much quicker than expected and they're in good shape. A little worn maybe but no writing or folding in it. An excellent price for 4 books that I love &#60;3
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The Mortal Instruments have had me addicted since page 1. On the last book and it's amazing. One of the best series I've read in a long time.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get his app it is so so so addicting. I cannot stop playing this game. There is so many characters updates and more.  You can also link to Facebook on this app. It is definitely by far the best app I have. And I have close too30 apps.

B00464AVXW|5.0|I waited until now...2013 to see this movie and boy what a mistake. Brad Pitt is fantastic and Morgan Freeman...well, what can I say. This movie has it all...action, romance, creepy....and the end...WOW.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Fun and lots of laughs.  Helen Mirren is the type of character you wished you lived next to.  Makes you realize that you may get old but your not dead yet.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|On a &#34;lark&#34; I decided to watch this, and fell in love, the characters, the setting, the story lines...I can't wait to see all of it.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Yet another amazing album from the great Dream Theater.  From the first moments of the first song all the way to the last song,  keeps you hooked.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Typical problem solving game. Some of the puzzles are pretty hard. Good hints and interesting story. Doesn't have very many levels but still fun for a free game.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I'd rate this as a so-so novel.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this book.  My biggest issue with the book was the way the women were portrayed.  I felt like I was reading a book written in the 1960's or 1970's.  Their lives revolved around keeping a spotless house, running school committees, baking muffins, selling Tupperware, the Church, taking their kids to afterschool activities, and commiserating about their daft husbands who couldn't operate a washer or organize a carpool if their lives depended on it.  I kept expecting one of them to realize there's more to life than making the perfect souffl&eacute;, burn her bra, and ride off into the sunset with the young hippie who had shown her that sex could be fun.  It seemed like it was going to turn out to be that kind of book - although it wasn't.  Maybe it's because it's an Australian book, but the women seemed totally unreal to me.  They didn't behave like any women I know.<br /><br />I enjoyed the second half of the book more than the first because the separate threads started to come together and the plot took some interesting twists and turns.  It does make you think, although, once again, the choices the characters made didn't always ring true to me.  The author did include an interesting epilogue that showed how a few slight changes in what people had chosen to do many years ago could have led to vastly different outcomes for all the characters. It was a nice touch.<br /><br />I couldn't wholeheartedly recommend this book because I found the portrayals of the women to be so bizarre, but it's not a terrible book.  I guess it just hit the wrong note for me.
1781166277|4.0|Read this because you understand that it is part of the Castle TV show, and not great literature. A fun read, but not Patterson level.
B00B4804KS|5.0|GREAT SHOW NOW ADD 3D IT BECOMES BETTER. GRAND KIDS LOVE THIS MOVIE ADD POPCORN AND YOU CAN HEAR THEM SCREAM 2 HOUSES AWAY
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|1) Chromecast player DOES NOT support the 5GHz band. If you want to use it, you must have a wireless access point running in the 2.4GHZ. with all the trash and interference Put mine on 5 GHz and Chromecast can't find the network.<br /><br />2) While Hulu Plus may be supported, it's not with the Hulu plus IOS client as of the date of this writing. If you want to use it you have to cast from the Chrome browser.<br /><br />3) Quality has been very good casting from iOS (iPhone 5, 7.0.2). Casting from the Chrome Browser on my MacBook Pro, i7, 16 GB Ram, 1GB Video ram has been a mixed experience.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, if Apple's AppleTV is a hobby, this device is even more so at the current level of support. It's not a Roku (which I also have). That said, it's small, very portable, cheap, self powered as long as your TV also has a USB Port, and useful to take with when traveling. I'm not sending mine back.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I LOVE ALL SCI FI THIS IS A GOOD GODZILL WITH THE POWER RANGERS MOVIE WITH 3D AND GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|My movie enjoy all Star Trek movies. With the 3D and special effects this is one of the best yet
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This look at Jesus and the tensions between his early disciples and Paul provides interesting commentary and context for the life of Jesus. I plan to read the entire New Testament again through the filter of this book. It will be an interesting journey.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Hard to believe Pearl Jam have been around as long as they have.  Just seems like yesterday when Ten came out.  With that said, I am certainly glad they have endured the time and still producing their creative style of music.  Lightning Bolt is a mature Pearl Jam that has learned to harness all their power of the past and use it like an accomplished painter.  All the writing both musical and lyrical is focused and superbly executed.  Like another reviewer said, when you start this album you want to finish it.  That element in itself is what makes timeless records.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|I prefer Paul's pop leanings and like about half of the songs on the disc. I recommend the deluxe edition for \\"Turned Out\\". It's a bonus track that isn't junk & has a great Tom Petty produced by Jeff Lynne sound to it. Other favorites \\"New\\" and \\"Everybody Out There\\". Note: I first heard the album as compressed MP3 files which made Paul's voice sound thin. The CD sounds many shades better and does justice to Paul's artistry. I don't like everything the man ever recorded but I do have unbounded respect for his ability to evolve and perform  just about any style of music. Don't forget that he has also written classical music and is a multi-instrumentalist.  Sir Paul has no peers and like Sinatra before him, he is  the \\"Chairman\\" of the rock world.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Not so much a tired concept, although many may think so. I generally eat this series up. But Bruce actually seems kind of tired in this one. I think it would have been bettter if there had been a more parental theme to the father son relationship.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|A great story line but  as per the norm for Mr King, the ending is lacking.  This book is worth the read  .  I only wish he had a little more imagination to finish it.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|I am a lover of sci fi movies but almost always end up disappointed. This one was a little confusing and probably a bit long. But worth a watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its amazing. minecraft its cubes its math wow spawner<br />eggs. I love minecraft this is amazing<br />get this app its amazing
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|You ay want to watch this one twice. But I found the story compelling and the movie paced very well.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was hoping for so much more from google.  This is a piece of crap.  Limited funtionality.  Great if you dont have an internet connected TV.  But really who is going to buy this that doesnt already have this funtionality through DLNA compliant TV.  Dont waste your money till Google increases support and funtionality.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am obsessed with the entire series. Keeps you interested and always guessing, definite page turner! Highly recommend this series!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is awesome I mean cool if you like action with sadness and drama. You would love the hunger games series
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter and I both really love this game. Love that the levels get increasingly harder with more colors and a bigger board.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell writes thought provoking books.  David and Goliath is thought provoking and causes the reader to see the world from a slightly different view-point.  I appreciate the fresh perspective he brings with his writings.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Loved this book! A definite page turner with an excellent plot. Loved the entire series, can't wait for the last book!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|What a wonderful series!  Reminds me a bit of Freaks and Geeks, but with up-to-date kids and not so freaky.  Jenna is truly a role model for all girls to look up to on the ways she deals with the bullys at school.  The writing is genius - really refreshing and honest.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Really enjoyed this entire series! I love Greek/Roman mythology and this entire series is completely based off of it! Loved it!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Kept me riveted and wanting more after every show ended.  Never got sappy but stayed true.  Quite a good chiller.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|My kids really like this movie! It is a great watch for the entire family. We bought this for the Kindle, kids love watching it on trips.
B00C2IGQBA|3.0|This would have gotten a higher review had it come with a booklet on the inside. Paid under $10, so there is at  least that...<br /><br />CLASSIC MOVIE!!!!
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Loved every minute of this book. Bein told from the male point of view, by an author who has seemed to have done her homework. Funny, loving, and so true on many points. What a breath of fresh air coming from the &#34;other side&#34;.
B00BI5IXL4|1.0|As a long time fan of Les Miserable and a stack of cast albums longer than my arm, I was exited to have a film adaptation.  I was truly disappointed in the theatre.  The actors, their voices, the sets...the whole lot.  I sat down to watch the movie again at home and I just couldn't sit through it.  I doubt I will ever try again.<br /><br />This movie is simply \\"unwatchable.\\"  Treat yourself instead to the 10th Anniversarry Dream Cast  [[ASIN:B00110K62U Les Miserables: The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall]]
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This is a classic horror story, told in letters and journal entries of each of the protagonists. A very interesting style. And a classic, spell-binding read. I would often think about how the story is the perfect metaphor for international bankers enslaving the world with debt--and really, illusion. Virtually every part of this story supports this interpretation, in both the big and small portions of it. But regardless of whether you agree with this premise, it's still REQUIRED reading for anyone interested in the origins of horror. A-plus!!
0141439610|5.0|I loved how the characters weaved in and out in each out. Very unique for the time period. I love all of Anya Seton's books so it did not surprise that I consumed The Woman in White.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Find this an interesting take on youth dealing with cancer.  Liked their attitude and humor in spite of a dire outcome.
B00138H506|5.0|Right after The Dave Matthews Band had entered the 21st Century in full force         and just as mighty as ever, they would release another highly lauded masterpiece         in 2001 that proved they were a powerful music force to be reckoned with and still         remained in high demand live in concert and in the recording studio.   Everyday is         another bonafide blockbuster that takes on a more contemporary edge and highly         versatile musical landscape where it feature solid dashes of high voltage rock and         EDM-style riffs that make this high-pitched CD a true rousing listening experience.         Highlighted with a robust tack set that starts off on the pulse-pounding Top Ten hit         I Did It, it feature other high-rocking songs like When The World Ends, The Space         Between, I Had It All, What Are You, Dreams Of Our Fathers and the reggae-style          title track, for which the band handle with striking momentum, compassionate soul         and eclectic artistry.  Filled with complex solos, zesty exuberance and even some         heartfelt moments, Everyday will give you plenty of great satisfaction the band has         to offer which make this wonderful rock classic such a timeless first rate stroke of         genius that ranks along with there greatest and most beloved masterpieces.  Also         featuring guest appearances from master rock guitarist Carlos Santana and noted         South African folksinger Vusi Mahlasela, Everyday would even marked the band’s         departure from producer Steve Lillywhite because of production indifferences, and         their first for Glen Ballard, who have become the band’s full-time producer in 2002.         However I may have to highly recommend this great album, because it will provide         you with a unique head-spinning listening experience which will remain electrifying         as ever with true rewarding and boldly stunning results.

B0040JCJOC|5.0|With The Dave Matthews Band already established as a world class rock band         in their own right in the wake of their longtime record contract with RCA, the would         become the phenomenal concert sensation for the rest of the 1990’s--and beyone.         Described as a follow-up to there breakthrough masterpiece Under The Table And         Dreaming, the band did it again in 1996 when they released their next masterpiece         Crash, which conquered the charts on an even bigger level as it again showcase a         first class act done with an incredible upbeat momentum.  Featuring an electrifying         track set that rocks with energy and vitality, the CD produced some classic hits like         So Much To Say, the rollicking  Two Step, Crash Into Me, the smash hit Too Much         and Drive In Drive Out, as well as other unforgettable songs like Say Goodbye, Lie         In Their Graves, #34 and Proudest Monkey, as they perform them with excellence,         passion, high-rocking merit, amour and striking empathy.  Highlighted by swinging         melodies, rocking saxophone interplay performed to the hilt, stirring artistry, a high         voltage tone and solid composing, Crash delivers a tour de force music experience         as this powerhouse blockbuster delivers an exhilarating blow filled with satisfaction         and astonishing virtuosity as the band performs it to such a dazzling effect.  Hailed         as one of the band’s greatest and most important achievements, I have to suggest         that you include this masterpiece in your MP3 set—along with The Dave Matthews         Band’s timeless albums, as Crash will remain as highly energetic as both a award-        winning success and a timeless testament for the band.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Well written and surprisingly fast paced for the subject matter. Drew me in and kept me going, even though it sometimes made me feel the stress of a day in the office. Packed with great practical ideas in the IT and business world.

B005QYKE2Y|3.0|Meh, I've Seen Better Movies, But Probably The Best Transformer Movie. Longer Than I Expected, Actually Developed Characters A bit
B001974DG0|5.0|Great book.  I loved the character development, the action, the twists, the plot,  and the climax.  Everything about this book was pretty awesome.  It was clearly fiction but it all seemed really believable.  I find it very hard to get 5 starts out of me, but I absolutely give it 5.

B00C50NV2M|5.0|Several years ago I bought the Sony 60 inch 3D when it first came out.  At that time the 3D glasses used replaceable batteries and were heavy and uncomfortable to wear for an entire movie.  Over time Sony has updated the glasses for TV use and made them lighter with an internal rechargeable battery.  I now use the TDG-BR750 glasses.  Although I do not need to wear glasses when watching TV programs the BR750's are designed for users with glasses.  I initially paid about $100 per pair of glasses at a Sony Style store.<br /><br />When I saw the TDG-500P glasses for about $10 I ordered two pairs.  The design is similar to the BR750's but there is no internal battery.  When I tried using them with my 3D Sony TV I found that they were not compatible.  When I went to see Gravity 3D I took a pair of the 500P's with me and they worked fine in the theater.  Like the BR750's you can wear these with glasses.  The glasses that the theater hands out look as though one would have a problem using with glasses.<br /><br />If you are concerned about using the theater glasses due to health issues, such as someone else using them before you, then for a $10 I would recommend the 500P's.<br /><br />The AMC theater I went to had no problem with me using my own glasses.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|DOCTOR SLEEP is a brilliant return to form for Stephen King, and is at once terrifying, captivating, and exhilarating. King has created a wonderful set of heroes in Abra Stone and Dan Torrance, and a horrifying set of villains in The True Knot. A satisfying read for anyone who enjoys suspense, and a must read for fans of King.
1250038820|5.0|HONY is my favourite corner of the internet, its a reading ritual that goes well with my morning coffee.<br />The book is stunning, I got a extra copies to send home to my nieces and nephews in Australia, as that is my role to them - to send back pieces of the world to inspire them.<br />I have not found anything that comes close as a more cohesive way to send that message than this book.<br />A rollercoaster of emotions, it never ceases to amaze me the fascinating people he finds, and yet we are reminded that we all are fascinating creatures.<br />So that, and the spin offs that exist around the world.. is what NASA really should be packing on those probes, as I feel this is the most honest reflection of people on this planet.<br />Thank you Brandon.  I treasure my book.  I am sure my family will also love it too.

B00CH26TL8|4.0|I am happy you only get so many lives or I may never put it down. I like the updates. A good replacement for Candy Crush.
B00DW39B2K|3.0|Killing Season is movie about Benjamin Ford (De Niro) who is a career soldier who is now spending his retirement in virtual isolation in his cabin in the woods struggling to forget the horrors that he experienced while in the Bosnia. While Emil Kovac (Travolta), a Bosnian who is really a Serbian war criminal who was captured and supposedly executed by Ford and his fellow NATO troops after they liberated a Bosnian internment camp that he was helping to run. Having survived the bullet Ford put in his back, Kovac has finally tracked him down and now wants to go after him in a fair fight in order to get revenge and exorcise his demons about the conflict.<br /><br />Considering the star power involved and the story premise which on the surface seems like a great plot line, I had high expectations for the movie.  Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed as it didn't quite live up to what I had hoped it to be.  The acting is ok enough as both De Niro and Travolta do a decent job at playing their roles.  The problem here is the storyline meanders a bit and is a bit choppy all the way through and the action sequences are a bit of a letdown.  The movie at times is a bit slow and boring as well.<br /><br />Not a terrible movie, but could have been so much more if only the story was better developed and the action a bit better.  The setting was pretty though as I recognize a lot of the places that it was filmed.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I previously had access to the series via individual season purchases many years ago. But these were lost a few years back in a burglary. We finally saved up enough to get the entire series packaged together and couldn't be happier with the set... except for the packaging. This set uses folios composed of stiff card stock with integral pockets for each DVD. There is no soft lining for each pocket and they are very tight. We have already begun to note scratches on the DVD surfaces and have only been through the series twice. Can't say enough about the quality of the programming and the price was less than 1/3 what we paid for the individual seasons 7 years ago but I am concerned that the packaging won't be up to our use over the next 10 years.
B002MCYWHG|1.0|I was super excited to take my boy for rides with this. Got the product and it didn't fit any of the 3 bikes I own. it is advertised to fit most bikes but it simply isn't true. you MUST have at least 1-2\\" of extra frame space (stem tube) above the top tube. This should be explained and not simply, \\"it will fit most bikes\\". which, again, I found to be false.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just started playing the game but so far it is pretty good to play. So if you want something to play for hours on end then this is the game for you.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|One of the best hunting apps I've played . Would recommend it.. it is a little too easy to win though..Fun game. Very nice graphics
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|This was a very good movie  My grandson and I really enjoyed it.  It had comedy and drama to make it great!!

B008JFUO72|4.0|The movie was okay, but I liked the 1st and 2nd better.  It just did not have the same flare as the others.
B0011UGLK6|2.0|Unrelated stories about dull people who hate their lives, hate where they live and really have no friends.  I only read this because it was for my book club.  Otherwise, I would have stopped on the first story. They go nowhere.  Nothing happens until the very last story, but I even saw that coming.

1780721676|5.0|My husband and I had been trying to drop weight for the past 3 years, but not until we started The Fast Diet and doing the recommended modified fast 2 days a week were we successful.  Since we began last April (exactly 6 months ago), my husband has dropped about 20 lbs. and I've lost about 15. We find it much easier to watch our calories 2 days a week than at every meal as we'd tried to do earlier, unsuccessfully. We, no doubt, could've lost more if we'd watch ourselves on other days as well, but we actually eat hardy the days that we're not doing the fast diet and are happy with the results.  Good luck to all!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it. Best game ever. It gets a little difficult but all the more interesting. Helps with brain training and keeps you sharp.

B00EUS9JF0|5.0|McCartney's record &#34;New&#34; assembles an impressive, eclectic set of new songs that share the positive energy that flows beneath much of McCartney's best music.  In addition to the hit songs &#34;New,&#34; &#34;Save Us,&#34; and &#34;Everybody Out There&#34; which McCartney played in some of his recent promotional concerts, the album features an array of catchy songs to which I have just finished listening for the first time.  My first impression is that &#34;New&#34; is a labor of love in which McCartney plays many of the instruments including guitar, piano, bass, drums, and percussion on the songs.  He purposefully creates a musical web that cannot be fully digested in one listen --- this is an album to which one can listen many many times without exhausting its nuances.  Musically, McCartney explores new territory with this album with connections to his early work with the Beatles, Wings, and McCartney II as well as strong connections to Flaming Pie, Driving Rain, Chaos and Creation, Memory Almost Full, and the Firemen. All of the songs are excellent including the two listed bonus tracks and the unlisted (hidden) bonus track.  The song &#34;I Can Bet&#34; would make an interesting single as would &#34;Save Us.&#34;  I really liked the bonus track &#34;Turned Out.&#34;  .
B00DV3A84G|5.0|This album is amazing. There is no need to skip tracks... all of them are awesome. I can't get enough of this band. They are truly talented and I can't wait to hear more from Bastille!
B00003CX5A|5.0|And to me, the story this film is based on is a classic.  And so is the cartoon.  So I am happy to say, in my eyes, this movie is also a classic.  The music is wonderful, the sets and landscapes are perfectly dark and scary, the stars selected for their parts were selected with a eye towards fitting their characters.  Johnny Depp plays his Ichabod Crane as a man of SCIENCE but also a man who can't really stand the sight of blood and becomes easily scared when his world view that ghosts and goblins don't exist is threatened by what may be a REAL ghost.  The story starts out as a simple murder mystery (well, not THAT simple) which soon becomes more complex with a dead man's will, a witch (or two), and the Headless Horseman who may, or may not, be real.  The Headless Horseman is played by a real stunt man, not a computer generated spirit, so much of the fighting is real.  But the movie is not supported by special effects alone but by the strength of the performance from the actors, the solid and detailed story, and the gritty, muddy, landscape that they used for the Sleepy Hollow.  I would suggest this for any film library but it is rated R, so kids should not be watching it.  And maybe some adults should not either, as while not THAT scary, there is a lot of blood and some upsetting scenes.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I am addicted this game is new and different I even downloaded on my galaxy s3.  Enjoy the hunting It feels great to be the shark
B008JFUNNM|5.0|Saw the Tom Hanks version of Captain Phillips today.<br />Don't think I would have enjoyed the Tom Cruise version.<br />Tom Hanks was great.<br />I thought it was a great movie.<br />Several times during the movie,<br />I had to remember to breathe.<br />But in hindsight,<br />I realize the pirates were just democrats trying to get what someone worked for,<br />and earned.<br />Great movie.<br />Go see it.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|I think that it's a good game. I don't know why people are saying it's bad. I think it's good and I'm not a fake.Yes it might be hard but it's fun. If your not sure if it's good or not get the demo.I got one thing to say,this game is good.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Best album I've heard so far this year and as a big fan of well-written metal/rock this might be the best album of the decade so far. Mark and Myles have perfected their formula and I can guarantee you that this album will be a grower for a lot of people. The songwriting is impeccable and that is cause for excitement in a world of vile and boring pop with a dead rock scene. Rock fans rejoice!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book made me feel actual emotion. The ending made me cry! The descriptions and details of the characters were just beautiful! The back and forth perspective between Elenanor and Park was great. It may seem racist but it's not, Park is Asian and his mother is from Korea, Rowell writes her in the accent...I thought this was absolutely a brilliant detail...  GREAT JOB! I will be reading more Rainbow Rowell books!!! I'm wishing for a sequel to this one though!!!
B003IDMUX6|2.0|Having read most of Grisham's legal thrillers, I assumed this book would be worth reading. I thought the basic idea was good - escape the consumerism and materialism and celebrate Christmas whatever way you like. Then the neighbours start piling in in a most un-Christian way, and life becomes a major hassle. The trouble was I felt no urge to continue reading, no real interest in the \\"plot\\" - if you could call it that.<br /><br />Then the story, such as there was of it, started to become very familiar and I realised I had seen the film! Disaster! I knew how it ended, and what the moral of the story was.<br /><br />I didn't find it funny, to be honest, and straight afterwards I went back to read Grisham's \\"A Time to Kill\\" to remind myself why I liked him as an author in the first place.<br /><br />[I had also read \\"A Painted House\\" recently, and while it was a nice study of life in rural Arkansas, it was also very slow, and the plot was \\"scattered\\". With respect, Grisham, I'd stick to the legal thrillers. Those are the ones I love.]
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Saw this movie 2 or 3 times before on TV, but wanted to add it to my collection of \\"must haves\\", and Amazon delivers promptly.  Watch this movie on a rainy or snowy day, as it's a long movie, about 3 hours, park your butts and curl up on the sofa with a blanket, you're going nowhere.  Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman at their best!  Not going to tell you about the ending here....just watch it!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like that. you can add songs for wake up tone. it gets 4 as it could use some improvement. but Robt omost everything need improvement.  it is on. the better side for alarm clocks
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|I guess all it takes these days is to be a former member of a famous band and your legacy is sealed forever.  Sorry, but the last time McCartney released anything worth paying attention to was his first solo album that was beautiful in its simplicity and scattered pieces of Ram and some Wings stuff.  Awesome live performer, but nothing really sticks and most of it sounds like dittys that any songwriter could put down.  one music lover's narrow opinion, take it or leave it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun game!!!Those that have seen the movies you know all the characters in the game. All ages love this game for the most part. Even my mom loves it she is 43 years old!!! love number 1 fan Jennifer

B007WEQ3K8|4.0|It's only $0.99 very worth that price. I wouldn't pay much more. It is pretty fun, especially when you figure that you're learning as well. I think we could all use a little brain exercise.
B003008RWA|4.0|I was assigned to watch this movie for a class and ended up very impressed ! I actually enjoyed the movie . It was also the first movie I &#34;rented&#34; from amazon , and I would definitely rent a movie again !
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I have to say that Mr King still has it. It was great to get re acquainted with Dan and introduced to all the new characters. This was a great sequel and I highly recommend this novel to anyone that enjoys good old fashioned story telling.
B0007TKNII|4.0|Over all a good film, not perfect and not in the realm of our first choice for a 5 star script and plot but on the plus side of tolerable.<br />We love the musical score and the talent of the performers, 5 stars for that.<br />The plot and flashback effects are good, a bit risqué in places but tastefully done none the less.<br />I think possibly the best is that we did not get bombarded with two plus hours of impossible violence, theatrical gore and enough profanity to make death row sound like a monastery.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Fun game great graphics but it takes to long to get enough gold coins because you need to pay cash for them which makes the game take forever to progress in would rather just pay for the app than needing to pay to progress I have patience and never buy the gold not spending cash on virtual items

B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I rented this movie to download for a plane trip.  It was good. Was definitely a chick flick but enjoyable.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|This story is at times beautiful, at times boring. I hate to describe it as this, because I have loved Elizabeth Gilbert's books and find her story-telling to be lovely. Honestly there were chapters that kept me spellbound and towards the end I felt 'let down' in the story. I'm not sure if I was looking for the characters to be different than they were or what!? All in all, I am glad I read this story. Not every story has to enthrall me to be enjoyable. Gilbert's use of words in the right places is beautiful in itself.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|The movie was better than I assumed having not reviewed the plot. I enjoyed the entire movie which kept me interested and in suspense. I enjoy sci-fi movies and give this a good rating to enjoy on one of the quiet nights at home.

I saw the show live and there is no dvd can truly replicate that, however it allowed me to see more clearly those sections which were obscured by the crowd noise, etc. I hope she tours again and I will be there again. Love you Madonna.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The story had enough twists and turns to hold my interest. If you have read some of the other stories with Pendergast you will no doubt recognize some of the familiar characters as well as new additions.

Good story -  I cared about the characters and the ending was satisfying.

1612930425|5.0|How can one review Pride and Prejudice, possibly the most widely read, praised, filmed, glossed novel in the English language, a book by an author who now appears on the £10 note, a book that is the object of tens, perhaps hundreds of academic articles and manuals yearly and the excuse for as many re-enactments, balls, period festivals, and so forth? It feels almost as impertinent as reviewing Shakespeare: for this reason, I will keep to a potpourri of contextual and other observations in the hope that some may be found interesting.<br /><br />First, while Austen was already esteemed in her lifetime, she apparently enjoyed a popularity revival in the early twentieth century - a revival that has kept snowballing since. Traditionally the explanation is that as Britain underwent a period of war and social strife, the regency period became regarded as a golden age and Austen enjoyed new-found nostalgia appeal. I wonder though, to what extent the feminisation of society is not an alternative or at least a complementary explanation. The early twentieth century, after all, was an age of female empowerment, with the suffragette movement and the enhanced access to the workplace brought by WWI. The last decades of Austen mania have seen the triumph of feminism, the rise of women's studies, etc.. It isn't just that Pride and Prejudice has a heroine for its main protagonist; it centres on the central feminine concern of the regency era that was marrying well.<br /><br />Second, stylistically Pride and Prejudice is not at all what I expected (having only read one other Austen many years ago: Northanger Abbey, and not remembering that much of it). Austen's sentence structures are impeccable and a pleasure to read. Yet some things we have come to expect of novels are almost entirely absent from this one. There are no descriptions to speak of, for example, whether of people or places. The book might almost be a play, consisting essentially of dialogue and some narrative. I have been told that Austen was a great innovator. Her book was much shorter than contemporary novels, which tended to run on and digress to the point of being wearisome. She invented free indirect speech, itself the precursor to stream-of-consciousness writing, and was able to vest her characters with a far deeper psychology than was usual. The problem for the lay reader is that, these things having been imitated and adopted by subsequent authors, they fail to appear innovative anymore and the novelty value is largely lost.<br /><br />The third thought that occurred to me is that for a novel that first appeared in 1813, this feels very much like an eighteenth-century work. By this I mean that the social scale it deals with is incredibly narrow, almost the full cast of characters being more or less rich members of the idle gentry. Between Pride and Prejudice and George Elliott or even Trollope, let alone Dickens, there is a chasm. The industrial revolution and its social concerns had intervened, except of course by 1813 it was already a reality. So Elizabeth Bennet and her sisters might have to make do with five hundred a year rather than marrying a wealthy squire like Darcy. What about the mass of people who were on fifty a year, or less? Still, it appears that Austen was in this respect also actually a pioneer. Elizabeth has cousins who are in trade, and still she manages to overcome that stigma and vault into the landed classes. At the time, this apparently bordered on revolutionary.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice otherwise feels in many respects like a comic novel. It is light, funny, and ironic. I can't help wondering in what spirit it was composed, and whether Austen realised that she was writing a masterpiece. I guess I will have to get my hands on some of that bottomless academic literature.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|i already own smart tv. this is much faster than the tv to play youtube, netflix from ur cell phone, macbooks etc. only drawback is u cant play local files on your laptop or cellphone. multiple devices can stream at same time without even having to pair.

B0002IQMKM|5.0|\\"The Best of Talking Heads\\" is one of the most entertaining greatest hits album I own. The sound on these 18 tracks is superb, clean and crystal clear. Whoever was in charge of the re-mastering process did an excellent job. The album spans from 1977-1988 of this amazing avant-garde/new wave band from New York. David Byrne, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, and Jerry Harrison not only created great, catchy music together, but they also flawlessly wrote music that was way ahead of its time. I also feel that this band never really got the credit they deserved. Yes, they are in the Rock and Roll High of Fame, but they were never a big household name during their artistic peak. Anyway, you get a little bit of everything in terms of different styles of music: punk, funk, old school hip-hop, calypso, pop, grunge, (before it went mainstream) and dance. I like every song, but I think the 5 essential tracks on this collection are: \\"Found A Job\\", \\"Houses in Motion\\", \\"Girlfriend is Better\\", \\"Burning Down the House\\", and \\"Road to Nowhere\\". I feel like these songs brilliantly showcase the bands extraordinary diversity. Byrne's songwriting is quirky, absurd, (in a good way), but always comes across as sincere. There are so many different topics he writes about: making up your own t.v. shows, drugs, complaining about the \\"the good life\\", politics, psycho killers, paranoia, and of course love. There's a great cover of Al Green's \\"Take Me to The River\\", and the song that always makes me smile is \\"(Nothing But) Flowers\\". In \\"Flowers\\" - Byrne takes the opposite approach and reminisces about how there's no more 7-11's and how he \\"cant get used to this lifestyle...\\" and wants all the cornfields to vanish. I love Byrne's sarcasm and ironic nature. I've been listening to this greatest hits collection all summer. It's freakin' awesome! Just saying. So do yourself a favor and dip your toes in the weirdness that is the Talking Heads. Enjoy!

0979019710|5.0|The Miracle Morning has been key in changing my life for the better!  This book is a quick and easy read, but loaded with gems of practical wisdom.  In the Miracle Morning, Hal gives us the often missing link in many of the \\"positive self help\\" books out there; The action steps necessary to achieve living a Level 10 life, not just the \\"secrets\\" of visualizing and thinking your way to a better life.  He can help you go from being delusional and unrealistic with your goals to positively, realistically, optimistically living them.  The book also includes a link to download an incredible Fast Start Kit to take the 30-Day Life Transformation Challenge.  Hal has gone above and beyond in his out pouring of self giving love and knowledge.  I can't recommend this book enough!

0763655465|5.0|My 3 year old boy loves this book and so do I.  It's very funny and the illustrations of George and that guilty dog look  make the book.  George reminds me of several dogs I have known.  My three year old relates to the difficulty of the choices, and that George isn't always able to control himself, although he has the best intentions.  George really does want to please, like any 3 year old.  His owner, like his parent, forgives him and they try again.  George learns from his mistakes and is very good, mostly...

B00DZPVS9O|5.0|The Space Lord has returned with a gem of an lp! Not since the days of Dopes To infinity, has Monster Magnet sounded so true to its origin. In times of crappy singles,gimmicks and just non-sense in music, this lp gives life back to true music lovers! I live Behind the Clouds says it all, what a beginning to a great journey of The Last Patrol. Paradise is a true gem, and Hallelujah has me singing along with it instantly. Mindless Ones, truely sums up the music era and time we are all slaves to.The Duke of Supernature is just heaven in a song, while End of Time brings you back to consciousness with a killer upbeat tempo. Thank God for Dave Wyndorf, the bonus track One Dead Moon is worth buying the deluxe edition, however I recommend the lp version. The artwork is truely amazing, if not award-winning, this is how music should be heard, felt, seen, and loved! Home-run for Monster Magnet, a band forgotten by the sampled, played out, trendy, so called modern music fans of today, learn to play an instrument and write your own songs, Space Lord never forgets!!! Stay tuned til next time and we'll see what's what.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I saw an article regarding this Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming player so I went to Amazon to get more information. It got good reviews so I ordered it, as did many other people. It was on back order so it took some time for it to arrive. When it got here, it was easy to install and works great.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|Christoph Fischer is one of my favorite \\"Undiscovered writers\\" who, with the publication of the final book of his Three Nations Trilogy, is certain to become known to a wider audience. He writes detailed historical fiction in an approachable way that places the reader in the period. Before I go on about The Black Eagle Inn, I must again recommend his first two books; The Luck of the Weissensteiners and Sebastian.<br /><br />In The Black Eagle Inn (The Three Nations Trilogy) by Christoph Fischer, the author takes us into a sweeping tale of a Bavarian family during the twentieth century. It is a journey of an unremarkable family as they endure the history, hardships and celebrations that came with life during that period. Fischer has many strengths as a writer but creating characters that come alive within the pages may be his best. After reading his work, I feel I know some of these people better than my own family. I care about them, they occupy my thoughts when the book is no longer in my hands. His ability to weave multiple story lines within a grand plot is remarkable and proof his audience with grow. Very highly recommended - deserving of six stars.

B003NTSBUG|4.0|This one of my favorite movies and I was excited when I saw that it was on Amazon. The picture came out very clear and the sound was great as well. However, it cut out before the last ten minutes. It may have been due to my poor internet connection.

0525478817|5.0|The is Fault in our Stars is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Along with an excellent plot it makes you: laugh, cry and clap for the characters. This is one of those books that you read and want more, but you know that it is also a book that must stand alone. You know any thing else would bring down the perfection that is &#34;The Fault in our Stars.&#34;

B00F0N7JUG|4.0|I'm a huge mech and monsters fan, so I was in love with this film from day one. Guillermo Del Toro is a cinematic god and being able to listen to his commentary, viewing his sketchbook and all the other added digital content is fabulous! The packaging however, leaves a lot to be desired. I had already ordered the less expensive combo pack, when Amazon sent me an email about the Exclusive Limited Edition Collector's version accompanied by an imagine that seemed to be of reasonably sized action figure. I was sold! So, when I called home the day it was delivered and was told I had received a \\"book sized box from Amazon\\", I was a bit confused. Wait, that thing looked like it was at least 10 inches tall and substantial? Maybe they'd mixed up my order... Nope just another Amazon-fueled gotcha on a Collector's Edition. (I'm probably a bit harsh, because I was also burned in the Marvel Cinematic Universe Ironman Briefcase armour packaging fiasco.)<br /><br />The Good: BD content and other special features are worthwhile if you are a fan of the film.<br /><br />The Bad:  The flimsy 'book size' Collector's Edition plastic case. Even the details/paint on this thing are sketchy (not in a good way). It's a hollow, light-weight construction and only about 7 inches high.<br /><br />The Ugly: The already sketch case will only stand upright with your discs gathering dust stacked up on the \\"kickstand\\" spindle in the back. What's the point of a case that both stacks the product (hello, scratches) and leaves them exposed to dust...unless of course you just keep the whole contraption in it's box.<br /><br />Haven't been this disappointed since the Non-Wearable Halo 3 Master Chief Helmet debacle of '07. #fangirlingishard
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I absolutely love John's professional approach to writing books... Serve the customer (reader), meet their needs (entertain, inform or both), connect with them personally (be real), create simple systems, set actionable goals, and repeat. This is what has worked for me in my software company, in my coaching business, and with my insurance clients. Now implementing it with the books I'm publishing and can't wait to see the results. Thanks so much, John
1250038820|5.0|This book exceeds my expectations in every way.  As a long time HONY fan, I didn't think that would be possible, because my expectations were already exceptionally high.<br /><br />The book opens with an interesting four-page telling of the HONY story by Brandon Stanton.  I found it well worth reading despite knowing how the blog started out.  But the best part in my opinion is the extremely high quality of the photos themselves.  Having only seen Brandon's photos on Facebook and Tumblr, I find the sharp detail and vibrant colors compelling.  Even if I had seen every one of these photos before, I would consider this book an excellent investment - in print, they're absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />I'm going to get an extra copy, because I know I'm going to want to give this book to everyone I know.  This is the first &#34;dead tree&#34; book I've purchased since I got my first Kindle a few years ago, and I would urge everyone to buy a printed copy.  You won't want to miss seeing these outstanding photos on the printed page, and you won't believe how beautiful they are compared to seeing them on a screen.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I like the book a lot. I guess I just wish it were easier to publish on Kindle. The book helps, but it doesn't make it SO easy that I don't need to read other books. A good start and necessary read for Kindle publishers.
0307352153|5.0|Fascinating book.  Easy to read but had lots of case studies and research to back up what she was saying.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in people, psychology, etc.  I keep mentioning it to my friends in conversation!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|2 1/2stars I'll probably read at least one more of the trilogy just to see if they get better, thank you.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Thank you for finally updating this app since to old version will not be working soon!!! It was frustrating to see update notice a the top of your Facebook only to be brought to Google play when clicked. I have checked Amazon several times for an updated version  finally got it today!!
0316074314|2.0|Any novel written in the 21st century that goes over 350 pages attempts to be a throwback to the Victorian era, when the reading public had much leisure time. Although this novel is beautifully written and apparently structurally innovative, I could not for the life of me go past page 196. At this point in the book I had become too overwhelmed (irritated maybe) by the unnecessarily detailed descriptive paragraphs to much care for the intricate plot developments. Catton keeps pouring it on to hammer in her literary and insightful talents; after a while, you would have to surrender and put the book down---for good.<br /><br />I'm sure this novel is enjoyable reading for many, and it deserves the praises and awards it receives, but for heaven's sake keep it simple--like minus 400 pages.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a fairly foolproof app (it must be, as I've not had any problems with it!!)<br />Even the free version has some customizable elements. It's very easy  to see, at a glance, how much welly is left in the battery.

B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Iron Man 3, Was a perfect, post Avengers Tony Stark/Iron Man adaptation. And, it was a great salute to Agent Stewart (Captain America's Girl whom, he left, when, he was Frozen for 70 years, in a place, to launch, her character, separately, or send her, Out of the Picture' with True Honor.) In Every way, the work, that went into the Iron Man 3, Motion Picture, was evident, because, they took the time, and put in the work, that made ten, improbable to impossible, Each and All, completely believable. Way to go IM3 Team!/Proj1man-Dr.Terrance R. Mills,Jr.,J.D.,P.h.D., and Thank You!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Loved watching it in the theater! Great addition to my DVD collection. Can't wait for the other movies! Robert Downey at his best!
0446572985|2.0|I have read a good number of action/spy/espionage/counter-terrorism novels.  I am amazed at the high ratings The Innocent has received.  The plot is so convoluted and complex that the wrap-up, where all is explained and loose ends tied up, is almost laughable.  The characters are more like superheroes than real people.  Our hero Will Robie is rescued from his seemingly certain-death confrontation with the bad guy at the end by events akin to &#34;Deus ex machina&#34; in the ancient Greek tragedies (where God descends from the heavens in a chariot to rescue the hero from his impending demise).  I regret wasting the time I spent reading this farce.
B009LDCXNY|4.0|I have been a long fan of the show and was happy when the 8th season came out. Love the gag reel!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The game is fun and very additive. I don't like the long commercials in between the different actions you try to do.
0765338149|3.0|Highly recommended by a friend.  Purchased prior to movie opening in November.  Good read in the beginning, slows down in the middle but is picking up again.  Do not think I will be continuing the series or any other books from this author due to his political leanings and rumored bigotry.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I really enjoy Family Farm Seaside, but the inability to connect to Facebook is annoying.  I want to spread the word to my friends,  but for some reason it won't Sync.  I hope it's fixed soon!
B008LXZFH6|1.0|...and thrown it off a boat in deep water.<br /><br />Stupid. Appeals to the 15 and under audience, sorry I let my 13 years olds  watch this drivel.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I love this movie it really funny and romantic. Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses and anything with her in it has to be good!
0399255370|3.0|My guess is some (or maybe most) of the glowing reviews are being generated by a PR firm hired by the publisher. I really wanted to love this book because my niece and I share of love crayons. But when I read the story I was a little surprised and disappointed at the language and stereotypes the crayons use to express their feelings. I'll admit I was hoping for something a little more creative/innocent in terms of their protest. Instead what I encountered was a lot of whining, some questionable/negative manners of expression and a few unimaginative stereotypes--basically attitudes I would not want to encourage in my niece or any other young reader. I will admit I was most offended by the use of the word 'HATE' (spelled in all caps) in a letter authored by the black crayon. If language like this is something you're OK with, then by all means don't let it get in the way of you and your little reader enjoying the creative and delightful drawings that accompany them. The illustrations are the only reason I have not returned the book.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|Oh My...I started to watch at night and had to pause twice, before I realized that this had to be watched in the daylight.  Scared the crap out of me.  Will be watching again very soon!
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Will Smith is one of my favorite actors.  He consistently makes me laugh, and sometimes (The Pursuit of Happyness) makes me cry.  I wanted to cry for a whole different reason with this movie.<br /><br />Smith seemed to be trying to channel Lawrence Fishburne's character in \\"The Matrix\\" throughout the entire movie.  It was like he couldn't relate to the character well enough, and was therefore ACTING with all the Master Thesbian intonation that word should have in this case.<br /><br />Smith's movies are good because of the humor he injects into them.  No matter how serious they are, a bit of him shines through.  None of that was present in this movie, and I realize the character was supposed to be very serious and cold, but then it should have been played by someone else.  It's not a part I enjoyed seeing Smith in, and I don't think it played to his strengths as an actor.<br /><br />As for Jaden, I love that kid.  I think he has real potential, and isn't just riding on the fact that he's \\"Will and Jada's kid.\\" For most of this movie though, you wouldn't have known it.  Maybe I just don't believe him as the scared, wimpy little kid.  He's been too strong in other parts for me to see this as him.  It wasn't until the end, where his character toughened up, that I believed him as the character.<br /><br />I won't even get into the plot holes, of which there were many.  The plot was one big hole, actually. Which is too bad because the premise was interesting and could have made a good movie.<br /><br />There was one part of the movie that I liked, and it came at the very end.  It was, I think, Jaden's final line in the movie.  It showed that seriousness wrapped in humor that I've come to associate with Smith's movies, and Jaden delivered the line perfectly.  I don't want to \\"spoil\\" the ending, so I won't say what it was, but I think if you watch the movie I think you'll know it.<br /><br />Do I recommend this movie?  No.  Not at all.  It's a waste of time.  Still, I haveseen all of Smith's other movies (I think) so I saw this one.  I wouldn't watch it again, and I hope there is never a sequel (it doesn't lend itself to one).

B001UW58WW|5.0|I absolutely LOVE his music!!! You can hear his passion in every note. I plan on purchasing more of his music.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|Whew where do I begin. After waiting impatiently for 3 years for IM 3 here goes:<br /><br />Firstly, I AM a comic fan so I am familiar with the Marvel universe. Secondly, this was the most OBNOXIOUSLY arrogant film I've ever seen. Shane Black completely RUINED the Avengers continuity--Oh no, not from me but from Joss Whedon himself!! Youtube it--<br /><br />This script had some good dialogue and ideas other than the obvious flaws that the Mandarin was a fake and ridiculous and Tony never wore the suit very much and when he did it would just fall off??(or the hero half the screen time fights unmasked). I'm tired of writers premising a plot that interferes with what the characters are ABOUT. Yes you can throw in the personal character conflict and STILL maintain the action as long as said action includes yep, you guessed it, Iron Man (since that IS the title of movie). I'm also sick of the writers always making our hero a 'bumbling incompetent buffoon' til the end of the movie when they finally 'save the day'. You want personal character conflict address Tony's alcoholism not his panic attacks.<br /><br />The Iron Patriot was useless. The Killian character was never developed--How did they attain their powers? (Yes I know it was from some mutant plant but really they exist...??? Wanna explain that a lil more???) Why did some of them spontaneously combust? Why was Killian actually the Mandarin?? How was the actor not spotted by his actor buddies and not exposed as a fraud??<br /><br />The female botanist character was COMPLETELY worthless and added NOTHING to the plot or in any help to Tony.<br /><br />The Christmas Carol character of 'Timmy' the antagonist was annoying and actually made me angry at him.<br /><br />Also, are you telling me ALL of Tony's suits are stored in his Malibu home? All in plain sight?? None in the basement of any of his probably other 20 locales he owns? Not 1??? Also he communicated with Jarvis the whole time why didn't he order up the robot army sooner?? WHY did it take days to charge his worthless suit?? WITH electricity. Why didn't Jarvis summon the Iron Patriot suit?? He can 'overide' all commands thus far...In a life or death situation WHY wouldn't he use a tried and true suit to insure your safety?? A squirrely malfunctioning prototype to protect you from a real threat??? Yeah that's a good idea...And no one thought to call the other Avengers?? At least Captain America?<br /><br />Are you also telling me terrorists needed Stark to publicly tell them his Malibu address to find it they couldn't GPS or google it themselves?? NOR was he in the LEAST prepared for said attack???<br /><br />The regeneration theme was better suited to an X Men movie, NOT Iron Man. IM should be about hi tech villains and gadgetry, not an army of Human Torches which could also be a Fantastic Four movie but I digress<br /><br />The little kid was in the movie because when Robert Downey makes appearances at Comicons the kids show up in droves to honor IM wearing their mini IM suits and IM gear pointing their pretend laser blasts from their hands at him (you can youtube this if you want to see it). I suppose this was homage/appeasement to their loyalty. This is also possibly why RD doesn't want to play the role of Tony Stark anymore.<br /><br />When Iron Man was flying 100 mph and hit the semi truck going probably 70 on the bridge and it knocks his suit off, Tony had to land on the pavement going at least 80--AND survives??<br /><br />This movie SUCKED on so many levels it makes Cat Woman look like Citizen Kane. When you have Thor, Captain America and The Avengers being taken seriously then you pull this kinda crap on us you should be sent to comic book HELL or at least made to watch Aliens or Predator or Jurassic Park OR The Avengers 10 times each to see a REAL action movie.<br /><br />This is what happens when Joss Whedon and Jon Favreau don't direct.<br /><br />I hope Shane Black NEVER works again.<br /><br />BTW, Iron Man 2ROCKED<br /><br />I also don't know why our president in 2013 (It is set in OUR current timeline) is STILL GW Bush??? Oh wait--to make our current regime look like bad guys in a movie would be racist gotta keep it old white guys they are the true villains in America right?? NOT our REAL bold face PROVEN liar of a president--<br /><br />--Liberal Hollywood at it's finest...<br /><br />3/1/14<br /><br />After seeing Thor: The Dark World is even MORE reason to hate Shane Black--Hey Shane you ever seen a comic book movie??? Or a movie for that matter coz you don't know d$%k about it. The director of Thor in the Marvel One Shot was desperately trying to UNDO what Shane Tard did to the Mandarin and continuity of the Avengers/Marvel Universe. Go youtube Joss Whedon giving Shane B crap as well.<br /><br />Letting Shane Black direct Iron Man 3 is like letting a retarded kid do a finger painting--You might like it, but it's NOT art.<br /><br />Shane Black is a MORON even his name sounds moronic<br /><br />AND this is an immature college effort that I give an F- and two thumbs DOWN<br /><br />6 8 15:  All Hail to the King at the end of Thor: The Dark World was an attempt to SAVE the disjointed mess Shane &#34;On Crack' Black made of Iron Man 3.<br /><br />What a LAY-HOO-ZERgime look like bad guys in a movie would be racist gotta keep it old white guys they are the true villains in America right?? NOT our REAL bold face PROVEN liar of a president--  --Liberal Hollywood at it's finest...  3/1/14  After seeing Thor: The Dark World is even MORE reason to hate Shane Black--Hey Shane you ever seen a comic book movie??? Or a movie for that matter coz you don't know d$%k about it.

Shane Black is a MORON even his name sounds moronic  AND this is an immature college effort that I give an F- and two thumbs DOWN  6 8 15:  All Hail to the King at the end of Thor: The Dark World was an attempt to SAVE the disjointed mess Shane &#34;On Crack' Black made of Iron Man 3.  What a LAY-HOO-ZER
B008JFUR10|2.0|The entire film is a fine bit of SFX and acceptable acting (no award winning  performances though). If you want a good action film, thats all this is. There's one and only one twist in the plot concerning the Kaiju (monsters) but the ending is so predictable that it's anticlimactic. I didn't realize I was watching Independance Day until the end and then it all added up. Rent it. Don't buy it.
B0041KYLAU|5.0|The movie is one that will never &#34;get old&#34;.  Very glad to have it added to our collection.  Popular with all ages.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price you can't beat it! I stream netflix/youtube from my phone(galaxy note2)/ipad/computer to my screens and can still browse the web. I'm actually streaming Netflix as I write this review! Once Google has the cast feature for their mobile browser this will be the keystone for whole-home entertainment.  Image quality is great. I stream to my 110\\" dlp 1080p projector screen and it is as clear as any other input I have. Web browsing on this screen is just unreal!<br /><br />There is no question about this product... Buy it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|first time trying this type of game.  some levels were a ltttle  difficult.  i just needed to get the hang of the system.
0553801473|5.0|I like watch the series on HBO.  I really love the story.<br />Thanks. Great Buy. Will definately look to do business again.
B0045HCJSK|5.0|Always a classic.  Gotta love John Wayne.  I used this as a prize give-away for a party.  Definitely a hit.  Thank you.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|Upside down was a visually intense movie. It looked really nice, but the physics they described were so off it made the movie hard to watch. It seemed as if someone just wrote down something that sounded scientific and thought it was good. That being said the story itself wasn't all that interesting. Boy loves girl, something happens they are pulled apart then they find each other. This movie just brushes conflict off in order to move forward. It seems like the harsh punishments they talk about don't exist. Needless to say by then end of the movie we were so bored of the repetitive story that we fast forwarded and made up our own words to make it more interesting.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|its so much fun and great to play, i loved how high def the picture wa and how bright the colors were!:)
B004HWYTP4|3.0|I am glad I watched it so I can watch Red 2 coming soon to DVD. Pretty decent flick. aya
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This book was hyped ad nauseum on Facebook and I had my book pre-ordered months ago.  Finally the day arrived and my Kindle was fired up.  Much to my displeasure the book disappointed me. While it had it's moments, it was no Shining. The end left me hanging.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I absolutely loved Sharp Objects. Murder, suspense, thrillers, and mysteries are typically books I don't read and am very picky about. The authors people rave about are typically my least favorite. I loved Gone Girl and a few people have recommended Gillian Flynn's other books to me, so I grabbed this on a sale table at Barnes and Noble.<br /><br /> Sharp Objects was so twisted. I love the tone and the voice of the narrator, Camille. Gillian Flynn has the ability to make her characters come alive on paper with all of their bitterness, complexity, complexes, issues, and personality. Camille was not just the bitter reporter cookie cutter character, but a real character with problems. When she was advised to head back to her hometown to cover a gruesome story, she reluctantly packed her bags and headed back to place she was happy to be away from.<br /><br /> The story sounds like your average murder thriller movie or book at first glance, but that's what makes Gillian Flynn so talented. She takes an otherwise basic plot and turns it on its head, adding dashes of horror, darkness, insanity, and psychosis. Camille was in town to figure out if the two missing girls were linked, but she also dealt with her own childhood and parental issues while she was in town. The town itself felt suffocating and dull as Camille ran into childhood friends, acquaintances, and their children. Ideas of right and wrong, normal and abnormal, and what sorts of things women should and shouldn't do were tossed around in the novel, which piqued my interest.<br /><br /> The town, the people of the town, the cops, and Camille herself had layers upon layers peeled back in Sharp Objects. For example, at first, the murder looked like two innocent and beautiful girls murdered in cold blood by what the police would assume was a sick man. But as the story progressed, the girls were less and less innocent and sweet, but more troublesome girls who danced to their own beats. And the profile of the killer didn't fit the elegant woman a child last saw one of the girls talking to. Suddenly, a clear cut case with a clear profile of a killer wasn't quite so clear. Nothing really made sense, which brought about questions from Camille about what women might be capable of.<br /><br /> I loved all of the layers and elements of Sharp Objects. Everything was complex. I highly recommend the novel. I thought the overall mystery was fairly easy to unravel later on the in the book, but I think most of that was due to be reading Gone Girl and knowing what sort of twists and directions the author is capable of. Had I not been aware, perhaps the mystery would have been less easy for me to solve. Still, though, it's an awesome and thrilling novel that is truly dark and haunting.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|Nice presentation but no live radar. Other wise there is no difference then the info you can get with other apps.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have had several compliments on the look of the phone . the price was great . I have no complaints .
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This is a really fun game. I like to play during my break at work or any other chance I get.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was very well written and difficult to put down. I laughed, I cried, I wanted to know & love the characters.<br /><br />I am an adult who was supposed to be previewing this book for a children's reading circle. I ended up reading the entire book.  I shared it with my son who is in 8th grade & he too go into it.<br /><br />Excellent read for all ages!
B008XBHBX2|5.0|Great movie - classic line: &#34;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&#34; Superb cast.  I still won't go in the water.
B004BLDD9Y|4.0|Purchased one to try and it worked fine. The price on LED lights seems to be dropping and wanted to try one. I like the LED light to the CFL bulbs which are slow to fully light and grow dime over time.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I simply cannot put this game down. Its so addicting lol<br /> I highly reccomend it. Much better than candy crush
B000002O1Q|1.0|I cant really say that I hate it because i liked the music, its just that I thought it was the movie I was buying.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Love Google.  Always has my top picks.  Much prefer over other search engines.  Seems that it less about promoting and advertising companies than the other engines, and more about the customers needs.
B00B8YSIMY|4.0|Lots of reviews here already, so I'll make this brief and try not to be redundant. Get Clean is definitely raw, dark, and in places downright dreary despite it's fabulous setting in Spain, but this is all part of what makes it chilling on so many levels. Although I've never been an addict or intimately known any, I've read tales and watched documentaries and movies depicting similar situations, so this seems spot-on. I don't know if this is a memoir or just brilliantly written in a style that makes readers believe the author walked a few miles in Jimmie Walker's shoes. As a fan of Breaking Bad, this gripping read somewhat helped me with withdrawal pangs --- see, we're all addicted to something in life.<br /><br />Jams created some memorable characters in this incredible plot that make me tag \\"Get Clean\\" an absolute Must Read!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this game will take a little bit for any LoL player to get used to, targeting is a little weird, but other than that great game! And it is free! so give it a try, much easier than carrying a laptop around!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It's been a while since I have seen such a well made science fiction movie.  Great Job.  Good acting. Great feel!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I bought this for my english class and cant wait to read it, especially since the movie is now coming out! super excited!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so awesome. It is challenging but lots and lots of fun. Though it should give you hints though out the game. I love it.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|What a great cute story, my Friends kids came and watched it and they all enjoyed the story. Along with all the Adults too :)
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This is a great video. I bought it for my grandchildren. The colors are bright and clear and the music is upbeat and gets the young ones dancing up a storm. They get into the story line and erupt with outbreaks of dancing and singing when the upbeat songs come on. Watching them enjoy this video is as entertaining for me as the movie is for them. After over a month they have not tired of this movie. They request it whenever they come over (which is almost daily).
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was slow moving and, at times, a little too \\"wordy.\\" Great story though - highly recommend. Will definitely read others by this author.
B0090X4GJE|3.0|I think some of the songs are damaged on the cd, but can't be sure since I can't tell if it's Ellie Goulding's voice vibrating or the song, since I am not familiar with all of her songs.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Excellent!  I couldn't put it down...funny and romantic.  Lovable characters with a great story line.  I absolutely loved the book!
034580404X|5.0|I had already read these books, but i wanted my own collection.  Looking forward to see how they do the movie.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|One of the better corporate profiles I have read.  Stone does a great job looking objectively at the rise of Amazon.  There are many interesting insights into Amazon's business model and corporate culture.  An all around great read for the those interested in Amazon or 21st century economics.
B00B596VB2|5.0|This model was a blast to put together. Bandai has been adding more and more detail to their model kits over the decade, and this kit has a lot of parts for a 1/144 model kit. the kit does not fall apart easily either, and is comparable build to an older master grade model kit. I recommend this if you like models that need no paint and snap together, but dont want to compromise on the quality of the finished product.
1476719071|5.0|Thanks Jamie for a beautiful book, and the cover and colouring is just so pretty.. I love this book it is one of my all time favourites..
B001GCUNW6|5.0|These movies are funny and family friendly.  Fun to watch and always funny.  Have watched on many family night movie nights.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|what else can i write about the review for a movie? its not like a product i can buy. all i can say is that this was a horrible movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and creative! The first time I played this on a friends tablet I was like wow I have to get this app!
B00DW1WR14|3.0|I am a longtime fan.  I heard this album on the radio last night in its entirety and was just plain disappointed.  There is a lack of energy here.  The music frequently lilts into bland, unimaginative interludes.  Ed's vocals really hit me hard at points, but there are other times when they are similarly unimaginative, droning, and lacking in some of the former punkish energy he brought to the harder rock tracks and the haunting soul he brought to their quieter or more acoustic tracks.  But most of all...TOO MANY BORING BALLADS.  Ed can really belt one out when he wants, but there is no heart and no charm in these vocals or lyrics, as well as in the backing music.  To my mind the clear highlight of the album is Track 6, &#34;Infallible,&#34; but the rest of the album just doesn't hold up.  My three stars - rather than two - is mostly because I'm predisposed to like PJ and because there were just a few really arresting moments, riffs, etc.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's good but it keeps telling me to post on Facebook and I have tons of achievement goals that are about posting on Facebook and its super super super super annoying
B001NLL93W|4.0|The story is captivating and very enjoyable to read. The author has created an amazing series of books. I love them.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Don't judge the app by its picture, it is actually surprisingly good for an app. Some pay to win issues but nothing to bad.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|Truly, truly and exciting to read this book. This was the so powerful and heart breaking novel that I have ever read. I connected with Tess and all of her problems. This is a just read for all.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|After 6 years it's good to listen from him. With this album he shows that he still has great things to offer and that his talent is permanent.
B0085RZAP0|1.0|I did not enjoy reading this book. It sooooo not engaging!  Something was left out, maybe the plot itself? or???
B00CLT31D6|5.0|I heard Dave Ramsey mention this book, and decided to check it out.  While it isn't &#34;in checklist form&#34; like Dave's books that I've read thus far, this book complements them well in that it helps you think through how to approach a situation where you may have building wealth--so that remains a blessing and doesn't become a curse on your family.  It is a little dated, but I still highly recommend it!
B00008WT5M|5.0|I purchased this CD because my boyfriend is a big fan of AC/DC. This is one of the few albums that he didn't already own, so it was part of his birthday gift from me. (It also helps that this is one of my favorite albums by the band, but I didn't tell him that).
B0071XO8RA|5.0|FIRSTLY, I am not a big fan of sci go, but was drawn to Wool by the reviews and the low price.  But, by the end of the first chapter I was hooked and voraciously read to the fulfilling end.  I do not want to throw out a spoiler, but let me just say that Wool is very well  plotted and written with excellent character development.  On the one level it is just a compelling story and on another level it is a metaphor for...well, read it and you figure that out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|If you love the original Oregon Trail game. You will love the game. The graphics are really good. It's fun for all ages.
B0016CVN02|4.0|It's frustrating that I ordered this album on my computer with the intention of listening to it on my Kindle Fire and my Android phone and it doesn't show up in the cloud on those devices.

B00C1CO0XS|5.0|George Benson has always been a step ahead of the class, as he so cleverly combined Jazz and R&B in the late 70's winning several of his 10 Grammy awards.  This time he has returned to his jazz roots in a very classic way.  This tribute to our other King is simply stupendous. George's vocal talent is immeasurable as he projects Nat's style while adding his own personal nuances.  He is accompanied on several tunes which adds even more diversity to this interpretation of these classic tunes and will make this a much sought after addition to any jazz lover's collection.  George is just \\"Classic to the Bone\\" and we love his latest effort to display his creative talents for our enjoyment.
B004GYY714|5.0|I use this app all the time.  So easy to use and couldn't imagine my phone with out it.  Nice to have the radio with me where ever I go.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|The grandchildren, ages 4-7, love this game. I never get to play as they are always playing for me. The little ones like freezing the floating pigs in space by puncturing their space helmets. There's something for almost any age.
B009NY43NY|5.0|i have seen alot of bad reviews for this book and i don t understand why. i thought that charlaine did a pretty good job at ending the series. she has always said that it was never her plan to turn sookie into a vampire so it would have made no sense for sookie and eric to stay together. there has always however been a little something between sookie and sam from the start. yes maybe it did take a little bit of fairy magic to make them see that but sometimes even in real life it can take a scare of losing someone before your ready to admit your true feelings for that person. i think that sookie and sam are a great couple and charlaine got it right. i also like how she brought back old enimies like steve newlin and really wrapped it all up there.  maybe theres not alot of guess work to this one but all and all it was a good finish to a great series.
B0061S0A64|5.0|As a closet composer, I was excited to find I could change the rhythm. Also use it as a soothing sound for falling asleep.
B009P3N1GI|5.0|Wow. This is definitely Sanderson's best work - by a long way. It has a poetry that most of his work lacks. If he keeps going in this direction he'll end up a master in the full sense of the word (not that he's bad by any measure at present).
B008OOYALE|4.0|its force closing even at the touch of opening the app. please fix it soon so that I and others are able to play without constant interruption :/)

B000FA5TTW|4.0|Really enjoyed it. Easy to read during daily commutes. Good character development and satisfying ending. I wonder how much the writer contributed to the movie...
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had so many twists and turns.  Because it was such a good read, I am going to check out the authors other books.
0545586178|5.0|Loved this book!!!' Just as great as the first one! I couldn't put it down for 4 hours. This one will surprise you leaving you wanting to immediately pick up the last book!
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|Most of it was fine, but the last disk was bad. The series was supposed to be &#34;like new,&#34; However, the last disk was not. It broke up and stopped frequently. It took approximately 45 min. to watch the last 15 min. of the last DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is not only fun and addictive, but also fair and rewarding. The sounds and voices seem licensed, an overall great game. Free helps too, has good trophies, that actually give in game bonuses.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I personally really enjoyed the album.  The only song I didn't really care for all that much was Hosanna for some reason, but I loved all the rest of them.  They all have an uplifting sound to them!  Buy the album, you won't regret it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|OK.  I had no idea who this author is, but I'm waiting on the next Diana Gabbledon book and I've read the others a million times.  Amazon suggested Wool and over 1,000 reviews can't be wrong, right?<br /><br />A silo.  My initial thoughts:  Super far-fetched.  A cleaner:  Who's gonna do that knowing the outcome?  Halfway through the book:  How's this guy gonna tie all this together?<br /><br />So, I couldn't put it down.  My family thought I'd abandoned them.  It turned from far-fetched to believable to I-hope-that's-not-what-happens-to-us.  Howey shows a story about the big guys controlling the little guys but it's more than that.  It's what people will believe if given enough rules and fear.  Thanks to the author for not being heavy-handed on the romance.  If I want a bodice ripper, I will seek out Danielle Steele (bleh).  I've never read a story even close to this one.  Matrix is the closest I can think of, but the premise is definitely different.  I read the second book and am now beginning Dust.  Cheers to an author and summary I wouldn't have even considered (I normally like historical fiction) if not for Amazon's suggestion.

B00C1OQRPU|5.0|This is a masterpiece of human folly and  a  critic of  Victorian era hypocrisy. Dr. Jekyll  a talented , good looking and wealthy man was unable to deal with and or judiciously restraint his fun-loving nature . Instead, he invented an imperious and grave mold of personality for himself to remain on par with the men of his high social status. His infuriated and in bondage &#34;Self&#34; was replaced by his  animal &#34;ID&#34;  and confronted and shattered that artificial&#34;Mold&#34; and finally leading to the destruction of all. At the last moments of his life, Dr. Jekyll  personality seriously weighed his two final options;  criminal and  un-discerning  Mr. Hyde' s  absolute freedom versus  stoic  but productive life of his mold  and he decided to choose the latter, but alas, it was too late.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|I have been fascinated by some of the Internet pioneers and in my opinion Jeff Bezos ranks at one of the highest positions. Probably only others who are at this league are Steve Jobs and Bill Gates in terms of the effect on the modern Internet society. Bezos is intriguing as he is not well known to the public and there are no comprehensive biographical sketches. This book has shed immumerable lights on Amazon as a company and on Jeff as a person and his management style. I have been buying from Amazon for past 15 years and is fascinating to see its progress. I commend the author Brad Stone for taking so much time to research and put together a wonderful book.<br /><br />The book does not answer why Jeff Bezos has the most infectious roaring laugh. The roaring laugh one associates with Bezos. Family does not have an answer, but some ex colleagues have. The reasoning is almost counter intuitive, but it sheds into the minds of Bezos. It delves into the interview techniques used at D E Shaw where Bezos worked which Amazon adopted. Some of the ratings are still being practiced at Amazon. Some of the questions asked at Amazon early on e.g., How many fax machines are in the US, gives insight into how candidates think. I am fascinated how Bezos as a geek did not like LaTex, one of the most popular text processing software written by an academic giant Don Knuth of Stanford University. Bezos says, it is not easy to use and brushed aside early on. Well that is true, but it baffles why he said that. Of course Microsoft Word is WYSIWYG. Bezos was hooked to numbers and had awesome insights - a trait for entrepreneur; sometimes he was right, sometimes wrong. He saw a 2300% growth on Internet and hence convinced himself to start Amazon. The book has the one of the first job postings of Amazon in a usenet bulletin board posting in 1994. Seeking C/C++/Unix developer, which is still very much valid 20 years later. Amazon's original names are fascinating. Interesting to note relentless.com still redirects to Amazon. This shows Bezos attachment to his early names!<br /><br />The book goes back and forth between Amazon's early stories, Bezos's personal life and the companies management techniques. Bezos had told investors in early days he projected $74 million in sales in 2000, but actual sales were $1.64 Billion. This and other early day anecdotes show how no one predicted Internet growth. Bezos's childhood days are well captured from the Vanguard program for gifted children at River Oaks Elementary School.<br /><br />One of the most dramatic part of the book is similar to Steve Jobs personal story. The author traces Jeff Bezos's biological father  --- --------- This story is riveting and it begs the question How does fate decides one's life. I really hope the author got permission of Jeff Bezos to publish this piece. Is it a good journalism to expose someone's personal life in this book. Could Jeff himself have tracked his biological father and chose not to do so intentionally? These are moral and ethical questions..<br /><br />At the end book at core is about Amazon's vigorous customer advocacy. Amazon has branched into so many areas like Amazon Web Services, a completely digital. The way new hires are inducted into the company says the core philosophy. HAVE backbone. Disagree and Commit. An awesome appendix with list of excellent management books is also present. The pictures are priceless! I highly recommend this book as one of the best biographical sketch of Amazon and of its creator. What lies ahead of Amazon in next 50-100 years is anybody's guess. I wish the author Brad Stone does a similar book on Amazon and Bezos after 20 years and call it version 2.0.com still redirects to Amazon.

B005LAIHPE|5.0|I loved it! Great twists and turns, and does an excellent job of combining real elemennts with a great Sci-Fi action/adventure story.Not to be missed. Really!
B004SKJTY6|1.0|One would think they were getting the full movie, but it's not the movie, only a trailer.  This was very disappointing.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|An excellent yarn, and one where the WW-2 incident makes it plausible, yet set in the present, not 1943. Great entertainment for the whole family.

Ridiculous and tiresome.<br /><br />Too many situations that don't seem possible, given the history of the characters.<br /><br />I will say that the chapter titled The Owl made me weep.  However, it doesn't rescue the overall story.

B00DJWV11I|4.0|This book was sexy and incredibly funny.  Told from the male's perspective of an arrogant and confident man who finally finds a woman to make him drop to his knees.  Loved it.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|The story was really good, and funny. Best animated movie that I have seen. The animated action was perfectly done and at times looked pretty realistic.<br />OK. It is not Avatar but it was not meant to be. No. It has its own personality.

After trying to charge it  for about 2 weeks, I called the help desk and was  so pleased with the person who helped me. He got straight to the problem and knew right away  how to resolve it. Thank you so much
B00DI75SWM|4.0|I like this app it's fun and cool but I wish there were more colors or able to make your own but it's really cool
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's was just as adventurous and eventful  as the preceding books.<br />I recommend  this read to anyone who likes romance strong female leads and adventure.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was riveting.  From the desire to learn the secret to the inevitable ending of life coming full circle.<br />I could not put it down.
B00E3BK0QQ|2.0|This game took forever to download. It hardly explains any way to proceed. There are other games that downloads easily, flows, better graphics and instructions.
1250038820|5.0|This book makes my heart skip a beat.  What a fantastic piece of unpretentious art by a Georgia native.  I truly believe that something this genuine couldn't have been accomplished without his innate Southern humility. Thank you, Brandon!  You make us proud.  P.S. Goooooooooooo dawgs!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I was a little upset that it did not carry over from the last season AT ALL. They only used some of the old characters from the last season but the daughter is not in it and neither is the mother.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I loved the old songs with a jazz-like rendition of them.  Paul has a sound that is right on key and I love the song he wrote for his wife.  I saw the show on PBS and wanted to have the music on CD.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Love it. My seven year old son loves it! It is hilarious and something great for the whole family to watch. My husband enjoys it too.
B00D3NSDVO|3.0|A true test of a thriller is when you force yourself to read that one more chapter when you should be sleeping. It isn't a classic by any stretch, but it did it's job and was a very entertaining read.
B005DJREJS|5.0|was real funny, the best I have seen in a while, will watch the next season. I really liked her mom!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love logic puzzles but usually get bored with them as they can be monotonous.  Not so with this one -- I was bummed when I finished it in 5 by 5 mood as well as 10 by 10. Writing this review to get the free painting!
B006BFK5DK|5.0|I love the creative sound  of instruments and nature which is epic in this whole production. A very great album!
B004HD61KE|4.0|As I've said in the past, these stories are just plain fun. The formula gets a little redundant, thus I quit giving them 5 stars, but they are well written and enjoyable world hopping adventures.
0307949508|5.0|Casablanca II.<br /><br />Or how about The Bible II.<br /><br />Ironically great writing is typically what makes sequel writing so hard. When you have a first product that is so singular and fantastic, a follow up usually fails because -- being naturally compared to the original -- it oftens fails in comparison to the original.<br /><br />Happily, such is not the case here with this page turning follow up to Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. To my eye, in some ways this book is actually even better than original. I say this for several reasons:<br /><br />1) Readers get more face time with Lisbeth Salander, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo herself who was clearly the most interesting character from the original book.<br /><br />2) Readers also get introduced to another enigmatic and fascinating character. No spoil alerts here. I'll leave readers of this fine book to make this happy discovery for themselves.<br /><br />3) Readers are treated because the story, though undoubtedly cerebral, involves a lot more action.<br /><br />4) And unlike the first story, you don't need to page back to a geneology at the front of the book sometimes to follow the action (something I sometimes found a bit difficult given the fact the characters all had Swedish names that I wasn't accustomed to reading or keeping straight in my mind).<br /><br />Make no doubt about though even though this book is better than the first one, the first was still great which makes this one even greater.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoy this book and the rest of the series.  They are good reads.  Made into a movie but must read the books to get the details that you are missing.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this game is an extremely fun \\" clue \\" type game. Follows a better story line than most hidden object games. I recommend it to all hidden object fans.
0399255370|1.0|Poor Duncan, a boy with an incomplete box of, mostly, whiny crayons.  Doesn't Duncan have enough to worry about already?  Duncan lives in a world populated solely by white people as seen in his coloring books and drawings.  His brown crayon is missing, and the rest of the box, except for green, can't stop grousing about their jobs.  Judging by the coloring books that Duncan's parents give him, I think they stole the brown crayon AND all the diversity from his world.  Book seems like it would be clever, but is just depressing and oddly, without color.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Thank you...it is so helpful. It is a great way to organize all those links I love and use. It also has been a great resource of info. Oh, and yes, I have done quite a few recipes that I have found and they come out perfectly! Thank you pinterest!
B00CB4FHNI|3.0|My expectations for this album didn't really match the outcome. Maybe it's my fault- I liked the first album so much that I thought they'd take what was great about Opus Eponymous  and expand on that...In way they did just that- just not in<br />the way I expected... Take a song like \\"Year Zero\\" which is a great track- takes what's great about the first record and expands upon on with choirs, synths, & orchestral bells and chimes... But with this new found need to experiment with choirs and bells & whistles something about the songwriting seems diminished, perhaps even more noticeable is the lyrical content.<br />Now, you could argue that the first record had a bit of a hokey quality - but those things can be overlooked with the right delivery and a strong command on tempo but when things start slowing down- take a song like \\"Ghuleh/ Zombie Queen\\"- where the first half feels slow paced and it feels painfully obvious that either one of those \\"nameless ghouls\\" is penning lyrics knowing how goofy they come across. Painfully slow piano opens to \\"GGGHHHHULLLLEHHHHH\\"- really? It's not sinister- it's just...funny.<br />It's like putting all the ridiculous imagery and putting it under a microscope...in the wrong tempo...Luckily, it's only in places I found myself cringing. At points, I found myself thinking this was a decent record only to sorta underwhelmed by tracks like \\"depths of satan's eyes\\" - luckily it's really only 3 or 4 tracks that I hated, mostly this album is good. I found the production to be really disappointing considering their newfound major label status- and Nick Raskulinecz' status as being a great sound producer/ engineer-er. To be fair- a lot of this simply suffers from the loudness wars which reached to absolulely ridiculous levels with Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\" album. Still a fan of these guys, I wait for their next album. Just wish they'd tone down the silly \\"we love the devil\\" motif even just slightly...C'mon guys really? You can't be serious...Maybe that's the point...and I'm just ironically impaired...<br />Yes, what some have said about these guys I agree with- take a little bit of Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, Merciful Fate (although it's a little less on this one more on the first one), - mix a little bit of gothic overtones and you have somewhat<br />of an idea as to what they sound like...<br />Favorite tracks: \\"Year Zero\\", \\"Mons trace Clock\\" (A creeper of a song), LOVE their Abba cover \\"I'm A Marionette\\" (how weird is it that the most metal moment is a flippin' Abba cover?), and for some reason \\"Body and Blood\\".
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The title is all I can really say. The game is only ok though I play just when I'm bored. it's not that great
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Very easy to use.  While I may never be able to speak it fluently I will be able to understand and read another language with daily use of this app.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|I highly recommend this game, it has amazing gameplay with decent graphics. 5 stars because the idea is cool and the game is addicting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The convenience of having the Bible at your fingertips in today's society is GREAT! I may not be able to pull out a hard bound copy of the Bible but I can surely scroll on my devices so that I may continue to read God's written word penned by man.
B000001FHV|4.0|If you're thinking about getting this album, get it. Its pretty original. This is easily one of the best albums made in my opinion. If you enjoy pretty original alternative, this is the album for you. I'd also recommend their earlier releases as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. Time seems to escape me while I play. I enjoy watching my daughter problem solve to gain the Star rating.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Loved it but felt it was too short; you don't want any of the Stackhouse books to end.  Hoping there will be another one very soon.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Love this show!!  Excellent writing, great acting, and for its time and place in history it's an instant cult favorite.
B001BANK32|5.0|I haven't read this since it came out years ago. I wanted to re-read it before I read Doctor Sleep. I didn't remember some of the parts, so it was a good read. This novel was well written, kept my interest, and it was hard to put down. I always get absorbed in Stephen King 's novels; I love novels that I get so involved in. I look forward to starting the sequel.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is a very talented writer, one of my favorites  His stories flow easily and have characters the reader learn to care about while I learn about another culture. This book took my interest quickly and I loved the book until about the last quarter, which did drag for me. I am not sure why as it wraps up the loose ends and has character updates.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|I have seen Al Di Meola live twice in the last 1.5 yrs and I am now a huge fan of his unique style of acoustic guitar playing. His masterful performances, his evocative interpretations, his signature layered compositions, all leave me speechless and wanting more. His music is sound poetry. The CD \\"All Your Life\\" lives up to all of this and more.<br /><br />I bought this CD mostly because it is signature acoustic Al Di Meola, secondly because it is interpretative Beatles music. Frankly, he could interpret anyone and I'd buy it. In this CD, Di Meola's acoustic brilliance adds exciting narrative overlays to the original fab four melodies.<br /><br />As a bonus not mentioned often, the CD can be enjoyed by all tastes - from sophisticated guitar aficionados to the uninitiated, from people like myself who are jazz/world music lovers to others who are new to these wide-ranging genres.<br /><br />Buy the CD, you won't be disappointed.
B00FHNBDC4|4.0|I need to give this one several more listens to properly evaluate whether this is a four or five star album. For now we'll stick with four as a first impression.<br /><br />I spent an afternoon at the car dealer listening to this while the service department worked on our Toyota. It is one of my least favorite places in the world, but the time just flew by, thanks to Amos. I'm sure more than one person wondered why I was grooving in my chair, but it is simply not possible to listen to Amos Lee and sit still. Tricksters, Hucksters & Scamps caught my attention, as well as Stranger and Dresser Drawer. But it's a good listen from beginning to end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|TFIOS is a wonderfully written story that in my opinion should be read by every teenager because not only is it a wonderful love story but also it deals with something that many people are reluctant to discuss with teenagers - death. The book is about people living with cancer so if you didn't already assume someone will die, you should make it a point to understand foreshadowing, John Green does a wonderful job explaining death and everything that encompasses it in a way that is both philosophical and entertaining, you learn an important life lesson without actually realizing you have learned it until you close the back cover and sit there in shock for a few minutes.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love it! Fun yet no so hard that you give up. Slowly builds  up in the challenge. I recommend it to people that like Making!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun hard but not too hard good app to kill time while sitting around with nothing better to do
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is fun but most of all it really is challenging, unlike other games that have easy to find objects this game makes you use your brain.
1444777556|5.0|I loved James and Bob in the first book, and I knew I wanted to read more.  I hope there is a third book soon to continue the wonderful adventures of this man and his special cat!
B008EKMB82|4.0|A fascinating look at different cultures, their effect on behavior and the examination of the concept of time. Read it!
B00452VF4O|5.0|Rather than review this series piecemeal, please see my, still in process, review under The Reckoning.  If you have read Here Be Dragons, you already know that you will be hooked for the third.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was very well written.  Lots of big words, maybe too large for teens.  Some interesting incites about life and death, here and now and why.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good science fiction with a focus on the social impacts of a not so rosy future.  No technology or space travel.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I really like this movie, which in my opinion, is the best summer movie this year by far.<br />The special effects are flawless and the action starts right away and didn't really let up all the way to the end.<br />The director's cut only extend a few seconds of extra scenes in the end that did not change the story line from the theatre release at all.<br />The 3D disc I bought is more than satisfying my need.
B00003CXRM|5.0|It's gotta be some sort of karma that I get to write the 1000th review for this film, because it's simply my favorite movie of all time. And as for the music - don't even get me started.<br /><br />I'll admit right now that I'm biased because 1: I grew up in the south. 2. I grew up listening to true tales summoned from the photographic memory of my southern granddad - a man who sipped homemade scuppernong wine, could hunt, farm and fix anything, ran a cotton gin, a pharmacy, and worked as a rural letter carrier and later a postmaster in Treutlen, County, Georgia. He was a truly great southern storyteller who grew up during the depression and his stories of southern situations - sometimes hilarious, sometimes horrific - are exactly the sorts of tales that permeate the bleak, beautiful and sepia-tinted southern gothic world of Oh Brother Where Art Thou.<br /><br />If you know or understand something of the south between the Confederacy and modern times, then you'll have an easier time appreciating the sometimes subtle and often obvious genius that permeates this entire film. If you know nothing of the south, you'll hopefully, simply appreciate a rollicking good retelling of Homer's \\"The Odyssey.\\"<br /><br />Nuff said.
1401938906|5.0|Clever, intelligent, inspiring! Have already recommended this book to family, friends, and clients.  Thank you Pam Grout for delivering a persuasive compilation of stories, considerations, and well-crafted reasons to wake-up and better direct our power! Highly recommended!

B0067R0APK|4.0|I have gone through different weather apps, including the Weather Channel, but Accuweather is the on I keep coming back to. The Weather Channel app is too cartoonish, but Accuweather has the data I need in a straightforward, easy to read, manner.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|This book was great.  Perhaps not the most well written but very engaging with deep character developement and plenty of intergue.  Can't wait for the next book in the series.  If you liked The Wheel of Time and Brandon Sanderson's previous books this will be right up your alley.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Interesting tale with some predictable and not so predictable twists. I liked the way the author wrote the epilogue. Made me second guess some events in my past.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American Horror Story: Asylum strikes a chord that most of us would prefer never happened.  The treatment of our mentally ill during the age of the &#34;snake pit&#34; included all of the atrocities displayed in this series.  A fresh look at a horrifying mental hospital.  The second series of a (so far) three part venue - the Asylum kept me looking forward to each weekly installment.  If you like horror you will like the Asylum.
B00BGI086Q|3.0|Take some Robin Hood. Sprinkle on a little Hamlet, a touch of King Arthur and you get this bit of drivel.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Ne'er do well rich kid Oliver Queen is shipwrecked on an Island for five years after the family yacht capsizes. His dad was \\"lost\\" in the wreck. But dad entrusted him with a notebook full of names of a lot of the wealthy folk of Starling City who used their wealth to gut the city and turn it into toilet. Oliver is rescued and vows to fulfill his dad's wishes to do the bad folk in and save the city.<br /><br />I'm amazed at all the high ratings this received from users. I suppose, that in this day and age, when most Americans see how corrupt their government, and big business are. And how hopeless they feel that they want to root for someone who will cut the red tape and get things done for them. This is a truly decent idea, but it's done so poorly. First off, lets look at the casting. There are almost no character faces anywhere. Nearly everyone is absurdly pretty or handsome. Then there's the writing. With the advent of shows such as \\"The Killing\\", \\"The Bridge\\" and \\"Breaking Bad\\" TV writing has improved exponentially over the last few years. So what happened here? Too much of this is on the level of daytime soap operas. And in the story, certain parts of the back story unfold over the episodes. This is a good thing. But there is little consistency with the characters. Each one of them does or says something mean or stupid to one of the other characters only to turn around a couple of scenes later and apologize. That gets old real quick. Oliver's sister is a great example. One minute she's sweet and understanding to her long lost brother, the next she's cutting him a new one. And this happens over and over.  Same with the directing. There are a lot of (too many)  tight head shots during the dialogue sequences. Who does that anymore?<br /><br />As of this writing more than 700 people have reviewed this. The only reason I'm doing so isto help balance things. I've sat through 8 episodes and the last two I struggled to finish because this just isn't that good. I do like the idea. It just needed much better handling.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I'm at the tiger shark and I'm about to get the great white shark!!!! This game is recommended for<br />everyone to play so get it now for those who don't!!!!!!!

B000BH4YJ0|5.0|Through his words you can enjoy his fabulous music, and learn a little Spanish at the same time!  Just remember, repetition, repetition, repetition.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|...I set it up and tried it out.  It is rather limited in the sources (YouTube, Google Play, etc.) you can use, but I don't expect that to last for long.  There is a slight delay when you initiate the streaming, but once it started I had no stuttering, pauses while buffering, etc.  The resulting video was in HD and looked completely fine.<br /><br />I only wish I could display my own pictures and whatnot via this device without jumping through hoops to do it.
B003OBJV5W|4.0|Nice to see them together up there on stage.  However, looks like they called in the performance.<br />However, I put all that aside, as after 30+ years performing, I imagined they are entitled to cruise through<br />their music catalogue.  Time has taken little toll on their voices. It was a pleasure......
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This book defines sacrifice and the high price of freedom. It brings comfort in a time of turmoil knowing these men still exist in this country. God bless Marcus Lutrell!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I adore this model so much. At first I was iffy about getting it but once I saw the price, I saw that it was worth it. Changing the limbs and face can be scary at first but once you've done it you see that it's not so bad. I absolutely love the bonus crying and winking faces that it comes with! I would love to get the rest of the team as well.
B000C20VPA|4.0|I'd say this is practically as good as Goodfellas.  The acting is top notch.  The shots of vegas are very nice.  The movie even has some comical relief at times.  It was more violent than I thought for some reason.  The ending was the only thing that confused me a little bit.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|Really impressed with this model. To see it in person you can really appreciate the details that went into it. Don't be hung up on whether or not to buy it if you consider it, you won't be disappointed.
B002JH3TW8|4.0|I am pleased with this adapter. Back before I had my Canon 60D I still used tape media and since I have an apple computer I needed to get my footage off my camera. So it did the trick.

0440241413|5.0|The series of Becky Bloom is just AMAZING!!!! I have the six books, and every now and then I read them again, just because they are delightfull: funny, sweet, exciting, moving, heartbraking and heartwarming. I highly recomend all of them! It´s a story about relationships: family, friendship and love. It´s among the best books I have ever read in my life, and I am a big reader:)
B00DANTYYC|5.0|The Eagles are on this recording and in concert were very enjoyable. If you like the Eagles, you will like this recording.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|Kudos for the Smith Father and Son team in what could have been a Top Rated movie if it was not for the poor directing of M. Night Shyamalan. It looks like any script that Shvamalan touches becomes Toxic--with a capital &#34;T.&#34;<br /><br />Producing the movie in 3D &#34;may&#34; have helped to conceal the bad directing, too.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Must not have paid enough attention when this movie was being marketed as I was thinking &#34;aliens.&#34; But I liked it. I like zombie movies, too, and this is no Walking Dead. These zombie's haul butt. Brad Pitt does a good job. Don't like his politics, but have nearly always liked his acting.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Read with my 10 year old son and husband. Really loved it! Highly recommend for those who have family that served.
B001YOYVK6|4.0|If Mickey Rourke is in a movie you can pretty well guess it is different. Definitely the case here. And if you remember the Cosby Show, one of the girls from that series has a role in this movie that will change your image of her. Harsh, dark and coarse, but enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|what a riot...love this game!  not really meant for little children but awesome fun for adults. very addicting and hard to put down. lots of fun in trying to beat your own score!
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Wonderful screenplay, actors--and I don't know how they did the battle scenes.  Very well done all around.  Story demonstrates connection between their century and ours.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This is a great little movie for so many reasons. Pixar is the best. Sorry they are owned by Disney.
B00006JIA4|5.0|It's Queen with Freddie Mercury front-lining.  The collection features a lot of their greatest music.  This was a birthday gift for my mother, and she loved it.  How could you expect it to be anything but great?

0345803485|5.0|Great!! Received the book before the due date!! Good read, its a very interesting story line with great characters for sure.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King does it again! King has this way of making the most outrageous concepts, suspending belief and presenting it as true life. His characters are deep, many layered, and real. He also has a knack for weaving in his other novels and stories into the new one. If you're a King fan this provides continuity between novels.

B0015DWLD0|3.0|The novel is just OK.  I had a hard time believing in the main character, he did not seem to behave as I would have thought he would, given his upbringing in poverty in India.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Easy to access and view and review. Missed original broadcast and this was the easiest way to view the show.
0374275637|5.0|Not a book you can expect to finish quickly! Really makes you think and think and think.  Some fascinating questions to consider sprinkled liberally throughout the book to show the points he's making. I'm more aware of my biases and the ease of jumping to faulty conclusions now, and my thinking processes will reflect this in my &#34;watercooler discussions&#34;.<br /><br />How I wish that this were required reading for all Members of Congress and in fact anyone entering the political scene - to keep them thinking through their decisions more carefully.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|My mom and I went to see this today.  I actually had no clue what it was about.  I have heard it was good.<br /><br />Before the review, a few things.  If you are one who has motion sickness.  I would not see this movie.  I never get bothered by stuff moving around a lot.  But many times, while watching this movie, I started breathing really fast and my heart started beating faster.  It gets intense.  If you are one who needs a lot of stuff happening, this may not be for you.  Do not get me wrong, there are things happening.  But it is all set within a single area.  The camera never gets to far from the characters.  It does when they are in space, but when they are in the ship, it is very close to them.<br /><br />There are movies in which a killer is in the woods and you must escape through all the hazards in order to find safety.  There are movies in which you are in a ship and must find land before massive storms destroy you.  There are movies in which one is abused and must find the courage within themselves to find safety.  All of those situations are dangerous and if you do not give your all, you will not survive.  Now, if you will, imagine you are in a place in which there is no air, no land, no possible way to survive unless EVERYTHING works to the exact degree that it was intended.  Welcome, to Gravity.<br /><br />This is really a psychological movie.  It is about a person or people who with no contact, hardly any movement and all the odds against them having to find a way to live.  Sometimes they will realize that they have to do things differently, in order to live.  They may give up, only to have something happen that makes them realize they should and can survive, by using that which they have learned.  There are times in the movie in which the people will be outside the shuttle.  Due to something happening, debris is coming towards the ship.  When you see it, you will get very tense.  Then they are climbing on the stuff, trying to get to a location, you will feel tense.  It is very nerve racking.  There are no more than four people in this movie.  I do not want to give anything away.  But I just wanted to let people know that this is not a movie with a lot of back and forth.  It is almost like I am Legend.  There are things that bothered me in this movie.  Things that happened that really did not make much sense.  The very end is a bit odd as well.  After everything that happened, it just did not seem like a big enough ending.  But, I will buy this movie.  I can only imagine how intense this will be if I watch it at home.

1401201911|5.0|I will always be a Batman fan first and foremost, so if you are a Superman fan you might not agree. This comic was amazing--it was interesting, a little heavy-handed, a little overstated and PC, but the story was wonderful, poignant, and ends in a way that is simply more beautiful than you could imagine.
0316204366|2.0|I have to give Mr. Gladwell credit: he’s developed a pretty good franchise, and a winning business / publishing formula: (1) develop an interesting sociological thesis that can be distilled into a short/punchy title; (2) identify a number of interesting stories of (mostly unknown) people and situations that support the thesis, and that readers will enjoy sharing at dinner parties; (3) gently weave the stories together in a straightforward and accessible manner, letting the patterns reveal themselves, and then; (4) end it quickly after about 300 pages, but with lots of notes to substantiate it.<br /><br />The only problem with eating at the same franchise too often, is the food starts to lose its appeal. Such is the case with David and Goliath, his fifth restaurant…er book.  The topic is interesting, but the stories are far too long-winded and at times the connection to the thesis feels tenuous.  This book is not as engaging as his earlier books, which I more wholly enjoyed, and feels like a bit of a contractual obligation.  The sub-title “…the art of battling giants” particularly intrigued me, as I was hopeful that there’d be some useful strategies or tactics to be used in battling my own giants. Sadly, that’s not the case.  Dyslexia and parental death aren’t great strategies. Other books, such as Negotiating with Giants, or Judo Strategy, do a much better job of providing specific, practical strategies for getting what you want from much larger, more powerful counterparts. So if you’re looking for more science and less art, don’t stop at the franchise with the frizzy-haired owner. Try something else.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Had watched the movie and the book is just as delightful. Yes there is differences but it was a very delightful read which made for pleasant reading on a boring weekend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great way to relax while keeping your brain active! It makes to think and reason... Can get addictive :)  Can't wait to play more!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|INCREDIBLE!!! This film hits every emotion square on the nose.<br />NICK NOLTE HOLY CRAP... you killed it in this performance.
B007HO392S|5.0|Awesome love I will see you soon very meaningful , great rhythm  on other songs would buy this album any time
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Incredible games. These games are what I consider art. If your looking for a lot of fast action or killing, then look elsewhere. These games will make you care about the characters.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|I just finished watching all 192 episodes of 24. This was a project that took a lot of time but worth it. I am not sure why I missed it when it was on TV but I am glad it is available on DVD and I have been able to watch it on my own time. Likely I would have missed episodes when it was on TV. The series had great and weak seasons. I think season 1 and 8 are great. The 5th is exceptional. They say season 6 was weak. I guess so but you can see they still put a lot into it. I can see the complaints about torture. Some of it is very violent and gruesome. I think the use of chemical torture was really uncomfortable to watch. This also reminds me of how many have been complaining that Zero Dark 30 endorses torture. I don't think it did nor do I think 24 did. But, that is my opinion. What I do think was representable was their suggestion that those who are Muslims or Middle-Eastern are terrorists. They fixed that in the later seasons, especially season 8.  In any event I found Kiefer Sutherland to be electrifying throughout every season. His relentless energy and ability to emotionally and physically act at that level is astonishing. He is a great actor. There were many others I greatly admired especially the weird and wonderful Mary Lynn Rajskub. She became a important part of the show. She seemed never comfortable with herself. Her strange expressions were what made her priceless. I guess my regret is that they killed off so many and some in the same seasons. I never got why they did that. Jack had a lot of great, beautiful women but the poor guy could never get a break. Bad things happened to the three that really meant something. I thought of all of them that Annie Wersching as Renee Walker was breathtaking. I also wish to point out that back in 2001 the show had black president. Not just any black president but a commanding Dennis Haysberth in that role. Then in series 7 and 8 they had Cherry Jones as the first female president. I think that is very interesting and significant. Does anybody but me think Cherry Jones looks a little like you-know-who? Well, they say it will come back in a limited series in 2014. What will Jack be up to?  Where did he go?  Who will be his next female conquest only for the relationship to go wrong?  I cannot wait.
B005LAII80|5.0|Lots of action and a movie I consider to be better than the original from the 90's. 3D effects are very good and made the movie even better but it's still a good movie in 2D.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This was made for anyone not in a hurry. I really like the slow pace of this game. Also<br /><br /> the challenge.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I was having way too many problems with youtube.com , but then I downloaded this app and its been smooth sailing ever since. I would definitely recommend this app to anyone having problems with youtube.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was selected as a book for our book club. I do like books written with bouncing timelines. The characters are unlikable. The setting boring. Two thumbs down.
B0035QUXWQ|4.0|This movie is a classic .  Keep true and honest to yourself and your life will fall into place &#60;3
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Finally a story line not about reality..someone can actually use there imagination still...loved it..everyone should watch this that loves sci-fi or that likes something not about reality..
B005GG0MIS|4.0|But a little pedestrian with subject matter.  Each is more like a well-researched college paper (maybe it was), but the information and presentation is well worth the reading.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Unexpected and exciting movie! Fast Zombies are even more scary! I dont really have 10 more words! Worth the watch.
B000HF6XV8|4.0|I thought this was a movie from my childhood but I'm not sure if this is it.  It was still a good movie none the less
B000B2YR8I|5.0|Its Shaun of the Dead what do you want me to say??? I used my last replacement case for this movie and I was ok plastic case the psp movies sit in was scratched
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love the game just wished the energy built up a bit faster. Once I started playing, I knew I was addicted.
B000HRMCTI|4.0|I skipped thank god I had an extra case good movie ONE OF ADAM SANDLERS BEST FOUR MORE WORDS REQUIRED
B00000DHTF|5.0|Its great. Espectacular!!! I wish i had bought it before. I can not stop listening the second disc. I recommend it to all Bruce fans
B00311G2C0|5.0|Got this movie brand new but it must have slipped out sadly had to replace the case oh well no more empty cases PEOPLE PLEASE BY REPLACEMENT CASES  CASED CLOSED
B008602KQI|5.0|A good world structure about the future possible world, and reasonable and interesting! The actress plays quite well and depicts a brave girl as alive! Excellent movie !
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Inspiring experience. Transcendent cognitive/emotional dimension. But it's not presented as, nor to be taken to be,<br />literal actuality, substantive reality. The &#34;proof of heaven&#34; is not a scientific demonstration or materialization. Dr.<br />Alexander's coma provided him, somehow, with an expansion of what life means, what existence entails, and thus<br />a sense of inclusivity and universality of all things as A Creation. Should such &#34;communion of being&#34; not be man's<br />relationship with his realm, fellow-men, environment, even political opponents? Wouldn't such confluence be more<br />Christian than the conflict and chaos and carnage that's bee the history of religions through the ages?  More<br />sacred are Alexander's visions as confluence of all into Creation-unity . . . .than the idolatrous fragmentations of<br />sects and statues and relics and recitations whereby any ONE-ness becomes reciprocal null-ness!!!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I dont understand this game looks fun but iv tryed downloading this 9x and deleted a lot of games.and apps I have plenty of space please fix I want to play this game !!!!!!!!!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Amazing, the life that bunch lived. Townshend's faults (addictions) are almost aside from<br />his abilities. (Perhaps those in close relationships with him might have differed with my<br />statement).
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Best action movie of the summer I wish it was more successful in the US because it's a really well made movie. The CG is phenomenal GDT put a lot of passion into this film.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is a must-read, especially for anyone dealing with education. The background of memorization as documentation is<br />extensive, and an impressive revelation how we're non-educating the mind by externalizing its storage. Worse, we just<br />don't teach anyone how to remember!!<br />Mr. Foer was briliiant before his memory-enhancement training. Given that enough &#34;palaces&#34; can be remembered<br />wherein he can store information other than cards, poems, binary digits . . . . he'll be formidable almost to a savant<br />status. I shall embark on mnemonic-enhancement, having now realized the access to so much information (and even<br />specific training). For more than ever now I realize just how bad my . . . .  what's it called . . . . you know, the thing<br />you have opposite forget . . . . .  . . . . . .
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|Is it a light history of botany?  Is it a 19th century travel log?  Is it historical fiction?  It took me a while to get into it - about half way through, which is normally way beyond what I will read if I am having to make myself  pick up a book.  It did finally capture my interest and was an enjoyable and somewhat leisurely read.
B00E5MXU4C|3.0|Amber continues being fun and has good detective instincts. This is an enjoyable read, I like both very serious books of crime and mystery, but at times the humor fits my lighter preference. I give fewer stars when MY preference is for the lighter reads. This and the other Amber Fox Mysteries were entertaining and I'd give a fourth a try if one exists.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|It's quick accurate and pretty.  It works equally well in multiple locations and it is quite easy to change locations when travelling.  I can say this app made my Kindle more valuable to me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Brilliantly written & acted. Great for the aesthetic value as well. How can you not love this show?? I never get tired of Maggie Smith.
B000002MY3|5.0|if you like angry sexy women - then this is for you. she needs some chocolate. lots and lots of it. instead of giving her roses at a concert give her chocolate.
B001NLL93W|5.0|It's a great read!!! Easy to follow, entertaining, keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can not wait for the next!
B000F1IQNC|5.0|I cannot remember how many times I have watched this movie when it is on TV so finally decided to buy it.  I absolutely love this movie!!!!!  A great family movie!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|LOVE IT!!! It is a keep you guessing type of movie. There are no dull scenes from the start, you will not see what is coming!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It was wonderful thing to turn to I Love it . It work fine  . I love it . I  sleep deep and still wok me up
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|When I first got this I liked it, however now it does not work very well.  The documents I create in the Kindle do not show up in my computer any more.  Do they have any technical help for this?
B0010T0JC4|5.0|I love Crocs, I own a pair in 3 different colors. I am a nursing student and I stand at Clinical for a long period of time. I purchased these because of the great experience I've had with Crocs in the past. Definitely a great addition. They fit snug and super comfortable. They even have extra holes so you can put them tighter or you can decorate them with Jibbitz. (Character clips)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Obviously the best app on the app store. Has stuff like the computer edition but  i wish they would update it more often. Other than that it is my favorite app on my kindle fire hd
B00632HWOG|2.0|It was fine before they &#34;upgraded&#34; it.  Difficult to open.  Don't like the way everything is lumped together.  Formatting stinks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the best Solitaire apps I've seen great way to kill some time. Or spend a afternoon,<br /> 10/10
