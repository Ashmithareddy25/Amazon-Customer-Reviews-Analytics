B002UIE5GA|4.0|Wanted to see something scary for halloween. This movie really wasn't that scary, although well made. It had an interesting and somewhat predictable plot, but kept me watching. Can recommend.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|Wonderfully creative and a fabulous great time to watch - best of the four Ice Age flicks.  I loved how the animators created the sense of size and weight of the Dino's.  This movie is definitely worthy of being the summer box office smash hit that it was, grossing 878.5 million worldwide.  Pixar, Disney, and Dreamworks can only \\"wish\\" they could produce a \\"cash-cow\\" like this movie for under 90 million.  I love some of the computer animated movies from those companies, as well.<br /><br />I saw Ice Age 3 for the first time when it came out on DVD.  I loved it. The movie had a very strong story but well-tempered by the comedy relief of Scrat, Scratte, & the Acorn. Speaking of the Scrat & Scratte scenes, this movie revived my interest in the classic song \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine,\\" by Lou Rawls, which was used as a romantic backdrop in those scenes.  It is a beautiful song.  I remember seeing Lou Rawls sing it on TV when I was a kid.<br /><br />After renting this movie to see it for the first time, I purchased my own DVD copy on Amazon.<br /><br />I have the blu-ray version of this movie as well.  The blu-ray version seems to be a poorly programed.  It is the only blu-ray in my collection that makes the device lock up every time, just after the movie starts with the opening scene of Scrat and Scratte.
0307454541|2.0|I love a good thriller but this was not even worth the time it took to read.  Definitely not memorable.  I almost put it down permanently several times.  Too wordy and too slow to get into the real suspense.  I will not be reading the sequel.

B000O176Q6|2.0|I don't know if this disc was not prepared correctly or what, but it did not play well for me.
B001TOVZYQ|5.0|This movie is subtitled but the action makes up for it. It also has a good story line. The fight scenes are great!
1416550542|5.0|Once in a while a special book comes along. \\"The Forgotten Garden\\" is one of these. Without any big publisher push, but simply word of mouth, this book is becoming a best seller like \\"The Kite Runner.\\" I could not put this book down. Although the first few pages were a bit confusing, I soon got into the rhythmn of moving back and forth through history and when I got to the final pages, I didn't want the novel to end as I had come to love the characters. The writing is beautiful and flowing and yet carries you along with the plot. I can't wait for her other books.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This diamond edition of Snow White comes with a regular dvd and a blu-ray disc. I don't own a blu-ray but plan on getting one. Having both discs is really a plus in this edition. I have to say the regular dvd alone has really come a long way with the quality of the picture and the sound from what I remember from when I was a kid. My kids and I both loved watching this classic Disney movie.
1401323820|5.0|During a record heat wave in New York City, famous journalist Jameson Rook has been allowed to tag along with Homicide Detective Nikki Heat's team, in order to write a story on NYPD's finest.  Their current case is the murder of a business man, pushed off his balcony to the street below. As the case begins to unravel, more bodies are found. And the case grows more complex. Nothing is what it seems, except for the palpable heat between Nikki and the charming but persistent Rook.<br /><br />Written to be obvious parallels to the tv show characters, I loved the camaraderie and sharp humor between the detectives and Rook. Much like the show, the writing is fast-paced and quick-witted. The characters themselves almost overshadow the plot. But the mystery itself is impressively complex and engaging. The relationship between Heat and Rook has the same chemistry that Beckett and Castle have on the show, though the novel gets much steamier.<br /><br />Fans of Castle will love this clever tie-in, often referred to in the show itself. It's fresh and fun novelization from a fantastic show. Heat Wave is a wonderful idea to get an audience pulled even further into the world of Castle, with a tangible representation.
1400063515|4.0|I bought this book because I am an active investor and I had a little knowledge of Nassim Taleb.  This is not an investment \\"stragegy\\" type book.   It will definitely challenge the way you look at the risk and rewards/penalities of most aspects in your life.      While I loved the book, some of the chapters (Taleb warns the reader as well)are a little boring to read.   Some of the discussion about philoshers from the 1500's and 1600's is beyond my level of interest. That said, they are still relevenant to the book.      Taleb does a great job illustrating the fallacies and the dangers of \\"bell curve\\" thinkers.       From investors standpoint I like this book a lot.  As mentioned before there are no specific strategies, but the book will help you in your mental approach towards investing and understanding risk.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|my son asked me to watch it with him,Didn't want to but I did. Wow I am glad I did. This is very cool. Love not only superman, but the Green Arrow is hilarious.Lots of action,romance,and comedy. Worth taking a look at.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Great, quality music truly stands the test of time.  Kansas 'Leftoverture' is a prime example.  This was a 'tour de force' progressive rock performance when it came out in the 70's, and it still is now.  In fact, considering the dearth of good 'free form' rock music these days, many would appreciate this killer release even more.  As a 48 year young music afficionado of many genres, this is one of the few releases I purchased in every living format over the decades.  First, as a high schooler, in album (LP) form, then 8-track tape, then cassette, then CD, and now even have it in MP3 form!  I'm not going to say any more.  If you like great, highly musical performances, do yourself a favor and pick up the remastered CD version of 'Leftoverture'.  The sonics are much improved, as I can readily tell on my high-end 'Magnepan' (MG-12/QR) planar, hi-res speakers and McIntosh amp.  Talk about an 'eargasm'!  Steal it, borrow it, or buy it, and TURN IT UP!!!
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown knows how to take characters and put them into a desparate situation so the reader has to keep turning the pages. I completed THE LOST SYMBOL last night and found it a satisfying reading experience.<br /><br />It was not the best piece of fiction that I've read this year but it was certainly worth reading.
141041986X|5.0|Wow. I was hooked from the first chapter. The stakes were high from the beginning and I found myself rooting for Katniss every step of the way.  Teen gladiators forced to fight for their lives, and yet there's humanity in the way the kids act once in the arena.    Loved this book!    Jason
B002GU5V24|5.0|This Box Set is a wonderful edition to the others. It has no \\"video\\" but i do believe that Seconds Outs makes up for all of that. All in all this is a great buy for the true fans, it really allows you to hear Genesis at there best! When they're LIVE!!!
0375405380|5.0|Gripping and exciting novel. Sometimes the style could be considered rather heterodox but it serves perfectly to put the reader in the appropriate state of mind. I have enjoyed it very much.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I agree with those that say this is a good workout.  It certainly challenges you.  What you might also find challenging is keeping your children's ears covered while she uses words like \\"ass\\" and \\"bad ass\\".  I have to work out at home due to having little ones and time constraints.  I prefer a workout that does not include language like this.  I highly recommend Jari Love, especially her newest Ripped 1000 DVD.  Awesome workout and no cussing.[[ASIN:B002G4ZZZ8 Jari Love: Get Extremely Ripped! 1000]]
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I grew up watching Star Trek because my parents loved it. I hated it. Maybe not hated, but disliked with a passion. So when this newest installment came out, I told myself I was only going to see it fore three reasons: 1) because my parents really wanted to see it, 2) because J.J. Abrams (creator of LOST) made it, and 3) because Chris Pine is beautiful.  Thankfully, I enjoyed it quite thoroughly because it is a FUN, exciting movie. You don't have to love Star Trek to appreciate this movie. You can even hate Star Trek and love this movie. :) J.J. Abrams is a genius, and he made this movie as a non-Trekkie movie for everyone. :)
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|I like all 3 of the \\"Ice Age\\" films.    Not the best animated films ever made, but they are enjoyable.    Now, I remember purchasing the original film when released on DVD.  All 3 films have made about the same at the American box office.    The Crash & Eddie characters introduced in the 2cd film are just as funny as they were before.    I enjoyed & found myself laughing several times in this film.    A point, similar to \\"Jurassic Park 3\\" where a similar looking dinosaur was the main villain dinosaur   Rudy in this film.    1 thing I do NOT like was the today references.  Like a character talking on a cell phone, the today phrases  Tacky & unnecessary.    Cheap, with NO EXTRAS on this.  Made nearly $200 million at the US box office & no extras.  Cheap.    Kids, families will enjoy the film.
0882709194|1.0|This is NOT Charle's Darwin's Origin of Species, which has contributed immensely to modern science.  The forward penned by intellectual lightweight Ray Comfort should be appalling to anyone scientifically literate, which attempts to link evolutionary theory to Hitler and Naziism, despite Hitler openly rejecting the theory.  Even without the forward, it's missing key parts of the original text.  If you want to brainwash your child into rejecting well-established scientific theories, this might be the book for you.  However, if you're scientifically literalte and you accept other equally valid science like gravity and biogenesis, you should stay far away from this if you don't want to die from eyerolling.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|I rented and watched this movie off of Netflix recently, when I have asked people I know if they liked it most people either hadn't seen it or said it was just okay so I wasn't expecting much out of this. However I did actually enjoy this movie. It gets going pretty fast and keeps this pace through out the whole movie and at 88 minutes long its just the right length as to not get stale. Hayden Christensen plays David Rice who has the ability to Jump, Jumping in this movie is an ability some have that allows them to teleport to anywhere they have been before instantly. After learning of this ability David runs away from home and his alcoholic father to New York, where he robs a bank. David is living a wonderful life and all seems well until Samuel L. Jackson's character Roland Cox who is a member of a secret organization that hunts down and kills Jumpers known as The Paladins catches up with him. The rest of the movie is a globe trotting action extravagnaza as David must protect his childhood sweet heart from this vicious hunter, and teams up with an unstable Jumper Griffin played by jamie Bell.<br /><br />  So all in all this movie was worth the rental, and I would encourage anyone who has not seen it to check it out. Christensen does a much better job in this movie than his boring performance in StarWars(although his evil scenes in StarWars were good), and the special effects, locations, and action sequences were pretty cool as well. I give this movie a 3 out of 5.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I saw this movie the night before Halloween and realized what an impact it had one me when I saw the kids in costumes on Halloween night. They key to really enjoying this movie is not knowing ahead of time what the twist is. How many movies have their been about the demon child? Well, this takes it a step further. Isabelle Fuhrman is truly remarkable as the 9 year old Russian child who is adopted by a well to do couple suffering from the stillbirth of their third child. Esther is the \\"older\\" child adopted to complete the family. She starts out as the dream child until she begins terrorizing her new brother and sister. I can't give away too much more but if you like suspense, ORPHAN is a great movie. It shows how a good story and a good cast is more important than pricey special effects.  I had to do some research and found out Fuhrman was only 10 when this movie was filmed. Here is a fine young actress with a bright future.
B002SJIO4A|2.0|I had been hearing positive things about this movie for the whole week prior to going to see this, things like \\"The best sci-fi movie since Bladerunner\\" and \\"amazing story with great looking scenes\\". To these things I have only one thing to say \\"HaHaHaaaaaaa\\"! If ever the term over-hyped can be used this would be a good place to start. I'd be lying if I said it didn't have it's moments, but getting there wasn't really worth it. I'm probably just not in sync with most of the world at this point in my life, G.I. Joe wich I had a fun time watching is getting trashed but this movie which I will probably never see again is being praised.<br /><br />  The story is done documetary-style which right there might be my problem with it, the only movie done like this that I have liked so far was Cloverfield and even then I feel these kind of movies are only good one time as they lose there realistic feeling for me. So when the movie opens we se a series of interviews that explain what happened twenty years ago when the alien spacecraft landed floating directly above Johannesburg, South Africa. A couple of months after the arrival of the craft the humans decide to cut their way inside, where they find a group of sickly looking alien beings that look like giant bug men. The creatures are referred to as \\"Prawns\\" which is not a flattering name and referrs to the Parktown Prawn Cricket species. At first these beings are treated and taken care of but eventually get thrown into a single slum like area know as district 9. A private company known as MNU takes over control of District 9. Wikus Van der Merwe played by Sharlto Copley is an employee of MNU and is assigned the task of giving the residents of District 9 24hr. eviction notices as they are being relocated to a new District 10 camp. During the evictions Wikus gets sprayed with some kind of Alien liquid he finds in one of the shacks and becomes sick. Personally Wikus was a total d$ck the whole time doing things such as burning the baby alien eggs for no real reason and tricking the aliens into signing the eviction papers, that I felt no sympathy when he fell ill. The exposure to this liquid changes his DNA and his body starts to transform into that of a Prawn, justice if you ask me. Wikus ends up working with the Prawns he once treated like crap to find a way to cure his body and get them home.<br /><br />  The best parts of the movie don't occur until the last half hour and by that time I had already made up my mind this movie kind of sucked, however there were some pretty good action sequences in the last part of the movie worth watching, but like alot of movies these days the ending was left open. I'm going to give this movie a 2 out of 5 don't believe the hype, this may be \\"The best sci-fi movie of the decade\\" to some, but for me I'll save that tag for movies more like the new Star Trek movie, the rest of you can keep this.he baby alien eggs for no real reason and tricking the aliens into signing the eviction papers, that I felt no sympathy when he fell ill.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|As a life-long fan of the J5/Michael Jackson, my heart was overwhelmed by this production. I remember as a little girl watching Michael and his brothers perform on the Ed Sullivan and the Carol Burnett show. Many years later, I'm overwhelmed at what I see before me.    I haven't read through the other reviews, but I can rest assured that anyone that gaive this documentary a \\"5\\" star, I will cosign and concur. Michael was bigger than life. This movie had me laughing, crying, singing, and wanting to dance in the aisle. Everyone from the dancers to the musicians to Ortega worked together to make this a must-see. If you are a MJ fan, you can't miss it!    RIP, Michael. We miss you so much, but thank you for leaving your gift to those of us that love you!!!    EXCELLENT!!!
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|received this movie from Netflix last night and was in the mood for a good adventure flick, so I decided to give this movie a try. From the opening scene I started to have this bad feeling in my gut as Trevor Anderson(Brendan Fraser) is having a nightmare about his brother Max running from a very silly looking CG Dinosaur and falling to his death. Still I figured it's just a dream sequence I'm sure the movie won't be as bad as the first minute, so I decided to continue with hope. In the first few scenes we see Trevor is not fairing to well at his job as a volcanologist at a school, infact his office is about to be shut down by some wormy looking guy you just want to hit. When Trevor goes home that evening and listens to his answering machine he is reminded that is thirteen year old nephew Sean(Josh Hutcherson) is coming to stay with him for the next ten days. When Sean's mother drops him off she gives Trevor a box with some of Maxes old stuff including a book Journey To The Center of The Earth.When Trevor opens the book later on he finds notes written by his late brother indicating he might have actually found the center of the earth. After going to his lab to look into it Trevor decided to head to Icland to investigate and brings Sean. So they get to Icland and pick up a guide Hannah(Anita Briem) and after a series of events get stuck underground where they end up in a world inside our own world, the center of the Earth.<br /><br />  So here's my take on this movie. It had it's moments, but they were few and far between. The effects weren't that good in my opinion, maybe if this was a made for TV movie but not up to par for blockbuster movie theater standards in my opinion. Most of the scenes look like they were real people with a moving picture behind them, and any of the creatures in this movie look so fake, almost cartoonlike with there expressions, infact this movie was like watching some kind of looney toons cartoon with live people. They can fall for miles and somehow survive without a scratch. The movie was released in 3-D in the theaters and maybe it looked good in that setting, but on DVD it just looks silly. I'm going to give this movie a 2 out of 5 I say if you have kids under ten it might be worth watching with them, otherwise I'd stay away from this one, there is a 1959 movie of the same name maybe oneday I'll check that one out.omehow survive without a scratch.

032147404X|5.0|I'm always a little hesitant to buy a book like this without flipping through it a little bit first but a friend had already recommended it.  Scott Kelby is a wonderful author.  The book is both informative and entertaining.  I am just a hobbyist but often find myself going back to reference this book.  I took me no time at all to read this book and really look forward to reading the second and third. (I bought all three right away.)
B002NXSRX4|4.0|I never watched the cartoon as a child or collected the dolls/toys either so I can't tell you how this movie stacks up compared to past works, what I can tell you is I went to see this movie yesterday not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised at what I did see. I was afraid not having been a fan I would not be able to follow what was going on, however this is more of an origin film and they do a great job of walking noobs like me through it. I had a blast watching this movie from start to finish, and this movie had some of the coolest action sequences I've seen this year.<br /><br />  Here is a brief plot synopsis, the movie takes place in the not too distant future where weapons expert James McCullen played by Christopher Eccleston has created a weapon that uses nanotechnology to basically eat through anything including whole cities. He sells four of these warheads to NATO, and Duke played by Channing Tatum and Ripcord played by Marlon Wayans are soldiers in the U.S. army  and are tasked with delivering the warheads. During the mission the pair are ambushed by the Baroness played by Sienna Miller, however they are saved by Scarlett played by Rachel Nichols, Snake Eyes played by Ray Park, and Heavy Duty played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje  members of a secret black ops group known as the Joes.They are then taken back to The Pit the Joe's command center in North Africa. Here Duke, and Ripcord convince General Hawk played by Dennis Quaid to let them join the team for this mission as they know the Baroness personally from the past.<br /><br />  The rest of the movie is a battle between the Joes and the double crosser James McCullen and his group of genetically altered soldiers over these warheads. There are some amazing fights in this movie I especially like the scenes with Sanke Eyes who's like some kind of super ninja and his rival Storm Shadow played by Lee Byung-hun. The whole car chase scene in France was amazing as well. This movie definitely snuck up on my top five movies of the year list, I'm going to give it a 4 out of 5 and would definitely recommend seeing it on the big sreen, to anyone who likes a good action flick.five movies of the year list, I'm going to give it a 4 out of 5 and would definitely recommend seeing it on the big sreen, to anyone who likes a good action flick.
0684833395|1.0|I personally don't read that many books, but this is one of the worst books I ever read. First, they're are too many characters. This book has too many characters that I can't remember even one of them in my head. They include many minor characters that nobody cares so you get confused about it. Second, it has too many mini-stories. It has lots of short stories that doesn't relate to any of the other stories and they are usually pretty boring. Third this is none sense. It doesn't have a major theme or anything and it's just talking about air force men being board of the war and just being crazy. It's like writing every detail of your every day life. I cannot believe that it saids on the behind that it is one of the greatest American literature and I would definitely not recommend to anyone.
0061914177|2.0|I recently saw this book pumped by Fox and other outlets with everybody talking up the brilliance of the author. On Fox he explained the premise behind the book, his passion for wine, etc., but I still didn't see what the fuss was about. Nevertheless, I borrowed a copy and checked it out like everybody else caught in the whirlwind.<br /><br />As soon as I saw favorable promotions on the cover written by that shallow, self absorbed fool Tim Ferris (author of The Four Hour Work Week), I was immediately glad I didn't pay a cent for this book. Content wise, it is a short summary of the latest internet venues that won't come as a surprise to anyone under 40 who hasn't been living in a cave since high school. Anyone older could use the book as a decent primer on all things beyond Friendster, including of course Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Plaxo (but no Linked In-?) etc. Even so, a primer should either be a freebie on the web or something more substantial than 142 pages of big print hardcover brochure-ware selling for twenty bucks a copy. If you must get one, please avail yourself of a Borders coupon or wait till someone has a sale in a month or so - paying full price would be a genuine slap in the face you don't deserve.<br /><br />On that note, it seems that more non-fiction books ostensibly offering how-to marketing advice are going away from actual useful content and drifting into ad-ware territory. This book is no exception, and is a loss-leader used as an adverising medium to up-sell the reader on whatever else the author has in store (see also Buyology, and practically everything sold in the real estate section these days, especially by Kiyosaki and Robert G. Allen).<br /><br />Here, the author is using blog postings posing as a book and selling it to the olestra-eating masses in a slick hardcover format with a very trendy black cover. I can't blame him for this if it turns a profit or leads to more business elsewhere, but for anyone seeking a useful plan of action, it bears remembering you will not be satisfied nor can most people realistically expect to follow his footsteps, as several others pointed out already. T. Ferris's similar book was even more insipid but equally well-received (how many plumbers, cops and firemen can do the 4 hour work week-?). Most readers of these books don't fit that mold, but imagine themselves as such. If you must dream of a more exciting life amongst the trendy independent folk sporting shiny, spiky stuff in their hair while sipping mocha choco-tinis from chilled stemware at uber-trendy LEED certified bars, at least do it with a borrowed copy like I did.you will not be satisfied nor can most people realistically expect to follow his footsteps, as several others pointed out already.

B000ZELISO|1.0|As our heroes grow older they have invariably grown far less mature. The topics actually covered in the movie are trifling and almost ridiculous (i.e. a group of teachers standing quietly and awkwardly by while two hormone-crazed teens talk about who loves whom...), and the book plot that was disregarded and omitted held so much more depth and detail. This movie is a disappointment for fans of the books I imagine, as it was for me. I find it's treatment of young love insulting not only to teenagers in general, but to the actors and audience as well. I wouldn't avoid this movie as it's a necessary step in the series evolution but it's content is going to be a let down for anyone expecting something with insight or profundity.

I think this book should be read understanding that the author was encountering something fairly new and devoid of a complicated modern culture (unlike we have now).  This is well written, but at time drags on with detail that perhaps needs some shared perspective to appreciate.    This is NOT a how-to book or a guide.  It is an example of personal experiences.

B002MW50KY|5.0|By now I've learned to receive new work from Bard Dylan with an open mind and an open heart. This makes it so much easier to enjoy his art. I love this album and the spirit in which it is given. The fact that homeless people will benefit was reason enough for me to buy it. The Bettie Page shot is an added bonus. I doubt Bob is making some kind of statement here.  Rather he is making nostalgic music. I do find it refreshing, and vintage Dylan, to include traditional carols which tell the story of The Christ Child, when so many stars bow down to political correctness and worry about offending people. My favorite song is \\"The Christmas Blues\\".  This is a classic for me.
1416594787|5.0|In this Year of Darwin, it's not surprising to see a new book from one of the leading proponents of Evolution.  Dawkins has covered the topic from many angles in the past, this time, however, he's poking his fingers in the eyes of Creationists/\\"Intelligent Designers\\" (or, as he prefers to call them, \\"History deniers\\").  Dawkins begins by stating the dictionary definitions of the word \\"theory\\", a common entry point on Creationist dogma.  The first definition of the term is, to paraphrase, \\"an explanation that describes  a set of facts.\\"  This, he maintains, is what the Theory of Evolution is; a model which describes a set of facts.  The \\"History deniers,\\" however, insist on pointing to another definition of the term -- again to paraphrase, \\"a conjecture that describes a set of observations that have not been tested.\\"  By the end of the book, there is no doubt whatsoever that the first definition is the correct one when describing evolution.    Dawkins also purports to give readers ammunition they can use when going up against Creationist/Intelligent Designer pinheads.  His examples superbly describe the evidence for evolution beyond any shadow of a doubt -- however, the examples are not of the sort that simpletons will readily understand or concede.  He does debase another tiresome argument that the \\"fossil record is incomplete\\" and \\"riddled with missing links;\\"  Dawkins goes on to explain how we can prove evolution without using a single fossil, and besides, we have plenty of \\"missing links,\\" the deniers just keep saying that as if constant repetition will make the evidence go away.  Some of the hard, indisputable evidence comes from experiments in microbiology -- which is where the ammunition gets a little sophisticated for use in your average bar fight.    The conclusion of the book in inescapable -- the Theory of Evolution is not dogma, to be taught alongside alternate opinions -- it is fact and needs to be taught as such.  One of the staggering statistics he repeated often is that 44% of Americans actually believe the earth is less than 10,000 years old and that humans coexisted with dinosaurs.  While there is some good stuff here to throw at them, most will just yell \\"la la la\\" when you try to make them less ignorant.

B0029O08WA|4.0|I'm not a big fan of the first movie, which I saw, not sure I will even see the new one. But when I saw the amazing line-up of artists collected for this soundtrack, I simply had to have this. And I really don't see this as a 'soundtrack' as such, as I couldn't care less how these songs might or might not fit into the movie proper (more on that later).<br /><br />\\"Soundtrack from New Moon\\" (15 songs, 58 min.) brings a fabulous collection of mostly indie-music. It starts off with a great new track from DCFC, \\"Meet Me at the Equinox\\", which is up there in quality with their \\"Narrow Stairs\\" album. Band of Skulls' \\"Friends\\" rocks hard. THE standout contribution on this collection is Thom Yorke's \\"Hearing Damage\\", a 5 min. electronic dark and gloomy track that expands on his \\"The Eraser\\" solo album, and it just makes me wish for more solo material to come from him, just fabulous. But there are plenty of other nuggets on here: Lykke Li's \\"Possibility\\", Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's acoustic \\"Done All Wrong\\" (reminiscent of their \\"Howl\\" album\\", Bon Iver & St. Vincent's sparse but mesmorizing \\"Roslyn\\", Editors' \\"No Sound But This Wind\\", and Grizzly Bear's \\"Slow Life\\" are all no-miss highlights. Muse is on here as well (as they were on the first soundtrack), with \\"I Belong To You\\" in a remix version of their recent \\"The Resistance\\" album (word has it that Stephanie Meyer is a huge fan of theirs, hence the repeat appearance). There are no true weak tracks on here, period.<br /><br />In all, even though I'm generally not a fan of these types of multi-band compilations, I can't say enough how much this collection resonates. Great, great music. This is incidentally the third multi-band compilation this year that I have come to enjoy and love, after the \\"War Child Presents Heroes\\" and \\"Dark Was the Night\\" charity albums. Finally, if you wonder where you can hear many of the artists featured on the \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none.that brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none.
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|First off, I never read the graphic novel, so I won't be comparing it to the movie or vice versa.  Second, I heard that Alan Moore wouldn't even let his graphic-novel writing credit into the movie, which prompted me to do a little digging into Alan Moore.  Frankly, he sounds like he'd be a difficult person to live with or be friends with.  In fact, he's probably ramping up for next year's Renaissance Fair in Sterling Forest, a supposition based on the photos of him that I've seen, the recent, odd publications he's produced and the biographies I've read about him.<br /><br />That being said, I came away from \\"Watchmen\\" rather impressed.  The opening credits are done exceptionally well, presenting a history of the Watchmen group circa 1940 from its inception to its existence in the movie's present day of 1985, with Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" as the song (which is pretty good, even though I don't generally like Dylan's voice).  Later on, there's a fantastic scene where the Comedian and a giant Dr. Manhattan are fighting in the Vietnam War with Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" playing, not to mention a post-war Vietnam bar incident.  Wow.<br /><br />My big issue with \\"Watchmen\\" was the sheer ridiculousness of the superhero, which in this film generally constitutes nothing more than a human being running around in a costume fighting for the good old U.S. of A.  Some of their names add to the silliness, namely \\"Silk Spectre\\" and \\"Ozymandias.\\"  And why does Rorschach's mask have moving bloodstains when his face doesn't?  Unexplained.<br /><br />The Comedian, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan (from the \\"Supernatural\\" TV series), and Nite Owl II, played by Patrick Wilson, are the best characters in the movie.  Morgan steals every scene he's in with profane sass and violent behavior.  Outstanding job.  Wilson's Nite Owl is the kindest superhero of the bunch and, for that reason, is the most likeable.  The \\"Silk Spectre II\\" character, played by Malin Akerman, also has quite a few redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Although I'm sure it's all pretty much computer-generated, there's WAY TOO MUCH of Dr. Manhattan's swingin' blue pepe in this movie.  I'm surprised no one in the movie--the Comedian, for instance--makes any cracks about it.  That would be the first thing I would say: \\"Hey, Manhattan, could you put some pants on!  I don't wanna get poked in the eye, you know.\\"<br /><br />All in all, the movie is worth watching, but be prepared to be somewhat confused about all the goings on in the movie (i.e. if you haven't read the graphic novel).  I had to go back and review a few sections after my first viewing in order to gain some clarity as to who was who and what was what.  Plus there were a few impressive scenes I wanted to see again.  I think there's so much going on in \\"Watchmen\\" that it turned some people off (\\"Transformers\\" crowd) and annoyed some fanboys because it couldn't cinematically do enough justice to the heavy, involved storyline.  You've really got to stay focused throughout the entire movie to catch every detail.ng qualities.

B0017R5UAA|3.0|As far as I can tell this is the first Fleet Foxes album, and as far as debuts go, this one is solid enough. I'm not sure how this ended up on so many people's Top 10 lists, but everyone is entitled to his opinion. If you think this is one of the best CDs released in 2008, all the more power to you.    What do I like about the record? I have to say the vocals are great. There are fantastic harmonies that are relatively out of the ordinary for a pop record - although they are hardly revolutionary. Just about all of the songs are nice to listen to, while I'm listening to them. But I can't manage to really remember them after the album is over.     I guess that would be my major problem with the CD. I can't really comment on any of the individual songs because I honestly can't tell you how any of them go, and I have listened to the CD several times. There's so much reverb, that it is difficult to hear the performances of the group members. I'm not sure if it is because of the production, but most of the songs sound the same to me.      I'm sorry if the review is kind of \\"ho-hum\\" but that pretty much sums up my feelings toward the record. Still, in the liner notes the band hopes that we will all pay attention to them as they grow and evolve. I hope that on future efforts, they can fully develop the potential that they display here.     BTW, if you like this record you may like early Fairport Convention stuff. They had great vocals, the world's least-well-known gonzo guitarist (Richard Thompson),  with a sound which was derived from British folk traditions.
B00006AUIG|5.0|I found this to be a good story and a creepy scary movie; the acting was excellent - the beginning of the story doesn't prepare you for the psychological twist that is the basis for the film. This is a movie I have not forgotten; a good ensemble cast whose characters evoke empathy from the viewer. Because it was not an out and out horror film, more of a frightening psychological thriller, it leaves the viewer guessing as to whether or not the supernatural is involved or what is real -- what is imagined...i appreciated the film a lot. Defintely recommend this.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I disagree with the first two reviewers; this IS a bad book.  The characters aren't fully realized, the plotting is bumpy and dull, the scenery could be wonderful- Washington, D.C. is a beautiful and vibrant city- but it's dull and narrowed.      If you don't know who Robert Langdon is before you read this book, you won't know when you're finished either.  This read, to me, like the screenplay for the movie the author knows will be made and so he will let the director tell the story.  It also reads like an apology to the Church as well as to Masons for any dismay he may have caused them from past books.    It really IS a bad book.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw this incredible documentary about what would have been the greatest comeback tour by Michael Jackson. Michael still showed us he still had that amazing voice and amazing dance moves. I was in awe the whole time. He made me smile, he made me dance in my seat, and he made me cry because this is really it. Everyone in the theater stayed until the end of the closing credits and nothing but sad faces from everyone leaving. I've always loved Michael, but after seeing this is it, I love him even more.  May he rest in peace and may God bless his beautiful children.
B001GCUER0|5.0|If your a fan of this show, then you know how often you think back to previous seasons trying to recall characters and lines. The DVD Sets of both Mad Men Season's I and II also have commentary by actors and directors. If you don't know anyone else who is into this show and haven't got anyone to share the excitement with, I recommend watching the episodes and reading Alan Sepinwall's reviews at [...]. -as well as his readers' comments, which are both excellent.
B002PTHKNY|3.0|I thought I was purchasing a vinyl copy and it turned out to be a CD.  Also, I paid for 2-3 day shipping and it didn't get there on time as they mistakenly ordered regular shipping and charged me for 2-3 day shipping.  I called and they took care of the overcharge and apologized.  My biggest complaint was that when I typed in vinyl copy, I got two choices as seen here on the right.  That is why I assumed it was the vinyl copy.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|I was very dissapointed that Kingdom of Heaven was overlooked at the box office. Following the success of both Gladiator and Black Hawk Down, Ridley's Scott's tale of war and religion seemed like a sure thing when it hit theaters but it flopped, which is too bad because this is a very good film.<br /><br />Kingdom of Heaven is Ridley's Scott's way of telling us that things haven't changed as much they sometimes seem. A thousand years ago we used to slaughter each other -in the name of God of all things- and a millenium later we still do. Of course, the film delves deeper into the issue by depicting the inner-struggle we all go through when it comes to this subject in the form of the main character, Balian, played by Orlando Bloom; (The Lord of the Rings) a man trying to find answers about himself, who by a twist of fate is thrown right in the middle of the religious and political battle in which he had nothing to do with. Balian goes from a grieving blacksmith in France to a Baron and knight trying to protect an ideal that might have never really existed.<br /><br />Kingdom of Heaven arrives on Blu-Ray in the form of a Director's Cut with added content that did not make it to theaters. Apparently, the film was substantially trimmed to keep the running time friendly. Those who have seen this film know that the film is plenty long to begin with. This edition is not a series of \\"missing\\" or deleted scenes that were put back but the restoration of major storylines that add a lot of weight to the overall film. If anything, the Director's Cut helps us to understand the circumstances that throw Balian into the events of the film. I don't want to give away anything to those who haven't watched the added content. Let's just say that the story and relationship between Balian and his father Godfrey is much more involved than it appears on the theatrical release. As a fan of the film I enjoyed the added content but must warn: We are talking about a substantial addition that considerably adds to the running time. Invariably, the pacing becomes much slower, especially at the beginning where Scott takes his time explaining things this time around. It might not be for everyone.<br /><br />I mention this because of the major flaw of this particular release: The original version of the film is not included here and apart from a theatrical trailer, there are no special features either. This is unacceptable. One of the major advantages of Blu-Ray technology is the added space. Why not have both versions of the film? And if you are going to just put the Director's Cut in there then at least put in some content that explains the logic behind this release in the form of commentaries, documentaries and the like. In that respect this disc is severely lacking.<br /><br />In the High Definition front, this version of Kingdom of Heaven is a true revelation. When I saw this film in theaters and the (many)subsequent viewings on cable and DVD, I was curious about the color palette used in the film. The entire film seemed to be covered in a bluish hue reminiscent of the opening battle scene in Gladiator. Since it was consistent at the theater, DVD and cable TV I thought it was Scott's original intent. However, watching this film on Blu is like watching it for the first time. The colors simply come alive in HD. Primary colors (which were conspicuously absent previously) come alive. Off the top of my head comes to mind the fight Balian has right after the shipwreck, where his opponent's clothing now literally glows, the yellows popping out in the desert setting. There are other areas like the greens at the beginning of the film which take place in France and Balian's new inherited home. Heck, even the crab one of Godfrey's men puts in front of Balian shows reds I hadn't noticed before. I fail to recall a more perplexing change in color quality from theater to Blu-Ray. But colors are not the only thing that benefit from this HD release. Textures come alive as well. Maybe I simply wasn't paying attention but did you notice that the King of Jerusalem's mask has a goatee? Neither did I, but in this release, it is clearly visible. That is the level of detail that has been achieved on this release.<br /><br />Kingdom of Heaven is a very good film and they have made a wonderful transfer to HD for it. However the lack of special features and the almost criminal omission of the theatrical version keep me from giving it full marks.g attention but did you notice that the King of Jerusalem's mask has a goatee?

B002OOG6RQ|5.0|It's strange to be moved so emotionally by music without understanding the lyrics. Between the time this album started and finished, I was literally moved to tears twice, and was brought to clenched fists and headbanging which I could not contain. I have not felt like this since Mutter was released in 2001. This one is slightly better than Mutter, which for me makes it their best one ever, and I hope best one yet. With a title like Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da (Love For All Of You), it's easy to feel like this might be their last. If it is, then they went out on top. This is the album that I feel like Rammstein was always trying to make...a strange and exotic blend of theatric, gothic, and industrial elements which form something that sounds unique unto itself. While their first two releases (Herzeleid and Sehnsucht, respectfully) focussed primarily on the industrial elements, with some moments in Sehnsucht hinting at a more gothic tone, the release of Mutter saw Rammstein at the top of their game. Mutter was an adaption of Rammstein's sound without being a departure, a simple addition of string and choir effects on top of their pre-existing sound, with more emphasis on melody from the synth sounds and Till's vocals. This \\"simple change\\" as I call it, resulted in a dramtic difference in something that still felt so familiar, and resulted in their best album so far. Presumably excited by the results which this addition brought, the band used their next two albums (Reise, Reise and Rosenrot, respectfully) to go further with this element. While I did feel Reise, Reise to be a slightly weaker release than Mutter, the sake of exploration and the stronger tracks of the album more than justified what I felt was a journey away from some of their core elements. This journey however seemed to go too far with Rosenrot, which I suspect was a B-sides album of sorts being that Rosenrot was originally rumored to be the title of Reise, Reise and that it was released only a year later. Ifthese were B-sides it is clear to see why, but as an album this release did not stand up for me and was the weak link in their chain. However, if Goldilocks taught us anything, it is that sometimes you have to go too little, then too much, before you find what's just right. This, I feel, is what explains Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da. Much like Mutter felt like the simple addition of strings and choirs to achieve a more pronounced gothic element than Sehnsucht and Herzeleid, Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da seems like the return of their industrial sound and rough heaviness to this primarily theatric style of late. The fantastic production blends these sounds into an inseparable mixture. This is why I say it is the album they've always been trying to make, and did to a certain extent already with Mutter, which along with this album makes the only two where I feel all the elements combined and were equally represented. What puts this latest just a bit ahead of Mutter is the inseperable nature...while listening to most of the tracks on Mutter you can assume fairly easily which elements were part of the original draft of the song and which were added later. This simply is not true of Liebe Ist Fur Alle Da, which neither neglects nor emphasises the ugly over the beautiful, or the soft over the rough. If there are two weaker tracks, they are B********* and Pussy, but I honestly feel after the emotional journey of the first seven tracks I was ready for the lighthearted single which had me rolling my eyes but still moving and getting into it (a strange combination). The album feels and flows like an opera, with each track falling at a logical point, never shattering the overall feel (as I said, Pussy merely cleanses the pallate for the final act). The first three tracks are there to park your ass and make you realize that this is something big, while track 4 acts as an anchored wade into different waters. The emotional climax of track 6 leaves Tracks 7 to be more of an atmospheric affair, with track 8 clensing the pallate for the more intricate Tracks 9 and 10. Track 11 feels, partially because of my Western thinking associated with the whistling, like a walk off into the sunset after the good fight has been fought. If this is true, then the fight was won, and the day belonged to Rammstein.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As far as the movie is concerned It's the best.   The combination of real people telling the story and they seeing in action is outstanding.  They were the greatest generation.

B002JM1VJG|4.0|As a late Madonna fan, I watched this dvd selection of her videos in awe!    I'm so glad she included Justify my Love and Erotica, but they are edited a bit, and someone as strong in her opinions as Madonna, I thought, would see this as   a disappointment, since she enjoys pushing the limits, especially re: SEX, I  also loved the video where she is showing her real self for the first time in LIKE A VIRGIN! It always brings back great memories of when I was going to dance clubs  mainly in Hollywood, many re-mixes of that song..I wish she included Gambler,  and the Thunderpussy video, that shows almost all her videos in clips.    FROZEN is an incredible video meaning different things to different people, that video shows her other side I feel, that's why she's all in blk,she really feels in that video.    The video, Human Nature,is another fave of mine, very disappointed that the song was edited, it's not like the video that expresses much more, when she says certain words that fit the video and song, and at the end she has a laugh on us, as in the end of Justify My love, where she is laughing at the end, in the hotel hall..    I can't understand why HOLIDAY was not on the videos either, one of her famous fun   songs..or Sooner or later where her range is different, would have loved a video for that song, and PLEASE LOVE ME, KEEP IT TOGETHER, are other songs that should have been on video..in this collection..    For Madonna's look back though, I gave it four stars because of some of the videos she included, but I feel Madonna herself didn't have as much say on this collection  as would have been, if they were all on her own label, and  the videos wouldn't   be edited at all.I missed LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE too..         This collection reminded me of when her book, SEX just came out, and was a big hit everywhere, still is!    Sadly, my friend who died of Aids, left that book to me, and I think of him when I see it..he adored all her videos too! She has made so many people accept themselves for what they really are, so they can be real to themselves..    She left out one of her first dance songs too, EVERYBODY, she really looks so different in those baggy pants and vest,A very young Madonna..    The Madonna of today, is so well fashionable she changes with every tour, and sometimes with every new song, that's the secret to her being a true DIVA! Only Cher has accomplished that..    These videos all show her independance, the video, EXPRESS YOURSELF, allowed some women for the first time to feel their power,equal to men, sexually when she seems to always get what she wants, esp. that gorgeous guy in that video..who is in the Vogue video too.    The video of Deeper and Deeper, one of my faves,she really looks like a flower child, and when they did that photo shoot in the video, it shows another new look for her..the banana scene is so funny, I loved that scene..Madonna has a great sense of humor..    I'm amazed that Madonna is probably the best woman around,in her decade, that has the energy for all those videos, just watching Rain, is so visually fantastic, whoever directed that video had an eye to show Madonna at her best.     I highly recommend this dvd collection, it's a great look back at Madonna's vast work  since the eighties..and beyond.    Toni Nason
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw this film last night, and it was truly outstanding and exciting!  It shows a side to Michael Jackson that we have not seen before.  The rehearsals were beautiful!  Michael was involved in every aspect of production, and he was very gracious, humble, and hard-working.  He still had his amazing talent at age 50... The music, dancing and singing were excellent!  I can't stop thinking about how beautiful and wonderful this movie was!  How well-made it was! I could watch it again and again! I wish I could have seen Michael perform the show live in London! I am so glad I was able to see this wonderful film and will miss Michael very much!  May God bless Michael and the wonderful Jackson family!

0385504225|2.0|This book contains some interesting facts which, I'm certain, took some digging to gather and imagination to even look for. Aside from this being eerily similar to the Da Vinci Code in its plot and style the ending is highly implausible in that, within a 10 hour span, among the three main characters, each had significant trauma but within an hour or two they were calmly strolling around appreciating architectural features, enjoying a sunrise and sharing philosophy. I think a more normal reaction would have been: Holy crap! Get me to a hospital!    This is not Dan Brown's best effort or even close. It's quickly paced but predictable.
B002MW50KY|4.0|Like Bob Dylan in general, this record is not for everyone. He is an acquired taste, always has been, always will be. But he is an American Music/Cultural icon and legend and deserves his place in the Christmas album lexicon. (Heck, Elvis put out two Christmas albums and Johnny Cash three! - there's certainly room for ONE from Bob!)  I have played this record for many people, some fans, some not. Basically the reaction is the same: they smile and yes, laugh (some out loud) and add \\"OMG!\\" from time to time. But this reaction is consistently for the religious material - come on, that whiskey&smoke voice singing latin -[ who could keep a straight face?!). Without fail however, when one of the very eclectic selections of the secular/popular pieces come on, the reaction changes. \\"Whoa, this is a cool!\\" I'll Be Home For Christmas, The Christmas Blues, Must Be Santa and especially Christmas Island are not just good - they're great. Throughout however, the arrangements are spot on, Dylan's band - made up mostly of his touring ensemble - is tight and on the money with each selection. So is this for everyone? Certainly not. It is a novelty like all Christmas records and a wonderful way to support the battle against domestic and international hunger as ALL of the proceeds, from now on, go to such worthy organizations. Great for livening up holiday parties and perfect for changing the subject at those uncomfortable family gatherings we all must endure this time of year.  If you love Bob, you'll love it. If you like Bob, you'll like parts of it. If you hate Bob, You'll have new fodder for your mockery. Buy it. Give it. Laugh with it. God Bless you, Bob.

No one that has even a marginal education would take this seriously.....not because they are overly skeptical, but because they are intelligent.    Basically, guessed where the big secret was hidden about two-hundred pages before it was revealed.  So it was simply a matter of reading through pages to get there.  Agree with above comments that Langdon turned into a moron, offering virtually nothing to help solve the mystery. The bad 'enlightenment' phrases that go something like: \\"actually, most respected leaders of the field have known this for years....yada yada\\" which ends with some absurd notion that Noetics isn't total garbarge and instead has a massive following of brilliant scientists.    The end truth that is revealed is what exactly?  Some crap that everyone already knows?  Really? if that is what is buried, what is the point of the secrecy and the ridiculously complex codes hiding the 'secret' that isn't really a secret at all.    Why hide that at all? So boils down too......what was the point of all this?

If this concert actually took place, it would have been someting none of us have experienced till date. The coreography, the dancers, the effects,, the costumes, the sets..in fact everything was to be a treat of a lifetime & its Extremely Sad that during the last years of his life 'MICHAEL JACKSON' was slaughtered by the press, his appearance, his acts were all made fun of..few remembered all great things he did, the love he spread, the world he tried to change thru his great voice & awesome music..Its Sad he's not here to see all this love now..I guess we only value things after they are gone........
1594481717|4.0|A couple a career coaches at the networking groups I attend suggested this book as required reading and I agree. Information is so ubiquitous this day in age that a person has to distinguish themselves through \\"high concept, high touch\\" actions, services and products.     I particularly like the concepts of design and story. It easy to see how these concepts apply, even to the internet itself. For example, we have all seen websites that are \\"flat\\": They have a couple of pictures, some bullet lists & short paragraphs, and maybe 3 or 4 linked pages. We place low credibility not only with the site, but with the organization behind it. Contrarily, look at sites like [...] that provides dictionary and thesaurus assistance that is both fun to use and provides INSTANT VISUAL UNDERSTANDING. Similarly, look at how the REAL School Gardens in Fort Worth, Texas tells a story about itself using a stepping stone path rather than bullets or prose. ([...])     Like many others, I think Mr. Pink is on target with his insights on the direction our society is headed.

The story is not good, the twist are not good. I have the impression that Mr Brown wanted to finish with the curse of Da Vinci Code and take off the pressure from publishers and public alike. I am still pretty sure we will have the opportunity to read again a great novel from Mr Brown, once this frenza is apssed and he has time.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw THIS IS IT in IMAX and it was an absolute thrilling experience. The huge screen and over 30 surround sound speakers made you feel as though you were at a live concert. Tickets were $12. but worth it. At the end of our showing, movie goers continued to sit in their seats. No one wanted to leave the theater because we all felt the sadness of never seeing Michael in live concert again. Michael showed his genius behind the scenes by fine tuning musical notes and his choreography. You left the theater thinking Michael couldn't have been 50 years old the way he danced with his 20+ year old back-up dancers, who clearly idolized him. And you also left knowing how special Michael was and thanking GOD for allowing Michael to briefly visit with us.
B000UD08HW|5.0|I have been to many concerts (50 years old) and watched and collect concert DVD and this performance is by far the best live show I have ever seen. I am not overly hip on David Bowie doing Comfortably Numb, but the bonus track of it with Rick Wright is awesome and makes up fo it.

B002KDUDG6|4.0|I had never heard anything by Michael Buble before this album, but a close friend of mine is a crazy fan, so I was excited to discover what her obsession was all about.  I understand this CD is a bit different for him - the live band in the studio as well as the song selections - but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  \\"Cry Me a River\\" was fascinating, unlike any version I've heard.  I especially liked \\"Crazy Love\\" and \\"Georgia on my Mind.\\"  Both were gorgeous and made me melt just a bit.  His voice is unique, and his songs range from fun, big band-esque to quiet and simple - no frills needed.  It's not exactly my normal style of music, but I can definitely appreciate his talent and creativity.  Plus, now I have a new understanding of my friend's love!

630469654X|2.0|While the idea behind this movie has great potential its actual execution was rather blase. The soundtrack takes away from the story instead of enhancing it, the acting is not that great, and the script is kind of silly.

0385504225|3.0|The Lost Symbol, continues the story of famed symbologist, Robert Langdon. The lovable protagonist is called in again, shrouded in mystery, to help solve one of the longest running myths in American history, and come to the rescue of his long-time mentor. It would make one wonder, why he would even answer his phone! Steeped in \\"suspense,\\" the reader is lead from the improbable to the impossible, and back again.    This journey starts like many of the Robert Langdon novels. He is swimming. He is contacted by a strange man, with a crazy mission. He joins the crazy mission. He almost dies, somehow doesn't, and finally becomes a hero. Purely formulaic. With that critique out of the way, we can look at some positives.    This book is addictive at times. Once you get into the story it's really hard to put it down. Brown continues to write in an authoritative manner, which makes you believe he honestly knows what he's talking about. That, I think, is the secret for his success, and is his biggest weakness.    The only other complaint I have about this book, is the ending. It goes on 40 pages longer than it should. By the time he reaches page 509, you wish you had something better to occupy your time. It's not his endless psycho-babble that ruins it, but it's the fact that Dan Brown has a serious case of diarrhea of the keys. He has a tendency to use 100 words when 10 would suffice.    I know I've been hard on this book; however, it was an enjoyable read. The story itself is very good, and has enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. If you can get past the inaccuracies, and the tedious descriptions you could enjoy this read.

B000QXDED6|5.0|Watching the amazing. hallucinatory 2007 film '300' is a visual treat not soon to be forgotten, it's like experiencing history through the eyes of Salvador Dali. To make the viewing experience even more impressive is the inclusion of a highly intelligent script with dialogue that resonates with the audiences intellect and  emotions. Action and philosophy merge as one as deeds and word meld into a comprehensive worldview examining the paradigms of both the people of Sparta and those that would seek to enslave them. As the brave 300 battle against insurmountable odds a profound Spartan philosophy of war is lived out before your eyes and one comes to understand and embrace what they are doing and the reason behind their willingness to die for the greater good.<br /><br />'300' is a one-of-a-kind film that I will never get tire of watching. It's an absolutely astonishing cinematic achievement!
1579128149|3.0|This book IS NOT a heavy, scientific \\"text\\".  Certain interesting scientific information, such as estimated quantities found on earth, regarding each of the elements presented is not included.  Perhaps a little more \\"context for the content\\" presented would be helpful.    This book IS a terrific high-school-level overview of the building blocks of the universe.  It is interesting and mostly non-scientific.  Most of the photos are very good.  Readers will not need a science background to enjoy the book.  My older grandsons (14, 13, and 11) enjoyed reading about their \\"favorite\\" elements in their gift copy.
6305428042|3.0|This movie was a great little halloween movie to sit down and watch with the kids, but contrary to alot of the reviews here it's NOT for smaller children. There is swearing in the movie (d word, h word, and several unnecessary references to virginity and 'Yabos' referring to breasts) and there are several creepy spots with a zombie that smaller kids won't care for at all.   Personally I think if your child is 14 and up they'll get a kick out of it. If they're 17 they'll just laugh at you.  If they're younger, save your money.
B001TOD9VI|2.0|The first time I saw The Wrestler, I was looking forward to it so much. It was a much-hyped film from the imagination of Darren Aronofsky, who directed Requiem for a Dream- one of the most powerful movies of the decade. However I was expecting to be disappointed after that majestic turd that was \\"The Fountain\\". And the first time I saw the movie, I thought it was disappointing. But actually, upon a second viewing, that seems to be an understatement- It's a bad movie.<br /><br />OK, yes, Rourke did great in his performance, seeing as not very many can pull off the gritty \\"Washed up wrestler\\" type figure that has mainly been done (to death) several times before. ANd Yes, it is rather unfortunate he was snubbed. However, I think his performance is what alone saved the movie from a 1 star rating.<br /><br />Basically, the storyline is nothing special. A washed up wrestler moping and whining about his life. IT's pretty entertaining for a bit, but, as it turns, it's more of the same the more the movie unfolds. THe fight scenes are brutal, not pretty, but very well done- they seem to capture the spirit of Wrestling, which is a brutal as hell sport. But the look of the film is not well. It may be the grainy blu-ray look, but the film has muted and washed-out visuals, combined with headache-inducing shaking camera that does get distracting.<br /><br />THe film, thankfully, is not too long- That seems to be a thing with Aronofsky, he keeps his movies short and sweet (thank God for that. Had he done the opposite with Requiem for a Dream, I'd OD on Prozac, LOL!) However, there's almost nothing redeeming about this film, except for Marisa Tomei looking like she usually does, Mickey Rourke's amazing performance, and the fight scenes. But aside from that, this is not a good movie at all.
1401323820|4.0|At the exclusive Guilford in Manhattan, sexagenarian Matthew Starr falls from his sixth floor apartment.  Leading the investigation into the death of the mega realtor is NYPD Detective Nikki Heat.  Besides her competent team, she is saddled with writer Jameson Rook, who is researching an article on New York's finest.<br /><br />The evidence on the balcony is Matthew was pushed.  The inquiry follows up with an interview with the deceased's trophy wife twenty eight years old Kimberly after their seven year old son is taken out to play by the nanny.  Soon the cops know she lies about her alibi and her affair with Barry Gable.  They also learn from Matthew's accountant that Starr was broke as confirmed by the bare office though his penthouse was loaded with expensive art.  With suspects everywhere from lovers, bookies, and rivals, the heat is on but not from the murder case as it is from the attraction she loathes for Rook.<br /><br />This is an exciting rendition of the TV show as the police procedural is fun to follow although the romantic subplot never quite gels feeling forced to match the on air relationship.  The inquiry will hook fans of Richard Castle from the moment Heat takes charge with her only thorn being the Rook that seems to want to castle her queen.  Entertaining, this is a fun NYPD novella as kick-butt Nikki with pain in the butt Jameson along with her staff work the murder mystery.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0385341008|5.0|I read it and re-read it to my 92 yr. old mother-in-law within two weeks time. LOVE THIS STORY. To create a novel thru letters is very creative and the content is so easy to follow.  The story line builds up the characters so much that you can sense each of them thru their daily lives and feel as if you too would like to live in Guernsey. I don't want to give away the story but it was so hard to put down once I opened the book.  Love the author's sensitivity to all the characters created in this fictional tale.  Great writing.  Have recommended it to several people already.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is a wonderful story told beautifully through the art of animation.  My favorite all-time Disney movie by far.
B002TYZKIM|2.0|This Is It shows Michael Jackson rehearsing for what would have been a series of concerts at the London's O2 Arena.    For me the most fascinating part of this film, was hearing Michael Jackson delivering incredible Live Vocals on Earth Song, Billie Jean, Man In The Mirror and made me what a great show MJ just singing live with reduced dancing and NO lip synching would have been, you would have had a Kick-ass LIVE ROCK CONCERT.    This wasn't really a documentary as much as Kenny Ortega would have you believe, because if it was, it would have documented the events of June 25 2009, which is the entire reason MJ isn't on stage - the film forgets to mention this.    It was also very poorly edited and cut.  To begin you should have had MJ announcing the O2 dates at the arena, you then go back in time to the LA STAPLES ARENA and show a stage being constructed for live rehearsals and then film Michael Jackson arriving for DAY 1 of rehearsals as well as overdubbs of MJ talking about how he envisioned the show etc.    To end the film, they should have shown an empty and derelict O2 arena on what would have been the opening night, with a poster outside saying \\"Michael Jackson Concert Cancelled\\" - because this would bring home to every person, that this is something you will never see Michael Jackson doing again ever !!!!    They need to re-edit this film big time !!!!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Edit as of 11/16/09 - Received my new headset from Amazon and this one is a lot better. I don't have to hold in the mic anymore but there is still the occasional echo. Also, some popping still occurs. So besides these little annoyances every now and then, I would recommend this to my friends. While still not perfect, what is these days, it come close!    I have had this product for a week now and when playing a game that doesn't require chatting, it is awesome. Games like Oblivion and Forza 3 sound great. If you are a playing a game that requires in game chat, such as Call of Duty, it is not great. That sound is great with Call of Duty, but the mic connector that goes into your headset doesn't seat properly. This in turn, causes you and everyone to echo and they also become hard to hear (faint voices) because it is not seated properly. The solution is to press upward on it hard and it will work for a little bit then get loose again and the cycle continues. The female connector in the headset needs to be fixed by Turtle Beach in order for it to hold the male (line in part) securely. If not, then it will just become loose again, even if it just a millimeter or two. It is enough for echoing and poor in game chatting. Also, everyone says I sound muffled compared to the regular Xbox mic.    Bottom line, if you don't play games that require in game chat, then dig right into this baby because sound is great. If you require in game chat, then seek other alternatives.     I have requested a replacement to see if I have a bad headset but I really don't think that is the case. If you go to the Turtle Beach forums, there are many people with the same problems. I am hoping that the replacement will work because it really is a great for sound.    Hope this helps.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|Season Two has some of the greatest episodes. There is a whole disc devoted to the \\"Trouble with Tribbles\\". I find myself watching the show in amazement at the stunning color and clarity that just was not technically possible with earlier versions of the series releases. Season two has more advanced character development between Kirk, Spock, McCoy ect. The writers had more latitude to polish and explore more depth into the main characters. I love the chemistry that existed on TOS. I now have both season one and two and will soon be ordering season 3 with it's release coming December 15, 2009. I must say that I do not watch the \\"enhanced\\" versions of the show but prefer the original special effects just as I remember them from my childhood in the 60's. Even though they used models and some crude effects, I prefer them to the digital stuff that seems somewhat out of place. The digital effects seem two dimensional and flat to me. Call it a personal preference but I like my Star Trek original and straight up. Cheesey or not...I think they really did a fairly good job with the models and camera tricks of the day.  Another great quality of the Blu Ray discs is the wonderful sound quality. Everything is crystal clear and consistant. The discs from season 2 seem to load a bit slower than season 1 on my Sony machine. Not a great distraction though.  I have been extremely happy with my purchase and enjoy watching the original Star Trek with my 3 daughters. The new movie which was released this summer really helped to build excitement with the younger crowd too.

B00138F5ZS|4.0|I think this album while it isnt one of her best its not one of her worst. This album inspired Liza Minnelli to do her own French album with also mixed results. Since I dont know french i enjoy those songs but havent a clue what they mean. An album of spanish songs would have been so nice to have also! I think that this album is a pass for casual fans but a must have for ardent fans.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|I was truely looking foward to seeing this movie in hopes it followed a recent long list of good action flicks. Wow was I disappointed, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie had it all (in a bad way), terrible acting, poorly written script, and as someone else mentioned special effects that make Jurassic Park seem state of the art. Stay away from this movie, hopefully they don't make another one of these, but sadly the way this story goes I'm sure they will.

B002RB7VMA|4.0|I really wanted to like this album. It has a range of singing styles from Motown to big band to few new tracks. There is something for everyone on CD but it isn't quite for me.  \\"Crazy Love\\", \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\"  are the few that I have listened to more than once.  I've always liked \\"Crazy Love\\" even when McKnight sang it.  This album will not disappoint but may not blow you away either.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|I have been a Muse fan since I first heard Time is Running Out on the radio. Since then I have gone back to listen to older CDs and found out how impressive they are. Hard to find a bad track by them.    This is not their best album, although I wouldn't be quick to rank them in any particular order. It is different and awesome in its own right. Do yourself a favor and listen to something other than Uprising, it's the weakest track on the album in my opinion.
0696204800|3.0|For a new quilter, this book of 501 patterns is wonderful to read and look at the finished work but I find the instructions difficult to non-existent. I wouldn't give up the book for the world and, if you can purchase a used copy for $3.00, I would go for it but don't expect to be using their quilting patterns. The finished quilts are lovely to look at and might give you ideas but then you'll need to purchase a book with actual quilting patterns. The quilt squares are only 4\\" which also makes them difficult for the beginner. If you are an advanced quilter, you might more out of this book than I did.
0316017922|3.0|I picked up Malcolm Gladwell's book Outliers after viewing him on an interview with Charlie Rose.  What I found intriguing was his explanation of why Asians are good at math.  Gladwell claims that it is a combination of working hard and how numbers are heard in the Chinese language, which according to Gladwell is more logical.  According to him, the work ethic derives from having to cultivate rice, which takes a good deal of labor and SKILL.  I thought it was a bit far fetched.  I still think so.  There can be numerous other cultural explanations other than the one he proposes.  China also has an internal control, a northern region that is predominantly wheat growing.  He talks about this in a footnote saying that no studies have been done yet.  Too bad, because otherwise the arguments are awfully faulty.  Then again many of the arguments in the book are.      Success it seems rises from many different conditions (Didn't we already know that?).  For Gladwell culture is an important component of determining success at any given field.  Opportunity is another component.  When opportunity and hard work comingle, then success is a result.  Didn't we already know this?  Charlie Rose asked him the same thing, and Gladwell said that the reason for his writing the book is that we don't seem to SAY this as a society but instead claim it is all due to hard work alone.  I think this is FAIR for Gladwell to say.  I think this is the main point of the book.  Opportunity is important too.      The book is well written and I think the first half is more interesting than the last half, especially chapters 1-4.  It is actually an interesting book if you are going to have kids; you can learn what to do to raise successful kids, like schedule 10,000 hours of practice (of what I don't know; a very few know what they want to do as a child).  While Malcolm Gladwell doesn't say it, success seems to be sowed at an early age.  You can also amuse yourself by wondering what went wrong if youare not currently successful.  Sad to say, it may be too late.  Oh well.
0439023491|5.0|It must be difficult to write a hugely popular book, like The Hunger Games, and then have to produce the sequel and not suffer the dreaded Sophomore Slump. Suzanne Collins need not worry, for Catching Fire is a terrific follow-up to book one. It's hard to keep up the pace in the middle book of an expected trilogy, the first book lays the groundwork and the final book is the resolution and frequently the middle book has none of that excitement, but that is not the case here.<br /><br />It's also very difficult to review a sequel that gives nothing away from the first book and doesn't reveal any spoilers for the second book. Therefore I will note here that there are spoilers ahead for The Hunger Games, so if you haven't read it yet stop reading here.  There will be no spoilers for Catching Fire, just a general review of the story and characters.<br /><br />***SPOILER SPACE for The Hunger Games***<br /><br />At the end of Book One Katniss and Peeta have upended the 74th edition of The Hunger Games, placing the Capitol in the position of letting them both be declared winners. Upon returning back to district 12 the two try to pick up their lives, but everything has changed. They are celebrities now and we rejoin their story as they prepare for the Victory Tour through the Twelve Districts. As they make their way through the tour, visiting one district every month, it is clear that there are signs of unrest and rebellion, fueled by Katniss' act of defiance during the last competition. It's seems as though the Capitol and President Snow have not forgotten their stunt either and have planned their revenge; it is an act of retaliation that sends tremors through all of Panem.<br /><br />To reveal anymore would ruin the book for all. However Collins manages to keep the tension ratcheted up as the 75th Hunger Games begin and we are introduced to more characters to root for and against.  The triangle between Gale, Katniss and Peeta is ongoing and there are twists, turns and betrayals that you won't see coming. The ending is a cliff hanger that will have you clamoring for the next book now!!ayals that you won't see coming. The ending is a cliff hanger that will have you clamoring for the next book now!!
0385504225|4.0|The book is an other Dan Brown classic. I read it in 2 days; the thrill and surprises were very satisfactory. After Paris, London and Rome now we learned a lot about Washington DC's history and monuments. Book push me to do a lot of research on internet about neotic science.  If I compare this book with in The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons;  I believe the author achieved  have much better and detailed character descriptions which made them more real and more believable. I felt he became a much better and confident in writing.     However I have a few negative comments; what is it about Turkish prison story? That was true 20 years ago, Please, have you check how Turkey is today? May not be 100% developed and G8 country but do not have such prisons any more, not since early 90s. Please do not trash a country without checking the facts, not in a book which sells millions all over world that brings a responsibility.    The philosophical discussions after the trill was over, about one true god and lost word being the bible, etc.  was much too long. Even though I agree 100% with the ideas and facts stated I got bored on some of the pages.    Finally; I have read all Dan Brown novels, I am still a big fan. I will buy when ever he will write a new book but still my favorite is  Angels & Demons. Lost symbol was not able to change that

B002GY9F9K|1.0|One of the worst adaptations of a book series I've ever seen. If the director or writer could change something important in the book, they did.  Even from the minute Richard walks on the screen, he's wrong. He's supposed to be a powerful, strong woodsman and not some scrawny short guy who looks like he's 12.  The casting of Zed too is wrong (with Kahlan they did a little better), which detracted from my enjoyment of the series in a big way.  Thank God a friend lent it to me so I didn't buy it as I'd be really upset if I'd actually spent money on this.  Terry Goodkind must have been incredibly disappointed with this series after holding out so long to get it made the way HE wanted it. This isn't anywhere close to his vision of the books - absolute schlock! Wish I could have given it ZERO stars!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I wouldn't have said that Michael Buble was my favorte singer.  I liked the sound of his music but haven't gone out of my way to listen to him.  Then I got this album and I am in love.  I adore the song \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\"!  I like every song on the album and it has been a great companion on my long commute the past few weeks.  Right now this is my go to album when I just want to hear some good songs.

This one was more of a mystery - with a very unpredictable plot! I enjoyed reading it, and it reminded me of those \\"Satanic\\" murders that those three boys were blamed for, but that the HBO documentary, [[ASIN:B00B15ODQU Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills]] made seem like it was obviously the stepfather... Anyhow, this was an original story with an interesting structure. Highly recommended!

B000WGN3YM|5.0|I'll keep it short: I love this album. EST sounds great, at the top of their game. The compositions are strong. As I say in the title, it's the kind of album that makes you want to approach people and say \\"Have you heard this?\\"
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I am super excited to review this album. I love nothing more than getting finding a new band that completely exceeds all expectations and Halestorm certainly do that.<br /><br />The album kicks off with a rocking lead of 'Its Not You' and it carries on from there. Lead singer Lzzy has a strong voice with good character, she has depth and shadow in her voice that isn't found often these days. I'm not really into the whole' Screamo' thing when it comes to the harder style of music, I like when the girls sing, and boy does she.<br /><br />Other highlights are the unforgettable 'Familiar Taste Of Poison' it's haunted me for days, and I also youtubed the video featuring the True Blood cast...<br /><br />Possibly my fave track would have to be 'Innocence', there's something about the song that keeps me coming back to it.<br /><br />Truely a standout album, people have been calling them the 'new' Evanesence, I don't think that at all, Lzzy's vice is miles away from Amy Lee's, the music may sound a little like the now defunct band but it has more commercial quality.<br /><br />I just ordered my second copy for my best friend for christmas....thats how much I am into Halesotrm.<br /><br />Well done guys (and girl)
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This film was an amazing last footage of Micheal Jackson he was a brilliant artist. The man had so much talent, and yet it was sad to see how pale he looked in his last moments. This DVD is worth the purchase for a true Michael Jackson fan.  My heart goes out to his family.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Finally, a badass bond. No reliance on gadgetry or tricks. Just a cold, ruthless spy/assassin, willing to do whatever necessary to get the job done.     Beautiful transfer, this high def experience is something worth showing off.
0307276902|5.0|Although it's years later, I picked this book up not knowing about its controversy or its history.  I just read the book because it seemed interesting. It's the best book I've read in a very long time, and it made me think, made me feel, and made me reflect deeply on myself and my life. No wonder it was successful.  I read the book believing that everything was true, but assumed some of it was probably a distortion of memory because of the detox process (such as being dragged into a corner in the medical unit and waking up there the next day. I assumed he may have been there a short time but FELT like it was overnight.)<br /><br />The day after I finished it, I immediately googled James Frey.  I was so curious about what he looked like now, where his life has taken him, and whatever other interesting tidbits.  It saddened me when I discovered the incredible controversy of this tale.  I have thought long and hard about it, and I decided that I really don't care.  I really loved reading this book, and it was very real for me as I was doing so.  I feel that it brought to the surface some things I've been feeling about my life, and helped me understand why I do some of the things I do.<br /><br />I feel sad that James suffered with so much criticism over this book.  I read the part of the book that they are inserting, and I think if that had been in the book when I read it, that it would not have mattered to me one way or the other.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this book.  And I'm glad James has his wife and family to support and love him, and I'm glad he is still sober today.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|I bought this CD without thinking about it.  I am a big fan of Michael and own all of his other Cd's.  This time I am disappointed in his song selection.  These are not great songs nor would I listen to most of them.  I guess this is just the type of CD I would put on in the background while you had people over for cocktails and didn't really have to listen to it.  He can do better!

0545123267|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book.  Maggie<br /><br />Sam and Grace are the main characters through which \\"Shiver\\" is told. Both of them are easy to fall in love with and simply adore.  Actaully, I liked how all of the charcaters were done in this book.  They were expertly written, never flat and very likeable. Maggie Stiefvater is and remains one of my favorite writers or the YA Genre.  The story flows without flaw between both characters, making it a story that will keep you reading throughout the night.<br /><br />Sam is a werewolf, and in \\"Shiver\\", werewolves are only human in the summertime and then in the winter, it's back to being a werewolf.  As time goes on the time that they are human becomes shorter and eventually, they are left to only be known as werewolves until they die.  This is the last summer that Sam will be human and he feel that he must show Grace the love that he feels for her.  I actually cried.  And, to be honest, I've never read a book quite like \\"Shiver\\" before.  I love it's individuality!<br /><br />Even though I cried, I have to say I laughed more. Maggie has a way with words and the prose itself is beautifully done! I loved the romance between Sam and Grace.<br /><br />I can't wait for the sequel! I highly recommend SHIVER!
0061120073|5.0|I will never forget Francie Nolan and her family. Reading this book has given me more appreciation for all that I have. It has given me hope that magnificent can come out of poor and uneducated. The characters were deep, the details colorful.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|It started out like the same old same old James Bond movies but after about an hour it began to develope into a descent movie.  I don't know what I was expecting from Bul-Ray but the quality didn't seem anymore impressive to me than a good HD movie on  TV. I'm fairly new to the Blu-Ray so that may not be a fair evaulation but, in any case it's mine, for what it worth.

B000G0O5N2|4.0|The movie it's self wasn't much and the quality of the Blu-ray was okay but, not impressive.
B000H6SXMY|3.0|The DVDs are generally fine, although this is NOT the official DVD Friends boxset. It's a copy and doesn't come with the standard booklet that comes with the real DVDs (although it's really not a big deal since that booklet has nothing useful in it but some glossy images and fluff). The DVDs are wrapped in a loose plastic container which was weird. But the DVDs work fine. Only complaints are the menu button only goes to the general disc menu, not the episode guides, and the DVDs will run repeatedly for hours on end unless you specifically turn it off. Also I think I'm missing disc 36. They should really say this is not the official licensed DVD!
1881273156|4.0|I first discovered this book in the hair salon. My stylist was discussing her recent purchase of this book with her clients. I picked it up for myself and I love it. It's a must read! It taught me so many things but it also taught me that I did not know as much as I thought I did. This book can be applied in all relationships, not just ones with significant others. But, if you are alone, I suggest you pick up one of his other books. Either way, he does not disappoint.
0316069906|4.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. It is incredibly well-written, smart, informative, incisive, compelling, edifying and outright heroic. I read the whole thing with one hand on the book and the other clutching my throat in horror. A few months before reading it, I'd become a vegetarian. But I still ate fish, reasoning that they'd had their natural lives in the wild and that they didn't seem to have the same level of consciousness as mammals. I also ate eggs, paying a high premium for \\"free-range\\" and \\"cage-free\\" eggs, picturing those birds running around outside and unharmed. Giving up beef, poultry, and pork was hard (I had already given up lamb and veal). The difficulty of that pales, though, beside the imperative I now feel to give up fish and especially eggs, and probably dairy products as well. It's clear to me after reading this book that eating eggs is as bad as eating chicken, if not even worse -- in that \\"layers\\" seem to fare even worse than \\"broilers\\" in factory farms.    The hardest part of giving up eggs is sacrificing all the products made with them. It's easy enough, if painful, not to buy the eggs themselves. But how can I escape the fact that by eating challah bread and french toast and caesar salad and mayonnaise and birthday cake and countless other \\"vegetarian\\" choices, I am creating a demand for eggs -- and lining the pockets of those who supply them -- just as surely as if I bought them by the carton?    Foer mentions vegans many times in Eating Animals. But he does not apply the term \\"vegan\\" to himself. He identifies himself as a vegetarian only, and as another reviewer here pointed out, he ignores the plight of dairy cows. This is so ironic to me. Foer rightly asserts that it's immoral to eat meat from factory farms, and very regrettable not to examine one's choice to do so. He rightly urges his readers to abstain from meat and confront others who don't about the implications of their actions. He condemns the industry for resisting scrutiny by any means available to it, for essentially auditing itself and giving itself a pass at every turn. And yet if he is choosing to eat -- as listed above -- challah bread and mayo, etc., then he too is supporting factory farms, and I can't see any possible way he could deny this to himself or to his audience. But he does not clarify or discuss this at any point. And it's as if he's decided that since he chooses to continue consuming dairy products, it wasn't worth examining or presenting the plight of dairy cows -- a very conspicuous omission. In other words, he is doing what he accuses most Americans of doing -- making choices that enrich factory farms and not scrutinizing (in print, anyway) those choices.    Having said all this, he is still my hero for writing this book. He has single-handedly wiped out whole categories of food for myself and my family. I will press this book upon anyone I possibly can; I will give money to PETA; I will try to live out the second half of my life in keeping with what I now know. I hope Foer at some point will at least discuss his choice not to be a vegan, because by his own standards, that does not seem an unreasonable thing to expect of him.

They have two children and want to adopt a third child. Welcome to the big screen Isabelle Fuhrman, she plays orphan Esther in the movie. A very sweet child who loves to paint, but isn't really friendly with the other orphans.<br /><br />If your like me the first time I saw this preview, I was thinking, wow did they copy off the movie [[ASIN:B00013RC7K The Good Son]] with Macaulay Culkin or what? A bad girl who does bad things. I was wrong, \\"Orphan\\" has alot more to it then that.<br /><br />This movie isn't going to scare you, but it will shock you. It has a very creepy feel to it right from the time you meet Esther in the movie.<br /><br />I watch alot of movies and I can honestly say, I'm finding it harder and harder to be impressed by a movie. \\"Orphan\\" impressed me, big time. Everyone I know that has seen the movie, enjoyed it.<br /><br />Good movie, good acting, with a insane suprise twist that you will never expect!<br /><br />Enjoy~
0141040343|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw this movie on Oct. 31st and it was such a beatuiful moment.. I loved it and so did the rest of y family. I just bought it and im so glad that im one of the first that will own this amazing movie
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is a complete and well produced box set.  The sound is amazing.  You will hear things you never heard before on certain songs.  I cannot say enough good about it.  If you get it, you will not be diappointed.
1401323820|3.0|The series is light and fun, wish the book was longer, more in depth and developed the characters a little more.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|If you like/love Patrick Swayze and feel his loss the way all of us Baby Boomers do, then why not just own a copy? Yeah, the story is lame, that acting barely O.K., but who cares? Nothing makes us feel better than that last dance. The rest of the music is top notch and fun and the dancing fantastic. No one, but no one, would be caught dead dancing like that these days tho'or so it would seem. But again, who cares? It's also kind of fun watching the other dancers. Take a close look and watch them ham it up. It's hilarious. Also, having watched it several (who knows how many?) times, I finally noticed a young girl and boy who seemed to be showing up also in several key scenes. The producer's kids maybe? Bottom line, it was Swayze at his absolute best, gorgeous, hunky, sweet, perfect hair, beautiful shy smile. That's why we loved him in this movie and 'Ghost', I guess, and that's why we will miss him.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I was extremely upset when I found out that Michael Jackson passed away and I was even dreading to go see this movie because I thought it would be really sad. In a way it was. We no longer have Michael. He danced hard, and sang his heart out. Even though it was just rehearsal. I ended up crying through most of this movie. He preformed his greatest hits and his new song \\"This is It\\" But then after thinking about it later, this movie really was a tribute to him and wasn't supposed to be sad. I sat through the whole thing just hoping it would never end. I think Michael would be really happy this movie was made for his fans. We now have something to remember him by and I am trilled to be pre-ordering the movie. If you haven't seen it, I would encourage you to. It shows him at his best and also shows how kind and sweet he really was.<br />R.I.P Michael I love you now and forever!! There will *never* be another Michael Jackson.

B000KJU182|5.0|\\"Billy Budd\\", from Herman Melville's story, is directed by Peter Ustinov, and set at sea in 1797. Ustinov plays Captain Vere of the war-time British navy vessel on which the story unfolds. The angelic, pure hearted young Billy Budd (Terence Stamp in his first film role), is a psychological threat to the cruel Claggart(Robert Ryan), whom life has turned into a man who must destroy any sign of goodness. He no longer believes in it. He is filled with darkness and hatred. A situation develops which becomes a battle of Good versus Evil and a demonstration of a conflict between Justice and Law.  Ustinov, as the Captain must enforce the rules of the Navy - being ruled by his head, rather than his heart. His duty torments him to breaking point. This classic tale is an unforgettable experience, in gorgeous black and white Cinemascope. Black and white very well suits this film about polar opposites.  You also get commentary by Terence Stamp, and Steven Soderbergh.

B000N3ST3Y|4.0|If you are a passive fan who just wants most of the bigger radio hits, Turn It On Again: The Hits will probably suit you just fine. Granted, it is missing a few hit singles like \\"Man on the Corner\\" and \\"No Reply At All\\" (conveniently both on the Abacab album) but for a one disc collection, it meets expectations and unless you lived under a rock in the late 70s, 80s and early 90s - you probably know every track on this disc sans the remake of \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" which reunited Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett with Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford for the only \\"new\\" track for the die-hard collectors and fans.<br /><br />If you want something slightly more substantial, many people seem to recommend the [[ASIN:B000UYX5E4 Turn It on Again: Tour Edition]], which is two CDs and offers a bit more in the way of classic tracks along with a deep cut or two. Personally, I think that set pales in comparison to the [[ASIN:B000679QK2 Platinum Collection]], which is a budget priced 3-CD anthology that spans the band's entire career. More the more serious fan who wants more than 'just the hits' will be more satisfied with this than any collection out there (granted, you still don't get \\"Man on the Corner\\" or \\"No Reply At All\\" with Platinum Collection).
B002H3F7F6|3.0|OK...I like odd, and I like Sting, esp. the Police work, but this is a perplexing and odd (and not the good kind of odd...) piece of work to me.  It sounds like Sting's adopted a maudlin choir voice and many of the songs sound the same...and then, for weirdness, the Hounds of Winter, are thrown with a whole different sound..  I want to like it...I keep listening to it to give it a chance, but it feels like it might have needed T-Bone Burnett to make it a truly interesting CD (Think what Burnett did with Robert Plant/Alison Kraus--a great and odd album). And I love moody winter English songs...I just think this needed editing, a female counterpoint, and a whole lot more interesting treatment.

B002TYZKIM|2.0|When the cardboard cutout of Michael appeared in front of the bulldozer, this film showed how boring it was.  A performer who begins to believe his own hype, who doesn't bother to really rehearse with his dancers or musicians, yet expects them to \\"know\\" his material and what he wants...who prances back and forth doing a few dance steps that had been done over and over for years, and has dancers doing all the work and when the voice wasn't singing in tune and songs had to be growled out...it goes to show  that this man would never have made it to the tour dates.  He wasn't up to par, hadn't really worked on anything and all the \\"special effects\\" were still on computer...costumes weren't made, nothing was ready.  These rehearsals were glued pieces obviously showing he never finished a full song, but had bits and chunks cobbled together.  It did not show any type of genius...just re-runs of better times that happened 25 years ago.  The film was hyped to take in the fans....succeeded in that...but as an art/documentary...it was not revealing or barely watchable.  They should have left it in the box.

B002BSHXJA|3.0|As I see it there are three reasons to consider acquiring this set. First is nostalgia, second is authenticity and third is variety. If you were around in the 60's when The Beatles were in the process of releasing their output then the original mono mixes will have special sentimental value to you that will be lost on the generations that followed (including mine). Much has been said about how the mono mixes were the band's top priority with the stereo mixes relegated to little more than after thoughts. Hence they are to be deemed more \\"authentic\\" than stereo as they are what The Beatles \\"intended\\". While that may indeed be true, objective ears will tell you that the stereo mixes, whether 1987 or 2009,  sound much more modern than mono (after all, there is a reason the industry switched to stereo and left mono behind) and much more desirable for repeat listening. When all of the sound is centered the various elements each have to compete for your attention. But with the separation of stereo you can hear them in much greater detail. Therefore my advice is to go with stereo if you are still considering which version to get. If you bought the stereo box and are having remorse, don't. Overall the stereo mixes sound better than the mono. As for the much hyped vocal and musical differences in the mono versions, they are largely overrated and will not enhance your enjoyment of the material as much as some would have you think. Yes, John does come in a little earlier in \\"Yellow Submarine\\" with his \\"life of ease\\" line, but, uh, so what? On the other hand you might want to have the mono versions just for the sake of variety as another listening option when you're in a Beatle mood. But only if you can afford it of course. One last comment regarding accusations of the 2009 releases being a rip off on the part of EMI; unless someone is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to reach for your wallet and buy one or both of these box sets give it a rest. You are under no obligation to buy them. And you'd better believe that if I owned the rights to the most popular song collection in the history of recorded music I'd be out there finding ways to reinvent and repackage it too. It's just common business sense!
0143113100|1.0|The most fascinating thing about this book is the nearly complete lack of honest critical response to Doidge's book.<br /><br />Doidge, a Freudian psychoanalyst, has no training in neurobiology, and prior to this book has published next to nothing relevant to the topic.  He makes two fundamental errors in the way he tells his story.<br /><br />The first of these is the division he makes between \\"localizationists\\" and \\"neuroplasticians\\".  No one working in neuroscience would take seriously the straw man position that Doidge puts forth for localizationists, that there is \\"one location, one function\\" and that the brain operates as an unchangeable machine.  It is one of the most fundamental axioms of neuroscience that neural changes underlie any learning mechanism.  No one would seriously postulate that brains *don't* change a great deal during the life of an organism.  Even those involved in the practice of understanding how functions are localized (e.g., speech in the left hemisphere) would not suggest that there is anything special or unchangeable about the physical location, that this location couldn't change after brain injury.  Mainstream neuroscience, not a marginalized fringe, has long been aware of the adaptations and plasticity that can happen after a stroke or other brain damage.  Doidge seriously misrepresents himself as the champion of a movement.<br /><br />The second error is the implication that brains are infinitely malleable.  He presents a cherry-picked set of case studies and select experiments that might suggest that this is the case, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest exactly the opposite conclusion.  Doidge even goes as far as to intimate that any neurological condition can be fixed with the right training.  Autism, dyslexia, maybe even Alzheimer's.  This is seriously misleading at best.<br /><br />One of the traps that Doidge falls into is the excessive use of \\"brainspeak\\".  Many of the examples and implications that he talks about are behavioral, and a brain description is really not the appropriate level.  After a while, the term \\"brain map\\" has lost a good deal of it's punch as it's applied to anything at all.  He suggests that Freud was ahead of his time because, in essence, psychotherapy is \\"changing your brain maps\\".  Well, yes.  But so is any learning at all; there's no privileged place for psychoanalysis.  In essence, Doidge is trying to convince you that evidence for brain plasticity should let you know that YOUR brain (and life) can be changed.  But in many ways the brainspeak is an unnecessary diversion.  The world is full of stories of personal triumph, and those enough are evidence that personal triumph is possible.on is really not the appropriate level.

I never thought I would hear anything more stupid than intelligent design ever, but apparently I was wrong. The psudo-philosophical arguments among characters in this book are not intelligible enough to fool a four-year-old. This is a prime example of  what goes as a literary work in our times when a book like this sells so much.     And, for those who want to claim that this work has its own virtues since it is entertaining: NO, IT IS NOT! I was jumping paragraphs at the end to get this finished as quickly as humanly possible.     I AM GLAD I NEVER PAID A PENNY FOR THIS BOOK!

1416594787|5.0|A marvelous book, very well written, a thorough exposition of evolution by a true believer, pitched at the popular (introductory college) level. I always prefer to have things explained by true believers, particularly if they are well-written and break away from the cliches on the subject. With some minor quibbles, this book does that quite well.  I predict that in time it will become a classic, perhaps even a notch better than Dr. Sean Carroll's excellent [[ASIN:0393327795 Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo]] and Dr. Jerry A. Coyne's [[ASIN:0670020532 Why Evolution Is True]], both of which Dr. Dawkins (and I) recommend.<br /><br />For those who know Dr. Dawkins as a rabid atheist and polemicist, this book is a welcome waft of fresh air. To quote, (p5) \\"This is a book about the positive evidence that evolution is a fact. It is not intended as an anti-religious book.\\" Personally, I would re-word this slightly to \\"positive factual evidence for evolution.\\"<br /><br />Almost always he delivers on this promise, but he cannot resist the occasional dig at \\"creationists\\" in various asides, which all appear to be of the crazy-aunt young-earth variety. Surely he knows some creationists who are not of the crazy-aunt variety (surely he must know Owen Gingerich [[ASIN:0674023706 God's Universe]]?) It would be like equating \\"evolutionists\\" with Hitler or Lenin or Mao (who indeed carried out social evolution to its pathological extremes). Not fair on either side. Fortunately, these examples are almost incidental, and do not detract from the genuinely excellent exposition.<br /><br />His crazy-aunt stance leads to statements such as this (p. 130),<br />\\"There is a comic sequel to this triumphant tale of scientific endeavour. Creationists hate it. Not only does it show evolution in  action; not only does it show new information entering genomes without the intervention of a designer, which is something they have all been told to deny is possible ... it also undermines their central dogma of `irreducible complexity'.\\" Well, I'm a creationist with many friends of a similar persuasion, and we see the Lenski research and applaud it. Especially for its careful scientific methodology, which is not always the basis for the more extreme claims of evolutionist true believers.<br /><br />On that subject, however, I am not convinced that this research says as much as Dr. Dawkins asserts. The extended laboratory experiment which tracked a number of strains of e-coli for over twenty years, with truly remarkably prescient planning is an outstanding example of true science. The experiment regularly led the e-coli strains to near-starvation to force (I assume) evolutionary change. The denouement came with one strain at generation 20,000 or so when it switched its genetic make-up so that it could more efficiently process food. The result was indeed remarkable and unambiguous, but I think the explanation would require more proof before I accepted it as an evidence of true evolutionary innovation. The problem as I see it is that the e-coli genome is relatively large and has built-in several alternative ways to conduct metabolism, depending on the availability and type of food. The default assumption, then, would be that starvation activated one of these built-in alternative metabolism paths. It is not obvious that the observed results were really evolutionary innovation in the sense of creating new genes.  Perhaps so, but Dr. Dawkins' argument is not persuasive. It would be interesting to follow-up the Lenski \\"evolution\\" with a detailed sequencing of the e-coli just before and just after the switch. That would at least show precisely where the change occurred (although sequencing in itself would not necessarily reveal changes in the gene expression).<br /><br />In his defense of evolution as \\"fact\\" Dr. Dawkins mixes science with metascience. True science cannot exist without metascience, but  metascience cannot be asserted with the same confidence (as \\"fact\\") that is possible in science. Both are needed, but should be presented with some modesty and room for alternative views (not notable virtues in Dr. Dawkins!) The data of science are indeed factual, but the data of metascience are assumptions and hypotheses which can never rise to the level of fact, however reasonable or compelling they may be.<br /><br />An example of metaphysics is the \\"hairpin\\" assumption (pg. 25) \\"[F]or any two animals there has to be a hairpin path linking them, for the simple reason that every species shares an ancestor with every other species.\\" This is not a provable \\"fact\\" -- it is a metaphysical assumption.  In my metaphysics, relatedness (common genes, etc.)  does not necessarily mean descent from a common ancestor; it may simply mean creation (either by fiat or through natural processes) by a common creator: God can certainly re-use genetic code, if being the creator means anything at all. My point is that this is not a statement, much less a fact, of science. It falls into the realm of metascience, and should not be presented as scientific fact.<br /><br />My own metaphysical view is that God uses natural processes whenever they suffice to achieve an intended result. And since all living species have a (demonstrable) large amount of developmental flexibility, there is a lot of room for evolutionary change that can result in species divergence. But these things should be proved by scientific experiments (as astrophysicists do with stellar evolution). What cannot be proved by scientific experiment is the universal hairpin, although I have no objection to it being part of Dr. Dawkins' metaphysics.<br /><br />Along these lines, I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Dawkins' explanation of why the males of many bird species have gorgeous plumage even though that would seem to make them vulnerable to predation (p62ff). At the same time I would note that this observation is only a (perhaps reasonable) hypothesis. It is far from \\"fact\\" which would be evident if some other brilliant insight provided an alternative interpretation. Facts don't change. Meta-facts do.<br /><br />At one point Dr. Dawkins mentions computer simulations of evolution, such as his Blind Watchmaker program (pg. 40). In my view these simulations are a great way to test development rules by following their consequences: but one must follow up in the lab to show that the assumed underlying rules exist in reality! These simulations don't prove evolution; they show the consequences of evolutionary assumptions, which can then be the focus of laboratory experiments. I say this as a person with a lifetime devoted to scientific computer simulation.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great resource book for examples of evolution, and will undoubtedly become a well-thumbed book appreciated by both evolutionists and creationists.<br /><br />HMS Challengern science.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|There's nothing I can add about the songs that hasn't already been written except to say they are timeless jewels. It's hard to believe that not one of the songs on RS made it high enough to be a \\"1\\"!     So let's talk about the next most important part: the sound quality. Simply put, it is absolutely remarkable. I have the 80s release of other Beatles albums and the sound is okay (translation: marginal but tolerable for general listening). Before buying the Rubber Soul 2009 remaster, I thought \\"1\\" sounded pretty good, given that the original recordings were done on what is now prehistoric equipment. I was simply not ready for the the crisp, vibrant sound of RS 2009 release. It sounds great in the car, on the home stereo, and on the IPOD as an MP3 (ripped with EAC 0.99pb5 and Lame 3.98.2). Simply \\"WOW!\\" isn't strong enough.    I bought the Rubber Soul remaster to see if it was worth getting the others. Okay, it is and I will. I can't wait to get the rest of the collection. And if you didn't already know, this CD is in stereo even though it doesn't say so on the cover. It's based on the George Martin stereo mixes done in the 80's, which I prefer over the mono mixes.

B002NXSRX4|3.0|Why put the special feature on the same disc as the digital copy??? There is enough room on the Blu-ray disc for everything. Now I have to take out disc one (Blu-ray) to watch the the special features on disc two (dvd). The same thing was done with Hellboy II. Movie on the Blu-ray disc & special features on the digital copy disc (which is a dvd). The dvd nowadays aren't handled with care as Blu-ray discs,  so most dvd's are scratched or have fingerprints when you take them out of the package.<br /><br />Why not make a real 2 disc edition on two Blu-ray discs (LIKE YOU DID WITH TRANSFORMERS 2) & have the digital copy separate on a dvd that you can get rid of when it cannot be used anymore. Most of these so called 2 disc editions are just a 1 disc edition with a digital copy that can't be used after a certain period or after a couple of downloads.<br /><br />I have to take away stars because of how Paramount handled this release.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|NORTH BY NORTHWEST is one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, no doubt about that. I won't bore you with a review of the film (as so many \\"armchair critics\\" do), but I will let you know that this Warner Bros. restoration is STUNNING.  Warner Bros. went back to the original VistaVision elements and treated us to a NBN DVD that is amazingly sharp and perfectly color balanced. The \\"old\\" DVD looked good, I was perfectly happy with the transfer, BUT, (get a load of what lay hidden for years) this 2 disc 50th ANNIVERSARY EDITION is beyond my greatest expectations - Replace . . . REPLACE that old copy NOW, if only for the fantastic SPECIAL FEATURES. Here are the treats in store for you:     * New 2009 Documentary Reveals The Master's Touch: Hitchcocks Signiture Style     * Acclaimed Feature-Length Career Profile Cary Grant: A Class Apart     * Explore in Depth the Movie's Innovations and Influences in the new NBN:       One for the Ages     * Vintage 2000 Documentary Destination Hitchcock: The Making of NBN     * Stills Gallery     * Theatrical Trailer     * TV Spot  As if that's not enough, there's a commentary track by Ernest Lehman (the screenwriter) - AND (!) a Music Only Track - One of the great Bernard Herrmann - Hitchcock collaberations!  This wonderful DVD is \\"for the ages\\"!
0385504225|3.0|I listened to the audio book version, which was reasonably well done. (Except for some pretty obvious audio inserts.)    One thing let me down more than anything in DaVinci Code.    The Lost Symbol's plot builds on a lie. Maybe this is one of those \\"what do you mean by 'is' situations\\" where the wording is circumspect enought to let the lie be glossed over. As the climax was reached, I was angry to find that the villain's origin was based on deception. I really had the wind knocked out of me, thinking...how does Brown get away with this. Sure the story kept my interest, but now I find I was treated like a chump.    Like DaVinci Code, the ending is totally unsatisfying. Ten or more chapters of rambling esoterica that could have been condensed into a few summarizing paragraphs. The book could have ended with the fate of the protagonist.    Using \\"dead\\" commute time to listen to the book was enjoyable. I would have been immensly upset to have invested so much reading time in Lost Symbol to have had the tables turned on me as they were.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Everyone should see this movie, even if just as the best example of what the Italian Western is capable of. Spaghetti Western designation aside, this is a great movie, one of the best ever filmed. Superb.    I must say though, that fans of Leones trilogy starring Clint Eastwood may be better served to explore elsewhere first if looking to familiarize themseves with the Italian Western. This movie may be too big a leap, and as probably the best in the genre, it would best be appreciated after seeing some the lesser, but still great, contributions the the genre.     Not as rollicking as his trilogy of films starring Clint Eastwood, Once Upon a Time... has a somewhat more sombre tone, but is no,less enjoyable. A feast for the eyes.    The package is exceptional. Worth every penny. The special features are interesting and insightful. The print itself is gorgeous.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Great scenery, great story, great screenplay.  Heath Ledger was outstanding.  One of the top movies for 2005 easily.  Good job Ang Lee.  So much is told thru  the slightest of hints, not a wasted scene.
B000PC6Z48|4.0|Crucial for fans of Italian Westerns, not so crucial for the uninitiated.     People who dont like Italian Westerns will probably think this is the most ludicrous, unbelievable thing ever filmed. Italian Western fans will probably regard it as one of the better, most unique films in the genre. It's all about excess; excessive violence, excessive fire power, excessive villainy, excessive machismo, etc.     The direction is good, the acting is passable, the music is great. If youre a fan of this sort of movie you owe it to yourself to see it at least once. If youve seen the Leone/Eastwood films and are looking for a good place to start exploring the Italian Western, this movie will serve, but I would suggest Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence or The Hellbenders, as I think they are better films on the whole.    The package is great; nice print, widescreen presentation, interesting special features.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I have been a big fan of Michael Buble for years. Crazy Love is his newest offering and is an outstanding music CD. The arrangements are fabulous, and his singing has never been better!   I enjoyed the old standards but also thought the new songs were well done.  \\"Crazy Love\\", \\"Cry Me A River\\" and \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\" are my favorites.  This CD would make the perfect Christmas gift!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This is by far some of Michael Buble's best work. Although there is one song on the cd that I don't really like but all the rest is amazing. Especially the songs he wrote himself!

B002K54NLU|2.0|One of the books was replaced by another one.  E-mailed the seller and they never responded.  Tried to communicate with them to correct the wrong book.  Never had a reply.
0871137380|5.0|This is a good read.  I will most likely re-read this book every year or so.  Thanks for telling their story.
1400063515|3.0|The ideas presented in this book are essentially the same as those presented in Taleb's first book, Fooled by Randomness, just from a slightly different vantage point.  That said, I found Black Swan to be good but you could get the picture reading only Fooled by Randomness, which I thought was the better of the two, if so inclined.    Pros:  - This book will make you keenly aware of the existence of black swans (both good and bad) in almost every facet of life -- actually maybe this is a con because it might keep you up at night.  - Taleb offers tools such as fractil geometry as a replacement for Gaussian distributions (however, still not predictive).  - This text and concepts covered are engaging and thought provoking.    Cons:  - I do agree with other reviews that the book was repetitive.  Even more so after having read Fooled by Randomness.  I suspect that this book probably achieved so much success by riding on the coat-tails of Fooled by Randomness.    Other thoughts:  - Some may find Taleb's irreverance and style abrasive, but I actually kind of like it.

B002QP145C|5.0|This longer version is the full length version made for theatrical distribution. The shorter US version is edited version. The original TV version (5 parts) is 265 minutes. It was a big hit here in Finland. The only much bigger war film hit has been \\"Tuntematon sotilas\\" aka The Unknown Soldier, which has been filmed twice in Finland. That tells about the second war 1941-45 and especially the original 1955 version is here an institution, which was first an enormous boxoffice hit and later it has been showed almost every year on Independence Day in TV. But Winter War is  a legend here (I don't mean now the film but the actual war). Finlands unbelievable effort against Soviet Union preventing the possible occupation of the whole country. Here we have a saying used even today after any big effort or triumph. Well, it showed \\"The spirit of Winter War\\".
B002N1AERI|5.0|After the long anticipation of waiting for Epica to release a new CD, it is finally here! I'm not one to write reviews on every CD I like, but I think this one deserves it. I truly believe this is one step forward for Epica once again. There isn't one CD by this band I could really say stands out as my favorite because they all have their ups and downs. With Design Your Universe, the band decided to go for a more \\"heavier\\" sound and prove why they belong in the symphonic metal genre. Many will argue it's a bad thing and many will probably say it's good for them. I am one of those who says good for them! Fans of \\"Consign to Oblivion\\" may not be too happy with this change as that was the only CD with very few of Mark's repeated growling, and altogether the CD had a more soft side to it.<br /><br /> On this CD most of the tracks feature the growling, and as an added bonus, way better choirs. Epica also did something they have never done before-- they added guitar solos. I felt this was missing for a long time from their music and kept wondering when they would add them in. They belong in the songs and they definitely don't take away from them. Simone sings in a much more variety of ranges and goes from sounding almost \\"pop\\" like to her usual operatic voice. The band has also added a Duet featuring Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica) and actually has two songs over 9 minutes long (\\"The Kingdom of Heaven\\" and \\"Design Your Universe\\").<br /><br /> \\"Design Your Universe\\" explores the topic of new breakthroughs in quantum physics and their 13 tracks as well as their lyrics revolve around this topic. Truth be told, I had to read their Wikipedia page before I even began to understand what they were singing about. A lot of times, Epica explores topics that seem very deep and something that you really have to explore on your own; re- read their lyrics before you even remotely began to see the light at the end of the tunnel telling you what exactly you're hearing. This however is something that sets the band apart from the other hundreds of female fronted symphonic metal bands. The fact that their messages are deeply hidden within their music makes you listen to them over and over again to figure it all out. They just released their new video \\"Unleashed\\" which is track number 3 on their new CD. I watched it on YouTube and I truly didn't understand it at first. Then I read an interview online with Mark where he went onto explaining that the video portrays a married couple who go home to their apartment and the woman's husband gets shot by burglars. The man dies, but his soul still lingers there and doesn't understand he's dead or why his wife can't see him. That right there is something that isn't very obvious on the first watch, but can eventually be figured out.<br /><br /> Epica seems to be always so convincing with their lyrics and messages, that sometimes hidden deep within there are corny bits to their songs and some things that make you just go, Why? This CD actually only had two tracks where those feelings evolved for me. The first one being the duet with Tony Kakko. \\"White Waters\\" is truly a beautiful love song, and Simone does a top notch job. However, Tony's vocals weren't up to par for me. It took away the credibility for me that this song was written by a symphonic metal band, it wasn't really powerful enough and actually brought me minutes of Deja Vu when I listened for the first time to Nightwish's first release where the male vocals were provided by Tuomas. The song is good, but the male vocals bad... The second time I asked why and this time I actually burst out in chuckles, this has never happened to me before, was on the song \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\". The song itself is really heavy, but somewhere along the way, somwehere in the middle to be more exact the song is just butchered for me. There is a spoken piece in there, I believe it might be Mark? (I am not one hundred percent sure on that) God actually speaks.<br /> \\"God: It's not your time<br />You have to go back... back!<br />Now!<br /><br />Guy: No, no, I don't want to return,<br />Please let me stay here, don't make me go back<br /><br />God: Go back, you've got work to do\\"<br /><br />The above was taken straight from their lyrics. Just reading it, it isn't bad, but give it a listen on the track and it sounds unconvincingly lame. Why? simply because the person playing God and the guy God is talking to is voiced by the same person (at least it sounds that way). There isn't a variety between the two people talking and it seems like the person is arguing with themselves in an almost schizophrenic way. It really ruined the heavy mood of the song, at least for me, and made the whole track rather unconvincing because by the time it was over, I was still stuck on the one spoken piece. However, none of these reasons are reasons why this couldn't be a five star CD and none of the tracks are bad. They are all awesome in their own right. Stand out tracks for me were \\"Martyr of the Free World\\", \\"Resign to Surrender\\", \\"Burn to a Cinder\\" and a very pretty slow songs  is \\"Tides of Time\\".<br /><br /> Once again a top notch release from Epica, and definitely one step forward. They don't seem to be the type of band that by their second or third release tone down and don't improve. Finally a band that actually gets better and better. They deliver the \\"goods\\" every single time and leave you with a release you don't get tired of listening to. This isn't something that will ever make it to the radio in the U.S.A. or something that you will hear blasting out of people's cars (although you might hear it from mine), but it is GOOD and they are talented. They weren't ruined by MTV or people's opinions and keep growing as a band.ck... back!   Now!

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Even though Whitney's voice has changed, this is the best CD that she has ever recorded (next to the Preacher's Wife Soundtrack). This is her first CD that I can listen to straight through to the end. I must add that I am a big fan. The music is current without trying to be Britney or Beyonce. My favorite songs are Worth It, Call You Tonight, For The Lovers, Nuthin But Love, I Got You, I Didn't Know My Own Strength, and I Look to You. The thing I love the most about this CD (besides her voice)is that there are no sad love songs on it. Salute comes close but it is so triumphant that it doesn't count. This is a feel good CD. As someone who listens to Christian music 98% of the time, it was a great buy for me.
0307454541|3.0|I liked this book and finished it in less than a week. Still, when finished, I felt like there were quite a few things that could have been better.<br />- Blomkwists investigation technique was not very convincing. He totally ignored all the people he didn't like. He never spoke to Harald. He avoided Isabella. He relied unquestioningly on everything Henrik told him. He avoided talking to Cecilia because he might not like the answer. In the book he got away with this approach, but he shouldn't.<br />- The Bible code was stupid. Nobody refers to Bible quotes in that notation. The significance of the Biblical references was shaky. They were there to prove Gottfried was insane and to give Blomkvist a clue. No further background whatsoever and nobody even wonders.<br />- Lisbeths hacking skills were a bit all to magical. All the time she just hacks into a computer and copies the entire hard disc just like that. Fortunately that is not so easy in the real world.<br />- Unnecessary and meaningless sex. Why the relationship with Erika? It has no relevance for the plot. Same with the sex with Cecilia. It happens and it goes away, no consequences whatsoever. Nobody ever gets jealous. Nobody ever feels abandoned. Cecilia seduces Blomkvist and dumps him and he barely blinks an eye. It is totally emotionless. Maybe Swedes are different (in which case I pity their hollow lives) but in my world it doesn't work like that.<br />- Bad ending. If only Henrik gave Blomkvist some useful information, he could just write an article on Wennerstr&ouml;m, redeem himself and the book would be finished. Now he has to spend another hundred pages to do just that.<br />- Wennerstr&ouml;m is extremely stupid. He can build an international criminal empire out of nothing, but he lives in an apartment where the main internet access is behind a simple code lock that has the same code as the lock on the front door, known by all residents of the building. He keeps everything on the same laptop. He continues using the same laptop even after he should have known that is was hacked. Of course he has to, otherwise the book would never end.<br />- Political subtext: businessmen can never be trusted. Henrik is the good one, but even he deceives Blomkvist in the end. Why? Because he is a businessman and businessmen can't be honest in Larssons world. They just do those things. Blomkvists worldview is very deterministic: people do what they do because of their background. There is no free will, with very few exceptions.after he should have known that is was hacked.

B001MEJY8W|4.0|I read so many positive user reviews on this film that I figured it was a keeper, not a renter. I purchased it and was pretty much struck dumb (numb) upon viewing it. I thought \\"what is it with the French films lately?\\" After 'Frontiers', 'Them' and 'Irreversible' I thought they'd gone as far as possible in assaulting the audience with truly unsettling stories and imagery, but this took the cake. This is not to say this is some mindless Hollywood gore-fest. This film is as deep as it is gut-wrenching. But as good as it is, I'm not certain I could handle another viewing.    The film opens with a young girl, bruised and bloody, running down the street of some dilapidated industrial park. She's rescued and healed (physically at least) but we soon find out she'll be screwed up and haunted for the rest of her life due to the brutal ordeal of torture she was subjected to during her kidnapping. As her parents are never found she is relegated to the care of an orphanage where she is befriended by another orphan. The two form a close bond and we hope this will lead to some degree of emotional healing.    Shift into the future where our heroine enters the home of some seemingly quiet, well educated, upper crust(ish) family, and proceeds to murder them. She phones her friend and tells her she has located the people who tortured her those many years ago. Her friend joins her and we now find out what all this was about.     That's as far as I'll go with the plot. The direction the story takes from this point on is even more peculiar. It's certainly original but not for the sake of originality in it's own right. There is method to this madness. As things unfold and the plot points come together (all the way the ironic ending) the viewer hopefully realizes this is a true cinematic experience. No warm fuzzies. No quick kill at the box office. This movie is made to endure.     Whatever others have said in regard to the brutality in this movie is totally correct. But buyer beware: This violence is accompanied by some true gravity. Until I saw this (and the other aforementioned films) I'm not certain I realized how truly pornographic the violence was/is in most mainstream movies.     This is a great piece of cinema for any who want to see that envelope pushed. But you may want to make sure you have the fortitude to see it through.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|Terry Leather is a shady car dealer in East London who finds himself in hock to a local gangster who`s putting the screws on everyone who owes him money.  Desperate for some quick cash, Terry allows a former friend and model to trick him into helping pull off a major bank heist, unaware that he and his buddies are actually being used by the British authorities to steal some scandalous photos that, if published, could seriously embarrass the royal family.  The potential blackmailer is a black radical who models himself on Malcolm X and who thinks he holds the upper hand with the authorities as long as he is in possession of the pictures, which he has put in a safety deposit box in Lloyds Bank.  Terry and his crew, unaware of the back story and convinced there is a fortune to be had for the taking, fall right into the authorities' trap, bearing all the risk should the scheme somehow fail, yet sharing in few of the rewards should it come off as planned.<br /><br />Based on an actual event that took place in 1971, \\"The Bank Job\\" is a solid, old-fashioned heist drama directed by Roger Donaldson with a super-abundance of suspense, energy and style.  There are twists and double crosses aplenty in the screenplay by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, which uses the bank robbery as a mere jumping-off point for a scathing survey of the London crime scene, ranging from the lowest levels of two-bit thievery to the upper reaches of police and governmental corruption. There's also just enough uniqueness in the setup to keep us from feeling we know where the story is heading while it`s still playing itself out.  Despite a rather large cast of characters, we're usually able to keep most of the people straight during the course of the drama, though there are a few moments in the back half of the film where a little more clarity might have been helpful.<br /><br />In a bit of a change-of-pace for himself as an actor, Jason Statham gets to shed his \\"Transporter\\" action-hero image in favor of a more recognizable working-class stiff and family man who happens to have a serious penchant for running afoul of the law.  Also compelling is  Saffron Burrows - a dead-ringer for a young Charlotte Rampling - who stars as the seductive go-between who lures Terry and his men into a plan that may well lead to their undoing.<br /><br />The Great Bank Robbery of 1971 had the dual effect of not only turning villains into heroes but of helping to purge much of the corruption and rot lurking in the top echelons of British society.  It's a fascinating piece of twentieth century history brought to vivid and memorable life in a gripping and stylish film.ecognizable working-class stiff and family man who happens to have a serious penchant for running afoul of the law.

0375854819|4.0|I bought this book because of the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" material, which wasn't quite what i expected.  The deluxe material consists of 2 VERY short chapters, the dwarf rune guide and the fold-out poster.    As always anything Paolini writes is good, even though it was a bit short.  The dwarf rune guide was on the other hand (in my opinion) a bit disappointing, it is a combination of different norse and Anglo-Saxon runes (Futhorc/Futhark)i personally expected a bit new.  The foldout-poster is rather nice, eventhough i wish it was larger and that i could hang it up
B000002AQQ|5.0|I love the movie and have watched it several times over. The songs are classics from an era long gone.   Each time I see the movie I say I wish I had the album. Unfortunately it is not available for download from either itunes or amazon.  I probably would have paid full price at a local store but fortunately did not have too.  I was able to find a new CD set for under $3.00  plus S&H. A great collection of songs and even if you don't like all of them there will be more than enough that you like to justify the purchase. The price made it a 5 star recommendation at full price it is a 4 star.
B00000266S|5.0|I never get tired listening to this CD!  It brings back memories from the movie each time I play it!  Movie fans should not miss this one!
0385504225|4.0|I still enjoy Brown's writing style, but his books are starting to get old.  I wonder if he should drop the Langdon character and go another direction.  The newness has just worn off.  I did get enthralled with reading this book and it kept my attention until the ending kept getting drawn out.  I expected the book to be over multiple times, but no, it just kept going on and on.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|With as many bands as there are out there, it's not all that difficult for them to come out with a few albums, and then for kicks and giggles, throw out a \\"Greatest Hits\\" package. But what's interesting about this as I sample these \\"hits\\", a good majority of the songs from these hit and miss bands have never had airtime at all - which would obviously constitute a hit - or the fact that often times they're lacking in quality, so they're used as a filler along side more popular songs. Now we all know as albums come out we have our personal favorites, but some of these songs may never make it as a single, let alone a \\"hit\\". But as for David Grohl's band, their \\"Greatest Hits\\" are actually hits, and then some.     Now don't go thinking EVERY song on this package has hit the airwaves a time or two, because they haven't - at least not where I'm from. But that doesn't make songs like \\"Breakout\\", \\"This is a Call\\" and \\"Skin and Bones\\" any less memorable, especially for the fanbase that has followed the Foo's how long...? Plus you've got a few little goodies like the new track \\"Wheels\\", which has become an instint classic, plus a wonderful acoustic version of Everlong -- a song meant to be done acoustic!     So really, the greater majority of songs found here are songs you can hear every day on the radio, which is not bad. It just shows how much of an influence the Foo Fighters have made to still be able to control as much airtime as they do. And for as many places as this band has been, it's nice to know old and new, fans can find a true-blue \\"Greatest Hits\\".
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Why? Why don't you release Star Wars on Blu-Ray?  Your greed has ruined the whole Star Wars experience for me.  Are you happy?  Go ahead and release a new dvd version with special packaging.<br /><br />PS: Please add Jar Jar to the original trilogy....He's so funny!!!

B0002YLC24|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this movie. You must watch the Before Sunrise first. It's more than your typical love story. The intelligent and candid dialogue makes the movie so intriguing and realistic.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I also didn't see it in 3d but both me and my 9yr old son loved it. When we left the movie theater my son said \\" I was glad I didn't watch in 3d because it probably would distract you from all the nice things in the story\\". I was very surprised by his insight but I think he might be right. There was a lot of action but it wasn't one of those movies were the action was the main thing. It was a great movie adults might even get more out of it then the kids.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Another great album for Mark Knopfler! The guy has done no wrong since I want my MTV, that is my only complaint of him. I love this album!
B002KVSJ64|5.0|It's hard to find a band who is as consistent as Breaking Benjamin all of their albums are excellent but this one is exceptional. It is their second best album behind Saturate. It is easily one of the best Rock albums of the year. If you are a fan of modern rock or of metal music or just something different and original I highly recommend you pick this album up.

And if you are new to the art, the contents will certainly help you to a quilt of quality. It covers every type of quilt block and the grid to achieve the block or perhaps find a new block inspired by the information.    Jinny has again achieved the the best of the best among quilters.
0061914177|4.0|I have this discussion with my wife at least once a year...    WIFE: My boss wants me to work a tradeshow.  ME: Great!  WIFE: No! It sucks.  ME: Why?  WIFE: I can't sell anything.  ME: I disagree. I think you can sell.  WIFE: Not this product. I don't care about it.  ME: Right. You can't sell it because you have no passion for it.  WIFE: I can't sell anything.  ME: Wrong. When you talk about bundt cakes, romance novels or \\"Top Chef\\" you are selling.  WIFE: What?  ME: You're passion is so strong for those topics that whoever you talk to wants to check it out.  WIFE: I do like bundt cakes.  ME: Yes, and everyone you talk to wants to learn more about bundt cakes because your passion is contagious.  WIFE: I should blog about my passion.  ME: Yes!    That's what this book is about and it's great!
0060930349|5.0|As an avid fan of American History, I consider this book to be a cornucopia of awesomeness. One need only read the other reviews here to know that this book is both surprisingly entertaining and amazingly informative. After four years earning my degree in literature, and reading only what the professor assigned me, this was the first book that I chose to consume in my free time, and it was one of the most rewarding reads of my life.    Also, if you are liberal like me, don't be daunted by the fact that Johnson is a conservative. For the most part he manages to be objective, and it never hurts to see how the other side sees things.
B0029LHW4U|4.0|I've been a fan since I heard their second album 'Dirt'.  I've since obtained their entire catalog and am not sorry for the purchases.  This group has helped me get through a lot of tough times in my life so far and I thank them for their great music.<br /><br />'Black Gives Way To Blue' is a really good album.  I had high hopes for it when I heard it was coming out and pre-ordered it.  I listened to the excerpts and was impressed that the old AIC sound was still there.  I'm not going to go through each song and tell you about this and that.  Just know that if you are as big a fan as I am and you DON'T buy this album, you have done yourself a disservice.
0312383320|4.0|Bounty hunter Stephanie Plum's latest bond jumper is Munch, a quantum physics genius who looks like a kid. Munch has been seen hanging out with a tall man who strongly resembles a vampire and disappears in a cloud of smoke. Mysterious super-bounty hunter Diesel shows up at Stephanie's apartment, telling her he's tracking his cousin Wulf Grimoire, the very man who has befriended Munch. Wulf doesn't mind twisting people's necks and leaving his hand print branded on their skin, and his pairing with Munch cannot be good. Both are unstable and Diesel suspects Wulf has found the perfect person to help him gain power to control the world. Stephanie and Diesel team up to capture the two miscreants, who have taken up residence in the Pine Barrens, home to the Jersey Devil and all sorts of weird persons and creatures.<br /><br />Stepping outside the Plum numerical series, Janet Evanovich offers her readers a fun romp with Stephanie and Diesel as they pursue Munch and Wulf. Add to this mix a monkey Stephanie is babysitting who seems more human than monkey and plays an integral part in the investigation. This is the perfect book to be read at Halloween, with some very strange goings on in the Pine Barrens, along with Diesel and Wulf, whose powers are a bit out of this world.
0882709194|1.0|To own Charles Darwin's Origin of Species with an introduction from Ray Comfort is like owning owning a history book on the Holocaust with a forward by Adolf Hitler. I'm not saying Ray Comfort is Adolf Hitler, I'm just saying you can expect the same adulteration of the subject matter. Ray Comfort is willingly ignorant about evolution and completely uninformed and thus has no place to be writing a forward to this excellent and ground-breaking piece of literature.    No credible biologist rejects evolution.    \\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\\" - Theodosius Dobzhansky
B002NOAF9W|1.0|It \\"appears\\" you are getting a lot of music when they market this as a 3 DISC + DVD Collection. The average joe will think 60 bucks for 3 CDs and a DVD is a good price. The average joe doesn't realize right away that one short CD was broken into two even shorter discs in order to raise the box set price. This price for 2 discs and a DVD doesn't sound like a good deal, so they made it 3 discs, which \\"appears\\" better.  The original 48 minutes of Stones Ya-Ya's tracks are on one disc.  Disc two has the five extra unreleased Stones tracks lasting only 19 minutes.  These two discs add up to just 67 minutes of music but one CD can hold 80 minutes of music. There is no reason to have two separate discs for the Stones tracks when both fit on one 80 minute disc with plenty of time left over. They only split these 67 minutes of music into a 48 minute disc and a 19 minute disc to charge 20 bucks more per box set.   The original Ya-Ya's release was limited to 48 minutes due to the limitations of vinyl forty years ago. There is no reason to carry the time limitations of vinyl over to CD in this box set. There is other Ya-Ya's material that could have been included in this set. For example, the song Sympathy for the Devil is still only in its shortened-for-LP version and not in it's full 4-verse glory (internet bootlegs of this are easy to find).   The Rolling Stones do not have any rights to these recordings. ABKCO and Universal has full creative control on how to release this box set. Unlike the recent Beatles remasters, this Ya-Ya box was done with no input by the band or band's estate. The record company doesn't have to be concerned with the overall legacy of the band. For the recent Beatles reissues, they worked years to release high quality music at a great value to their fans because it was their own name and reputation on the line. The band input that makes a great release is missing from this Ya-Ya's box set.  Thankfully record companies no longer use force to take control of recordings away from artists like the Stones. But sadly they once were able to, and this low value release is a product of those days. If the Stones had full control over any version of Ya-Ya's it would have been done much differently. And better.  40 years later the Stones versus Beatles competition continues, with the Beatles winning by releasing their superior Mono and Stereo Box Sets with better packaging and fair pricing. That's too bad, cause I always liked the Stones better.
B001STY9VI|2.0|I am a huge Depeche Mode fan.  The first CD I ever purchased was Music for the Masses in a long box.  They've had their good and bad albums.  Stuff I've loved and stuff I've been pretty meh on.  Their last album was so great.  I went to about four concerts for Touring the Angel and I just thought.  Man these guys still have it.  I was really excited for Sounds of the Universe and I have to say it was a big let down.  Luckily I bought the \\"Deluxe\\" edition, which oddly has a lot of the \\"out takes\\".  In most cases I find the Out Takes on the DE disc to be better than the stuff on the actual CD.  This CD is definitely mellow, but it's not the follow up to Playing the Angel I would have hoped for.
B002Q4U9YU|3.0|I really really like Michael Jackson a lot. His passing is truly a tragedy. I sincerely hope that This Is It is not it. This album offers some new material as well as some much awaited demos but mostly consists of previously released material. As many albums worth of unreleased songs he as done I truly hope that This isn't it and that more future releases will follow. Also worth noting is the slip packaging. I would recommend storing your disks in a different case lest they get scratched up over time putting the in and taking them out.
B002PL8SWY|3.0|A nice set; hey, it's the Stones, but Amazon has listed items that were supposed to be included, but aren't:  \\"12 X 12 replica of the original 1969 tour book and poster by Grammy Award© winning artist David Byrd, whose works include the commemorative poster from the original Woodstock Festival and the historic Fillmore East posters from 1968 to 1971.\\"  Again, the tour book and poster are NOT included. I took 2 stars off my review. C'mon, Amazon. False advertising!
B000ZECQ08|4.0|My main gripe with the previous Harry Potter movie \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" was that for some strange reason they took the longest of the books and turned it into the shortest Harry Potter movie to date.  The result was that I felt like I was watching the movie fly by on a speeding train, as it rushed from one key event to another without really taking the time to explore anything in detail.    Now we follow up with \\"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\\" and....what a difference.  There are plenty of cuts of course, no Harry Potter movie can be free of cuts without being waaaay too long.  But the movie's length was at least comparable to some of the others.  The 3 lead characters were as spot on as ever.  Michael Gambon finally brings a bit more warmth to his portrayal of Albus Dumbledor than he brought to the last few movies.  Tom Felton played Draco Malfoy with all the depth one would hope for in his most important role in the series.  Alan Rickman isn't seen too much as Severus Snape, but when he is he's as wonderful as ever.    I really think this may be the best Harry Potter film yet, and I was really starting to think after the last film that the story had gotten to big for them to manage in film.  Good work guys.
0385504225|1.0|I can't add much to the literary critique, especially Justin Lee's very nice review that kicks off all of the reviews for this book.    All I can say is this: I bought the book a few days after it was released. I read, maybe, the first three chapters. I couldn't read any more and I traded it in to a local book store that buys used books.    Dan Brown's writing style grates on me. His italicized sentences indicating what characters are thinking and feeling get in the way. Plus, the writing is just so bland. His descriptions of people and places lack precision and vividness. Here's an example: \\"Langdon turned the corner and spotted a tall man wearing an over-sized black hat.\\" That line doesn't appear in the book, as far as I know. But it's indicative of the kind of vague description I slogged through. How tall? What kind of man? What kind of hat? What do you mean over-sized?    Many of my favorite writers (John D. MacDonald, Lawrence Block, Ray Bradbury) would have described that man down to the number of hairs in each nostril - but do so in an entertaining, engaging way.     Dan Brown is very good at weaving technology -- and pseudo-histories -- throughout his books. At that, he is one of the best. But he lacks the literary talent to write vividly and compellingly. True, I turn pages when I read his books. But often just to get to the point, usually an inevitable point I know is coming anyway. So get to it, already!    Life is too short, and there are way too many brilliant books in the world, to read a Dan Brown novel. I thought The Da Vinci Code was great. Not because of its literary style but because it was a gripping story. With the Lost Symbol, I just didn't care -- not about Langdon, not about the codes and labyrinthine mysteries and secret societies, not about the resolution to the whole mess. I just couldn't get into it.    Speaking of the secret societies, the opening chapter of The Lost Symbol made me laugh. The heavy-handed inner dialogue was akin to mustache-twisting in villains in the era of Silent Movies. Something like this (in italics): \\"Little do they know I mean to do them harm. The fools! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\"    I'm sure The Lost Code will become another movie (hopefully better than the last one, which was dreadful!) quicker than you can say back-a-dump-truck-full-of-money-up-to-my-house. But it's not likely to be a movie I'll ever see, just as this won't be a book I ever pick up again.    Forget lost symbols. I wish Dan Brown had lost the manuscript to this book before it reached the publisher!
B002TYGZF4|5.0|This was originally aired on BBC radio, so I've had this in bootleg form since 2003 and it's regularly listened to. The performance is very good. It's about 90 minutes in length, hitting both studio albums (that had been released), plus a few from In Utero (still a year from release!). Some very rare songs are performed as well; tourette's, D-7 and The Money Will Roll Right In.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good. A little hotter than my BBC radio version and the crowd noise is slightly louder in some sections. There are flubs and various mistakes by the band, but I don't find this distracting.<br /><br />Highly recommended, 5 stars.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|As the title says Legend of the Seeker is an excellent show, a show with solid acting, strong chemistry between the actors, and decent special effects. As a fan of The Sword of Truth Series on which this show is based on I was pretty excited when I heard it was being made and a bit leery because most adaptations don't do the books justice - the exceptions to that rule being the Harry Potter movies and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.     I have to say as a fan there are some things I was disappointed about - the plotline of Denna was watered down, The Sisters of the Light story arc being cut, no Samuel the former Seeker and \\"pet\\" of Shota, so far no Nathan Rahl or any other of the pristinely gifted other than Jennsen. However while the show does not stick to the amazing and intricate story arcs in the books it does stick to the basic storyline and captures the high points rather well. Craig Horner may not be the ideal Richard Cypher (or Richard Rahl) of the novels appearance-wise, he does bring a certain presence to the character as well as bits of humor that I felt were missing from the Richard in the novels. Bridget Regan IS Kahlan Amnell... she is absolutely perfect in the role. Bruce Spence brings Zedd to life in a way none other could...     One reviewer wrote on here that he (or she - can't quite recall the name and I'm not going to go through all the reviews again to find it) said that he/she could not think of one person who liked both the novels and the show - well put your mind at rest because I'm one person who loves both. Another wrote that it was a good thing Terry Goodkind was not involved... ummm Terry Goodkind is very much involved in the show... that particular reviewer may want to get some facts straight.     The DVD set looks good - I am however eagerly awaiting the Blu-Ray version and seeing what goodies are on that before I purchase either one.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Luv this CD!  Best entertainer ever.  He will be hugely missed.  I miss him so much.
1576754227|4.0|Brian Tracy is one of my favorite authors on setting and working toward goals.  I've read numerous other authors who all add their own distinct niche to the subject, but when I want to be encouraged or refocused, I turn to Brian Tracy.  His \\"Goals\\" book is my favorite, but it is much longer than \\"Eat that Frog.\\"  The quick read of Eat that Frog is perfect reinforcement to stay focused on your main tasks.<br /><br />I give it a four stars instead of five because it left out one of the best pieces of advice Brian Tracy has ever offered:  review your goals daily by writing them daily.  This is such  an important concept.  To put another way:  That which gets your attention determines your direction which then determines your destination (Andy Stanley \\" The Principle of the Path).  The more we keep our goals in the forefront of our mind, the more our mind will focus our actions toward accomplishing those tasks.<br /><br />Again, this book is a quick read and the audiobook is less than three hours long.  You can read (or listen to) it in an afternoon or take it a chapter or two a day.  Solid, straightforward book.
6303142346|4.0|This title in Spanish was difficult to find. Even though this was a used library copy, it is perfectly adequate. The vendor sent it very quickly and the price was reasonable.    I had tried to find it in DVD, but found the price prohibitive.     As I'm giving my four year old grandson Spanish lessons, he loves to watch movies of stories he is familiar with already in English. I just sent this home with him, as we only watched the beginning at Nana's house.     Starting on a framework of known concepts and story line and then building a scaffold for concepts and vocabulary that need to be developed, the use of Spanish language Disney movies is a good tool.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This is a great movie,very dark and kind of sad. Good story line you don't know whether to be appalled or feel sorry for the main character...must see!
B002TSK3E4|2.0|apparently they wrote this album in the studio. yeah. next time, don't do that, guys. the material seems half-baked at best... reminds me of the level of writing on the first couple slayer albums. i'm surprised they released it.     this is nowhere near diabolus, reign in blood, south of heaven, god hates us all, etc. as far as quality. the mix lacks low end punch.     maybe this album will grow on me, but maybe i won't give it the chance to do so.     sorry slayer. you've given me years of enjoyment.
1881273873|2.0|This is an interesting concept about communication, although I'm not certain the quiz and resulting \\"understanding\\" of oneself couldn't have also been found in a good women's magazine. If you are actually in a relationship, and you are (gasp!) at all sexually involved, this leaves a big gap. Instead of any meaningful discussion of such a situation, you will read several pages of Christian rhetoric regarding the sin of premarital sex, not to mention the shocking health risks and supposedly overall unhealthy perception of sex - not just through religion, but through sociology, anthropology, and psychology. These last three are just mentioned, with no support, and the bottom line is that if you are single, you should absolutely not be having sex. Shame on you! Shame! If you are really out of touch with your own needs and seriously can't figure out how to be kind to someone else in a way that is meaningful, it's worth a scan. If you want preaching and sappy examples, this is the one for you.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|I liked the film...esp the soundtrack choices....a little oral sex never hurt anyone.....an enjoyable experience.
0307716988|3.0|I actually enjoyed reading this book.  I did read quite a few other books about MJ and his family and already knew about some of the stories he discussed.  His accounts of the 'abuse' his father layed down on the family was actually mild compared to what he has discussed in interviews.  So either he is 'sparing us the details' or it wasn't as extreme as he has implied in the past.  He only touches on his supposed relationship with Brooke Shields (I read in Taraborrelli's book that MJ 'liked' her but only hung out with her to 'help' her career).  But at the same time I can't stand her so maybe I overlooked something.  Other than that it was an interesting glimpse of MJ as a person.
0142410373|5.0|I purchased this book.<br /><br />Matilda is the classic story of an incredible smart little girl who develops telekinesis and uses it, not to improve her own horrible home life, but to help others. Don't know it? Perhaps you should.<br /><br />The differences between the book and movie versions are minute, but present. The movie is more Americanized and the story is smoother, but it lacks one of the books very strong points--a higher level of vocabulary.<br /><br />In Matilda Dahl (also the author of The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches and James and Giant Peach) presents his typical style, pitting a child against horrible adults who actively hate or seek to do the child harm. The title character lives in a home that not only doesn't appreciate her high level of intelligence, but ridicules it because her family is intimidated and scared by it. Matilda's family is emotionally abusive and neglectful, which some parents would seek to avoid, but I find an honest approach to life. Dahl's books don't treat children like they can't handle the darker side of things. Dahl doesn't ignore that there are some pretty crappy people out there, and sometimes they happen to have kids.<br /><br />Dahl, unlike a lot of authors, presents childhood as a battlefield. However not all children are perfect angels (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an example here), and not all adults are horrendous bullies. In Matilda her family may be part of the problem, but she finds an ally in her teacher, Miss Honey, who is a survivor of a bullied childhood.<br /><br />Through the book we learn not about revenge on bad people, or being nice despite being bullied and neglected, Dahl teaches kids to recognize and treasure the good parts of life, without letting the bad parts define themselves, or their experience.<br /><br />Also a smart part of this book is the accelerated vocabulary, which again, shows that Dahl distinctly decides not to treat children as incapable or juvenile. Because of the number of big words, all used in a context that makes them easy to understand, this book is best read as a collaborative effort between an adult and child, unless an child closer to teendom is the reader.<br /><br />I highly recommend Matilda on every level, especially because in the realm of fiction girls are often sentenced to be side kicks and creatures of first crushes, but Matilda is a strong, independent, intelligent girl who solves problems on her own. Matilda is the precursor to the more recent Coraline, with less a less scary and a more over the top spin.context that makes them easy to understand, this book is best read as a collaborative effort between an adult and child, unless an child closer to teendom is the reader.

006135323X|2.0|I was very frustrated with this book.  On the one hand, the author clearly synopsizes a great deal of substantive research on why we do the things that we do.  His discussions of the different cognitive biases are clearly explained and well supported by research (some his own).  As the title suggests, humans are not perfectly rational creatures but we do behave in consistent and generally predictable ways.  The material in this book can help us to understanding the why behind our thoughts.    The concept of behavioral economics is not as new or radical as the author implies (the Freakonomics books are another recent example) but this is an excellent overview of several decades worth of material.  And I must admit to being very impressed by the scope of the work.  Any chapter could have been expanded into a separate book.  Ariely covers a lot of ground while still providing enough substance to be useful and informative.    Even better, the writing style is very approachable.  It felt more like a conversation than a textbook.  I'd already read many of the original studies that he references.  This is by far the most readable version I've found.    My frustration seemed to come at the end of every chapter when the author leapt from a clear and research-based presentation of facts to an unsubstantiated conclusion.  For example, in one chapter he spent pages discussing the imperfections of the market and why they can not make perfect choices.  He makes a clear case that markets are really collections of people and may be unduly influenced by subtle human factors.  Then on the last page he concludes that government would therefore do it better.  His conclusion completely ignores the cognitive biases and unconscious influencers on the humans who make up the government.    In another example, he talks about sampling grapes at the grocery store in a discussion of honesty and the non-rationality of our thinking.  His example overlooks the inherent information imbalance between the seller and buyer.  Unlike homogeneous products like potatoes, grapes can be either very sweet or very sour.  Nor can the buyer use physical inspection as a proxy for ripeness.  Melons can be thumped and tomatoes checked for color but grapes are an enigma - they look and feel the same whether sweet or sour.  Rational buyers know they can redress the information imbalance with a small sample.  Without that assurance, they must discount the price they are willing to pay as a hedge against the chance that they'll get a sour batch.  Rational sellers know that by allowing the sample, they will command higher prices overall.  Rational sellers however also have to avoid setting a tone where shoplifting is perceived as acceptable.  The balance that a grape is acceptable but a lemon is not is a perfectly rational response to the information imbalance.  And buyers know this, too, even if they are unable to articulate it in front of the men with white coats and clipboards.  My (somewhat long-winded) point is that grapes at the grocery store fails as an example of \\"dishonesty\\".  The story is incomplete.    I said earlier that the book was so readable that it was like a conversation.  Let me qualify that it was a fairly stormy conversation.  I startled my wife several times with outbursts at the unsubstantiated conclusions and fuzzy thinking on the part of the author.  At one point I even threw the book across the room in frustration with the author.  On the other hand, I finished the book - and now that I think about it, I finished it at 2 or 3 in the morning despite needing to be up early the next morning for a meeting.  It certainly gets full points as thought-provoking and engaging reading.  The book will load you up with lots of entertaining tidbits for dinner party conversation but read it with a healthy dose of skepticism and make your own conclusions about how to apply the research.
0061914177|5.0|I sort of fell into blogging and now feel something like what Owen Wilson talks about in the movie \\"You, Me and Dupree\\".  I've been catching some slack for seemingly languishing, but I feel like the mother ship has finally sent me the message, \\"it's time\\".<br /><br />What I loved about this book is it helped me 1. renew my motivation that I am on the right track and give me just the dose of \\"if I can, you can\\" to know I will; 2. that I am better off being myself in order to be the most successful (as I always sort of expected); 3. gave me some good ideas to help me get more eyeballs on my blogs (if you've visited either of my main blogs, CaliforniVacation: SoCal Style or Bjork's BLEEP Blog, you know how I feel about no one seeing my blogs), and 4. he's the first one I know of who has been honest enough to put it out there that in the beginning you may just have to suck it up and considered yourself more or less chained to your Internet Source almost 24/7.  I would add to his awesome \\"crushing it\\" advice that in the beginning when you have less eyeballs on your blog is the best time to get everything into place so you don't have to do it later when those eyeballs are expecting at least four blogs a week.  In the beginning to not be so concerned if you aren't actually posting at least four blogs a week so you can give yourself at least one 24 hour period a week to step away from your Internet Source.  I love my topic.  I love being on line.  I love chocolate.  Sometimes too much of a good thing is exactly that \\"too much\\".

1416955070|4.0|City of Bones is the first of the mortal instruments series. I believe it's a trilogy but I'm not sure since I have not read the other 2 which are City of Ashes and City of Glass. This is the first book I have read by Cassandra Clare and I think writing style wise it was alright.<br /><br />The story revolves around Clarissa who witnesses a murder by three teenagers while at a club. Supposedly this is an all age club where she was hanging out with her bff Simon. After she sees the murder she doesn't know what to make of it or what to do about it. The body disappears and no-one can see the three of them except for her. So she keeps her mouth shut. Later it's explained to her by one of them that they were shadow hunters and the person they had killed was a downworlder. It's the job of shadow hunters to protect humans from demons and such.<br /><br />There is of course a big evil guy who is after one of the mortal instruments. Clary is naturally a significant player in all of what goes on. I think for the most part the story was good. It fit together pretty well although I did not find the names for things in this world very creative. Downworlders and such didn't seem like an interesting enough name.<br />For the most part the characters were well developed. Their personalities shine through even the annoying ones. I am glad that not all of them were made so they're nice to each other and watch what they say. The one character I think that might have lacked a bit in this book was her best friend Simon he sort of got randomly inserted around in certain situations.<br /><br />There were some action scenes which I think to me felt a bit like reading Harry potter. The thing I got confused the most by is that they used magic but said it wasn't magic and there was a big difference. It could be just me but I found it odd that they used what sounded like a wand but said it wasn't magic.<br /><br />As a warning this book is pretty long I think around seven hundred some pages but I think it's worth the read. It's easy to get through. I can't wait to start the next one.easy to get through. I can't wait to start the next one.

It's been a long time coming, but definitely worth the wait!

045122499X|5.0|This is the sequel to Pillars of the Earth.  It is about decendants of the Pillars characters, but it is set 200 years into the future.  Kingsbridge Catheadreal still stands, and the beginning is about making repairs to the roof, but then the story goes into The Black Plauge, and describes how the characters learn how to fight it and help others through tough times.  This is one of the best books that I have ever read.  It has five stars from me, that is for sure.
B002M2T1UO|3.0|I am a fan of The Shield and I am guessing that you are at least familiar with it or you wouldn't be looking at the box set.  Since you are here to decide to buy the box set or not, I want to warn you that they have created something that looks like a picture book which has the discs squeezed between the pages.  The problem is that every time you take a disc out or put it in, the disc is scraping across the surface of the cardboard pages in which it is sandwiched.  The book is nice looking so I did give it 3 stars for that reason and of course the series itself is as the other reviewers have mentioned well worth your time if you like the cop genre.  If this is the only DVD series you own, it would look nice on your coffee table, but if you have a DVD case it is awkward because of the shape and size of the box.  I suppose they create these cardboard box set holders to save money or to get you to buy the series in the boxes that you get with individual seasons.  I had the same problem with the complete series of the Wire.  I will probably have to take the DVD's out of the box set sleeves and put them in conventional plastic DVD cases to protect the DVD's which is an additional expense to consider if you are buying this set to save money.  It would be nice if the manufacturers offered alternative (conventional) packaging as an option without forcing you to buy the series one season at at time for double the price of the box set.
B002C6K7NA|1.0|That Skynard continues to produce music is one of the greatest disappointments of the Modern Age. They are tired, burned out and essentially irrelevant -- except to an audience that's essentially stuck in life. Their song \\"Still Unbroken\\" is a case in point: cliched guitar riffs that belong back in the 1980s mixed in with pseudo-\\"outlaw\\" lyrics attempting to convince us of the band's (non-existent) manliness and a guitar solo best suited for an afternoon nap. A better title -- for the song and for the band -- would be Still Broken. Thing is, though: this one ain't worth fixin'. Throw 'em on the trash heap with Styx, et. al.
B002OFWG7E|4.0|If you ask me, the Foo Fighters are long overdue for a hits album, in fact they should've put one out at least 3 years ago. They've been one of the most significant and consistant rock artists over the last 14 years. If you're a casual Foo Fighters fan, the odds are that this CD has most if not all the songs you're looking for. But to those who have payed closer attention to the band over the years will notice that some significant songs are missing, which is pretty much the case with any \\"greatest hits\\" album. In the liner notes, frontman Dave Grohl writes, \\"These 16 songs are what we're calling our 'Greatest Hits,' not to be confused with 'Our Best Songs' or 'Our Favorite Songs,' it is a collection of the songs that have defined our band's identity to most people over the years.\\" I think that's a pretty acurate statement, but even still, I would've fought for a few more songs to make this compilation. For example, where is \\"I'll Stick Around\\"? It was one of the band's first major hits, and it's even included on the DVD for the deluxe version of this package. \\"Stacked Actors\\" and \\"Next Year\\" also could've been included, they weren't huge hits but they were released as singles and the former has become a staple at their live shows. Also, \\"D.O.A.\\" and \\"Let It Die\\" are nowhere to be found, and these songs got tons of radio play. There's also a long list of less popular singles, but I didn't really expect them to make it on here. There's only so much room on a CD, but I think we could've cut out \\"Skin and Bones\\" since it wasn't really a hit, probably just a favorite of Grohl's. The acoustic version of \\"Everlong\\" wasn't entirely necessary, although it is cool to have since I'm a collector and I'm sure a lot of the female fans will dig it. Then there's 2 new songs; \\"Wheels\\" is a pretty strong track and it makes a great close to this chapter in the band's career, but \\"Word Forward\\" is kind of a throwaway song and was probably just left over from a previous album session.<br /><br />But I'm not here to complain, we still get 12 other classic songs from one of this decade's best rock bands! \\"Everlong\\", \\"My Hero\\", \\"Monkey Wrench\\", \\"Learn To Fly\\", \\"All My Life\\", \\"Times Like These\\", \\"Best of You\\", \\"The Pretender\\", \\"Long Road To Ruin\\", \\"Breakout\\"...It was also nice to see the first album represented with \\"This Is A Call\\" and \\"Big Me\\" since it seems to be overlooked in recent years. All the songs seem to have been remastered, they sound as loud and rich as ever!<br /><br />If you're a real Foo fan, I highly recommend the deluxe edition that comes with the DVD. For just a few dollars more you can have the band's music video collection. Who could forget hilarious videos like \\"Big Me\\" and \\"Learn To Fly\\" or the cool visuals in \\"Times Like These\\" and \\"Everlong\\"? I'm pretty sure every one of their music videos is here with the exception of \\"Breakout\\" and \\"The One.\\" These were probably left off because they aren't owned by the label due to their use of images from the films Orange County and Me, Myself & Irene.

B000IMUYJM|4.0|I know I will probably get blasted for giving this film only 4 stars,but it is not perfect as so many have claimed. The story starts out very promising and gives us a very eerie setting. The acting is above average, but there are numerous scenes of silly chatter that slow the film down. The film really gets going towards the end, but some plot holes kept me from being totally immersed in the horror. One in particular, how did Peter know Jess was in the basement?...and why did he break the window for that matter. I know why the director had this happen, but it makes no sense at all. That aside, the film does have a creepy quality and the ending is particularly chilling. I recorded this off of an HD channel, so I'm not sure how the DVD transfer is or anything about the new release. It is a well made chiller, but hardly the best horror film ever made in my eyes. I give it props for being an early film of this nature, but the script could have used a little tweaking.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|For those in the know about the original plans for this classic live release by The Rolling Stones, this set is long overdue. As a band of Brits with their roots deeply steeped in the delta blues The Stones emerging success allowed them to highlight some of their idols by way of picking their own opening acts, back at a time when this practice was unheard of.    On their 1969 North American tour they invited American blues legends BB King and Ike and Tina Turner to open for them.    The way that Get Your Ya Yas Out was originally invisioned by the band was as a double album, broken down thus; Record number one would contain BB King and Ike and Tina Turner's opening sets. Record number two would contain the album of The Stones set pretty much they way that it eventually was released.    While the band could pick their own opening acts they didn't yet have the clout to dictate exactly how their record releases would be presented. As such, GYYYO was released as a single disc with only The Stones own contributions represented.    Flash forward 40 years and we now have the disc as the band originally intended. Along with a third (second) disc of five outtakes from those recording sessions and you now have in your grubby little hands the complete concert experience from those long ago New York shows.    While I appreciate what some might say about short shifting folks with regards to the length of each CD, history will show that this is exactly what the worlds greatest rock and roll band originally intended, with five additional tracks thrown in for good measure.    Colour me impressed.    [...]

B0029LHW4U|4.0|DuVall gives a new lead vocal style to AIC and it rocks right in.  The E flat harmonies that are Jerry Cantrell's vision are carried out  and I am not disappointed.  Cantrell's \\"Degradation Trip\\" was an homage to Layne Staley and here again, there is a lot of reference to him.  It's a bold move to bring in a new lead with a voice that's probably stronger than Layne's; I'd be interested to know what the search was like.  Why 4 stars rather than 5?  I guess I'm not over Layne's death either.  I pull out the MTV Unplugged concert a few times a year and wonder what it had been like if he'd been able to beat his demons.  RIP, Layne Staley, AIC still lives.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a walker and have always watched my weight. Plus I practice yoga. So at 46 I thought I was in pretty good shape. But after Jillian got done with me, I was hurting! I  admit it was painful, but not overly so and I was able to push through it. A good workout. I love that it is only 20 minutes. The lead in time from the start of the video to the menu, I agree, is waaay too long. I really don't need to hear Jillian tell me, EVERY time I am ready to work out, that she is the number one trainer in America. (I believe you, Jillian. I bought your DVD.) Otherwise, a good buy.  And to the complaint that she doesn't mix it up enough...yes, be aware that it is the same workout over and over. But I pop on my iPod and listen to my own tunes or even an audiobook as I work out. The time passes quickly enough and I am comfortable with the moves.

I have watched it from the beginning and kept trying to find the similarities between the stars in the show to the stars in the book.  The book just didn't carry the excitement the show does.  The ending was not a cliffhanger, yet a \\"is it really over, what else is there\\".  Not a good ending even if there will be more that is coming.  Hopefully Ms. Conrad either gets help as an author or sticks to what she knows best, getting back to the show and playing her part as the lead.

006112429X|4.0|It's one of the uncomfortable little facts of life that sometimes we don't feel the things that we're \\"supposed\\" to feel. Everyone has been there at some point; at a wedding, a funeral, on an anniversary. For Eva Katchedorian, that moment comes on the day that her first child is born.      Deeply ambivalent about the idea of motherhood from the start, Eva hopes that with Kevin's birth she will finally experience real maternal feelings towards the child, feelings which were not present during the pregnancy itself. When this doesn't happen, Eva realizes she is in trouble. The infant Kevin only seems to reciprocate her mixed feelings, first refusing to nurse and later behaving strangely towards Eva in what she interprets as a deliberate effort to ruin her life. It's not a deliberate effort, of course. This is a baby, not some conniving madman. In all likely-hood the mother was probably sending very mixed signals to the child, but thus begins Eva and Kevin Khachaturian's strained and bizarre relationship.     The insinuation in \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is that evil men or boys can be the product of cold, unloving, unresponsive mothers. This is probably as good a theory as any. It's hard to quantify or document the type of \\"neglect\\" that Kevin experiences from Eva. It's a type of dysfunctional childhood that doesn't leave bruises or even a very compelling story to tell to a therapist. It's a type of dysfunction that our society seems to completely ignore. Though, clearly, the outcome was just as tragic as in any heinous case of child abuse. Could Shriver be right? Might Dylan Klebold or Kip Kinkel have come from backgrounds like this?    I enjoyed Shriver's eloquent prose but her dialogue is a little off at times. There are sequences of dialogue that will leave you just thinking \\"Huh?...\\" In one scene, Kevin and his friend are about 12 or 13 years old and have gotten in some minor trouble with the police. Kevin describes the officer who brought him home as having a\\"working man's smile, grinning ear to ear.\\" I don't know of any adolescents who talk like that. I can't think of anyone who talks that way, though the author is an American expatriate living in England so perhaps the English do use those expressions.     Give this unusual book a shot. It has a superb ending to offset the slow beginning and if nothing else, if you are a mother and genuinely love your children, it will probably make you feel a lot better about yourself as a parent when compared to this book's protagonist.

B002C39TU0|1.0|I bought this album from a record store, sealed.   Open it up, and there's little white specks practically glued to the record on both sides.     After cleaning it up, the first cut, The Queen Is Dead, had several pops (popping at the same place every rotation), then a skip!    The rest of the side played fine, but when I flipped over to side two, there's a series of pops on Marr's acoustic intro to Bigmouth Strikes Again.       I've never had problems with any of the Rhino LP reissues, but apparently I got a bunk record, and to top it off, the store wouldn't exchange it or refund my money.    I think I'll hold off on buying the rest of The Smiths vinyl reissues, thanks to getting burned on this one.
0786852550|4.0|Well, on the one hand, I loved this book.  On the other...it was pretty dark.  I have a hard time reading books where I can count on all the characters to treat one another badly, time after time.  I know that a lot of books are full of people who are more principled and generous than almost anyone is in reality.  The Amulet of Samarkand is the exact opposite of that: everyone is always selfish, amoral, opportunistic, nasty.  No good deed goes unpunished.  Anyone who won't threaten you to your face is just waiting to stab you in the back.<br /><br />But it was so well done.  The main character, Nathaniel, is particularly interesting.  You can't help but feel for the poor kid - given away as a child by a family who apparently didn't much regret his loss, he's placed as an apprentice with a master who'd rather not have a child in the house.  The master, Arthur Underwood, is petty and small minded.  He is a mediocre magician, but an excellent bureaucrat.  That is to say: he is sycophantic to those more powerful than him, and he is tyrannical to those less powerful than him.  Poor Nathaniel sits at the bottom of the totem pole and so he is Arthur Underwood's favorite whipping boy.  Nathaniel is smart, diligent, desperate for affection - and it's hard to see his talent unrewarded, his thirsty heart dry.<br /><br />In some books young children deprived of affection, family, friends, and playtime grow up to have a heart of gold and keen sympathy for others who suffer.  I have to admit that Nathaniel is the more realistic character - he's angry, greedy, and untrusting.  As much as he hates his master, he mimics Underwood's bad attitude, treating commoners (non-magicians) with contempt and cultivating a sense of extreme self-importance.  Sometimes I liked Nathaniel, sometimes I hated him.  He's not a good kid, to be perfectly honest - but he's better than he could be, and I learned to admire him for it.<br /><br />While magic rules this world, humans do not really possess it.  Rather, they summon and enslave demons who wield magical power.  The book is narrated both by Nathaniel and by the djinni he commands, Bartimaeus.  Bartimaeus is fantastic, a constant delight in a very grim book.  He's funny, full of quips and cynical insight, a real showman, worldly and knowledgeable.  As many reviewers have mentioned, his footnotes are a delight to read.  The second one in the book, added to a scene where Bartimaeus is contemplating Nathaniel during a summons, reads, \\"I couldn't do anything while I was in the circle, of course.  But later I'd be able to find out who he was, look for weaknesses of character, things in his past I could exploit.  They've all got them.  You've all got them, I should say.\\"<br /><br />It would be easy to get bogged down in how horrible it is that all the demons in the book are the unwilling slaves of unworthy magicians.  The only thing I can say in the magicians' favor is that the demons aren't any nicer to one another than the humans are to them.  Organized into a strict hierarchy, a djinni like Bartimaeus is always ready to put a less-powerful imp in its place, and eager to avoid a higher-ranking afrit who will casually and painfully exert his dominance over Bartimaeus.  Comforting, right?<br /><br />The plot is full of crazy twists and turns.  The mystery isn't who the villain is (this is clear from the beginning) but how twelve-year-old Nathaniel is going to win the day against such a devious and powerful magician.

The mystery isn't who the villain is (this is clear from the beginning) but how twelve-year-old Nathaniel is going to win the day against such a devious and powerful magician.  Even Bartimaeus, clever and cocky as he is, isn't sure it can be done.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I went to see the movie this past Friday afternoon. Within the first song that MJ sung I got sad as well as upset. Upset from the media who completley bashed him and saying he was unable to perform. If he were alive today I would pay top dollar to have gone to that concert if I could afford it.  MJ was AMAZING with the dancing and his singing. Everyone was. He was alive on the stage and showed what a serious performer he was. He showed how important it was to execute his craft.  It was nice to see a fun side of him as well as his smile.<br /><br />I appreciate being able to see this video footage.  I am so happy the fans have come out to show support of MJ and to see this film. When the movie was done the audience applauded when the credits came on. As a fan it had been a dream of mine to see MJ perform.  For me it has always been about the music and dancing.  I had hoped that the \\"This is it\\" tour would have come to the US and that MJ would have changed his mind to come back here.<br /><br />If this is the way I need to see him then I have only happy memories of one of the greatest entertainers of all time.
0385504225|2.0|I was more than a little disappointed in this book. Based upon his prior works I expected at the least an interesting story that moved along at a good clip. Such was not the case. It seemed that half the book was taken up with other people explaining to Dr. Langdon what he didn't understand. It took forever to get through the last 25 or 30 pages. It will either be the shortest movie made next year, or the most boring.
B00168OIOE|5.0|IMHO the two best Disney pictures of the past decade plus are Monsters Inc. and The Incredibles.  (ok, Toy Story may come close, but it's primarily a boy's movie)<br /><br />Monsters Inc. is VERY appropriate for boys or girls; and family viewing.  I guarantee that both young and old will enjoy the story - and young children will not be frightened by these monsters.  The heart of the movie is the relationship that develops between Sully (big blue fur ball) and Boo - the child that manages to enter the monster world.  Children enjoy the fact that mosters are as afraid of children as human children often are of monsters.  It's a real ground leveler.  Though there are 'good' and 'bad' monsters in the show, good triumphs and it leaves everyone feeling happy in the end.<br /><br />Disney sells a wonderful 26\\" stuffed Sully for about $30.  If you want to make those little eyes light up this Christmas, consider a present including both the movie and the stuffed animal.  It's guaranteed to make the most timid child unafraid of bedtime.
B002E2M5J6|5.0|I love the way Jamiroquai puts their funky remix on some of their songs when performed live.  The DVD is absolutely beautiful.  This concert DVD is truly one of the best DIRECTED DVD's out there.  And it looks GORGEOUS in blu ray.  I'm blasting it right now, my neighbors are going to be so upset.  I can't help it..it sounds just that great.
0954510364|5.0|R. Ingpen is a wonderful illustrator, whose images are a tribute to an amazing story.  The entire production, from illustrations, to paper, to font create a reading experience that is a credit to the work of R. L. Stevenson. This is a book that I have enjoyed reading and giving as a gift.
0743298039|4.0|I enjoyed this book once I read the first couple of chapters; it was a bit slow to start. I was captivated by the mystery of Vida Winter's and Margaret Lea's tales. I was somewhat horrified regarding the incest and sadomasochism used in the story. The descriptiveness of Charlie's room left my stomach about to heave, but I enjoyed the twists and turns and I found myself thinking about the book when I wasn't able to be reading it.
0385732554|5.0|Lois Lowry has created a terrifyingly regimented future in which every need is provided for.  There is no hunger (a child is severely reprimanded for saying he is 'starving'), everyone is exquisitely polite, there is no color, no music, no love, no pain and no choice.  Careers are assigned at the age of twelve, and if one's usefulness to the community is at an end, or a child is unable to conform to the community's expectations, he or she is 'released.'<br /><br />When Jonas turns twelve, he is chosen to be The Receiver and is apprenticed to The Giver, the repository for memory.  This is both a tremendous honor and burden, as The Receiver must experience every memory of the human race as passed on by The Giver.  As The Giver passes memories to him, Jonas begins to see colors, experience pain, and understand the terrible price the community pays for the Sameness it has elected.<br /><br />What Jonas and The Giver choose to do with this understanding makes for a thought provoking tale, and the ambiguous ending provides excellent fuel for discussion.  Dystopia is not a new subject for fiction, and this book has overtones of The Twilight Zone, The Prisoner, Logan's Run, Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451, but with a YA slant.  Excellently written, the truth about Jonas' world is gradually revealed and the reader is lulled into its rituals and celebrations before being slammed with the nasty truth about its ultimate nature.<br /><br />This was November's book club selection and while I was a little dubious at being asked to read a children's book, this was one of the better books on the list.  I'm looking forward to reading the other two books in this series.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I've have been fortunate enough to see Joe 6 times. What a great way to  spend an evening. He's all about the music.Amazing talent!!!!  Hope he comes back to the Akron,Ohio area soon and often.  I've been folling his music since before Bloodline. Saw him on an A&E  documentary, and then i was hooked.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|This album reminds me sooo much of Queen.  There's lots of slower piano ballads, there's a sort of cohesive magnitude, grandiose to a fault, it's overproduced, and there's strong vocals.      All that aside, it's an okay album, not exactly what I expected.  It's not that hard-rocking, is my main complaint.  But maybe it will grow on me.
B001DHXT34|5.0|I have been looking for the movie at all the stores for the last 3 years they have all ways been sold out or not going to have it at all. I should of just came here to get it. It would of save me a lot of gas and headaches of looking for it. Buffy
B002KDUDG6|1.0|Boring is what Michael Buble's new album \\"Crazy Love\\" is.  He has chosen tired old songs that might have been good in their day but have no staying power.  His best album is \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" where he soulfully sings \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\" and very heatedly purrs \\"I'm Your Man\\" and rocks with \\"Comin' Home Baby\\" and swings with \\"I've Got the World on a String\\" and hits it with \\"That's Life\\".  The new album just doesn't have it - in my opinion.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am kind of glad I learned about this show late because I was able to watch all the episodes back to back.  The only problem now is that Season 2 just ended and now I have to wait all year for Season 3!!!  It is wonderfully dark and seductive and additive!!!  I am a huge vampire fan to begin with, but my husband is not, and he got just as hooked as I did.  After about the 3rd episode, we couldn't wait to watch another.  It is David Lynch meets Anne Rice.... truly amazing!!!!
0060254920|5.0|\\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" definately takes me back to my childhood, where my dad would often read this book to me. I consider this a great children's book that can be shared amongst an entire family for years. This book encourages imagination in young minds and also has wonderful illustrations. I fondly remember reading this book over and over again, and I would encourage children to read it now. I would rate this as one of the top ten children's books out there.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|This was certainly better than the cartoon version Beowulf. It was fresh and fun. Full of adventure and action. My biggest problem was when Canaan said we need stronger metal. Well viking age technology used carbon steel in their weapons. A piece of metal was recovered from Canaan's ship. To be stronger or harder than carbon steel the piece of the ship would have to be Titanium or Beryllium. Both of which have a forging temperature well beyond what a charcoal air driven forge can produce. I guess it could be some kind of space metal not yet discovered. Well, still a great movie.
0395389496|5.0|First of all, the illustrations in this book are simply fantastic. I remember, as a child, being enamored with the wonderful pages filled with pitctures of the train, the children, the christmas scenery, and, in particular, the illustration of the wolves. Secondly, this is a fantastic christmas story suited for not only children, but adults. A true Christmas Classic, this story has never become tiresome, and I loved it as a kid and fondly remember reading this with my family when I was young. This is a great story that can be shared with your entire family.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I check out 'different' seasonal albums because I get sick of traditional songs. Fully aware this isn't supposed to be a Christmas album (and fine with melancholy Christmas music anyway) I pushed 'play' and got one dirge-ish song after another. Some are in Celtic (I assume) but even those I think are supposed to be in English are really hard to understand. He sounds like he has his throat sewn shut and is trying to 'sing' that way--does he think it sounds dramatic? Um, not. Sorry, I don't get it. He's done some great stuff but this isn't it.
0061703257|4.0|For a smart reader Shutter Island's twist won't be a suprise. It'll send a memo a hundred pages in and be waiting for you to finish with a beverage of choice when you finish the last page. In truth I'm not a big fan of \\"twists\\". Its more of a gimmick and truthfully I like Bloch's Psycho over Shyamalan's Sixth Sense for usage. But truthfully as far as novels go there was something about the ending that in my opinion made the book better with the ending. In truth I was hooked by the story from the get go. There is a odd little begining but the story itself is very atmospheric in its way with two federal marshals going to an island prison as a hurricane bears down upon the island. What procedes it are little clues to something bigger than a missing person, hints at torture, and other nefarious deeds being perpetrated by the staff of the hospital.<br />But of course with the twist things change. Unlike other entertainments to use a twist though I did like what the twist reveals about the character it happens to and his sad tragic little tale. Here you have an ending in my view that works but its the character details that interested me about the book and in the end the character triumphed over the cliches. Its a good book in my opinion. Not as good as other Lehane novels but I can see why its on the short list of works to be adapted, by no less than Martin Scorsese.

B00275EGX8|4.0|I've been a Kathryn Bigelow since Strange Days. I'll admit in a career thats included Point Break and Near Dark, thats not a real good statement, but truthfully thats the first film of hers I saw as a young adult and one that made an impression on me. Now years later and having seen films of hers like the aforementioned ones I can be impressed with this impressive director breaking a mold in the action film market and making some of the best guy movies ever. I had been waiting for The Hurt Locker since hearing about it a couple of years ago. I'll admit I don't watch too many movies on the Iraq war, but with Bigelow in the directors seat and a story that wasn't aiming for a political angle I perked up. I didn't see many movies in theatres this year, but seeing something like this in theatres missing out on Transformers or Wolverine didn't matter that much.  As it is The Hurt Locker is a rather simple story focusing on an EOD's tour that is quickly coming to an end. The first nine minutes sets up what the movie will be with a tense scene where a simple job goes awry when a man steps out of a door holding what might be cell phone. Its an incredibly tense little scene thats topped easily by others.  But more than the scenes the movie is brilliantly about character, two in particular. The first is the main one, William James, a loose cannon maverick who puts himself in harms way knowingly, taking chances and generally putting the other two members of his team in a flux. JT Sanborn is more of a straight arrow who does things by the book because He wants to survive his tour doing his job the way He was trained to. And Owen Eldridge is the younger member of the team quietly suffering from the deaths He's witnessed and seeking therapy from Col. Cambridge.   Thats a basic rundown of the story, three characters surviving a bevy of engagements and the way they interact with each other. While Eldridge is a good character the real meat of the story comes between the conflict between Sanborn and James escalating in a final scenes where both Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie really excelled in my opinion. Better though was a final scene following James at a banal home life, cleaning out his storm drains and grocery shopping with his wife. Theres a small bit of dialogue with Jeremy Renner speaking to infant son that put the movie in some of the same territory as Bigelow's Point Break, only on a more dramatic footing. For this small scene alone I would be suprised if Renner doesn't recieve a large ammount of nominations. Bigelow as well deserves a lot of credit in trying to ground the movie in some sort of reality, building most of the action around suspense instead of simple action- check out the sniper scene, the only gunfight of the movie as the team bonds trading shots with gunmen.   Truthfully the movie is far from perfect with a few scenes that did stretch credibility. I'll admit I'm not a soldier so I won't argue the truth with a few scenes. Then again the film is still a movie and a few scenes are a minor quibble on what is otherwise a great film, well worth your time.  I should add this since I did eventually pick up the Blu-Ray. Sadly the features are the same as the DVD from a good commentary to a very small making of. Picture wise I found the DVD a bit brighter but the Blu Ray does have an incredibly detailed image. While it was darker I would describe it as being more realistic in color and sharpness. I'm not very good about judgement on these things but while it might not astound the picture and audio quality is very well produced.
0307236722|5.0|This was my first purchase through Amazon.com.  I was very impressed with the speed and quality of the product that I ordered and received.  I would definately order again through here and the vendor supplying the product - Book-A-Lot.
B000BNX3AU|5.0|I never watch this movie in the theatres.  I borrowed the DVD of this movie from my best friend who said that I would like it.  She was wrong because I truly love, love this movie.  I like all the actors in this movie and the dogs.  Diana Lane does a superb job as a recent divorcee who is being encourage by her family to not give up and to start dating again.  I even liked the butcher at the local grocery store.  It is after this that I decided to buy it for my own movie collection.  Now I can watch it anytime I want.  It is a sweet, funny movie that makes you feel good.
0061730327|4.0|As many reviewers have pointed out, this book tells the amazing story of William Kamkwamba.  Though ostensibly about his improbable  building of a windmill that brings electricity, it is about much more. The majority of the book focuses on William's life in Malawi and the drought and famine that devastates the people and the region.  The book provides the reader with a first-hand account of life in Malawi.  The book opens with things going fairly well for William, his family, and friends.  His life of course is vastly different than our western lives, but he is content.  Then, the drought and famine strike and things begin to fall apart for William and the people around him.  As things grow worse in William's family, he is no longer able to go to school, which devastates William who values education above all else.  Determined to keep up with the kids in school, he goes to a small library and begins studying.  While there he discovers a book on physics that will change his life.  It is this book that leads to the amazing windmill that gets him invited to TED and made him a worldwide sensation as an example of hope and opportunity to millions.    While the book title and all the press around it focuses on the windmill and the results, that portion of the story really only comes to light in the last third to quarter of the book.  The vast majority focuses on his life and the conditions of Malawi that lead to the development of the windmill.  While I found these portions fascinating, I did keep wondering when we were going to get to the windmill of the title and the story that was mentioned on the back of the book.  Further, I would have liked a lot more detail about William's life and experiences after the windmill began to stir up international interest.  So, I guess my only real criticism is that the story seemed to start with an amazing amount of fascinating detail, which seemed to fade away once we got to the portion of the story (and beyond) that inspired the book in the first place.  I did read an advance copy of the book and hope that some of these issues were addressed in the final edit.  However, even if they were not, I will say these are minor concerns and this is an inspirational story that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an informative and uplifting read.
B00005QGAV|5.0|On this one CD you get your pop, rock, soul!  You really understand why Michael is the King of Pop and much more!  I knew most of the well known songs; Thriller, Billie Jean, Beat It, e.t.c, but there was so much more that I am just discovering!  I had never heard some of the songs on this CD or I might of heard them once on a radio station somewhere but not have known that they were MJ's.   For instance, \\"Give In To Me\\" - MJ doing hard rock. The companion DCD to this CD is a must have!  I am just blown away by all the \\"new\\" material I am discovering!  I think I now have practically all MJ's songs.    GOD BLESS THE KING!!!
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Love this cd, Huey rocks! The only gripe I have is that the very end of the song Cruisin is cut off, it is cut off too early.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This movie is a monument to two things: one of the greatest entertainers in the music world, and what would have been one of the greatest concerts of all time.  Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson died before his dream \\"final curtain call\\" tour could become a reality.  But the concert director Kenny Ortega has pieced together 2 hours worth (from over 100 hours of rehearsal footage) of song, dance, interviews, and on-stage video from the concert.  The result is absolutely stunning.  In this movie you have two hours of pure entertainment.   You will want to sing and dance along with Jackson and his crew as they rehearse for an awe-inspiring curtain.  And how awe-inspiring it is!  Some of the highlights: Jackson cut into scenes from GILDA and other film noir classics leading into the toe-tapping SMOOTH CRIMINAL.  An on-stage \\"toaster\\" that pops dancers out from under floor boards.  A \\"cherry-picker\\" that lifts MJ out over the audience during the rockin' BEAT IT.  What about a new, goulish THRILLER?  All of these songs are familiar and appealing.  We love hearing them, and watching MJ rehearse them is a delight.  There are old favorites (all of the afore mentioned pieces) and some new ones I hadn't heard before (I JUST CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU, and a gut-wrenching EARTH SONG).  You want to get up and dance with him and his amazing crew.  However, in the back of your mind, you know that it was never to be.  MJ met his tragic end before he could see his dream concert through to reality.  In the rehearsal footage, he looks so healthy and energetic.  It's hard to look at him up on the stage, so intoxicated with the infectious music, with the knowledge that, in two months time, he will be dead.  The world will always mourn the loss of a talented star.  However, we will always have THIS IS IT, his labor of love.  Whatever demons haunted MJ behind the curtain, on-stage he was and always will be The King of Pop.  THIS IS IT shows us that.  It is outstanding.
B001HN697M|5.0|If you've already watched the other Underworld movies, watching this one will make you want to go back and rewatch the other two.  This is a touching history that brings heart into the others.  Having the back story really helps tie everything together, and creates a fullness to the entire storyline.  I felt like Rise of the Lycans is the one file that created my current enthusiams for the complete series.
B002N1AERI|5.0|Should you be concerned about Epica fifth full-length album and the unrestrained glee with which the band throws everything in the mix, then the kitchen sink, a sample of George H.W. Bush, quantum physics, the Mayan calendar and the Tibetan Book of the Dead for good measure ?<br /><br />Oddly, No. Design Your Universe could have become a monument of kitsch but the dutch symphonic metal band makes it work. It is richer than its predecessor, [[ASIN:B000TGQDZQ Divine Conspiracy]] (TDC), even though it does not have as serene and accomplished a showcase as Chasing the Dragon ; the two longest tracks, Kingdom of Heaven and the title track, are majestic but less approachable.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the genre, Symphonic Metal is a melodic form of metal, often female-fronted, that at times flirts with progressive rock and is an improbable melting pot of proto-metal like Mot&ouml;rhead, showtunemeisters like Andrew Lloyd Weber, past academic music pioneers like Carl Orff and epic film score writers like Hans Zimmer. Epica is front and center of the second generation of bands embracing the genre.<br /><br />Epica has a new line-up with  Ariën Van Weesenbeek now a full-time member on drums and Isaac Delahaye taking over lead guitar. Both come from the death metal band God Dethroned and their presence ensures that Epica, instead of drifting slowly away from the Beauty and the Beast template of the genre like Within Temptation did long ago, stands its ground... Therefore, instead of veering towards a mostly soprano-fronted sound like Tarja's Nightwish while keeping a few grunts for the scenery,  Epica embraces the contrast with some excellent results, in particular on the title track, Martyr of the Free World or Deconstruct.<br /><br />That said, Epica is more than ever Simone Simons' stage. Her voice does not seem to have suffered from her medical problems and she is at ease with pop or operatic vocals. Being a mezzo-soprano, her voice is particularly rich in themid-range. Of course, singing for a symphonic metal band where bombast is the blood of life, she is often used in a higher range where her timbre shines less, to deliver the soaring anthems that are the guilty pleasure of the genre. And that she does magnificently on many tunes, the most impressive being Tides of Time which could have been syrupy but is instead a great metal lied, perhaps better than Living a Lie or Safeguard to Paradise on TDC.<br /><br />Since DYU is an Epica album, the song roster cannot be simple. There is of course a quasi-mainstream song, the early released and first video Unleashed which is remarkably catchy, in the same commercial vein as Never Enough from TDC. But songs on an Epica album are often part of something more complex. Not only can they act as prologue (Indigo or The Final Embrace on TDC, Samadhi and the Price of Freedom here) but they also belong to song cycles that span several records. The first one, The Embrace that Smothers, dealing with organized religion, was a collection of nine songs started when Mark Jansen was still with After Forever, and came to a close with TDC.<br /><br />The second, A New Age Dawns, deals with the collapse of the Mayan culture and possibly with the new, fashionable Y2-12 bug (the end of calendar times...). This cycle was started in 2005 on [[ASIN:B000B5XSTO Consign to Oblivion]] and DYU adds three songs to the ongoing catalog: Resign to Surrender, Kingdom of Heaven and Design your Universe. They add to the canon and fuse with the overall vibe of DYU: not only that our passivity will be our downfall but also that it is not too late, that we can will ourselves to change the tide, design our universe if you will.<br /><br />This of course makes Epica's work a little complex to follow. The effort as a whole, particularly seen album to album, is titillatingly ambitious, like an Ayreon continuing saga or Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy's chronicling of his recovery.<br /><br />All this makes Design Your Universe a spectacular, no compromise Symphonic Metal album and probably one of the best albums of the year in any genre. It is particularly welcome since the ranks of Symphonic Metal are temporarily thinned. After Forever, perhaps the most underrated of all the founding groups of the genre, is disbanded and Floor Jansen is still at work putting a new band (ReVamp) together. Within Temptation has a light schedule due to baby duties. Nightwish will show in 2010 whether they can follow their brilliant Dark Passion Play or follow the less impressive Made in Hong-Kong. Krypteria and Lacuna Coil have both produced in 2009 good but very mainstream poppy albums and others like Tristania or Xandria have to adapt to a new singer.<br /><br />Which leaves Epica at the top of their game with their best album yet.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Whether you're in to vampire movies or not, you'll get drawn in to this series.  It is an imaginative, original story line with some good spins and a nice sprinkle of romance, humor, and a little thrill.   The good thing is, you won't spend too much time in front of the tube, because Season Two starts to drag on and wraps it up nice enough that you'll be glad it's over.  I have friends that have read the complete book series, and they are still waiting on Season 3, but for the rest of us that have not read the books, we're not looking forward to any more episodes.
B002MRROKS|5.0|I've been waiting for this concert to see the light of day for a long time and it does not disappoint one bit. In fact, the overall quality of the video and audio are stellar, better than I'd hoped for! It's a great set list and the energy never dips. It's cool to hear early versions of songs from \\"In Utero\\" too. I didn't realize they played any of those songs at this show.     Classic!
1565117808|3.0|This is a book which has the potential to be great -- except it is fraught with gore.  It is a fascinating story about a young boy/man (Pi) who is searching for God, for truth, for comfort, for acceptance.  He and his family begin a journey from India to Canada.  Pi's father owned a zoo, so when the family readied to take this long trip, the animals boarded the ship as well.  Pi survives the ocean for 227 days, with many \\"mini adventures\\".  Yann Martel is an excellent writer whose look at religion from many vantage points, knowledge of animal behavior, and study of human behavior is interesting, and sometimes entertaining.  Although extremely well-written, the needless massacre of animals, with clear details (with no apparent reason), takes the fascination away for me.
B0009X766Y|5.0|I'd never seen this movie and it is one of my wife's all-time favorites.  She refers to it often.  Finally got this DVD and now I see why.  What a great movie!!!  This is truly one of the all-time classics and a must-see movie for generations to come.
0743290127|4.0|Chasing Harry Winston is the story of three women from New York and their lives as they approach thirty.  There is Adriana, exotic and beautiful from Brazil who uses men to get what she wants but is starting to worry about losing her looks; Emmy, just out of a long term relationship; and Leigh, in a serious relationship but having doubts.    This book is like gossiping with your girlfriends over martinis....except more glamourous than in real life, as they are attractive, wealthy, and have great jobs that enable them to travel to exotic places.    That endless glamour and celeb name dropping is slightly irritating at times, especially in regards to Adriana, but overall it's great escapism into an exciting world.

0756655730|5.0|Just received this book, and it's clear the other reviewers are exactly right. It's a huge, heavy, very high quality scientific reference book. The subtitle is 'Definitive Visual History of Life on Earth' and it may just be. There's probably more than 2,000 pictures, painting and maps in this book and on a quick scan they all look first rate. Every page oozes quality.        You can't go wrong at this very low price, a big discount from the surprisingly low cover price of $40. Editorially the book looks to be the work of designers in Great Britian and India with the book printed and bound in Singapore.
0545123267|5.0|Shiver is hard to put down. I wanted it to go on forever. At the same time I wanted to know how it would end.    I'd been reading Shiver for a couple of days and enjoying it when a few reality spoilers popped up for me. Like, if the cold is what makes them turn into wolves, why not migrate south? If Grace's parents are so neglectful, why is she such a disciplined child, doing her homework, preparing supper, etc.? At 17, Grace and her friends have just become interested in boys and boyfriends?!  The author answered the first two questions suitably while I answered the third on my own. Grace and her friends are introverts as I was in high school. Then I remembered I didn't have a boyfriend until I was 17 either!    Pros: Shiver has likeable characters, a well-paced plot, and very romantic. It had its funny moments and its sad moments. I would have LOVED this book as a teen.    Cons: Shiver ends with an abrupt ending like the ones you see in some movies. But what is great for movies only raises more questions here. A few other strings are left untied, but nothing so major that this work cannot be read alone.    I decided to overlook the abrupt ending and a few unanswered questions and give 5 stars. I enjoyed the novel that much. Really, I truly have no interest in getting involved in a romantic series of novels about the same couple over and over.

0470477237|5.0|I remember when I got my first email account.  I only checked it when somebody called and told me they emailed me.  Then I started dialing up and checking about once a week.  Before long, I was checking once a day.  Today, I have email on my phone 27/7.  Faxes and voice mail have dropped almost completely.  Qualman makes the convincing case that social media will follow the same saturation path with even greater need and benefit.  I believe it.  I can see how social media will grow and not only overtake email, but also potentially replace search as we know it.  As a heavy email user (right now), this was the biggest revelation for me in the book.<br /><br />The book starts off with an example of how a 10 minute wait in a line at the store can turn into productive time with social media.  This got my attention and kept me engaged for the rest of the book.  I agree with many of the premises in the book, but I had difficulty believing that everyone will be outgoing enough to post everything they do on their personal pages.  However, as the author points out, even if everyone does not do this, there will be enough people doing it that there will be enough content created to make the application invaluable.  He is right in his assertion when he says people trust their friends' recommendations before they trust Google's.<br /><br />The author started mixing the concept of social media with that of the internet in general in chapter 4.  While I believe social media may have had an influence on the 2008 presidential election, I believe there were far greater forces at work in the outcome of the election.  Social media undoubtedly helped Obama, but perhaps it did not play as crucial a role as the author would have the reader believe.  The author's numbers could represent the results of voter sentiment, not the cause.<br /><br />I liked the way the book is laid out.  I specifically like the full sentences in the table of contents.  I like the chapter reviews, although sometimes they are not in the same order as the information in the chapter.<br /><br />The insights on marketing, on referrals, on sources of labor in the future, elimination of the middlemen, and his observation that history keeps repeating itself are all fantastic.<br /><br />I loved this book and it has changed my views dramatically on this subject.

B000UNYJXQ|2.0|I watched this film the other night on a premium movie channel. I think it plays with facts rather loosely and selectively. Yes, insurance companies often deny claims. I used to be an insurance administrator for a company I worked for and often I was appalled at refusals to pay; however, I personally know that submitting a grievance claim with a doctor's note often gets the insurance to pay. The part of the film that rankled me was Moore's attempts to claim that socialized medicine in countries like Canada and the U.K. work well. Nothing could be further from the truth. They do ration care, especially with folks older than 50 or 60. I know this from personally knowing a former boss of mine, who was a British citizen; he came to work in the U.S. so he could get his wife treated for uterine cancer. She was about 50 and had been diagnosed about 7 months and was still on a waiting list for treatment. When he found a job in the U.S. and brought his wife over, she was in treatment in just a few days. This country is in for a rude awakening if the healthcare bill passes because our citizens will go through the same nonsense as my former boss and his wife. And finally, I found the part about Moore taking people to Cuba for treatment to be such a lie ... is he so naive to really think that the general population of Cuba are treated in such a nice facility? No, those nice facilites for only for the favored few, such as the political elite of Cuba. There has been a lot of research into this since his film came out; do a 'Net search to get the facts about his grandstanding Cuba trip. This film was shameless propaganda for someone who thinks government is the answer to everything, when often it is government that is the problem.

B002HFP0QU|4.0|It has been 50 years since The Bee Gees came alive, and have been introduced to the spotlights of fans of all kinds, all over the world. While the Gibb brothers have had their shares of highs and lows, the songs that have been conjured, have honestly been one of the biggest constants as singer/songwriters of all time. While it is so sad that The Bee Gees aren't performing anymore, since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Maurice Gibb back in 2003. Nevertheless, with the way the music industry has been going lately, it has been very easy to deeply forget all the great and down to Earth guilty pleasures that Robin, Andy and Maurice have made for so many generations that have been dancing with joy. Now to celebrate the trio's 50th Anniversary, a new collection has been made to showcase The Bee Gees in the best, but it isn't completely all of the best.<br /><br />The Ultimate Bee Gees, replaces the well-documented and received 2001 double-album hits package The Bee Gees Their Greatest Hits: The Record, as a new entry of what has made The Bee Gees talented as songwriters. The songs have all been remastered and neatly packaged as a mostly strong reflection of what has made The Bee Gees so strong in strength as singers from their best anthems in the 70's like Jive Talkin, How Deep Is Your Love, Stayin' Alive and You Should be Dancing from Saturday Night Fever, to their most intimate ballad they've made for themselves like Too Much Heaven and How Can You Mend A Broken Heart. It also includes some of their most overlooked and dedicated songs like One, Alone, Still Waters Run Deep, and their last big hit, This Is Where I Came In. The collection also includes some songs that've never been on a Bee Gees compilation including live material of songs that they wrote for other acts like Heartbreaker for Dionne Warwick and Guilty which Barry recorded with Barbara Streisand back in 1980. While the collection is a deep and strong double-album, there are a few tracks that have been surpringly overshadowed from their past collections including Throwing Our Love Away, which The Gibb brothers recorded with their departed brother Andy (whom sadly died in the late 80's,) and Immortality which they did a brilliant recording of, which they later gave to Celine Dion.<br /><br />Overall, despite a couple of flaws, The Ultimate Bee Gees still remains a very strong and detail reflection of what had made The Bee Gees one of the strongest singer/songwriting groups of all time. It is a great reminder of how strong their song have remained throughout the testiments of time, and how deep their songs are enjoyable to listen to. While there are too many of the wannabe artists out there right now like Rihanna and The Jonas Brothers who seem to have taken over the mainstream to this generation of music lovers, they'll never have the deep impact that The Bee Gees have still carried with their greatest songs. If you've never owned a Bee Gees album before, or heard any of their songs, than this would be a great buy for your music collection.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+ly overshadowed from their past collections including Throwing Our Love Away, which The Gibb brothers recorded with their departed brother Andy (whom sadly died in the late 80's,) and Immortality which they did a brilliant recording of, which they later gave to Celine Dion.

B002MRROKI|5.0|In a word - amazing! Live At Reading serves as a vibrant reminder as to why Nirvana belongs in the pantheon of great rock bands, and how they may likely be the last great and meaningful band to emerge in the past twenty years. Live At Reading captures the band at a crossroads - just a year before in 1991, the band played the very same festival, but was relegated to an afternoon performance somewhere in the middle of the multi-day, multi-band gathering. Just a year later, they would be arriving as conquering anti-heroes, having in the space of a year, accomplished the small feat of changing the face of music. Now the festivals headliners, Nirvana - and particularly Kurt Cobain, had become the subject of much public attention, and amidst a cloud of rumours and innuendo stirred up by the press, the appearance was as much anticipated for the spectacle as it was for the expected performance, a performance that would be the bands final in the U.K. What is captured on tape, hardly comes across as a band in its final moments - Live At Reading explodes with ferocity and moments of sheer brilliance. Granted it has its less than sparkling moments, but those are few and far between, and seem more a by-product of a band at odds with its own success, and adding verity to event.     The moments where Nirvana truly shine are too many to mention - the performance of \\"School\\" displays the skills and sound which made Dave Grohl such a key addition to the band. His drumming matches the visceral attack of Kurt's vocals, turning the performance into a thundering pummel that churns the crowd into a sea of screaming bodies. Other highlights include blistering performances of tracks from Nevermind, including \\"Breed,\\" and \\"Lithium,\\" the latter of which induces the crowd into a most memorable sing-a-long segment, serving to illustrate both the bands immense popularity at the time, and the potency of its songs.     Other highlights include those from the then forthcoming In Utero album, including the first ever performance of \\"Tourette's\\" and the soon to become classic \\"All Apologies.\\"

B001AQTWF2|4.0|Many fans and critics expected \\"I Look To You\\", the 2009 offering of Whitney Houston in her 25th year of career (although only a seventh proper album excluding film soundtracks), with mixed emotions and not-too-high expectations. They had good reasons - the singer's personal life had just recently risen from complete shreds and the several delays of the album release only fueled numerous speculations. The diva, however, effectively silenced the dissing rumors by putting out one solid and sleek album, again on the verge between pop and R&B.     Most reviewers mentioned a \\"deteriorating voice quality\\" in their evaluations of the album. They rather missed the point - much like with already her 1998 hit \\"My Love Is Your Love\\", where gymnastics and fire in Whitney's voice have ceased being the main instrument to reach the mainstream audience. Rather, it was the state-of-the-art production. Back in 1998, the top-class staple of writers and producers (including Missy Elliott, Wyclef Jean, Rodney Jerkins and Lauryn Hill) could - and delivered - a really trendy album that focused on the deft, cool production, even though the songs were almost as strong as ever. In 2009, Whitney (and her longtime business mentor Clive Davis) also assembled hot producers of the day, although the musical novelty per se is not too evident.     But it poses no problem, beginning with Alicia Keys, whose co-penned \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" opens the disc in a kind of old-school vibe. Even bigger and better songs are coming up with tracks 2 to 4. \\"Nothin` But Love\\" pounds with nicely electro-driven chorus vocals that give the song a very welcome euphoric mood. It paves the way for another mid-tempo jam, \\"Call You Tonight\\", a slice of pounding black pop written well and sung (yes!) very well, too. And then comes the centerpiece of the album, R. Kelly's title track, in the best traditions of his ballads (Michael Jackson's \\"You Are Not Alone\\" or Celine Dion duet \\"I'm Your Angel\\"). This anthem on drawing power from a higher source sums up the album's message and the hoarseness in Whitney's voice even enhances the song in becoming a touching, profound portrait of a great artist in her deserved comeback.    The rest of the album falls just short in reaching a classic fashion of the first four tracks, but it nevertheless remains very solid in comparison with other R&B artists of the day. Almost each track of \\"I Look To You\\" is memorable as a song, which is no mean feat these days - this decades, in fact. And although the collection could do without some rather ordinary fodder (especially \\"Worth It\\"), the length of the album is right. Furthermore, given the fact that her 1980's albums had their rather generous share of filler, the overall songwriting of ILTY may be Houston's best ever, alongside \\"My Love Is Your Love\\". Hey, it's great to hear an album so full of great hooks in 2009!
B002OVEB5S|5.0|I don't know how they keep doing it! Slayer is one of extremely few bands that has been making this kind of music for a very long time without ever wussing out or compromising. They haven't changed after nearly 30 years, yet somehow they manage to keep their music fresh and exciting, never stale or boring. Their sound and style are timeless... it never comes off dated. Not many bands can pull that off! In fact, I can't think of any others off the top of my head.<br /><br />This is up there with my favorites, like Seasons in the Abyss and Reign in Blood. It's so aggressive and angry, yet beautiful at the same time. It has the chugging, oddly danceable, headbangable rhythms that we know and love, Tom Araya's trademark spooky growl/scream vocals, and the virtuosity of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. How 4 musicians can make the same kind of music for nearly 30 years and have it be consistently so totally awesome is beyond me, and I hope they never stop!<br /><br />The lyrics are as good as the music. Kerry King is a very angry man, and I thank him for it! As I've mentioned in other reviews, I find Slayer's music therapeutic. The anger and aggression in it sucks my anger and aggression right out of me and leaves me smiling. This is the brutal, beautiful, fun music that I love, and it's already up there with my all-time favorite Slayer albums.<br /><br />Standout tracks for me are... all of them! There is not a single skippable track on this CD, which is something else that is exceedingly rare to be able to say. It's relentless awesomeness from start to finish.

The picture quality is also a quantum leap forward, having owned a bootleg copy for years, the improvement is clearly visible. Live At Reading is a must have for any Nirvana fan, casual or core.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Star Trek the Orignal Series came out 2 months before I was born.  I grew up watching all the re-runs from the 70's on.  I like The Next Generation and Voyager.  I couldn't get into Deep Space Nine.  My husband and 3 of my 4 children like to call me a sci-fi nerd.  I remind them I have friends, therefore, I'm a geek.  Only 1 of my children is into Star Trek and other Sci-fi. I MADE my other 3 children come with me. They thought it was gonna be like the Star Trek I grew up with.  WRONG!!  OMG!!  It was sooo good!!  It was rough, rugged, wild and FUNNY!!  All the actors got their character down.  All my \\"cool\\" teenager children loved it and was happy I made them go. I will be buying this movie as soon as it comes out!
0143038419|3.0|This is one of those books which will either stir a cauldron of hot venom or simmer positive learning to readers. Say what you will, but this book cannot rank #409 in Amazon book sales if no one is interested in buying and reading it. Yes, the author is someone we truly love to hate and can easily grow to hate because of all the self-indulging aspects of her journey. But who in our midst have not been guilty of some measure of that - even by the slightest margin. And to top the cherry on this cake, she goes and make a killing on the book deal for her story. Talk about getting paid for advertising one's self-indulgence. But what fascinates me more than anything else is that her book reallySOLD. So, what does that really say about the readers and society at large? May be, just may be, her story mirrors ours in some way, however small or minute. We all are plagued by the same issues, in one way or another. So, how will my review help you decide? If you are truly seeking pure entertainment, then I guess, this book won't bother you too much. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood takes it up and make a movie out of it. If you are interested to learn from this book, you will learn how NOT to do what she does, but find a better way to manage your angst or issues. Because no matter how great her life may be and how colourful her journey may be, she has done her fair share of damage to those around her. If you are interested in real spiritual learning and starting your own journey, then please read one of Tsem Tulku's books, cds or dvds and Pema Chodron's various titles in Amazon. For starters, try \\"EVERYTHING CHANGES, HAPPINESS IF NOT NOW, WHEN? and READY TO GO\\" from Tsem Tulku, or \\"THE WISDOM OF NO ESCAPE and WHEN THINGS FALL APART\\" from Pema Chodron. Then please let me know if my review has been helpful or not. Happy reading!

B002OUO6D6|5.0|I wasn't sure about this album at first.  I listened to it a few times and then set it aside.  I thought it was a bit too slow and a bit too much of the same.  I have it on my Ipod and when I put it on shuffle, the songs would come up from time-to-time and they began to really grab me.  Now I can't stop listening to it.  The songs have great stories and are told in music that is amazing.  Beautiful.  There isn't another songwriter/musician out there that can match this.  It is incredible how Mark can take any subject and turn it into a song.  He takes chances with his lyrics and succeeds mightily.  The story of a ship being grounded and torn apart put to music?; the story of an instrument maker; an arrogant rich person; a person who travels with the weather? Who else does this stuff and succeeds?  With each new album Mark becomes more and more content allow the other musicians to step forward.  He doesn't need to keep his guitar front and center.  The result is a melding of musicians into a tight cohesive group, each playing off the other.  This is truly an amazing work of art.  A classic.

0765316889|4.0|The first book was excellent and ended on a good note; though there were hints that there were problems ahead.  This book explores those troubles while taking a look at the issues associated with implementing a new form of government.  It effectively shows the difficulty of governing a people used to authoritarian rule and how difficult it would be to implement major reforms.<br /><br />Sanderson also explored what happens to people that suddenly gain or lose great power and how they deal with it.  Overall I found the character development to be very interesting.<br /><br />The world that Sanderson builds also continues to fascinate me.  The use of allomancy is very consistent and I am amazed at how much detail he went into.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series.  This book once again ends with trouble looming.  I am excited to finish this series.
0385504225|1.0|This book is simply...how can I say it nicely...awful! It is way too long and needs an editor urgently to cut about 150 pages of the pontificating prose out of it. The ending lands with a resounding, underwhelming and large THUD...skip this one.
B000002JSR|5.0|Just because Led Zeppelin did not include a song on an album did not mean that that song was bad, but just that Jimmy did not feel the song fit. This \\"collection of leftovers\\" is full of excellent songs that just did not fit with other albums. \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" is a classic example of a great song that was scratched from \\"In Through the Outdoor\\" at the last moment, not because the song was bad, far from it, but Page did not feel that it fit in with the other more softer songs. I love a lot of these songs and don't dislike any of them. None of them are garbage, because Led Zeppelin did not make garbage! As a Zeppelin fan I appreciate that Page chose to give us more songs. Forget these pompous windbags that feel they are too good to listen to these misfit songs.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|The Shield is one of those shows that rips you in on the first episode and keeps you coming back again and again. I can't watch TV on Tuesday nights in the Fall without thinking about The Shield. If you're a fan of dark and gritty shows this is the cat's meow. From the very first episode, you are forced to come to odds with Detective Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) the surprisingly likeable anti-hero of the show. Set in the fictional Barn district of LA, it is based around a corrupt gang-task force unit called the Strike Team.    Season One: The first episode is a gut shot. You spend the rest of the season trying to figure out how to like an anti-hero so dark you can't even begin to rationalize his deplorable actions. The deeply disturbing relationship between Captain Aceveda (Benito Martinez) and Mackey's Strike Team forms. Best season of the show, the show and Chiklis definitely earned their Golden Globes. 10/10    Season Two: The second season introduces a wider scope of bad guys for the Strike Team to deal with. It really builds on the anticillary characters and solidifies Mackey's survival instinct and Shane Vendrell's (Walton Goggins) bone-headed nature. The actions of the team in this season cast shockwaves that will last through out the course of the series.  9/10    Season Three: A slower season that deals with the conscience of the Strike Team in the aftermath of a major heist. The once tight family disengrates as the members struggle internally with how to handle their actions. Elsewhere in the Barn, Detective Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder) begins to make a tustle for reform while Detective \\"Dutch\\" Wagenbach (Jay Karnes)takes a disturbing turn into darkness. 8/10    Season Four: With the Strike Team seperated things take interesting paths. Strike Team members Lem, Mackey, and Gardocki try to keep things clean, while Vendrell and his new partner continue the old ways. Vendrell doesn't have the instincts and smarts of Mackey and soon winds up over his head in the employ of drug dealer Antwon Mitchell (Anthony Anderson). Glenn Close joins the cast as Captain Monica Rawling. A fast paced season that leaves you questioning just who to trust. 9/10    Season Five: In one of the most powerful seasons, IA agent Jon Kavanaugh (Forest Whitaker) enters the Barn. Tasked with taking down Mackey, Kavanaugh tears the already fractured Strike Team apart with evidence against Lem. Kavanaugh is Mackey's equal and the two square off constantly to destroy each other. The season finale is dark and disturbing leaving a tremendous aftermath that shatters the already tenenous Strike Team. 10/10    Season Six: After the events of the season five finale, Vic is on the warpath. With one hand he is vengance bound, on the other he is trying to save his career as brass tries to force him into retirment. Vandrell continues to seperate himself from the rest of the Strike Team as he falls in with the Armenian Mob and struggles with internal guilt. Wyms now promoted to the captain of the Barn is deadset on saving it from itself and all those that stand in its way.  7/10    Season Seven: The final season. Vic still set on vengance finally has a true target, while Vandrell goes entirely rogue on the lamb. Wyms and Dutch race against time to finally take down Mackey, while Gardocki and himself go darker than ever - hunting one of their own. Season Seven pits Vic against everyone he loves and tests his survival instinct to its core. In the end, it is a chilling season that should have earned Emmy nods for Michael Chiklis and Walter Goggins. 10/10    The series has its highs and lows, but on a whole remains a powerful piece and one of the best cop shows ever. This a series I've watched over and over again in marathon sessions. I owned all but the final season on DVD and have since given them away when word of the complete series finally came around.     This is a must have DVD collection and my favorite TV show of all time.

Live At Reading serves as a vibrant reminder as to why Nirvana belongs in the pantheon of great rock bands, and how they may likely be the last great and meaningful band to emerge in the past twenty years. Live At Reading captures the band at a crossroads - just a year before in 1991, the band played the very same festival, but was relegated to an afternoon performance somewhere in the middle of the multi-day, multi-band gathering. Just a year later, they would be arriving as conquering anti-heroes, having in the space of a year, accomplished the small feat of changing the face of music. Now the festivals headliners, Nirvana - and particularly Kurt Cobain, had become the subject of much public attention, and amidst a cloud of rumours and innuendo stirred up by the press, the appearance was as much anticipated for the spectacle as it was for the expected performance, a performance that would be the bands final in the U.K. What is captured on tape, hardly comes across as a band in its final moments - Live At Reading explodes with ferocity and moments of sheer brilliance. Granted it has its less than sparkling moments, but those are few and far between, and seem more a by-product of a band at odds with its own success, and adding verity to event.     The moments where Nirvana truly shine are too many to mention - the performance of \\"School\\" displays the skills and sound which made Dave Grohl such a key addition to the band. His drumming matches the visceral attack of Kurt's vocals, turning the performance into a thundering pummel that churns the crowd into a sea of screaming bodies. Other highlights include blistering performances of tracks from Nevermind, including \\"Breed,\\" and \\"Lithium,\\" the latter of which induces the crowd into a most memorable sing-a-long segment, serving to illustrate both the bands immense popularity at the time, and the potency of its songs.     Other highlights include those from the then forthcoming In Utero album, including the first ever performance of \\"Tourette's\\" and the soon to become classic \\"All Apologies.\\"    On the technical side, the 5.1 Surround mix mastering done by Bob Ludwig is nothing short of incredible. Having been fortunate enough to work from the original multi-track masters, the sound freed from those tapes is a revelation, and reason enough for any lagging fans still listening in simple stereo, to make the leap to a surround system.  The picture quality is also a quantum leap forward, having owned a bootleg copy for years, the improvement is clearly visible. Live At Reading is a must have for any Nirvana fan, casual or core.
0679882820|1.0|There are some true gems among the Dr. Seuss books, but this isn't one of them.<br /><br />Fails both as poetry (the lines don't scan) and as onomatopoeia - \\"splatt\\" for lightning? Dreadful.<br /><br />I'm truly astonished to find that, nearly forty years since its first publication (1970), we're still wasting trees on this.<br /><br />Try either Dr. Seuss's ABC or Sandra Boyton's \\"Moo Baa La La La\\" for an infinitely superior alternative.
0783225849|5.0|I was 15 years old in the summer of 1960 when a buddy and I went to see \\"Psycho\\" at the Colfax Theater in South Bend, Indiana.  The Colfax was torn down years ago, but I have wondered since then how many of the post-\\"Psycho\\" seats in that majestic old house were still damp when the wrecking ball brought it down.  No, \\"Psycho\\" didn't make me wet my pants, but it scared the hell out of me.  I had never seen anything like it, and compared with its expert heightening of tension and its masterful \\"conning\\" of the audience, the supposedly scary pictures from the Fifties--\\"It Came From Beneath the Sea,\\" \\"Them!\\", and pictures like it--were shown up for the shallow and tawdry efforts they really were.  Contemporary efforts at pictures like this one are mere feasts of cruelty, and present the uneasy spectacle of pointless and explicit human suffering as entertainment.  Hitchcock, a subtle and intelligent director, achieved the Greek ideal of exciting horror and pity in his audiences.  In that sense, I don't think there has ever been a film as successful in its way as \\"Psycho,\\" and I doubt if there ever will be.
0618918248|5.0|By far one of the best books I have ever read. The book in a way frightens me, because it makes you remember that there are people out there that don't believe in evolution, that talk to themselves and actually believe that a sky fairy is listening. These people are leaders in government, teachers and so on. It's sick that young children are forced to attend religious schools and be brought up to believe in a bible. Children should have a choice. I dunno. But a lot of religious people scare me. Weak minds. Killing people cause \\"God\\" spoke to them. If you're on the fence of religion, do yourself a favor and come over to the side that thinks for itself. ATHEISTS UNIT!
B002CMLIJ6|5.0|Despite all the mixed reviews about this movie, I still went out and purchased this movie.  This is the best X-men movie yet, possibly the best comic book adaptation next to Transformers.  It told the entire story of Wolverine and how he came to lose his memory which reflected in the original trilogy movies.  I really loved this movie with its great characters but I was a little disappointed that Jean Grey was not shown but overall great movie.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|Recvd the dvd and cd pack. the animated feature is ok at best. just snipits of slayer songs.  not for the weak at heart thought.  the CD however is a different story.  This is their most aggressive release in quite some time. an obvious improvement over Christ Illusion. Only weak point is vocal volume, could be better.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Excellent flash, my second SB-900 and certainly not the last.  A little too pricey, but it's OK. It's a very good flash does all you need and looks like will live forever!
B002C6K7NA|4.0|We have two 1 star reviews, not on the CD but complaining this is not Skynyrd - I say, get over it!    I also grew up on the Skynyrd diet, loved the music and thought it died in '77 but that was over 30 years ago and those that have said the band has matured and evolved are right. There have been many personel changes and you can't tell me this isn't one of the most unlucky bands around but they have kept the name alive, they did reform as a tribute to the original band, they did reform and they have produced one hell of an album.    Yes the music has changed, yes country has caught up with it but lets face it country music now is more like southern rock than country music ever was back in the seventies so I guess that says everything.    Hey it's 29 years since I last saw Skynyrd live and I know I have matured in that time so why shouldn't the music? I loved Skynyrd back in the 70s, I thought I wouldn't buy another Skynyrd album but through the music of the Rossington Collins Band, the Tribute Tour (where I cringed at the re-recording of traditional classics) to a band today keeping the music and legend alive, people should take these guys as they come, listen to the music as it is today and like the band have done, move on!     God and Guns is an album for today from a bunch of guys that have earned the rights to being Lynyrd Skynyrd.   From the heavy entry of Still Unbroken, sounding a little bit like Nickleback through a range of southern classics to the final Gifted Hands, playing the bird for free, this is great southern music and if you think it smacks of country, let me ask where today's country comes from, the American South.    If you can't get over Skynyrd in the 70's don't buy this CD but honestly, you don't know what you're missing.
B000ZECQ08|3.0|Of the MANY MANY important things left out of this movie, the thing I found myself missing the most was the scene where Dumbledore tells the Durley's off finally. We Harry lovers have been waiting through 5 other books and films for that moment, and it was a scene I most looked forward to seeing in the movie.. only to see it replaced with some hideously lame scene about Harry flirting with a girl in a diner. REALLY??????? Guh. I felt robbed by this movie for many reasons, but that was the biggest crime of all.<br /><br />I'm very worried how underwhelming the next two films will be :(
B002O4J4DO|5.0|As a band that had tremendous top-40 success during the hey-day of freeform radio, Creedence Clearwater Revival stood with one foot planted firmly in each world. Their LPs were recorded in well-produced stereo, offered extended jams, thoughtful cover songs and deep album cuts that found room on underground FM stations such as Bay Area legends KMPX and KSAN. But above ground, the band's music was remixed into powerful mono, edited for length and unleashed via AM powerhouses. AM's narrow frequency range added emphasis to the music's midrange, focusing listeners on Fogerty's vocals and stinging guitar leads, and further revealing the band's rhythm section to be among the most rock-solid and potent of its era. Their driving rhythms are just that much more driving in mono, and the band's pop tunes sprang easily from a single speaker in the middle of a car's dashboard.<br /><br />Fogerty wrote with the goal of placing his songs alongside the R&B hits the group had grown up loving on Oakland's KWBR and Sacramento's KRAK. His originals stood toe-to-toe on album, airwave and top-40 chart with covers of \\"Suzie Q,\\" \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" and \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine.\\" Included here are the A- and B-sides of thirteen original singles, ranging from 1968's \\"Porterville\\" (b/w \\"Call it Pretending\\") through 1972's \\"Someday Never Comes\\" (b/w \\"Tearin' Up the Country\\"). Also included is the single-edit of \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" (b/w \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\") that was released in 1976, four years after the group disbanded, and both sides of the stereo promotion-only experiment \\"45 Revolutions Per Minute.\\" The latter, a montage of production ideas, sound effects, musical bridges and comedy bits previously appeared as bonus tracks on the 2008 reissue of [[ASIN:B001AKTZOG Pendulum]].<br /><br />Most of these songs are well-known to even casual listeners, as Creedence often broke both sides of their singles. The few less familiar cuts are the group's first B-side \\"Call It Pretending,\\" Stu Cook's \\"Door to Door\\" (an album cut from [[ASIN:B000000XCM Mardi Gras]] and the B-side of \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\"), and Doug Clifford's \\"Tearin' Up the Country\\" (also from Mardi Gras, and the B-side of \\"Someday Never Comes\\"). Strung end-to-end, these singles provide the AM listener's view of Creedence Clearwater Revival's success. While FM listeners grooved to 8:37 of \\"Suzie Q,\\" AM listeners enjoyed a concise 4:33 edit, and while album buyers sat back to enjoy album jams like \\"Graveyard Train,\\" \\"Keep on Chooglin'\\" and \\"Ramble Tamble,\\" singles buyers got another gumdrop every three or four months. The singles form an intertwined, yet separate, artistic arc that the band carved out in parallel to their albums.<br /><br />Concord delivers thirty tracks on two CDs, each screened with a vintage Fantasy record label. The CDs are housed in a standard jewel case, together with a 20-page booklet that includes new liner notes by Ben Fong-Torres. Torres' essay provides a genial trip through Creedence's success on the radio, with quotes from 1960's boss jocks, but it's light on the particulars of these mono mixes and edits. A separate cardboard sleeve houses a DVD of four Creedence promotional videos: \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine,\\" \\"Bootleg,\\" \\"I Put a Spell on You,\\" and \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door.\\" Staged in studios and aboard a riverboat these are real treats, with the band looking youthful and happy. There are groovy dancers on \\"Bootleg\\" and psychedelic effects of \\"I Put a Spell On You,\\" and the black-and-white footage of \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" looks like it was filmed in the band's rehearsal space. A folded poster insert reproduces many original 7\\" picture sleeves and completes a cardboard slip-cased package that is, in its own way, as important as the band's original albums.

B00004RF8J|5.0|Item was shipped quickly in good condition.  No problems at all, so very pleased.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|Many think a Greatest Hits release is just the record company cashing in on music that fans already own or that the Greatest Hits omits what they consider to be the best tracks and for some the Foo Fighters Greatest Hits may be looked on in this way.  You will never please everyone!    For me, if most of the tracks are ones I would include in a playlist taken from the band's many albums, then the Greatest Hits is probably just that and with this release that is certainly the case.    The good thing about the Foo Fighters music is that whether released as a single or not their \\"Hits\\" ar really the best of their album tracks, some happen to have achieved commercial succcess, other great songs getting no air play at all but all are great examples of the band's music.      From hit tracks like the 'Pretender from Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace through to This is a Call and Big Me from their debut release, Foo Fightes, this is the band at their best, a great representation of the Foo Fighter's first 15 years and a great cd for those that want a first taste of the band, are casual fans or already have the music but want a listen to the best without changing from CD to CD.    To top it off, and selling in Australia at the same price as a normal new release CD, comes a second DVD disc containing all the Greatest Hits Videos so you can listen while watching your heros and enjoying the warped humour that has become a trademark of the bands releases over the years.    Great value and highly recommended!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I just came home from that great movie and I was positively suprised in many ways. Michael seemed to be happy and it was nice to see that he put together a totally new crew with young musicians, dancers and so on. You can see that he wanted to give others a way to show their best. It was always clear to me that when it comes to music Michael new exactly what he wanted and the way he wanted it to sound. But to see how he discusses details with others is just a fine thing.    Furthermore his vocal qualities were as great as always. At the Dangerous tour I got the feeling that almost 50% of the show were playback but at these rehearsals you could listen to at least 90% live - Michael in high quality.    Maybe it was good that he died at the age of 50 so we remember him the way he was. He never grew old really...and that has always been his dream. He lived a life of Peter Pan of the Pop world and beyond.    A great musician without any doubt, one of the greatest.    This film (or concert) compared to his former shows would have been his best, I am really sure.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|This movie was great. I liked it much better than the first two. It had the creepiest, scariest zombies in the series so far, and some very interesting twists and turns. Also, they really made you feel like it was the end of the world in this movie. The action scenes were excellent! This movie had hordes of flesh-eating zombies, mutant dogs, flocks of killer crows, and the obligatory boss monster at the end. The ending also left you with the knowledge of more ass-kicking to come and wanting to know what will happen next. If you liked the first two Resident Evil films, you will definitely like this one.
B000GB775E|4.0|this movie was ok not as bad as the critics was taking about it was entertaining

B002OB9KPE|5.0|Having just started listening to Transatlantic in the last year, I would say this is the best of the three studio albums.  I've heard it about 5 times now.  The sound of the album is MUCH better than the first one - not so muddy or sloppy sounding.  This album is crisp and clear, with ballsy bass sounds and drums to match.  To be honest, the first listen it reminded me of Tales of Topographic Oceans by Yes. I'm not sure why, since I haven't played that album for probably 15 years.  I'll have to play it this week to see if I'm way off.  But the bass definitely reminds me of Chris Squire.    The songs all strung together really work nice, much better than the new Porcupine tree album (the incident).  There are some really good jams in there, along with a \\"radio\\" songs.  Plus a couple preachy ones, but they're not too bad. The numbered song tracks are great (you can effortlessly skip the radio song and preachy ones if you want)    Disk two is has four extra studio tracks that are are all pretty weak, and 4 covers that are OK.  I like the Santana and Genesis cover.  Return of the giant hogweed?  I have no idea why they picked that old 1971 Genesis song, but it certantly is a jam.  Makes me want to pull out the old Nursery Cryme album and give it another listen, too! I bet nobody has covered that song before.    To sum up, The Whirlwind is a better album that their first two, in my opinion.  The new and creative music writing might have been a little better on their first ablum, but this one sounds so much better.  It's written, played, and recorded very well.  I would have liked to see some guest guitarists in there for some more inspired solos, but I guess you can't have everything.  Too bad there's not a DVD-A version (yet)  5-stars compared to everything else put out this year.  4-stars compared to past and present progressive rock albums.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I truly enjoyed the latest CD from Michael Buble.  His soulful voice brings new excitement to the songs.  I highly recommend for all the Buble fans in your life!
0385504225|5.0|Received this book ahead of schedule. It was in \\"like new\\" condition. A best seller at an excellent price.
0060764899|5.0|My edition of this book is subtitled \\" Book 1 in the chronicles of Narnia\\". Interestingly the author wanted this book read after \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" where he details how the lion Aslan created Narnia and gave the gift of speech to its animals. I mention this fact since many readers have access to the seven Narnia books and may wish to read \\"Nephew\\" first. Of course I am assuming you are reading these comments BEFORE you read the books!<br />  In any event \\"Wardrobe\\" introduced us to the Pevensie children Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Who travel to the land of Narnia by entering and exiting a \\"magic\\" wardrobe in the attic of an old Professor. It is not my intent in these short comments to summarize the entire story, after all discovering the delights therein are one of the prime pleasures in reading. One of the pleasures for this reader was the illustration at the beginning of each chapter by Pauline Baynes.
B000000I02|2.0|I just don't get this album.  It's annoying, disjointed, and hard to listen to.  Maybe it's like Piers Anthony's Macroscope - it will only work if you have a certain intelligence level.  I guess I'm not at that level?  I see people really love this one, but I can't stand it.  If you are into Caravan or Camel, this album is nothing like those bands.  I only gave it two stars because its better than all the one-star radio garbage.  At least it's interesting and different - just like Frank Zappa's Jazz from Hell - and equally as difficult to listen to as the FZ album.  I ebayed mine after giving it a serious chance.     Just goes to show you how different people's music tastes are.  I love all those progressive bands from the 70's, but this one is a real dog, in my opinion.    And this is the one people wanted if they could have one album on a desert island?  Geez....
B00260HH3K|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie It had A lot of action scenes & special effects.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I have seen this movie twice so far and plan on seeing it one more time.  It was absolutely amazing to see Michael putting his show together.  Something we have never seen before.  He is such an amazing performer and a kind, caring person.  Parts will make you laugh and parts will leave you wishing it didn't all end on June 25th.  People had said that Michael would probably not approve of these sessions being shown because he was such a perfectionist, but Kenny Ortega would not have done it if he felt it was hurtful to Michael.  It was well put together and really showed a side of Michael that most people have never seen.  To see him create his vision was such a great gift he shared with us.  His passion for his work and dedication to his fans are very evident in this movie.  He cared so much for people -  its really a shame that the media couldnt let him be -  He is finally getting the recognition that he truly deserves.  RIP Michael and Thank you Kenny Ortega for allowing us to see Michael create his final curtain call.
B00006IU73|5.0|Being a drummer for the last 20+ years I eagerly seek out new and interesting music. Porcupine Tree has been around since the 90's but with this album they have created a masterpiece. Admittedly I'm a little late to the Tree party but I am so glad I discovered them. The writing. The craftsmanship. The atmospherics. The mood. This album has it all. Steven Wilson's immense talent comes to the fore on every song. Just incredible creativity. Gavin Harrison's ridiculous drumming takes aim at Neil Pearts king of prog rock drumming throne. Even Danny Carey is a fan. Colin Edwin's inventive bass playing and his clean tone represent an understated sense of calm amid at times a firestorm of energy. And Richard Barbieri's keyboard and sense of mood and dynamics sit just right in songs that sweep the current along. All four guys clicking into one unified purpose. To create art for arts sake. Not for personal triumph. These guys are musical artists. Phenominal. Buy this record. Then buy the next one. And the next. And pick up their newest release, \\"The Incident.\\" You'll be very happy you did. And like me, wonder why you haven't been listening to them sooner.
1582701709|5.0|What can I say? You MUST buy this book and read it several times! Truly amazing! You have to discover the secret for yourself ~ no amount of explanations or reviews can do this for you. It will change your life, or at least the way you think!!! 'Nuff said! Enjoy!!!
0385532458|5.0|America's greatest contribution to literary forms is the short story. Just refer to a strange looking gentleman named Poe. So why is it that so many prominent American writers today seem to have forgotten the short story?      John Grisham to the rescue! His recently published collection of short stories, \\"FORD COUNTY\\", is one of the best books of 2009.      The book is composed of seven beautifully written tales from Grisham's roots in Mississippi. Each story is a gem! The mostly contemporary plots range from hilarity (\\"Blood Drive\\") to heartache (\\"Michael's Room\\"). By the end of the last selection (\\"Funny Boy\\"), the reader wishes there were seven more.       This is a great writer at his best, and one hopes that in the future Mr. Grisham will bring us more tales from Ford County. Get the book and enjoy every word. \\"Ford County\\" is superb!                                                                                BRUCE SPERBER
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Love this DVD -  I got the one that looks like a miniture book with the 2 cd's.  There are pictures from the movie and lists all the songs.  I really love the \\"This is it\\" song.  Could not play it enough.  Have seen the movie twice and hope to see it at least 1 more time on the big screen.  The second CD has a version of \\"shes out of my life\\" that I have never heard before.  Its a demo.  There are also a couple more demos on the 2nd CD.  The poem is amazing.  Hearing Michaels voice reading the poem is just fantastic. Love it
B001PPLIFU|3.0|Action was jerky and did not flow well. It really seemed pieced together much like a movie is actually shot.    Script did not flow well either. Scenes to short,and to many changes. Hard to follow storyline and hard to keep track of the characters. Casino Royale was much better. A slower pace but with action that would pull you in and end with a spectacular finish.
0525457585|5.0|Although I haven't watched this movie recently, I've always loved it. And after reading this book, I can't wait for the new remake to come out. The movie is very loosely based on the book, but never the less I love them both. Although the book is easy to follow, the detail of the picture the words paint in your mind is wonderfully elaborate. I received the book last week and have been reading it every chance I get and I just finished it a couple minutes ago. It makes me want to go home and watch the movie.<br />I am 34 years old and don't do much fictional reading, but if you liked the movie this book is a must read. There's just so many more characters, plots and background information than in the movie. I have such a warm fuzzy feeling inside now :)
B001QBC4AG|5.0|Even though Sell Out is one of my all-time favorite albums, I ignored this release for a year, glancing at the track list and thinking, ahh, no great shakes here...I mean, they added a whole 2nd disc, with TWO mixes of Someone's Coming, and DIDN'T include the treasure Melancholia at all, which was on the previous 1-DISC release?  If you've had similar p-shawish reservations......     Let them go.  This is a wonderful release.  Turns out there are some 9 or 10 items here that weren't on the previous release, and most of these have NEVER been released:  *mono Our Love Was, Is ~ the bad news: my rare, if muddy BBC version with the country-western guitar solo isn't really a BBC performance; the good news: it's the mono mix, now in pristine quality on this release!  *Our Love Was, Is, take 12 ~ a truly alternate version to boot!  *Relax ~ demo (none of the Scoops had this!)..Pete doing his best Keith imitation on drums.  *Sodding About ~ not just another lost commercial as I'd whiningly feared, but a MONSTER unreleased instrumental!  Not half as long as the excellent Hall of the Mountain King, but makes up for it in ferocity...a heavier display of Ox-power than any other track on the album.  Stacks up nicely to the studio Young Man Blueses of a year later. [added comment: I just found out this was the \\"Signal 30\\" instrumental that circulated on bootleg; well, now it's official! Is it me, or was Pete's Tommy outtake \\"Trying to Get Through\\" based on this jam?]  *Summertime Blues ~ surprisingly, a different studio version from Odds n Sods/BBC.  A bit shorter, but another one from the vaults nevertheless.  *Glittering Girl ~ not just two mixes, but two bonafide different performances (one by Pete, one by Roger, vocally), recorded months apart.  The latter is another first-time release!   *I Can See For Miles/early mono mix ~ pre-overdub version, for completists and geeks only, perhaps, but isn't that us?  An interesting listen.  Though the added dressings sweetened it to perfection, this shows how few of those dressings there actually were.  *Rael remake ~ didn't know what this meant from the cover (a 2009 dub mix?), but it's a whole different take from back in the day!     All this, plus a few more commercials and a pair of highly enjoyable hidden items I'll maintain the silence on....and spiced with outtake cover photos of each of our heroes (I remember the John one from the tribute photo montage in 2002) makes this utterly worth having.  As for dear departed Melancholia, I'm content with the explanation it was recorded in early 68, after the album's release ~ but I'll hang onto the '95 version.     And one should, for another good reason:  RAEL.  It's all well and good the compilers wanted to use the original masters--and the bonus \\"early\\" mono mix late on disc 2 does contain the long-lost 2nd verse, so it's here--but I think it's ridiculous they didn't use the '95 mix for the stereo album on disc 1.  That mix finally restored that glaringly spliced verse, achieving the definitive version of this song after 28 years, and now you go back to an inferior version?  Did the ghost of Kit Lambert influence this decision?  I mean, Pete threw a chair thru the control room window over this at the time....  Not a deal-breaker, though ~ just keep your previous one, if it's the '95 version with bonus tracks.       On the mixes ~ need to listen to the mono mix again, but I agree with the reviewer that Someone's Coming greatly benefits from the mono (who'd have thought?).  But Odorono suffers ~ Pete's voice is too low in the mix, and it just doesn't sparkle the way the stereo one does (and the way this song should! listen to the \\"ripped her glittering gown\\" line in stereo vs. mono).  Nice to have both the \\"regular\\" (stereo) and the \\"shaky\\" (mono) mixes of the acoustic Mary-Ann with the Shaky Hands in one place.  Previously, the 80's cd had the regular and 95's had the shaky (albeit in a new stereo version)--so I can finally ditch the former cd, there's absolutely nothing to recommend it now.  Even the Rael purists get their original mix back on the new Deluxe.      The two different electric versions of Mary-Ann are under the same roof now, too.  My Way (Easy Goin' Guy) could've been squeezed on, I guess, but that and the other Summertime Blues are already on Odds n Sods.     If all this sounds like geekdom...it is.  If you've never heard The Who Sell Out, get the one-disc '95 edition with bonus tracks ~ just one version of each song for your listening pleasure.  If/WHEN, however, this album is imprinted on your heart; or, if you're a Who nut, or serious collector, or all of the above ~ YOU'RE GONNA WANT THIS.   Too great a treasure trove to pass on.

1594488878|5.0|I haven't laughed so much in years.  Hornby is dead on funny and this book will brighten your day.
1410420442|5.0|This is the 2nd book of The Hunger Games, and it doesn't disappoint. As with every book that has a sequel to it I am always skeptical, especially since The Hunger Games was such an amazing read, I was afraid my expectations for Catching Fire were beyond what it could ever be, but I was wrong. This book will have you up late at night, ignoring friends or family, even giving up food it is that good. The entire time reading I was in a trance, Collins writes so well, I find it hard to concentrate on anything else but the characters. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't had the chance of reading this book yet, thus I wont describe the book too much, just know that you need to read it!<br /><br />Life after the Hunger Games is not exactly what Katniss thought it would be, and no where near as private. Once her and Peeta stepped of the train returning to District 12, her life changed drastically. Her family and her moved into the Victors Village house, with Haymitch and Peeta as neighbors. The Capitol reporters came and went, but now that it is time for the Victory Tour, they are back. Peeta and her once again play the 'love' card, but now that President Snow has seen through Katniss' lie, he will make things a bit more difficult for her. There is talk about rebellion, about finally relieving themselves from the Capitol's firm grip on their lives, but with so much at stake Katniss doesn't know whether to go along with it, or run away to safety. With the 75th Annual Hunger Games just around the corner, things get worse. Fighting for your life is one thing in the Hunger Games, but now out of the Hunger Games, Katniss finds herself fighting for so much more than that, and the Capitol doesn't want that.<br /><br />Such a great read, I recommend all of you to read it. I am still trying to figure out if I like it more than The Hunger Games. I initially didnt know what to expect, and I got so much more than I was ready for. Collins has done it again and captivated me with her story.ated me with her story.
0307716988|5.0|I'm the kinda girl who doesn't believe in \\"rumors\\" or gossip thats has been passed \\"through the grape vine\\" only to be mis-construde when it finally reaches its listener!  So when I heard that the \\"Michael Jackson AutoBio, Moonwalker\\" was going to be Re-Issued after his death I was intrigued to read it and hear from the man himself, Michael Jackson and his view of his life.    I dove into the book on a cold evening and finished it that next afternoon.  Its an EASY READ but very gripping.  To read the words of Michael Jackson, about his life and the PROS's and CON's of it was very interesting.  Being a Fan of Michael Jackson, I had already had alot insight on Mj.  This book displays Mj and his accent into Musical RoyaltY!    His humble beginings in Gary, Indiana to Encino, California, and finally to Neverland Ranch!  Though the book is written by him and had many wonderful tidbits about his life as a SUPER MEGA STAR you still get a sense that he was holding back.  He was being a bit illusive with his words.  Not that that is \\"bad\\" at all.  On the contrary I think its rather genius.  I mean alot of his appeal is the fact that he was seemingly an untouchable, excentrix, and at times awkward man!  Michael infact understood the mystery and mystic of his celebrity.  He used that the best he could and got the best results from it...    WORLD WIDE FAME and the Lasting title of \\"King of POP\\" and the \\"WORLDS GREATEST ENTERTAINER\\" (courtesy of Barry Gordy) :)    So in all I'd advise any Michael Jackson Fan to purchase this book and include it into your collection.  We sadly won't be getting any \\"NEW\\" wrtings or words of wisdom from the Masterful Genius himself ever again, why not treasure what we have! <3
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown is always a good read. I had trouble putting this one down. I found one inconsistency and it was a little preachy at the end, but great character development and exciting action. The book imparted interesting information--technical, scientific, Masonic, and D.C. architectural detail. I particularly like Brown because you can read him for the action and the \\"pretend information\\", but also for a heap of reliable \\"real\\" information. For those reasons, both Dan Brown and Daniel Silva are among my favorite authors.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Oh I get it...Bob Dylan wanted to put out an album of traditional Christmas Songs, as sung by a drunken Kermit-The-Frog. Well, not exactly. What I think he was intending to do here was a collection of Christmas Carols guaranteed to drive your in-laws out of your house before you have to watch them stuff their faces on your Christmas bounty....Well maybe it was Bob trying to get back at every living Christan, for forcing him to convert from Judiasm to Christinity and then back to Judiasm again. No, actually what Bob was attempting is an Album of Christmas music that could be used to interrogate detainees at Guantanamo Bay, until they spill their guts and reveal every terrorist plot ever conceived.     Congatulations Bob, you've succeeded at every level....Kermit admits to being a lush. Your in-laws are running like theives in the night, looking for the nearest McDonalds. And Guantanomo Bay has been shut tight and quiet, with all the Al Qaeda terrorists begging for water-boarding....\\"Anything just no more of Bob's Christmas music, PLEASE!\\"....Oh and did I mention, Bob Dylan was last seen at Kennedy Airport, chanting with a group of pajama-wearing Hare Krishnas. It seems Bob has converted yet again. One last favor Bob, next time you get the urge to put out a Holiday Album, keep it a little more along the lines of Bob Dylan Sings the great songs of Arbor Day....Or how about Dylan Sings traditional songs of Ground Hog Day...Afterall, who could resist \\"I saw mommy kissing Punxstawney Phil underneath the Feastavis Pole last night?\\" Now that would be killer.

0553260111|4.0|If you have ever read a fantasy novel you know the general idea:<br /><br />A character or characters is suddenly made aware that they are the key to solving a great problem of their time.<br />Then they are thrust out into to the world in a strange adventure that they could have barely imagined before.  That is the basic flow of this novel.  However Ludlum manages to keep me on the edge of my seat travelling through europe and delving deeps into the conspiracy.<br /><br />This is the story of Jason Bourne who wakes up on a fishing boat and is nursed back to health by an alcoholic physician.  Through the healing process they discover that Jason has an implant that references a bank account.  Jason also seems to have an uncanny knack of self defense and/or violence.  It is decided that Jason would go investigate the bank account.  When he does it unleashes an entire government agency to pursue him.  Which agency and why, we have no idea, just that they do not seem to be friendly.  As the book goes on we are introduced to Cain and Carlos.  Two rival executioners.  Cain has is new and been assassinating prominent figures in Asia, while Carlos is the world leader in high level executions, based primarily in Europe.<br /><br />Through the novel we see Bourne as his memory slowly returns and he is sent from one location to another, chasing Carlos,or Cain, or being chased by the shadowy government agency.<br /><br />It is a thrilling and exciting spy novel which has almost nothing to do with the Matt Damon movies.  Carlos is the reason for everything in this book and he is not even in the film.  You will enjoy this book more if you tell yourself that the films are called \\"The Matt Damon Action Spy Trilogy\\" and remove any connections between book and film.  The only similarities are the name and the fact that the main character has amnesia.  That's about it.<br /><br />T
B002OVEB5S|4.0|I'm a huge Slayer fan.  This album is great, even though it's pretty short, clocking in at under 40 minutes.  All Slayer fans will enjoy the album, but no one should buy the \\"Deluxe Edition\\".  The DVD contains a short, cheaply animated film called \\"Playing With Dolls\\" that is truly terrible.  Incredibly amateur film making.  For those who are buying the deluxe version to hear the non-album track \\"Atrocity Vendor\\", all you get is about a 30 second clip of the song, contained within the film, not the entire thing.  The song was omitted from the album, and is simply not available yet.  All the videos in the 20 minute film follow this structure, just 30-45 second clips of Slayer's new songs woven in with this horrible film.  There are no complete videos or anything, nor any extra bonus features.<br /><br />Like I said, I love Slayer, and I really like the new album, but you would be much better off buying the standard version for much less money (unless you just want the cool case).  Trust me, the 20 minute film is not worth your extra dollars.  I expected much more, which is why I gave this product 4 out 5.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I just love the WALLE storyline and was very excited to be able to purchase the dvd at a fair price on Amazon. My family absolutely loves to watch it.

B001VPJZ36|5.0|I just watched this again the other night on HBO. This is one of those movies that they really did a good job with. When I watched this movie, it made me think about a argument I had not too long ago with a fellow worker about the moon landing. I still can't believe that there are people out there that believe we didn't go to the moon, and that it just happened in Hollywood. This movie really does justice to those men who piloted the Apollo 13 Mission. Tom Hanks and crew did a great job tipping their hats to these men. If you like movies that have great story, reality, people coming together is crisis, than you really should give Apollo 13 a look. I am glad I have this on DVD, so I can watch with my kids someday.
0312360266|4.0|Originally released in paperback, this series has now been re-issued in hardcover.<br /><br />By now, you would think young adult readers would be getting tired of the whole vampire genre, but the hunger continues to grow by leaps and bounds. Critics seem to compare every new vampire book to the TWILIGHT series, but I think this is selling some great books short.<br /><br />MARKED is the first book in the House of Night series and I feel you need to take a look at the clever writing and interesting twist to this time-worn subject. Cast senior (mom P. C.) and Cast junior (daughter Kristin) introduce us to the world of a vampire finishing school some have described as TWILIGHT meets HARRY POTTER. The House of Night is a school for fledgling vampires-to-be - where those who have been \\"marked\\" come to go through the change and learn how to be true vampires.<br /><br />Fledgling vampires are marked by a vampire tracker for the change. This is how we are introduced to the main character, Zoey Redbird. One day Zoey is a normal teenager just trying to fit in and the next moment she is marked as different from the rest. But not only is she different from her human friends, she is also different from other fledglings. All fledglings are instantly \\"tattooed\\" with the outline of a moon on their foreheads - the symbol they have been chosen. However, Zoey's mark is entirely filled in after a dream confrontation with the Goddess Nyx.<br /><br />Zoey leaves behind her family - a mother who is the victim of emotional spouse abuse, a step-father who is a religious fanatic, and Grandma Redbird, her Cherokee grandmother (on her mother's side). She also leaves behind her football player boyfriend who has started to drink excessively and her best friend who talks more than she listens. Zoey's mother and step-father are narrow-minded religious nuts, but her grandmother is supportive and helps her make it to the House of Night in time. Zoey's friends at first are scared of her, but then try to reconnect to disastrous results.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, on her first day at the House of Night, Zoey meets a High Priestess-in-training who immediately turns into a nemesis. But Zoey soon learns she has unusual abilities - she is able to call all 5 elements - Earth, Wind, Water, Fire and Spirit. She realizes she has been chosen by the Goddess Nyx for a specific purpose and she is determined to follow her destiny.<br /><br />MARKED is a fast read and I did not want it to be over - good think I already had the 2nd book - BETRAYED - waiting in the wings. It's well-written and held my interest from start to finish and I look forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.y to reconnect to disastrous results.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, on her first day at the House of Night, Zoey meets a High Priestess-in-training who immediately turns into a nemesis.

015206396X|5.0|I have 2 kids and a home to take care of, all of which went semi-neglected for 4 days while I read this beautiful book.  Although it is intended for young adults, I don't know a lover of fine writing who would not enjoy this book.  The description of the world Kristin Cashore has created is fascinating.  The characters are very likable.  The love story is believable and tender.  I can't wait to read Fire!  Hopefully many more will follow.
B001GEJ7XU|5.0|These are some of the Argerich standards released on CD by Deutsche Grammophon in the 1980s and 1990s, and they are well worth the price of this collection. Her sensitivity and intensity are represented here, and although critics complain about the uncontrolled energy of a madwoman, I don't hear it in any of these pieces. Even the difficult Liszt Sonata in B-min sounds just right. Check out the sweet vid on Youtube showing Martha Argerich and Nelson Freire practicing and visiting.
B002T09BPE|2.0|Let me say this first: this girl is a brilliant guitarist. She has a LOT of potential... However, at the moment, it is being completely wasted. Wasted, on *pop*-rock. The lyrics are mostly trite, pretty shallow, and cliche, and the bit of good guitar that does get in there is brought down by singing that is mediocre at best, and rhythms and melodies that we've all heard before; her guitar solos are the best part of it all. What this girl needs is to form a band... she's got the guitar covered, but she needs a better singer, a powerhouse to match her mad guitar (heh, she should get together with Adam Lambert and form a supergroup... he can be the Plant to her Page), and much better percussion, and with the divided work, they can focus better on their own respective areas, and focus on working together to compose some really original music. She has so much potential to help bring back the Golden Age of Rock, but she's being too hasty and putting out a mediocre top-20 album, and thereby hugely compromising her talent: like i said, her brilliant guitar playing is compromised by bad, trite composition that is far too similar to the likes of Carrie underwood for comfort. Let's hope the next album is original, fresh, and showcases her talent.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I loved the classic Snow White movie we owned and watched on VHS for years.  Now that I have seen the Diamond Edition Blu Ray version, I wonder why I was stuck in the dark ages for so long!  The clarity was amazing.  This is a true story of classic meets up with technology.
1594132666|4.0|Like many of the reviewers, at first I found the book almost insufferable with all the navel-gazing and whining, but I'm glad I continued reading, because it got much better as it progressed. As a whole, the book does tell a well-rounded story about a personal and spiritual journey towards balance and fulfillment.<br /><br />I found the Italy section boring; it has some funny parts, but mostly it is just Liz whining about her ex-husband, her ex-lover, her depression, etc. The India section starts out the same way, and she gripes so much about meditation that it makes one wonder why she ever chose to spend four months in an Ashram. Don't expect to learn much about India, she hardly ever ventures outside the Ashram and the whole thing could take place in Arizona for all practical purposes. However, in this section she has some genuine spiritual experiences that eventually enable her to let go of the incessant whining. When she gets to Indonesia, she is finally able to get over herself and start paying attention to the places and people she encounters. This section was by far my favorite part. You get some idea of what it's like to live in Bali, you hear about some interesting characters, and there's some action to move the story forward. Yes, it's still mostly about Liz, but at least now she's happy and not whining anymore.<br /><br />I think the different reactions to the book stem from vastly different expectations. If you enjoy travel books and are expecting a travelogue, you'll be sorely disappointed. This is a book about Liz Gilbert; it's not about the places she's visiting. But if you're a person who has been through relationship troubles, you'll probably relate to her struggles to get her life back on track. And if you're a person on a spiritual path, you'll also relate to some of her experiences, and you might even find inspiration in her journey towards a balanced life.
0439023483|5.0|It is so weird how a book can make someone literally fall to the ground with such excitement or cry with emotions through a whole chapter. This book did wonders on me. Suzanne Collins is amazing. Her writing was perfect and her words just take you out of this world. Katniss and Peeta are great characters. It sometimes felt like you were in there, in the arena with them. Helping them survive and wishing they will make it out alive.   I heard they're going to be making a movie. I'm so excited, i just hope they don't change it around and ruin it.     I couldn't put the book down. I recommend it to anyone.

B002RCEBBI|5.0|I have all of Epica's CD's and this one is just as good as the others! The lyrics are about a lot of things I don't really understand or necessarily agree with, but it's nice to hear some music where the band is playing/singing about topics they're actually passionate about. After all- music is about expressing yourself! Mark Jansen's writing is exquisite- absolutely brilliant! I love how many of the songs start off one way then turn into something you'd never expect. Simone's voice sounds amazing in every track... BUY THIS CD!!! Even if you don't like metal, believe me- there will be some element in this album that will suck you in and make you keep listening to the tracks over and over!
B001I1123O|1.0|All I can say is Dawkins clearly did not do any homework on this book. He simply launches into an angry diatriabe against religion. His arguments are old and not very persuasive, and have been ably addressed a hundred times over.<br /><br />If he intends the book to be read by a sympathetic audience that's as unschooled in philosophy and theology as he appears to be, he's fine. Otherwise, it should be an embarrassment to him. He should stick to writing about science/biology matters.
B002NUULNG|5.0|I can see the problems the other reviewers have written about, and I can't argue that the new CGI doesn't match the look of the old film. I got this BluRay because I love the movie, and just wanted to see it (not expecting much). But I got to tell you, I had a blast watching it. The new (or redone might be more accurate) opening scene is amazing. Even though the new visuals might not match, they are a welcome addition. It doesn't replace the original version (which is included on the disk, standard format, under special features. Note: It is not listed on cover), but it is really well done.     Most impressive, is the new 6.1 mix. They have completely re-done the sound mix, re did sound effects, and remixed levels and speaker placement. It sounds amazing. One of the best sound mixes I have ever heard on Bluray. Actually, looking for a stronger word than amazing, but can't think of the proper adjective. If you are a audiophile, this reason alone is enough to buy it. You will not be disappointed.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|Hands down a rock-n-roll milestone record. Four lads from Liverpool, England walk into Abbey Road Studios on Monday morning February 11, 1963 to start work in Studio 2 at 10:00 AM. By 10:45 PM that evening all the songs on Please Please Me are recorded!! Seems simple enough but couple that with the fact that John Lennon had symptoms of the flu that day and could only give one vocal performance for Twist And Shout before his voice would be completely gone. Thankfully it was the last song of the days work in Studio 2. You can literally hear John's voice shredding. There would be no second take for Twist And Shout. A stunning rock vocal performance ranking high in the tops of all time on record. From the opening track's energetic 1-2-3-4 (Paul's count into I Saw Her Standing There) you get the feeling there is truly something magical happening. There was so much raw energy packed into those 14 hours that day in Studio 2 with each track being cut live on the spot. It is as close to the live sound as we would get to The Beatles until their final album Let It Be nearly 7 years later (save for a few reasonable sounding bootleg recordings). Please, Please Me is remarkable in that sense you feel as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo are after something from their very own hearts. They desired to make this one count in every way. This would be the same group that would only 3 years later record Revolver!! Who would've known that that very day in Abbey Road Studio 2? From that day they never looked back and began a wonderful musical recording odyssey unmatched in sheer out-put. Please, Please Me is where the party started and it is remarkably timeless in that sense. Brilliant!!
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Michelangelo Antonioni's \\"Blow-Up\\" features David Hemmings as the photographer. This film follows the photographer into a park where he takes photos of a couple embracing and playing. It is later when he develops the photos that he finds out that he has evidence of a murder in the backgrounds of the photos.<br /><br />The movie is as much about the photgrapher in the film as it is about Antonioni, who is also the photographer of the movie. In the movie when Hemmings develops the photos he is trying to put together the reality of the scene, and he is trying to impose a narrative on the scene he has viewed just as the director himself through a sequence of scenes is creating a narrative. Can reality ever really make sense though? Here, the photographer is going over photo after photo in order to try and recreate the past moment that he witnessed. Interestingly enough while we are watching the scenes there is no sound or music except the haunting sounds we heard in the park of the leaves of the trees rustling in the wind. Through these sequences of shots a marvelous build up of drama is created as we speculate about what he is going to find. Eventually he does find a man in the woods holding a gun, and believes that he has prevented a murder. It is through a series of shots like these that Antonioni's genius for film making is conveyed. After blowing up a few more photos he finds a body and realizes that someone was killed after all.<br /><br />There is a scene that is important in the film that shows an artist in his studio who makes a comment that he often doesn't know what he has made until after the fact. And it is only after he has had some time to view the painting that some aspect of it begins to have meaning for him. It is at this point that he has then imposed meaning on the image. This could be said to be the way Antonioni works through his own work as a director. When the photographer goes back to the park to see if the body is there it is to verify the reality of what he has seen in the photos. After he sees the body in the park he then must find someone else in order to verify his view because reality only has meaning in a social context. But then when he goes back to his studio he finds that someone has stolen the photos, and so the evidence of the murder is gone. When he returns to the body in order to photograph the body it also is gone. Now he can't prove that there was a murder. The blown up photos look like one of Bill's abstract paintings where there was no meaning until the artist imposed one on the image, just as Hemming's character too has imposed meaning on the photos he has taken. By blowing up the photos it is as if he has revealed layers under layers to find meaning, but has he found any meaning if he can't now prove it to anyone else? Vanessa Redgrave's character appears again and then disappears. Constantly we are led through this labyrinth where the truth remains elusive. Meaning is shown as only having meaning if it is in a social context as meaning is a social construction. Hemming is never able to verify his reality since he can never get anyone to see the corpse.<br /><br />In the last scene, with the mimes, we have a group of people participating in the illusion of a tennis game which the photographer witnesses. We are shown that the imaginary tennis game has meaning because this group of mimes buy into this reality. Eventually Hemming's character also buys into this reality as he goes to retrieve the imaginary ball that was hit over the fence. Even the camera buys into this reality as it too follows the flight of the imaginary ball which flies over the fence and rolls over the grass. Ultimately Hemming's character disappears which seems to reaffirm that this is the director's reality that he has created.<br />Blow-Up is about these layers of meaning that are constantly being pealed away as if there is no true reality that can be seen since reality is constantly shifting depending on the contextor point of view.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I knew from the beginning that this was going to be basically another Greatest Hits collection, but I had to get it for the simple fact that it's Michael. However, I am not disappointed with this album. I absolutely LOVE the 36 page booklet that comes with it and features pictures from his rehearsals. I also love the title track, This is It. I can listen to it over and over again.
0156027321|5.0|I listened to this book on CD and found it to be very well done. The book is broken up into three parts. The first section focuses on the life of a boy named Pi Patel and his life as the son of a zoo owner in Pondicherry, India. Much of the book discusses philosophy, religion, and zoology. Interestingly, Pi follows Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam much to his parents and respective religious leaders' bewilderment.<br /><br />As the first section ends and the 2nd begins, his parents sell the animals of the zoo and make plans to move to Canada. Their journey across the Pacific begins aboard a ship that also includes the zoo animals. After a short time at sea, the ship sinks and Pi finds himself in a lifeboat with an assortment of animals such as a zebra, a hyena, a rat, some cockroaches, an orangutan, and a tiger. The assortment of animals fight it out in sequential battles until finally only the tiger and Pi are left. Pi proceeds to live with the tiger on the life raft and uses his knowledge of animals gained from growing up around the zoo to survive. He learns to fish, and make fresh water with distillers and has a tenuous mutual existence with the tiger in which he actually provides food and water to it and manages to stay alive. The elements, hunger, thirst, and lack of sleep are constant companions and result in a very difficult existence for him. After roughly 7 months at sea, he lands in Mexico and is rescued.<br /><br />In the third section, we learn a second version of the sinking of the ship and his subsequent journey across the ocean through an interview of Pi by some men from Japan.<br /><br />The first section can be a bit tedious at times but provides good context for the second and third. Good explanation of various animals and zoological information is provided as well as a relatively good overview of 3 major world religions.<br /><br />The second section is outstanding and causes one to get involved with Pi and his travails hoping for him to make it through. On more than one occasion, I found myself sitting in the car after arriving at a destination to listen to a little bit more of the story.<br /><br />The third section is very short and gives a bit of a change in direction from where the reader expects it to go. After getting to the end, I was interested in re-reading it to pick up on symbolism throughout the book.<br /><br />One element of the book that can throw one off is the use of two narrators, an \\"author\\", and then Pi himself. An unnamed author, not Martel, is an actual character/narrator for some of the chapters. I'm not certain why Martel chose to use this style as it seemed a bit of a distraction rather than adding significantly to the story.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it as an unusual but fascinating story.on, I found myself sitting in the car after arriving at a destination to listen to a little bit more of the story.

B000OVLINI|2.0|Too many useless twists and convenient connections between charactors. Too many pregnant teenage girls with enraged fathers. Too much pointless secrecy between people who claim to be seeking the same end when a little information sharing would have cleared things right up.  And too much rain.  Apparently the rain in Spain falls constantly.
0385532458|5.0|John Grisham is a storyteller.  For all the flack he takes for being a \\"pop\\" author, this man knows how to tell a tale.  The only thing this book was missing was a rocking chair and a porch.  These are stories that might have been told on a lazy Sunday evening while sitting on grandpa's lap listening to the cicadas playing a tune composed by Mother Nature.  These stories run the gambit from touching, to sinister, to the unthinkable, to heart-wrenching to, \\"yep that's what you get\\", to my favorite... the \\"illegal yes, but I'll bet it felt so good\\"!<br />Until Grisham's `Playing for Pizza', I avoided his non-lawyer novels.  Well, I ended up enjoying that one and I really enjoyed this one.  Like I said earlier, John is a mesmerizing storyteller and, although these stories are not related in any way, they flow like they are.<br /><br />My favorite story, by FAR, was `Fish Files'.  (Think of the movie `Falling Down' without the violence and caffeine).  Maybe it's because I wish for this sort of thing to happen to me or maybe because I love living vicariously through a story.  Whatever the reason, I really enjoyed reading about Mack because he didn't hesitate when opportunity kicked down his door. Be a good man... bah!  Sticking with good southern values... whatever!  Doing what your Sunday school teacher said... yeah ummm... I think I'll pass.  I simply loved this story!!<br /><br />`Casino' came a very, very close second.  Each one of these seven stories creates a different feeling, gives birth to a unique memory, speaks to hidden emotions, and, in a small way, enriches the human spirit.  His pop success made him famous, but it's his ability to grab and never let go that makes his books unforgettable.  As a book lover/fanatic, I really enjoy authors' who have that ZING it takes to grab my attention and that indescribable POW that keeps me reading.  This is a wonderful, classic, short story collection.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|After seeing this movie I felt the need to write this review and defend it from the horrible reviews critics gave it. Is the movie predictable? Yes? Is it far fetched? Yes. Has it been done before? Yes? But is it charming? Yes it is. Is it funny? Yes it is.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who watches a romantic comedy and rolls their eyes thinking \\"This is so predictable\\" then you shouldn't watch movies like this. For everyone else, this is a fun movie with some great characters. Sandra Bullock doesn't get enough credit for her acting abilities. She does a terrific job here. I would say it's her second best romantic comedy behind \\"While You Were Sleeping.\\" And Betty White is good in anything she does.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like romantic comedies, you will like this movie. If you don't, you wont.

B000B589JI|5.0|I don't smoke or own a Zippo lighter.  However,  I have been using lighter fluid for decades to clean my scissors and other tools.  Lighter fluid works great on getting off adhesive residue from anything, and it leaves no visible mark on paper.  Rather than carry around a big can of lighter fluid, I have been looking for something small and convenient to carry a small quantity of the fluid.  However, only glass or metal will prevent the lighter fluid from evaporating.  So when I saw this aluminum container it was exactly what I was looking for.  I have 3 of these now and besides lighter fluid, the other 2 contain rubbing alcohol, and nail polish remover; all solvents I use in my various crafting activities.
B002MRROKI|5.0|Gather round, kids, put away your diaries, log off Twitter for five minutes as I tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was this band who were so sickeningly heavy, so on point, so ridiculously furious and DARK, so in-your-face righteous that they shredded everything in sight. Including the bands that had the unfortunate opportunity to open for them, knowing there was no chance to come close. This album sorta introduces you to what they were capable of, especially the last third of it, where the songs get rampagingly ugly and downright MEAN, starting with a caustic version of \\"All Apologies\\", sounding nothing like any version you've heard before. The end of their short career may have shown an even darker side, incapable of even pulling it together long enough to really move, but this set is as close to their peak as you can get, a concert for the ages that is almost laughable when you look at the mind-numbingly BAD bands they played the same festival with, as shown on the inside cover (Charlatans? Curve? Buffalo Tom? The frickin' WONDER STUFF?) See, kids, even bands of their time couldn't hang. So you shouldn't feel all THAT embarrassed that My Chemical Romance, Vampire Weekend, and Deerhoof make noise that sounds like a blender by comparison.<br /><br />I know, it's rough. I'm getting all generational on you, and that's not fair. As if it wasn't bad enough that they decided to play \\"On A Plain\\", \\"Negative Creep\\" and \\"Been A Son\\" back-to-back-to-back, which is reason enough to buy twenty copies of this and give it to all your friends. If that doesn't convince you of the unfortunateness of your losing the genetic lottery and ending up only reading about this band, then let's rub it all the way in by playing the version of \\"Aneurysm\\" here, which basically destroys the version from \\"Muddy Banks Of the Wishkah\\", a version I used to think was the best Nirvana recorded moment, a great version which PALES in comparison to the one here, which could kill whole forests. I would also like to draw your attention to the version of \\"Stay Away\\", which I plan on playing 7,000 times in a row tonight as I run around my yard revving up a chainsaw. Or how about the version of \\"School\\", which you need to be screaming at the top of your lungs next Monday in Algebra as you throw furniture around your classrooms and frighten your overpaid, ignorant teachers out of their similarly unenlightened stupor. Some things never change.<br /><br />You can call me a snob for rubbing your collective noses in the fact that this band had no equal, and I was lucky enough to witness something like this for the brief moment it was around. But I'm not really a snob, because I have hope, someday, that at least ONE of you could rise up and at least make an EFFORT to sound this mighty, this completely insanely GOOD so we can all sit back in amazement. But I doubt it.also like to draw your attention to the version of \\"Stay Away\\", which I plan on playing 7,000 times in a row tonight as I run around my yard revving up a chainsaw.

B0029O08WA|2.0|Okay, so i'm just gonna go with this as the reason why i dont like this soundtrack........I dont much care for indie music nor do i completely understand it. I'm not opposed to it, i mean everyone has their preference of music. i think i will put together my own soundtrack for this movie. Everyone is saying well it supposed to be dark and depressing. well i none of these songs really evoked any emotion from me, except boredom.<br />I'm just wondering what changed from the twilight soundtrack to this one.....i realize new moon has a more depressing feel as a storyline, but why all indie music? the first soundtrack had some great straight up rock bands but there were some indie tracks as well, which i loved every song on taht album.<br />here i find it hard to even appreciate one track, i guess i'd go with meet me on the equinox as the only thing i can really listen to. granted i will continue to try to listen to this album in hopes it will grow on me.<br />I think choosing one set genre of music was a pretty poor choice of whoever put this album together. this could have been so much better than it was, i hope this music does not ruin the movie for me.
0060920084|3.0|I've always enjoyed Bill Bryson's writing before; \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" is one of my favorites of all time, and I've enjoyed the excerpts that I've read of \\"A Walk In The Woods\\", which I'll get around to finishing one of these days. So I was quite disappointed to find that I didn't really enjoy this book, especially because it's so hard to put my finger on exactly why; there are still fascinating tidbits of information thrown into the middle of more or less unrelated discussions, and he has the same facility for a clever turn of phrase that I've enjoyed elsewhere. And many of the things he says in this book could easily have come out of the mouth of Dave Barry, and if they had, I'd almost certainly have been rolling on the floor laughing; when Bryson says them, they come across as petty and snide rather than amusingly exaggerated. This, in spite of the fact that I can't put my finger on any particular difference in how they would word things. Granted, I was frequently reading excerpts to my wife because of a particularly amusing turn of phrase or interesting piece of trivia, but overall, I just found myself rather annoyed by this pretentious snob who had so little good to say about small-town America; this despite the fact that I am as big an elitist as the next well-educated city boy. I can't explain it, but somehow, the book just rang somewhat off-key. One specific I can name that explains a bit of my reaction is that Bryson seems to want things both ways; if a place is a popular destination, he complains about how touristy it is, but if it's off the beaten track, he complains about the lack of civilized amenities.

0385504225|1.0|I loved Da Vinci Code so of course I had to read Angels and Demons.  I knew it was an earlier book so I didn't expect it would be as good... and it wasn't - but it was still readable.  Finally Dan Brown has released a new book.  I was so looking forward to \\"Lost Symbol\\".  By now Brown should be hitting his stride and Symbol should have been his masterpiece.    Wow.    Total dreck.  A mumbo-jumbo of B movie plot, pseudo-science and quasi-religion.  If you took a few new age hippie manuals and a few pages from the bible and tossed them into a blender I'm sure it would be a more engrossing read.    Dan - based on Da Vinci Code I let you sucker me into reading Deception Point and Digital Fortress.  I struggled through Angels and Demons.  But never again.  You are a one hit wonder.  I'm done with you!
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I'm a big fan of the old G.I. Joe cartoons and comics and I was worried about this movie version when I first heard about it. While it is different in many ways than the source material it still has the true G.I. Joe spirit and attitude with an amazing amount of excellent vehicles, weapons and costumes! I watched it 3 times in the theaters because there's just so much to see in it. The characters are all likable and none are obnoxious (a welcome change from most Hollywood movies). The action flows fast and free and much of the choreography is jaw-dropping (especially the fight scenes with 'Snake Eyes' and the battle in Paris). Over time this movie will be considered an action classic.
0780626966|4.0|I love the dvds, and the box set was a lot cheaper then I imagined it would be.

B0000025ED|5.0|Can't say that I love every one of Billy Joel's albums mainly because I've never heard them all. This is something that I remember,along with Heatwave's [[ASIN:B0012GMX8I Central Heating]] that I remember listening to a lot as a child on 8-track at our summer camp. Hearing it now for the first time as an adult I am amazed how much my opinion of it has broadened and increased,not that I had a bad one in the first place. That comes from again having only heard a few of his albums and knowing him otherwise from his hits. During the late 70's the world of pop music was changing. Jazz and R&B were ascendant and,for those who were not interested in making disco or heartland rock style records those styles and the pop/rock of the day were beginning to bleed together and it turned out to be a wonderful combination. You could see that quality in records that explored that hybrid from Steely Dan's [[ASIN:B00003002C Aja]],Gino Vannelli's [[ASIN:B000002GAF Brother to Brother]] and The Doobie Brothers' [[ASIN:B000002KGX Livin' on the Fault Line]]. This album is part of that same flow and,lucky for Billy Joel his sometimes over-reaching musical ambitions and edgy New York attitude really worked to great affect here. Even though the content of [[ASIN:B00000DCHC The Stranger]] was uniformily consistant it did have something of the feeling of a hit parade. At the same time the jazzy funk elements that permeate this album were creeping in even there and opened the door. Even the two big singles here \\"Big Shot\\" and \\"My Life\\" both have strong pop-jazz flavors in the production. \\"Zanzibar\\",featuring a jazz rhythm section in the arrangment featuring a solo by Freddie Hubbard allows Billy to stretch this musical concept out as far as he can take it with one of the best chorded hooks of his catalog next to perhaps \\"Movin' Out\\". On \\"Stiletto\\" and \\"Rosalinda's Eyes\\" the fusion flavor take presidents as the theme of girl watching comes up in various turns,twice. \\"Half A Mile Away\\" and \\"Until The Night\\" are the more pop/rocky of the tunes presented here but pop/rock with a very strong street funk flavor and also extend on the hopefully obvious Elton John influence in Billy's style. The album is rounded out by the swinging title tune and \\"Honesty\\",another of Billy's great ballads he seemed to do so well. Considering that jazz and funk on pop/rock albums can easily end up being gimmicky seeming genre exercises the fact that Billy chose to integrate those musical elements into his own sound is a sign that his often overbearing ambition,which often led to much criticism against his music,could take him to really good places.\\"Half A Mile Away\\" and \\"Until The Night\\" are the more pop/rocky of the tunes presented here but pop/rock with a very strong street funk flavor and also extend on the hopefully obvious Elton John influence in Billy's style.

B00129H7VS|5.0|The movie is awesome, but the shipping through Amazon is less than desirable. The first collector tin we received was dented in several locations, so we exchanged it for another one...the second one we received was even worse than the first. Multiple scratches, and numerous large dents.  When Amazon was contacted, they told us they didn't want to send out another one, we should just return the 2nd one we received. If this was an individual that we had bought this from, their rating would be poor if all the items they sent were damaged like this (it was supposedly a brand new DVD we purchased). It's sad that Amazon can get by with it. I'm truly disappointed. I've never had bad luck like this when I purchased items from Amazon through an individual/business.
0553293397|5.0|I absolutely love this book. The mystery was a good one, but the moral of the story was far bigger then the story itself. I have read the foundation series and I love the way this book tied into the foundation series (specially to the last foundation book) I have ready many a mythological, fantasy books and Asimov has to be one of the great minds of all time.

B002JTHFUS|5.0|I have waited 26 years for a good sounding release (not that the original was bad, it just could have been much better, but technology at the time wasn't up to par) and here it is. I can't say anything different then has already been written, other then if you are a fan of old U2, then you have to have this, it's a must. This recording meant so much to me at that point in my life, and all these years later it still hits me right in the heart, unbelievable.
0307266303|5.0|In Born to Run, Christopher McDougall spins a wildly careening tale of colorful personas, from hidden tribes to research scientists, penniless college coeds to bizarre millionaires, shameless promoters to reclusive loners. From the plains of Africa to the mountains of Colorado, from Death Valley to the Sierra Madre, he weaves one common thread that binds them all: the love of running.<br /><br />McDougall, an editor for the magazine Men's Health, had to stop his recreational running due to foot pain. That pain triggered a bizarre cascade of events that culminated in a secret grueling ultra-marathon in the remote mountains of Mexico that included some of the best runners on the planet. Born to Run is his travelogue of those events.<br /><br />Each chapter whips and turns like an out of control roller-coaster carrying you on a wild ride where you never know what's around the next bend. Along the way, McDougall explores the body and soul of the runner, visiting bio-mechanics, evolutionary anthropology, philosophy, nutrition, and more.<br /><br />I tremendously enjoyed this book on several levels. One, the story itself was a trip, living through all the people and places that culminated in this amazing race. Second, the dips into science were fascinating to me: how uniquely engineered the human body is to run down to the placement of specific ligaments. But most intriguing was the explorations on the spiritual aspect of running, how nourishing running is to the human spirit and how closely tied it can be to our capacity to love.<br /><br />Born to Run is fascinating reading for anyone with a taste for adventure and a love of running. I had a blast reading it.
B002MTTZ5I|3.0|The opening riff shows these guys mean business, great guitar runs, good rhythm section and decent to good vocals.  Where \\"bands\\" such as Bad News and Spinal Tap made fun of the music scene of the music they were playing, this truly crosses the line.  Did I laugh at the songs???  You bet.  The lyrics though, man way too crude and obscene.  Misogynistic to the max making this impossible to get any airplay and unfortunately, not many repeat listens.  This might appeal to 13 year old boys for repeat listens because of the language but unfortunately there is nothing clever about the lyrics.  Funny yet sad.  Swearing loudly always gets the attention but repeating the same words doesn't keep it.  This is worth checking out for a few listens but you will sell or trade it away fairly soon.  We won't hear much from these guys again because the joke wears thin.  Enjoy the ride while it lasts.  Andrew \\"Dice\\" who?

0385495323|5.0|This book is about cryptology (a term that includes both code making or cryptography and code breaking or cryptanalysis). However, the primary focus is not the science of cryptology or its history although both are covered in sufficient detail. It is, rather, on people; the people who made the codes, the people who broke the codes and the people whose lives were affected by the codes. The book proceeds in a chronological manner as it follows the age old war between code makers and code breakers from the distant past to well into the future.     Singh explains the not-so-easy mathematics and technology behind code making and breaking in a vivid and very accessible style. Elusive topics such as the operation of the Enigma, the mathematics of RSA and the principals of quantum cryptology are so well explained that most readers will grasp them with a single reading. It is hard not to be inspired by this book. Many times you will find yourselves grabbing a sheet of papers and attempting to work out the codes yourself. The book provides a set of ciphers to work on your own and a list of further reading for those interested to follow up on Alice, Bob and Eve (hypothetical characters used to explain techniques in cryptology).    \\"Uijt jb b gjof cppl\\" replace each letter by the one that precedes it in the alphabet and you get \\"This is a fine book\\". This simple cipher, called the Cesar shift cipher, is one of the earliest known ciphers and is discussed in the first chapter which covers cryptology from ancient Greece until the fourteenth century and narrates the gripping tale of Mary Queen of the Scots. The second chapter covers the evolution of both cryptology and cryptanalysis until the 20th century and narrates, among others, the mysterious tale of Beale's ciphers. The third and fourth chapters cover the evolution of cryptology during the first and second world wars and mainly concentrate on the operation and the cracking of the famous German Enigma machine. The fifth chapter covers the Navajo code talkers used by the US in WW2 as well as the inspiring tales of decipherment of Hieroglyphics mainly by Champollion and of Linear B by, among others, Michael Ventris. Chapters six and seven are about Modern Cryptology. They covers the story behind the ground breaking advancements in cryptography, e.g. public key cryptography, that fueled internet communication and commerce. It also ponders in some detail over the issue of privacy versus security. Chapter eight is about the future of Cryptology and how both code makers and code breakers are starting to make use of Quantum mechanics to take cryptology to a whole new level.    As mentioned earlier, this book is about people and it does a good job in paying tribute to many of the usually unsung heroes of cryptology.     All said, this is one of the most gripping, amusing and rewarding general science books; it even has instructions on how to hide a message within a hardboiled egg!!
B002BFIN6K|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  It gave me a new-found appreciation for Rachmaninoff's music.  Etude Tableau, Op. 33, No. 2 in C Major is a wonderful display of his talent and power behind a piano, and Prelude, Op. 3, No. 2 in C-Sharp Minor is an amazing example of how he can tell such a detailed story with no words and 88 keys. I could not stop listening to it.  Zenph is doing things I could never have imagined, and anxiously await their next album. A must buy for any classic music listener!    Henry M.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|i loved this film im sooooo glad that i rented it. it had twist and turns it had a good story line. what i liked about this film is that you didnt know what was going to happen next and when something scary happend you just jumped up out of your sit. and my fav part was when they started to fine out where she came from and when they fine out where she came from she wasnt really a orphan there. so if you wont a GOOD move to see and you dont know which one you wont YOU HAVE TO GET THE ORPHAN...best move EVER.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|When you're Slayer, you don't apologize.  You don't have to.  No matter who the original \\"Big Four\\" were in thrash metal history, only Slayer have consistently delivered, not succumbing to rap, alternative or Top 40 formulaics, as have Anthrax, Metallica and Megadeth, in that order.  Simply put, Slayer are far superior to the other three in total output, Metallica only providing real competition through \\"Master of Puppets\\", and then sinking downhill creatively in a hurry, although becoming FM darlings in the process and losing what credibility they had fought so hard to achieve.<br />  Slayer have delivered a slab of modern-era thrash with \\"World Painted Blood\\", that is as angry and innovative as their \\"Unholy Trinity\\" series, and could easily snuggle up against \\"South Of Heaven\\" as a companion piece without being a ripoff.  Some fans became jaded as the band released somewhat weaker CD's (although not in my opinion) like \\"Divine Intervention\\" or \\"Diabolus in Musica\\", but they can rejoice as these hellions are back in full fire and brimstone glory.  Few bands get it right every time, but Slayer has never disappointed.  My \\"Big Four\\" bands?  Slayer, Kreator, Exodus and Meshuggah.  No lightweights or sellouts here.

They are kick-ass and their music simply grows on you. Seriously, I didn't give it much of a chance so when it came out I would have given it a 3/4 stars but now I simply can't get enough. I went and saw them again in August. Great music. Buy it and give it a chance. Look what most of the reviews are...five stars. The majority give it five for a reason!

1401323820|5.0|I'm a hard person to please when it comes to mystery books. Janet Evanovich disappoints, James Patterson makes me happy most of the time but even there I can find some faults.    I found ABC's Castle to be a breath of fresh air, we are being chocked to death but the forensics procedures. CSI and it's spin offs, Bones, Criminals Mind, Numbers need I go on? So an old fashioned detective drama with a large does of humor is exactly what viewers needed. It is witty, charming, entertaining and has Nathan Fillion, what more do you need?    Heat Wave apparently, as I said I'm hard to please when it comes to my detective novels so when I say that this is an excellent novel I mean it! It is as funny as the show with very similar characters but with enough differences that it seems just like something Richard Castle would write without actually naming the main characters Richard and Kate.    The case itself is FABULOUS! I can usually predict the killer in most procedurals and novels but I have to admit about halfway through the novel I just gave up trying to figure it out and just let myself be surprised. A great deal of fun is in these pages, amazing one liners, fun characters, with a serious side that stands out much more against all of the humor. Fans of the show will see parts of their favorite episodes within the book as well, again as if the real Richard Castle was drawing from his own experiences. People who have never seen the show will not be lost as everthing is explained within the book, however you might just find out a fun way to spend your Monday Nights (Castle comes on at 10pm eastern on ABC for those who wanted to know)    All in all an excellent read and may I say a great idea to tie into the show.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I have been carefully following the scientific literature on 'Global Warming' since the early 80's, when a prominent speaker at a Chemistry Department colloquium proposed that we needed to burn all the fossil fuels we can to stave off the impending ice age. So I am familiar with the science in this area, and was stunned when I watched this movie to see so many apparently deliberate misrepresentations of the data.<br /><br />In retrospect, I have concluded that I should not blame Gore for making so many scientific and statistical errors in his movie. After all, he is passionate about this issue, he is not a scientist, and the movie accurately portrays his passion for this topic. Thus, seen as a documentary about him, it is pretty good. Evaluated from a scientific perspective, however, it reeks.<br /><br />At the AAAS meeting in Chicago last year, Gore confirmed my suspicions. He said, speaking to an overflow crowd of scientists from around the world, \\"I don't understand most of what the scientists give me, I just repeat it.\\" You could hear audible gasps throughout the audience.<br /><br />So much of the science in this movie has already been reviewed and/or invalidated by the scientific community that I need not mention it here. However, it is worthy of mention that even when the movie first came out, the 2007 review of it in Science included the comment:<br /><br />\\"Gore leaves the viewer with the mistaken impression that CO2 is the driver of climate change in that historic record.\\"<br /><br />Enough said.<br /><br />My purpose for writing is to report the success I've had using the movie in my science classes as negative examples of statistical fallacies. Nearly EVERY slide has a GLARING statistical error in it. It is remarkable really, if not pitiful. One almost wonders if it were deliberate. What I think is going on is that Gore is trying to make the message as compelling as he can to the audience that doesn't look too closely.<br /><br />There are several examples of mixing data sets, cherry-picking data, exaggerated or incomplete scales, correlation vs. causation, anecdotal data, using real dollars instead of inflation adjusted dollars...the list goes on and on. A literal grab-bag of illustrations.<br /><br />Now that I've had a few years to calm down, and Gore has essentially admitted his ignorance, I'm glad this movie was produced, as it documents the disaster that can happen when politics tries to employ science to its own ends.or incomplete scales, correlation vs. causation, anecdotal data, using real dollars instead of inflation adjusted dollars...the list goes on and on.

076531178X|5.0|A definite 5-star effort, THE FINAL EMPIRE begins the Mistborn Trilogy and launches the talented Brandon Sanderson up into my 'favorite authors' list.  Where his first novel, [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]], was entertaining and a worthwhile read, this book really outshines that first effort and will ensure that I check out future work by Sanderson.  With well-described settings, a unique system of magic, realistic and likeable characters, a smoothly progressing plot, and absolutely top-notch action scenes, there is very little to not like about this book.  It should please any fan of good fiction, particularly those with an appreciation for dark and heroic fantasies.<br /><br />To me, the primary attraction of the fantasy genre is the absence of limitations on the author.  When the imagination is freed from the limits placed on 'real world' fiction (or even classical fantasy worlds, ie. Tolkein), and authors are able to make their story on a completely clean slate, without the rules of geography, physics, or history boxing them in, you can really get the most unique and wonderful stories.  In this book, Brandon Sanderson takes full advantage of this and demonstrates just how well his imagination works.  The setting of the Mistborn Trilogy presents a dark and oppressive world of ash and mist where the vast majority of people struggle as slaves under the brutality of the few.  A place where hope is fleeting and resistance is futile.  And a place whose history is muddled and future seems bleak.  Throw in the fully unique system of magic known as Allomancy and you're halfway there to an excellent story.  This magic system is one of my favorite aspects of this trilogy, being well characterized as far as how it works and (most importantly) being very limited as to its utility.  This isn't some vague and all-powerful magic that the hero only need master in order to save the world.  While powerful, and providing for awesome fight scenes and many possibilities, this magic certainly has its limitations.  I would go as far as saying that this is the most well-defined system of magic of any fantasy series I've read.<br /><br />Also, the story itself is excellent.  Driven by a compelling group of nicely fleshed-out characters, this is a heroic fantasy tale that you won't soon forget.  Vin and Co. each have their own specific roles and unique characteristics and mannerisms that stay true through the story and makes each both knowable and likeable.  While the little man's fight against the unstoppable evil lord has been done before, these characters' fight against the Lord Ruler presents an exiting and unpredictable story with ups and downs, successes and failures, and a good variety of unique situations.  From infiltrations of the elite on ballroom dance floors to flying midnight fights with monster-like and unstoppable adversaries, this story of a band of thieves trying to take down an empire is a must read.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has completely impressed with this first book in the Mistborn Trilogy, and I can't wait to read [[ASIN:0765356139 The Well of Ascension]].<br /><br />One additional note, if you're a fan of cover art, go with the original hardcover edition of these books.

B0000DYKET|5.0|This is basically the Keen Newport H2 sandal with the nylon straps but done in suede leather. Next to the H2's, this is my favorite sandal and the H2's possibly my favorite shoe ever. I slightly prefer the nylon to the suede since my Keens get heavy use and when they get dirty, you can just hose off the nylon ones and they're clean again. No fuss, no muss. But the suede ones are a little dressier and they look a bit nicer.<br /><br />These Keen sandals are just worlds ahead of the competition. The protective rubber toe is very practical, and the adaptive and supportive sole (Keens were designed by a doctor who studied the foot to design them) is the most comfortable I've ever tried in a sandal, and probably in any shoe. Plus the Keen toe area is wide enough for my triple EEE foot. I'm not a super wide foot, but my feet are wide enough so that many of the other commercial shoes on the market rub just enough to be irritating, and the Keens don't do that.<br /><br />The Keens have an extra thick heel which provides more arch support, too. Unlike other sandals which tend to have a flat sole that doesn't provide any support, these are more like regular shoes with arch support and a raised heel.<br /><br />I wear these almost every day, even in winter, when I just wear warmer socks they're so comfortable. Every time they go on sale at REI for 20% off or so, I buy several more pairs just to make sure I have enough for the next ten years. I'm assuming that in ten years either Keen or someone else will make a better sandal, but I'm not even sure about that these are so good. If they ever do stop making these and I can't find anything as good, I know I'm going to be kicking myself that I didn't buy 20 year's worth.<br /><br />Last but not least, they wear well and since I started buying them two years ago I've only worn out one pair. Overall just a great sandal and a great shoe and you can see from the other reviews here that I'm not the only one who raves about them.
1594488878|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much.  My recommendation is don't bother with my review just go get the book so your reading pleasure can begin as soon as possible.    Annie, Duncan, and Tucker have reached middle-age and are stuck in lives that have not, in their own opinions, been well lived.  Regrets abound and all are seeking a way out of their own misery and confusion.  Unbeknownst to them their lives are all about to collide.  Their regrets couldn't be more opposite.  Tucker has littered his life with ex-wives and children he has not done well by while Annie and Duncan have cohabited lazily for 15 years without committing to either marriage or children.  With those conflicts laid out clearly Hornby proceeds to tell their individual stories with a tenderness and poignancy that illuminates the human condition.  These three people come so alive and are handled with such a masterful touch that I enjoyed every single word of dialogue, description, and detailed insecurity.  This book will make you laugh, it might even make you cry a little, but it cannot help but make you think about life and relationships and how each of our actions affect those around us every day.    Well done, Sir, very well done.
0882709194|5.0|It about time some for the scientific community to admit that Darwin's ideas are rooted in racial and sexist bigotry. His whole premise seems to be an explanation for why we do not have to love others... if we can find a way to believe that they are not as human as us. This fits in perfectly with the mid 18th century thinking that blacks and women are inferior to white men. Hitler and Darwin were partners.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|I know there are already a bunch of reviews on this album, but this album is so good that I just wanted to add one more. Breaking Benjamin is not a creative, ground breaking band by any means; but we all know this - we love them for what they are - masters of the hard rock genre. Everything they do - this album especially - is simply amazing hard rock / nu metal / whatever you want to call it. Burnley's vocals are unmatched by any in this genre, and the band is so amazingly tight that every moment of every song is impressive.    If you are wondering, stop wondering - this is an amazing album.  Thanks again Breaking Benjamin for filling that empty hard rock space that only you can fill... a lot of this indie and alt rock crap just doesn't cut it.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Everyone wants a friend. In Dexter's case its not that different. Considering all the things that are going on in his life - his brother (Season 1), the Bay Harbor Buther (Season 2), and the things that happened between himself and Rita (Paul, Lila, the changes in rita's characters, and other surpises) its only normal to want someone to share with. But to share your firend with your dark passenger, explainign things that stay better by darkness - that can be a problem.<br /><br />As far as Dexter goes, I have to say that it has remained one of my favorite shows on television. There have been so many plots that have surprised me, from the things with the Ice Truck Killer to the way that Dexter slipped the noose in Season 2, and things continue to grow from here. Now we have Dexter attempting to make sense of his life as Rita grows, thinking about what a family is and how it could fit into his world. Rita has undergone changes as well (I've foudn some of those bad, but that is totally an opinon of my own), as have so many of the characters that Dexter calls \\"friends.\\" Of course, these firends are just cover and Dexter mixes it up with somoen that promises him more than that. The development of this story, coupled with the already great stroytelling that Dexter brings to the scrceen, is amazingly fresh. The acting is superb, too, with everyone from the sister that still feels the torment of rejection to the drinking frinds and lab partners that have storylines all their own. In many ways this sets the show apart because, unlike other series, it does not ignore the things that happen to the people around Dexter. It merges them and changes them, making waves that sometimes help and sometimes threaten.<br /><br />I personally give the show my highest seal of approval, noting just how fast I went throught the seasons on DVD. They are addictive things, and they are not horrific like they could be. Bloody - yes, horric - not so much. Even people in my family that can't stomach some CSI episodes watch the show with passion. As I write this I have already entered the fourth season as well, with even the newest addition to the force (one Quinn for a likeable Dokes)making this reviewer happy. Sometimes I feel like I have Dexter fever, even wanting a \\"bowl till you Bleed\\" team shirt.<br />It truly makes you love it in ways you wouldn't have thought possible.odes watch the show with passion.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The included Mac application that plays the documentary video (and maybe does other things; I don't know) is a PPC application (not universal binary). So if you have an Intel mac, you'll be prompted to install Rosetta (code translator) if you haven't already. It's pretty easy. However, I don't want Rosetta on my machine and it seems like a pretty major oversight that the application included on this CD is not a universal binary. Macs have been running on intel processors for years now.    HOWEVER, if you browse the directory structure, you'll find Quicktime files. One is the documentary, the other the credits (which are almost as long!). I was able to open the quicktime file, and (under Snow Leopard/QuickTime X) I was able to 'share to iTunes' and then sync it to my iPod. The same can probably be done under Quicktime 7/Leopard if you have QuickTime Pro. So, it's a little trouble, but it is possible to get both the music and the documentary on an iPod. I don't know if there's other content in the application that I'm missing...but I'm happy to have gotten this far.    And...the remastering sounds incredible. It's subtle but completely breathtaking at the same time. If you like/love this album, the remastered version is a must-have.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|In the search for wonder weapons, the Nazis allowed themselves to listen to a certain man by the name of Rasputin. Many people would know him as \\"the mad monk\\" or other terms, but the Nazis only saw a way t make a quick buck. I wish the movie could have brought about how he survived his fall better, how the seven didn't just have the power but there was also a certain witch named Baba Yaga that had quite the way with this world, but movies can only do so much. This movie did quite a bit, too, taking many of the things fromt he first ansd second graphic novel and giving them to an audience that wants. Mignola said that the answers he gave here made him feel a little bad, too, so the graphic novel readers were rewarded by getting explanations they may have otherwise found themselves without. In my world, that's a win-win on both fronts.<br /><br />As far as the movie fgoes, it had a little bit of everything. There were the fables that mixed with the Hellboy flavor, introducing Nazis that readers would recognize but adding them with a twist. Seeing these things move on the screen was beautiful, too, because i really didn't expect so much from Hellboy going into the primetime. Still, add a great director, imput from the writer, and Ron P. (the only person i can see being Hellboy) and you have yourself a set-up. Then add in other things like the CGi that blended in beautifully, Chtulu-spawned beasts that were shout outs by both director and writer, and you have yourself a great story. It has pieces that make it a little bit of eveything, too, from the coedy styling of a joke here or a beast there and you have youself something that shines on the screen.<br />In the beginning I had my reservations, too, but the end product made me a happy camper.<br /><br />For fans of the series, this is a great thing. From people who do not know anything about the series, it is something grerat with a title that echoes the Pulp comic days of yore. There are all sorts of things that are good to have here, garnering high priase from someone that has followed ( and reviewed) almost everything that has Hellboy in its pages. And I loved what was made here, much to my surprise.<br />Heavily recommended.arnering high priase from someone that has followed ( and reviewed) almost everything that has Hellboy in its pages.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is one of the funniest sitcoms to come around in along time.  I absolutely recomend any fans of the show to buy this as well as anyone who may not have seen the show. The writing is very funny and the actors have great chemistry and impecable timing and play off each othet very well. this show just cracks me up each week and I'll cherish these DVD's for a long time and watch over and over again. GREAT BUY.
B0008ENIAC|4.0|Best known for bringing Joan Crawford to an Oscar win, `Mildred Pierce' is a nice slice of contemporary crime noir heaven complete with slick performances, witty dialog and subtle yet engaging direction.  It pretty much has everything that one could ask for from a film of this genre, despite the fact that it pretty short of believable.  It's beyond entertaining and certainly one of the more satisfying films of the 40's.<br /><br />The film opens with a gunshot and a dead body and a murder investigation that leads to quite a discovery.<br /><br />Crawford plays Mildred, a devoted mother of two who throws out her prideful husband Bert and slums it as a waitress in order to provide for her doting daughter Kay and her spoiled brat of a daughter Veda.  She eventually makes good on her savvy business sense and unwavering determination and opens a chain of successful restaurants that launch her into wealth; wealth that her daughter and new husband Monte are all to eager to squander.<br /><br />Crawford is serviceable as Mildred, although I must say that I found her to be the films weakest link, performance wise.  She doesn't do anything wrong, but she also doesn't do anything remarkable here either.  I have yet to find Crawford stunning, but supposedly she was so I guess I have more to watch from her.  I don't understand the Oscar win, but I'm not mad at it.  Jack Carson was perhaps my favorite performance here.  He really understood the style of the 40's film noir, and his enthusiastic and often suggestive delivery really complimented the direction of the film.  He just captured my attention from beginning to end.  Eve Arden has a few scenes, but she uses them to the full; chewing scenery left and right with a solid mix of wit and charm.  Zachary Scott is full of seductive charms, but he also brushes each frame with that snooty presence that screams \\"SCOUNDREL\\".<br /><br />Ann Blyth is a revelation as Veda.  She completely makes a character that I absolutely loathe someone I desired to see in every scene.  Veda will probably go down for me as one of the most unlikable and despise-worthy characters in the history of cinema and yet she was utterly delicious thanks to Blyth.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I wanted to ring her neck, I couldn't help but smile every time she walked into view.<br /><br />I wished that the script had been fleshed out a little more, for there is a very large story to tell here and it isn't told (at times) in the best way.  It can feel rather rushed in areas as we jet across Mildred's life in large chunks.  I am intrigued that they are turning this into a television mini-series (with the beloved Kate Winslet no less) and really feel that taking their time and expanding on this film will really create something wonderful, for there is so much here that is merely touched upon that will make for scrumptious viewing.<br /><br />With style, grace and edge, `Mildred Pierce' is most definitely a film I'd recommend to anyone wanting a nice taste of the 40's.ene.

0061703257|3.0|Dennis Lehane is one of my favorite writers, and as an aspiring writer myself, I have tremendous respect for his craft.  That said, this book deserves a mixed review.  On the positive side, the concept and and set-up of the story are very compelling, if somewhat contrived.  Lehane does an excellent job of creating a foreboding atmosphere, at least at the beginning of the book.  He also does a good job of portraying Teddy, the main character, as a man whose struggle to live with his own psychological wounds proves far more daunting than any challenge presented by his adversaries.  Thus Lehane moves the novel from ordinary crime/cop drama into the realm of complex psychological thriller.  Despite the complexity, and contrary to the criticisms of some other reviewers, I do feel Lehane meticulously plotted this book so that all the strands hang together in a cohesive whole.  To the extent there are some loose ends, the conclusion either resolves, explains, or obviates them.  On the negative side, Teddy somehow fails to gel into much more than a vessel for his internal conflicts.  He remains a collection of traits, attitudes, and back story, rather than a fully-formed character.  I'm not sure how that happened, since the story is told almost exclusively from Teddy's point of view by a third-person omniscient narrator.  In any event, I never became fully invested in Teddy, and therefore found the conclusion less shattering than others apparently did.  ***SPOILER FOLLOWS***<br />The ending is not original--we learn that Teddy isn't who we thought he was, so we can't trust what we saw through his eyes--but I did find the final revelation striking in that it illustrates the profoundly f***ed up nature and effect of delusional psychoses.  Teddy's doctors, in a final, desperate attempt to save him from his own mind, have constructed an elaborate reenactment of his delusional fantasies.  By demonstrating to Teddy that his delusions ultimately collapse in the face of reality, the doctors try to appeal to the rational remnants of Teddy's mind, hoping his reawakened reason will overcome the psychosis triggered by his emotional anguish.  Or something like that.  My question is:  Even back in 1954, would a psychiatrist have thought it was a good idea to indulge a psychotic's delusions, particularly when the central fixation of the delusion is a desire to obliterate one's own, true identity--i.e., for Teddy to kill Andrew Laeddis?  I kind of doubt it, and the problem is, without the doctors allowing Teddy to enact his fantasies, most of the story never happens.<br /><br />Regardless of its flaws, this is a good, even memorable novel that I found both entertaining and provocative, and you might find it that way, too.doctors try to appeal to the rational remnants of Teddy's mind, hoping his reawakened reason will overcome the psychosis triggered by his emotional anguish.

The production of this album seems to have found the right way to get all the performance with the compositions, getting clean harmonies while maintaining its sharp and crisp side.

0802798225|5.0|Oh. my. gosh. I loved this book! Loved it!     Alex Fuentes is my new favorite bad boy. He's delicious and sexy and believable. He's willing to fight for his family and give them his last dollar. He's tough and proud and ready to take on the blonde cheerleader who looks down on him.    Brittany Ellis may be blonde, and a cheerleader, but she's more than just the image she projects. She too has to fight for her family. She's strong and proud and willing to stand up to the gang leader who likes messing with her head.     The relationship between Alex and Brittany felt REAL. I could see this relationship playing out naturally, and normally, rather than rushed or forced to fit into a book. The tension, the anomosity, the respect they felt for each other was real. And so good.    I could read this book a hundred times and still love every part. I don't just want to read this book, I want to live in it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is a delightful movie about a fantastic world and a lazy little girl who gets her first job in a bathhouse for spirits. Hiyao Miyazaki, praised as the Walt Disney of Japan, has created a wonderful story, rich with  magical logic and unforgettable characters, that is sure to please younger and older viewers, and told it through hand-drawn animation abounding with loving detail and living backgrounds.    Chihiro starts the movie as a listless girl lazing in the backseat of her parents' car as they move to the Japanese countryside. A shortcut through the woods brings them to a decaying theme park that mysteriously draws them in and leads them to a market stall laden with platters of delicious food, where her parents gorge themselves and turn into pigs. Chihiro ends up employed at a majestic bathhouse, run by a greedy old witch named Yubaba, where spirits come to refresh themselves. She makes friends with a dragon boy named Haku, a six-armed boiler room operator, and a mess of soot balls (remember these from My Neighbor Totoro) while figuring out a way to save her parents and return home. In the course of this, she discovers that she's a tough, resourceful little girl.     Every plot development in Spirited Away is a surprise, and the characters are more subtly drawn than the characters in a Disney feature. Yubaba's a nasty witch, but first she is the strict boss of the bathhouse. The monster No-Face can be destructive, but is shy and awkward in his crush on Chihiro.. Haku is a good person, contrary to what the employees say, but is mixed up with Yubaba, which complicates things. The Japanese feel of the movie, in the beautiful styles and textures, kimonos, bowing, and disgusted faces characters make when something icky or smelly enters the scene, also contributes to the Spirited Away experience. The soundtrack is a treat too, especially the melancholy music that plays during the dreamlike sequence when Chihiro rides the train off into the horizon formed by the sea and the sky.    Spirited Away is a lot of fun and has real heart. Regardless of whether animated movies are your thing or not, you will enjoy this one.
0553381687|5.0|I'll save us all some time and keep this short since there are tons of other reviews on this already:<br /><br />I have nothing but good things to say about this book. I must say that this is the first time I actually couldn't wait for the next chapter in a book. I don't think I remember a fiction book ever stirring my emotions like this one did.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspectives of several different characters. Each of those characters has their own life and story. While this is a book about battles for a throne, it doesn't waste time with endless details about fighting. Instead, we read more about their personal lives; the good and the bad in all of them. I find myself caring more about their individual lives than the overall story. At a certain point in the book I realized that I didn't even care much what happened in the story. I loved the characters (all of them...even the jerks) and loved the little world the author created.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would recommend this to casual readers since it's so long and requires a lot of attention and commitment. Because of that and quite a bit of graphic content (in many different forms), I would definitely not recommend it for kids or teens.<br /><br />If you're tired of clich&eacute;d or childish fantasy, consider giving this a try.
B001C09KD0|1.0|I found some pretty interesting facts throughout the book, but I'd rather read them out of an encyclopedia than go crazy reading the adventures of a woman who is clearly confused about who she is, and especially what she believes in. It seems as if she is so desperate to get better that she experiments with so many beliefs. Ghandi embraced different religions, yet his mission was world peace. Liz Gilbert, on the other hand, is a tangled net of new age spiritualism, eastern religions, and Christianity, who doesn't understand any of them. Her book may be a testimony to the difficulties we all experience with our identity, but I would recommend you do not waste your time reading about a woman who never finds hers.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|This is a very interesting release, evocative of various sonic elements of the best alt bands you've heard before.  Bands like Cocteau Twins, The Church, Interpol, The Cure, Echo & The Bunnymen, Fujiya & Miyagi, etc., just to name a few.  But there is a 'freshness' and originality to this understated yet sensual music that is undeniable, and that draws you in.  This music is deja-vu and deja-new at the same time.  I really dig the 'half sung, half spoken' vocals, which remind me of a lot of Steve Kilbey's stellar work with The Church.  One of the best releases of 2009!
0385504225|4.0|This review is for all of you familiar with Dan Brown and his character Robert Langdon. The Lost Symbol is written in much the same way as the prior novels. Langdon is pulled into a plot by the antagonist who plans to wreak havoc on the world. Of course Langdon saves the day. The story starts slow and it isn't until around page 150 that events start to pick up. But once they do it doesn't slow from there. There are a few tight spots where you cant believe what you've read, but Brown gives his readers and (the majority of his)characters what they want. Although not as packed with symbolism as the two prior novels, this was an interesting and enthralling story. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Dan Brown.    Happy reading!

B00005QGAZ|3.0|After musical achievement and commercial success of Off the Wall, Michael Jackson seems to start focusing on developing his entertainer side. The first track from his second solo album Thriller, \\"Wanna be Startin' Somethin',\\" is a polished presentation of his genuine talent in vocal/percussion arrangement with a Latin taste, developed from Off the Wall. The rest of the album is more entertaining, consisting of more narrative songs (i.e., \\"The Girl is Mine,\\" \\"Thriller,\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\"), whose Quincy-produced tracks are, sometimes decorated with sound effects, more synthesized. Guest appearances of Paul McCartney and Eddie Van Halen even make the album more appealing to a wide range of popular music fans. Along with these factors combined, the sequence of mega-hits just sounds overwhelmingly nostalgic to the audience who has experienced the 80s.
B0000DC13U|2.0|I found this a boring waste of money. It could have been condensed down to 10 minutes.
B000002J6H|5.0|60's and 70's music still rock the world and Stills is no different.  We are not helpless, the last song on the album, tells it like it is.  I have over two hundred records I am replacing one at a time.  He is one of the first.  Soft Rock love it.
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|This album redeems the Mule from their last flop, \\"Mighty High\\" (I call it Mighty Low). Yeah, By A Thread is no Dose, but it's definitely more true to form for the Mule than Mighty High. I agree the production could have been better...usually the bass isn't pronounced enough, and the drums are buried a bit by the guitar (which sounds great). The best thing about this album is the display of neverending craftsmanship of songs by Warren et al. They just keep coming up with great-sounding, very original songs! That's not very easy to do these days. If you listen to the current Top 40 crap (yeah, I'm always dissing it, but it deserves it), the songs have the same old chord changes, and not infrequently the same melodies as other hit songs from the past, and I'm not even referring to the goofy sampling junk that's out there. No talent! The Mule destroys that trend with their fresh-sounding, trademark blues rock.    I prefer the old Mule with Woody myself, including all the great jamming and guitar solos as displayed on Live at Roseland Ballroom. But the current version of the Mule at least still has great songs and musicianship...this release does not disappoint in that respect. Sure, I would love it if the guitar solos on this album were longer and more explorative, but I can understand if the Mule doesn't want to burn themselves out doing the same thing from album to album. Actually, the guitar solo on Inside Outside Woman Blues is quite long, intense and soulful, so at least we get the \\"old\\" Mule on that cut anyway...    A great album, no question...more guitar solos would have been nice, but the songcraft is really something!
B000002U9L|5.0|Loved the movie as a kid. My kids love the songs and are original songs from the movie.
B002UD56I6|5.0|I usually do not bother to review but this was absolutely out of this world. Even though it was just rehearsals without a lot of costumes, the style, charisma, talent, and love you feel when you watch the magic in the making is impossible to describe. I believe MJ's early death was the greatest loss of music history but he will live on forever in his music through his fans for decades to come.  It about breaks your heart to know Michael didn't get to finish this incredible final concert run but even in death he has made an UNSTOPABLE COMEBACK! I am so pleased Kenny Ortega and the Jackson Estate continued on with the show as Michael would have wanted. If you are a true MJ fan, THIS IS IT will put a smile on your face, tears in your eyes and you will leave wanting more and that is what the show of a lifetime is all about. I wish more than anything he was still with us, but a small comfort to those who loved him as I do, is to know he passed on preparing for the show of all time doing what he loved most and deep down he knew his comeback was unstopable and he would again reign worldwide as the KING OF POP!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|This set was just released today.  I have not purchased it yet.  The only way this product would get less than five stars would be if something was seriously wrong or if any episodes are edited.   I'm assuming this is just a repackaging of the season sets' discs.   If there is anything wrong, I will come back and address that.   The discs could be bare bones episodes for all I care.  The actual show is what counts.  I couldn't resist the chance to write this review before actually getting it.   I've seen the entire series close together and I've been waiting for this set before buying any seasons of it.    This series is the best series ever.   I have my favorites.  This is one of them.  Its not my personal favorite series ever but I consider it the absolute best.   It would be like if someone said, \\"My personal favorite movie ever is 2004's The Girl Next Door, but I consider Wall-E to be the best movie ever.\\"   Well, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles is my personal favorite series ever, but The Shield is the best series ever.    This story is a must-experience.  I think the greatest moral story ever told.  Even for a rebellious guy like me, it will bend my morals.   It's like having two best friends who are like brothers and not knowing who's side to go on.  You see both sides, but you realize they are both innocent and both guilty as hell.  It's all FUBAR.  Its our system.  That's the way it is.    These characters are so real to me.   I love them very much.   This series spans three years, and it feels like I've spent a lifetime with them.  They are like brothers to me.     The Strike Team.        Claudette and Dutch.   My god.  Those two are like the superiors, the moral compass.   Danny and Julien are like the new hands (arrows) on it.  Finding their direction.  David Acevada is the magnet that knows where he wants his arrow to point.  The Strike Team is the other magnet that takes control of the arrow and points it in every direction, knowing where theywant to go but having no idea what lies in that direction.     And what a hell of a direction they go.    This is the only series I have witnessed from beginning to end that each consecutive season actually tops the previous seasons.  There are SEVEN seasons.  Or Seven Acts to this story.  And it only gets better and better.  After seeing each season from the first one, you would find it hard to believe.   To actually finish the FIFTH season (which you will hear many who've seen it say its probably the best season of anything they've ever seen) and be told that the next two seasons get even better is an unfathomable imagination.    This series delivers.  Serial television are novels to the short stories known as movies (feature films).  And this is that novel that will drag you to hope and deliver you to hell.       EPIC.  THIS STORY IS EPIC.  The characters' arcs are like no other.       I remember seeing numerous promos for this series even when they called it \\"Rampart\\" and \\"Mackey\\".    It looked like some dumb cop show.   I decided to watch the first episode for the hell of it.   It was pretty good.  But I had no idea what I had found.   Over seven years later, just like the Strike Team, I had absolutely no idea that the road I set out on would lead to this.  The pre-premiere promos said, \\"TV you'll never forget\\".   Pretty good prediction, FX.       So complex and genius in its execution.  Nuanced storytelling and direction ensures that this isn't some breezy watch, you need to pay attention to fully understand.   The weave gets more and more complex and brings back little things you wouldn't have remembered if you watched it in a carefree manner.  And it also gets more and more engaging.      I never imagined while in the middle of the series, particularly Season 3, that this series would be allowed to reach its conclusion or that it could even live up to what you could imagine.   Almost all television series get cancelled before their proper conclusions.  Thanks to FX Networks, they followed through 100%.  When watching the final season, its the most amazing contrast and parallel to the first season on how the climactic conclusion plays out and where the characters are now and what they have become.  Genuine.    Experience this.  It will be one of the most important experiences you have in your life.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I went right to level 3 because I am a runner and exercise 5 times a week. I wanted something to mix up my routine and this definitely worked. Gave me a strenuous workout and had me crying uncle. Only downside is it's only 20 minutes so I augment it with 10 more minutes of cardio. This circuit training or bursts of intense periods of cardio are perfect for jump starting your metabolism. Plyometrics I believe is the term. Get ready...
B002MRROKI|5.0|Spirited performance.  Savy setlist.  Slick sonics.  Snappy beat !     That's all, folks.        (this review is for the cd only, stereo version.)
0385504225|4.0|I have to admit I am a big fan of Dan Brown and have read every one of his books to date. DaVinci Code is without doubt, his very best, however each of his books had me reading and not wanting to leave them down.  My wife and I had to do a trip from CA to WA to be there for the birth of our new twin boys, and I knew I was going to have longish periods of free time, so I bought the Lost Symbol and took it with me. Boy, am I glad I did. I have to disagree with some of the other \\"analytical\\" reviews breaking the book up in to sections. Damn it, it is an entertaining fiction novel and I bought it for the sheer entertainment and enjoyment factor.I loved every chapter, short ones and long ones. I had myself Googling Washington DC to look at the city map to familiarize me with the places mentioned and get a feel for the story.  I was at the edge of my seat with this book and each time I had to close it because we needed to be Grandparents, I was frustrated and couldn't wait to get back. I loved the plot and also the unbelievable twist towards the end (won't reveal it here), but it was a nice, but sad turn of events.Unexpected.  As for the Noetic Science, although it was mentioned and explained, I was so curious, I wished Dan would have actually given us a hands on samping of this science. Perhaps this leaves the door open for the next book, to somehow bring this science in to the tale.  If you enjoy a good gripping story with plenty of twists and turns, The Lost Symbol is highly recommended by me. Good reading.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Cranford is a gem -- ranking among the best of the period dramas, such as Pride & Prejudice (Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle version), North & South (Richard Armitage version), The Forsyte Saga (Gina McKee version), Sense & Sensibility (Emma Thompson), Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow), and a new favorite:  Lark Rise to Candleford.  I love the tension between the comfort of tradition and the push toward change (exhibited by the new young doctor's passion for modern medicine and the push for education for the poor).  Mostly, I loved the relationships, the sense of community, the beautiful land, life so full without consumer electronics -- all of which make me long to leave the rat race of our modern world for a slower, gentler, more connected way of life.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has the smoothest voice in the world.  What a pleasure for the ears!    \\"Come Away With Me\\" stays with you from the moment you first hear it.    A must-have CD!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I was searching amazon for a new period drama, found this one, and decided to purchase it based on the reviews and the quality of actors -- including Julia Sawalha (Pride & Prejudice and Cranford), Brendan Coyle (North & South), Ben Miles (The Forsyte Saga), Dawn French and Claudie Blakely.  I was not disappointed.  It was absolutely fabulous and I didn't want it to end.  In fact, I've watched it a second time since purchasing it a month ago.  I cannot wait until they release series two in the U.S. (it's already available in Europe). If you're thinking of buying it, don't hesitate.  It's well worth the $42, ranking up there with P&P, N&S, Cranford, The Forsyte Saga, Sense & Sensibility (Emma Thompson version, which I happen to like better than the recent Andew Davies version), Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow version), Persuasion (Amanda Root version), etc. (I love period drama and own just about every one released).  What better way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon?  Enjoy!
0811870987|5.0|I don't have the book in my hands yet (my daughter just sent me a link to Zuckerman's astonishing website - go see both the photographs and his film). I'm a lifelong ornithologist and bibliophile, and I've never seen anything like this man's work. Were they, indeed, photos or were they a whole new kind of superrealistic, microscopically detailed paintings? I couldn't tell. The sense of astonishment with this work is not just the vividness of the white backgrounds that isolate the subjects; it's equally, again and again, the startling perspectives on the bird's body and plumage. With each picture, you see birds as you have never seen them before.    It's not easy to do genuinely original work is a field already so saturated. This man has done it.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|I am not sure why everyone is making such a big deal about this album.  I am happy Whitney finally wised up and stopped using drugs but it has taken a toll on her voice BIG TIME!  Just because she decided to stop doing wrong doesn't mean her album should receive more hype than it deserved.
B002L3RVCY|3.0|Finally, here it is! George Lucas has, with the Clone Wars series, achieved what he set out to do so many years ago: he's created a fantastical science fiction series for kids.<br /><br />I'm not begrudging him this. After all, Lucas has stated numerous times that *this* is what Star Wars is meant to be. I loved the original trilogy ... when I was a kid. As an adult, I see the flaws in each of the first three films. Especially ROTJ, whose Ewoks were so clearly family-centric.<br /><br />So good on Lucas for achieving this. My 5 y.o. loves this series, and I can see why: the iconic-looking clones, the lightsaber-weilding Jedi, the two-dimensional bad guys you love to hate, space battles, unusual aliens ... it's a child's playland full of colorful characters and just a little bit of complexity. As an adult, I don't enjoy it so much ... though I have to admit that some of the episodes are far more enjoyable than THE PHANTOM MENACE.
0740748475|5.0|I just purchased this set to give my family for Christmas. After reading some comments about the bindings being glued, I considered returning the set. When I closely inspected my set, I see they are sewn but the signatures(bundles of pages) are small and there are no head and tail bands. The first and last signatures are also not reinforced -something I think needful in such large heavy books.<br /><br />Perhaps they changed the bindings after so many duds in the earlier sets.<br /><br />I purchased McMeel's Far Side set some years ago and that set has stood up well to regular use.<br /><br />This set is beautiful and I will enjoy introducing my family to one of my favorite comic strips. They will learn that Calvin is not that little urinating urchin depicted on so many car windows.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|No, it's not perfect.  Yes, some episodes could perhaps have been better.  But given that the Gemini and Mercury programs were covered in The Right Stuff, and Apollo 13 was covered in the movie of the same name, it does an excellent job of demonstrating the heroism and engineering marvel that was the Apollo program.  It covers all aspects, from the astronauts, to their wives, to the engineers, to the administrators.  Special effects are wonderful, the individual astronauts are portrayed with great faithfulness, and each mission is approached uniquely and with fresh insight.  While some could look at Apollo 12 and 14-17 and think they're all pretty much the same, this series not only makes each crew and mission unique, it also brings attention to the previously unheralded missions that led up to Apollo 11, save the Apollo 8 mission.  My only criticism is the relatively sparse attention paid to Apollo 10.  But this one criticism aside, if you're a fan of or interested at all in the men, both astronauts and engineers, as well as their families, that made history and put men on the moon -- this is well worth the money.  I sadly doubt we'll ever see any endeavor as amazing, historical, heroic or inspiring as the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs again.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Before listening to Crazy Love, I was not a fan of Michael Buble. It's not that I disliked him, I just never really listened to his music. I had heard from friends and family that he had a great voice, so I decided to go ahead and give Crazy Love a chance. Before I listened for the first time, I was told to think Frank Sinatra. While Michael is no old \\"Blue Eyes\\", he can definitely hold his own.     A few of the songs were unfamiliar to me at first because of the big orchestra build up, but once Michael starting singing, I was taken back to a simpler time when singers really sang instead of relying on electronic enhancements. I'm a sucker for the big band era, so I enjoyed this album immensely. My favorite tracks are: Hold On and the bonus track, Whatever it Takes (so glad it was included!)    I now consider myself a Michael Buble fan. I've seen other reviews of this album where established fans were not too crazy about Crazy Love. Makes me wonder what else I'm missing if this album didn't live up to expectations. Guess I'll have to go check out his other albums.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|The packaging was quite impressive but what I loved most about this is the fact it comes with both Blu Ray and DVD which makes it perfect for traveling. The quality is absolutely amazing - even my husband was impressed, it is far superior to the older version I watched as a little girl and the sound quality is amazing, the picture is crisp and bright and gives a totally new perspective on a timeless classic. My 4 year old loves this so much she makes me play it every day lol. Both the Blu Ray and DVD menus were extremely easy to navigate and that is an added plus. I bought a few of these for Christmas presents as well :)
0618918248|1.0|One interesting facet of Dawkin's writing is that he distinguishes between a personal God and the more impersonal God envisioned by deists.  Dawkins focuses on Einstein who observed a marvelous order in the universe but disavowed a belief in a personal God. Reading the book has caused me to be more disciplined in recognizing whether my prayers are directed to a personal God or to the laws of nature.<br /><br />Dawkins belabors -- at length -- the typical cliches of atheists.  His stridency and laborious writing style I found very irritating.  I did not finish the book.
B0000057C5|5.0|OK, about all I can say is this album is great.  Just buy it.  Listen to the samples or Youtube Rammstein if you are unfamiliar with them.  Dont buy it and complain that the lyrics are in German.  The lyrics are in German but they rock.  Great album to put in the CD player and drive.  Just watch your speed and watch for redlight cameras.  Also a great album to listen to while working out.
0307291650|5.0|Very nice hardback with pretty endpapers and nice ribbon bookmark. Looks great on your shelf! A great collector's edition for fans of the series.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|After several listens, this has become my favorite Megadeth album since \\"Countdown to Extinction\\". There are some really great riffs and interesting melodic twists to be found throughout. Dave and the crew keep it tight and the production is smooth, with all instruments receiving a good share of the mix. The vocals come across as more growl and less sneer on this outing, but it seems to fit well with the compositions. I could go through a track-by-track description, but this has already been done well by other reviewers.     Bottom line for me is that this is for the most part exactly the sort of high-energy metal I've always loved, with that complex rhythm/lead interaction that lets the listener know it is not a mindless chug-fest. Mustaine is a progressive writer with enough creativity to keep it interesting even after all these years. Kudos for that!     Overall, I'd say this is a winner. Not necessarily top of the heap, but definitely worth adding to the library and enjoying.
B000002MUN|5.0|It's hard to believe this album was released in 1994! It doesn't sound dated whatsoever. If anything Rick Rubin's spare production of this album gives it an almost timeless quality. This album could've been released last week. As for songs? They're all fantastic. From classic rock, acoustic folk, and beautiful Rickenbacker jangle pop - it's all here. Lyrically, this is one of TP's most reflective album's ever. I always felt the overall mood of the album's theme was 'make the most of this life' and 'don't be afraid to move on when you know you must move on'. It's a great feel good album, and if you're a Petty fan or new to his music this is the one to get. You'll love it.
B002PGO7X8|5.0|This CD/DVD is amazing. The tracks are organized in a story format, and I wasn't a big fan of Kid Cudi before this - just heard his popular songs on the radio - but this converted me! Especially his collabs with Ratatat and MGMT. It's great and I can't wait to hear more from this talented young artist.[[ASIN:B002FOQY04 Man on the Moon: The End of Day [CD/DVD Combo] [Deluxe Edition]]]
B002KDUDG6|5.0|After watching Michael on Oprah, I bought the CD.  WOW! What a great CD. Michael is so smooth. What a wonderful voice.I especially like 'Haven't Met You Yet\\".
B001MW0J2O|5.0|I've been a fan of AC for a while and I'm excited to have a good starting point to hand to people who want to get into them but can't wrap their heads around some of their more abstract music. It's still got the wall of sound happening, but there are more refrains and such throughout to make it a little easier to walk into if you aren't already a fan of the moer left of center stuff. Bluish is easily my fav track on here, but there isn't a single track that I skip over when I listen to it. The whole album is just cohesive and absolutely delish.
0375704027|5.0|Japan in 1969 comes very much to life in this wonderful book. The search for identity is written in a self-biographical fashion. This is never boring, and although seemingly sad at times, also just outright young, hopeful and funny.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|this a very interesting book, i think that you should be atleast 14 tho because of the cuss words and some sex terms are said and metion. kids should ask parents to read some of the book to decide if they can read it or not.
1400097029|3.0|John Banville is one of the best prose stylists working in the English language today. His writing has an effortless, gliding nature and he can turn a phrase like no other. He can at one point deploy a prodigious vocabulary without seeming overwrought:     'There is a name De'Ath, with that fancy medial capital and apotropaic apostrophe which fool no one.'     ... and at another express the complexity of disorientation in the simplest phrase:    'Everything seemed to be something else.'    Also: Banville is not an unfeeling writer. He speaks of 'the soundless detonation that love is supposed to set off in even a boy's unsusceptible breast'. Plus he can be quite witty. On an overweight character, he writes: 'When she tottered to her feet the wicker chair cried out in excruciated relief.'  And despite some languorously described unhappiness in this book, he has not yet sunk into the woe-is-me marsh that has become the final resting-place of the unbearable J.M. Coetzee.    And yet, and yet. I bought this book because of the promise of a story leading to a worthwhile revelation at the climax. But that's not quite what I got. The blurb on the back of the book claims that the narrator, Max Morden, is 'both escaping a recent loss and confronting a distant trauma', and that the 'distant trauma' which took place in his childhood 'would haunt him for the rest of his years and shape everything that was to follow'. Since you might buy the book based on the promise of this claim (I know I did), I think I should explain - without in any way spoiling the story - why that promise goes unfulfilled.    There are two narrative threads. The first - which takes place in the present - involves the recent passing of the protagonist's wife from a terminal illness. The second involves something traumatic but mysterious that happened at the end of a Summer in the protagonist's boyhood, when a family with two children of about his age came to stay at his seaside village.    Thus both narrative threads involve making the reader wait around while nothing in particular happens. The first thread does not have much gas in it because a plot about a terminal illness - of all plots - is one whose ending is definitively foreordained. What possible surprises can there be? But the other plot-line, we are assured, does hold out the promise of a surprising, indeed 'haunting' conclusion.     Actually that's not quite what happens. The incident which brings closure to this plotline would be unusual were it to happen in real life, but when it happens in a well-written novel, it just seems self-consciously artistic. (It does involve a very Keatsian conceit, and I also thought that therein I detected echoes of Mann's 'Death in Venice'.) The worst defect is that there is nothing in the narrative which foreshadows the event itself. It comes so out of the blue that it seems pasted on, as though the author only decided on it at the last minute, and any of his available alternatives could equally have served the purpose. One is left thinking: 'That's it?'    One other point on Banville's characterisation. The protagonist of 'The Sea' is an art historian. The protagonist of 'Shroud' is an art dealer. The protagonist of 'The Untouchable' is an art museum curator. The protagonist of 'The Book of Evidence' is an art thief. The protagonist of 'Athena' is an art historian. That's essentially the same character in five novels. Not a good sign.    'The Sea' is a truly great novel: it's hard to think of anything recently released which could match the vividness of the writing. But the reader does need to be aware that it is somewhat plotless: it embodies not so much a story as a kind of leisurely stroll around a garden of picturesque prose.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Excelent packaging and photo's. Sound was improved and so is a great addition to my collection. My only disappointment was that they didn't release the set on the US albums. That is of course because that's the albums I grew up listening to.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Sometimes I think the old boy has really lost it. Not only are his live performances a complete shambles, but now he records an unlistenable Christmas album. I've been a huge fan of his for 40 years but I know bad music when I hear it. And I'm not going to give him a pass just because he wrote The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll like so many other critics and listeners have done when they review this musical debacle. I'm a fan of his great work but I'm not a lemming. Purchase this for the charitable benefit but don't recommend it as serious music.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Very good seller, excellent service.  The CD was bought after buying the DVD of the same concert....we wanted something we could play in the car.  The quality of the CD is very good and we would recommend this concert to most everyone.
0882709194|1.0|This version of Origin of Species is coming to a college campus near you for free on the anniversary of this seminal work of biological literature. On the surface, it may seem like a nod to one of the most profound writings in the history of scientific literature, but after reading the 50 page foreword by Ray Comfort, one will most likely see the encroachment of pseudo-science, \\"quote mining\\", and religious propaganda into the realm of academia.    The masquerading as a credible version of this historical piece of literature is enough to keep any critical thinker up at night. From \\"Darwin's racism\\" to New Earth Creationist viewpoints, the foreword will prompt many of us to beg the question: What will be vandalized next?
B0002S94BG|5.0|I bought the Jeff Buckley-Grace CD and DVD set.  I am VERY pleased.  I received the product quickly, it was in great condition, and I am enjoying it big time.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|This is a great classic to share with my kids.  The extras made it special.  It's a video that we plan to take with us to our family get-together at Thanksgiving.
0545123267|5.0|I loved this story from the first page.  It has everything-love, intrigue, betrayal and danger.  The story is told through the eyes of Grace and Sam so the point of view shifts from chapter to chapter but this never becomes confusing or distracting.  If I had one complaint it was that the story was over too soon, I could have easily enjoyed another 200 pages.  Oh well, maybe the author will write a sequel.
0061719544|4.0|I really like Craig Ferguson.  I enjoyed his movies, his first book and catch his tv show when I can but I was disappointed by the simple-minded political humour in the first chapter.  I should have been warned by the sleazy recommendation by Keith Olbermann on the book jacket.  I mean- Craig says that Richard Wolfe is clear-thinking,Dana Perino is crazy and Dick Cheney is evil?!!!!  I read that as satire, but, sadly, I think he believes it.  I thought he chose to be an American because he was at least fond of the country but he dives into the morass of politics in the first chapter and shows his Hollywood understanding of it.  I am glad I don't let politics dissuade me from reading books I like, though. The rest of the book was fine, it is nice to have background and understand motivation of a popular actor.  He is still witty and I enjoyed his comments about his family, growing up, etc. It is a treat to hear his cheeky delivery in my mind as I read. And 'Saving Grace' is still one of my favourite movies, I won't hold politics and a tendency to have poor judgment against him!
B002OVEB5S|2.0|I've been a Slayer fan since day one and this just is more of the Christ Illusion style.  That is, rushed-forward lyrics, single note vocals, lack of the sweet spidery riffs that gave Slayer that evil signature sound.  There was one point on Snuff about 1 minute in that recaptured that old Slayer sound, but it was gone as soon as I noticed it.  Slayer has not produced anything as good as their former days since Seasons in the Abyss.  I like Slayer still, and I'd still see them live because they kick @$$, but this is crap for them.  I'm not saying this is good just because \\"it's Slayer\\".  Slayer still needs to meet the standard of quality they set forth so long ago.  If people keep accepting less and less from them, then they just are allowing Slayer to sink by not demanding more.  Slayer can do better than this.  Seriously.
1416594787|5.0|First, let me start by saying I am an unapologetic fan of Richard Dawkins.  Secondly, I think it important to be aware that Dawkins is 'devotional' to the sentiment that natural selective pressures are able to account for the entirety of evolution.  While this isn't particularly relevant to this book, and it shouldn't be taken as criticism, it is a worthwhile frame to have in mind.    Richard Dawkins has presented a near perfect 'primer' on Evolution and Evolutionary Theory in general.  It is a smooth flowing narrative that guides the reader step by step through the broad sweeping ideas that lead through the accumulation of various forms of evidence (morphological, geographical distribution, molecular chemistry, fossil, etc) to build an understanding in the reader of what Evolution is and what kinds of evidence are available to present for its acceptance and the kinds of studies being engaged in.    It is a tribute to the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species.  And it is simply brilliant.  I might be inclined to dock him a mark or two for unnecessarily tweaking creationists noses every once in a while, but I also recognize what Richard Dawkins' \\"voice\\" is in his writing, and I can easily over the extraneous tweaking for the greater enjoyment of his style.    Whether You are someone that accepts Evolution or rejects it, this is an incredibly worthwhile read.  It is a reasonably easy read, and should be enjoyable to all.  Even if You are one that rejects evolution, it shouldn't dissuade You from reading this book if for no other reason than to at least get a thumbnail sketch of what it is that You are rejecting.  Dawkins provides us with an extraordinary primer on the subject of evolution that can enable us all to come to a common understanding of what the subject is, even if we don't all agree with the conclusion.    I can recommend this book to any and everyone without the slightest hesitation.
0316069906|5.0|I identified with the struggle and desire to become a vegetarian.  I enjoyed the family stories and liked the bits on information between larger points.  It was easy to read in small segments during a busy day and it was a nice boost for me to keep on track and trying to stop eating meat because I want to be vegetarian and at some point vegan.  (Damn you Cheese!  Why must you taste so good?!)
1416955070|3.0|If Harry Potter and Wicked Lovely had a book baby it would be City of Bones. I had been looking forward to reading this book for a long time, and I really have no good reason for waiting as long as I did.<br /><br />Good world building is paramount in urban fantasy, and City of Bones, if a little small feeling at times, doesn't disappoint.  In the Bible, Nephilim are the children of humans and fallen angles, but in City of Bones (COB), they are the result of the Angel Raziel mixing his own blood with human blood together in a magical Mortal Cup. Nephilim, known as Shadowhunters, are demon hunters that exist (along with angels, demons, vampires, werewolves, faeries etc.) in an alternate New York.<br /><br />15 going on 16 year old Clary Fray accidentally stumbles into this world when she witnesses  three teenage Shadowhunters kill a demon in human guise.  Clary and her mundane (basically muggle, or human) best friend Simon are soon swept up into a race to find the Mortal Cup before it falls into the hands of the villainous  former Shadowhunter Valentine.<br /><br />Packed with lots of action, and young romantic angst, COB is not groundbreaking in any way, but it is a fun read for lovers of paranormal YA. There are some lengthy explanatory passages that feel out of place given the urgency of the situation in which they appear. Some of the glib/pithy dialogue falls flat, especially when uttered when other characters were near death etc.  Pulled me out of the story a bit.<br /><br />I'll also admit, without revealing any spoilers, that the ending revelation made me extremely uncomfortable. I'm still kind of mad about it.  I haven't read the rest of the series yet, but I hope the author addresses the implications of that revelation, or better yet reveals something that negates that revelation.  I'm not holding my breath on that one though.  On her website, Cassandra Clare offers these words:<br /><br />  \\"At the risk of spoiling anyone, all I can say is that it's more than just a twist; if you're really invested in Jace and Clary, you shouldn't give up on them yet -- there's still a lot to come in their future, a lot of surprises about their history, and plenty more developments in the Jace/Clary/Simon love triangle.\\"<br /><br />Jace was easily the most interesting character.  I found his behavior, given his upbringing, to be very authentic.  I also enjoyed how his character and motivations were revealed slowly throughout the story.  I'll be reading  the rest of this series just to find out more about him.<br /><br />Sexual Content: Some talk about about sex from minors.

B002OEBMN4|4.0|If you're looking for a Slayer album that rivals all-time classics like Reign in Blood or Seasons in the Abyss, this ain't it. At the same time, let's be realistic. This is Slayer 20+ years later. All in all, I think this is a rather good effort.    Pros:  *The songs are pretty good. Some are better than others, but I'm not compelled to skip any tracks. From start to finish, this is a solid, consistent recording.     *It sounds more like pure, classic Slayer than Christ Illusion (though I enjoyed Christ Illusion too, BTW). If you didn't like Christ Illusion, you'll like this better but don't expect to be blown away.    *It's Slayer. It sounds like Slayer. It's good.    Cons:  *The production is a mixed bag. Tom's vocals sound good. Dave's drums are heavy. The rhythm guitars sound terrible. They're thin and weak. Producer Greg Fidelman needs to find a new career. He's worthless.    *The riffs, while generally good, aren't particularly complex. On a technical level, everything can be played with one guitar. I wonder if this is a product of Jeff and Kerry writing songs separately these days. Neither seem to write song with dual-riffing in mind anymore.    *Even when Jeff and Kerry play the same riff simultaneously, it still sounds like one guitar due to the weak production. Did I mention that Greg Fidelman's worthless?    Overall, this is a good album by Slayer circa 2009. Any Slayer fan with reasonable expectations will enjoy it. Can it live up to the band's classic releases? Of course not! The Slayer of today can't possibly play with the strength and power of the Slayer of twenty years ago. That said, Slayer can still deliver the goods. Just don't expect the goods to be as in good condition as they were 20 years ago.
B000ZECQ08|2.0|When I watched the movie felt quite disappointed. I read the book and there was action, laugh, love, mistery, anger, distress, tension, pain... but you won't find any of it in the film, at least not in meaninful quantities. Don't even think of learning something about Voldemort's or the Prince's past or intentions; for that you'll have to read the book, which just happen to be named after the latter caracter, but it seems the producers, directors and script writers didn't know/notice it. I can understand some parts had to be cut in order to fit the movie, but the cut turned into butchery and some important parts didn't receive a good treatment, such as the Unbreakable Vow scene, Dumbledore's pain in the Horcrux Cave, or the final battle in the Castle. Also, olympics jumps from one scene to the other and unnecesary ones such as the burning of the Weasly's family house made this movie not as enjoyable as the previous ones. A real shame.

0061854549|4.0|In the past decade or so Behavioural Economics has become all the rage in both academic circles and among the general public. The financial crisis that started with the bursting of the sub-prime mortgage bubble in the US a couple of years ago has given behavioural economists a major boost.<br /><br />The basic premise of behavioural economists is that humans are not necessarily rational when they make economic or financial decisions. One of the cornerstone assumptions of \\"traditional\\" economics is that we decide based on rational analysis of costs and benefits and seek to maximise our financial gains. It turns out this is not the case and many of our decisions are driven by \\"irrational\\" factors that defy the premises of traditional economics.<br /><br />Professor Dan Ariely is another ex-Israeli scientist that has popularised Behavioral Economics with his book Predictably Irrational. Using relatively simple experiments he shows that many of our decisions are influenced by irrational factors, but more importantly, that this irrational behaviour is, in many cases, predictable. In other words, contrary to popular belief (at least in the last 300 or so years of the \\"scientific era\\"), humans are inherently irrational.<br /><br />Here are a few examples:<br /><br />- People will feel better taking a medicine that costs 10 times as much as another, identical, medicine.<br />- When faced with a free product, we will likely \\"buy\\" it even if they don't need it.<br />- Sexual arousal will lead people to change their behaviour and perform deeds they deem immoral.<br />- We will think food or drink are better if they are presented in a more glamorous setting.<br /><br />Ariely's book is highly entertaining and provides some delightful nuggets of truth about ourselves. But I didn't find many of his \\"discoveries\\" surprising. It is true that we like to see ourselves as rational machines, but most of our life experiences clearly demonstrate this is not the case. Blind belief in a purely rational brain is, well, irrational. The work of Nobel prize winner Daniel Kahenman (with his partner Amos Tversky), around how people decide between alternatives involving risk, has been known for many years. Ariely's achievement is mainly in popularising the subject and presenting it in a way that most people can understand.f Nobel prize winner Daniel Kahenman (with his partner Amos Tversky), around how people decide between alternatives involving risk, has been known for many years.

B002JIOQCO|4.0|This is a good album from a good band. i have seen them live 3 times with the old line up and their shows are active and entertaining, and the new album shows some evolution to their sound. not as easy a listen as the first album, but one that might stick with you longer, with lots of riffs and hooks that really work. not an album that will change the world, just something to drive around with cranked to eleven.
0061914177|1.0|I bought this book excited to learn how to grow my business using technology as Gary did with his liquor store only to be disapointed.  The book is poorly written and semed to be written overnight.  Gary paints a picture of blogging and videoing your way to fame and fortune with very thin ideas.  I have been in biz dev for 15 years in technology and none of Garys ideas have a chance, I was sorry to see a guy who sems to have a great following write a book that has such a poor premise.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I love this movie because it's like someone said \\"hey we all love Jane Austin but lets mix it up a little bit, create a little choas\\". As long as this movie is I can't ever just watch part of it, I have to watch the whole thing. The characters are much more exaggerated than the original films, which is actually a lot of fun. For a being a remake with a twist this is actually a really fun movie to watch.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: 9 out of 10: Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman is in a league of his own. If cloning is ever allowed in the United States we need to clone Mr. Kaufman. (If there is any community that will embrace cloning it will be Hollywood. Name any other place in America where nepotism is a religion. Hiring your own clone is the ultimate in nepotism.)    Charlie Kaufman has found that fine line between realistic dialog and interesting dialog. Characters talk, fight and fall in love just like they do in real life. But unlike most movies that try to mirror real life speech Kaufman makes it interesting. (Of course it helps that Kaufman is always throwing in the bizarre; such as adulterous homicidal book authors addicted to sniffing Angel Trumpet or people entering John Malkovich's head.)    Now just imagine if a Kaufman clone could, oh I don't know, help George Lucas write romantic dialog. (If there is anyone who occupies the opposite side of the good dialog screen writing scales its Lucas. His dialog is so wooden it would embarrass a marionette. Plus think of the Variety headline \\"Kaufman Clone helps pen Clones\\")    Oh the movie. Eternal Sunshine has some great performances especially by a subdued Jim Carrey. (This should surprise but after his brilliant turn in Man on the Moon, the only real surprise is how with his quiet desperate performance you forget its Carrey.) There is a really good subplot about the goings on at a mind erasure clinic. (The movie sensibly sets it up as a no big deal four-man operation like one of those laser eye surgery places in a strip mall.)    And there is a really realistic romance between Carrey and Kate Winslet that blows most movies away. Currently ranked Fifty-Seventh greatest movie of all time by the IMDb. Eternal Sunshine is one movie you won't be able to get out of your head.
B002S0OBFK|1.0|This movie is based on HYPE and advertisement only.  I saw it last week with five friends.  NO ONE even jumped, much less screamed in the entire theater.  What a JOKE this movie is.  It's NOT scary, it's NOT believable and it's NOT even entertaining.  Don't waste your money.  The trailer for the movie contains ALL the \\"scary\\" parts.  The rest of the movie is watching two people sleep, or talk, or knit, or argue.  It's boring and it's stupid and it's not even close to being scary.  Wait for it to come on TV, it won't be long.
B000CNE092|4.0|One of my favorite elements of this movie is how this princess is portrayed.  My daugter who is 4 is absolutely obsessed with princesses!  I find Anastasia to be the most independent of all the major animated princesses, (all others being Disney princesses).  In Anastasia, there is actually a development of a relationship with the love interest, (Beauty and the Beast being the other notable example).  Also, though Anastasia is a princess, she ultimately decides that being one isn't the end all, be all of happiness.  I don't have a complete aversion to the other princesses.  But the theme of falling in love at first sight with almost exclusively princes gets old to me.  Not that everyone doesn't need to be saved from time to time by a \\"knight in shining armor\\", metaphorically speaking.  But I find it a refreshing interpretation that it come from an imperfect person that one actually knows more than a few hours.  The animation and music are great, too.  My only one real hesitation is with Rasputin.  He's a little on the gross side.  My daughter would obviously be more grossed out than an older child.  Nonetheless, as an adult, he still kind of gets to me.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|The only way I can tell you about this film, is that I really love it! The movie has solid animation, great characters, and plenty of action & comedy! In my opinion, it is the best out of the Ice Age Trilogy.     I especially love the one eyed weasel Buck (Simon Pegg) and the Tyrannosaur family, who adopt Sid as one of their own. I have written out the plot below, but be warned, it contains spoilers!    Ellie (Queen Latifah) and Manny (Ray Romano) are expecting their first child, and Manny is obsessed with making life perfect and safe for the family, since his first experiences as a husband and father went bad when his family was killed by hunters. At the same time, Diego (Denis Leary) finds himself unable to catch a cocky gazelle (Bill Hader) he has been stalking and decides to leave the herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger. Sid (John Leguizamo) grows jealous of Manny and Ellie and \\"adopts\\" three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern and call them Eggbert, Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid instead looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus the next morning.    Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the other animals' young and ruins a playground Manny built for Ellie's baby. A female Tyrannosaurus, Momma, whose eggs Sid stole, soon returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit.     Manny, Ellie, Crash, and Eddie (Seann William Scott, Josh Peck) follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an Ankylosaurus threatens the herd despite Diego's efforts to fend it off; they are saved from a further crowd of angry reptiles by an insane, one-eyed weasel named Buckminster, or Buck (Simon Pegg).    Buck has been living in this jungle for some time and is chasing Rudy (a huge albino Baryonyx), intending toavenge the eye he lost to it. He agrees to lead the herd through the jungle's perils to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid and her babies.     In the meantime, Sid and Momma try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring; he loses this contest, but is soon welcomed into the family regardless. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the family and attacked by Rudy. Sid is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls.    As the herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labor and a Guanlong pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. Manny doubles back to protect her and Diego fends off further attacks, while Buck takes Crash and Eddie ahead to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered Pteranodon only to been chased by a flock of Quetzalcoatlus on the way and saves his life.     Manny reaches Ellie, and there is suddenly a reaction, the cry of a newborn baby, then he sees that it is a girl. He wants to name her Ellie, or Little Ellie, but Ellie instead names her Peaches after the fruit (and the codeword they had chosen for Ellie to use if she went into labor during the trip). Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to \\"his\\" children as he returns to the herd and learns of Peaches' birth.    Before they can exit the jungle, Rudy attacks at full force; Buck lures Rudy away from the group and is nearly eaten himself, before Diego saves him at the last second. They then ensnare him briefly, but he escapes and resumes his onslaught. The herd is saved by the timely arrival of Momma, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff before roaring her victory. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck - now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone - decides to join the herd and live on the surface.     However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive; he changes his mind and sends the herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time so that no one else can go down there. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and admit that Sid did a good job looking after Momma's children (though Manny tells Diego that he will never let Sid babysit Peaches). Diego decides to remain with the herd, while Buck stays where he wants to be: underground, battling it out with Rudy.    The storyline is great, the characters are awesome, and the pace of the film is very fast. Basically, it is a film that you shouldn't miss out on. So far, its the best animated film of 2009 (that I've seen).    My advice, buy this DVD. It's a great movie that is sure to please both young and old alike. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to go prehistoric with Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs!

0060899220|5.0|After working a few years in food service, and watching a bit of No Reservations I picked up this book, and I definitely wasn't dissapointed.  Anthony tells a raw story of how the world of professional chefdom really works.  It's all very intriguing and well written.  One thing I really liked is that I could almost hear Anthony narrating it while I was reading it...meaning that it's written very much in the style that he talks and narrates on his show, and that the book wasn't heavily over-edited.  Also, as someone with a pipe dream of possibly some day owning a restaurant or something of that sort, this definitely steered me away from it.  Overall, it was great read cover to cover, and I'd definitely recommend.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I saw Sting and his group perform \\"Soul Cake\\" (from the album) on the Today Show last week.  I loved everything about the song.  His vocal; the backup singers; the instrumental portions are gorgeous. It's a great song.  I was so impressed I purchased the CD today; without listening to any of the additional 14 songs.  Yikes!  What in the 'tweet' Sting's attempting to create with the bad sore throat sound is a mystery.    It doesn't work for me.  I didn't expect a holly jolly Christmas album, but thought they'd be some lovely winter music. What I hear is mostly an album of  dull and dreary.  Wish I could, but can't recommend this one.    Disappointed.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|So, this is a movie about an elite \\"if no one else can do it, we do\\" squad right. They hyped it up so much that the errors are just amazing. If they were elite... when attacked would they not type in the self destruct codes at the first sign that they could be stolen? I know that stupidity and holly wood go hand in hand but come one... if your gonna portray a super elite squad then try not to insult everyones intelligence. Let's just say that the movie goes from bad to worse and then somehow ends up in hell along with the poor viewer. Pretty pretty effects do not make a movie good.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I did not see this in theatres on release as the trailers made it look like a big, overly wrought romance... a la Gone with the Wind meets Cimarron and not my cup of tea. Nor am I a fan of Nicole Kidman, so no appeal there. And when I finally saw it, I found it nothing like I expected nor was it much like many of the other reviewers have portrayed. Yes, it used broad, almost stereo-typed characters to carry the \\"Anglo\\" story line, and yes, there were actions in the movie that required the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\"; that hardly seems unusual.    However, the thing that made the movie unusual in a most positive way was the telling of the story from the point of view of the racially-mixed \\"outcast\\" little boy, Nullah.  This introduced an entirely different point of view, signficantly, at least for Americans, of the characters and the story line.  While I do not pretend to know much about aboriginal culture, the concepts and importance of \\"singing\\" and \\"stories\\" were presented sufficiently well to open up the ideas to the large portion of the American audience which likely is unfamiliar with this.   A number of strong and appealing cultural ideas were referenced or illustrated either in the dialog / actions of the aboriginal characters or occasionally the brief comments of \\"The Drover\\": the geographical mapping of the aborigines through \\"singing\\" (music); the importance of one's story and how one connects to the \\"tribe\\" / ancestors / universe through \\"singing\\" (stories).  In fact, the word \\"sing\\" as used by Nullah and The Drover in the movie clearly has a richer meaning in this aboriginal context, one which cannot easily be translated directly into American English and which is worth exploring.    I thought Jackman did well in a role that called for a man's man--in American movies cowboys are not too chatty, either...men of action, mostly defined by showing up and doing, so I remain puzzled that other reviewers thought Jackman was too silent. However, the actorsthat stole the show were the aboriginal actors.   Uncle George was marvelous and mystical throughout--totally elegant, grounded, and convincing as the shaman \\"singing\\" (guiding with knowledge) his charges through the desert.  The Drover's brother-in-law was excellent, playing his role with a quiet dignity.      But this movie was Nullah's story, from beginning to end, and the beautiful Brandon Walters is a revelation as to what a pure talent can produce when given the right chance; for that we can thank Mr. Luhrmann's effort to get that key role right. I do not know who actually did the singing (humming, chanting) which seemed to eminate from Nullah--if it was dubbed or done by Brandon Walters.  But this movie has indelibly burned in my mind the earnest, trusting face with huge brown eyes in  and the pure, musical tones of the child-mystic when Nullah utters this simple line (and variations on it): \\"I sing you to me.\\"  For this line alone, whether taken as a simple plot facilitator or as a greater metaphor, I would see this movie again and again.
055380684X|5.0|This book was a surprise. Somehow I expected something about how to spot talent, hire talent, or use talent for corporate success. What I got was a great book on learning and brain development. This well written and well researched book discusses the power of deep practice on the Myelin coating in the brain. Myelin is the insulating sheath surrounding nerve enabling them to conduct impulses between the brain and other parts of the body. The electrical current must travel without being corrupted, scrambled, diverted from the proper path, or leaking energy. Therefore, myelin is like the layer of plastic insulation surrounding an interior wire, which is the nerve.<br /><br />Myelin increases when we engage in deep practice. Much like Gladwell discusses in Outliers, success comes after thousands of hours of good correct practice. This intense practice occurs when we are in a zone of focus, repeating correct actions over and over again, stopping and correcting mistakes, and repeating correct actions again. This grows and thickens that myelin over the nerves allowing for faster more accurate responses.<br /><br />Before we can practice we need motivation, which Coyle calls ignition. He also discusses why some motivation sticks and some does not using examples from a variety of sports and educational settings. This is not the world of pep-talks, but of inspiration that comes from the a wow effect he calls HSE. We suddenly see someone just like us who won a golf tournament and realize that maybe we could play golf well. Coyle give numerous examples that support the HSE.<br /><br />Finally Coyle points out the importance of good coaching. He reports on many studies on coaching and teaching that change our notions of the \\"sage on the stage\\" and encourage us to be a \\"guide on the side\\" to be effective. He found that short, precise and intense feedback is more effective than lectures. He uses examples from education citing the KIPP and KEEP projects, as well as more sports.<br />This is a great book. I was inspired to return to my piano and work on my novel. The more I practice the more myelin I grow and the better I get. Intense focused practice in the sweet zone is the secret. See perfection, measure my distance from it, reach, repeat.<br /><br />Great book for educators and coaches, or anyone interested in brain research or cognitive psychology. Great book to get anyone motivated to try harder!was inspired to return to my piano and work on my novel. The more I practice the more myelin I grow and the better I get.

B002JIOQCO|4.0|Wolfmother delivered one of my favorite Rock albums in recent history with their 2006 self titled album.  Their raw, energetic, retro sound had me blasting the album on many many occasions!<br /><br />Their 2nd album \\"Cosmic Egg\\" comes with high expectations to say the least.  2nd albums are often the make or break albums for many bands.  They now face the reality of a deadline, record label, tours, etc....<br /><br />But this album is great!!!!<br /><br />After 5-6 listens, not sure if it meets up to the first, but definitely a great album.  Starts off strong with \\"California Queen\\", \\"New Moon Rising\\", and continues strong with the \\"Beatle-esque\\" \\"In The Morning\\".  \\"Far Away\\" showcases are more commercial side, without sacrificing song quality.  This song has movie soundtrack written on it!<br /><br />Generally, this album is more \\"Rock\\" while the first is more \\"Heavy Rock\\".  Favorite picks are \\"10000 Feet\\", \\"Back Round\\".  Both have a Zeppelin feel going with some Deep Purple type keyboards.<br /><br />There are no weak moments on this album.  I predict their \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" will come on their 4th album.  In the meantime, enjoying the ride!<br /><br />8/10
0743496736|5.0|Earlier this year our high school book club chose to read \\"19 Minutes\\". Several high school teachers participated as well as some middle school teachers. The book was amazing. Many students that chose to read the book were reluctant readers but had heard so much about the book from other students that they decided to read it too. During the two meetings held to discuss this book, many valuable conversations took place. Some students said \\"How can people be so crule\\",or \\"I've felt bullied like this before.\\" Some students went as far to say that they new someone at school that might fit the shooters profile.  Simply a riveting book that should be a MUST read for all teachers. It really opened my eyes!!

0385737424|5.0|Wow! Reading this book has filled me with wonder! Oh, the possibilities that Rebecca Stead explores and the characters feel so real and flawed and loving and scared and vulnerable and...human.<br /><br />You know when they say a good book makes you feel like you've found family in those pages. That's how I feel. I've found family and as with any family, I found pieces of myself in every character.<br /><br />While the plotting is very tight, I was pulled more by the characters and the eloquence of the writing. Rebecca Stead's skill with words is light and heavy, playful and thoughtful, joyous and blue. Isn't that life?<br /><br />By the end, I bought every last detail coming together so nicely. That's difficult to pull off because most of the time, such endings feel contrived...forced. Because there is such a roller coaster of emotions, the ending also feels like ecstasy. I say that because while things are tied neatly, one has to then grapple with the larger themes of this wonderful children's novel, themes of loss, love, making mistakes, finding family, finding redemption, etc.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I won't because part of the joy in reading this book is allowing yourself to discover the mysteries of life.<br /><br />I know I certainly did!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Wonderful book.  I'm only halfway through it and can hardly put it down.  I'm hardly a teen, but I am enjoying this book very much.  A refreshing take on werewolves and teen love.  The parents are conspicuously absent (which bothers me in so many other YA novels) but in this book it's a plot point. Lyrical language, beautiful imagery, well-paced.  Read it!!
B002BFBAWO|4.0|The Bottom Line:    An endearing coming of age drama/slight comedy with Jesse Eisenberg in top form as Jesse Eisenberg, Adventureland is not the Superbad-like comedy that the commercials promised but it's all the better for it; a sweet movie that develops characters into believable human beings and eschews pratfalls in favor of earnestness and plot developments that feel organic to the material, Adventureland is quite a little movie.    3/4
B001E5FYS8|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Man on Wire isn't the best documentary ever made, but it tells an interesting story well (so well at times that it plays like a thriller during its climax) and features such a charismatic performance by Philippe Petit (as himself presumably) that it's no wonder it broke into the mainstream; I found the film a bit slow at times before its strong climax but have no qualms recommending this well-made and pleasant film.    3/4
B002OFWG7O|3.0|FIrst off, it's always disappointing that bands are required by their labels to release a greatest hits compilation, especially with such a great band as the Foo Fighters who have enough solid albums that they don't really need a greatest hits compilation.      This disc is great for people who want an introduction to the past decade + of Foo Fighters music but in all honesty, with the catalogue the Foo Fighters have, they should have had a double-disc Greatest Hits.  From this is missing the singles: Walking After You, I'll Stick Around (yeah I know the Foos don't care for it, but truth is, it was a single), For All The Cows, The One, Generator, Tired of You, Low, and No Way Back.    The bonus tracks are highly disappointing as I was pumped to hear them after the Foo Fighters website was promoting them as the Foos next giant arena rock tunes.    And the Everlong acoustic version is a bit unnecessary.  The best acoustic version of that song recorded was from the 2 Meter Sessions; I would suggest checking it out on Youtube if you've never seen it.    The Videography is nice and long sought after for my personal collection.  The Foo Fighters have always had fun and artistic videos to compliment their songs.    So yeah, overall, unless you're buying the Deluxe edition with the videography, the CD isn't really worth the time for true fans and might be worth it for new listeners!

B0015AARJI|5.0|For the sale price of $40, you can't beat this controller. I've used the xbox version, oversized in my opinion, but this controller fits easily into the hand and the perfect symmetry of the buttons is easy to learn. My wife thinks that the vibration feature is a gimmick, but I think it adds so much to the experience of playing games, even trivia games! But the most useful feature is the fact that they are bluetooth devices so you don't have to point them at the ps3, or even be in the same room to use them! Oh yes, and the swivel buttons can be used as a jog controller for your blu-ray or regular dvd playback. This is the controller to get.

B002UJIY70|4.0|The first thing that stands out about A Perfect Getaway (other than the bad choice of name for a horror movie) is the high calibur of actors they have in the lead roles. Milla Jovovich, Steve Zahn and Kiele Sanchez are all good here, but Timothy Olyphant steals the show. He was good in Deadwood, but failed to impress me as the baddie in the last Die Hard movie. He's cool, mysterious, creepy at times and delivers the best performance of his career in my eyes. Other than the well accomplished cast, the twist here is really good and elevated my review from three to four stars. It really works and will have you thinking about certain scenes in a whole new light. On the downside, it took 30 minutes or so for me to get into the characters and story. Maybe it was the mood I was in, but just make it through the slow start and you will get one heck of a middle and closing. It's more of a thiller than a horror film really, but there is some nice gore towards the end, so you get the best of both worlds. A Perfect Getaway is far from perfect as the title suggests, but it's a cut above most new horror films.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B002HWUU1I|5.0|Being a huge Frames/Swell Season fan, I've been anticipating this album for a long while now. I can say with a sigh of relief that I'm not disappointed. I really really enjoy \\"Strict Joy\\". I'd heard a lot of the songs live, and of course they are better than the studio versions, but it's not really fair to compare.    That being said, here is what I thought:    Low Rising - This is a very strong opening number. People say that it's really Van Morrisonesque, and I suppose that I'd agree with that. Glen's voice on this track is great, and it's got a great hook. My only problem with the song, is the production. I feel like it's been bogged down with too much drone. I think that the song would be better without the brass, and with more guitar. Still, a solid and catchy opening number. 8.5/10    Feeling The Pull - This is a great song. Very folky, with an old time optimistic feel. It's catchy, nicely written, and also it's very short and sweet. It retains the energy of Low Rising and focuses it in a very different way. I do however, miss the moments when played live Glen goes into a nice falsetto and lightly strums the guitar. However, the song is still great without it, and doesn't really suffer without it's inclusion. 8.5/10    In These Arms - Beautiful song, with beautiful lyrics. Glen's vocals are hushed, which makes the song sound almost like a lullaby. The harmonies and piano bits provided by Marketa are gorgeous. The songs beauty is in its simplicity. It's very clean, dark, and yet hopeful at the same time. Fantastic tune. 9/10    The Rain - This song to me, is very Frames reminiscent. It's dark, drum driven, has a prevalent bass part, and it makes nice use of the violin. It's a bit repetitive, but the song itself isn't that long, so you don't get a sense of a one minute song left on repeat. It's a nice tune, not one of the standouts, but by no means bad. 7/10    Fantasy Man - This is a Marketa driven song, and it's great. It has an old medieval feel to it, andalmost seems like it is a cover song from the olden days. The harmonies are fantastic, and really shows how wonderfully Glen and Marketa can blend their voices. Glen's part is very soft and understated, yet works extremely well. This song really shows off Marketa's talent. Her voice is like a warm fire on a cold rainy day. Very nice, soft, and welcoming. 9.5/10    Paper Cup - This song has very nice lyrics, and an almost Spanish-like feel to it, which is provided by the lead guitar. It's a soft song, and the lyrics while a tad bit sappy, work well and in no way sound cliched. It's a nice tune with a nice appeasing melody. 8/10    High Horses - The is by far the heaviest song on the album. It's a great throwback to The Frames, and sounds like it could have been off of one of their albums. The song becomes eerily quiet about 3/4 in, and then builds from there into a nice rocking ending. The effect is very nice, and it ends on a chilling note. 8/10    The Verb - This is by far one of my favorite songs on the album. Upon first listen, I wasn't sure if I liked it overall, but I was instantly drawn to the insanely catchy chorus. The more that I listened, the more I realized how layered and truly beautiful the song is. There are so many little aspects of the song that you do not catch on first listen, and the melody gets even more beautiful as the song continues. The climax of the song is met with Glen singing the chorus and being overlapped by Marketa singing her own thing, and the result is a gorgeous blending of melody and emotion that is like candy to the ears. 10/10    I Have Loved You Wrong - This song is so soothing, that you can't help but close your eyes and become engulfed in the music. The enchanting melody is only helped by the subtle instruments carrying the song along like a leaf on a gentle breeze. This is one of the best songs that the group has written, and Marketa's voice suits it perfectly. The song ends with a heartwarmingly angelic harmony between Marketa and Glen, and it is perhaps one of the most beautiful things that I've ever heard. One line is repeated many times, and with each repeat, you can feel it tugging more and more at your heart. 10/10    Love That Conquers - This song sounds like an old bardic folk song. It features some nice little harmonies, but the song overall tends to become a bit repetitive. However, the song is very nice. It's a great song to just relax and listen to. A very safe song with a simple yet nice tune. 7.5/10    Two Tongues - To me, this song also plays very much like a Frames song. I enjoy the chorus, and I like the buildup to it. However, on song like this, I wish that Glen would display the beauty and raw power of his voice, because he stays mostly in his lower register. The piano part on this track is very nice at times, and it pierces through the guitar like a sword, which is welcoming. 8/10    Back Broke - This song is a fantastic way to end the album. It's a quiet song with beautiful lyrics. It's song with Glen hardly using his voice, which makes it all the more effective. Additionally, Marketa's piano bits are very nice, and Glen's soft voice soars over them. The song has a wonderfully dark vibe, reminiscent to a storm cloud just before the rain. It ends the album on a very high note. 9.5/10    Overall, Strict Joy is a true work of art. It seems to me that Glen Hansard walked into the studio and came out with a hybrid album that lays somewhere between The Frames and The Swell Season. The result of such an album, is a wonderful gem that any musician would be proud to add to their catalogue. When the album flies, it really soars. Sure, it may hit some turbulence along the way, but the ride for the most part is an extremely enjoyable experience. The original poem Strict Care, Strict Joy, said \\"The poet makes grief beautiful,\\" and Glen and Marketa have truly achieved that. The album is a must-buy, and plays like a warm night sitting around the campfire with old friends playingmusic and telling stories. Buy the CD, close your eyes, and savor it.
B002ELM5HY|3.0|Mark and the musicians he's been working with for the last 13 years really know how to make music and produce a quality album. I'm looking forward to listening to this on a real high-end hifi system. The fact that he doesn't write songs as he did during the Dire Straits days doesn't bother me - I mean the man's just past 60. He's moved on, which is good.    One thing is that he's become older and more mellow, but what I feel this album lacks is grit. Or energy. Not high-octane rock n roll energy, but energy, if you know what I mean. And I think this is very much due to the slick and refined production. It would have been really interesting to let someone like Rick Rubin (remember the American recordings with Johnny Cash?) produce Mark. In my opinion, Mark has kind of stagnated and could really do with some outside input, or fresh ears if you like. Listening to the newer releases of Bob Dylan and Ry Cooder feels so much fresher and vibrant than what Mark makes these days.    Mark Knopfler is such a talented songwriter and guitarist, but he's become really boring. Get Lucky is a superb production, with superb quality, but it doesn't touch me.

0385504225|2.0|Long ago, Dan Brown published a book called Digital Fortress. I read it after having enjoyed DaVinci Code. That book was a real stinker. Dan has now created another real stinker in the Lost Symbol. Hardly the adventure for fans of Brown, this was a tedious read for most of the 500 pages. While all of his writing and characters are fairly simple, the stories and plots can grab you. I was totally absorbed by Deception Point, DaVinci Code and Angels&Demons. This new book is, unfortunately, not on par with those three.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|This series, translated from an Israeli prototype, takes us to the heart of psychotherapy. It stars Gabriel Byrne as Paul Weston, a somewhat rumpled and worn-out therapist, and six patients. Each 25-minute episode is a real-time view of a therapy session.<br /><br />The first patient is Laura, a sexy doctor about to split with her boyfriend who reveals in the first episode that she's in love with Paul. Next comes Alex, an African-American ace fighter pilot who accidentally killed 25 children in a school in Iraq. The most gripping patient is Sophie played wonderfully by Mia Wasikowska. She's a 15-year-old Olympic gymnast whose life has gone off the rails with a suicide attempt. Fourth are Amy and Jake, a couple whose marriage is falling apart. Finally, in the fifth episode, Weston seeks guidance and spars with Gina (Dianne Wiest), a former mentor with whom he has clashed in the past.<br /><br />We meet each of these characters nine times during the course of the season. Other peripheral characters -- Paul's unfaithful wife and kids, Sophie's mom -- occasionally drift into the action but basically we're stuck in Paul's cluttered office watching him fiddle with his glasses as his patients pour out their troubles.<br /><br />Occasionally, the translation from the Israeli-version strikes a false note. One anecdote is clearly drawn from the Holocaust. Transfering it to the South in the 1940s doesn't work. In another reference, one of the characters recalls the aroma of cakes baking on a Friday afternoon suffusing the apartment building of her youth. Yes, that happens in Israel on sabbath eve but not in America.<br /><br />At the end of this series, we learn that Paul is at least as screwed up as his patients and that psychotherapy often doesn't work. Only one of the patients makes real progress toward a recovery. The others either stew in their juices or get worse -- in one case much worse.<br /><br />Still, it's fascinating viewing, well-written and acted.
0385504225|5.0|What can I say that the book critics have not already said about this latest novel by Dan Brown? It is a truly spectacular read. For Masons, and particularly Scottish Rite Masons, this book will touch upon your experiences in the fraternity and make you truly proud of who you are and your choice to enter Freemasonry.  For many of you who do not know much about the Freemasons and what the organization is all about, this novel will clarify many misinterpretations that are floating around out there. Eye-opening for those unaccustomed to the fraternity; reaffirming for those within it.  Even outside the interest of Masonry, this novel is a great read: fast-paced and full of surprises.  Pick it up; you won't be disappointed.
B000P0J0A6|2.0|Poor writing, poor acting, predictible etc.  My main beef, though, is the scene where Phoebe Cates' character tells the story about how she found out there wasn't really a Santa Claus.  Be warned before watching this with young children.  I wish I had been!!
B001KVAMM4|5.0|Superb, superb, superb--this lady plays so well.  Watching the DVD gave me an even greater appreciation for her musical talent, the recording venue was beautiful, and the synergy with the other musicians was impressive.  Thoroughly enjoyed both the CD and the DVD, the CD is now one of my most frequently played.  If you either like classical violin, or are learning about/creating a classical music collection (like me)--definitly get this dual-media recording.
B0015FML06|5.0|I haven't listened to this CD is awhile and was very happy to hear it had been digitally remastered...I'm completely satisfied with my purchase and wouldn't hesitate to make another purchase from this seller...
B002NXSRW0|1.0|Having set my expectations fairly low going into \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" I still somehow managed to walk away disapointed.    More than any other big budget summer popcorn flick in recent memory-G.I. Joe is just completely relentless in its stupidity. From start to finish, it just never lets up. Scene after scene of \\"dumb\\" plays out in a carnival of bloated special effects (which look terrible by the way), cheesy one-liners, cliched action and idiotic dialog. And half way through the whole thing you just stop caring.

It's just that stupid.    **spoiler warning**    I can only imagine what a fit G.I. Joe fans everywhere are going to have with this film. It bears little to no resemblance what-so-ever to the cartoon series or any other Joe source material as far as I can tell. (Couldn't they have at least given the Baroness her trademark accent?)

B000UR9T8C|4.0|First of all, I was surprised as I read the reviews for Spiderman 3.  For years, it seemed to me as if everyone out there hated this movie.  I was wrong, it has received high marks by many reviewers, and I'm glad to see that.  Because the reality is while this film is not perfect, it is still a good one with excellent messages in it.  I think there are some people (and I'm not thinking of any Amazon reviewers, per se) who are so bent out of shape about certain aspects of this flick, like the way the character of Venom turned out for instance, that they miss the very important elements that are clearly evident in it.  That's why I have written this review, to highlight these clear messages, and to try to give viewers a new perspective on a movie that is sometimes unjustifiably maligned.<br /><br />For example, the topic of forgiveness is a very key theme in this film.  We all need forgiveness at one time or another and I don't think I ever remember seeing a Hollywood movie where forgiveness is so clearly presented to the viewer.  I'm tempted to reveal spoilers here to reinforce my point, but I'll refrain.  Suffice to say, this movie is worth viewing for no other reason than to see pure, undiluted forgiveness on display.<br /><br />Secondly, there are so many positive quotes that are true and profound.  For instance, at one point Peter says, \\"whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice.  It's the choices that make us who we are, and we can always choose to do what's right.\\"  Aunt May gives also two incredible lines.  At one point she tells Peter: \\"A man must be understanding and put his wife before himself.\\"  In another scene, she tells him, \\"Revenge is like a poison.  It can take you over and before you know it, turn us into something ugly.\\"  These are quotes that you sound like they should be in a devotional book or a sermon, not a Hollywood movie.<br /><br />Third, there's another clear message that comes screaming from the scenes of this movie nearly from beginning to end: romantic relationships are hard.  Again, I don't want to reveal too much, but Peter and Mary Jane go through incredible challenges in this film.  It makes me think about how some young people can sometimes idealize dating relationships.  There are some singles, for example, that refuse to be happy until they get into a relationship.  These people should be counseled that dating relationships can be very difficult, and Spiderman 3 can be used an illustration of this fact.<br /><br />In short, I recommend this movie.  There are great messages presented that we can use in our every day lives.s movie nearly from beginning to end: romantic relationships are hard.

B000VNMMR0|1.0|I really love Bruce Willis and his great action movies such as Last Man Standing. However, I did not like this one because his qoutes were bad, the action just way to explosive, and the story  not very challenging. For someone who likes to see exploding buildings and helicopters this movie might be the right one but for someone who wants to see the typical Bruce Willis sense of humor this is not the right choice. Sorry Bruce but your other movies were much more better.

B002OD2HVQ|5.0|I first heard of this movie through Robert Pattinson's affiliation with the film. After watching this film I became truly inspired...especially as a young homosexual who is struggling to show people that love has no limits and this includes the individuals' sexual orientation. I believe this film showed that you cannot choose who you fall in love with; love can be irrational, unkind, and painful, but what this film showed was that, yes, it is all of theses things, but it is also beautiful, and innocent, and limitless. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who is either questioning their sexual orientation or have questions regarding love and how it corresponds with homosexuality.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|It does look natural and stay put after you snap them on. I can't really say it totally changed the way games feel or anything, but now I'm hooked and can't play without them. when you open the packaging up you'll laugh at what you payed $5 for but if you need a stuffer item to reach the $25 free shipping mark it's totally worth it.
0446698342|4.0|Oh, Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.  I've been a fan for so long, reading each book you've offered up, year after year.  I feel like I've really gotten to know you, like I can I can finish your sentences, like I know how the book is going to end before you've finished telling the story.  Oh, wait...  That's not a good thing.<br /><br />Ok, yes, this was a decent story and I did enjoy it, but I couldn't help feeling like I was reading an inland version of Message in a Bottle.  I also struggled with the idea of the main character, Logan Thibault, walking from Colorado to North Carolina  -- not saying it can't be done, just that I can't quite wrap my head around someone actually walking that far.  I bet he was a big fan of The Proclaimers.<br /><br />As always, Sparks has woven a beautiful story of love between an unlikely pair...full of drama and sweet romance that, although perhaps almost too familiar and predictable by this point, always leaves me waiting for his next novel.<br /><br />I would recommend it to loyal Nicholas Sparks fans or people arriving late to the part.  For people who've read other novels from Sparks and weren't impressed -- there's nothing new to see here, move along.
B002NXSRW0|5.0|I expected to feel the same way about this movie that I did about the newer Transformers live action movies.  Decent mindless fun that isn't nearly as good or bad as the extremists on both sides claim.  Instead I was treated to something that was much better than I expected.  I think that it retained just the right amount of nostalgia to feel like it deserved to be called G.I.Joe, while at the same time being updated to modern storytelling.  The familiar characters were a delight to watch, especially everyone's favorite pair of ninjas Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow.  I really like what they did with the Cobra Commander for this movie too.  When it was over, I was left eager to see the eventual sequel and hope they get right on it.
B002SJIO5E|2.0|I think that this movie deals with some serious subject matter, but it never really culminated into anything tangible. A lot of fast camera shots and decent special effects. I still found myself wishing I was somewhere else, doing something else. 2 out of 5 stars from me.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This \\"documentary\\" discussed the other side of heath care, in the United States, in a way that we all know exists but have chosen to ignore.  While it is fairly one-sided, by giving all the pros and not many cons to socialized medicine, Moore does exactly what he intended to do (I think).  Made me think.
B001GCUNW6|4.0|I bought this version to get the digital copy for my iphone although I do not have a Blu-Ray player (since it includes a regular DVD copy of the movie as well...).  HOWEVER I cannot access the special features, because they are on the Blu-Ray disk.  I love the movie, but I'm VERY unhappy about:    1. Having to buy the Blu-Ray version in order to get the digital copy  2. Not having access to the Extras because they are on the Blu-Ray    Note - before pre-ordering this disk I did contact the studio store asking about a digital copy other than with the Blu-Ray and was NOT informed by them that the Special Features would be Blu-Ray. If I could at least access them on the regular DVD I'd be satisfied. Now I'm just irritated.    Regarding the film itself, I love it!  The irony of other reviewers complaining about dinosaurs being alive just makes me wonder... When is the last time you went to an animated film for reality and historical accuracy???   Problems with suspension of disbelief???  REALLY????  In an animated film with talking animals that never in reality were a herd together???  And the dinosaurs being alive is what they have a problem with???  ROFLMAO!!!    I think the story is wonderful, as is the animation.  Unlike the Shrek series which has not captured the magic of the first in the sequels, this 3rd in the Ice Age series is as enjoyable as the first (not quite as thrilled with the 2nd, but it is pretty good.)
B002BFBAWO|1.0|The only thing from the 80's this movie has, is the soundtrack. As a matter of fact, why the heck did the film makers decided to make it a period piece is beyond me. It could have easily taken place today. This movie was just plain bad! Very depressing as well. It should have been pushed as a drama over a comedy. The comedy that was in it was very lame and sleep inducing. Tom C.
0060574216|5.0|Who understands men or women in these crazy modern days? They're mostly degenerated, self-centred creatures who demand what they want from the other party all the time. No wonder everyone gets so frustrated.<br /><br />This guide draws on the complexities and differences in communication between men and women. It's goes beyond the usual paintbrush view that men are mostly logical and women, emotional. This book would be helpful for any modern day man or woman who find certain words and behaviors of the opposite sex puzzling. It tries to advise the 2 genders into taking a more compassionate view to your partner's behaviors and words and gain empathy. Hopefully, you'd also learn to hone keener and more attentive listening skills.<br /><br />I'll like to send this guide back through time, along with national marriage statistics, back to the Garden of Eden. Hopefully, Eve would read my package before she takes her first bite out of that fruit from the tree of knowledge. I'd also like to see this book be taught in schools.

Often I have had to open my window to hold the BU-353's outside the car on the roof and even then it often takes several minutes or even longer to get a signal on normal unencumbered roads in the countryside.  I therefore purchased a Navibe GM720 on a lark to see if it works better and the acquisition of satellite signals is unmeasurably superior.  I have even unplugged one and plugged in the other in comparative tests and the Navibe GM720 acquires a signal almost instantly while the GlobalSat BU-353 takes a long time and sometimes the program cycles out before acquisition.  I would be interested in knowing how different the circuitry is.  After all cheap Garmins seem to acquire and retain a signal in almost any condition so why shouldn't these USB models work just as well?    The one drawback of the GM720 is that its bottom is smooth and thus it slides all over the dashboard when my car turns quickly or accelerates.  The GlobalSat model has a rough sort of rubbery bottom surface that tends to prevent sliding around.
B0019PL2IO|5.0|Whenever you think of Jim Henson's Muppets, the fuzzy kooky variety shows and entertaining adventures of Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Kermit the Frog come to mind.<br /><br />But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in \\"The Dark Crystal,\\" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.<br /><br />On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.<br /><br />The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?<br /><br />Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in \\"The Dark Crystal\\" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.<br /><br />Instead of some pan-medieval land, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.<br /><br />Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.<br /><br />At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming). Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (\\"Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!\\") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Crystal\\" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet. Definitely a must-see.some pan-medieval land, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.

0141439513|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B001GCUNW6|4.0|The sub zero heroes are back for one really big adventure in the rousing animated feature \\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\". While Manny (Ray Romano) and Ellie (Queen Latifah) are anxiously waiting the birth of their baby, lonely Sid (John Leguizamo) discovers three large eggs that hatch into a trio of rambunctious baby dinosaurs. When their angry mother arrives and carries them to a mysterious underground world inhabited by towering dinosaurs, Manny, Ellie, Crash (Seann William Scott), Eddie (Josh Peck) and Diego (Denis Leary) find themselves at the bottom of the food chain and enlist the help of a deranged but courageous one-eyed weasel named Buck (Simon Pegg). Meanwhile, Scrat falls in love a with crafty sabre-toothed squirrel named Scratte. \\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" is certainly one of the most enjoyable summer movies of 2009. Though its story lacks some depth, the 94-minute animated film still offers plenty of humor and excitement for both adult and young audiences. The computer animation looks remarkably stunning.<br /><br />If you're looking for an amusing animated movie that looks terrific on Blu-Ray and includes numerous special features, then \\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" is a highly recommended purchase. The animated blockbuster looks outstanding but a 3-D option would have been a great bonus. The 7.1 DTS-HD audio is quite good but not as great as the video transfer. The Blu-Ray has a really good number of extras: audio commentary track by the filmmakers, several behind-the-scenes featurettes (Unearthing the Lost World, Buck: From Easel to Weasel & Falling for Scratte), a 2-minute music video, two animated shorts staring Scratt (Gone Nutty & No Time for Nuts) and two deleted scenes in their original storyboard format. Overall, \\"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\\" scores a \\"B+\\".

B0001Z52RU|3.0|After reading the viewer reviews about this movie, I'm convinced that those attracted to despair, futility, and ruination have a love affair with this adventure. Pedaphiles, doggie killers, baby bombers... it's all a bit much! Some complained about the perceived \\"upbeat\\" end of the film, although I didn't see the ending as upbeat at all.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert... Having the main character sacrifice the one relationship that meant the most to him...his true love, his childhood sweetheart... this is \\"upbeat?\\" Instead, it's bittersweet... he realizes that her life would be better if she wasn't close to him. Thus, this \\"good\\" ending has a sad twist, especially when he sees his true love on the street, but forces himself to keep walking away from her.<br /><br />If the ending had him \\"reconnect\\" with his lost love, that would had been inconsistent with the rest of the film. But the sacrifice of this time traveling protagonist, as kept in the film, fits well.<br /><br />The Director's cut has Kutcher's character strangle himself as a fetus? Please! I thought \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" was a depressing time travel film. If they kept this ending, Prozac could had officially sponsored the plunge into despair.
0385504225|1.0|Annoying characters and absolutely NO SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF.  Packed with references to symbols and origins of words but lacking in quality of plot.

Definitely not as good as Da Vinci Code or Angels & Demons.
B00243FQFA|5.0|Imaginative plots, cracking special effects that just get better, top notch scrapes and perils.<br /><br />Season highlights for me included:<br />1. Some more of Carson Beckett.<br />2. `The Daedalus Variations' - plenty of action and lots of tension.<br />3. `Ghost in the Machine' - great twists.<br />4. `The Shrine' - you know what's going to happen after the first five minutes but you still revel in the snappy interaction between the characters. David Hewlett really shows a different side to McKay here with some excellent acting. Very clever. Touchingly woven threads.<br />5. Dr. Daniel Jackson's return in a double episode. Powerful stories, thundering great bad guys. However, the promised banter between McKay and Jackson is not as clever as I'd hoped.<br />6. `Identity' - nice bit of confusion and plenty of toughing it out.<br />7. `Vegas' - very enjoyable character twists for Sheppard and McKay.<br />8. Nice to see some plausible romantic interludes.<br />9. Interesting special features on each disc.<br />10. Cool packaging. The single box works very well with two hinged disc holders.<br /><br />Why stop here? I've heard of quitting while you're ahead but even by Season 5, it seems like there's more to come than has already gone. There must be whole planet loads of potential in those space ship dwellers with the trixsy leaderene that Sheppard had the hots for but kept getting outwitted by. There must be a girl for Ronan somewhere - one that could punch him out if she had to but who likes him, too. The Genii? More Todd? This is not counting new bad guys we've not even seen yet. I hope a good quality straight to dvd movie and Stargate Universe will take the pain out of this being the last season.<br /><br />In summary: Season Five - it's all so good, I'm going to have to watch it again!
B00004STUL|5.0|Fun movie, you have everything from shoot um up bang bang, to explosions. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are great together and play off of each other very well.

And you would think that a company like Abundatrade would want to keep customers. Ohh well in any rate I got a copy from Block Buster here in town that is going out of buisness. I'm so glad that I found it here, I forgot that it really was a good movie.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|An epic mythological chopper saga but with a plausible science fiction theme. It was the SF aspect which appealed to me most; the gore, of which there is plenty, not so much. I'd have given four stars for less blood. Caviezel is at his enigmatic best. Sophia Myles is a treat, both visually and as a powerful female character. She plays the fiery daughter (Freya) of the Viking chief (ably portrayed by John Hurt) and she has any man she comes across reeling, literally. Rival chief Gunnar, played by Ron Perlman is truly terrifying in hammer-wielding battle mode and only slightly less fierce than the monster itself!<br /><br />The monster is all the better and more impressive, mysterious and scary for being only glimpsed and not fully seen until well into the film. This means that it benefits from the point of view that things scary are scariest when not seen, only imagined, and from being pretty fearful when it does finally appear. Possibly making reference to the `Alien' films, in one scene a monster drips saliva from glassy fangs onto Freya's cheek. Which brings me to special effects, here used in exactly the right proportion to generate the suspense and excitement required at the right moments, without being over-used or obtrusive.<br />More of what keeps the film moving, apart from the action, is the use of an inspiring sequence of locations: low earth orbit, desert planet landscapes, underwater, underground, and mist-shrouded forest with sunlight shafts stabbing through in anticipation of what is to follow. The SF special effects are excellent also and do a fine job of depicting an advanced civilization making a terrible error.<br /><br />Plot treats include: wily norseman captures well-armed starman, using his horse; the boy with the bread; and of course, `shields'.<br /><br />The film is well-paced and the entire narrative 'lavishly envisioned'. The costumes and weaponry are spot on for creating atmosphere.<br /><br />Finally, the bonus features are excellent, especially the deleted scenes. Although I can understand why some of the scenes were cut to maintain the momentum, they are particularly worth watching because they add humanity and soul to the story.<br /><br />A breath-taking action ride. Incredible it wasn't widely distributed at the cinema, watch it now!though I can understand why some of the scenes were cut to maintain the momentum, they are particularly worth watching because they add humanity and soul to the story.

B002P6TA94|5.0|This album is a must for any classic rock enthusiast.  Wolfmother has a presence that no other band from this time period can even begin to compete with.  This album is just as good as if not better than their first album that was self-titled.  You can definitely hear their influences coming out in their music, but it just makes for better listening.  You might have to listen to the album through a time or two, but it ends up growing on you until it's almost impossible to get some of the songs out of your head.  I would highly recommend this cd and I would also highly recommend seeing them live.  Their live performances are absolutely amazing.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child and was thrilled to see it on Blu-Ray.  It looks as good as one could expect considering it's age.  It also has some wonderful extra features.  It has the behind-the-scenes featurette that was on the DVD; but it also has an additional 'making of' documentary, a picture-in-picture track featuring interviews with puppeteers and puppet makers, and a commentary by Brian Froud.  A great addition to any Blu-Ray collection!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Oh my god. This CD is outstanding! My fave album of all time! A perfect display of the iconic Avrils talent. The lyrics on this album are very emotional and introspective! The BEST song from Avril is on this album: My Happy Ending: a song which showcases not only Avrils lyrical ability but also her vocal ability. It is a radio-ready hit which will not dissapoint. A very powerful song indeed which will not grow old. Another standout hit (although, bearing in mind - all the tracks are amazing) is Fall To Pieces. A truely wonderful love song which encompasses great vocal performances from Lavigne. Together is another powerful rock-out song which represnts everything Avril lavigne is stereotyped for portraying.     All up - the best CD I've ever listened to. You can sense the emotion in the tracks and relate and empathize with what she's talking about. All lyrics are beautifully crafted alongside catchy guitar-piano chords to make an introspective AND sing-along album for fans to play on repeat!
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**<br /><br />In his early days, after he gave up writing comedies such as 'Bananas' and 'Sleeper', Woody Allen desperately anted to join the ranks of the world's great directors such as Ingmar Bergman and Federico Fellini. He churned out pretentious drivel such as \\"Interiors\\" in an attempt to emulate his beloved Bergman but deep down he always knew that he could never approach the great director's depth. So he turned to a mixture of romantic comedy and his own brand of 'art house fare' in the films that made him famous: 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' and 'Hannah and her Sisters'. Unfortunately, until the impressive \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\", he was never able to muster enough sympathy for his characters to make them credible enough or engaging. There was always that flash of arrogance underneath the surface that Allen was unable to hide; he was always one step above his characters, looking down on them rather then striking the necessary balance between sympathy and contempt.<br /><br />At a certain point, Allen threw up his hands and decided for awhile that maybe he should go back to his strong suit as an 'entertainer'. He churned out fluff pieces such as 'Bullets over Broadway' and 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' but made one last attempt at joining the great directors' pantheon with \\"Deconstructing Harry\\", another failed attempt to emulate Bergman. Allen floundered until 2005 when he came out with 'Match Point' which marked a welcome move to the mainstream. No longer starring in his own films and filming in England, Allen decided that he no longer had to prove to the world that he was the next Fellini or Bergman. Up until the unconvincing climax, 'Match Point' was a taut drama chronicling the machinations of a lower-class retired tennis pro as he manipulates family members in an upper class milieu.<br /><br />Vicky Christina Barcelona is content to examine all strictly middle class characters from both sides of the Atlantic. Before Allen shows us the 'dark' side to his characters, he wisely builds sympathy for them. Both Vicky and Christina are adventurers. Vicky, the more conservative of the two, is extremely skeptical of Juan Antonio's proposal to fly in his private plane for a weekend of wild abandon in a picaresque Spanish town. Her skepticism and conservative nature are her strong points. Christina, in contrast, believes in taking chances without thinking about the consequences so she convinces Vicky to accept Juan Antonio's proposal. While Christina often acts recklessly, her desire for freedom often leads her to new, interesting experiences which the average person would never dream of entertaining.<br /><br />Juan Antonio, the suave Lothario, who sees nothing wrong in seducing as many women as he can, also has many likable attributes. Not only is he a 'smooth operator' but he has that 'senstive side' that women are drawn to. Vicky finds Juan Antonio's proposition to visit his father his \\"first genuinely interesting proposition\\". Juan Antonio's startling account of why his father won't share his poetry with the world draws Vicky to him. Juan Antonio's ex-girlfriend, the volatile Maria Elena, can hold her own with her ex in regards to creative pursuits. Not only does Juan Antonio claim that his strength as an artist can be attributed to Maria Elena but she is genuinely helpful to Christina when she teaches her how to become an accomplished photographer.<br /><br />The plot of VCB never bores. The break into Act II occurs when Juan Antonio takes Vicky and Christina on a wild weekend. Up until the midpoint there are many twists: Christina becomes sick right before making love; Juan Antonio's seduction of Vicky; Doug's proposal to get married first in Spain and his arrival and Christina's decision to move in with Juan Antonio.<br /><br />The midpoint marks escalating tension. This is when Maria Elena attempts suicide and moves in with Christina and Juan Antonio. More twists and turns occur in thesecond half of Act II: Maria Elena's terrible jealousy toward Christina; The revelation of Juan Antonio's infidelity which led to Maria Elena attacking him; Vicky's confession to Ben that she doesn't know why she's attracted to Juan Antonio; Judy's affair with Doug's business partner and her misguided encouragement of Vicky in continuing the affair with Juan Antonio; Christina's decision to leave the m&eacute;nage a trios and Maria Elena and Juan Antonio's dispiriting breakup.<br /><br />Woody Allen does a much better job with his climax than in Match Point since Maria Elena's 'crime of passion' is more believable than Chris, the ex-tennis pro's foray into full-blown murder.<br /><br />Just as he views his characters with sympathy, Woody Allen doesn't hesitate to criticize them. Vicky admits that her husband Doug is a wonderful guy, someone who she's always wanted but cannot throw off her irrational attraction to Juan Antonio. Even at the end, she's about to be seduced by Juan Antonio AGAIN but is brought back to reality when Maria Elena's gun goes off and she sustains a flesh wound to her hand. Christina seems naturally drawn to vacuous affairs. Even at the beginning, she's telling Juan Antonio she'll go up to his room but \\"you'll have to seduce ME\\". She's also a bit arrogant when she tells him, \\"You're home free, unless you blow it\\". Christina never knows \\"what she wants\\" but does know \\"what she DOESN'T want\\".<br /><br />Juan Antonio seems to go from one woman to another but is unable to make a commitment. His narcissism seems to always lead to bad feelings of jealousy amongst the various women he seduces. And of course Maria Elena is the ultimate narcissist in that she can't accept others unless they give her 100% loyalty.<br /><br />The overuse of the narrator in VCB is perhaps the film's major flaw. One wonders why Woody Allen doesn't trust his audience to draw its own conclusions. Nonetheless, VCB marks a comeback of sorts for Woody Allen. It's a perceptive and critical look at European and American sensibilities regarding relationships and how they can go awry.jealousy toward Christina; The revelation of Juan Antonio's infidelity which led to Maria Elena attacking him; Vicky's confession to Ben that she doesn't know why she's attracted to Juan Antonio; Judy's affair with Doug's business partner and her misguided encouragement of Vicky in continuing the affair with Juan Antonio; Christina's decision to leave the ménage a trios and Maria Elena and Juan Antonio's dispiriting breakup.

B001AVCFJM|1.0|I am, it must be said, only a casual fan of \\"Star Trek\\" in that I thoroughly enjoyed watching the original series on TV, and the films which featured the original cast, and largely despised the \\"Next Generation\\" and the rest of it's tedious, politically correct ilk. That said, lest I sound like too much of a curmudgeon, let me state for the record that a big-screen reboot of the original series made with intelligence, style and affection - say along the lines of a [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition)]] or a [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]] - would have been most welcome.     Unfortunately, that didn't happen and J.J. Abram's \\"Star Trek\\" is such a catastrophic misfire of a film that it's almost impossible to begin sifting through the wreckage in order to ascertain where it all went so horribly wrong. Suffice it to say, if you want a textbook example of how NOT to go about reviving a television and film franchise, then this film is it.    So how did he screw it up so badly?    Well, for a start, He completely disregarded the canon of the original series; decided to film a script with so many plot and credibility holes that it could double as a hunk of Gorgonzola; and, by his own admission, embraced a film-making sensibility that was the polar opposite of the franchise concept in order to try and hook an audience that apparently suffers from attention deficit disorder and a low IQ.    Largely though, you can ascribe the failure of this film to a case of misguided intent and having the wrong director at the helm.    After all, when the first question on a director's mind when attempting to reboot \\"Star Trek\\" is \\"what can we learn from Star Wars here?\\" (as is established in a behind-the-scenes extra on the DVD) then you've pretty much instantaneously established that you've got the wrong man for the job.     \\"Star Trek\\" is not \\"Star Wars\\". People do not want \\"Star Trek\\" to be \\"Star Wars\\". If they want to watch \\"Star Wars\\" thenthey can go and watch \\"Star Wars\\".    I could go into myriad incidental details about what is bad about this film - the nauseating product placement; the irritating \\"camera flare\\" lighting; a \\"Death Star-esque\\" planet killing Macguffin that looks like a giant ball of Edam; the fact that the deck of the \\"Enterprise\\" looks like the interior of an iphone shop and that the engine room looks like the floor of a brewery - but they are not really the problem.    The fundamental problem with this film is that, cosmetic similarities aside, it is not \\"Star Trek\\" in any way, shape or form.     Whilst watching [[ASIN:B00005JLF3 The West Wing - The Complete First Season]], recently (a series which is the antithesis of this film in that it is brilliantly written, intelligently plotted and well-acted), a quote from Martin Sheen pretty much managed to sum up the feelings this film left me with. The quote in question - which makes explicit President Jed Bartlet's response to the question of whether his administration should be giving tacit support to a film-maker who makes gratuitous, bad films - is along the lines of, \\"Why not? Nothing I do will really make a difference. Hollywood will only stop making crappy films when people stop paying to see them\\".     My other half and I paid all of $3 to rent this DVD and still felt ripped off the following morning. Suffice it to say, we will be heeding Bartlet's dictum from hereon out and refusing to pay even one cent to rent, buy or watch a film of this quality ever again.
141041986X|5.0|On the advice of a fellow YA writer, I read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. One word--awesome.<br /><br />Katniss lives in a society that is divided into districts, each defined by the products it provides. She's from District 12--a poor, coal-mining area, and she's from the low end of that. She's forced to hunt illegally to feed her family, alongside her best friend, Gale. Her father has been killed in a coal-mine explosion, her mother is emotionally cut-off, and her little sister is the light of her life.<br /><br />When her sister's name is chosen for participation in a brutal, fight-to-the-death competition between districts, Katniss volunteers to take her place.<br /><br />The story is full of action, suspense, and deep emotion. I could not put this book down. I was completely caught up in Katniss's character, and I felt every moment of her experiences. Suzanne Collins' writing is masterful.<br />There is violence, of course, but it's not overboard. No sex, no cussing. But gobs and gobs of intensity.<br />Awesome. Really, really. A total must-read.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|needless to say more.. BSB have shown that no matter what the media say about them they're amazing vocalists and performers on everything they do. This is a clear example of that, even if this album is a lot different than what we're used to hearing from them once again you can enjoy the harmony of their voices in more upbeat songs. still maintaining their quality.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|Song selection is great, Sting's vocals aren't so much. He sounds like he's gargling. For a better version of \\"Soul Cake,\\" look for \\"Souling Song\\" by Chuck Beard and Dan Leonard, on the CD \\"Christmas Comes Again\\" (on iTunes).
B002OVEB5S|5.0|This is one of the best Slayer recordings. There are actual songs here and a little diversity in the songwriting. It flies by on the player because it is that good from front to back. Buy it!!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I actually pre-ordered the hard-cover version of this book and paid full price for it ... and I have no regrets.  Dan Brown has done it again and this, along with the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons soars head and shoulders above Digital Fortress.  It's as twisted and history-meets-theory enriched as the rest with a new, compelling and equally creepy villain to match.  I was slightly disappointed to find far fewer puzzles to be solved in this book, with the others I enjoyed pausing during the read to try and figure out the puzzle or clue before Langdon and his sidekick of the hour could do it for me.  In this novel there were really only one or two puzzles to be solved but the eye opening inclusion of interesting scientific studies briefly cusped in this tomb has led me on a path of insatiable reading pleasure long after I closed the Lost Symbol and placed it in its new home upon my shelf.<br /><br />Well worth the price I paid and by far worth the cost of the kindle version.
0307455874|1.0|This autobiography is extremely boring! Considering President Obama has a very short career and extreme limited experience why should I have expected more?
B001AQTWF2|1.0|Bought this with high expectations.....Was very disappointed in this cd.....it is all dribble...What has happened to her voice? Wow it seems to me that her career is OVER! and all due to her crack addiction! I have listened to this, tried to like it, but my mind keeps wandering to other cds i want to listen too. This is a cd that was a waste of studio time and whitneys.......i give this cd one star!
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Just caught them on tour with Dethklok and the new album sounds AWESOME live!!!  I was really impressed.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Slayer is like a fine wine, they get better with age. This album is excellent. This album has the influences of all their past albums. The music and the writing sound like they still have the fire and desire, they sound like they're 18 years old again. From start to finish each song is a classic. This album sounds fresh and new, it's still the same Slayer we all know and love, except they kicked it up a few notches. They play with so much energy you can feel it through your body.  The production is excellent, Tom sings with such passion and conviction, kerry's guitar playing is better than ever, hanneman's guitar playing compliments king's playing. They are the best one - two  punch in the business. And I can't say enough about dave lombardo, He is so under rated. HE IS ON POINT, HIS DRUMS IS BETTER THAN EVER ON THIS ALBUM.  You can tell they took thier time with this album, They did everything right. This album is one of thier best. Even better than their last two releases. All in all, this is a Must have. I give it 10 stars

B001TH16DI|4.0|I just got this and haven't finished ST 1 yet but this is what I have noticed.  Some scenes look great while others not so great.  In the beginning where the Enterprise is leaving spacedock there are a few big black spots that appear on the enterprise and I mean BIG.  I can't beleive that these were allowed in the transfer.  Also, when the Entperise has entered V'Ger and Kirk tells Sulu to take them 500 meters above and 200 meters out there are three smaller black spots on all the outside shots of the enterprise in the scene.  When they go to interior shots they look ok.  The other thing I have noticed is that when a character is the main focus visually for a scene, almost everything outside of the focus is highly blurry.  Not sure if this is the same on the VHS and DVD releases.  I'm gonna check this but it is kind of annoying.    As for the movie itself, by not including a lot of the extra scenes the movie seems to jump and not make sense at some points.  Also, the deleted scenes are included as extras but not all the extra scenes from the directors cut made it to the deleted scenes section.    Once I see more, I'll review more.
B00005ASOC|5.0|As mentioned in my title, people can see a well acted and wholesome movie and be rewarded by the positive messages that are provided within the scenes.  Good illustration of people struggling with their handicaps.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|Well, this show is great. It's written by the guys that wrote The Shield, so straightaway you know it's going to be good. What can I say, rock music, bikes, fights and gangsterism, this has it all. I do think there could be more in the extras, and some of the Irish accents are, awful, but maybe not as noticeable for you lot in the USA. I live in Northern Ireland, and so I noticed them.  Blu ray is great, some of the scenery when the guys are out and about is good. I hope this shows runs for years.
1439102813|5.0|Excellent book.  Easy read and very uplifting.  Good insight into a disease many people are dealing with.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This movie was very colorful I got the version with the blu ray and the dvd . I dont have a blu ray player yet so was unable to see alot of the special features. I feel like they should have put more special features on the dvd version. If you liked the original, you would like this one just as well or better because of the brighter colors.
B002NXSRW0|1.0|This movie started with a good idea.    Thats it.  The acting was horrible.  The script was horrible.  They tried to tie in the original cartoon sayings.    This movie was worse then the Hulk remake by Ang Lee.
B000QUEQBS|4.0|OUTSTANDING EXCAPE MOVIE.  HAD THE ORIGINAL IN DVD FORMAT AND PURCHASED THE BLUE-RAY VERSION SO I COULD ENJOY THE EVENT BETTER.
B002GU5V24|4.0|Apart from the contents of the product. Which are fantastic. I must complain about that the DVDs aren't Region Free. It doesn't make any sense that in a globalised world we live in, it still there are barriers to buy and sell across the planet.     It is known that many people will simply download this contents from the internet, without paying any money and making a great damage to the record industry. I think that companies like Amazon.com should make an effort to change this, using their influence to the records companies, in this case \\"Rhino\\", to release their music DVDs without this limitations.
0810993139|5.0|My 6th grader checked this out at school.  She doesn't like to read that much, but she loved this book. She stayed up late one night to finish it, so I picked it up to see what it was about.  I flipped to the middle of the book and read about 20 pages before putting it down (only because I had to get ready for work).  This book is hilarious.  Great narration. Wonderful drawings. A loveable character.  What more could you ask for.  I was upset she had to return it to school the next day and that I couldn't finish it.  I'm happy to know there are more books and I will definitely be getting her the rest.
B001EL6EH2|1.0|As a Casablanca fan, I wanted the best DVD version possible. I consequently ordered the Blu-ray version expecting a substantially improved version as compared to earlier releases.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  The Blu-ray version is not noticeably better than the earlier versions.  For someone who has an earlier version, I seriously question whether it is worth spending the money on the Blu-ray version.  For someone who does not have an earlier version, it is a judgment call as to whether is worth getting the additional materials.
B002OVEB5S|1.0|I've been a HARDCORE Slayer fan since I was 12. I'm 31 now. I have every single album they have ever put out. I've seen them live 8 times. I listened to this album today (the day it came out in the U.S.) and wasn't too let down, because, well, Slayer has been deteriorating for years now. I wasn't expecting much, but this album was even worse that I thought it was gonna be.     There is nothing new or inspiring here. Sounds like Slayer just wanted to make some more money so they put a CD out. Every song follows the same formula that they seemed to have adopted when they put out \\"God Hates Us All\\".   Predictable guitar solos, boring guitar riffs and Tom just screaming with no emotion in his voice. They should have just quit after putting out \\"Divine Intervention\\". Instead they have just put out one bad album after another. Don't bother with this album. Stick to the older ones.
0385504225|2.0|Like The DaVinci Code, this book makes a great My First Mystery for folks who aren't familiar with the genre.  Brown knows his audience well: the naive and gullible, and feeds them mysteries that aren't very mysterious, and puzzles that those familiar with mystery books will soon figure out.  He doesn't write especially well, but the book is more of the same for those who liked the first two books, plus his computer novel.  If you loved DaVinci code, you'll probably like this.  But it won't inspire any clue tours around the Nation's capital.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|You already know that the music is brilliant.  I wanted to take a minute to tell you that the presentation of this box set, from the box to the booklets, is as great as the music.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown once again proved why he has legions of adoring fans who eat up everything he writes: he is an absolute master of weaving together intricate puzzles, based on various ancient mythologies and symbolism, that almost always have multiple layers.  Unfortunately, it seems he has spent all of his time weaving these puzzles and then not enough time learning how to write.  I know, I know, \\"It's just for entertainment.  You shouldn't criticize his writing, since he's not trying to be Victor Hugo.\\"  Fair enough...I have read all the Langdon books and will read the next one, for that exact reason.  It's entertaining, and I like the puzzles.  That doesn't mean I can't criticize his writing style.  I find myself holding my nose while reading his books, then genuinely enjoying the 25% or so in which puzzles are actually being solved.    A few main criticisms:    1.) Entirely too much use of italics.  Not only are all the character's thoughts italicized, but virtually every sentence that they speak has a few italics thrown in for emphasis.  People just don't talk like that in everyday speech.  2.) His characters sound like encyclopedias.  Way too many passages where I feel like I'm sitting in a lecture hall.  3.) Virtually every chapter ends on a cliffhanger.  His writing is bad enough (see point 8) that that's about the only way he can keep people turning the page to see what happens next.  Not only do the chapters all end on cliffhangers, but there are numerous places where the characters have already been made privy to some secret information which, for some reason, is withheld from the reader.  That's just annoying.  If you want to put off the secrets for a little longer, don't reveal them to all the main characters.  4.) He plays very loose with facts.  I know it's fiction.  And that's fine.  But there are inexcusable factual errors in here that could be cured with a simple Googling.  More than that, they are things that any semi-educated person (as Brown presumablyis) should know without having to Google.  I don't want to spoil it, but I'll just say that there's a certain government agency that dramatically oversteps its legal authorities, and no one even notices.  Maybe you can respond that it was just going rogue and knew it was out-of-bounds but didn't care.  Well...it doesn't come across that way.  And it doesn't appear that Brown has any clue how wrong he got it.  If he did, then his highly-educated protagonist would have at least had an italicized thought along the lines of \\"Hey, they aren't suppose to be doing that.\\"  The problem could have been fixed with a simple \\"search and replace,\\" in MS Word.  He also takes what are, at best, fringe beliefs and promotes them as fact.  Sorry Dan, but the word \\"Amen\\" is not derived from the name of \\"Amon Ra.\\"  A cursory internet search will show that this is a myth with no academic backing.  Langdon would know that.  If you're going to present fringe beliefs as true, at least have your uber-booksmart protagonist identify them as fringe beliefs.  Then, if you want, have them turn out to be true, to your protagonist's utter shock.  5.) Noetics.  Give me a freaking BREAK.  This is one of the most utterly vacuous ideas around, ranking right up there with astrology and Scientology.  Okay, this isn't a criticism of his writing, so much as my rant about the fact that the enormous popularity of Brown's books is going to spark public interest in this \\"science.\\"  If Katherine Solomon presented her \\"research\\" to any reputable academic publication or at a major university, she would be laughed back into obscurity where she belongs.  The book tries to defend itself against this criticism by saying that \\"round earthers\\" used to be laughed at.  Yeah, maybe.  But you know what the difference was?  They had actual evidence to support the idea that the earth was round.  It's called circumnavigation.  It's the fact that the sail is the last part of a ship to disappear over the horizon.  If the history of science shows one thing, it's that it accepts new ideas when they have evidence.  Scientists are perhaps the one group of people on earth who can be generally trusted to discard former prejudices when the facts illustrate that they were wrong.  It is overwhelmingly common in science...politics and religion, not so much.  It happened with evolution.  It happened with relativity and quantum mechanics.  Ideas that would have been considered absurd by earlier generations were proven because, once they became testable, the evidence was conclusive.  People have been obsessed with finding hidden powers in the human mind for centuries.  The reason scientists laugh at such absurdities is because, after centuries of trying, no one has produced anything coming close to evidence for ESP or telekinesis.  In fact, there have been studies done of \\"the power of prayer\\" which pretty conclusively proved that sick people who receive prayers don't tend to get better quicker than those who don't receive prayers.  The worst thing about this book is that it will result in a surge in popularity in yet another indefensible form of vacuous nonsense.  As if we needed any more than we already have.  6.) The book is essentially a fractal pattern.  The entire story consists of repeated examples of Langdon taking the skeptic's view of a situation, only for someone to pull a magic act and show that, \\"gasp! there really is something mystical and literal behind this weird old legend after all!\\"  Then, towards the end, we find that these repeated examples are really just building up to another example that is the sum of all previous examples.  7.) The \\"grave threat to national security\\" is an absolute joke.  At worst, it would destroy the political lives of a few people who probably should never have been voted into office in the first place.  8.) The writing is beyond bad.  It's almost apocalyptically bad.  The screenplay to Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure looks like Shakespeare by comparison.  At least that movie was intentionally corny.  Brown's language is corny and hilarious, but not intentionally so.  I had to wear earplugs and hold my nose just to make it through the conversations that the characters hold with each other.  Even then, my mouth tasted like I had just eaten brussel sprouts.  A bit of advice for Brown.  It is perfectly okay to use a an awe-insipring noun, a extremely old verb, or a legendary adjective without famously modifying them by using luxurious adjectives and erudite adverbs.

B002C6K7N0|4.0|i've only listened to this thing a few times but it's definitely a continuation of the theme and vibe of UNITED ABOMINATIONS.  dave is still pissed at the ways of the world and the album breathes some serious hellfire.  i can't say i like HEADCRUSHER much (juvenile and rather gross really) but most of the cuts are razor-sharp and sport great riffs, time-changes, lyrics, etc.  if you've been on board the M'deth train this long, no reason to get off yet.

0385504225|1.0|I have really enjoyed Dan Brown's novels up to this point, maybe some of the plots were a bit far fetched, but not impossible.  This book is not only implausible, but silly and way beyond possible!  I feel like a bunch of ridiculous \\"facts\\" were thrown at me in contrived situations just because the author could write most anything at this point and have a best seller.  I wondered most of the time if he even had an editor and if he did had he graduated from grade school.  Some of the characters were so silly and situations so out there I wanted to scream and throw this book across the room, I think I did once, scared my dogs to death.  If you want to know how bad a follow up can be by all means read this book, it is not worth the $9.99 though, get it from the library or off the street where someone like me has tossed it out the window in frustration!

0810983915|5.0|by OBP<br /><br />  I just want to say that Jeff Kinney is the best author ever!! I was psyched when I bought Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days. I started reading as soon as I got in my mom's car. I couldn't put it down until 9:23 pm, which is 23 minutes past my bedtime. I read the whole book from cover to cover and didn't stop until I finished it. My favorite part was when Greg showed Rowley his high score on Thunder Volt and saw the name of the person who got the next highest score: Is An Idiot. That made me laugh out loud. Although I know that Greg Heffley is not an idiot. I think it's pretty goofy that he thought a severed muddy hand was out to get him. I'm sure that no one else but my sister would believe that. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days is, without a doubt, the best book I have ever read in my life. I just have one thing to say to Greg: Don't listen to Rodrick; he's full of baloney.

B0024RIMBG|5.0|Extraordinary.  The Celtic Women at their best.  This will be an excellent reminder for those of you who have seen their show in Toronto few years ago.  The decor is almost the same despite the fact that, in Slane Castle, the show takes place outside in what seems to be a beautiful night. I particularly enjoyed Mairead, the fiddle female Elf for whom gravity is just a word or so it seems.  She is so light, so fairy like.    Off course, the rest of the troop, singers and musicians, is great too.  Without them, the show wouldn't be what it is, Excellent.    One can never go wrong when buying their music in whichever form.  But, seeing them, is such a delight.    Nora, Toronto ON Canada
B00005JLEX|4.0|Seinfeld was such an important part of American popular culture of its day that one might reasonably assume that the series is thoroughly tied to its time.  In fact--perhaps because it was the \\"show about nothing\\"--it remains vital today.  Seinfeld really hit its full stride after a few years went by, so this set is fun, entertaining, but not as consistently \\"on\\" as the episodes from later in the history of the show.  What's interesting is to see the character development and to see how the audience begins to \\"get\\" who the characters really are below the surface.  Worth purchasing!

B00288KNL8|5.0|Got it at Target, didn't know much about it beforehand but it looked interesting. Watched it with the kids (almost 4 and almost 2) and they loved it. The next day the older one even wanted to watch it again. It's the perfect level of scariness for toddlers/preschoolers, but adults won't be scared. A little creepy at times, maybe, but nothing that will traumatize them, especially if you are right there watching it with them. We went to the coraline web site and our daughter loves the create-a-flower game. Seeing on the website some photos and videos of how it was made might make it more fun for your kids. The single disc version has virtually no extras (and as a collector I LOATHE dual-sided discs).
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I kept track of the evolution of this movie.  At first it was just going to be some 45 minute OAV, then what i call a Disney-length movie (about 72 minutes), and I never took it seriously as a movie.  I thought it was just a sad attempt at making money off the fans.  Then they extended it out to a full-length movie, and i got excited.  I saw it.  It was a fun ride, but it kinda left me dazed and confused.  I knew the story of FF7 (though i had never finished the game), at least enough to know what was going on in general, but this story seemed like an excuse for the action that took up more than half the movie.  It was rushed, the whole movie looked very gray and depressing, the transitions were very rough, and a bunch of other small nitpicky things annoyed me.  I think i gave the original cut 5 stars at the time, but in retrospect, it was more of a 4.  High marks for the animation being far beyond what we get in America for direct-to-DVD, and for the action being so wonderfully insane that it made my eyes tired.<br /><br />This release deals with the big issue that kept the original cut from being a real movie and not just a movie for FF7 fans.  The story.  They really fleshed it out, and instead of trying to pick up where the game left off and continue that story, the additions have served to finally give this its own story (and one that fits the title much better).  And like any decent movie based on a story told in another media (Serenity), you don't have to know what happened before, but there are obviously things that will be more significant to those that do, but mostly in a nostalgic sense.  The pacing is also a lot better, so it doesn't feel so rushed.<br /><br />They've added more than just talking though.  Many of the action sequences have been extended and revamped, including the final duel (which definitely pushes this above the PG-13 rating of the original cut).  There are a few more location shots here and there which are easy to miss, but help with the pacing.  And this cut seemed more colorful.  It's still pretty gray, but things like Cloud's shirt looking blue, and Vincent's cape now being bright red seemed to pop out at me.  It also seems like the characters actually look beaten, bruised, and dirty during the fights, and i don't remember it being done quite so obviously before.<br /><br />The only thing that bugged me about this is that it's only on Blu-Ray (i just got a PS3, so i finally got to see this) and that you can tell how old some of the sequences are (early in the movie's development, after they decided to do a full-length movie, new footage for Complete).  But that's because they've been working on this for so long.  I noticed that in the original cut.  But unless you're as visually picky as me, it won't bug you too much.<br /><br />So with all the additions, big and small, and even with it's shortcomings, Advent Children is finally a real movie to me.  And it now earns a full 5 stars from me beyond all doubt.this cut seemed more colorful.

B002NXSRVG|5.0|Movie makers are always looking for sources to create films from. More so than that, they're looking for movies that can become franchises, turning a single film into a multi-million dollar money making machine. Sometimes they do so at the cost of a good film resulting in the franchise dying. Other times they make a movie that does so well, that hits all the right notes, that they have a sure fire hit. Such is the case with G.I.JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA.<br /><br />Based on what was first a toy from Hasbro and then a hit TV cartoon series, the creators here led by director Stephen Sommers (of THE MUMMY fame) have transformed those original ideas into a fantastic action film. When the term pulse pounding action is used, this is the movie you should think of.<br /><br />The film opens in the past with a weapons developer and a look at the McCullen clan founder whose current descendant James (Christopher Eccleston) has just turned over a new weapon to U.N. This weapon uses nanomites, nearly invisible robots, to destroy and eat metal. Leading the convoy transporting the weapons is a top Special Forces team led by Duke (Channing Tatum).<br /><br />Attacked by a secret villainous team led by the Baroness (Sienna Miller), an ex-flame of Duke, the team (or what's left of it) is rescued by an elite group known as G.I. Joe, led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Sticking with his orders, Duke and fellow team mate Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) stay with their package.<br /><br />Arriving at the Joe's secret headquarters, they request to join the team and are given the chance once it becomes known Duke knows the Baroness. After a brief training period, they become part time members. But a tracking device on the weapons case switched on by McCullen has led his team to the Joe base and they attack using both special operatives infected with the nanomites and martial arts expert Storm Shadow (Byun-hung Lee) with the Baroness.<br /><br />The weapons taken, Gen. Hawk wounded, the team goes into full blown rescue mode as they track the weapons to France. With the help of super powered armor that enhances all abilities (as well as containing some high tech fire power), the team tries to reclaim the weapons before they can be used. They fail and (as seen in previews) the Eiffel Tower falls.<br /><br />With only one chance left to recapture the weapons and take on this new enemy, later to be called Cobra, the team sets out to save the world. Will they make it in time? Will they have sufficient weapons to do so? Does the sun rise in the east?<br /><br />This movie is a blast. It takes the toys so many were fond of playing with (for my age 12\\" tall jointed clod hoppers, for the younger set 6\\" tall characters with names and multiple weapons) and brings them to life on the screen. It makes those many minutes of animated cells seen by so many for so long come to life and appear in full color action, blasting their way across the screen.<br /><br />The story is simple. Good guy versus bad guy. To make it complete we get background segments that explain who these characters are, fleshing them out further than the cartoons had time for. Duke and the Baroness, Cobra Commander and Duke, and everyone's favorite, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. There pieces give us a full fledged story to wrap all the action around.<br /><br />But it is the action that takes center stage here. This is a definite popcorn flick determined to keep you cheering for the good guys and hissing the bad. Underwater battles, snow covered terrains, secret lairs in the Sahara and enough rough and ready heroes to make the world seem a safer place.<br /><br />More than anything this movie is about having fun. It makes it a film that all ages can enjoy as opposed to playing too much to the young, or overdoing the adult thing for parents. Unlike the cartoon, people do die here and when shot fall down for good. But not to the point of glorifying the violence or lingering on it. Think Lone Ranger in the 50'stype violence.<br /><br />Having seen the movie twice, in the theater and now on DVD, I can't recommend it enough. It's not just one that you'll want to rent, but one you'll want to add to your collection. Myself, I determine that by if I think I'd watch it again. This is a movie to be viewed over and over and have fun with again and again.I can't recommend it enough. It's not just one that you'll want to rent, but one you'll want to add to your collection.

B00061QJZI|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter who tells me it is one of her favorite movies.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I just picked up this movie from Amazon on Blu Ray as this is truly a movie I can watch over and over again. Specifically I enjoy watching this movie every year during the Holiday's. The movie is truly a romantic comedy that will pull at your heart strings in one scene and then have you laughing hysterically in another scene. The movie follows multiple couples throughout London during the Christmas season as they all are looking for love. Martine McCutcheon and Keira Knightkey are down right beautiful and funny in their respective scenes. Allen Rickman is great as always as the boss of a small company. The stories of all of the couples are intertwined nicely. If for some reason you haven't seen this movie yet you need to buy it immediately as it will be a movie you will consistently watch year after year. This movie is a must watch during the Christmas season along with my other perennial favorite National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.    **********Spoiler Alert***********    There is no way I can pick a best scene from this movie but between the opening shot of the Heathrow Airport Visitors, to the restaurant in Portugal, to the \\"Carolers\\" who visit Keira Knightley this movie will always be great.

B002IR3PSC|4.0|This was another \\"Holy Grail\\" concert I'd waited on for three decades to come out.  It's pretty much a complete show from their 1978 tour.  Even Barrie's drum solo is here  ( CD and DVD, although sans video on the latter ).  Picture quality is decent, especially considering the technology of the video cameras of the seventies, and somewhat inadequate stage lighting for shooting a rock concert.  Ian Anderson is his usual witty, frustrated comedian self...if I have a complaint, it's that I wish the director had spent ten percent more time doing shots of the band members  ( and ten percent less of Mr. \\"mug for the camera\\" Anderson, much as I love the guy! ).  Jethro Tull have always been one serious band live, and this concert is no exception!  I saw them twice during the seventies, and left both times in awe of their musical prowess.<br /><br />The most pleasant surprise was that they actually went to the trouble to mix the multi-track audio from the original tapes, and synched it up with the video!  Two-inch VTRs weren't designed with stereo sound in mind, and only had one 'primary' and 'secondary' audio track...hence most seventies concert footage has only monaural audio.  It was relatively rare for them to bother with having a separate remote audio truck on site along with a video truck  ( Led Zeppelin apparently routinely did this every time they did location shooting, but they were more the exception to the rule ). Ironically, having gone to that effort, it's even more rare that, in releasing a seventies concert today, a producer would even bother to track down the multi-track audio tapes of a videotaped or filmed show.<br /><br />Disappointing that there is only fifty minutes of actual video footage from MSG...apparently there was no video truck at the arena  ( although they had a twenty-four track location audio truck on site; go figure! ).  The video was most likely captured by the BBC from the satellite transmission...and we can be thankful for them archiving it all these years.  It's easy to forget how expensive videotaping a show was, thirty-plus years ago, on tape that cost approximately three hundred dollars a reel in 1978.  I'd have preferred just the fifty minute portion on the DVD itself, accompanied by the full CD of the audio.  But all in all, a good DVD.  I heartily recommend this one to all Tull fans!ars.

B002OEBMN4|4.0|I'm a big Slayer fan, have been since RIB.  I thought this album was good, some other reviews said it was a classic, I don't know if I would go that far.  I thought some of the lyrics were a little weak and cliche, even for Slayer.   On the one hand I found myself thinking \\"yeah, I've heard that before\\" on some of the songs, but then with Slayer you know what you're going to get.   There was also a review that said the rhythm guitars were too thin in the mix.  I totally agree.  They seem buried in the background, I prefer my crunching chords front and center, a la Bitter Peace or New Faith.  The song that came the closest to that sound IMO was Not of this God.  The solos and such are what get the most attention.  Vocals are good, as always.  So, definitely a good strong album, but not a classic in my opinion.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|Some things should just be left alone. The first two Transatlantic CD's were epic creations (especially the classic BAF). Whirlwind, on the other hand is another story. Most of the complaints thus far have been around Neal's \\"preaching\\" on this one. What about the MUSIC??? Sure the virtuosity of Morse, Portnoy, Trewavas and Stolt is all there, but the memorable compositions such as \\"We all need some light\\", \\" Bridge Across Forever\\", \\"All of the Above\\" and the MASTERPIECE \\"Stranger in Your Soul\\" are nowhere to be found. Instead we have a smattering of styles (Some Flower Kings, Some Marillion and NOT ENOUGH Spock's Beard).The second CD is a complete waste. The (4) original songs are sub par (rushed sounding) tracks. And do we really never \\"cover tunes\\"?? I was anxiously awaiting a Transatantic reunion. Unfortunately , this \\"Whirlwind\\" came forth.......      10/1 Revision. After giving this CD many listens, I need to amend my initial \\"snap to judgement\\" review. I LOVE this CD. It REALLY grows on you and the consistent musical theme's that weave through \\"Whirlwind\\" are memorable! Neal Morse has a knack for creating masterpieces. Transatlantic are the perfect synergistic band. They feed off each others talents..... I highly recommend that you get caught up in the Whirlwind. You'll never look back.
B001EO748M|5.0|yes.. i love this series.  cant wait for season 3 to get here and cant wait for the final 4th season to start.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|I ordered this for my young grandson when I couldn't find it in the local stores (was told they had to pull it off shelves).  He loves the movie just as much as the Toy Story disk he has.  I've watched it once with him and was not disappointed with the quality of the animation like the other great ones this company puts out.  It was delivered very fast and highly recommend the seller.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|S.O.A., what an amazing new risque program. I love motorcycles, so this show was, of course, right up my alley. Great stories, great plot twists. Violence, profanity and partial nudity throughout...what's there not to love. And Blu-ray just makes it that much better. If you like the sopranos or the shield, you'll like this show. It's great. :)
B00275EGTW|4.0|Just saw this, and must admit it is heavily and very conciously influenced in some Sci-Fi classics, as most reviewers state: Silent Running, Solaris, 2001, Alien (evil company), even Total Recall and Alien Resurrection (go and figure it out)! While other sci-fi movies like Sunshine (see my review) are also heavily influenced by others, Moon stablish a peculiar tone and relies on the best elements of its fathers, isolation, AI, genetic engineering, space loneliness, decaying world and society...sometimes with subtle and sometimes very specifically takes all these previously explored themes and makes them its own. Have to admit that at first view I thought 'yeah, like 2001', 'yeah, like Silent Running', '...like Solaris', but at 2/3 through the film I dismissed all this because the plot was interesting enough and kept wondering what would happen with the characters.    Production design is good and FX are more than decent, I loved some of the moon exteriors; acting is more than competent, and Kevin Spacey's AI voice and character dignifies old HAL 9000.    So, why not 4 or 5 stars? I also felt that there were some plot elements left unexplained and superficially treated, when the movie ends, the sensation is that you would like to see and KNOW much more. Nevertheless a worthy effort that surely will end up in my Sci-Fi collection. Recommend it to all sci-fi fans who can concentrate and pay attention to a movie, no matter if action never kicks in.    PS. What are the other top worthy sci-fi films of the 21st century? Children of Men, Solaris, AI, District 9, War of the Worlds, A Scanner Darkly, Cube: Hypercube (a sequel, but its concept still thrills me) and of course: Moon.  ...Star Trek 2009? hmm I'll have to think about that, is more space adventure than hardcore sci-fi.
B001PE26QQ|5.0|Best martial arts movie I have seen in a long time! No over the top stuff - just true full contact martial arts action. Don't let the subtitles bother you    - This is one enjoyable film!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|What more can be said about \\"Thriller\\"? It's a known fact that it is the best selling album of all time(it is hard to give an exact number as of yet but it's pretty high, some sources state up to 110 millions) and it's safe to say that with downloading now and the decrease of record sales in past years that it will never be equaled. By 1982 Michael Jackson was already an established artist by that point having released the successful \\"Off The Wall\\" in 1979, his first \\"real\\" solo album without his brothers and having performed for many years with his brothers as the Jackson 5 and later simply the Jacksons. Nothing could prepare him for the super stardom that would hit him with \\"Thriller\\". With this album Michael wanted to an album with no fillers and whether or not he planned it he accomplished much more than that.<br /><br />There are plenty of great songs to be found here just take a look at the track listing; all great songs and nearly all of the album's songs were singles, 7 out of 9 not bad eh? \\"Wanna Be Startin' Sometin'\\" is a great opener, the title of this song says it all Michael wanted to start something big and with Thriller he did just that. \\"Baby be Mine\\" is a groovy kind of song, very good. \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" duet with Paul McCartney is a great collaboration between the two artists. The title track was a monster hit and it seems every Halloween it's all you hear, great song. \\"Beat It\\" is one of my personal favorites, a rocking track that features an Eddie Van Halen guitar solo. Then there is of course the unforgettable \\"Billie Jean\\", it's hard to believe that producer Quincy Jones initially wanted the long introduction removed. \\"Human Nature\\" is another song I really like showcasing a softer side of Michael. \\"P.Y.T (Pretty Young thing)\\" and \\"The Lady In My Life\\" are not to be forgotten, they're also great songs.<br /><br />With \\"Thriller\\" Michael would not only change the music itself as he pretty much turned by himself the music video from a promotional tool to an art form as has been said. The videos for Thriller, Beat It and Billie Jean are still remembered today and had a tremendous impact. The contribution this album made to music are certainly important, many artists of today have been influenced by him for this album especially.He would never release an album quite like Thriller again, don't get me wrong I love all his albums but this is the kind of a album can usually only happen once in a career. This album is essential, there is no other way of putting its a must have. 5 stars and I would give it much higher if I could. By the way you might want to check out the 25th Anniversary edition it has an unreleased track \\"For All Time\\", some remixes by today's artists and a DVD with the videos for Thriller, Beat It and Billie Jean and his legendary Motown 25th anniversary performance.form as has been said.

0786868724|5.0|This book was awesome. Speaking as someone who lost their faith a long time ago, this book is awesome. I started reading the book because I'm a fan of the author, but the book actually ended up bringing back some of my faith. Some of my questions about life and religion and God (that i never asked) were answered by the Rabbi in the book. I wish that I could have met the people in real life. They most certainly would have had an impact on my life sooner. Someone might pick up the book for a read, but end up putting it down having learned more about themselves, life and religion.
1594202249|4.0|Everyone is calling \\"Inherent Vice\\" Pynchon-Lite, but I think a more fitting way to think of it is \\"the lighter side of Thomas Pynchon.\\" Really, \\"Inherent Vice\\" is a wonderful, hilarious, and almost candid opportunity to somewhat more easily digest many of the crucial themes that have preoccupied Pynchon since \\"V.\\" This novel is also a fabulous period piece as well as a poignant critique of our society that extends far beyond L.A. in 1970. Indeed, the principle behind an inherent vice strikes me one of the most succinct ways of getting to the core of Pynchon's view of society, culture, and experience:<br /><br />\\"It was as if whatever had happened had reached some kind of limit. It was like finding the gateway to the past unguarded, unforbidden because it didn't have to be. Built into the act of return finally was this glittering mosaic of doubt. Something like what Sauncho's colleagues in maritime insurance liked to call inherent vice. 'Is that like original sin?' Doc wondered. 'It's what you can't avoid,' Sauncho said...\\"
B002JTHFUS|4.0|The classic 'The Unforgettable Fire' is re-mastered here for the 25th anniversary  of its release.  To me, the improvements are just too modest for most people to appreciate.  It's certainly not worth the new purchase by itself.  But this package also comes with a bonus CD and DVD.  The bonus CD is a great mood piece for that period.  The B-sides, while certainly deserving of the designation relative to the songs that ultimately made the album, would make the final cut for 99.9% of the bands out there today.  The songs from Wide Awake and '11 O'Clock' are particular gems from that time.  The DVD is also chock full of great morsels.  The first part contains all the Fire videos and a good 'making of' doc.  These music videos are representative of that time, so are a great trip down memory lane for those of us that are children of MTV.  The DVD also has their Amnesty and Live Aid sets, both must-have and iconic, and a '11 O'Clock' bootleg from Croke Park just two weeks before LiveAid, which, while not top quality, is fun to watch.  Only thing missing is a full-length concert, which made the Joshua Tree deluxe set from 2007 such a great value.    Though so much of this was available before, this product is really nice for die hard fans who want a summation of this very important period in U2's history delivered to their home in a nice package. (The packaging is great, in a nice solid box, with a nicely done book and picture cards.  Very similar to the Josua Tree set.)  It would also make a great gift for any serious U2 fan.

B002KDUDG6|5.0|I wasn't too excited about this release when I saw the track listing. I mean,'Cry Me a River' is like covered by more than a dozen great singers. Would Buble do it any differently, I asked myself. But he did. And the song, which is the first cut, is amazing, new, original.    Don't expect any heart-wringers like 'Home' or even 'Everything' though - but some songs do come close.    Still a very good buy.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones is an old school small town policeman.<br />When young women start showing up dead and badly cut up,<br />he has to investigate. A murder that he witnessed 40 years before plays a part<br />and he seems to have a time travel episode when<br />it seems like the case is going no where,<br />He meets a famous southern general who gives him fatherly advice,<br />which comes to think is his mind playing bad tricks on him.<br />The resulting movie is well made and keeps your attention,<br />but might not be very popular with a modern audience<br />as the plot forces you to think<br />about the system that still rules in the south.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|One of the best films of 2009.  I went into it with no knowledge of any Star Trek history and loved it.  I think if you like a good story, good dialogue, good action, and great characters this is the film for you.  It also has one of the best ensemble cast I have ever seen.  I would recommend watching it in theaters or at least on a big screen.
B002E9HACG|3.0|Last Look at Eden is arguably Europe's best CD since the band got back together in 2003, after a long hiatus.  The first five tracks are outstanding, with good melodies, and something of a 1970s hard rock feel.   Tracks 6-11, however, sound more like the nu-metal that the band played on their last release, The Secret Society.   The closing cut is unusual, one of this band's few ventures into slow blues.   Bottom line: about half this CD is excellent; the remainder is only fair.
0385737947|5.0|When Thomas wakes up he doesn't know where he is. Where he's been or who he is. All he knows is his name is Thomas and something is not right. The box he woke up in deposits him in that Glade. A large place surrounded by huge walls and a unsolvable Maze. That's only the beginning...<br /><br />To be honest I procrastinated on reading this for awhile. I kept hearing all the amazing things about it so I thought what the heck I'll read it! All those amazing things were true.<br />The story starts off with Thomas knowing nothing! We learn with him. We see everything through his eyes. The pace at the beginning was a bit slow but that's my only complaint. That's understandable too because like I said Thomas knows nothing at the beginning. When the story takes off you will be on the edge of your seat for the rest of the book. You may need a massage afterward to work out all that tension.<br /><br />James Dashner's writing is extraordinary. He is very skilled in building up suspense and revealing secrets slowly. Never have a wanted to shake a book so much because I wanted the characters to figure something out. That shows a amazing skill in the author. In my opinion.<br />The characters were very well written considering they had little if any backstory. I found myself loving these characters or hating them and using their dirty words in my head.<br /><br />Overall I just flat out loved this book. I think you will too. The Maze Runner will pull you in and it won't even let go after the book is over. This is one of those book that stays on you mind long after that last page.

0316044938|5.0|A few years ago I read the book \\"Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold and I loved it.  I am not sure love is appropriate because it is such a sad storyline but it is just written so well.  I have never read a book like it before either as it is actually told from a 14-year old girls perspective.<br /><br />On her way home from school in December 1973, Susie Salmon was raped and murdered by a serial killer, who she knows.  The story is told as she watches from heaven, her friends and family's reactions to her death.  She watches her family as they change and grow and she struggles to accept her death.  Now even though she is in heaven it does not have a religious tone, but deals with Susie's own version of heaven.<br /><br />Lovely Bones is sad, frustrating, and yet it is so hard to put down.  I actually read the book in two sittings.  I have to warn you though the description of Susie's rape and attack is chilling and is powerful.  That is where I got so mad, but kept reading because I wanted to hear her story.<br />In December 2009, Lovely Bones is coming to movie theaters.  If you haven't read the book , I highly recommend reading it, especially if you think you are going to see the movie.  I know I am curious about the movie to see how Dreamworks interprets what happens.<br /><br />Alice Sebold is also the author of Lucky, which is her own memoir of being raped herself when she was a college freshman.  It is also a powerful and touching book.<br /><br />I was given this book to review.  You can read more of my reviews (and enter giveaways) at [...]
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I'd never read one of Lehane's books before but was told by a friend that I'd like it. She was right. I loved it! I didn't see the ending coming. I like when a book surprises me. Too often the author assumes we readers are stupid and beats us over the head with ridiculous amounts of foreshadowing. This is not the case here. The only hint at the ending is the prologue. I won't spoil it for you. I loved this book and am curious to see how it will translate to the big screen.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Many people find that describing the movie to give a movie review is the way to go. Usually, I refrain, but on this occasion, I will include the plot. A husband and wife, already with two children of their own (one who is deaf) lose their third child during labor. They resort to adopting an orphan--a 9-year-old, seemingly intelligent and kind-hearted, little Russian girl. Much to their dismay, what seems to be the perfect adoption turns into anything but. The movie moves at a slow but determined pace for the first 45 minutes or so, but then the rockin' starts to rollin' as the story spirals into a cacophony of strangeness accompanied with mountains of vindictive mayhem. Many reviews I have read had a problem with the twist; I thought it to be VERY COOL, and something that could become reality in the realm of possibility, which makes it all the more founded, thus being all the more horrific. Just before the twist; however, something happened that made me think, \\"Okay, here we go...right back into the silly Hollywood horror film crap that has been bombarding us throughout the beginning of the new century.\\" But when the twist hits and everything finally makes sense, I was thankfully pulled from that train of thought and taken back into a bizarre and wonderful story. Dark Castle Entertainment has done a LOT of movies that I simply love (Gothika, Ghost Ship, and Thirteen Ghosts.) This one will have to go into that group of five-star movies. Don't miss it!  FIVE STARS ***** for everything being done the way it should be done!
B000W93CHC|4.0|This is a great book, I enjoyed \\"Pillars in the Earth\\" many years ago and was excited when this sequel was finally written. The characters are strongly developed and there is enough detail in the story to allow an avid reader to dawdle through the book.      I keep getting the feeling; however, that I've read this book before.  Not only does the plot seem familiar, but especially the characters.     Did anyone else notice this?
0790729407|5.0|In my opinion, the movie was excellent.  Even though I felt a few artistic liberties might have been taken, from what I can see, the movie was pretty much 'on point'.  Liam Neeson, did an outstanding job in portraying the Irish leader, Michael Collins, intelligent, highly motivated and passionate about what he was trying to attain, almost to a fault. (Note:  of course I expected no less from the actor - excellent in whatever he portrays).  The movie sheds light on a bit of Irish history regarding the IRB and IRA; the fight to break British total rule over Ireland, and Michael Collins efforts to accomplish this.  The movie should be watched closely , noting, that there was a split among the Irish people and in the end, it was the Irish against Irish (which seems to be ongoing, to some extent,even today).  I had seen/rented the movie before, but it's the kind of movie I can watch again and again.  I enjoyed it that much.  So, I decided to purchase the DVD from Amazon for my own library. When I received the DVD, I immediately watch it over again,twice.  If you are interested in anything regarding a bit of Ireland's history, or the history of the IRB/IRA,I recommend you buy this movie. Each time I watch it, (contrary to what others might feel), I am left with a deep sense of respect for the young Irish leader and what he accomplished during his brief political career.
B000002MY3|5.0|After Alanis Morrisette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" came out in 1995, radio played the heck out of several different songs on it.  I liked what I heard, and I purchased the CD, but put it away and listened to it rarely if at all.      Now at a distance of more than 10 years, I pulled out the CD to give it a fresh hearing and decide how it stands up to the test of time. First observation is that it still stands alone--there is nothing really like it, and that includes the subsequent albums by Alanis herself.  There are some suggestions of her pull-your-hair-back-and-belt-it-out performance in others` work--I'm thinking particularly of Katy Perry or, very differently, of Slater-Kinney..  I am still struck that this is a unique artistic work, though, the female equivalent of early albums by The Who, or The Rolling Stones in their most popular phase in the `70's and `80's:  a pure expression of hormonal-driven emotion.     This is not to say that she did this all by herself:  full props to her partner, musical accompanist, and producer Glen Ballard for his contributions.  Some of the songs were just Glen and Alanis, take after take, layer after layer, but there are other strong musical contributions, especially Benmont Tench on keyboards and some guest guitarists (Michael Landau, and Dave Navarro and Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers).  Me, I love the layered sound, and Ballard brought it right up to the line of being overproduced.  But not over it:  the effect is to give a full, detailed frame to enhance the power of her vocal performances.      I would generalize those performances by saying they are fairly dripping with emotion.  The range of emotions, and the dynamics suiting them, vary quite a lot, though:  fury at the lover who scorned her (\\"You Oughta Know\\"), and at a record producer who didn't take her seriously (\\"Right Through You\\"), disgust at the weakness of others (\\"Wake Up\\", \\"Not the Doctor\\"), but also sympathy (\\"Mary Jane\\"), a pure expression of love for her companion (\\"Head Over Feet\\"), and some real , wise recognition of the ambiguity in life (\\"Perfect\\", \\"Hand In Pocket\\", \\"Ironic\\").    One of my two favorite cuts on the disk is \\"All I Really Want\\", which I take as humorous (if not, it would be insufferable!)--a puckish, self-mocking lyric set to a whiny, Oriental soundtrack (think \\"hippie chick\\") that includes her \\"short list\\" of deliverables: patience, deliverance, companionship, sincerity, purity, spirituality, profundity, intellectuality, peace, harmony, and justice.  (I'm reminded of the Stones in \\"Some Girls\\" and their stereotypes of women:  \\"American women want...everything in the world you can possibly imagine.\\"  OK, she's Canadian, but you get the idea.)     My favorite song on the album, though, and one of my absolute all-time favorites, is \\"Forgiven\\", which I notice many of my fellow Amazon reviewers have shied away from trying to interpret.  On the face of it, it's a rueful remembrance of her bad old days in Catholic school, from which she has managed to recover her faith.  I think there's something more, though.     The framing of the message is a supremely long crescendo, from acoustic guitar and soft crooning, to a massive, wall-banging chorus with Alanis wailing the chorus at the top of her lungs, the notes tinged heavily with emotion.  And what a chorus:       \\"We all had our reasons to be there/We all had a thing or two to learn/We all needed something to cling to/So we did\\"; and the second chorus:   \\"We all had delusions in our head/We all had our minds made up for us/We had to believe in something/So we did\\".     There, in a few short lines, is a summary of the entire lived experience of most of humanity, from the very beginnings of time all the way to the present, and well into the future.  So, yes, I think there's something there.   Whatever her sins, for those lines alone I would judge her to be \\"forgiven\\".     I can see how some  might not like this album:  for the purist, for example, she shows a beautiful voice, then abuses it terribly.  She sounds screechy at times, and the anger can be off-putting:  many of my brothers had defensive, cover-your-crotch reactions.  (An acoustic version of the songs put out 10 years later might be a good corrective for those who thought it \\"too angry\\".) After  JLP, though, it can never be said that women can`t rock just as furiously as men, and in their own mode, not merely a pale imitation of male rock.  Her performance on this album was a pure expression of human nature (for at least half of humanity), and as such it demands at least our respect.
B001UV4XTC|1.0|All right.  I got the biblical allusions in A SERIOUS MAN, such as the story of Job, the temptation of David, yada yada yada.  That still doesn't mean that there was much of a story or for that matter--character development and plot--in this poor excuse of a movie.  This is the type of film that gives arthouse cinema a bad name.  I never felt so bored in my life.  If the Coen brothers wanted to make a movie of a physics professor who is tortured by his everyday life--fine.  But don't torture your audience at the same time.  I find the Coen brothers to be wildly inconsistent in the quality of their films--much like Steven Soderbergh.  They'll make brilliant films like Fargo and No Country For Old Men and then losers like this one, Barton Fink, The Man Who Wasn't There, Ladykillers, etc.  Not recommended at all.  Instead, go see Amreeka.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I loved this album to death.  I can't stop playing it.  However, I am interested in obtaining a copy of the single remixes of million dollar bill and I look to you.    By the way, is there a U.S. single release from her album?  Is the U.S. still doing single releases?
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE. THIS MOVIE MADE ME LAUGH; IT DEFINITELY WASN'T A HORROR MOVIE IN MY OPINION. I LAUGHED MY HEAD OFF  WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!
B002HWUU2C|5.0|The cd simply doesnt do the band justice. They are something to be experienced \\"live\\". I just saw them in MIlwaukee on Nov. 1st. They were nothing short of spectacular. Of all the live shows I've seen,(I've seen my share), Iwould say that this ranks as the best. You have to experience the power of Glen's voice, and the subtleness of Mar's for yourself. A lot is lost in the translation to cd. I was especially touched when Mar started play \\"O Holy Night\\" on the piano, and then singing about half the song through with her incredible voice. The Frames are simply fantastic. The bass shook your bones, the drumming was spot on for the music, the violin solos masterful. Glen is the John Lennon of our generation. His songwriting talent, guitar mastery, vocal talent, and presence remind me very much of him. He has that who gives a ***k attitude. Someone interrupted him when he was talking, and he got very mad! He's a man who loves his music and won't take anycrap from nobody. You have to admire him for that. I enjoyed the fact that both the live cd and dvd were recorded in MIlw. at The Riverside. Marketa commented on how lovely a city Milwaukee was. She even woke early in order to walk by the river and Lake Michigan. These 2 belong together. And this cd clearly shows that.

B001FB55I0|3.0|I just watched a screener of the director's cut, which is only 2-3 minutes more in running time than the theatrical version.  Let me first say that I thought this movie was solid from an action standpoint.  However, the myriad of plot holes, cheesy lines and bad acting moments from the theatrical version are still present in this Director's Cut!  Most of all, the infamous Moon Bloodgood topless scene is here....and it is TERRIBLE!! Description:  It's a short scene right before her character, Blair and Marcus get ambushed by thugs in the night.  For some reason, Blair walks out in the middle of the pouring rain and removes her top to wash her chest.  She covers her breasts with her hands, turns around at Marcus.  They give each other a long yearning stare...End Scene. I assume that McG was trying to force some kind of sexual tension between the two characters. Or maybe she was testing Marcus to see if she could trust him.  But why test him and have her gun more than 50 yards away for the thugs to find??  In short, the scene served absolutely no purpose in movie whatsoever and guess what, it didn't even show \\"them\\".  Poorly executed on every level and just embarrassing to watch!!     But the biggest problem I had with the plot is the belief that Connor had to save Kyle Reese.  This posed so many problems! The first 3 Terminator movies were about protecting the young John Connor to ensure the future.  But in Salvation, John Connor has to protect the young Kyle Reese to ensure the past, present AND future.  Clever writing, but still flawed because the movie basically takes the \\"Back to the Future\\" approach to time travel.  The belief that if Kyle Reese dies in the Resistance, then he can't go back in time.  Therefore, John Connor won't exist.  So does Connor actually believe that he could disappear out of thin air like in \\"Back to the Future\\"???  What's even more perplexing is that John Connor is the hero, the prophet and the messiah in the movie. However, when he makeshis big speech on the radio commanding the Resistance to stand down from bombing Skynet, his speech is very AMBIGUOUS.  As the viewer, you don't know if Connor intends to save the human prisoners in Skynet or just save Kyle Reese. In the previous Terminator films, it was justifiable for Sarah Connor and other characters to protect the life of John Connor.  But in Salvation, Connor protecting his own existence is theologically flawed.  Bottom line, is it okay for \\"the messiah\\" to save himself so he can be the savior of humanity in the future??  In my opinion, that is just sloppy and misguided story-telling!!      Other plot holes. 1) No explanation on why Kyle Reese was number 1 on the Skynet kill list. 2) When Reese was identified, why didn't Skynet kill him immediately? 3)Once Marcus entered the Resistance compound, why didn't Skynet just locate him and invade? 4) Worst of all, the heart of the film was literally a heart in the film!!!     I was hoping that the Director's Cut would address some of these plot holes, but it addressed NONE of them.  Unfortunately, McG seemed more preoccupied with cool, flashy one-take action sequences than story-telling. Rumor has it that there will be a FINAL CUT released after this Director's Cut.  Unless there were actual re-shoots, I highly doubt any of these problems will be fixed. Overall, the blame ultimately lies on the director McG. It was a good effort though.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|I went into this movie, fully expecting to hate it. I really liked G.I. Joe when I was a kid, had a whole backpack full of the little guys that I carried around with me. I figured they would mess up this one like Transformers did for me.... (Bubble Bee is a Volkswagen Bug!... That's why they call him Bubble Bee.... He's a Bug! He's the little guy!) but anyways...   If you were a huge fan of the cartoon, then you will probably hate this movie. They butchered the back stories of each character pretty bad. Snake Eye's and Storm Shadow's story is really awkward. It has elements of their orginal story, but still seems to mess it up.  (And that's why it loses a star) I will never understand why they can't leave characters alone in films, why must they always change them somehow?  (Cobra Commander looks like some deformed power ranger at the end of the movie)  Sorry G.I. Joe diehards. They let you down.  But with all that aside, I just really enjoyed the film. I had fun watching it. Sure there are some really hard to believe parts and some really corny parts, but I just got into that Saturday morning cartoon mode. You know the one that doesn't really care if everything is perfect. The \\"I got no school today and all I want to do is watch some explosions and some butt wippin'.\\"  No it's not a great movie, but I enjoyed it.
0679722610|4.0|I've always been a big fan of The Maltese Falcon and other noir classics, but I'd never read a Dashiell Hammett novel. When I saw Red Harvest mentioned in a magazine article, I thought, \\"Why not start here?\\"    Though Red Harvest is supposed to be set in a Western town called Personville, it feels like it's set in a big, hard-luck city. The only place big enough to fill the bill in 1929 was probably Denver. The nameless protagonist, a detective with the Continental Detective Agency in San Francisco, is called only the Continental Op(erative). The book has a huge cast of shady characters that are a bit hard to keep track of. The strangest thing about the book, though, it that it is completely passionless--almost to the point of being enervated. There are dozens of murders and ganglang killings throughout, but each one is described as coolly and bloodlessly as the next. Obviously, this coolness gives a really hard edge to the emotionless Continental Op, which I'm sure was Hammett's intention, but it also make it hard to feel anything for anyone.    Nevertheless, the dialog is smart, snappy and witty. That's the best reward for reading the book.    I admitted that I hadn't read any other of Hammett's novels so I wonder about his range of characterization, but if you've read (or seen) The Maltese Falcon, you've already been introduced to the main characters in Red Harvest: The Continental Op is a dead ringer for Sam Spade (actor Humphrey Bogart) in The Maltese Falcon. Likewise, Dinah Brand for Brigid O'Shaughnessy (actress Mary Astor), bootlegger Max Thaler for Joel Cairo (actor Peter Lorre), corpulent police Chief Noonan for Kasper Gutman (actor Sydney Greenstreet). They're all here--and more--and they're all part of the fun of reading Red Harvest.

0385504225|3.0|I'll spare you the critique of Brown's writing style that many other reviewer's are offering because I'm no expert.  I will, however, tell you what I thought of the story.    If, like me, you enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, you probably won't like this one as well.  Brown's previous two novels featuring the Robert Langdon character immediately pulled me in and kept me turning pages until I had finished.  They also both pulled off some shocking twists and dramatic endings.  The Lost Symbol, on the other hand, is at times boring, but there was still enough there to keep me reading.  The ending is where I felt really let down.  I felt like Chapters 123 through the Epilogue could almost have been wholly eliminated.  The author attempts to tie up some loose ends, but he does it in such an unsatisfying and strained way that I almost wish I had simply closed the book at the end of Chapter 122.  I wish I could elaborate more, but I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone.    Also, if I never see the word \\"esoteric\\" again, I'll be ok with that.  I think it must have appeared in this novel in excess of 100 times.  There are other repetitions in the novel that annoyed me a little as I read, but other reviewers have covered them thoroughly.    Bottom line: Pick it up at the library, but don't buy it.  I doubt you will find yourself wanting to read through it again.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Okay, this movie delivered what it intended---a lighthearted, frivolous, romantic comedy. Sure, it is riddled with cliche, after cliche, and you have to suspend disbelief regarding some of the silly plotting, but I found it to be simply irresistible. It's been a while, since I have actually laughed out loud at a movie. A grin, maybe, but not teary-eyed, laughter; this film had me doing so in several scenes. It has also been a while since I have wanted to watch ANY movie more than once, but I'm ready to watch this one again.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock is adorable. It's a mystery to me, how she appears to grow more attractive with each movie.  Totally unfair!  If the ladies out there make their male partners, or friends, sit through this (mostly) 'chick flick,' they won't be disappointed, either.  They will be rewarded by watching Bullock in some revealing situations we haven't seen her in before.  Fortunately, they were handled with such fun and class, as would be expected from Bullock. However, the movie IS PG13 for sexual content, nudity, and language, so it is not for the younger audience.<br /><br />It is clear that Bullock and Reynolds are friends, because their chemistry together shines through. And, the secondary characters often share the spotlight. Betty White is as feisty and clever as ever, and such a complement to this film.  I think she had a lot of fun doing this one; she radiates joy.<br /><br />If you like the cast, and view this movie for what it is, you should have 108 minutes of true escapism, fun.  Enjoy!

0060558121|4.0|The main character is a man called Shadow. He just made it out of prison and is excited to get home to his wife. Unfortunately, the night before he's released he finds out his wife died in a car accident with his best friend. Now Shadow has no ties to the real world, and he makes the acquaintance of a business man named Mr. Wednesday, who offers Shadow a job. Through Mr. Wednesday Shadow meets many strange and unusual people, but the funny thing is that Shadow seems to fit in with them.<br />I know there are a lot of metaphors and religious messages in this book, but don't look at me for what they are because I was not thinking that deeply while I read it. Mostly I enjoyed the book. The only time I didn't was when I felt I was supposed to know the people/Gods that Shadow or Mr. Wednesday were talking to. I felt a little confused at the ending; it felt like there was too many people in the pot.<br />As a character, I liked Shadow and related to him through most of the book except(warning this may spoil the ending for you) when he returns at the end. I just couldn't understand why he would come back after being done with the world. I just didn't see it happening.<br />In the end, I enjoyed the story and the characters, and I would read the sequels and short stories connected to American Gods.
0316017922|4.0|I already was aware that many of the methods by which society selects for \\"success\\" are biased towards many under-represented groups. I just didn't realize how many groups were under-represented: culture, language and most surprisingly: birthday.<br /><br />I appreciated the fact that Gladwell opened the book with a story about Roseto, the small Pennsylvania community of Italian immigrants that lived like Italians. Leading towards abnormally low death rates from \\"American\\" health problems. In my own quest for a healthy lifestyle, this story was another level of reinforcement. But did Gladwell completely contradict it by speaking of 24/7/365 work in the book's closing chapters? I was rather aghast at the lifestyle required by children in the KIPP schools, especially after becoming familiar with John Taylor Gatto's Underground History of American Education, the fact that the modern education system was built to create a mass of people accustomed to dull repetitive work. However, the point here is that constant schooling is the only way to allow impoverished students to compete with their affluent counterparts.<br /><br />Frankly, Outliers has led me to summarize that the individual is important to each life's success story but clearly contributes something more like 20% whereas societal context, background, culture, parental influence, etc... results in 80% of our outcomes as \\"people\\", and I place people in quotes because I doubt that we truly exist without such context. This may be tough medicine to swallow for a nation like America, devout in its adherence to individualistic ideas like entrepreneur-ship and hard work yielding big results. The philosophies of those around me in a corporate environment often leave little time for relationships and hobbies. The truth is that success is more like a combination of luck and preparation, as demonstrated by the 10,000 hours of practice being the key that set the Beatles and Bill Gates apart when opportunity came knocking. Perhaps the line between genius applied to scientific revelation and isolated anger is all too thin as denoted by Robert Oppenhimer  and Chris Langan, respectively. Social background may limit more of our great minds than any other mechanism.<br /><br />As stated above, most surprising to me was the role that birth date played in professional athlete selection. Seemingly a parody, it is sadly a very real demonstration of how our methods of choosing \\"winners\\" from little leagues to SATs lop off a huge chunk of talent from the overall talent pool that we can draw on to solve new approaches to human innovation. A \\"discrimination\\" that has played out in my own life, achieving acceptance to Stanford University's Graduate School yet being denied by University of San Diego despite the fact that UCSD admissions didn't review my file, they just saw that I didn't have a 700 quantitative GRE and refused to pursue me any further. I wouldn't want to be part of a school that selected merely on the basis of GRE, if my GRE score led to my denial as part of a holistic view of my record then I would gladly accept that outcome. Doubly so, I don't want to be part of a society that chooses people of status based on such ridiculous criteria, the absurdity of which Gladwell excels in exposing.<br /><br />One could argue that the evidence of selection bias is too anecdotal but perhaps that is the crux of the entire argument: the stories we tell ourselves about success are outdated and it is time for some new ones. Outliers is a quick read and an important one. I hope that the architects of society at all levels take the opportunity to read or at least skim this volume. Outliers could very quickly and inexpensively bring equality and innovation to new levels of ubiquity.between genius applied to scientific revelation and isolated anger is all too thin as denoted by Robert Oppenhimer  and Chris Langan, respectively.

B0012GMUSQ|4.0|This EP has been outdated for a decade with the release of Alice in Chains \\"Music Bank.\\" All 4 songs can be found on that cheap 3 disc boxed set.    With that being said, this is a really enjoyable, more mellow, acoustic sounding CD that goes about 17 minutes. Its short and sweet, you can drift off to sleep with how mellow songs like Brother and Am I Inside are.    Got Me Wrong was on MTV and nearly every radio station in its hayday. In fact Got Me Wrong is still on alternative stations, old and new. There's a nice beat to it.    Right Turn is really enjoyable, the voices of Chris Cornell (Soundgarden) and singer Layne Stately blend really well. Its a good duet.    For the cheap price of $7, you get some great music, but again this is a 2008 rerelease of an outdated EP. Only buy this if you don't have $30 to spend on Music Bank or if you are a collector that needs every Alice in Chains release.

0887307280|4.0|Reviewer DougA (who gave this book 3 Stars) wrote: \\"Seasoned business people and grisled entrepreneurs will find this book repetitive, pedestrian and more than a little frustrating as they wait for Gerber to make his point\\". However DougA, like me, put this book on his class reading list. Gerber's clumsy device of the imaginary Sarah drives me up the wall, but buried in there are some really good and important messages: get over \\"loving to be a baker\\" or whatever and knuckle down; find a way of doing business that works and define it. Innovate, quantify, orchestrate is Gerber's way of saying what you can measure you can improve and later incorporate. I believe a lot of readers (people I've spoken with, some of them students) entirely miss Gerber's point. They think Gerber means \\"start a franchise\\", but he doesn't. Gerber means run your small business as if you were going to start a franchise. Now you have the message. Now you don't need the book.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|For years I've listened to Michael's music, his concerts and other live performances in rapt anticipation and have been appreciative of his obvious talents.<br /><br />Right off the bat, I'd like to say a few things historically about what I've heard. Through his career, Michael's biggest curse is that he's often compared to someone else, and while this fact is often inescapable of many musicians, some never leave the shadows of their peers even when it becomes less obvious because of the fan base that surrounds them. How many times have we heard him being compared to Harry Connick Jnr., or picking up where he left off? How about Frank Sinatra? Or having the same seductive qualities that Elvis Presley had? Numerous and far too many times to cite.<br /><br />His past albums have also highlighted these facts, too. Listening to `Surrender' on the album `Dream' you can hear him lifting his voice at those same moments that Elvis did in his signature renditions of the classic song. Some might say it's an homage, but I think more would say it's a failure on his part to make the song his own and letting the previous versions overshadow himself. These delicacies may not be obvious to the casual listener, but if you've listened to these songs for years and heard them in multiple versions by any previous named artist, then it just becomes glaring.  The most in-your-face examples are early in his career where he definitely sounds like he's singing from under the wing or on the back porch of Harry.<br /><br />But then comes this album and puts all the previous work, complaints, struggles and the like - to rest. Every song on this album has become his own and he has created a new standard for some of these old classics in a most memorable and quite gifted way. These versions will be the ones that may stay around for some time, possibly even eclipsing the originals.  During `Georgia On My Mind' you don't hear Ray Charles, you hear Michael Buble. During `You're Nobody Till Somebody ...' you definitely do not hear Frank Sinatra, which was wise of him to cover here and show that he's finally been able to pull it off, you - again - hear Michael Buble. During `At This Moment' you expect to hear Billy Vera, but you don't. It's definitely Michael. And it's a good thing.<br /><br />Another previous complaint that others have had, has been that the orchestration for a lot of his songs/performances just didn't quite `gel' with the singer, or the band seemed like hired-day-players that kept their distance. Previous albums this has been a huge issue and made some of the work almost unlistenable to the trained ear, but finally it seems that Michael's band and Michael are now a group, doing things like they should, in unison and together. The playing has less of a studio quality aspect to it and more of an intimate feel. This has been a point that Harry Connick has always had over Michael, for the simple fact that Harry has known and played with most of the musicians in his band since childhood or from `around the way' as the old saying goes. Harry's band and Harry have always been together and complimentary and it's showed. Finally Michael Buble has his own band and is proud of it. So proud in fact, that he fronts them at the beginning of the first track for the first twenty seconds or so. Gutsy, even if it does sound as if he was tapped on the shoulder 'with a wink and a nod' to produce a James Bond theme song. I found it 'interesting', but not a complete detraction.<br /><br />I can find no real shortcoming with this album at all, and I personally think it's his best effort to date. Judging by the press and promotion he's getting a lot of other people think so, too. I can forsee a Michael Buble craze reaching into mainstream America and younger pop audiences where he hasn't yet been able to access previous.<br /><br />Well done.<br /><br />...do not hear Frank Sinatra, which was wise of him to cover here and show that he's finally been able to pull it off, you - again - hear Michael Buble.

B002SVBDYQ|4.0|The storyline of New Moon is dark and emotional so I wasn't surprised by the songs on the album.  If it were all happy, upbeat songs it wouldn't mesh with the movie. The more I listen to the album, the more it grows on me. I absolutely love the instrumental New Moon(The Meadow)!  Great song to listen to and unwind at the end of the day.
B000000W6F|4.0|This is a good CD, short compared to some other Smashing Pumpkins albums at 45 minutes. It has a number of alternative radio hits, \\"I Am One,\\" \\"Siva,\\" \\"Rhinoceros,\\" and the rockin' \\"Tristessa\\" None of the hits are nearly as good or notable as any of Smashing Pumpkins other top songs. Mostly because the lyrics don't stand out, but the grungy music sure does stand out.     This album is noise pop at its best and I mean that in a good way. It's all the drums, good chaotic guitar riffs, and singer Billy Corgan's vocals pale in comparison. Aside from the noise pop, there are some really good, mellow, dreamy songs like \\"Rhinoceros,\\" \\"Crush,\\" and \\"Suffer.\\" The dreamy, slow side of the album is a great way to balance everything out. Even the mellow songs have their unique qualities, like \\"Window Paine\\" builds nicely from a slow start and \\"Rhinoceros\\" has a guitar solo in the middle and at the end that make the song very radio friendly. A lot of the songs feel very good to relax at the end of a day and chill out.    If you're looking to relive the 90s or have the \\"pre-success pumpkins,\\" then please pick up this album. If you're just a casual fan looking for pumpkins, then try \\"Siamese Dream\\" or \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\"
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Bought this sharpener on a whim while at a local sporting goods store. I badly dulled one of my favorite pocket knives from over use. Impatiently, I tore open the package in my car and went to work. I figured that if the sharpener was bogus, I could just walk right back into the store and return it.<br /><br />WOW!!! Was I surprised. This thing is amazing! A few passes through the carbide blades followed by a few through the ceramic and I was sold. Brand new, my knife was NEVER this sharp - and it only took a few seconds.<br /><br />It's compact, light weight, amazingly effective and idiot proof. If you're thinking about getting one of these, don't even hesitate - just buy it.<br /><br />Still can't believe that this thing is only $10. Best money I've ever spent.
0767903854|5.0|Here's what I know about this book:<br /><br />1.  If you are a Bill Bryson fan ([[ASIN:076790818X A Short History of Nearly Everything]], [[ASIN:0307279464 A Walk in the Woods]], [[ASIN:0061965324 Shakespeare]]), then you will not be disappointed with In A Sunburned Country.  His perspectives and witticisms are still there.<br /><br />2.  If you have been to, or plan to travel to Australia, then this volume will provide you with unique insights:  the culture, the landscape, and the history.<br /><br />3.  If you consider yourself a people-watcher, you should find Bryson's observations of interest.<br /><br />Here are a few tidbits:<br /><br />\\"I bought a morning newspaper and found my way into a cafe.  It always amazes me how seldom visitors bother with local papers.  Personally I can think of nothing more exciting - certainly nothing you could do in a public place with a cup of coffee - than to read newspapers from a part of the world you know almost nothing about\\" (p. 71).<br /><br />\\"The friendliness of Australians - all of it quite sincere and spontaneous, as far as I could ever tell - never ceases to amaze or gratify\\" (p. 77).<br /><br />\\"...[Y]ou will never understand Australian politics.  Part of the problem, of course, is that it is nearly impossible to track Australian politics from abroad because so little news of the country's affairs leak out into the wider world.  But even when you are there and dutifully trying to follow it, you find yourself mired in a density of argument, a complexity if fine points, a skein of tangled relationships and enmities, that thwarts understanding.  Give Australians an issue and they will argue it so passionately and in such detail, from so many angles, with the introduction of so many loosely connected side issues, that it soon becomes impenetrable to the outsider\\" (p. 99-100).<br /><br />My three visits to Australia gave me the opportunity to \\"fact-check\\" Bryson.  From discussing the impacts of the rabbits that ravaged the land, to the general friendliness of the people, to the invisible native people, his observations fit my own.  I haven't been to Darwin, but based on the similarity of Bryson's reactions to parts of Australia that both of us visited, it doesn't sound like a particularly tourist-friendly location.<br /><br />My foray into the \\"sunburned\\" portion of the country (north of Adelaide to Woomera) gave me a very small taste of the outback.  I think Bryson did a good job at sensing its vastness and inhospitableness.  In the urban zones, there is a coffee house or pub on every corner, it seems.<br /><br />If you are planning a trip, real or imaginary, to Australia, I recommend this book.ble native people, his observations fit my own.

B0029O08WA|5.0|I couldn't help but think this soundtrack belonged more to an adult movie. The songs are pretty interesting and moody, and the CD grows on me the more I listen to it. It probably would've benefited from a more balanced arrangement (three quiet songs in a row and then two happy, loud songs is not good arranging), but that's the only complaint I have. The songs by Bon Iver and Grizzly Bear are my favorites.

0812580346|4.0|I watched the first episode of this TV show and saw it was based on this book so... The book was quite a bit different from the show, but i thought it was better.  Got more into the science and philosophy of what happened, whereas the show, so far, has focused more on the individual people and their relationships.  My only gripe with the book was that you know what caused the flash forward almost from the beginning.  Overall a very good read though.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|If you've never read the Sookie Stackhouse books of Charlaine Harris on which this series is based, the TV series is literally OK.  It's an interesting situation (vampires come out of the \\"coffin\\" thanks to a synthetic blood that eliminates the need for them to attack humans.)<br /><br />But for fans of the books, this series is a major disappointment.  Not because things are changed somewhat--you expect that in film adaptations--but the changes here are often damaging to the very things that made the books so much fun.  Season one, in all of its episodes, deals with the basic plot lines of the first book, \\"Dead Until Dark\\".<br /><br />First of all, in the books the lead character, waitress Sookie Stackhouse has a wonderful, wry, witty and slightly catty sense of humor.  She's reasonably smart, gracious, sexy, and lots of fun. That's totally gone here--Sookie as played by Anna Paquin is clueless, slutty, and shrewish--as if the entire series is a depiction of PMS.  In the book, although she works as a cocktail waitress, she is definitely a lady.  In the series she becomes trampy white trash.  In the books, Sookie's grandmother is pictured as an elegant, refined, kind if slightly old-fashioned lady.  In the series she dresses like a homeless person and is portrayed as kindly but hardly refined.<br /><br />Second--a lot of time is devoted to side stories involving minor characters whose characterization has been changed for no apparent reason other than to feature lots of sex and nudity.  Sookie's brother Jason is pictured not only as oversexed and not the sharpest tool in the box (as in the book) but as downright stupid, a drug addict and a bigot to boot.  And far too much time is spent on his sexual escapades.  Sookie's friend Tara becomes a major (and rather unpleasant) character here (as well as changing races).  The flamboyantly African-American cook Lafayette (who is portrayed sympathetically in the books) here becomes a dealer of particularly unpleasant drugs.  And Sam, Sookie's boss, who is a shape-shifter and a supernatural creature himself, by his unexplained and unreasoning hostility towards the vampires becomes much less sympathetic than in the book for no discernable reason.<br /><br />Third--there's a lot of gratuitous sex and pointless nudity.  The books have some graphic sex scenes in them--but they are all relevant to the plot or the characters.  This being HBO, you are treated to lots of naked bodies and simulated sex, regardless of the relevance to the story.  While the actors are all very attractive physically, this runs the risk of turning the series into soft-core porn.<br /><br />So in short--it's OK.  But I think you'll enjoy the books more.  They are funnier, more exciting and more interesting than the HBO series.e's boss, who is a shape-shifter and a supernatural creature himself, by his unexplained and unreasoning hostility towards the vampires becomes much less sympathetic than in the book for no discernable reason.

B002MW50KO|5.0|Bob Dylan recording a Chrismas Album. For those who know him, this did not come as a suprise. If someone thought however, that he would make some sort of joke out of it, one stands corrected. Dylan takes his work seriously. And that shows here. \\"Chrismas in the heart\\" is a great album, full of sometimes funny, sometimes joyfulf, sometimes contemplative christmas songs. It's a good choice for playing under the holiday tree. His version of \\"The First Noel\\" is one of the finest ever recorded.
0316044695|4.0|I picked up this book because Marcus Luttrell is scheduled to come to my school early next year.  Honestly, I usualy don't go for biographies, but this book might change that for me.  You can tell that, despite help from a true writer, Luttrell is the one responsible for most of the writing.  The book starts out by walking you through what it takes to become a Navy SEAL.  The procedure is obviously supposed to be excrutiating, but I didn't know it was anything like that.  It then goes on to tell the story of what happened to Luttrell and his team in the Afghani mountains.  The story ends up being devastating and sentimental.  The pacing is off at times, but if you are interested in biographies or thrillers, this book is definitely worth reading.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|The great classic I loved growing up, but blue-ray quality. It has many great special features that allow you to learn more about how the movie was made. This is the perfect Christmas present. I especially enjoyed the games and the Karaoke Sing Along.
0859537978|5.0|at first, i was a little disappointed that the words were different from the song that i know. it goes \\"all day long\\" instead of \\"all around the town.\\" but i am used to it now, and the illustrations are so cute and the author obviously put a lot of thought and effort into making her drawings detailed. i notice something new with each read. my 11 month old daughter gets very excited when we read this book. she sticks her little fingers through the cut outs and points at the pictures. i will probably get this as a gift for another child.

BAD ELEMENTS:  1. A LOT OF IRRELEVANT SCENES.  2. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS REMAIN.  3. A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME.  4. AN UBER-QUICK ENDING.    CONCLUSION: NOTHING VENTURED... BUT SOMETING GAINED.
141041986X|4.0|Who's the moron that decided to put up their used copy for $90+. Seriously, DO NOT pay that much for this book. Hopefully it was just a type or something. Go to the library and check it out or just buy it new. Good grief.    Anyway, this book grips you from the first page. I think it's because you know what's inevitably coming and you want to get there and see how it plays out. And it plays out quite nicely, to a point. Unfortunately, I found that the ending lacked the intensity of the beginning and middle. There's a big reason why and it's part of the plot, which I don't want to reveal, but as soon as it happens, it's as though there's no longer a sense of urgency or danger. It suddenly feels safe and I didn't like that at all. I wanted to be unsure of what was going to happen, but the last third of the books seemed like a forced plot because the author wanted it to be that way and not because it was the natural direction.     I bought the second book, \\"Catching Fire,\\" but haven't brought myself to read it because I was so disappointed with the ending. That said, it's still worth a read and is much better than most of the stuff coming out these days. I think Young Adult fiction is where all the best stories are so pay special attention to this genre.

I have this book to thank.<br /><br />Every popular kid apparently is an evil monster with no friends and builds popularity on the hurt feelings of \\"different\\" kids.  Every bullied kid wants to do what Peter did, they just don't have the guts (apparently)  and every female on the face of the planet (at least in New Hampshire) is a pathetic whiny Jack oh ninny who would go through severe torture just to keep a boyfriend/husband.<br /><br />The parts where the mother would wonder where she went wrong and was told how it was not her fault followed by flash backs of HUGE RED FLAGS that would make anyone believe its all the mothers fault were most hilarious.  I was one of the lucky readers, I stopped taking the book seriously early on.  \\"YOU CAN'T RUSH IN THERE PATRICK, ITS AGAINST PROTOCOL\\"  \\"THERE IS NO PROTOCOL FOR THIS, YOU CAN FIRE ME LATER!\\"  HA HA HA, classic..ACTUAL LINES FROM THE BOOK!! HA<br /><br />If you like Lifetime movies that pretend to tackle serious issues, you'll enjoy this to say the least.

B0001I55OC|2.0|Seeing snippets of this film on TV aroused my curiosity, but that was all.<br /><br />Billy Connoly's archaeology professsor character is a disgrace to the profession, claiming the Hundred year ended a century too early, and trampling all over excavation sites.<br /><br />Thankfully the good Prof goes missing before he does history any further mischief. Not that you actully notice anyway, until someone tells you he has been gone for 2 weeks.<br /><br />The characters are poorly developed, and are usually killed before you can get to know them.<br />Those that aren't spend most of thier time climbing on buildings, and smashing up walls. One decides to rescue a French girl (Anna Friel with a very bad accent), from the nasty English who kill the French for sport (after having ran out of deer.)<br /><br />The film relies on non-stop action, as opposed to telling good storytelling.<br />So for two hours the baddies chase peasants, stab people, burn houses and dangle women from battlements. All because they are English of course. Reason enough.
B002MJV75O|1.0|Woww the package looks nice, but after the Complete 3rd Season on DVD I became dissapointed about the DVD realeses, just didn't like the new music, could TPTB notice that all the Creek fans ( Creekers, which I'm proudly part of) loved not only the whole story but also the music , the only way to buy this set will be that the episodes were just like the ones airing on the reruns.
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|This is the best Gov't Mule studio album in a long while.   Maybe it was the help and presence of Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top that inspired Warren Haynes and company. Maybe it is the new bass player. Maybe it is a return to the Mule's Hendrix / Cream - inspired roots. Whatever it is, it sure sounds great. If you are a Mule fan, or a fan of blues-rock in general, you will love this album !  While you're at it, go see some live Mule !

B002NXSRX4|4.0|I don't know what it is yet. I've tried to figure it out but so far nothing. I go into these types of movies knowing they could be stupid (Transformers 2) or disappointing (Watchmen). I'm not expecting much...I mean, if I want Oscar performances or something with meaning I'll got to an art house movie theater and catch something indie.    Whatever the reason, this movie just took me along for the ride and kept me entertained the whole way. Maybe it's the great action throughout...maybe it's the awesome marital arts between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow...maybe it's the toned down hotness of Scarlett and the Baroness (they tease with their beauty, no need for anything excessive here). The movie grabs you with early action and keeps going. The story unfolds with tossed in highlights of the pasts of a handful of the characters so you can understand what's going on but doesn't waste any more time than is necessary. Looking for feelings and emotion? The touchy-feelly aisle is over there. This movie's just here to entertain and keep you guessing in places.    Meanwhile the tech is great even if some of it is infeasible. But even that...I'm a military junkie so when things get out of hand, it's hard not to notice...here, I didn't mind it (okay, it was bugging me a bit at the end with the jet but that's beside the point).    The movie's a fun ride and gets you there without wasting too much time on boring scenes the director wanted in there for some unknown reason. The plot is actually not bad considering but it's irrelevant in the end. This is about GI Joe vs Cobra (or what will become Cobra) and you're here to have fun.    My only complaint about this (I got both Blu-Ray and standard DVD versions, by the way so this applies to both--what can I do, we don't have Blu-Ray in the living room) is how they started packaging these movies. It used to be that when you saw \\"2 Disk Set + Digital Copy\\" that meant you got 2 Disks of content and a digital copy on one of the disks or on aseparate disk. Now, they're still calling it a 2-disk set but the second disk has all of 2, count them, 2 special features (a making of and a sfx doc). Especially with Blu-Ray...the whole idea is the disks include more storage space so you can fit the HD version but also fit a lot of other content.     To me, a film this big deserves the extra content and that needs to include a lot more than two featurettes. Honestly, let me download the digital copy or something and give me more like gag reels, docs on other parts of the behind the scenes stuff. Or else call it a 1 Disk + Digital Copy set and call it a day. Need another disk for the digital copy? Fine, charge me the extra $0.50 it costs to add the disk (including shipping!) and put it in there on a separate disk.    This is like what food retailers do with the reduced size packaging that \\"looks\\" like it hasn't changed but is thinner, taller-but-narrower, or some other deceptive format. It's obvious greed and is not appreciated, despite the price of the Blu-Ray. If it wasn't for that, I'd give this sucker a five-star rating (rare for me). If you haven't seen it and like solid action, grab this in either format.
B00068NVI4|4.0|I saw Yes during this tour in Michigan at The Palace Of Auburn Hills and it looked just like this video concert.  I loved the stage design (70's style like Yes should always look on stage) and this is a great keepsake for me.  Correct me if I am wrong but this was filmed for the PBS program \\"Soundstage\\" and you can tell that it is a first rate production in terms of the camera work.  Either they had a ton of cameras or they did their homework because the timing is great.  I think all Yes concerts should be staged this way because Yes are bigger than life and they deserve it.  Any music lover would enjoy this and of course it is a must for any Yes fan.  I wonder if Jon will ever get back with them for one more monster tour (hopefully with a new album with classic Yes music to bring them back on top again.  Jon said he was working on new stuff so you never know.
0141439475|4.0|Although I've never seen any of the Frankenstein movies, I was pretty sure that just growing up in the United States I had a pretty firm cultural grasp on the Frankenstein story.  It turns out I was completely wrong; this story was very surprising to me!<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein, a scientist, always wanted to make a mark on the world.  When he was given the opportunity to do some research and experiments on his own, he applied some information he'd read in some books and reanimated a corpse.  Or, possibly, a collection of corpses sewn together.  Frankenstein is never completely forthcoming on how his monster came to be.<br /><br />Once the reanimation is successful, though, Frankenstein finds himself confronted with a huge, ugly, fully alive monster.  While Frankenstein has a nervous breakdown and is ill for months, the monster is set loose on the world.<br /><br />By the time Frankenstein recovers and tracks down his monster, the monster has developed a startling self-awareness.  He hates himself and his creator, and demands that Frankenstein somehow make things right.  Frankenstein isn't sure that he can or should give into the monster's demands, though.<br /><br />This book was much less a scary horror story, and more a story of psychology.  We are invited to think about the reasons why Frankenstein would feel compelled to create this monster in the first place, and then to think about what should be done with a creature who is self-aware and so unhappy about his place in the world.  What should Frankenstein's obligation be to this monster that he created?
1595141715|5.0|Within 13 seconds you'll be hooked...once you begin the story, you won't want to answer the phone, look at your computer or do the dishes.    The premise is deceptively simple -- a high school junior arrives home to find a mysterious shoebox full of tapes awaiting him.  The tapes have been sent to him by a classmate who committed suicide two weeks earlier.  The pace of the book is quick, but the emotional impact will haunt you long after you've finished the last page.    As an educational advocate and someone who works with young adults, I found the book to be an eye-opener.  Yes, young people can be sensitive -- they can also be incredibly insensitive.  When a lack of self-discipline is allowed to fester, the consequences can be devastating.    So the 13 reasons to read this book:  13. It will allow you a better understanding of high schoolers - your own and others.  12. The writing is solid and won't let you down.  11. It will make you re-think the way you act toward others.  10. The evil of gossip cannot be stressed enough and this book shows why.  9. The characters are real enough to practically touch and hear.  8. The tone of the book is unique.  7. Once you read it, you will want to loan this book out again and again or recommend it to others.  6. If you write, this will teach you to be a better writer.  5. If you teach, it may help you to become a better teacher  4. If you're a parent, you won't look at your child the same way again.  3. Like any great book or film, you will be haunted by the story for weeks.  2. Did I mention the writing is really solid?  1. You'll say 'thank you' after reading it.

B000R34V50|4.0|A great movie that brings back the turtle nostalgia of the 90's when we were younger. I am no turtle fanatic, just a fan as a kid (and a die hard movie analyst). There is some serious CGI & Visuals in this movie if you know what to look for, some of the best out there. The story is not bad either; I would have liked to see more of Michaelangelo and Donatello. There are some good fighting scenes that are very detailed and visual as well. This movie is very different than the real movies of the 90's. In a way, it is more enjoyable than the real movies, which had a \\"poor puppetry\\" feel to them (except the first movie). If you have a top end TV (1080p 120hz +), Blu-Ray Player and good cables, you will enjoy the fine detail that went into this Blu-Ray movie. Otherwise, the regular DVD would probably be just as good.
B0024RID60|3.0|I remember cranking this up the summer of 78' when I graduated.  I think \\"Shattered\\" was the one that got us the most.  Then Lucy made them take her likeness off the cover which made the original LP cover a collectable.  I have the remastered CD version from years ago that replicates the LP which slides into the open end of the plastic jeweled case.  Dont know if they do it that way anymore for this one.  Other Stones CD's are just LP replicas which is fine by me now that I can store them and keep the original safe on my shelf.

B001AQR3E4|4.0|Interview With the Vampire is a great vampire film. It is based on the Anne Rice novel of the same title.It begins in modern day San Francisco when a reporter interviews a man who claims to be a vampire. Then the vampire begins to tell his story.

B00007LTIA|4.0|This is a good album made better by the studio run thru's and the restored beginning of the first cut which is now longer.  I love what Rhino is doing to all the Yes albums and they are giving the ones with Roger Dean covers extra special packaging.  The sound is very good but I have not compared it to the Atlantic remastered version by Joe.  It does not matter to me because this version will end up being superior because of the packaging and the extra tracks. Get this before they do away with deluxe package.

B002OR18HQ|5.0|Wow. It is truly inspiring to see John Fogerty and band play through this set of Fogerty and CCR classics, as well as a few well-chosen covers. Fogerty jumps around the stage with such joy that it's contagious. His voice is in amazing shape and his guitar chops are more impressive than ever. I highly recommend this concert video. In addition to sounding great, it's visually stunning as well.

1906694168|5.0|Very enjoyable conclusion to the Millennium trilogy. Addictive and hard to put down. Lots of names to keep up with, but tale is told clearly. I am very sad there isn't another book coming out. Like other folks, I ordered mine from Amazon.uk. Why aren't there global release dates for books?!

0385504225|1.0|Lost Symbol is a bad book. I agree with Justin Lee's comments on every point but this: it is a bad book. Could it be rescued by a good editor? Probably. I enjoyed DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons. I did not enjoy Lost Symbol. Characters are one dimensional, especially Sato. In every conversation she has with Langdon she acts like an idiot. The other characters are not any better, just different in their own one dimensional way. The book does not move; it is dull. It is tedious and repetitive. Characters are constantly saying the same things: what the hell, what could it mean... Mal'akh's tattoos are straight from Michael's in Prison Break. Dialogue and descriptions are so prosaic; the language is dead.  There are some positives, however.   The book's description of the Library of Congress is amazing; I was fascinated by Dürer's magic square and the allusion to alchemical principles including \\"as above, so below\\"; and I enjoyed the historical evidence for the masonic involvements of America's founders. But the main published reviews are right about Brown's reticence to tell us anything insightful about the Masons. This book is just a huge disappointment. I will probably not read Brown again.
B002MW50KY|4.0|I really like this! and I'm not a Dylan fan. I do not understand why all the fuss about this new work of Dylan, some unnecessarily, like Michael Medved really thrashed it in his review.<br /><br />Many of the songs are performed with such unusual style, but they really grow on you. The sound is not traditional but often charming and sometimes funny. so I won't be listening to Bob on Christimas eve or Christiams Day, but I will during the season.

0061231401|5.0|At last...I think Rollin's latest thriller \\"The Doomsday Key\\" is his best so far.  After reading several other of his books, I always thought they started off way too slowly and THEN got exciting.  Not so with Doomsday, from the first few pages Wham! then Bam! then a sucker punch!  Heck, I was sweating a few times reading the darn thing.  Other reviewers have commented on the storyline so I will refrain from adding more EXCEPT by golly if you want a book to read on a long flight or one to get you thinking than Doomsday is for YOU!  Roger over and OUT.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is definitely one of the best, if not the best returning show on TV this year. With the incredibly smart and witty banter between Fillion's Rick Castle and Katic's Det. Kate Beckett, the chemistry between them is impalpable. The writing in the show is just, in lack of a better term, \\"extraordinary\\". The mix between comedy and drama is just right, and the acting is spot on. What I love most about this show is not just the relationship between Castle and Beckett, but the relatinoship Castle shares with his daughter and mother. It is most refreshing to see such a level-headed teenager on television who is mature enough to take care of herself and knows when to ask for help. The supporting cast in this show is just as impressive as the main stars. Molly Quinn shines as Castle's daughter, Alexis, and Susan Sullivan is perfectly cast as Castle's mother. Jon Huertas, Seamus Dever, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and Tamala Jones also add lots of fun and drama to the show. All in all, this show is a definite keeper and I hope it continues for a very long time!
B00005RG6B|5.0|You know, some things get better with age.  Some things get better with multiple viewings.  This does both.  I've owned this about 5 weeks, and am on my 3rd viewing as I am typing this (on the song \\"The Needle Lies\\").  This is just plain awesome.  It is almost better than the album, if that is possible.  These guys are a great studio band, but the album doesn't capture the electricity and the all out tour de force that is the Queensryche live show.  This has yet to get old.  Twenty years on, great album, great concept, great live show.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Truly one of the funniest shows on TV right now. This \\"mockumentary\\" comedy series was created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan, people behind Frasier and Just Shoot me and is just as funny as these two. Multinational, multisexual and exceedingly complicated (extended) family and their hilarious antics filmed by the Dutch TV crew.     Jay Pritchett (Ed O'Neill - he is back!!!) is the track-suit wearing oldest member of the family who is married to a Columbian goddess Gloria (Sofía Vergara), who brings her son Manny into the family.    Jay's Daughter Claire (Julie Bowen) a neurotic mother is married to Phil (Ty Burrell), a very awkward,  know-it-all dad (he is not) and their 3 kids.    Jay's gay son Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and his partner Cameron (Eric Stonestreet), who just adopted a Vietnamese baby.    Show consists of great characters, excellent cast and expertly written scripts. This show is funniest on any network. Start with the pilot, you will love it.
B000LC55F2|4.0|The movie is fast moving and captures your interest from the very beginning. There are numerous twists and turns that come together at the end. I particularly like the historical part of the movie where Tesla entered the a central part of the theme and you saw the competition with Edison. I found the movie most enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone who like magic.
B001PO53IO|5.0|The sound and picture quality on these disks is amazing. I'm truly blown away by it on my 1080p tv. Also, the aspect ratio of these episodes is different than the broadcast versions. On tv they cut off part of the sides, even though it is presented in widescreen on tv. The blu-ray episodes have an aspect ratio closer to the Films.    I'm really enjoying the extras they go into a lot of detail and explain some really cool things. Also, some of the bad (jar jar and fart jokes). The best part of the special features is getting to see clips from the films in 1080i for the first time. I Cannot wait for that blu-ray boxset! The Jedi Archives special features are really enjoyable too but for the concept art you can't select things to zoom on which stinks if you have a small tv. Even on my 42\\" some things are still too tiny to see as big as I would like.    The box everything comes in is top quality too. It's kind of like the whole thing is a book you open it up there's production notes and concept art in a booklet attached to the case. Disk 1 is on the front and the back has Disks 2 and 3 stacked on each other (like many boxsets do these days).    Overall it's a fantastic set that does exactly what it should. I wish there was a full commentary for the episodes but getting a 7min featurette per 20 minute is a good replacement. Also, i wish there were full behind the scenes features not just ones for specific episodes. But they have all of that on the Clone Wars movie set so it's understandable. Hopefully the Season Two set includes those kinds of things.     - PS: my first set came with Disk 1 and 2 copies of Disk 2. But Amazon sent me the replacement and i got it within 24 hours so no harm done.
1407109421|3.0|This book begins as interesting adventure in otherworld, like ours but not quite like it. It continues as pleasant read with allusions that are a bit subversive, and main idea, which religious people won't like, is discovered somewhere along the way.    This looks like children's book but it isn't really.     I would not recommend this to kids, especially if their parents want to educate them in Christian spirit.     Okay, I made a lame joke, but point is, I would recommend book to adult people whose attitude is formed and who are not afraid to hear other people's opinion.     All in all, a good read whose strong point is not in shocking religious people but combining several fresh ideas on theology, philosophy and some other fields.    A book for forming young atheists OR interesting opinion? You decide.     Oh, and there is a passage at the end of third book I overlooked which is cleverly put there. Main idea is well hidden. First two books are really easy to read, but third has some puzzles worth thinking. End of first book has also important lord Azrael's monologue and second book has importand Mary's dialogue with *SPOILER OMITTED* using supercomputer she did research on.
0375434526|5.0|I've read Davinci Code and Angels and Demons-but this book was my favorite of the three.  I was \\"hooked\\" in the first chapter and couldn't stand to put it down until it was finished.  Plus, the message was a good one.
0783232039|5.0|The best Chucky film and the highest grossing one making over 50 million dollars at the boxoffice, \\"The Bride of Chucky\\" brought renewed interest to the Chucky franchise. Jennifer Tilly steals the film as Chucky's new bride Tiffany who brings Chucky back to life. Tiffany eventually becomes a doll and the two go on a murderous rampage in the northeast, sort of like the doll version of \\"Thelma and Louise\\". The movie is intelligent, dark, funny, well-acted, and suspenseful, and horror buffs will love the chemistry between the two dolls. Another Chucky film, \\"The Seed of Chucky\\", followed, but was not a hit despite the presence of Jennifer Tilly. Nick Stabile, mostly known for a small role on the soap opera \\"Sunset Beach\\", plays a guy with whom the human Tiffany flirts with. He also shows off his amazing abs that will enlighten him to the female and gay audience that strive for horror films. The DVD comes with feature commentary, interviews, and the trailer.

Perhaps it's the easiest way to release the  only two tracks the band has recorded lately.    Go listen to the Pocketwatch Album,  and the Foo demos back when Dave was   young, aggresive, and mostly rockin'!    ... or buy this album and listen to it with your niece.

B000WXVJ6Y|2.0|I downloaded this album thinking it would be as good as her last album. I'm quite disappointed. Yummy is absolutely annoying as well as a lot of other songs on it. What happened to her funk and creativity? I know she could do better than this. I'm starting to think about taking this album off my MP3 but maybe my 7 year old will like it. I'll just stick with her older albums and I don't recommend this to anyone over 20 - seems like a teen album.

It's one of those DVDs that you can stick in anytime, in any place, and be mesmerized by.  If you would love to see places that most of us will only dream of ever seeing, this is a wonderful purchase.
B0021L8US0|5.0|** SPOILERS **    When I went to see this I fully expected it to be a typical sci-fi movie about man vs. an alien invasion with special effects being the dominating trait. And usually one can then only hope it has a good story too. And, in fact, this movie does live up to all those qualifiers. But it turns out to be much, much more.    This IS a story about an alien 'invasion', but only in the sense that a group of sick aliens need to have a place to live, so they are intruding on our space and economy. It shows how when any group that share a bond are forced to live geographically together in poverty, that gangs become the norm. This makes sense, since it truly is a(t first) just a step towards organizing to make productivity of the group increase due to the more efficient nature of organizaton. But then it gets out of hand due to power struggles and greed. Weapons become very important.    As such, they have, amazingly, been able to represent at least three different existing real-life 'factions' in one alien race. Apartheid is the most obvious and blantant, especially when you consider the geographic location the majority of the movie takes place in. I've already mentioned gangs. And finally, there are the homeless. When the officials early on are evicting aliens, the absurdity of how we deal with homeless people is made crystal clear. It is common to tell them they can't stay 'here', when obviously their only alternative is to find another 'here' they will eventually be asked to move on from. Aliens make it clear such people have no way to get home. They are truly homeless (short of the goal of the movie to reactivate their ship).    Also, it is a very sfx dominated movie. But in the very best way. They spent most of their effort on making the aliens real, and it definitely works. Christopher is, in my humble opinion, THE best CGI character in any film ever. Yes, I know they use live actors to act as placeholders, but the end result is pure CGI in that nothing visual of the actors remain in the final cut.    It is NOT your typical sci-fi, but has some typical elements. It is much more sophisticated than most of what is out there. This movie proves sci-fi can have great depth and still maintain all the things we tend to love in such movies (e.g., action sequences). It has a very obvious message. Though it gives no solution, it is merely observational. But this is fair, if a movie could solve such world problems, then the world problems would not exist to make the movie about!     In that sense, this movie is more like 'Bladerunner' than it is 'Alienation', the one it seems to be compared to the most. The story is more of a vehicle to let us observe the conditions of District 9. Both D9 and 'Alienation' do have the same premise, but that's it. They both are about the derelicts of an alien race being dumped on the doorstep of a sympathetic people, and the conflicts this can cause when the honeymoon is over. But beyond that, they are completely different. There is no 'master race'. No 'drug' that slaves are given. But more to the point, 'Alienation's message is 'don't do drugs', while D9's message is 'the world has prejudice and stereotyping issues that seriously need to be dealt with'.     I knew almost from the beginning this movie was going to be special. The documentary approach they took was a great way to give us the info we need, and remain constantly entertaining. The way they mixed documentary-like footage with typical movie production scenes was done wonderfully. Like I said, it keeps us more involved, since we tend to enjoy change over monotany. The integration of the aliens into the movie is virtually seamless. Except for the fact we know these aliens and their spaceship and technology can't actually exist, it doesn't take long before one forgets they aren't real. While this movie has a lot of elements that many people might find offensive (e.g., parents), the gore and language and violence is actually used quite appropriately. That all this was done for a significantly lower budget than your typical sci-fi sfx movie is cause for one big 'bravo!'.    I will end with my favorite aspect of the movie. The guy who played the protagonist did an AMAZING job! Especially considering this was the first time he ever acted (except for a short film done to sell the D9 concept). He was just suppose to be a producer on the film! His ability to go from the nerd-like personality he had in the beginning, and then show how self-preservation always dominates as an instinct, was almost seamlessly.     Personally, I'd put this movie up for best picture and best actor. And if it existed, best CGI character. It should still win some awards We'll see!    The movie does have a point that makes a sequel almost a must, and I can't wait to see it if this becomes a reality!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Much has been written on these pages as to whether purchasing The Beatles In Mono is worth it or not, and why. I'd like to hopefully add a bit more color, but not before first answering the key question.    In a nutshell, if you are a very casual Beatles fan who will listen to their songs in a non-critical way, then the investment isn't worth it. You will be more than happy with the re-mastered stereo mixes, which sound wonderful, are much less expensive, and can be purchased separately.    But if you have more than just a casual interest in the Beatles, and you are looking for the definitive statement of their art, then you simply must invest in these recordings. I'll explain why in more detail, but in short this is the sonic experience the Beatles and George Martin crafted, and it is often tremendously superior to the better known stereo counterparts.    A brief moment first on the current unfortunate situation for Beatles fans who are simply trying to build a reference collection of the music of the World's Greatest Band: in the least, it is tremendously frustrating, and at worst it feels like being on the receiving end of a well-orchestrated swindle. Why is there not an \\"Everything\\" box, that delivers the entire catalog in all its permutations? Why must fans become musical Indiana Joneses, having to invest time and energy into learning the confusing landscape of available \\"collector's\\" products that all have premium, wallet-burning prices? It is my sincere hope that those in control of this catalog ultimately understand how unacceptable this is, and correct the situation.    A case in point: neither the stereo or mono box sets together represent the \\"final\\" reference collection. You need to explore more, specifically The Beatles Capitol albums Vol 1 box set, and three other albums that provide not just remasters but genuine remixes of a number of songs.     For Beatles fans, the history of the American Capitol albums is well-known. They are a bastardization of the original British product, in both packaging and audio treatment of the songs, most having been soaked in heavy reverberation that someone thought was necessary once upon a time. As a result, the American albums are considered sonically inferior, non-representative of the Beatles' intent, and are largely the domain of Beatles \\"completists\\" who simply need to own all versions of the Beatles' material. Except for one case: The American \\"Meet The Beatles\\" album, which opens with the iconic \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\". Whatever Capitol did, they did it right, and the sound on the mono version of this release, which is included in the Capitol Records box set, is simply extraordinary, far and away much better than either the mono or stereo British re-masters. Although the rest of the Capitol box set is unnecessary, it is required to get your hands on this one mono album. For me, there is no better listening for this group of songs.    Then there are the remixes, which represent a tantalizing view of what is possible in terms of highest possible sound quality. Because the Beatles worked most of their recording career using 4-track tape, they often used \\"reduction\\" mixes to create more tracks to hold all their creative ideas. They would fill up four tracks, for instance, and copy that tape to another tape, while mixing 4 tracks into 2 on the new tape, leaving two blank tracks available for more recording. Then the process might repeat again. The end result was a four track master that had instruments combined together that could no longer be isolated for sound treatment, set apart in the stereo spectrum, or rebalanced in volume level. And of course there was the loss of sound quality that comes with multiple tape copies. Modern technology offers the ability to go back to these pre-reduction tracks and synchronize them all together into a multi-track digital configuration, with full isolation and best sound quality preserved. In fact, as a safety exercise, all the Beatles material in the Abbey Road vaults has already been transferred to digital - that work is done. All that remains is to actually create the remixes, and some of this has now seen the light of day. The best example of the sonic possibilities of remixing is the Yellow Submarine soundtrack that was released ten years ago, which contains 15 songs that span several \\"normal\\" Beatles albums. Songs like \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" jump to life like never before, while \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\" and especially \\"It's All Too Much\\" are nothing short of a revelation.     There are other remixes. \\"Let It Be - Naked\\", which might be best described as Paul's long desired re-statement of the Let It Be album, is a great sounding record. Debates aside of whether Phil Spector's mix was or was not definitive, \\"Naked\\" sounds great, with a very good stereo mix.     Then there is the Beatles \\"Love\\" album, with what's referred to as \\"mash-up\\" mixes - so-called because Beatles songs here are completely re-imagined from the originals. As a soundtrack to a Cirque de Soleil show, the idea was to re-shape the songs to fit the show. They are shortened, overlaid, run backwards - all sorts of permutations. As a Beatles purist this is alarming at times, but again this is a remix and it offers a glimpse as to what is possible with the sound. Listen to \\"I Am The Walrus\\", in true stereo with pre-reduction takes: it is simply fantastic. For this album, you just need to hang your purity hat at the door and go along for the ride, which can be very rewarding.    So, \\"Yellow Submarine Soundtrack\\", \\"Let It Be - Naked\\", and \\"Love\\" are all essential. This review is not the time or place to debate the religion of whether remixes are \\"ethical\\" in regards to Beatles material. Let's just say for now it is a vital glimpse into the possibilities, and frankly a preview of where the next frontier of Beatles releases will be - a fully remixed catalog. And hopefully 24 bit as well, which is another story...    Which finally brings us to the Mono Box.    I'm not going to provide a song by song analysis, or better said I won't give you a very exhaustive one. Having listened to these CDs several times each now, my thoughts have coalesced around what it really is that I find most striking about them, and that is the Beatles sound like a BAND in mono, rather than \\"recording artists\\".    Going back to the 60's, which I remember as a child, you have the first appearance of stereo playback equipment in people's homes: huge pieces of furniture with left and right speakers separated by a few feet, often with Reverberation effects available to add to the music. As this was all brand new stuff, stores would sell stereo \\"sampler\\" albums that were filled with nothing but sound effects designed to show off stereo separation. Things like footsteps that simply panned from one channel to the other. Extremely trivial now, of course, but incredibly cool then. This was the stereo home listening environment that existed when the Beatles were at their peak, and it is clear that the extreme stereo mixes prepared by Abbey Road engineers were meant to function in-part as a type of stereo sampler, to show off the separation that was possible. These mixes, which have become the de-facto reference standard that we best know, were done for the most part after the Beatles and George Martin left the studio, and are an approximation of their original mono mixes, splashed out in extreme stereo. As stereo became the dominant playback medium, these mixes eventually became the only form most of us would hear the songs in. As such, I think this historical accident has shaped an opinion of the Beatles as sort of an \\"intellectual recording artist\\" group, which turned songs inside out that sounded downright trippy on headphones. The Sgt Pepper album represents the height of this form - I can clearly recall many, many reviews that spoke of the stereo imaging as part of the \\"acid trip\\" of this album.    But it wasn't George Martin's or The Beatles acid trip, and this was never their original vision.    The Beatles in mono are a rock band, the greatest rock band that ever existed. Sgt Pepper is not an acid trip, it's a driving, pulsating, rocking masterpiece. Songs leap from the album, especially the wind up on the original vinyl side 2 that leads to \\"Day In The Life\\". \\"Lovely Rita\\", \\"Good Morning\\", and especially \\"Sgt Pepper Reprise\\" are intense and riveting. Paul's bass and Ringo's drums love the center channel, which is where they always belonged. Close your eyes, and the band is right in front of you. This experience doesn't happen listening to the \\"cerebral\\" stereo mix. \\"Day In The Life\\" itself is different - more emotional, more powerful. The resolution from John to Paul's middle-8 part feels like jumping off a speeding car - you scramble to re-orient yourself. The urgency is remarkable.    And it's not just that the mix is folded together in the middle - it's a different mix. The instruments are more carefully placed. The vocals sit a little lower, bringing greater accent to the music. There's Mal Evans shouting a countdown in \\"Day In The Life\\" - it is adding to the tension. The guitars sear across.  This is the genius of George Martin.    Other examples abound, with my absolute favorite being \\"Dear Prudence\\" on the White Album. Similar in texture to the stereo mix for the first couple of minutes, something amazing happens towards the end. The drums begin to stagger, and change to a roll through the last verse. Yeh, that's on stereo too, but not like this - the effect is  driving the song right through the wall. Guitar riffs ride over this like bright rays of light, and John holds it together with a vocal containing a newly detected pleading emotion. By the time the drums switch back to straight time, it comes as a massive release of tension - a virtuoso band performance. I had goose bumps listening to it, realizing that after all these years I was actually hearing one of my favorite Beatle songs for the first time.     Revolver has special moments as well. You will never appreciate Taxman in stereo again after hearing the exciting mono version. And the ending of the record, with Paul's \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" leading into John's \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", is fantastic. These mixes are completely different and markedly superior to the stereo.     The list goes on, and since many have written about them in detail in other reviews, no need to go further.    So - does that mean that mono is \\"better\\" than stereo? It surely is better in that it represents the Beatles original vision of the songs. But does it sound better? That will always have a subjective answer. I am partial to hearing the slower Beatle songs in stereo, particularly harmony-laden ones. I particular like softer portions of \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" presented as extras in the box set with their original 1965 stereo mixes that were re-done in 1987. The point is, you need both. They are both a part of the Beatles legacy, and musical history - the products of their time. The rocking Beatles in mono, the intellectual Beatles in stereo.     One final note, also mentioned elsewhere, is that the mono box set thankfully did not get caught up in the CD volume wars that are raging out there. Frankly the Beatles used a lot of compression to start with - no need for more. As a result, the louder you turn up the volume, the better these disks sound!    Maybe one day all this reference material will be pulled neatly together, so it can be more easily accessed and appreciated. But that is just a packaging complaint. At least the package exists, and we now have it available to us. I encourage and recommend any serious listener of The Beatles to get the mono box set and enjoy!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw the movie on November 1 and like others, I want to see it again and again.  Of course we all know Michael Jackson was unbelievably talented and I wanted to see his talent one more time and get a \\"backstage\\" look into the rehearsal.    As the minutes tick by you will be drawn further and further into the excitement, creative talent, and gentle kindness of Michael.  The dancing is beyond belief, the dancers are worth the price of admission.      There is a part of the movie and I have no idea what to call it, it is a new song with the video showing how horribly we are destroying the world in a way that makes you want to jump up and scream \\"NO!\\"    You will not be able to sit through the entire movie without tapping your toes and moving in your seat.  In the end, however, there is overwhelming sadness for the loss of the greatest performer of all time.      It is very emotional on many levels; when I left the theatre I felt dazed, a sort of \\"where I am?\\" feeling because for 2 hours, you left your universe and became a part of something much greater.
0786868724|5.0|What a lovely book!  This was the first time I have read a book by Mitch Albom, but certainly not my last.  This book touches the heart of what brings us together as human beings and the power that comes from serving others.  Mitch takes us on his own spiritual journey, but in such a way that it becomes our spiritual journey as well.      There are so many stories to be told, so many lives that have been touched by a single human being serving with love.  Thank you Mitch for reminding us that we should not be so quick to point out our differences but instead seek to find what we have in common.

B000AJIF4E|2.0|it's about ok level, slightly below than that. it's value should be about $20~25. I'm a serious music fan. I enjoy from Classical, Country, POP, Rock, all the way towards Death Metals. Find sony branded headphones with red tags in TJ maxx or other stores liquidation carts. THE SOUND IS CHEAP. besides, the cord is not so strong.
0385504225|1.0|I was going to give this book a two star rating, but I just can't do it, it doesn't deserve one star.  Let me first say that I did like The Davinci Code, it was a page-turner with a gripping and only moderately absurd plot.  The Lost Symbol is just ridiculous.  Typical Dan Brown formula, Super-menacing bad guy, overly-elaborate yet mildly entertaining puzzles and every turn in the plot has \\"earth shattering\\" consequences.  It feels like Dan Brown cranked this out just so they could make a movie out of it, and a bad movie at that.  One final observation, The last few chapters are AWFUL.  All of the preposterous buildup fizzles away into bitter frustration.  I think I am done with Dan Brown, just terrible.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Many think a Greatest Hits release is just the record company cashing in on music that fans already own or that the Greatest Hits omits what they consider to be the best tracks and for some the Foo Fighters Greatest Hits may be looked on in this way. You will never please everyone!     For me, if most of the tracks are ones I would include in a playlist taken from the band's many albums, then the Greatest Hits is probably just that and with this release that is certainly the case.     The good thing about the Foo Fighters music is that whether released as a single or not their \\"Hits\\" ar really the best of their album tracks, some happen to have achieved commercial succcess, other great songs getting no air play at all but all are great examples of the band's music.     From hit tracks like the 'Pretender from Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace through to This is a Call and Big Me from their debut release, Foo Fightes, this is the band at their best, a great representation of the Foo Fighter's first 15 years and a great cd for those that want a first taste of the band, are casual fans or already have the music but want a listen to the best without changing from CD to CD.     To top it off, and selling in Australia at the same price as a normal new release CD, comes a second DVD disc containing all the Greatest Hits Videos so you can listen while watching your heros and enjoying the warped humour that has become a trademark of the bands releases over the years.     Great value and highly recommended!
B00280LYHS|5.0|this book is exiting and entertaing. a great way to end the series and i cant wait for the lighting thief to coem out in theaters.
B002MRROKI|5.0|This live set is substantially better than [[ASIN:B000000OVZ From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah]] in my opinion. Maybe this is because it contains more tracks originally found on [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]], which has to be one of my favorite albums of the 90s, and potentially of all time. Maybe this is because the sound quality of this album is just better than the 1996 effort. Maybe it's because it contains other live versions of the very same music found on \\"Muddy Banks\\" that I'm thrilled to rediscover after leaving that CD stuck on the shelf for years.<br /><br />Fact of the matter that this new release reminded us all that Nirvana was and still is a rock legend. As far as I can remember, it was in 1992 that the band was on top of their game, by the spotlight everywhere showing all they were all about. And this concert at Reading festival in that year is one great capture of that moment.<br /><br />\\"Territorial Pissings\\", the last track, containing an attempt by Kurt to play \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", is an amazing end to this release. Nirvana fans, don't wait to get this one more album to your collection.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I will always rmemeber that day when I heard the news of Michael Jacksons death I remember where I was ... when my son called me...Michael and I had a long relationship over 35 years of music and dancing I was a fan of his and will always be. His music was timeless and always made you smile no matter what, and it got you up to dance, to move your body, and listening to him always made you feel good. His talent was endless.His life unfortunatly was not. We kill our icons we kill them with overwhelming adoration and expect them to be perfect he became it and was miserable being so famous he was not a happy soul.,he had a dark side to him that no one expected.  We tend to put these celebrities on pedestals and than they fall however we could of helped him but we caged him forever to be the reclusive man that he became. Emotional pain can determine how one treats themselves, and he self medicated himself into oblivion because to be him in his shoes was too painful to even imagine, after the embarrassment of what he endured.  Thank you Randy Ortega for this last documentary of this icon, it was great and I really enjoyed it. It made you realize what a perfectionist Michael was about his craft you could see how over the years he was thinner and frailer than he was years ago. The sunglasses showed a man who wanted to disappear this was the other side to Michael. He worked long hours, was out of breath, during some vocal numbers and if you did not know what he had died from, maybe no one would of knowticed it. I saw him as a desperate man wanting this to work out so bad... but drugs had become his master and after rehersals he probably went home in pain wanting to sleep because of the stress of it all. He was not really hoping for a comeback take a look at the title it says it all...This is it go an see it ...a reminder of days gone by.. the magic ended but the last film will forever be etched in our minds.
B002NXSRX4|3.0|Okay..the acting was terrible. Especially the lead character who seemed to clench his jaws every time he was in a scene.<br />The special effects, which I think they had to many for the producers to manage, were almost laughable at times. Have to say that<br />some of the visual were stunning though. Transformers 2 knocked this one out of the park.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|This movie is perhaps the most mixed bag of a flick I've ever seen. It has some good points, and bad points, and a lot of in-between. But this fully 180 minute movie is so sprawling and disjointed in its epic sort of way that it's hard to know where to start.<br /><br />So before writing this review, I read some of the 1 star and 5 star reviews just to see what the extremes were like, and some of the negative ones are quite negative and others quite funny, such as the Australian reviewer who called it a bunch of kangaroo dung, and another reviewer who said the movie is sort of like Gone with the Wind meets The Road Warrior. LOL. On the other hand, many of the 5 star reviews compare it to some of the great adventure epics of earlier years.<br /><br />Well, a great movie it is not, but I wouldn't call it a bunch of kangaroo dung, either. For me I would have to say the bottom line is that the movie, although it had a lot of potential, just doesn't quite get off the ground, for several reasons. Set against the backdrop of the rugged cattle ranching culture of the Northern Territory, the clash of cultures between the white man and the aborigines, and the impending Japanese bombing of Darwin, there was certainly a lot of potential for real drama, action, and emotion. But the disjointed story line is too patchy and disorganized. It's as if the director was trying to do too much, and in doing so failed to deal with any one subject really well.<br /><br />For example, one problem was the attempt to positively portray the aboriginal culture which just comes off as superficial and contrived. Another is the romance between Jackman and Kidman's characters, which falls somewhat flat, although not completely so, but they just don't seem to have a whole lot of chemistry together. There are too many characters in the film to really develop well, and as a result they all end up a bit too stereotypical and shallow and you don't care about any of them.<br /><br />Many people complained about the many CGI generated scenes and backdrops that looked too fake and cheesy but I didn't mind that too much; there was enough beautiful cinematography to compensate for that, and in fact, the cinematography is one of the strong points of the film. You get a good feel for the Australian countryside and it's sheer size, beauty, and dangers. I'm just sorry the rest of the movie didn't work out better.<br /><br />As for the acting, Hugh Jackman is convincing as the laconic but intrepid drover who helps save Kidman's ranch, but Kidman's character (an aristocratic blueblood from England) is too melodramatic and over the top. No doubt pre-WWII Australia wasn't exactly the Ritz, but Kidman seems to spend half of the movie with a look of sheer horror plastered on her face at the barbarity and primitiveness of the place.<br /><br />Finally, much of the dialog is lackluster and just falls flat, although Jackman and Kidman try valiantly to make it work. And the sound track, although there are some nice sections, overall just didn't add much to the movie.<br /><br />Overall, not a terrible movie but one that fell considerably short of its potential. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could but I give it three here since the movie tries hard and I just like anything about Australia no matter how bad it is.enes and backdrops that looked too fake and cheesy but I didn't mind that too much; there was enough beautiful cinematography to compensate for that, and in fact, the cinematography is one of the strong points of the film.

B00004SZWD|5.0|It's no surprise that Elton John thinks this is the greatest album ever recorded.  Stevie Wonder and Elton John are made from the same mold (how's that for equality?), both talented pop artists whose greatest talent is making their music seem holier than it is.  The different between them is that E.J. is a decent pop artist and S.W. is a truly gifted pop artist: John's grand double-album opus, \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\\" is up and down and mostly intriguing for its flaws; Wonder's grand double-album opus is the real deal, all highs that never let up, and it comes with an E.P., too.  I'm not sure what Elton's after, if anything.  Stevie just wants everyone to get along and to see the beauty in the world, a statement he can make without the need to acknowledge its irony.  Nevertheless, \\"Black Man,\\" on which Stevie gets a little angry, is the most exciting song and sounds like the sincerest to me--but not by much.  On an album full of songs built around melody, that's something.  And since the President has named it his favorite record, add \\"patriotism\\" to its list of merits.
0307266303|5.0|This book is fabtastic on many levels. I really liked the fact that he provided the reader quite a bit of backgound and insight on the characters leading up to the race. You end up feeling like you know these people, and would like to hang  out with them (though most of us couldn't keep up if they decided to go for a \\"little jog\\", as it might be 50 miles or more).    You will probably never look at your running shoes the same way again, and may also save yourself some money in the future. I am going to start going barefoot as often as possible, as I also believe the large amount of nerve endings in the feet are there to be stimulated, not muted by thick soles.   The author has pulled together compelling evidence from scientific sources on why we became fully bipedal. This is a theory I had never heard before, and was as interesting any other part of the book.    And finally, I had to go my local Sprouts and get some Aztec Superfood to give it a try. So now I am still enjoying the book each morning by having my oatmeal and frog eggs.   Synchronicity:The Secret:The Field:Dan Brown moment:...   When I went to Sprouts, I asked someone there if they sold Chia? The sales person showed me where it was, and she went about her business. As she was stocking the shelves right there I asked her if she knew anything about Chia? No. Heard about \\"Born to Run\\"? Sorry no. So I maybe bent her ear a little about the book, the story about running shoes, bipedalism, ultra-marathons, and the power of Chia. Then mentioned the book was centered around a group of exceptional running people from Copper Canyon in Mexico. Turns out that her parents were from Copper Canyon. She made sure to write down the name of the book before I left. Maybe not Dan Brown worthy, but it seemed weird at the moment that there was this connection. I am pretty sure she will turn her parents on to the book if they don't know about it. Should be a trip for them to read!
B000002KCC|5.0|One hears talk that there are fools among us that dismiss Neil Young as a smoked-out hippie tunemeister, and to them I say \\"Tonight's the Night,\\" living proof that Young is one hard rocker.  Recorded in '73, after the deaths of Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry, it was either rejected by the label or yanked from release by Young himself; in '75, he recorded a new album, dumped it, and decided to put out \\"Tonight's the Night\\" instead.  The title song, which, split in two, bookends the record, is so full of grief on the first spin I thought Neil was about to break down crying.  Interspersed throughout the rest of the album are all sorts of expressions of alienation and unhappiness with the fame he's achieved since he went solo in '69: \\"The world on a string/Doesn't mean a thing;\\" \\"Ain't got nothing on those feelings that I had;\\" in reference to Woodstock, \\"I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day;\\" \\"I've been starvin' to be alone/And independent from the scene I've known,\\" and so forth.  He never falls into self-pity, even acknowledges in the original insert that \\"This means nothing to you.\\"  Wrong: there are a few things that mean something to everybody, and pain is one of them--pain, a feeling Young knows something about, and even ventures might be better classified as an experience.  Like this sludgefest.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Now, like a lot of people, I was really hyped up to see \\"The Dark Knight\\" when it came out a year and half ago. First day, middle of the theatre, waiting patiently and anxiously.<br />And if I am being totally honest with you, I was bored to tears.<br />I didn't really think anymore about the movie, if I'm being honest with you, until, while bored one day, sitting alone in my apartment, I noticed my roommates copy of \\"The Dark Knight\\" sitting on the top of the Blu-Ray player. I thought to myself, \\"well, maybe I was wrong and I was just letting the hype get in the way.\\" So I put it in and started it and watched the entire thing again.<br />And was once again bored to tears.<br />Now I know that many people view this film as some modern version of \\"The Godfather\\" or \\"Casablanca\\", but I just can't buy into it. What I see is a mediocre version of \\"Heat\\" with a great performance from the late Heath Ledger, but a movie where everyone else flounders with one dimensional roles and broad characterizations.<br />Of the main cast only Ledger really brings anything interesting to his role, an astonishing thing seeing as the role he has is one note throughout. Christian Bale as Batman is a dull as Val Kilmer, while Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman both appear to be cashing checks. Aaron Eckhart plays his part as Harvey Dent surprisingly well, seeing as it is a different sort of role than what I have seen him in before (Neil LaBute movies mostly), but can't do much with his transformation as Two Face. Some of that may have to do with Maggie Gyleenhaal, usually a reliable actor, who looks bored and unsure of how to play her part in this movie.<br />Storywise, I just wasn't engrossed with the story of \\"The Dark Knight\\". For the most part I wondered how much nonsense the Nolan brothers were trying to shove into one movie. The story continues on and on and seems like it's trying to say something major, but never does. To add to that, to me, it seems like anytime the narrative seems to be gaining steam, the movie throws in another action scene and it loses all narrative movement.<br />To add to that, Nolan still has yet to find out how to shoot action scenes effectively and coherantly, and problem that also plagued the superior \\"Batman Begins\\".<br />I wanted to like \\"The Dark Knight\\", I did. I just couldn't. I guess nothing is for everyone. I guess this one just isn't for me.vie throws in another action scene and it loses all narrative movement.

B000002KIE|5.0|There's little that can be said about this album that hasn't been said a million times over the past 32 years.  It is the definitive punk album, even if it isn't the best punk album; occasionally the music plods and weighs itself down.  Nevertheless, the historical and artistic importance of the record gives it a sense of militaristic power it wouldn't have from the music alone.  This time around, \\"Bodies\\" was my favorite song.  The song is, Christgau nailed it, \\"anti-abortion, anti-woman, and anti-sex,\\" and I'm at least pro-choice, wholeheartedly pro-woman, and certainly pro-sex.  I liked the song so much because I can seperate the bollocks from the music; the dangerousness of the album is that not everyone will be able to do that.  The inherent purpose of rebellion is liberation, free and full living, as expressed through countless punk albums--I mean, that's the purpose of all music, I think--and that, true rebellion, should be championed, admired, and acknowledged.  But when the purpose of rebellion becomes destruction for the sake of destroying, there's nothing good about it.  \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\" is one hell of an album, a heck of an important one, too.  Just watch out for people who think the Sex Pistols were on the same mission as the Beats.
B000002GYI|5.0|A great classic, goes nicely with \\"Radio Activity\\". Both quite different, but compatible. The two best, as far as I'm concerned, although I like \\"Tour De France\\" on occasion. Anyone who whines about this not being thrilling enough for \\"music of the future\\", isn't considering how far back this goes, and just how innovative it was. And it still sounds better than most crap out these days, even for it's comparative simplicity. But, I suppose if you live primarily on a diet of fast-food, quickly-edited CGI action movies, and like to begin every sentence with \\"Yo!\\", then this won't appeal to you.
B00275EGTW|5.0|I loved this movie. Felt like I was back in the 1970's watching a big budget Sci-fi flick. Very entertaining with an excellent, thought provoking plot. Well done!
B002OEBMN4|4.0|I'm in a state of perpetual orgasm...<br /><br />This one was worth the wait. I've been a slayer fan for over 25 years, and although a lot of the recent slayer releases were less than brilliant (especially God Hates Us All) I could never see myself losing my love for the band. Don't get me wrong, I bought each and every release, and listened to them endlessly. But they were missing that extra something that makes a great Cd.<br /><br />Then Dave came back. I mean, the other drummers were awesome, but come on... Dave Lombardo was BORN to be the drummer of slayer. This is evident in Christ Illusion, which brings back killer songwriting and riffs that make distinctive, memorable songs along with the ever-present brutality. So, after (arguably) their best album in 15 years, I was dying to hear World Painted Blood. i was like a little kid waiting for christmas morning... and santa kicked ass this year because this is some SERIOUS slayer!<br /><br />I love it... from the skullmap cover art to the signature king/hanneman leads, this is pure slayer. Yes, there are a few parts that are, let's say, self influenced (but from their most classic period...oh and that part that sounds just like the beginning of jihad), but there are also a lot of parts that make me go \\"wow, that was different! $%#@ awesome!!!\\". It's all very satisfying...it hits low and deep in some spots and blisters your face off in others. (yes, this is good!) The big question is, \\"Does it live up to Reign in Blood and South of Heaven?\\" This is difficult to answer, because you have to take into account the scene at the time, when thrash was brand new and there was an excitement and passion for this kind of music that made these releases special for everyone involved (musicans, fans, etc.) The amazing thing is, here we are decades later, and the greatest thrash band ever has just released a brand new cd that once again blows me away!!! So although I can't answer if it lives up to the classics (I'll just say it's too early to tell) I will say that this CD is amazing, and if you haven't picked it up yet you need to go get it now. or i will kill you. : D<br /><br />great job slayer, and i hope tom araya's doing better after his surgery. Can't wait to see them live again!ll say that this CD is amazing, and if you haven't picked it up yet you need to go get it now. or i will kill you. : D    great job slayer, and i hope tom araya's doing better after his surgery. Can't wait to see them live again!
B000VNMMQG|2.0|This is a powerful movie based on a true story.  It is eye-opening and poignant dealing with the Britsh slave trade.  Great acting, a very redemptive drama.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|Yes, this set is overpriced.  Yes, it would be great to get a comprehensive DVD of an entire 1969 concert.  Yes, ABKCO is once again milking vintage Stones recordings for all they're worth.  Wouldn't you?    All that being said, if you're like me and you feel everything the Stones did from '68-'72 represents the pinnacle of rock n roll, then you have to justify spending 40 bucks to get the extra content in this set.  Believe me, I wish I could retrieve most of the money I spent on post-1981 Stones material to offset the price of this set a little bit, but regardless, the new material on this set is worth my money.    For the record, the version of \\"Satisfaction\\" presented here is different from the one on Gimme Shelter, much tighter and missing Mick's rambling \\"when I wake up in the morning\\" storyline.  Great version!  The \\"Under My Thumb\\"/\\"I'm Free\\" tracks stand out for their groove.  The DVD content is scant but mesmerizing, as you'd expect from Albert Maysles, and the 56-page book was surprising well-produced, full of unseen photos and insight from the tour.  And I haven't even touched the BB King/Tina Turner disc yet.    Unearthing any new Stones material from '68-'72 is a dream come true for most fans!  I keep hoping for an official Bootleg Series release of another '69 show at some point.  Until then, this bit by bit release schedule will have to do.
0688163173|5.0|Dennis Lehane is has written alot of great novels, unfortunately to this point I hadn't read any of them. I enjoyed both movies that were made so far based off his books [[ASIN:B0001ZX0OW Mystic River (Widescreen Edition)]] & [[ASIN:B0010ZR160 Gone Baby Gone]]. For my 1st Lehane experience, I chose to read this stand alone thriller \\"Shutter Island\\"!<br /><br />\\"Shutter Island\\" is a thriller in every sense, it has mystery, alot of suspense, action and is constantly making you think. Of the 450 some reviews here at Amazon, the book has a four star average, now thats quality.<br /><br />The book won't scare you silly, but it will raise the hair on the back of your neck once or twice. Their is alot of dialogue throughout the book between the main character U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule. Lehane threw in alot of humor throughout and it ends up being relaxing to read. The twist ending was great and alot of reviewers claim to have seen it coming, maybe they did, I didn't and either way its so far twisted no one could possibly know it exactly.<br /><br />I devoured this book in a day or two and I'm definitely looking forward to the movie with Leo DiCaprio & Mark Ruffalo due out in early 2010. Dennis Lehane is a great author, if you haven't already done so, pick up one of his books soon.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended!<br /><br />Enjoy~

0439023483|5.0|Took me long enough to read this one, huh? Gosh, and what was I thinking to prolong it? I actually read this right around the big hype for Catching Fire - and I was even a bit intimidated to start it. I actually started reading it and put it down after a chapter or two (for like a day) and then I picked it up again and never put it back down until I finished it... and then I was still freaking out because I just wanted more. Luckily for me Catching Fire had just come out and I ran to my local bookstore and gobbled that one right up too.<br /><br />For those of you who don't already know, here's a quick summary of the story so you sorta get the gist of it. Katniss Everdeen is 16 years old and resides in District 12 with her mother and sister. District 12 is the poorest district in Panem (a/k/a what remains of the United States). Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and as punishment they must now choose two young tributes (one male, one female) to represent their district in what is known as THE HUNGER GAMES. Meaning 24 children will have to duke it out on live television using whatever talents (hunting, archery, strength, etc.) they have as their weapon. They will be placed in an arena that will constantly be changing with all sorts of unforeseen dangers as well as these other deadly combatants and will basically have no option but to kill or be killed.<br /><br />For Katniss and Peeta (the two tributes from District 12) - this will be no easy feat. For it's every man for himself and any feelings for each other can only be seen as a weakness. With no one to trust but herself and her instincts - it is up to Katniss to do her best and survive for the arena is ready, the tributes are deadly, and the cameras are watching...let the games begin.<br /><br />Katniss, although not always the most likeable of characters, is a force to be reckoned with. I have never been so taken in by a character before. The danger lurking at every corner, the fear, the worry - it is all so real. Peeta, although only the baker's son, is also smart and cunning and you can't help rooting for them from the start. I went through so many emotions while reading this. It was like an adrenaline rush. I will even confess that there was a time or two that I actually found myself jumping in my seat (I know, don't make fun of me) from the excitement.<br /><br />In closing, I will say this: This book is simply kick ass! If you don't already own a copy - do yourself a favor and get your hands on one pronto. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.lthough only the baker's son, is also smart and cunning and you can't help rooting for them from the start.

B002IKLZZY|5.0|starts the movie off with a bang !!  Those famous initial growling notes of drums and deep violins building to the wonderful pulsating rhythm. This movie combines the best of everyone's talents; Grant, Mason, Hitch, Hermann, the screenwriters, the editing, the wonderful late 50's icons such as the Plaza hotel, the Phipps mansion in Long Island, the New York Central's luxury 20th Century Limited, the Ambassador Hotel, and finally Mount Rushmore. And lets not forget all those wonderful big gas guzzling Lincolns and Cadillacs.     It is no surprise that this movie was a box office mega hit when it came out and has been in continuous availability ever since and one of the five most popular movies on Turner network. And now it's on BluRay. I just love it !!
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown's previous books were entertaining thrillers. This one contains the previous books' thriller formula, but the writing is bloated, and in hind sight, you get the feeling you just wasted your time reading it. Hopefully, this review will help you avoid the same mistake.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I ordered this DVD recently, and have been doing the workouts for a little over two weeks.  I've already lost 6 pounds and I feel great.  I like Jillian's no-nonsense attitude.  I was walking 5-6 miles daily before I started this DVD and had lost some weight but not as much as I wanted.  The first day I truly thought I was going to drop dead, but now I can do the advanced version of Level 1 and am progressing on Level 2.  I switch between the two workouts so that it doesn't get boring.  The only (minor) complaints are having to sit through the intro stuff every day and the terrible music.  But what I do is start the DVD while I'm in the other room changing into my workout stuff, and by the time I come back the intros are done and I can just pick what I want from the menu.  The music?  Well, I could work out with the TV muted but I like hearing Jillian's encouragement so I just put up with it.  Usually I'm working too hard to mind it, and only really notice at the beginning and the end.  All in all, a small price to pay for such a great workout!

1401323820|4.0|The concept of the ABC television program \\"Castle\\" is straight-forward. Richard Castle, world famous mystery novelist, pulls strings and gets himself assigned a tagalong role with the NYPD, specifically Detective Kate Beckett and her squad. Beckett, in turn, serves as the inspiration of Castle's new book series starring Nikki Heat. As season two opens, the first Nikki Heat book, Heat Wave, is on the shelves and making waves.    In a clever bit of meta-promotion, ABC hired someone (createor Andrew Marlowe?) to write the actual Heat Wave book and attribute it to Richard Castle. Nice, huh? Being a huge fan of the show (my #1 favorite show on TV; send me an e-mail and I'll wax poetic on why I love it so), it was a no-brainer that I'd buy the book via Audible and give it a listen.    In Heat Wave, Nikki Heat and her squad have Jameson Rook tagging along. Rook is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who is doing some background research on the NYPD and Nikki's squad drew the short straw. The rest of Heat's squad is Detectives Raley and Ochoa, mirroring Detectives Ryan and Esposito on the show. When Heat refers to or thinks of her partners together, she gives them the nickname \\"Roach.\\" Dang clever again. The one thing you don't have in the book (with Rook) is the father/daughter dynamic that is one of the most charming aspects of the television show. Rook's a bachelor, a \\"doable\\" bachelor as Heat's friend, Lauren, later tells her. And, just like Fillion says in the pre-credit sequence, Rook is \\"rougishly handsome.\\"    Like any good police procedural on television, the story starts right off with a death: a real estate tycoon who met death via the pavement under his sixth-floor window. For those of y'all in the back row, he was thrown out the window. In the pages that follow, Heat, Rook, and her squad investigate a myriad of clues, some unreleated, and we get a parade of suspects, colorful and ordinary.    The mystery wasn't earth-shattering although it did involve a few interesting turns. What drives the book and the television show is the chemistry of its two leads. In this case, Heat and Rook have their various tete-a-tetes in situations that are funny and irritating. The book is entirely from Nikki's POV so we get her internal thoughts on why her stomach flutters when Rook's near, the likelihood of her and Rook acutally getting together, and her utter exasperation when Rook doesn't listen to her orders and gets himself into one dire situation after another. It's a nice addition to the what we get on screen with little looks, eye rolls, and awkward moments. In a sort of reverse extrapolation, I now see TV's Beckett in a new light.    Middle way through the book, there's a scene of genuine tension. I don't want to give too much away but let me just paint the scene. Nikki's alone in her apartment, naked, having just taken a bath. An intruder's in her apartment. He's after her. What follows is a great scene, full of tension, action, and gumption. Very truthful, if you ask me, and I was roundly happy for how the writer ended the scene.    In a nod to what everyone wants to know about the TV show--will Castle and Beckett get together or won't they--Heat Wave answers the question for Nikki and Rook. And I'm not telling which way it went, either. You'll have to read the book to find out and make your own conclusion on what happened.    I've read on various websites (best one is CastleTV.net) that the novel is doing quite well, As of Tuesday (11/3), it's #23 on the Amazon bestseller list, #2 on Barnes & Noble's website, and #6 on the New York Times Bestseller list. That's got to be good news for the series and it's staying power. I can't help but think if it'll spawn another book. I'd read it in a heartbeat. [...]

0553381687|5.0|I am not a fan of fantasy.  I've read a little here and there, Tolkien, Turtledove, a few others.  Generally its just not my thing, preferring instead historical fiction, sci-fi, and horror.  I picked up a copy of George R. R. Martins' \\"A Game of Thrones\\" because I heard that HBO might adapt it for a series.  Being impressed with HBO series in the past, I thought I'd give the book a shot.<br /><br />I loved it.  \\"Thrones\\" has all the trademarks of great epic fiction: valiant heroes, diabolical villains, dangers, quests, battles, duplicity, revenge, complexity, adventure, sex, sacrifice, and betrayal.  This book reminds me of the best qualities of such outstanding pieces of fiction as Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\", John Jakes' \\"North & South\\" and Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  The 'fantasy' element of this work is slight, and the book reads almost more along the lines of historical fiction, as knights and lords battle for control of a kingdom.  The fantasy element is there, to be sure, but does not dominate the environment.  It is the story, not cheap devices like magic and sorcery, that are the stars of this book.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough.  It is a wild ride through an intricate and detailed world.  You will root for the Starks and damn the Lannisters, (well, most of them anyway)!  Most of all you will have a good time.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This show is one of the most underrated TV shows ever. Extremely well-written, great characters and character development, breathtaking setting and instantly relatable. People dismissed this show as a family, 7th Heaven-type show but it isn't. It tackles adult themes and social issues, tying it in to personal storylines. I'm also a huge fan of shows like Deadwood, The Wire, The Sopranos, Mad Men, In Treatment and The Office and I put this show up there with those shows in the writing department.

B000001EKX|4.0|The 2nd album from KISS, titled Hotter Than Hell, is not a bad album by any means, but, compared to their first, it's lacking a little. But I guess that's to be expected when you consider what a massive feat their debut album is. How can one top such a masterpiece? Well, KISS gave it a try and came up with some true gems here.<br /><br />The album's opener, Got To Choose, is okay, it's certainly catchy and keeps you humming along, but just you wait...Next is Parasite, which is a song almost too cool for words. I can remember hearing it for the first time way back in the seventies and playing it over and over again. The guitar riffs by the legendary Ace Frehley are stunning, and the whole song rocks hard from start to end. After this comes Goin' Blind which I have to admit has never been a favorite of mine, even though I always find myself singing along with it every time that I hear it. It just seems out of place on a KISS album, in my opinion.<br /><br />Coming next is the title track, Hotter Than Hell, and we are brought back to that awesome hard rockin' KISS sound. This is one of KISS' best songs ever featuring scorching guitar riffs and great vocals by Paul and the guys. Let Me Go Rock 'N' Roll is another nice and catchy rocking song that keeps you pumped throughout. Then comes the very great opening riff on the song All The Way, which also has some nice cowbell action in it as well. It's an all-around great song.<br /><br />And then another blazing opening riff accompanied by more cool cowbells comes at you in the great Watchin' You. As I said in my previous review of KISS's first album, Catman Peter Criss really knew how to spice up the drumming with a cowbell, and the next song, Mainline is no exception. Only this time, Criss also does the singing too. It's a nice rocker and keeps the album flowing nicely.<br /><br />Unfortunately KISS decided to add some filler at this point and we get the song titled Comin' Home, which is an okay song, I guess, but I never really could get into it all that much. Again, it just seems a little out of place here and really slows things down a little too much for my tastes.<br /><br />Which brings us to the last song on this disk,  Strange Ways, sung once again by Peter Criss. Criss does a great job singing here, but, the song is just not one of my favorites either for whatever reasons, even though it does feature some great guitar work by the rock guitar god Space Ace Frehley. All in all though, the album is pretty solid and has a few of what many consider to be some of KISS's best songs ever.that much.

0316010669|5.0|Headed to the library's checkout counter, I intuitively grabbed, \\"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking,\\" on display and added the hardcover book to the top of my pile.\\" I'm glad that I relied on my gut instead of my intellect.  Otherwise, I would have left the book behind, feeling that it would bore me with useless psychobabble.  This was far from the case.  I delved into the 250-plus pages chockfull of psychological studies and theories; the esoteric synthesis of information was just too good to put down.  After all, who gets eight hours of sleep these days anyway?<br /><br />As the title suggests, the book examines the unconscious brain processes, particularly concerning how the brain can make a snap judgment--in the blink of an eye.  Through exhaustive research, Malcolm Gladwell illustrates that people, to put it bluntly (but accurately), can be rather stupid some of the time.  In essence, many of his case studies prove that, yes, too much knowledge is not necessarily a good thing.  He shows that sometimes it is best to surrender the credentials and expertise, and operate under the rule of intuition.  On the other hand, he also substantiates, intuition, and things like first impressions, may not steer you on the correct path either.  So, go figure.  I suppose, as humans, we must accept our imperfections.<br /><br />Overall, however, the author's case studies, though plentiful, fall in an illogical, random order.  Obviously, Gladwell did not have a prior chronological skeleton before he filled the page marrow with prose. If the author had utilized an outline, he did not follow it.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the studies, whether portraying the petty, biased mind of a person or the plain no-nothingness of a person, are fascinating. Take, for instance, the notion of \\"sensation transference\\" which, Gladwell says, was coined by Louis Cheskin, a man born in Ukraine at the turn of the century and a U.S. immigrant child, who later became as Gladwell dubs \\"one of the greatest figures in twentieth-century marketing.\\"  Gladwell cites Cheskin's promotional effort of margarine, which back in the late 1940s, was the unpopular contender on the American table.  After Cheskin dyed margarine yellow, wrapped it in foil imprinted with a crown and the name, \\"Imperial Margarine,\\" consumers ended up raving.  Why?  Because a pretty package is just that.  Who needs to go below the surface?  Shallow, but true.  Stupidity always is.<br /><br />Gladwell also draws a picture of autism and cites an example of one of the country's leading experts on autism, a teacher at Yale University's Child Life Center, Ami Klin.  Klin tested the eye movement of an autistic adult while he watched the 1966 film version of Edward Albee's \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\"  When the scene involved two of the main characters kissing, the autistic man fixated on a light switch in the scene.  Klin sums up the premise as follows:  \\"....It's like if you were a Matisse connoisseur, and you look at a lot of pictures, and then you'd go, ahhh, there is the Matisse.  So he goes, there is the light switch.  He's seeking meaning, organization.  He doesn't like confusion.  All of us gravitate toward things that mean something to us, and for most of us, that's people.  But if people don't anchor meaning for you, then you seek something that does.\\"  Interesting stuff!<br /><br />Despite the book's lack of overall organization, \\"Blink:  The Power of Thinking without Thinking\\" packs a powerful punch from beginning to end without losing a blink of an eye's worth of force.ntieth-century marketing.\\"  Gladwell cites Cheskin's promotional effort of margarine, which back in the late 1940s, was the unpopular contender on the American table.

0385504225|3.0|Boring, not so many interesting facts to base this new novel on but instead it revolves around the same few ones over and over againg (they are just worded on different ways many times). And Robert Langdom is not longer the smart, clever and eager-to-solve-puzzles kind of hero he used to be, as a matter of fact he seems more concern on doubting himself than on providing answers letting others play his roll. Definetely a good read for the weekend if you do not expect D. Brown to top Angels and Demons or The DaVinci Code with this one. It will take the author more research and a more dynamic story line to come up with a better book.

How bitter was my disappointment when I opened the box to find the cover completely in Korean!  My son opened the packaging before I could stop him, and so I put it in the DVD player and hoped against all odds it would be in English.  I was sorely disappointed again.  Luckily the majority of the movie is music and no dialogue, but it is always a blow when you are expecting one thing and get another.  Just be warned this is not the English version, it is Korean.
B002MRROKS|4.0|Just finished watching the dvd in its entirety. All I have to say is, \\"Classic Show!\\" One of the cool things about watching/listening to a Nirvana show, is how all the songs seem like they're gonna fall apart at any moment. Or, how Kurt seems to wanna half-sabotage each and every song! You can even catch Dave and Krist laughing about it during some songs! I love seeing this side of the band. Especially since a lot of people have this preconceived idea that Nirvana were a bunch of overly serious, sad and depressed bunch of guys. Obviously not the case, as anyone can see in most of their live performances.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cd/dvd set to anyone who considers themselves a fan. And oh yeah, be sure to stay tuned until after the credits. There's a bit of a surprise.
B002QGSOU4|5.0|This is a great live set from the band that set the world a blaze in the early 90's.  The video quality is good, sound is great, and it does capture the energy of the day.  The only thing that was a bit of a let-down was the Amazon.com Exclusive packaging.  The Poster is good, but the box is not \\"tasteful hardbound slipcase\\", but a less than spectacular flat black cardboard, the thin dvd digipack style case, and then a thin cardboard spacer to keep the dvd from sliding around. The extra space is advertised \\"to put your other nirvana dvds in\\".  It is possible to do that, but the extra few dollars is not really worth it.  Also, the shipping (despite well packed with bubble wrap) had a dented corner on my box, and the low quality cardboard spacer is sprung out a bit because weight got placed on the shipping box.  Buy this DVD/CD set, well worth it, but save the money on the amazon exlusive version.
B002P6TA94|4.0|As much as I enjoyed the debut album from Wolfmother, this new album easily blows it away! It has song after song of awesome riff-filled rock. If you dig this band, make sure you get the 16 track version. The four extra songs are as good as anything else on the album. The only part I don't really get, is why they felt they had to split it across two separate discs?? When it could have easily fit onto one... Either way, this album is worth getting. Judging from the first two albums from this band, I have a feeling they will be around for quite some time!
0312360266|3.0|if you don't mind super-cheesy and pretty unrealistic dialogue (I'm around teens a lot and they never sound the way they do in the novel), this does have a kind of interesting take on vampires, blending with old pagan myths, and the Cherokee mythos in particular.  I've read all five novels, and I still feel that the authors don't have a clear understanding of what they're trying to do - their explanations are shallow and never become more fully developed, and after five books, I would expect that.    That said, this was easy to read and not terribly creepy.

0691142165|4.0|Reinhart and Rogoff's book provides a quantitative history of financial crises derived from over 600 years and 66 nations. The basic message from all their data is that there are remarkable similarities in today's financial crises with experience from other countries and nations. The common theme is that excessive debt accumulation by government, banks, corporations, or consumers often brings great risk. It makes government look like it is providing greater growth than it is, inflates housing and stock prices beyond sustainable levels, and makes banks seem more stable and profitable than they really are. Large-scale debt buildups make an economy vulnerable to crises of confidence - especially when the debt is short-term and needs to be refinanced (the usual case).<br /><br />Reinhart and Rogoff go on to conclude that most of these booms end badly. Outcomes include sovereign defaults (government fails to meet payments on its debt), banking crises (heavy investment losses, banking panics), exchange rate crises (Asia, Europe, Latin America in the 1990s), high inflation (a de facto default), and combinations of the preceding (1930s, today).<br /><br />What did the authors learn from their data digging? Severe financial crises share three characteristics: 1)Declines in real housing prices average 35%, stretched out over six years, while equity prices fall an average 56% over 3.5 years. 2)The unemployment rate rises an average of 7 percentage points during the down phase (average length = four years). Output falls more than 9% over a two-year period. 3)Government debt tends to explode, an average 86% in real terms. The biggest driver of this debt explosion is the collapse in tax revenues; counter-cyclical fiscal policy efforts also contribute, as well as spiking interest rates.<br /><br />Reinhart and Rogoff also identify what they find to be the best and worst (pronouncements from the Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury heads, and more than a few 'successful' academics and stock-pickers) early warning indicators of crises. Finally, the authors warn that premature self-congratulations on early successes in correcting a banking crisis may lead to complacency and an even worse state of affairs.<br /><br />The 'good news' is that Reinhart and Rogoff have provided a detailed and credible accounting of past experiences.  The 'bad news' is that despite the authors' scholarly and intense efforts, \\"This Time is Different\\" is not likely to sway many minds for two reasons. 1)The book is too much of a scholarly tome to become widely read, and there are too many self-serving 'think-tanks' offering contrarian opinions. Others, more data-driven, will point out that most of \\"This Time Is Different\\" is drawn from earlier days and non-U.S. nations, and thus of limited applicability to the U.S. today. 2)Despite recent disproof of claims that government has mastered the economic cycle via Federal Reserve fine-tuning and counter-cyclical government spending, and that 'the old rules of valuation no longer apply,' we're back blowing bubbles. Today's MSNBC headline reads 'New Market Bubble May be Brewing,' the 'Greenspan Put' (government will bail out falling markets, while allowing soaring ones) continues, no action has been taken to rein in Wall Street gambling and unwarranted bonuses, financial institutions believed 'too big to fail' are bigger than ever, and 2010 election pressures will undoubtedly auger for continued easy money, inflating ourselves out of debt, and increased debt at all levels.arning indicators of crises.

Between 'World War Z' and his 'Zombie Survival Guide' a zombie fan like myself is in flesh-eating heaven.  'Z' is a true masterpiece of the form though, and should be required reading for any horror/zombie fan.  The research into geography, history, weapons and language are first-rate in this novel.  Mr. Brooks has come up with so many new and terrifying scenarios that would undoubtedly play out in a zombie infestation that he leaves the reader feeling as if this were a work of non-fiction.  A perfect piece of literature (zombie or otherwise).

(I read this book of 374 pages in two and a half days, which is extremely fast for me.) Most of the book is not even set in the actual arena of the fighting. This book is more of the survival of Katniss and Peeta who are on the defensive and trying to stay alive. There is no cannibalism nor is it gory or brutal. I am very glad I did not pass this book up any longer.    I know there is a lot of talk of this book currently, which may be due to the second book recently being released. So with all this amazing praise I had to read it. Which was also a fear to me that with all the hype I would have higher expectations and the book would not measure up. Well, the book exceeded my expectations tremendously. Let me just say the praise is well deserved.    You meet Katniss here in the beginning right away. She sneaks past the fence around District 12 ment to \\"keep the animals of flesh eating out\\" and the citizens are not aloud to go outside the fence. Katniss has a spot she sneaks out and meets her friend Gale to hunt. See, they don't get caught or in trouble because the Peacekeepers of the city look the other way, as they like to eat meat too. Katniss has been trained at a young age by her father to hunt, and this is what Katniss has done to help keep her family alive after her father passes away in a mine accident years before.    Also, in the beginning you learn of the history of Panem, and how the Capitol has a gripping control over the 12 different Districts. As a lesson for trying to over throw the Capitol years past the Hunger Games came to exist. All the people are forced to have their children entered in the contest starting at age twelve through to eighteen, no matter stature or standing in the District. However, the poor children could very well have more entries than the richer. See, if the family is in need of food rations the child can enter an extra name in the drawing for this and you can do so for each person in your family. So with Katniss, she has a sister and a mother along with herself - this would be three more entries along with the one for this year. Oh yes, the entries are cumulative, so they carry over each year. That would get scary after a while.    On the day of the drawing all the people of the District are required to be there to witness this, and as a reminder. Katniss is shocked when her twelve year old sister who only has one entry gets picked as the girl to go to the games. What would you do for your sister? Would you sacrifice yourself to take her place? Well, that is just what Katniss does, volunteers to go in her spot.    I am surprised with the extent the Capitol goes to, to try and make this an exciting game to watch. The Capitol actually seem to enjoy this. The publicity the winners of the drawing get is unbelievable. There is lavish foods, complete make-overs, parades, and interviews. They are treated like royalty. People chant for these poor kids and bet on them. All this before they are sent to the arena to fight for their lives. The suspence is held through this section and there are peaks and valleys through here. My heart felt for Katniss and Peeta (the boy who won the drawing in District 12 with Katniss). Even the interview has a shocker to it. They need to win the love of the people in order to have sponsers to supply them \\"gifts\\" while they are in the arena when needed. The contenders all have to go through a training session for a few days then show their skills to the Gamemakers, which results in a scoring that could win them sponsers as well. All of these have their own peaks to them which keep youinterested and driving forward in the book.    Then you get to the Arena where the game begins. Now, you are going to have to read the book to see what happens here. Just remember the people of the Capitol like a show and will do anything to get it... There are a few twists that get added along with new rules as they go.    By the end of this book I loved Peeta and Katniss. My heart burst, swelled, and broke with them through all their tribulations. Will they both live? Will one die? Will they both die? I am ready to dive into the next book Catching Fire. This book has told a story and set up for the next book at the same time, very well written in that respect. I also feel I understand the characters very well.    I have to say, for a Young Adult book I would suggest it to any and all adults to read.

159102594X|4.0|The beginning of the book was easy yet a little hard for me. There is a lot of background work done here on the characters and the status of the world. You are introduced to all the characters in their elements, places, and world before they are introduced to each other. It can get a little confusing, but if you can keep it all separate it is worth it. One of the best parts here is having your characters separate and seeing their views on what they know or see, then seeing them actually meet and how the knowledge of that one character could help the other they just meet-if shared. Seeing how they get into the conversations to share the information or even when they don't share the information because they don't know who they have been in contact with or what they are involved in.    Through out the book you really get a feel of how unstable the three Empires are and the contempt they feel for each other. There are the Northmen, the Union and Angland, and the Gurkish. The Northmen and Gurkish seem to have leaders that are very ruthless and blood thirsty to take over as much land they can and rule all they take. The Union is stuck in the middle of both these places, yet doesn't seem to be as barbaric as the other two with killing. Angland is the place, in the North but is part of the Union, in which the Union sends all their guilty parties of treason agains the crown or toward the government (and in this time it could be a small thing or a large doing that could land you here - even working with or looking at the wrong person could hurt you). They have shared borders all these years?!? If you ask me I don't know how...    Just when you think you have all the characters details down a few more are added. All these people from the different areas of the world are pulled together to save their worlds from a bigger threat than the Northernmen or Glukish navy or Unions soldiers. What is this greater thing to be defeated by these specially selected few? That answer seems tobe only known by the First of the Magi, Bayaz, and his brothers.    There seems to be a magic that surrounds each character in their own way. Yet the characters don't seem to be aware to the fact they have something special about them. These characters don't even realize the enemies they make and the bigger enemies they upset. In this book the story only begins, the adventure only starts.    I am sorry to add here that you will have to read the next book to see where they go after this story. What about the war? Who is this greater threat? I too have to now go get the second book in this trilogy. I have questions and can not let them go unanswered. There is just too much scheming and bribing and underlying meanings in things said or not said that I just have to keep going with the trilogy. I hope you enjoy it as well.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|Slayer have once again shown why they are the best. This album is better than Christ Illusion. It's more focused, more aggressive, and more sinister.<br />It's all here: All-out speed, chugging/moshable grooves, insane guitar leads, Araya's timeless vocals (both gruff and spoken/softer), and the magnificent drum work of the inimitable Dave Lombardo. All of that is meshed together in such a razor-sharp manner, that you can't help but be blown away.<br /><br />As for the extra DVD...eh. Not such a big deal.<br /><br />If you've EVER liked Slayer, get this CD now. You will not be dissappointed.<br />Slayer is, without a doubt, the most consistent and reliable Metal band of their generation.
0439023491|5.0|This book starts just months after Katniss and Peeta return home from the Hunger Games, which they won by tricking the Capitol with those poisonous berries. Here we are in the morning of when the Victors Tour starts. Things have changed for Katniss in District 12. Katniss is not sure where she fits in now, she is rich beyond her dreams and has more fame than she wants with being a Victor, let alone the Love Struck Victor, of the Hunger Games. Then there is her relationships that have changed due to those Games; Gale, Peeta, her Mother, Prim, and the people (who helped her by donating what little they had to send her gifts along with all others). And Katniss is well aware she is hated by the Capitol Authorities for her trick that won her and Peeta the Hunger Games, when there is only to be one winner.<br /><br />President Snow graces Katniss with his presence before her tour and makes her aware some people believed what she did that won her the Hunger Games was inteded to save both Katniss's and Peeta's lives due to the crazy young love they shared, yet other Districts took this as an act of defiance towards the Capitol leading to possible uprisings. President Snow makes Katniss aware she is to do what she can to convince the people in all the Districts she is truely in love with Peeta and that is what drew her to come up with the idea with the berries, or else something will happen to anyone she loves (not nice either).<br /><br />Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, and the rest of their crew go on the tour. They are heavily guarded and watched as they go from District to District. Then you read of all the changes that happen in District 12 as we come to the next years Hunger Games. Even though this sounds as it may be boring, there are a lot of happenings that keep the pages turning and pick up small clues to what is going on around the different Districts and maybe even for later in the book.<br /><br />The next years Hunger Games come about with great celebration in the Capitol, being this is the anniversary of 75 years of games. Every 25 years the games are called the Quarter Quell, which are set up with special circumstances established by the Capitol when the games started. No one knows what these celebratory circumstances are until the sealed envelopes of years ago are opened and read. Katniss and Peeta are slightly relieved, as being Victors they are not entered in the drawings of the games again, yet they still worry over their siblings and friends who are in the age range. Or are they?<br /><br />Katniss gets tidbits of information as to what is going on outside District 12. But what is really going on? With District 12 being of such a small census will they be affected? Will Katniss be able to help sooth what people think of rebeling? Does she even want too? Where does Katniss stand on the rebellion and worries of her families and friends?<br /><br />You are going to have to read the book. There are very great details given along the way to help you out as well.<br /><br />The pacing is wonderful, everytime I went to set the book down to go back to work or go to bed (so I could get up for work) something else would happen and I had to keep going. The many rises and falls of the story are very well set to keep you going, no interest lost quickly here.

Dennis Wicks as Sciarrone looks like Arty Johnson. This is a long scene however it is not the complete story.  So as with the 1962 section this is the best of.<br /><br />The advantage to this recording is that there are no commercials it gets down to business.

0756405890|5.0|In this story you actually get two stories for one. There is a current time period and the story time period. In some books this blending is at times hard to keep separate. However, in this book it is very distinctly divided and there is no confusion as to what time period you are reading in.      The story starts off with an Inn Keeper, named Kote, tending his customers and maintaining his Inn. Kote is listening to all the talk at his inn for something... Some information as to how the world is doing, see there is a war currently being fought. Then a man named Chronicler comes in looking for Kvothe. Chronicler recognizes Kvothe as the Inn Keeper, and requests him to tell his life story so he can record it.      Kvothe comes up with some guidlines for the recording of his lifes history and Chronicler reluctantly agrees to them. As the story starts Kvothe takes you all the way back to when he was a happy, go lucky child with his family and troupe, and how he meet and was intreged by an Arcanist. Kvothe learned many things from this Arcanist, Ben, along with touching on Sympathy, or as we may call magic. Kvothe was very interested in the sympathy and after watching Ben call upon the wind Kvothe wanted to learn the name of the Wind in the worst way possible. With the many things Ben taught Kvothe, Ben learned that Kvothe was an exceptionally brilliant child. Ben told Kvothe and his parents of the University, the place for learning all there is to learn to be a guilded Arcanist.      Kvothe is not sure if he wants to leave the life style he currently has to go to the University, though it does sound wonderful to him. However, as you know in books there is sometimes not a choice, life leads the way for you. There are many unfortunate things that happen to Kvothe here as he is growing up and he losses his way for a few years. But, when Kvothe comes out of the state of shock he had been in for three years he makes the decision to go to the University. Kvothe is one of theyoungest and poorest kids to sit for the admissions of the University. Kvothe is accepted in with a tuition he needs to figure out how to pay.      Kvothe has many trials and tribulations he needs to over come and surpass to keep going throughout the book. You are probably asking, what sets this book apart from others or makes it special. Aside from the troubles Kvothe gets into and the unique resolutions, the writing style holds you attention. You are left wondering what analogy Patrick is going to use next. Or what discriptive words he will rhythmically link together to make the perfect visual, sound, touch or taste. The descriptions of all the senses are so detailed you can visualize with ease what is being told. The story itself has a rise and fall like poems or music do. There is a flow to the way of the story that you just follow along very smoothly.      You get to hear what happens from Kvothe then you get to hear the stories that are spread and told by the other students and towns people. It is funny to hear the legendary stories and compare them to what really happened, amazing how a story can get changed around depending on what people thought they saw then mix in their believes.      Do I recommend this book? Whole heartedly! You may think the story is just the simple story of another poor boy, but I have to say this story is anything but simple. The uniqueness of the problem solving used, along with the descriptive writing should be shared with all.

B000002JSJ|4.0|Led Zeppelin's Presence (1976) is an often overlooked gem of an album with seven songs that vary a lot from each other, but all of them rock.  This album was recorded while singer Robert Plant was recovering from injuries he sustained in a 1975 car accident.<br /><br />The album begins with my all time favorite Zep song ever, Achilles Last Stand.  This song is fast, furious, heavy, and hard hitting.  Great drumming, guitar and vocals.  Plant uses his voice as a sort of instrument in the middle of the song.  A ten minute-plus classic.  The next song is a change of pace, the slow rocking For Your Life.  The next song, Royal Orleans, features a great guitar riff by Jimmy Page.  The classic Nobody's Fault But Mine features, in my opinion, some of Page's best guitar playing ever.  Plant once again uses his voice as a sort of instrument, which is one of his trademarks.  The band throws listeners a changeup with Candy Store Rock, a popish Elvis-type song.  Speaking of popish, the next song falls into this category, Hots On For Nowhere.  Plant provides another great performance on vocals.  This song is very upbeat, as are Plant's vocals.  The album closer, Tea For One, is a slower song that kind of sets a low key mood with its lower volume level.  Good bass playing by John Paul Jones.<br /><br />If you're only familiar with the usual classic Led Zeppelin songs you hear over and over on the radio and want to listen to some of Zeppelin's more obscure (and great) songs, then buy this album.  I think you'll like it.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Ah, what can I say?  Michael Jackson is no longer Peter Pan or pretending to be.  A great behind the scenes look at a mature, sexy come-into-his-mature-own musical genius weaving his magic.  For the fans who have only seen him perform in person or on video, or doing an interview he really didn't want to do, or appearing at an award show to mumble a few words, they (we) finally get to see Michael in his element, behind the scenes, doing his thing for his fans.    Ever humble, polite, and loving, Michael is truly in command. You don't want to displease Michael, you just want to achieve the very best and work as hard as he does as a performer.  To paraphrase Tommy Organ (guitarist), there is some serious genius stuff going on around here.  And indeed Michael knows his stuff - every lyric, every note, every rhythm, every cue, and every beat.  As he tells his keyboardist (Michael Bearden) when asked what does he want to hear, \\"I want to hear it the way I wrote it.  I want the audience to hear it the way they hear it\\" (ouch). In his own words, Michael \\"sizzles\\" and \\"simmers\\" and shows young, muscular dancers half his age how its *really* done.     Saving his voice and body for the upcoming 50 concerts, Michael still can't help but give his all.  At one point he exhorts his audience that they shouldn't do that to him (encouraging him to sing to his fullest - during a soulful rendition of \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\") because he's saving his voice, a voice (Michael Bearden's) screen says, \\"But Mike you were feeling it.  You can allow yourself this one time.\\" \\"No, no\\", he says, \\"I can't [I have to save my voice].\\"  Michael's vocalizations during \\"Human Nature\\" will send chills down your spine.      Michael improvises a new version of \\"Billie Jean\\", at one point going into a slo-mo crouch grabbing hump with a \\"nasty\\" face that says this \\"old\\" man still has sex appeal and then some.  The young macho dancers go wild and he brings tears (and not a just little lust) to this fan's eyes.      See it more than once.  See it the first time and you can't take your eyes off Michael, and then see it the second time for all the things you missed because you were mesmerized. Then see it a third time to put it all together.      Michael still has the vocal chops and the dancing chops.  He is on point with a super-preternatural ability to hear, feel, and see in the music and the rhythm what no mere mortal can. Michael was doing this for us, the fans, and the show was going to be the biggest, the best, and the most spectacular performance the world as ever seen. Kenny Ortega treats the material and Michael with both intimate knowledge and respect.      Warning, stay until the very last credit rolls as there is a little surprise at the end and a tribute that will bring fresh tears to your eyes.  You'll find yourself smiling throughout though because Michael is having just too much fun.
B00027JYLC|4.0|This was a great movie. It has a busy story line and multiple characters. One thing you will need to do is turn the volume on your tv up. The sound is very quiet at some parts compared to newer movies. Excellent if you appreciate older movies and old fashioned beauty.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|This is just why I was expecting from the new Slayer CD, fast, straight forward songs, guitar solo duels within JH and KK, catchy guitar riffs. Lyrics as usual, no love songs here (I really don't care about the lyrics, neither take them seriously).    I can here the CD from beginning to end without skipping any sound as I do with Hell Awaits, Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss and Christ Illusion. Never got the same feeling hearing Divine Intervention, Diabolus and God hate us All. And definitely, this CD is far from Show no Mercy, Haunting the chapel and Undisputed Attitude sound.    Don't really understand people complaining about the CD sounding the same as before and pointing Slayer is making money about the same old formula, or the other side complaining about the sound is different than before, then, they sold out. In my opinion World Painted Blood shine by itself. Take it or leave it.    The DVD is really a disgrace. Don't see the point to include that piece of rubbish in the package.    Slayer has released again a solid CD.

B002OEBMN4|5.0|SLAYER has returned with a MONSTER of an album!  Not that they ever went away, but \\"World Painted Blood\\" can take it's unholy place next to \\"Reign in Blood\\", \\"South of Heaven\\" & \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\". The originators of Extreme Metal have returned to claim their Blood Drenched Throne.  Those people that say they have been in a rut the last few years, just need to listen to this album once--twice--who am I kidding, just leave it in your cd player. Not only have they ditched pro-tools for Dave, but Dave is once again showing why he is the First, the Last & ONLY NAME IN EXTREME THRASH! His drums are thumping & to help with the bone crushing riffs he scaled back to a 9 piece. Tom is back in classic form that was very apparent on \\"South of Heaven\\" & \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\", Kerry is well Kerry (we don't our unholy bald brother to change now do we?) Jeff has returned & what a return--SLAYER is 20 times better when Jeff is heavily involved.  This is what the follow up to \\"Seasons\\" should have been. Once again they show the immitators how the big boys do it.   Do yourself a favor & buy this album right now, in fact don't stop with this album, go on a demonic journey until you see yourself throw your horns in the air & scream SLAYER till you lungs bleed.

B00008BLB8|5.0|Climax Blues Band and Wet Willie opened for GFR. The set list was identical to this one...it was the Shinin' On tour. Farner had a metallic-finished guitar that would blind you when he caught it in the spotlight and sent a beam shooting through the weed smoke that hung like a London fog in the Cow Palace. And he kept doing it throughout the entire show. You'd see him turn and turn your head or pay the consequences.    :-)    Whether you are a Grand Funk fan or not, this band worked hard and gave their fans full value for every ticket dollar. The set list is an excellent snapshot of the band in its post-\\"American Band,\\" \\"Locomotion\\" period of fame, including \\"The Railroad,\\" from the \\"We're An American Band\\" album, one of their strongest non-single tracks of all time.    This isn't a CD that you cherry-pick for a good song here, a good song there. You pop this one in and press \\"play\\" and enjoy the entire ride.    I still laugh out loud when Don Brewer bellows \\"ARE YOU WITH ME\\" during his solo in \\"T.N.U.C.\\" He was something to see...that huge 'fro, arms and legs shooting out in all different directions...    Buy it, and enjoy.

Now basically if you are expecting this book to teach you English language and grammar completely, you are mistaken, this is just a guide on how to excel on the test, a perfect one i must say, your general performance on a language is based on lifetime practice; constant reading, writing and speaking the language, but regarding the test, this is a blueprint on how to pass the TOEFL IBT.

055380684X|4.0|Daniel Coyle's book is well researched. He has spent a good deal of time at these \\"Talent\\" hotbeds and dug for the keys to prodigies. Like other books before his, he has bad news for those who believe its \\"nature\\" and not \\"nurture.\\" Because it's all about hard work.     1. Deep Practice - there is an unfamiliar rhythm or method to practice that makes a \\"genius\\"    2. Ignition - This is where the book gets a little vague, I thought.  Vague because this is about motivation and keeping after the deep practice after a person had started to pursue their skill set or chosen field.  However, there wasn't much insight into how they kept their motivation.    3. Master Coaching - This is probably the key to pushing through a skill set and keeping Ignition.  But more importantly this form of coaching is highly important to the overall mastery and ascent to greatness.  This is where the talent hotbeds come into play and the master coaches who run them.  This subject is covered very well in The Talent Code.  Anyone who is interested in this area of development will find the information here useful.    Throughout the book Coyle writes about the myelination process and how it is the key to greatness in any field.  The neuroscience have shown us the the answer to becoming great at what we choose to work hard at.    I recommend this book as a quick read and it is indexed and referenced well for any further digging you may want to do on this topic.
0739309560|5.0|From the very beginning, I was hooked on this story.  I played the CD's in the car while making trips around town and a longer one to a nearby city.  I hated to get out of the car and often had to sit and listen a while in my car to get to a point where I could turn it off.  I was especially interested in the whole Masonic thread that ran through the story because my late husband was a Mason.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves suspense and clever presentation of the plot.  The ending really surprised me and I liked that.  Keep them coming, Dan Brown.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|Slayer is very, very rare...like a fine wine, they seem to get better with age. Still the same speed and hardcoreness..unlike the others, who  have completely sold out in order to sell more records..i.e. Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth..
B0029XZODY|5.0|We have not signed up for Showtime because the only show we would watch is Dexter. However, since we just finished watching season 3, and not sure if we can wait a whole year for Season 4 to come out on DVD we might just have to break down and sign up. What a great show, how can you possibly like and root for a serial killer?? Well, with Dexter you can. Very clever show.
B001SAHOBO|5.0|Donnie Yen is one of the greatest Hong Kong martial actors to hit the scenes, as evidenced by his recent appearance in Hero. Now, as the star of his own film, his ability and talent comes under the spotlight in a vaguely-historical film on China under the oppression of the Japanese. A must see for any kung-fu-movie fan or even anyone looking for a great no-wires-needed action film.

B002IKLZZY|5.0|Wow! The Blu-ray is the transfer we've been waiting for. It eclipses all previous ones (at least, those I've seen), including the well-done LV.<br /><br />\\"NbNW\\" has never been a particularly \\"good-looking\\" film. Projection prints were grainy and contrasty, with vivid, vulgar colors. This transfer -- made from the camera negatives, or something close -- corrects these problems.<br /><br />For the first time, we can see just how /beautiful/ \\"NbNW\\" is, and the outstanding quality of the cinematography. The scene in which Mason closes the drapes and turns on the lights, while he and Grant eye each other and waltz around the room, has a sense of depth and \\"tonality\\" I've ever seen before. Even better is the scene on the train where Grant and Saint engage in \\"intercourse\\" while clothed and standing up (Hitchcock knew how to get around the censors! *). It's soft and romantic, a quality quite lost in previous transfers.<br /><br />Interestingly, the matte paintings, rear projection, and static mattes are /less/ obvious than they were in previous versions. The scene in which Thornhill and the Professor walk toward the plane is perhaps the finest example of rear projection you'll ever see. You have to look closely to realize they're /not/ at an airport. **<br /><br />\\"NbNW\\" was shot in VistaVision (\\"Motion-Picture High Fidelty\\"). It uses what still photographers would call a full 35mm frame (rather than the half frame used for movies), and therefore runs horizontally through the camera. Of all 35mm formats, VistaVision was /made/ for high-definition video. Its basic aspect ratio is 5:3 (within the 3:2 film frame), and it can be matted to wider aspect ratios in the camera or during projection. ***<br /><br />\\"NbNW\\" was probably intended to be projected at 1.85:1. This transfer is at the slightly less-wide 16:9 (1.77:1), an excellent choice that fills the HD screen. Nothing is lost, and there are no distracting borders (for those bothered by such things).<br /><br />And let's not forget the sound, because this is a Bernard Herrmann score. As far as I know, this is the first transfer to present all the music in stereo (ditto for sound effects). (The LV had only the overture in stereo.) The sound is fantastically good -- if you're so young you think \\"digital good, analog not-so-good\\", you need to hear this. ****<br /><br />I have some gripes. Several shots in the crop-duster sequence have a \\"splotch\\" near the center, likely due to a water droplet that dried on the lens. And the brightness of some of the static mattes in the Mount Rushmore sequence flickers quite obviously. These would not have required a lot of work to correct.<br /><br />Another reviewer has criticized the color, and I'm inclined to agree. Male skin tones are excessively warm, even yellowish. This is fine for Cary Grant -- who sported a perpetual Douglas Fairbanks tan -- but most of the male actors look as if they've spent too much time under a sun lamp. Now, get this... excerpts from this transfer used in the supplemental material have more-natural skin tones! Why this is, I don't know, but I've seen it on several recent Blu-rays -- the image quality in the supplements is better than that of the film itself.<br /><br />As is becoming increasingly common for \\"important\\" movies, the disk is encased in a souvenir book. It's nice, but substance-free. You'll read it once, then put it aside. (It's a shame such books don't attempt to duplicate the contents of road-show souvenir booklets, but the format doesn't lend itself to it.)<br /><br />As for the film itself, what is there to say? A classic, a perfect example of how Hitch was able to \\"play\\" the audience like an organ. In my \\"Snow White\\" review, I suggest that it is possibly the most consciously ingenuous film ever made. Hitchcock's films are the polar opposite -- consciously disingenuous. He's not just telling a story, but deliberately manipulating the audience. The audience knows it, but loves it anyhow.<br /><br />Perhaps the most-amazing thing about \\"NbNW\\" is the way Hitchcock seamlessly melds humor, suspense, and action. (Grant's ability to switch instantly between restrained-ironic and dead-serious helps.) Only Steven Spielberg has come close. But he'll never be a Hitchcock.<br /><br />* Thematically, \\"NbNW\\" is much like \\"Notorious\\" -- Ingrid Bergman is a \\"loose\\" woman coerced into marrying Claude Rains so she can spy on him for the government. In a famous scene, Hitchcock got around the Code's restriction on how long a man and woman can kiss by repeatedly having Grant and Bergman break the kiss, then start over -- which makes the scene even more sensual.<br /><br />** MGM probably realized that VistaVision would reveal problems not visible in a smaller format, and spent the money for better effects shots.<br /><br />*** Given the high cost of VistaVision prints and the need for a special projector, few theaters were able to project VistaVision as it was meant to be seen. Most VistaVision prints are half-frame reductions, which lose most of the original quality.<br /><br />**** I used to do live recording, and digital comes closer to live sound. But... in the late 50s and early 60s, analog tape recording had reached a level of transparency, \\"immediacy\\", realism, and just plain \\"euphony\\" you rarely hear today. Simply in terms of \\"sounding good\\", this 50-year-old soundtrack is state-of-the-art. (If you want to hear a modern recording that's better -- that is, coming significantly closer to live sound -- try the Rilling performance of Britten's \\"War Requien\\".)s the most-amazing thing about \\"NbNW\\" is the way Hitchcock seamlessly melds humor, suspense, and action.

B00004RFFI|3.0|An Ok Movie to kill a couple of Hours. Not a Masterpiece, but for a disaster movie....
B002NOAF9W|4.0|As a long time Rolling Stones fan, I am delighted that Abkco has re-released Ya Yas as a 40th anniversary box set. The 1969 tour brought the return of the Rolling Stones to America after a three year absence. This was Mick Jagger's break-out tour and one that would solidify the Stones reputation as the \\"greatest rock and roll band in the world.\\" With their new guitarist (and replacement for Brian Jones in tow), the Stones rocked and socked halls all over America playing their new classics like Midnight Rambler & Sympathy for the Devil to very satisfied customers.    Ya Yas is a snapshot in time of the Stones performing over two nights at Madison Square Garden in November 1969. What you hear on this recording (and see on the DVD disc) are the Stones at the peak of their collective powers- both on a musical and performance level. It is no surprise that many critics over the years have included Get Yer Ya Yas Out on their lists of the best live rock albums of all time.    Sooooo...as a long time fan like me, you've bought and worn out the original album, you've purchased the CD, and later bought the re-master from 2002...You ask yourself- is it worth shelling out even more money for this pricey box set??? The answer is: ABSOLUTELY! In addition to the original 10 songs as featured on disc 1, included is a bonus disc of great tunes such as the acoustic Prodigal Son, the medley of Under My Thumb-I'm free and a blistering version of Satisfaction that were left off the original disc. The third disc features great music by the opening acts B.B. King and Tina Turner. The Stones originally conceived of Ya Yas as a two album set with the opening acts represented, but this idea was subsequently scrapped. Finally, you get a 4th DVD disc of some (not a lot) great concert footage (be forewarned that some of this is duplicated material featured on the Criterion Gimme Shelter DVD), along with backstage access to round out the box set (along with a nice hardcover booklet featuring Ethan Russell photographs from the 69 tour). Sound quality overall is excellent.    The only real criticisms that I can make regarding this box set is that it could have been offered at a more affordable price by eliminating the second disc altogether and putting the five bonus tracks at the end of disc one. Also, adding more concert footage and including a COMPLETE performace from Madison Square Garden on the DVD disc would have elevated this release to stellar status.  However, those points aside, if you are a hard core Stones fan like me (and appreciate the music produced during the Mick Taylor years), overall, this box set is a must have.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|We bought this for my Dad for Christmas. It makes a great gift, we will also get him a new cd holder.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Just an amazing collection of music - right from the start, the 1st songs opening riff pulls you in and you become transfixed on how the drawn out vocals fit perfectly into the rapidly moving guitar play - you immediately know that more good stuff is yet to come.  Jerry Cantrell proves once again that he is an amazing song writer and one of the most talented alternative rock musicians ever to grace the scene.  His tribute to his friend and former band mate Layne Staley (R.I.P) is portrayed beautifully in the song \\"Black gives way to blue\\".  Singer/guitarist William DuVall does an admirable job harmonizing the vocals with Jerry throughout the album.  Sean Kinney's drum as always are spot on and so creative in sound.  In my opinion the album combines the feel of the Dirt album with Jerry's solo album Degradation Trip.  As a 90's alt rock fan, this is the best album I have heard in the last few years other than Tool's 10,000 days.  Note:  Best listened to very loud!!!

0312380852|5.0|I had seen micro-macrame projects on the Internet and had wanted to try this technique.  I then purchased this book and am currently working on my first project.  Although the projects are progressive, in that they start off fairly easy and increase in difficulty, I was able to go to the back of the book and start with one of the more involved projects with ease.  This was possible due to the great photos and step by step process on how to tie specific knots to produce really up to date and colorful jewelry.  The thing that I like the most about this book is that the projects are modern and the use of the author's color palett gives great ideas for much success.  This book worked for me!!
B00284BNKC|5.0|Despite of the raw content of the movie, I give this movie 5 stars because the director of the film is able to show the underground world where people may be left while consuming any kind of drugs. It is dramatic, powerful, sad and shocking.   Furthermore, blu-ray movies are the only way to watch movies at home. Therefore, Requiem for a Dream is a highly recommended movie and its quality just awesome.

This novel takes us out of the urban and into the woods, with the usual twists and turns, as well as 'will she, won't she'. While you can get the unusual characters like the Easter Bunny, somehow you find that they become believable.Then there's Elmer the F--ter, who Grandma just loves.The humour may be grim at times, but it's still there.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|I found that this movie was the best to date and the story line was well adapted. Harry and friends are well up to the task of doing what they do. Will everyone quit griping about how much is left in or out of any HP movie, The only thing that I see as a problem is that the horcruxes were not really mentioned and it is assumed that everyone knows what they are. I have read book 7 numerous times so I know what they are and it is facinating to me to see Harry and the gang just pass them by everywhere they go. This is what makes the moview so great. We all know what happens so lets just revel in that fact and move on to number 7 and 8. Lets also keep Mr Yates directing the last 2 OK.I also liked the comedic effect in the Half Blood Prince too. It does not always have to be about Voldemort and what he will do next. Comedy in this film was superb. Thanks for all 6 movies guy2!!!!!

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I was looking for a set of headphones for late night PS3 gaming (to avoid disturbing my family). Sound quality was my first priority followed by comfort and ease of use. I do not engage in online gaming, so the Chat feature was not a consideration (and, since the X41s are designed primarily for the X360, Chat is not supported for the PS3). I purchased these (X41s) and a set of Triton AX Pro headphones. I found the sound quality of both headphones to be very good, but the overall \\"presence\\" and clarity of the X41s is superior. Sound directionality of the X41s is also superb - I can easily discern sound coming from from the side, behind and even above. Contrary to some other reviewers, I could detect no hiss.    The X41s are relatively lighweight and comfortable for long gaming sessions. The Tritons were quite heavy and began to strain my neck after about an hour.    The wireless feature of the X41s is definitely a plus - I experienced no popping or drop-outs as long as I remained in the same room with the base. Compared to the Tritons, it was wonderful to be untethered from the PS3. (Great for Guitar Hero - no cords in the way!)    Conclusion: With their superior sound quality and directionality, level of comfort and wireless connectivity, the Ear Force X41 headphones are the best setup you can get for the PS3! - IF you can live without the online Chat function. (The Tritons were returned.)    12/31/10 Update: I recently purchased an Astro A40 Headset (with the MixAmp) because I have seen several very positive reviews on this equipment. As such, I performed a head-to-head comparison with my X41s. I must begin by saying the build quality and packaging of the A40s is absolutely first rate! The A40s are very well built, sturdy and stylish. The headset uses 2x40mm speakers (as opposed to 2x50mm on the X41) and has a freq response of 15-28000Hz (as opposed to 20-20000Hz for the X41). The Mixamp supports Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound and allows for connectivity with chat to just about any gaming platform - XBOX, PS3, PC, etc. Judging by the build quality and some of the specs alone, one would think that the A40s would easily surpass the X41s in performance. However, after a direct sound quality comparison, I believe the X41s provide a better overall experience in gaming applications. The A40s seemed slightly muffled - the X41s had better high-end performance (I could easly hear my character's spurs jingling when I walked in \\"Call of Juarez - Bound In Blood\\" and had difficulty with the A40s). Other ambient sounds just seemed to be better defined with the X41s. Low end sounds such as explosions were pretty close between the two headsets, but I have to give the edge to the X41s because of their \\"Bass Boost\\" feature. The bottom line is that, while I really wanted to love the A40s, the overall sound quality (to my ears) of the X41s is superior. That said, the A40s are more versatile (better connectivity) and will not disappoint. In the end, sound quality is subjective, but I prefer the X41s - and no cords is plus!

B002OFWG7E|4.0|Almost fifteen years ago Nirvana drummer, Dave Grohl, started a project called Foo Fighters.  On the debut self-titled album, Grohl played all of the parts.  Later hiring a full band, he gave the world what it now knows as the Foo Fighters.  Despite a few member changes over the years, Foo Fighters have managed to produce some of the best albums of the 90s and the new millennium.  Their most recent release is a career-spanning greatest hits collection aptly titled Foo Fighters Greatest Hits.    Since 1995, Foo Fighters have produced some of the most recognizable rock songs in both of their respected decades.  1997's \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" brought us hits like \\"Everlong\\" and \\"Monkey Wrench\\", and 2005's \\"In Your Honor\\" brought us the mega-hit \\"Best of You\\".

B002M2T1UO|3.0|I have only seen season 1 of this REALLY GREAT show, and I decided to buy The Shield: Complete Series in a 'coffee table' style book because for only $109.99 it seemed like it was a great deal. Well, it was anything but a great deal, and from this I have learned a lesson to never buy a 'coffee table' style book dvd set ever again no matter how beautiful the 'coffee table' book is. The 'coffee table' book is really beautiful in this The Shield: Complete Series set as it has alot of nice pics and notes, but every disc in this set was horribly scratched. And I mean every single disc was really badly scratched. It was a good thing that the store where I bought it from allowed me to return it for a refund, because usually a retail store will only allow an exchange for the same item. So now I have to decide on how much I really like this show to buy each season set separately, because that is not cheap as that will cost more than twice as much as the Complete Series set by itself. Oh well, it was a lesson learned.

1416594884|2.0|I have to admit I haven't read any Le Carr&eacute; in years -- and after this book, I doubt I will for years to come. In simple terms, it's the story of a half-Chechen illegal immigrant in Hamburg who is trying to lay claim on the considerable loot his dead father (a Russian military officer) salted away in a private bank. He manages to find legal aid in the form of a humorless, well-connected female lawyer, who acts as his intermediary in discussions with the 60ish English banker who controls this \\"dirty\\" account. At the same time, it tells a parallel story of competing German intelligence agencies seeking the Chechen as a possible terrorist, and the eventual involvement of British and American espionage agencies.<br /><br />Actually, that description probably makes the book sound better than it is. The big flaw is that several of the key characters, especially the lawyer and the Chechen claimant, are both thinly drawn and really annoying. For the majority of the book, the Chechen is erratic and enigmatic, and I kept waiting for Le Carr&eacute; to do a big reveal and let us in on what his true nature is -- alas, this never happens. That's kind of the problem with the whole book -- it builds very very slowly, almost teasing the reader with its deliberate pace and shadowy corners, only to climax in an incredibly weak ending.<br /><br />Which is not to say the book is totally without bright spots. The banker character is reasonably sympathetic and compelling, as is the main German intelligence agent (both are assisted by coolly able women, who are fun supporting cast members in their own right). And despite the  thinness of many characters, Le Carr&eacute; still manages to do a nice job getting at the psychology of the post-9/11 intelligence community. One insight that's particularly striking is how quickly our principles can be dismantled by cynical and efficient state security apparatus. And the workings of that apparatus are fairly interesting to observe, in a procedural way. Unfortunately, since we never care about the characters, it's not that dramatically compelling when they are levered away from their principles.<br /><br />The book's other major flaw -- the ending -- is difficult to discuss in a way that won't spoil the book. Some have complained about the abruptness of it -- but for me the jarring lack of narrative closure it imposes is actually a canny choice. The real problem is that while it's an ending that is true to the reality of some of the worst excesses (crimes even) perpetrated under the guise of national security in the post 9/11 era, it's also a gratuitous and unsophisticated one. You could argue that the contrast in tone between the body of the book and the ending is a deliberate one, but it all feels more rushed than anything else.e never care about the characters, it's not that dramatically compelling when they are levered away from their principles.

B001QXE0OC|4.0|What can I say? Selena Gomez is amazing, and is a great role model. I think this album could have been better, but there is a batch of songs on this album that are very catchy, she does it well. Her voice isn't as powerful as her best friend, Demi, but Selena still shines well. Demi, and Selena's music is different from each others. I think they should do an album together. I can't wait for both of them to put out a new album, maybe next year? I sure hope so. I think you should at least check out this album, this album isn't terrible, but I would have left a few songs of this album, not saying which ones, because I have respect, for the ones who like the songs on this album that I don't. The stand out songs on this album are:<br />1. Falling Down<br />2. The Way I Loved You<br />3. Tell Me Something I Don't Know<br />I know I give this album four stars, but there is a lot of songs I can listen to over, and over again, and not get tired of them, but this is still one of my favorite albums of 2009, Just because I give this album four stars doesn't mean that this album isn't one of my favorite albums of the year. I think Selena is a great person, you should at least give her a chance.
0596522347|4.0|When you boil any form of communication down -- a conversation, an article, a book, a presentation -- it's really just a story. This is one of the guiding premises of Nancy Duarte's book, slide:ology.  Interestingly, the story that she tells in this book is about how to tell a better story orally and visually. Because of the challenges of writing about a presentation instead of giving one, this book reaches beyond the realms of traditional books. The striking full-color volume is packed full of diagrams, examples, and case studies, as well as more traditional descriptions of what to do and why.  The book is also accompanied by a helpful website and a free 45 day access to the online edition of slide:ology through Safari Books Online.  The book itself is part speech coach, part visual design instructor, and all inspirational. The bulk of it deals, unsurprisingly, with designing slides: layout, templates, color and diagram choices, etc. Each chapter deals first with the theory, explaining why color choices matter and how the audience perceives what is being presented. The overriding theme is clarity and simplicity, which is emphasized through the design of each page, with plenty of white space (\\"visual breathing room\\") and examples. Most chapters include at least one case study, describing successful presenters who have used the techniques outlined (often clients of Duarte Design), and most case studies include online links where the reader can actually watch the presentation being presented instead of described, or download PowerPoint templates, allowing the reader to use the techniques themselves.  slide:ology was both an informative and enjoyable read. Duarte has a way of being encouraging and inspiring, even while pointing out errors that are made countless times. Especially geared toward professionals who are giving presentations regularly, this book is worth a look by anyone who might be watching or giving a presentation in the future. The biggest downside: you'll never be able to sit through a traditional PowerPoint presentation again!<br />For a full Review go to: Interface, Berglund Center for Internet Studiesll never be able to sit through a traditional PowerPoint presentation again!

1401323820|3.0|I tremendously enjoy the TV show \\"Castle\\", from which this book is derived, and find myself very disappointed that the book does not measure up, in quality, humor or skillful writing, to its parent.  Not to say it's bad, but someone who was expecting the same sense of fun that the show projects (amid serious subject matter), well, it doesn't even come close.         Compared to authors (eg, Robert B. Parker) who can skillfully convey a humorous putdown with a brief phrase, the dialogues in many parts of this book are clunky, at best, cringeworthy at worst.  In the TV series, the writer is a human being, imperfect but likable; in the book, he's a cardboard cutout, a walking cliche.  The book reads as if written by a committee.  Maybe one of these days I'll force myself to read beyond the obligatory (page 105) sex scene.

Indeed, if a guitar can no longer be considered 'true vintage' if the tuners have been replaced, then how can it be considered vintage if the original strings and tags aren't on anymore? Hilarious.  How about sustain? You can go and have a bite, and come back and it'll still be going 'aaaahhhh'...    Again, if you're a musician, every line rings true and is funny.

0061537969|5.0|This book had me enthralled from the beginning.  I love the inventive way that Stein used the dog, Enzo, to convey his story.

B001AVCFJM|3.0|I can certainly understand how non-Star Trek fans could give this movie such a high star rating. It is, in fact very entertaining and visually stimulating. However, from a Star Trek fan prospective, it is a major blow to the Star Trek world. I now understand the movie's tag line; \\"This is your father's Star Trek.\\" Yeah, no kidding, because it's been completely redone.    The short end - From a visual prospective, this Star Trek installment was GREAT! It had all the effects and looks that the rest of the movies couldn't or didn't do, thanks to advancements in movie making, obviously. For that part, visually speaking, I would give it a 4 1/5    The downside is the fact that JJ Abrams has taken a series of 40+ years and rewritten it! It is so rewritten that it could be compared to rewriting Star Wars and having Darth Vardar tell Luke, \\"Luke, I'm not your father. Hans Solo is.\\" Of course, JJ would NEVER to that to the Star Wars ethos, since he is a Star Was fanboy, not to mention Lucas would castrate him.     The Spoke/Uhura relationship, what was that? Scotty not being the guy that had a major hand in building the Enterprise, instead he's working some second rate gig, etc, etc. For that, I would give the movie a ½ to 1.    The biggest misfire, I think, was the premise of a pissed off Romulin, who has all the power in the world to alter time, wanting more to revenge upon and kill Spoke, who tried to save the planet, instead of just altering time and saving his entire world. Hmmm. weak, at best. 1 1/2.     I've never understood writers and directors who come up with such weak stories and premises, that the viewer is asking the question \\"why didn't he just do X,\\" within 5 mins of witnessing the event. Star Trek is one of those movies. But, the movie still carries on in an entertaining way, so I can't complain too much.    Overall, I think the movie is good. I just don't think, from a Star Trek prospective, it's great. To completely redo a beloved series/world, is a majorblow.

1595141715|3.0|In his first novel \\"Thirteen Reasons Why,\\" Jay Asher explores the idea that every individual's actions always affect someone else. While this theme is apparent throughout the entire novel, there are several issues that a teacher should consider before presenting to a group of high school students. First of all, several of the novel's characters demonstrate more adult-like responses than would be realistically expected from adolescents. Clay is a prime example of this issue. Responding to Hannah's dialogue, Clay exhibits more mature emotional and psychological responses than would be commonly seen from a high school junior. Thus, Clay's narration does not appear to be an accurate representation of today's high school population. Secondly, this novel seems to glorify Hannah Baker's decision to commit suicide. Asher provides justification for her choice to take her own life, and this could be dangerous material in the hands of an impressionable teen. Furthermore, this novel flips from the voice of Hannah to the corresponding thoughts of Clay as he listens to the tapes. This format is unique in nature; however, it can be difficult to follow the characters' thought processes at times. It often seems like the narration switches before readers can fully identify with the individual responses. This might not be the most ideal format for adolescent students to connect with. Overall, Asher's novel is an intriguing glimpse into the mind of one girl who struggles with complex issues of life and death. This is probably an appropriate novel to keep in the classroom for interested students. However, as a group of future teachers, we do not consider this book to be an ideal representation of teachable material. It leaves readers with too many unanswered questions and appears to affirm an adolescent's decision to commit suicide.     - This review was written by a group of future teachers from the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I don't know for whom the film was intended nor which audience it is actually gratifying. Certainly it is not for everyone. Technically, it is a fine demonstration of what can be done today to make a large screen shimmer with all the action of a three ring circus. The acting is suitable to the theme and to the characters involved in the story, both &#34;live&#34; and &#34;robotic&#34;. Given the film literacy of the creators, many sources are acknowledged within the film and many more are knowingly alluded to; this is not plagiarism, it is fair use in maintaining traditions as well as  seeking to give them a fresh look and thus perpetuate them.  Perhaps, it should be made a family viewing project so that various differing perspectives can be brought to bear to elicit meaning from the film.<br /> I would recommend it to those who still have a place in their hearts for good old fashioned 1930's-40's schmalz. I have to admit, I was touched by the movie. So, if there is still a mushy core somewhere in your heart, give<br />it a try.

038541627X|5.0|Science- fiction stories in general and Asimov's as example are not, as I understand it, the greatest kind of Literature. They are too thin in their depiction of character and human feeling. What they are in essence is 'stories of ideas' and their great value is in the way they help us learn and think.<br />Asimov is considered one of the most original and greatest of writers in science- fiction.<br />I just read what is his favorite of all stories, and perhaps the most famous science- fiction story of them all, \\"The Last Question\\", In it the ultimate question the question of what will become of us all, what will happen to our universe is asked. There is no one set of characters, but rather successive skimpy characters placed in different locales and times. What begins on earth continues from locations on distant galaxies. The real question the last question is whether the universe will simply die, will follow the second - law- of themodynamics and disintegrate completely. After the time of our sun and the galaxies and after even the trillions of years in which there are no galaxies but only various forms of matter disintegrating the question is asked of the Artificial Intelligence which has been able to keep human existence going. The answer is a wonderful surprise. The story itself is an adventure in creating curiosity or perhaps better of building upon our own natural curiosity to provide an imagined answer.<br />Again as stories in comparison to more character rich and more feeling- rich stories these are not the greatest. But in exploring scientific questions in whetting our curiosity in leading us to 'think' in scientific terms these stories are in the first- rank.

B0009XNUK0|5.0|When my copy of MJ's Number Ones got scratched last summer, I almost bought a new copy. But then a friend of mine suggested I get the Essential MJ instead. I'm glad I listened to her. Both collections are great, but the Essential MJ is MUCH more complete. Unlike the Number Ones collection, the Essential MJ includes several hits from the Jackson 5/Jacksons as well as MJ's early solo hits Ben, Rockin Robin, and Gotta Be There. It also includes all the top 10 charting songs from Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad.     My friend was lucky and somehow got a 3-disc version of the Essential MJ, with the 3rd disc including Scream and Say Say Say. I ordered the 2-disc version from Amazon and then downloaded several other MJ songs (\\"I'll be There,\\" \\"Never Can Say Good-Bye,\\" \\"Who's Loving You?\\" \\"I Wanna Be Where you Are,\\" and \\"Dancin' Machine\\" from his early work, and \\"Workin Day and Night,\\" \\"Say, Say, Say,\\" \\"Scream,\\" and \\"The Earth Song\\" from his work as an adult solo artist).  Now I have three great disks with everything on them. My two daughters (ages 8 and 11) won't let me play anything else in the car!!
B001GCUO16|4.0|If you are an \\"X-Men\\" movie fan; if you are a comicbook-to-movie fan; you will probably like this movie. It has all the tried and true ingredients of the genre: big, hairy superhero fights; the backstory on the Wolverine character which Wolverine fans should appreciate; cool bad guys that look darn near unkillable and of course, the requisite, jaw dropping special effects, CGI wizardry to bring it all to comicbook life. Hugh Jackman does his thing with Wolverine: unstinting in his enthusiatic and passionate portrayal of this much beloved character. On the whole, I really liked it, but of course I like this sort of thing. It probably did not make as big a splash at the box office or the critics, since it is the fourth in line of this franchise. If it had been the first X-Men movie ever, it certainly would have, though. Pretty good for what it is. I would watch it again.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|MJ's Number Ones Collection includes songs that hit #1 in the UK plus one additional track.  While Number Ones is a great collection, The Essential Michael Jackson is much more complete. It includes all of MJ's #1 hits with the Jackson 5 (with the very notable exception of \\"I'll be There\\"), his early solo hits (\\"Ben,\\" \\"Rockin' Robin,\\" and \\"Gotta Be There,\\" which all hit #1 or #2) as well as several other Jackson 5/Jacksons songs (e.g., \\"Shake your Body down to the Ground\\" and \\"Blame it on the Boogie\\"). The Essential MJ also includes ALL the top 10 charting tracks from Off the Wall (including She's Out of My Life and the title track), Thriller (including PYT, Gotta Be Startin' Something, Human Nature, and The Girl is Mine w/Paul McCartney), and Bad (including Just Another Part of Me) plus several other songs from later albums, like In the Closet, Will You Be There, and Heal the World. If you can find the 3-disc version of the Essential MJ (rather than the 2-disc version I have), you get several other songs, including Say Say Say with Paul McCartney, which was a huge #1 hit in the U.S. (I'm not sure why that song is not on Number Ones...). A friend of mine has the 3-disc version so I know it exists out there somewhere!!!    The ONLY songs that you DON'T get on the Essential MJ that you do get on Number Ones are the Earth Song (which was #1 in Europe but not in the U.S), Break of Dawn (also a hit in Europe but not the U.S.) and One More Chance. So when my old copy of Number Ones got scratched up, I purchased the Essential MJ and then downloaded a few songs (e.g., \\"I'll be There,\\" \\"Never Can Say Goodbye,\\" \\"Who's Lovin' You,\\" \\"Dancing Machine,\\" \\"Working Day and Night,\\" \\"Scream,\\" \\"The Earth Song\\" and \\"Say Say Say\\") onto a separate disk so I had all the best MJ songs on 3 discs (2 from the Essential MJ and one of my own creation...)     The Essential MJ also includes information regarding each song's performance on the U.S. pop, R&B, and (sometimes) rock and adult/contemporary charts.     Both collections are great-- after all, they are MJ songs-- but if you want a more complete collection I'd go with the Essential MJ.  Or, at amazon prices, I'd get both.     Happy listening :-)

B002OEBMN4|5.0|Slayer's new CD sees the band going back more to the song writing styles and variety that brings to mind their 1990 masterpiece \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" and 1994's underated \\"Divine Intervention\\".<br />The album features the same raw and punshing sound as their last release Christ Illusion but with much more variety throughout the just shy of 40 minutes World Painted Blood.<br /><br />Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has a much more stronger songwriting presence on this album as he was only responsible for 3 songs on Christ Illusion. It always seems that when he's much more heavily involved in the song writing that the variety in styles reappears on albums.  Christ Illusion was pretty much Kerry King's album and he tends to write in just one style anymore but even he has stepped up his writing on this one. Jeff Hanneman also played all of his guitar parts on this album as Kerry King had been doing most of his rhythm parts for their last few albums.<br /><br />I don't know if it was the fact that much of this album was created in the studio for the first time in their career or what but this album sees the band playing with a vitality that they really haven't exhibited in spades since 1994's Divine Intervention.<br /><br />And for people complaining about the production, it's fine. It sounds like a more raw version of the production on Christ Illusion and the guitars have a bit more of a buzz saw sound to them at times.  Dave Lombardo's drums also have a very natural sound on this album which is so good to hear again in this day and age of pro tools digital recording.  Tom Araya's vocals could be a hair higher in the mix on some songs but there's also some actual singing on here which he really hasn't done since 1988's South of Heaven.<br /><br />There's not a bad song on here and the album is super strong from start to finish. If this does for some reason end up being the final Slayer album, it's a super strong way for this legendary metal band to go out.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|It can not be overstated enough.  This movie is beyond terrible.  It goes past so bad it's good (Battlefield Earth) straight into so bad it will make you vomit.  In your living room, with no warning whatsoever.  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a looooong time.  Pointless, dumb and utterly thoughtless.  I like a good popcorn movie too (Desperado, Transporter) but skip this at all costs.    Fans of action should be disappointed.  It's mashup of special forces/sci-fi action is bland and banal.  I can not believe they spent $175 million on this movie.  It looks like a third of that.  Fans of the G.I. Joe property will be angry for days after watching.  I am all for reinventing characters or using a new perspective, but this story is so idiotic that you will only wish it never happened.  What happens if there is a sequel?  Do we have to press forward with these hackneyed stereotypical good guy/bad guys?  The only thing one could hope for is a series reboot ala Hulk.  And that probably has the same chance of happening as Channing Tatum winning an oscar.
0446618306|4.0|I like reading Nicholas Sparks books. I couldnt put down this book I was really enjoying it. When I finished it I had so many different emotions. It makes you think about the characters for awhile after you finish reading it.I just wished that there was more happiness in Johns life. It was upsetting that he didnt have anybody..
B001N26GFM|5.0|Boy In the Striped Pajamas is one of my all time favorite movies. Two unlikely boys become friends. For the son of a German officer who does not share the nature of his job or the camp in which he works, the boys new home near a concentration camp is an adventure.  His inquisitive nature allows him to befriend a boy whom he believes lives on a farm. The boy whom he befriends who wears the funny striped pajamas is also protected by his father and friends concerning the true nature of the \\"farm\\". A heart wrenching film, the boyish nature of play above all adult concern, a must see!
0307473473|5.0|This was 2nd best only to THE KITE RUNNER, and rightly so! I really enjoyed picking the brain of the late Stieg Larsson through THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. While he weaves this plot on some wild and icy curves, he aims his objective straight forward. And like a well shot arrow, this shoots straight through the center of the target with no other aim!<br /><br />Without even thinking otherwise, we find ourselves pulling for Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist who has set himself up, and will have to serve a small prison sentence. And we also find ourselves despising Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, despite his supposed well-earned victory over Blomkvist. And when you think all hope is lost for him, we find ourselves bracing for what Henrik Vanger has in store for him. At his request, Vanger wishes for Blomkvist to investigate a disappearance over forty years old, his niece, Harriet, in hopes that she isn't already dead. And while Blomkvist reluctantly agrees, he will do nothing but his best.<br /><br />Eventually, enter Lisbeth Salander, a girl with a troubled past who gets down to business. At some point, Aspergers symptoms are pointed out in the you prodigy, yet her wit is not undermined. And together, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander find something horrific, something possibly damaging to the Vanger family itself.<br /><br />I'd say be fairly warned. Stieg Larsson writes of brutal sexual assault, while at other times he approaches the subject with an untamed one track mind. But what he does, he does quite well. What appeared to be a brutally long and excruciating read turned into a very methodical and well thought out work that went by quickly! And the reason it went to quickly is because Larsson really knows his craft, he knows his beloved Sweden, and he knows how to crank out a great story! Rather disturbing in some parts, yes, and some parts quite sad. But he always knows how to keep the reader interested. This is already an international bestseller. Despite some parts in there that didn't quite go with my standards at all times, this should instantly be a worldwide sensation! I look forward to more Stieg Larsson in the future.quite go with my standards at all times, this should instantly be a worldwide sensation! I look forward to more Stieg Larsson in the future.

B002NOAF9W|4.0|Lets get right to the point; If you own the SACD version of GYYYO, you will NOT be impressed, with this new edition.  That said, it's worth the [...], to own a piece of nostalgic history.  Yes, they could've combined Cd's, 1&2, on one disc  I thought the DVD video was good, not great; no better than the Criterion version, of \\"Gimme Shelter\\". In actuality, not as good, because on GS, you have the option of DTS audio. I personally think the video quality of the Criterion disc is superior.  It was nice to finally see Prodigal Sun & You Gotta Move, with decent audio & video.  BUT; the 2nd CD has the EXACT SAME MUSIC!  Great to see Janis Joplin, shakin' her booty, & Hendrix jamming backstage with Mick Taylor; nice touches.  After you compress the CD on ITunes/version 9.0.2, it still sounds good, with fabulous dynamic range, BUT, the SACD, is almost as good/compressed, & as good, if not better, with an SACD decoder.  BB King, & the Turners' are a fine completion to the package.  If you LOVE the Stones, [...], seems trivial, when it's a Mick Taylor era compilation.  Now if only Mick would release \\"Ladies & Gentlemen\\", in 5.1/DTS/surround sound.................................................................................  FYI: I still feel, with today's technology, it could've been better.  The Beatles, & The Who remasters, are prime examples, of modern technology.
B002NXSRX4|4.0|After the terrible travesty which is Transformers, I was a bit concerned that the other Hasbro franchise would have the same fate. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is actually quite good. The story is pretty decent, exactly the type of caper that Cobra from the 80's cartoon series would try to pull off. There was a lot of action, the dialogue was well written for the most part. Special Effects were top notch. It didn't resort to awful toilet humor and extreme sexual situations as the Transformers movies did. It is much more acceptable for younger viewers.    The only minor concern story-wise is the way they handled the Baroness and Zartan. I hope Baroness is still with Cobra in the sequels, it just wouldn't be the same without her. As for Zartan, he really didn't do much in this movie, so I assume they plan to give him (and the Dreadnoks) a bigger role in the sequels, I hope with his long hair and trademark facial tattoos.    I recommend this movie for anyone who likes action and special effects. One of the best action movies of the year.
0679759328|4.0|Hotel Du Lac is short book about a woman's escape to a Swiss hotel after something socially difficult has occurred in London.  The difficulty is revealed though slightly later in the book.    The heroine, Edith Hope, is a writer of romantic fiction and is very sad person in love with a married man.  At the hotel, she meets quite a few strange and wealthy characters.  I didn't really enjoy the first part of the book where she first forms impressions of these fairly vacuous people and then converses and gets acquainted with them.  Even though the book has a modern setting, it could have been set in many different times and very few changes would have to be made.  This is reflective of the Hotel Du Lac which is lost in time.    The second half of the book is more interesting as we discover more about Edith and her reasons for fleeing her life.  She is also presented with a very interesting proposition that requires a difficult decision.    I can see how some would find this book a little boring.  Some might call the language flowery but it's appropriate when describing a romance novelist at a Swiss hotel on a lake.    I definitely have thought about this book quite a bit after finishing it and I think I've grown to appreciate it more after a couple of days of thought.    I liked it a lot but it won't be everyone's cup of tea.
B002MRROKS|3.0|Being a long time, die hard Nirvana fan since I was a kid in the early 1990's, and going to my local record den and finding the latest imports and bootlegs by my favorite band, I procured this very concert probably a dozen years ago. I always thought this to be a great performance, with high energy, a great set list, and that \\"something\\" that keeps you putting in your illicit buy again and again. Having said that, I was pretty thrilled to learn that the 8/30/92 Nirvana show at the Reading Festival was being officially released. I picked up the cd this morning, along with the 20th anniversary edition of Bleach's release, the DVD was \\"still in the back and hasn't been put out yet\\" - so says the couldn't-care-less salesman at my local Wal*Mart.       On the way to work, I popped in the Reading CD and was overly pleased with the improvement on the sound quality from bootleg copies of this show that have been circulating for years. - I was, however, totally irritated with the general production of this performance for it's release, and by that, I mean this; they took out a lot of the between-song talking, and goofing around, which is, in part, what made a Nirvana concert a Nirvana concert. Now, before everyone starts blasting me, I understand that some of it had to be deleted for continuity, space on the CD, etc, etc.. But how do you edit out the band mocking themselves by turning the intro of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' into a jam on Boston's 'More Than A Feeling' with Krist singing (poorly)? Or when Kurt announces that the next song is for his then 12-day-old-daughter, and his wife, and proceeds to ask the crowd to yell 'Courtney We Love You!\\" - That song was 'All Apologies'. Now we all know that no one likes Courtney Love, but that was a moment, that accurately reflects the vibe of the times in Nirvana's history, and should have been left in. Like Courtney, or hate her, it was a pretty touching moment, and a rare thing for Kurt to do at a concert.      Another that thatdrove me absolutely up a wall about this CD is the insertion of fake crowd cheering at the beginning of every song, and it sounds like the same canned sound clip of the crowd cheering is used in a good portion of the songs in the set. This is especially annoying, and almost comical to hear by the end of the disc. It really takes away from the experience, especially after listening to the bootleg version for so long, whose quality was not nearly as good, but at least it was real, and raw. To put this all in a nutshell, The show was epic enough on it's own, don't mess with it.   Anyone even a little familiar with the time line of Nirvana's music knows that songs like 'All Apologies', \\"School\\", \\"Sliver\\", and \\"Been a Son\\" were virtually unknown songs in 1992, so hearing an erupting cheer when they start playing 'Been a Son' sounds totally ridiculous. At least to me.. Maybe I'm being overly critical, but it's really annoying, and like I said earlier, comical to listen to by half way into the show.    Stick to the DVD, people. All the \\"little things\\" are in there that give this show it's charm in the first place, and yes, the stuff that was deleted from the CD.. but the same annoying addition of fake crowd cheering is on both the CD and the DVD.. Oh well..    -Phiber Optik
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|To anyone who is a PT fan, this album is a MUST buy. Everytime a new PT album comes out, I always end up thinking that the new album is better than the last.  Why?  Because as they release their albums, you can hear how much they have grown in their musical abilities as artists (NOT entertainers.)  I did end up seeing PT live in Chicago on 9-22-09 where they opened with this album.  I had not heard any of the music off the album at the time I was at the concert.  However, I was blown away by this album.  In my opinion as a die hard PT fan, I think this is their best work to date.  But as artists they continue to surprise me with every new album.  The beautiful lyrics as well as the music just grabs you and sucks you in for the ultimate ride of your life.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|If one just overlooks the scalping in this movie(Tarantino's violence just rises a little exponentially from movie to movie,from Mr. Blonde way back in Res. Dog onwards),the performances by the cast is just exceptional,with a special mention going to Christoph Waltz. Diane Kruger is probably the most beautiful and glamourous blonde on celluloid in such a long time,she has heavyweight written all over her.Throw in your exceptional Tarantino soundtrack and you have a very entertaining and fun movie(if you overlook the scalping)
B002UD56I6|4.0|The thing about the movie is that there are not any real surprises- MJ probably wanted to play it \\"safe\\". He could be testing the waters to see the competition and have one last attempt at world domination,or just join the oldies, Vegas set and perform Billie Jean  ad nauseum and get paid handsomely for it. Oh how fate has other plans. This movie could be described as MJ \\"unplugged\\". There are no safety nets,he dances brilliantly, he sings soulfully and indeed looks at the top of his game. This portrait could be as honest as you could get of MJ. We are peeking into his rehearsals and he really makes his co-workers punch above their weight. Its great watching him communicate to the band what he wants-he is a font of music and emotion and it just oozes out of him. When he does Billie Jean you get goose bumps.This movie once and for all shows what a true genius he was, what an amazing performer, what a loss and we will probably not see another like him again.
160094048X|5.0|I have not made a receipe from Isa or Terry that hasn't been delicious, and the recipes in this book will be no exception!  Sweet Wine Biscuits with Sesame?  Peanut Butter Blondies? Peanut Apple Pretzel Drops?  The recipes feature ingredients that are easy to find (for the most part) and relatively easy to put together.  The results really are always fantastic.  The Chocolate Chip Cookies are amazing, as are the Mexican Chocolate Snickerdoodles.  These cookies are suitable for everyone-vegan and nonvegan!  The pictures are mouthwatering and the layout is simple and easy to follow.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves cookies-vegans and nonvegans alike!  You will not be disappointed.
B000W7FDBM|5.0|This is the movie that set the tone for the series. It is a masterful piece of directing--adapted from J. K. Rowling's book. The actors were well-cast for their roles and aside from the children, I think Snape's character is the best. After wearing out my VHS copy of this movie, I'm happy to now have the DVD version.
0385504225|1.0|You should skip them all.  There are about 200 pages of story, the rest is moralistic droning.  I started skipping the sermons and paging forward to where the story resumed.    What's worse, the plot twists are so obvious they were a little insulting.  Wait for the movie, I'm sure they'll be able to stretch out the story to fill two hours - if there are a lot of credits.

1401216676|5.0|Batman: The Killing Joke is by far one of the greatest one-shot graphic novels ever written, Moore is fortunate that it was of such caliber as to deserve inclusion in the mainstream Batman canon.  The Joker is the single most evil non-superpowered being in the DC universe, and almost nothing is known about who he was before becoming the arch-nemesis of Batman.  While curiosity abounds for fans, even more prefer that he maintain this aura of mystery since it is believed that his pre-villain life was not one that would have been considered anything worth writing about; it is because of he IS the Joker that he means anything in the DCU at all.    All that aside, Alan Moore - the creative genius behind such works as [[ASIN:140120841X V for Vendetta]], [[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]], [[ASIN:0958578346 From Hell]], [[ASIN:0930289226 Swamp Thing ]], [[ASIN:1563896656 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]] and many others - took a chance and in 1988 presented the comic community with what DC has accepted as the official Joker origin story.  WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD  The Killing Joke is about madness.  The Joker has escaped from Arkham Asylum and is setting about a new and truly evil scheme; unrivaled since he murdered Jason Todd/Robin #2 in [[ASIN:B001HZSVH6 Batman: A Death in the Family]].  While Batman is frantically trying to track him down, the Joker has purchased a dilapidated carnival (like something you'd expect to find in a 21st century teen slasher flick, but in his hands is decidedly worse) and is now off to secure his \\"main attraction\\".  Later at the home of Commissioner Gordon, Barbara answers the door to find a sick fixed smile shooting her through her spine, crippling her; after several off-color disabled jokes, Gordon is kidnapped and spirited away to the the Joker's carnival of horrors.  (Moore and DC received a hailstorm of praise and criticism for rendering Batgirl a parapellegic, but the decision stuck and arguably many good, if not great, stories came fromit.)  Gordon regains consciousness to find himself being stripped down by a host of sideshow freaks and lead at the Joker's behest to a House of Horrors ride filled with the Joker's own snap-shots of Barbara fully undressed and in pain and filled with the Joker and his cronies singing a sardonic song about lunacy (GOD I WISH I KNEW THE TUNE!!!); all of this intended to drive Gordon insane.  Batman uncovers the Joker's plot and rushes to the carnival to stop him; a chase ensues through a booby-trap-laden house of mirrors in which the Joker states that he's proven his point with Gordon's unquestionable descent into madness: \\"All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy!\\"  The joker goes on in his analysis with Batman, stating that he too is crazy, but won't admit it and tries to get him to accept it.  The final confrontation between them is left a mystery, but it is clear that the Joker - after decades of campy portrayals - has most definitely re-earned the title of most evil comic book villain.  Throughout the story, the Joker offers flashbacks to his life before becoming the monster he is today.  He was once a technician at the ACE Chemical Plant who quit his job to become a stand-up comedian.  Unfortunately he fails miserably and worries about how he's going to support his very pregnant-in-the-late-trimester wife and soon-to-arrive baby.  He decides to make fast, easy money by throwing in his lot with criminals looking to rip off a playing card company next door to the chemical plant and he offers his services to get through unnoticed.  So as to protect his own identity, the gangsters present him with his disguise: The Red Hood.  While in discussion for the crime, a couple of cops show up to tell him that his wife has died while operating a defunct bottle heater.  In his shock, he tries to back out of the crime since he no longer has a reason to go through with it; but the gangsters hold him to it.  Later on, they break into the plant, buteverything goes wrong as the cops show up and take down the gangsters and that Batman appears to apprehend who he believes to be the Red Hood.  Whether he jumped, fell or was pushed is unclear, but the man landed in a vat of chemicals that washed him out of the factory.  When he reaches shore and removes his disguise and sees his reflection in a puddle of rainwater, he begins to laugh, turns and reveals himself as the Joker.  At the end of this story follows another one from the mini-series [[ASIN:1401215890 Batman: Black & White]] called here \\"An Innocent Guy\\" about a man - clearly disturbed, making the judgment that if anyone is to truly live a life devoted to good, then they must commit an act of evil to know that that is what they really want.  After laying out his basic concept, he arrives at the conclusion that he must kill Batman.  He lays out his plan in disturbing detail and closes with the a that after this one act of evil, he can go on to live a thoroughly good life and go to heaven when he dies.  Masterfully written by Alan Moore and beautifully illustrated by Brian Bolland, Batman: The Killing Joke is a must have for all comic collectors.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I LOVE THIS WHOLE MOVIE COLLECTION ROCKY IS A GREAT SERIES OF MOVIES !!!!!  ONE OF THE BEST BOXING MOVIES EVER!!!
1563894696|5.0|***It would be a good idea to have read [[ASIN:1401207529 Batman: Year One]] before reading this graphic novel.***  Batman: The Long Halloween is a master piece of literary and artistic craftsmanship from Jeph Loeb ([[ASIN:1563898683 Batman: Dark Victory]], [[ASIN:1401223176 Batman: Hush]], [[ASIN:1401202209 Superman/Batman Vol. 1: Public Enemies]]) and Tim Sale ([[ASIN:1563892731 Batman: Haunted Knight]], [[ASIN:1401207170 Catwoman: When in Rome (Batman)]], [[ASIN:1563895293 Superman for All Seasons]]) that served as the inspiration for the 2008 billion-dollar-grossing box office blockbuster [[ASIN:B001GZ6QDS The Dark Knight]].  A conservative estimate places this story about a year after \\"Batman: Year One\\"; Batman is an established crime fighter feared by the mob, James Gordon is an honorable GCPD Captain, and Harvey Dent is the crusading district attorney.  All three of these men want the same thing: to rid Gotham City of organized crime and its master crime lord Carmine \\"the Roman\\" Falcone, and the three decide to form a pact to bring down the \\"Roman Empire\\".  Caught up in the madness of this seemingly impossible task are a host of what the cops and mob call \\"freaks\\" (costumed criminals) including: The Joker, Solomon Grundy, Poison Ivy, The Riddler, The Scarecrow, The Mad Hatter, and Catwoman (who between her double life as Selina Kyle, the on-again-off-again main squeeze of Bruce Wayne, and her nights playing catch-me-if-you-can with Batman, has set her own interests in the \\"Roman Empire\\" (for reasons not fully explained until \\"Catwoman: When in Rome\\")).    However, in the midst of the good guys versus the bad guys, a new player has arisen.  Known only as Holiday (because he strikes on holidays), this serial killer is stalking all persons affiliated with the Roman Empire and Falcone's chief rival Salvatore \\"Boss\\" Maroni.  The original story took place over 13 issues for 13 months from Halloween to Halloween, during which time both Falcone and Maroni have suffered incalculable losses and a blow is delivered to the three key players that may threaten to destroy them all as the newest as most conflicted of freaks arises to join Batman's Rogues Gallery.  This is a phenomenal story that was originally adapted from \\"Batman Annual #14: Eye of the Beholder\\" which cataloged the downfall of Harvey Dent into the villainous Two-Face; TLH simply elaborates upon this same concept in a way that is far more satisfying.  The fun of this story is trying to figure out the main mystery: Who is Holiday?  There are a row of suspects put forward throughout the story, among whom include: Catwoman, Harvey Dent, even Falcone and Maroni themselves!  While the mystery is revealed at the end, there still remains the question as to whether or not they were the only only one acting as Holiday (for more on this go to: <[...]>).  Do not miss this masterpiece or its companions \\"Haunted Knight\\" and \\"Dark Victory\\".
0060776757|5.0|I love U2 and I love this book. The pictures are fantastic and the format is great. It starts out with descriptions of each member's childhood experiences and how they united to form the band. Then it is chronologically divided into album and tour phases. Each artist and their manager takes turns describing circumstances influencing decisions made as well as inspirations, creative techniques, family situations, and intersting people and experiences. Of course Bono has more to say than the others, but what else would one expect? They seem to be candid and honest. Every U2 fan should own this book. :)
B000FFJYCU|5.0|I had seen the movie when it was released, several times, and liked more than very much. But I was curious to see if it could resist the pass of time.   It did better than that. The plot is good, but the action scenes were superb. Even if we are now used to see \\"on-board\\" footage in every F1 race.  The cars are beautyfull, perhaps the beautyest of all times, the technical aspects well shown, the old \\"circus\\" at it´s best. Pilots were the most important part of the man-machine team, and the cars were still cars and not fighter planes on wheels.  A must for all fine car lovers
1416562605|5.0|Amazingly stark description of  India. Written in a very different format it explores the corruption and class based society still prevalent in India. Very much like a book version of Slumdog Millionaire - leaves you with sadness about the struggles of the common man in India.
B002HWUU1I|5.0|I've been listening to \\"Strict Joy\\" continuously for the past week and find more to like about it every time.  The genius lies in the poetry of the words, the emotion in the music, the raw feeling in the \\"story of two lovers who danced both edges of the knife\\".  I know that artists of any kind find more inspiration when their own emotions are intense--such as those of falling in and out of love.  Glen and Marketa have harnessed their emotions and channeled them into an album full of beautiful, bittersweet music.  Marketa's voice is never more beautiful than when she sings \\"Fantasy Man\\" and \\"I Have Loved You Wrong\\".  And what a way to end the latter song with the repitition of the same phrase \\"on my mind\\" over and over.  Isn't that the way of love--not being able to get your lover (or former lover) out of your mind?  Glen's voice is for the most part quieter and more gentle than in some of his previous songs.  I think that \\"Back Broke\\" is one of the best songs on the album.  The sadness, the hope, the acceptance  are all tempered by the plaintive, heartbreaking melody of the violin as it brings the song and the album to an end. The lush background music and their combined voices on most of the songs show us that despite the failure of their romance, they still can make beautiful music together.    This is quickly becoming my favorite album even though I loved \\"Once\\" and the \\"Swell Season\\" albums.  It will captivate you too from the first song until the last note.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|First of all, let me say that this is a 5-star series in my opinion...this is probably my favorite series that was on TV - I've watched it ever since I was a kid. This being said, there are some problems with the product that a buyer should be aware of. The trays that hold the DVDs do not hold them well - a few of the DVDs fell out of the trays the first time I used this set. Also, I did not like the set up at all (sometimes the trays wouldn't fit together properly while trying to put the set away). I went out and bought a case to hold the DVDs instead, which in itself, is not a big deal, but if you pay the $300 or so for this, the organization of the DVDs should be a lot better in my opinion. Also, if you do not know what happens in the episode according to the title only, you will have a problem with this set. There is no episode/disc guide, so you will have problems selecting the episode you want to watch. Also, one more thing - although there are some cool things in the special features disc, I really thought that the disc would contain more interesting things. Don't get me wrong, I loved seeing John DeLancie start everything off, and some of the features were interesting, I just expected a lot more to be on this disc then what there actually was.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars (for the product). 5 stars for the show.
B002NXSRVG|2.0|Honestly, I am not an avid fan of the G.I. animated series or the comic book published by Marvel comics back in the 80's, therefore my knowledge of the G.I. Joe universe is very limited. I am however, aware of its characters seeing as how a bunch of my friends used to collect the little action figures. \\"G.I. JOE: RISE OF THE COBRA\\" directed by Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) was written during the writer's strike and is geared towards a specific audience. I lowered my expectations when I saw this film on dvd, (hey, no writers on duty) and I know this movie was inspired by toys. So how does it hold up?<br /><br />The M.A.R.S. industry had developed a new nanotech technology that was used to cure cancer and is now being re-tooled to be used for military purposes. This nanotech can eat through anything and is able to decimate a city with a small warhead. Arms dealer McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) had pitched the technology to N.A.T.O. and the new tech is about to be transported to a NATO base when C.O.B.R.A. a group of high-tech terrorists attack the group of grunts led by Duke (Tatum Channing, Fighting) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans). However, Cobra gets intercepted by a secret counter-terrorist unit called G.I.JOE. The set up for an encounter of high-tech weaponry between COBRA led by the Doctor (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and members Storm shadow, (Lee Byung Hyun, A Bittersweet Life), Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) and the Baroness (Sienna Miller) and the JOES led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid) with members Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Breaker (Saïd Taghmaoui) and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) with new members Duke and Ripcord joining the battle for supremacy with the dangerous nanotech weapon as the final prize.<br /><br />Leave it to Hollywood to try and capitalize on the success of the \\"Transformers\\" franchise. While there is nothing remotely wrong with this practice, I would have wished that they would have at least come up with a movie that would appear to have been carefully thought out. The plot in \\"Rise of the Cobra\\" is pretty routine and unimaginative; the label of the \\"Real American Hero\\" is disposed with and replaced with \\"when all fails, we don't\\", the plot devices and elements are so predictable and even the twist in the final act was too forced. The film is your typical good vs. evil action movie with an overload of rehearsed explosions and eye candy special effects. Stephen Sommers makes no attempts in trying to add anything intricate plot wise, he knows his intended audience, kids and teenagers who enjoy boisterous displays of senseless action and visual effects.<br /><br />The action scenes in \\"G.I. Joe\\" are elaborate, loud, stylish and slick. Sommers have a lot of experience in handling caricaturist characters by hiding the flaws of the script by wall to wall action. The movie can be fun to watch, and the slick visuals do have its charm. The mayhem in the film is nicely staged with quick editing tricks, occasional slow-mo that follows the movements of the Joes as they spring into combat. The film does have a very nifty chase scene in the streets of Paris, that scene alone could have saved the movie from mediocrity, and sadly this is also the film's best scenes, as the other action sequences of the film did not match its quality. I would have expected for the final encounter to be much more intense and decisive than for a chase that occurs in the film's halfway point to steal the show. Also, the visual effects are good, but effects without the emotion of high stakes can feel rather superficial and too unreal.<br /><br />The characterization in the film falls into a sad display of cinematic shameless caricatures. I know these characters are toys but I thought Hasbro was selling these for the toys themselves to tell a story. The costumes and gimmicks does appear to have been inspired by the toys, and Lee Byung Hyun and Ray Park makes for a good Storm shadow and Snake Eyes, their past brings a small amount of depth but wasn't fully utilized; but Tatum Channing and Marlon Wayans were miscast and felt very stereotypical. Sienna Miller needed more `gutsy', ruthless aura for her role; Rachel Nichols and Levitt were just so ineffective to the point of almost embarrassing themselves. The links between the Baroness and Duke were also too perfunctory and was obviously added to stimulate some romantic angle that was unneeded. Flashbacks were used to add character development and while the past between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow showed some potential; it just couldn't be the right element to capitalize on.<br /><br />With \\"Van Helsing\\" and two movies of \\"The Mummy\\" under his belt, Sommers does know how to shoot eye candy action sequences and repetitive, stylish effects. One should know what he is in for when watching a movie directed by Sommers, it may be fun, popcorn, brainless, unrisky entertainment meant for the general audiences. The G.I. Joe franchise maybe expected not to have any real depth or inventive characterization; and for this expectation, Sommers may be the right man for the job. The movie gives hints of a sequel, and while I knew off the bat that I wasn't the movie's intended audience, I can see how some people can find this movie fun. \\"G.I.

B0006L16N8|4.0|I recently saw an independent movie called Young At Heart.  One of the songs in that movie really touched me, and, of course, it was written by Coldplay.  I'm a real fan of this group and have been for quite some time.  The album was an older one that I didn't have, but I have enjoyed many of the songs.
0385341008|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It took some getting used to reading \\"letters\\" as opposed to regular written \\"novel\\" type context.  A must read for any book club or avid single reader.
0061438294|5.0|The book is very easy to read, has pictures, and is easy to flip through.    Sure, you may read a few pages and say \\"duh, I knew that\\" or \\"thats just common sense\\", but there is bound to be many observations in the book that you did not realize go on around you everyday. Due to where I grew up, I would consider myself very street smart. Yet, this book did open my eyes to quite a few tells or cues that I never noticed.     Give it a shot, even if u are not a avid reader.......This book is friendly to those of us who like to flip through pages and find the good stuff.

B00154GEFU|4.0|No one should have unrealistic expectation about what this album should be. i think we should feel good about what this album is....entertaining music with an overwhelming focus on nostalgia in places. Asia is not breaking new ground here but, were you really expecting them to? I personally had a great time with this record. There were three specific moments where You swear you are listening to the ASIA record from 1982. the opening track which all the other reviewers have flagged as good is one...kind of Heat of the Moment 2 if you please. My favorites are Shadow of a Doubt and the closing track really make me feel nostalgic. Overall a fine cd, certainly the finest offering by this band since AQUA. People, dont overanalyze this album just enjoy it on its own merits it really is a solid effort by aging musicians who are taking one more shot at recapturing lighting in a bottle...i guess \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" (wink wink!!)
0307394549|5.0|I have been cooking for 15 years.  I have been cooking professionally for 8 years.  I went to Johnson & Wales for 4 years. I love this book.  I can honestly say I use it almost every day for my residences.  I've made about 20 of the cookies in this books and all of them have come out amazing!  I find it very comprehensive and if you read it and actually know some basic techniques it is a great book.  Plus,although a little froo froo for me, the \\"gifting\\" ideas at the back of the book are neat and it also gives you ideas on equipment you should have.  And with Ebay and other culinary supply stores you should be able to find them cheaply.  Hope this helps! A+ book!
B002H3F7F6|1.0|Love Sting! HATE HATE HATE this garbage CD! My employer bought this to add to the collection of relaxing music we play in our reception area. 90% of our clients BEG us to turn it off. Yes, I understand it is winter music. However, if you get the slightest bit depressed during winter and the holidays, this will drive you over the edge. It would make a good soundtrack to a prisoner of war movie. Hard to understand the words and when you read some of the lyrics you are shocked. Why would I want to hear about the hurdy gurdy man lying down to freeze to death among snarling dogs? I can't find any redeeming qualities to this music. Winter is my second favorite season after autumn. This music tells you nothing about the beauty of the season. I have never listened to such  cold, dark, maudlin music in my life. Just goes to prove if you have the name you can get anything produced. Buyer beware! The musicians are talented, but if you are having a bad day, listening to this will make it worse.

0385504225|2.0|While I admire Mr. Brown's creativity and clearly planned method of writing, I am quite tired of the repetitive nature of his story lines. Mr. Brown seems to have become too comfortable with this subject matter by being repetitive, dragged out with the philosophical ideas of the \\"Masonic\\" world. If you've never read his previous books on the subject matter, this may be interesting and enlightening to you. If however you are up to beat with his previous novels on the subject of Free Masons, then be prepared to be disappointed, maybe even fed up for the last few chapters of this book. Hope they don't turn this into a movie, or maybe if they do it won't disappoint as much as the book.    Having said that, I may very well read his next release if it's not about the Masonic culture. He is eloquent and thoughtful in his art; does gads of research and really gets into his story.

0316017922|5.0|In the never-ending nature vs. nurture debate, Malcolm Gladwell comes down squarely on the side of nurture in \\"Outliers.\\" That's the fast and dirty gist of the book. Gladwell probably won't convince those on the nature side of the question, and in the popular imagination I doubt this will be the last word by a long shot. Still, he is an elegant, persuasive writer who gives us much to think about.    According to Gladwell, talent and hard work are only part of what makes someone successful. They are important, but circumstances have a lot to due with success as well. He gives examples to back up his claim. In Canada there is an elite Junior Hockey League, out of which many prominent NHL Players have come. In the team, he noticed a disproportionate number born in January. The reason that is that the league determines eligibility by calendar year, so children born on January 1 play in the same league as those born on December 31 in the same year. So adolescents born earlier in the year would be bigger and more mature than their younger counterparts, thereby being identified as better athletes, leading to extra coaching and a better chance of being selected for the elite hockey league. That is an example of cumulative advantage. Another example is with the disparities in education results between lower-class and middle-class children. The tests in early childhood that Gladwell quotes show no significant difference between the two groups at first, but with each year, the lower-class kids fall further behind. The reason is that middle-class parents over the summer constantly expose their children to learning opportunities that simply don't exist in most lower-class homes.    An interesting part of the book for me was his 10,000-hour rule- You can only truly become an expert in something once you've practiced it for 10,000 hours- natural talent makes a difference, but not that much of a difference. Gladwell gives examples from the experiences of the Beatles, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and others to demonstrate how, through their unique circumstances and opportunities, they were able to practice their craft for 10,000 hours.    \\"Outliers\\" is an excellent book which will hopefully spark a national discussion about success and the factors that create it. And maybe, just maybe, we can talk about how to change circumstances so that more people are successful. Much in his book is no doubt debatable, but it should be debated, and read, and pondered over.
B001FB55I0|4.0|This movie is pretty unique in the fact that it has 2 male lead characters. (Christian Bale as John Connor and Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright) and suprisingly, it works. Thy manage to pull it off without eclipsing each other. Performances were good specially Worthington's even thou Bale did a terrific job as well and Anton Yelchin's performance as Kyle Reese was really believable (This guy also played the Russian genius kid in the new Star Trek). Effects were good, story was enjoyable and interesting. They even throw a couple of nods to the previous terminators that were really cool. All in all, not as era-defining as Terminator 2 but a worthy addition to the series nevertheless. (Unlike Rise of the Machines, which I think we can all agree, it's OK to pretend it never happened).
0316044695|5.0|Great read.
B001K3JF7K|4.0|For the most part, I like this CD. She seems to be returnng to her \\"roots.\\" For a while there her husband, who became her manager/director/whatever, had her doing some strange things and I didn't like those releases. But now on this CD she is back to her smooth jazz genre, music I can enjoy driving the highway as well as at home \\"kicking back.\\"
B002H3F7F6|1.0|Ok, so your venture in to pop-jazz turned out great.  Then you went to mainstream pop, which might have been dreary if not for some middle-eastern flavor.  But now you've signed up with the wrong label.  Elevators won't even move to this music.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Loved this DVD...yes, its true that much of this has been covered in the Fast Food Nation, Super-Size Me etc etc...but this really captures the sinister nature of the greed involved. As pointed out in the documentary, there are multiple unintended consequences of corporate greed. Sometimes the visual is more potent than the written word, and to witness the inhumane treatment of animals makes this more powerful than the best-selling books. The DVD also offers hope - i.e. things don't have to be this way, and we can make changes by the way we purchase. Excellent.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Now I will admit that I have never even seriously thought about purchasing a MB cd though I have enjoyed his tv performances. This is just not my kind of music. However in my attempt to branch out a bit, I gave \\"Crazy Love\\" a try and found myself really enjoying the music. From the first beats of \\"Cry Me A River\\" I was hooked. By the time I got to \\"Heartache Tonight\\" and Baby (you've got what it takes) I was a fan. As a person who doesn't like to listen to \\"old standards\\" and song covers, I was skeptical I would enjoy it. But this cd left me in a better happier mood than before I started and I was in a great mood for hours after I stopped listening. Thanks, Michael! I needed that!
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Interesting take on the band as well as the heavy metal industry.  Shows a totally different side of Metallica and the business that is the  band.
0385504225|5.0|I found it difficult to put the book down expecially since I worked and lived in the Washington area for 30 years before retiring to Nebraska.  As a result, I knew almost all the landmarks, residential areas, streets, and parks mentioned in the book.  And to top it off, I lived close to the Masonic temple in Alexandria, VA on the blue/yellow subway line !!!   I rate this book outstanding and I can see why it took Dan Brown 5 years to research and write this convoluted book.  Thanks you.  Les
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The product was exactly as advertised.  It was used but hardly and I love it.  Quick shipping and shipping cost was reasonable.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I've seen this movie three times now, at intervals from the release last summer through last Tues night, and \\"UP\\" gets better every time I see it.  There are both overt and subtle funny bits galore!<br /><br />Pixar lives up to its amazingly high standards of quality of animation AND storytelling in this far-fetched, yet overwhelmingly fun film.<br /><br />If you are like me you don't often laugh out loud while you watch movies, but I did frequently during this show.  The devotion of the now cranky old man to his wife's memory and a promise he made her drives the storyline, while the \\"small mailman\\" (boy scoutish) child provides a solid helping of comic relief.<br /><br />You will come to love lines like: \\"SQUIRREL!\\", \\"I just met you and I love you!\\", \\"Oh, it's before!\\", and many more.<br /><br />If you are a fan of other Pixar films you will certainly enjoy this one too.  I'd say that it's as good as any of the other Pixar movies that have been released.  I think that the thing that makes them great is that the folks at Pixar are able to take the humor in everyday life and place it in incredibly unlikely situations.  Pixars stories also grasp our imaginations today the same way that movie serials and Buck Rogers did for members of previous generations.<br /><br />Thanks for another top-notch film.  May you continue doing so for decades to come!

B002NXSRVG|2.0|I rented GI Joe having fairly low expectations for the movie.  Being a fan of the cartoon from my childhood, I at least wanted to see the new attempt at the franchise.      First of all, the acting is horrendous, even when you factor in the macho/roided out nature of the characters.  Of course, the cast is a collection of C-list stars, so you can't expect too much out of them.  I would have been happy if they had all made like Snake-Eyes and stayed silent, especially Wayans.      The action is almost too-fast. I barely had time to register what was going on.  One minute the new Joes are training, the next they're being attacked at their base, then they're running around Paris.  Combined with all their flashy gadgets, the pace was bewildering.  And in between these rushes of action were these half-conceived, afterthought backstories on a few of the major characters, mostly Duke & the Baroness, and then Snake-Eyes & Storm Shadow.  I know the first movie in a series is supposed to establish some backstories, but for GI Joe, it was hastily done and incomplete.  The team was already together with no explanation of how the team was even conceived, funded, how the team was put together, etc.  I felt like the movie picked up in the middle instead of the beginning.    There was just too much cheesiness to the story, and that's saying a lot for a movie based on a toy & cartoon.  The producers were obviously cashing in on the franchise name and appeal to kids from the 80's instead of trying to put together even a decent action movie.  Just not a well thought out or well executed concept.      Very disappointing considering what the movie could have been.
B00003CXBH|5.0|A magnificent masterpiece, superb soundtrack, and a story that is truly heartbreaking.  For anyone who truly loves the cinematic experience, this is the movie that is a must see.  I am anxiously waiting to see this on BD.
B000ZK4466|2.0|I know alot of fans will want to right off this review and ignore this opinion, but this album is absoulutely awful. After hearing the single and opening track I knew it would be an album that would divide a lot of their fans. Whatever you may think about Amputechture, it is a lot better than this. Everyone seems to love Deloused and to either love or hate Frances and Amputechture, but I don't see how anyone can enjoy this. The Mars Volta is already noisy enough and this cd is all over the place and out of control. You may like that, but I don't see how it's enjoyable. I enjoy prog, but to me this is just muddled noise, and I like loud music, but I also like to hear everything. I think Amputechture was a step in the right direction, minus the vocals.     I might as well talk about the vocals...their really bad. They are loaded up with effects and he now sings in a high pitched chipmunk voice. I hate to be like this but seriously how about Cedric actually sings some high notes without computerized effects? If you can't do that, then don't, because it doesn't sound good, and it doesn't showcase your talent. The guitar is good, but not as good as it was on past albums, sometimes simple is better. The drumming is really bad too, I'm suprised more people aren't talking about it. And what else is their to say? The songs are just awful, some alot worse than others. They really need to work on their songwriting. Aberinkula isn't interesting, Agadez is painful to listen to, Conjugal Burns is one of their worst songs ever. The only decent songs are Goliath and Soothsayer, and their completely pretentious. This band was once really good but not after this garbage.
0810983915|4.0|I didn't love this book like I have loved the other Wimpy Kids but I still like it a lot.  The jokes are often funny but not side splitters like the other books.  Some seem a bit more negative and mean spirited.  I got more of a sense that the jokes were on middle school kids themselves in this book.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|The movie itself is fantastic; great for all ages. And now that it's dropped in price to an incredibly reasonable, $19.99, what's not to love? It's really quite amusing to me that all the 1 star reviews were made when it first came out for pre-order and they were all just about the price. Well, I guess it just goes to show you, it's better to wait. The price almost always goes down, so stop complaining and give this movie, and it's new price, the credit it deserves.
B002NXSRX4|3.0|And yes I realize the irony in such a declaration when it comes to comparing the directors of the two loudest and most excessive action films of 2009. Even as a mindless popcorn action flick this is questionable entertainment. It certainly has enough of a rush to babysit young boys for its duration but man alive it has numerous plot, sfx and acting potholes. A zombie has more life and personality than Channing Tatum as Duke. What a sleepy, boring \\"actor\\".    For my money Sienna Miller as the Baroness is THE only reason the film is close to tolerable.     For a two-disk set, it's very light on extra features. Probably because there is not much here to praise. Plus, for a blu-ray set, the extra features were not created in HD. Lame, Paramount.     Three stars for kids...2 for adults.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|I have always loved Sting. I was raised on the Police (my mother adored them) but I have actually always preferred his solo work. His albums rarely offer up the same feelings and responses. That is why I find it rather sad that so many people complain about his vocals on 'Winter's Night.' The gravelly tenor creates the warm and cozy feeling this album gives me, as if I were back home sitting in my grandmother's warm kitchen during frigid Januaries. I love it! Hardcore, and many times even semi-core, fans tend to often throw fits when an artist changes their style in order to explore new realms. I think it is a special thing when a talented person shows they aren't limited. Besides, Sting's voice was never \\"perfect\\" anyway.<br /><br />I think this album is absolutely beautiful and it has easily become one of my favorites.
141041986X|4.0|As the title says, I really enjoyed this book. The pacing was well done (for me), and the action sequences kept me flipping the pages time and time again. Having read the Uglies series, the setting reminded me a little of that (and a bit of Brave New World, for the Capitol). Typically, I don't read post-apocalyptic books, and this was the first of Collins that I'd read, so maybe this is coming a bit out of left-field here. Also, I find it valid to note that I bought this book back when it was NOT reccommended by Stephanie Meyer, so there was no influence there. So, onwards (spoilers are littered throughout):    The concept was highly remeniscent of Battle Royale, with teens pitched against teens in a fight to the death, gladiator-style. I'm willing to forgo that since it's what the story revolves around, and I have no real problem with fights to the death, even between minors. However, I do wonder why teens were targeted? I mean, having adults kill each other would cause less production (not to mention shatter families), but why should the Capitol care? It's a small point that just sort of puzzles me. Also, it was fairly easy for me to see that the book was part of a series, and not stand-alone, since little (emphasized) subplots kept popping up (like the Avox girl).    Katniss herself I absolutely adored. She was a tough-as-nails, no nonsense character who took on the burden of taking care of her family. The fact that she took after her dad more than her mom didn't really bother me, because an older version of Prim probably wouldn't be up to snuff. Continuing, Katniss' showed that her the focal point of her life was survival. Period. End of story. Which makes sense, considering that her family's survival depended on her. No pressure, kid. On a side note, while it would've been nice to get more backstory on how her world came to be, Katniss herself doesn't seem much like a history buff, so it makes sense that we wouldn't get much of that either. I also thought it was interesting that everyone, with a few exceptions like her family, Gale, Cinna, (eventually) Haymitch, and Rue, Katniss viewed everyone else as either a threat or a tool. For me, that really enhanced her \\"survival of the fittest\\" personality.    That said, my biggest problem was not with the unlikely love story between Peeta and Katniss (but, given that no one (family aside) knew them that well, I'll let it slide) was Katniss' reaction to it. She had absolutely no romantic feeling regarding Peeta OR Gale, so the only thing I expected her to feel bad about at the end would've been guilt for leading Peeta along. Because otherwise, he was really more of a tool to help keep HER alive.    Lastly, I've also noticed some mentions of disappointment in a \\"non-conclusive\\" ending. I couldn't help hoping that Katniss' actions would bring about some change, and I aslo felt a bit cheated when things stayed the same. But then I realized that, as a single book, it was more about Katniss surviving than trying to change the world. Especially since she could care less about the Capitol.    END SPOILERS    As an easy-to-read book, I'd recommend it for people in their mid-teens for violence.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|\\"Zombieland\\", the new film starring Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as four of the few remaining humans living on planet Earth, is one of those movies that almost looks too good when you are watching the trailer. The Coming Attractions make you laugh and laugh and you suspect all of the funny bits were included to get some butts into seats. After watching the trailer, I feared the film would be a let down. There is no way it could live up to this two-minute clip reel.<br /><br />Happily, I was wrong.<br /><br />\\"Zombieland\\" begins with Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) giving us a brief recap of what has happened to this point. Short story even shorter, zombies have overrun the planet. As Columbus is one of the few remaining humans, he has developed a list of rules he uses to survive. He quickly recites the rules, such as \\"#7 Avoid Public Bathrooms\\", the rule appearing onscreen in large block letters as we watch a vignette illustrating the same rule (Mike White in an amusing cameo). We also learn that he is on his own and trying to get home, living on the hope that someone in his family might still be human. He quickly meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) when his Escalade complete with a modified cowcatcher careens through a freeway of abandoned cars, almost hitting Columbus. The two men learn they have very different purposes in life. Columbus just wants to stay alive and Tallahassee is searching for Twinkies. He simply wants to find as many Twinkies as he can, the golden snack cake, his favorite treat. The next day, they enter an abandoned supermarket and meet Witchita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, respectively) two sisters who are trying to survive. Because they are all loners, they decide to try to remain as impersonal as possible and refer to each other by the name of their hometowns. They decide to work together and make their way to the West Coast. Along the way, they make two more very memorable stops. They also kill a lot of the zombies standing in their way.<br /><br />I almost get the feeling that someone involved with this film turned on a stopwatch and mandated everything had to keep moving and the film would nor run more than 90 minutes. Generally, I sort of revel in films that allow the characters to grow and breath, provided they actually grow and breath, but \\"Zombieland\\" keeps things moving and the film benefits from this extremely fast pace. It moves so fast it doesn't have time to make mistakes, to seem slow and boring. Because everything keeps moving, you feel like you have experienced a fuller, longer, more fleshed out film.<br /><br />As soon as we meet Columbus, we are thrust into the middle of this landscape, this story, we meet these characters. The film doesn't waste time setting everything up, explaining what has been happening. We learn this later, through some remembrances and as illustrations to some of Columbus' rules.<br /><br />Because the film starts with these rules, we immediately learn two things about the story. First, zombies are running amuck. Second, Columbus is the type of guy who would be very comfortable making lists of rules. Later, we learn a little about Columbus' last and first experience with a girl and this also helps to illustrate why he is the type of guy who would go around making rules, lists, things to keep his life running smoothly and efficiently, to keep some order in his life.<br /><br />But Columbus has learned to adapt to the new world order and has become quite adept at survival. He has learned how to shoot a gun, and what to do with it (related to one of his rules) and has learned how to keep a few steps ahead of the marauding zombies.<br /><br />When he comes across Tallahassee (Harrelson), the two couldn't be more different. But this also makes them a good pair. Tallahassee is amused by Columbus and willing to give him a few pointers. And Tallahassee is so different from Columbus, the young man likes the dichotomy.<br/><br />And Tallahassee's quest, to find as many of the remaining Twinkies left on the planet is amusing and continues to provide comic relief as his search becomes more and more desperate.<br /><br />Emma Stone (\\"Superbad\\", \\"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\\") and Abigail Breslin play the two sisters who will do anything they can to stay alive and stay together. Initially, they are reluctant to open up to the two men, but they quickly realize they need their help and can provide something to the group. Wichita also realizes Columbus is extremely interested in her, constantly flirting, and she enjoys the attention.<br /><br />As they make their way across the US, they decide to make a funny, and very memorable pit stop leading to an incredibly funny extended cameo by a well-known comedian.<br /><br />\\"Zombieland\\" is a lot of fun and plays like a roller coaster ride filled with laughs and chills and thrills.g Twinkies left on the planet is amusing and continues to provide comic relief as his search becomes more and more desperate.

0385504225|1.0|I decided to read the Da Vinci Code a while back just to see what all the hubbub was about.  It was fun, fast, even made me think and overall had some pretty nice twists and turns.  However, it was not nearly as incredible as I was expecting it to be since it nearly outsold the Bible or became the new bible to some people.    That being said this follow up is probably one of the worst books I have read.  I was a sucker and already spent the money, so I had to read it to the end.   I can't even tell you how many times I shook my head while reading, out of pure disbelief of character reactions and plot points .  Honestly, the entire plot was pointless.  I mean who really cares if Masons make up a part of our Government, like that would be a surprise to anyone to find out there are secret societies in Washington.  And honestly if the Robert Langdon is suppose to be this brilliant Prof. from Harvard why is he so dumb. Why can't he make a decision and why is someone else always figuring it out first.  Actually everyone involved in this novel knows the secret already so what is the point of keeping it secret.  I could watch National Treasure one and two and enjoy it more than this book.  Sorry for the backhanded compliment National Treasure.  Man this was an awful book and the last one I ever read from Dan Brown.
B002TOJOVG|1.0|\\"Law Abiding Citizen\\", the new film starring Gerard Butler (in his third film in six months) and Jamie Foxx, is one of those films that seems to be recycled from elements from other films. It is almost as though someone said lets make a film about a father who seeks revenge, like in \\"Death Wish\\", throw in some legal maneuvers, like any John Grisham film, throw in some shots of a crazy man imprisoned in a special cell, like in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", and throw in some good old grisly torture scenes, like in so many 'torture porn' films. The mix is so new, so fresh, that it is original. It will be a huge hit.<br /><br />Yes, the mix is new, but when you take well-known elements from questionable films and simply combine them, you end up with a mess, a mess that most people will be able to spot as a recycled piece of crap and stay away from the multiplex.<br /><br />For the unlucky few that do actually go to watch this film, it will not be a pleasant experience.<br /><br />But there is an overriding thought, a glimmer of hope carrying the viewer through the experience. When even this idea is purposely discarded, you might leave the theater as upset as I was.<br /><br />Clyde Shelton (Butler) returns home one evening to his loving wife and child. There is a knock at the door and two men barge in and tie everyone up. They leave Clyde alive to watch as his wife is murdered and then raped by Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte). The two men then walk towards Clyde's daughter's room as he blacks out. A few months later, Deputy District Attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) has accepted a plea bargain from Darby who will testify against his partner for a reduced sentence of a few years in prison. Darby's partner will receive the death penalty. Clyde is enraged and can't believe the Deputy DA won't take the case to court. He saw both men and will ID them, but Rice doesn't want to take a chance on a trial that might impact his conviction rate negatively. Clyde is one very upset man Ten years later, as Darby's accomplice faces lethal injection; Rice brings his younger prot&eacute;g&eacute; to the prison to watch. But something goes wrong, horribly wrong and the man dies a painful death. A few hours later, as the police zero in on Darby (who has since been released from prison) Clyde kidnaps the criminal and takes him to one of his own warehouses. The fact that Clyde now owns a number of properties is a long, complicated part of the story. When Darby wakes up, he finds himself strapped down to a worktable with various needles in him. Clyde, wearing a mask, turns on a video recorder and begins to extract revenge. Thus begins an elaborate tale of cat and mouse as Clyde attempts to extract revenge on all of those people responsible for his wife and child's murderers going free. In other words, he begins to extract revenge on the entire legal system.<br /><br />\\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" spends a lot of time making us feel sympathetic for Clyde. And it does a good job of it, we feel sympathetic for Clyde even as he begins to extract his revenge and start killing off all of the Deputy DAs, policemen, judges, elected officials and more who he feels were responsible for the lack of punishment for the murders of his family. And the film spends a lot of time making us sort of loathe the very ground Rice walks on. Again, it does a good job of making him seem slightly good, possibly more crooked and oily than he should be. The end result seems clear. Then the filmmakers throw other elements into the mix. As the film opens, Rice's wife is pregnant and they have just moved into a new house. Ten years later, they have a beautiful daughter and a beautiful house. Surely, Clyde won't do anything to them, it would make him seem too similar to Darby and erase a lot of the sympathy we have for him. Surely, Rice will feel a little more empathetic to Clyde now that he has a girl of his own. Surely, he can relate more?<br /><br />But the film decides to buck the trend. Clydedoes in fact do something that brings some terror into the lives of Nick's daughter and wife. It isn't much, but it does open the eyes of both Nick and the viewer. Clyde means business and he doesn't care if he ruffles a few young feathers to get the message across. Unfortunately, this does serve to make him also less empathetic. It makes the story more interesting, because he is willing to go to any lengths.<br /><br />As the film proceeds, you become aware of a point where the character development stops and the story simply becomes a tale of revenge. F. Gary Gray, the director of such films as \\"The Italian Job\\" and \\"Be Cool\\" and his screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (\\"Street Kings\\", \\"The Recruit\\") seem more interested in this aspect of the story as well. Each of the executions seems designed to provide a little puzzle for Rice and his team and to illustrate the extent Clyde will go in order to extract revenge. Some of these are interesting, surprising, even a little over the top even if they seem better suited to the newest \\"Final Destination\\" film rather than a film about a mourning father extracting revenge. But they don't help to provide character development.<br /><br />And I was willing to go along for the ride. Clyde deserves revenge because he is given a really raw deal and Butler makes us believe in his pain, his remorse and his determination to get revenge. I was willing to overlook the over-the-top \\"Saw\\"-esque revenge scene and the cobbled together nature of the story. That is how successful Butler is at making us believe in his character.<br /><br />That is, I was willing to go along for the ride until the final act of the film begins to unfold. And perhaps this part of the film ruined the rest because of Foxx's inability to make us feel anything for his character, Nick Rice. Throughout the film, Rice is more than a little shady, more than a little crooked and willing to bend the rules to help his career advance. Later, after his wife and daughter receive a little threat from Clyde, he doesn't really change this very much and seems to continue along his merry path. Foxx is good at making us feel there is an underlying need for his character to get ahead, to advance to the next step in the system.<br /><br />But as the film winds down, everything we have been feeling for the two characters is supposed to change 180. And the two central characters aren't given the time or the material to make this happen. And because of this, the film fails. Miserably.<br /><br />As we left the theater, I remarked to my companion that the film's morality reflected the old gangster films of the thirties. You spend an hour or so with a gangster and learn to like him and then, because of the production code, he had to get \\"what he deserved\\" and either be arrested by the police or die. Unfortunately, this type of moral code doesn't fly with the film we have just watched and makes the entire thing seem like a waste of time.ives of Nick's daughter and wife.

B002NXSRW0|4.0|Yesterday, I received my 2 disc edition of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, and I looked over the sleeve and it looked nice and got me all excited, reminded me of the G.I. Joe days of when I was a kid watching the cartoon!  Then, I later last night put the second disc in to check out the extras! HA that was a joke!  The only extras on this 2 disc is the making of the movie, and the special effects behind the scenes thing.  Now granted those were cool, but the only real reason for the second disc is for the digital copy!  I honestly think this movie is not worth [...] at all, maybe 16.99! Big deal you get the digital copy! How many of us out there really use the digital copy? Where was the deleted and alternate scenes? Is it really coming to the point where things are going to Blu Ray and not to regular dvd which their are a heck of a lot more dvd player owners then blu ray!  I say if you are looking at this review on deciding whether to purchase the 2 disc, wait till it goes cheaper and get it!  Don't spend over 10 bucks for it! Thanks for your time I hope this helps!

1401201911|5.0|Like many other reviewers of this paperback collection, I have never been a big Superman fan (just too darn powerful). But this is awesome and I intend to buy the hardcover. A truly daring Superman deconstruction-- landing in the Ukraine instead of Smallville, raised in Stalinist Russia, etc.Alternative history at its best.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, even though it was difficult at some points to really immerse myself into the story because the acting of Hmong kids was not convincing...I am referring to Sue and Thao....would have been a perfect 5 stars if the acting was good. :-(    Aside from that a very entertaining movie with a lot of expletives and racist comments, but all the same very humorous.    Would recommend to those not offended by off color, racey (and I do mean RACEy) humor.
0575083328|3.0|Don't be afraid. There's a good solid story, some fun contrasts between E1 (presumably our Earth in a future incarnation) and E2, an alternative Earth preserved by mysterious aliens who never actually make an appearance. Despite it's very different tone from other work by Reynolds, I enjoyed this book for its quirky noir detective story, the odd mix of high and low-tech, and the character development, which is more down to earth, dare I say, cosier, than previous novels. The science is less obtrusive in this book, more a means to a storytelling end than an integral part of the plot the way it is in Revelation Space or Pushing Ice. The plot moves along at a comfortable pace, the atmosphere of alternative 1959 Paris is painted with delightful verve, and the character of Wendell Floyd, failed jazz musician and small time detective is one of Reynolds more entertaining creations.     Century Rain is a smaller, more intimate story than many of Reynolds more dramatic works, but eminently enjoyable nevertheless. Drop your preconceptions about the author and enjoy this as a lovely little stand alone romp.

B000ZELISO|2.0|Although I more or less enjoyed this latest installment in the Harry Potter film franchise, it clearly marks the final divergence of the films from their literary source material. From this point onwards the Harry Potter movies will have very little to do with the core of the Harry Potter novels.    There are a number of reasons for this, many of which can't really be blamed on anything other than the unusual circumstances under which the film series was created. Consider that the first HP film came out before the fifth of the novels had even been written. As a result some of the smaller details in that first film (and the subsequent three films) which at first glance through the pages of the book don't appear to have very much significance were, correctly (based on what the filmmakers knew at the time) cut or deleted from the films. The problem, now that the entire saga has been completed in the books, is that some of those seemingly meaningless details from the earlier books take on tremendous significance, some being absolutely vital for the correct and complete working out of the main story arc. Of course there is no way the filmmakers could have known this as even J.K. herself hadn't yet sat down and \\"discovered\\" their importance for the latter part of the tale herself.    But the overall effect on the film series is that vast swathes of the story have to either be dropped, clumsily crammed in with hasty and unconvincing supporting exposition that was missed in earlier installments, or totally changed in order to get to a suitable conclusion of the epic in its film version. In other words, the way the books conclude is now virtually impossible to accomplish with the final two films yet to come. (Think trynig to do \\"Hamlet\\" without Polonius, Ophelia or Laertes. While they might not, in and of themselves, be necessary to the action, without them how does Hamlet maneuver into the position he must occupy in the final show down with the King?)    The other disappointment at this point in the film series is that the \\"magic\\" is pretty much gone. The sense of wonder has now completely faded and magic is simply another ordinary aspect of the universe where a decidedly grim tale is occurring. In other words, watching this film (and I'm sure the final two yet to come) will be something of a trial. They are setting a tone that is unrelentingly grim, dark, depressing and, perhaps worst of all, rushed and shallow. I doubt if anyone who has never read any of the books or seen any of the other films would look at this installment and enjoy it very much. It now has the overall mood and feel of a cheesy Grade B horror flick. We tend to overlook or forgive that if we've followed every step so far, but in and of itself this latest HP is a weak, grim, sad little mish-mash that has long since left the books far behind.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|what a TERRIFIC movie!!  after the first time, i quickly bought another ticket to see the next showing!!  everything was great! i am very impressed at how dedicated mj was to performing the best show on earth.  i mean, these are just the rehearsals!!  the thriller part was AWESOME!!! they don't care about us was AWESOME!!!  michael's voice was superb!!  he still had it!!  so you can imagine my excitement browsing on amazon that the dvd was avail. for pre-order!!!  i still can't believe it!!  and i can't wait for my next viewing of this is it next week!! i loved every second of it and really feel that this film shows the real mj.  he seemed like such a nice person to everyone and still was serious about hard work. no doubt his concerts would've rocked this planet!!

B00102FELM|5.0|The whole concert is awesome. The guests, Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell are a treat specially when Roth joins Mathias and Rudy in their classics.  Michael is a little tame, but it is always great to see him join his brother. I highly recommend this DVD to hardcore Scorpions fans, specially if you've been listening to these guys since the late 70's. Rudy and Mathias look good and sound great, and of course the man behind the microphone...Klaus Meine still has a great voice.
B0024RID6U|3.0|Hey, in 2009 no one, including this reviewer, NEEDS to comment on the fact that The Rolling Stones, pound for pound, have over forty plus years earned their place as the number one band in the rock `n' roll pantheon. Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from the tail end of their most creative period , moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the \\"golden era\\" of the Stone Age. The album, however, is a little uneven in spots reflecting, I think, a certain exhaustion of material that they could call their totally their own unless the time when they owned a big chunk of rock 'n'roll in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The age of a more sedate music (at least technically) was approaching and I think there was some confusion about whether to embrace it or \\"spoof\\" it. Still the \\"Start Me Up' track, a staple of their live concerts and a great way to rev up the 1960s aging children is a Stones \\"greatest hits\\" \\" number, right? \\"Worried About You\\" and \\"No Use In Crying\\" are stick outs in this CD. I do not think anything else here qualifies for their \\"greatest hits\\" vault.

B00005AG7K|1.0|Have to agree with all the other comments about pirated copy. Good to have for historical value, but this is a washed out, low quality bootleg. The cover artwork is one step above old style computer pixelation and the label for the DVD is obviously semi-homemade.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is the only way to get this film (for the moment) as the general consensus regarding MMT is that it is a substandard product from the Beatles.<br /><br />Of course with the benefit of hindsight, its experimentation and sheer weirdness redeems it somewhat, I doubt we'll see any major remastering of this for some time. Buy this only if you're having a Magical Mystery Tour Ultra Fan Party and need a main attraction.
0060755598|5.0|I am a firm believer that if I can spend $20-$30 at a bar on a Friday night, I can spend the same on something of value and educational.  This book is a must read for those looking to start or have just started their own business.  Very easy read, story like, with key concepts and tools that you can walk away with to begin implementing.  If you spend the $25 on this book and it increases your profits even by $25 a month... is it worth it?  If the techniques are implemented, there really shouldn't be a limit on how much you will profit from it.  I am in the process of starting up my own business and am using this book as one of many references.  Good luck!!!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Thank God he is shown as he should be ...Michael was a music genius and this movie captures that essence of him and show him at his best.  If only the noise around him could stop and watch what he really was about!  this movie is a witness of it all!    In the end Michael won! So did the ones who witnessed his last few months! Cheers to you guys to give us back a part of it in a movie...and love to his kids who will without a question represent everything about this amazing man!!!!

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an excellent workout video.  Jillian has structured the workout so that it is good for anyone.  It doesn't matter if you are just starting to work out or if you are an avid exercise fan .. there is a workout on this video to accommodate you!  The description indicates there are 3 levels. However Jillian has 2 assistants with her on each level.  One of the assistants does modified movements for those just starting the level and the 2nd assistant does the full workout without any modifications. So you are actually getting instruction on 6 different levels.      If you only buy one workout video .. but this one.
0547258305|5.0|I absolutely consumed this book. It is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read.<br /><br />Katsa is one of the Graced, those with differing supernatural powers and abilities in one area. It can be anything from cooking exceptionally well to Graces such as Katsa's, killing.  The one thing that all Gracelings share is eyes of two different colors.<br /><br />Ever since accidentally killing her adult cousin at eight years old, she has been the King's hitman and strong-arm.  She is made to think of herself as nothing more than a killer. No emotions, no feelings, no brains. Her uncle, the king, has made sure it is so. When a secret rescue mission grants her a first encounter with Prince Po, everything she thought she knew about herself, begins to change.<br /><br />Watching Katsa evolve as a character as she discover's her humanity was amazing. She starts as nothing more than a leashed attack dog for her uncle, King Randa.  As she meets and spends time with Po, she becomes more and more human. She is such a strong, fierce female character that we don't see much of in many recent novels.  It isn't a pretense for her, or in any way an attempt to gain advantage.  It is just who she is.  There is no Bella Swan in need of rescuing in this book.<br /><br />Po is an equally rich character. Also Graced, he is the first true match in a physical fight for Katsa. Even with his Grace, he is still unable to beat her. What struck me was how he was okay with it and even seemed proud of her.  He doesn't take the stance of many male characters and want to change or be the strong one in the relationship, and yet he doesn't come off as wimpy or effeminate.  Cashore has done a marvelous job writing both characters.  They both have so much depth and fullness.<br /><br />Po and Katsa's journey to find out about secrets surrounding his grandfather's kidnapping is exciting and full adventure.  Along the way there are wolves, mountain lions, treacherous weather, princesses in need of rescue, murder, and people who aren't what they seem.<br /><br />I knew this book would be good, but I was still shocked at quite how much I loved it.<br /><br />I immediately went out and bought Fire, the prequel-ish companion novel. I have been told you do not have to read either book to enjoy the other.  I can't wait to dive right in to it!<br /><br />~Jennthey seem.

I like Zafón's style of writing. For a person like me who is teaching herself Spanish, his writing is very straightforward, and his choice of words good for me.  The story so far is interesting, mysterious, and already a bit on the weird, supernatural side. I like it!

0547258305|4.0|Katsa is \\"graced\\" with the ability to kill with her bare hands. Since she is a Graceling, and also because her parents aren't alive, she is under the rule of her uncle, the king, who uses her Grace to get what he wants, even though Katsa can't bear hurting innocent people (especially for her power hungry uncle). Katsa has formed a secret council to use her Grace to help and do good things. At one of these secret missions, she meets Po, a man from another kingdom who is also Graced (I don't want to say with what as I was very surprised when I found out!) Long story short, the two become great friends and eventually fall in love. When the two of them go on a mission, things become interesting. They encounter a lot more than they thought they would. After this point, I definitely couldn't put the book down. I was a little disappointed when Katsa kept refusing to get married, but a REAL valid reason was never really given, or maybe I just missed that part?? and at the beginning, I was getting confused with all the kingdoms and kings and cities, etc. But overall, I loved this book and I can't wait to read the sequel, although I've heard it has nothing to do with Katsa....
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I love this film and have seen it many times.  Not only has it stood the test of time, it actually improves with repeated viewings.  The first few times you see it, you're so swept up in the non-stop action and the plot twists that you may not fully appreciate the imagery of the perfectly composed scenes and the powerful score that adds so much. The acting, the screenplay, and iconic scenes like the crop duster attack and the chase on Mt. Rushmore all combine to make this a great movie. It's not only one of my favorite Hitchcock films, it's one of my favorite films of all times by any director.  It's the first Hitchcock film to be issued as a Blu-Ray, so news of its release caused a great deal of interest among fans.  The initial reviews gave the Blu-Ray transfer high marks, and I'm pleased to report that the positive reviews are accurate. The remastering was done with great care and with impressive results.      The video corrects the orange skin tones that characterized the earlier standard definition DVD as well as eliminating virtually all dust, scratches, and other surface defects.  Especially when you consider that this film is 50 years old, the high-def transfer is very effective at revealing details and adding a greatly improved sense of depth and dimensionality.      The audio is also excellent, with the soundtrack coming alive in a way that it never has before.  The original mono source isn't overly processed, but instead elements are highlighted in a way that opens up the sound.  Bernard Herrmann's score is such an integral part of the film that it's good to hear it more fully.      There's a very good set of extras, two of them new for this release.  My favorite is \\"'North by Northest': One For The Ages\\", which features five directors commenting on the film as scenes are shown.  It's like a video version of an audio commentary and much more effective and interesting than hearing disembodied voices while watching an entire film.      The disc comes as a Blu-Ray book and the booklet is well done, with a lot of pictures and several short essays.  For those who love this film, the Blu-Ray is essential, and if you've never seen it, you'll definitely want to see the Blu-Ray instead of the DVD.  Highly recommended!
B001IF266C|4.0|I already had the standard version, but the DVD sounded interesting, so I decided to sell my copy and buy it again. Unlike the previous Supernature Special Edition, there are no extra tracks on the album, but the DVD nicely compensates for it. The videos are nice and there are some interesting live tracks, but the real treat are the TV performances. Too bad there are only two of these, but these are visually impressive and very cool to watch; I wish all TV performances were like these ones... If you still haven't got this album, this would be the version to pick. (As for the album itself, it's great stuff, provided that you don't expect another Supernature. This one has more to do with Cocteau Twins and Kate Bush than T.Rex and glam rock, as I'm sure you've already read somewhere else.)
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Surprised you all went with the CD versus the CD/DVD.... the CD is excellent but the DVD concert is Awesome! it was filmed in Australia, she sings AC/DC, Zepplin, Queen as well as her favorites!  whether you are a fan or not you should check out the concert one of the best shows!

I had never read one of his books before and he has won an \\"instant fan.\\" I was not able to put this book down except to sleep (which was a bit of a task in itself!. The other reviewers have done a nice job at describing a true psychological thriller that left me with my jaw open at the end of the book. The lead character is brilliantly painted and not with broad strokes. Plotting is excellent the story is utterly believable especially when thinking about it from the last page...back to the beginning.<br /><br />Pick up Shutter Island.

0316096199|5.0|This is a wholly absorbing memoir by Alice Sebold. It begins with her last day of Freshman year at Syracuse University.  It was that day that she was brutally raped in a tunnel near campus.  I started this book early in the morning and finished five hours later, with a cold cup of coffee in front of me not having moved at all.  I was so transfixed by the brutality of the event that changed Sebold's life and the brutal honesty of her writing I was incapable of doing anything else.  Sebold is able to go on after that day and we wonder how. Her life though is permanently changed from before the rape to after the rape.  She eventually goes to trial only to relive the whole brutal incident in painstaking detail when questioned by the defense attorny. It is especially hard to read after knowing what happened in that tunnel. Her attempts at coping involve \\"getting back to normal\\" which means returning to campus, dating boys, doing schoolwork and making friends and holding her breath each time to see if she is merely the \\"girl who was raped\\" or if she is really just Alice Sebold.  This is a heavy burden for any person to carry and as Sebold writes about her family we realize she doesn't have the support system to cope with the emotions that need to come out for her to heal.  Only once is she allowed to express the rage she feels when a poetry teacher encourages her to write about the experience.  Even Alice is dumbfounded at the outpouring of rage and at the mixed reaction and uncomfortable feelings the students express when the poem is shared.  In a gut wrenching turn of events her roomate is brutally raped.  This alone is terrible in and of itself but once again brings all the pain to the surface.  Alice finds herself needing to connect with her roomate to prove that she can be \\"ok\\" just like she was.  Eventually Sebold seems to settle with the uneasy truth that you can \\"live in a world where the two truths coexist; where both hell and hope lie in the palm of your hand.\\"  An engrossing memoir that you won't soon forget.An engrossing memoir that you won't soon forget.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This science fiction movie is one of the top five made in the 1950's and is even superior to the original \\"War of the Worlds\\" made in the 1950's. The story is truly a superior work as the events portrayed are possible in theory.
0156012197|1.0|As this is my all-time favorite book, I have read (and own) several copies of this book. I was excited to see this newest edition until I picked it up and read it. This is a direct translation from the original French and that kills a lot of the beauty of this piece. My advice is to buy a copy translated by Katherine Woods. This is the translation that was originally published in English and is just beautiful.
B00005JMAH|4.0|They definitely picked up the pacing with this one! In Harry's third year, a deranged murderer escapes Azkaban and is on the hunt for the young wizard. The writers for this one and the director really trimmed the fat of the story and just focused on Harry and the hunt for Black. We quickly get through the Dursleys and the Leaky Cauldron scenes and after thirty minutes we're on the Hogwarts Express. Not even the first two had us on the train after thirty minutes. The cast continues to mature and add depth to the roles and continue to get better. Michael Gambon joins the cast as Dumbledore, replacing Richard Harris and in my opinion is the better Dumbledore, especially now in the recent two where the character's more involved in the action. And he has good comedic timing. Gary Oldman is perfect as Sirius Black, but he's not in the movie enough, in my opinion, to really bring an impact to the character. David Thewlis portrays Lupin as a caring teacher with a dark secret and Emma Thompson is great as the looney Prof. Trelawny. There's a little more tension and action in this one and John Williams score is a great upgrade from the rather drab music of the first two installments.

1588167461|4.0|This small book is jam-packed with valuable information regarding men's stylings and fashion. The size lends well to a portable reference book, while the density of info makes it well for the personal library. The variety of topics covered is exhaustive, with included details on form and functions. Compared to other style books, I would say this has the most longevity. The only problem I had with it was the pictures are all black and white, and tiny. Details referred from the text are lost in the small photos. But still, highly recommended.

B002NOAF9W|5.0|THIS is what the record industry can do when it does things right.  I don't even know where to start gushing...<br /><br />Yes, this is not the first version of this album I've owned, but it most certainly is the best.<br /><br />THE MATERIAL:  No need to rehash the finer points of the classic album.  For my money, they could have swapped out a few of the cuts on the classic album and instead could have used some of the outtakes on the 2nd disc here.  In fact, Satisfaction and Under My Thumb in particular might have livened the original album up, since it (sacrilege I know) can drag a bit in the middle.  The version of Under My Thumb here is much looser and \\"groovier\\" -- Nothing like the coke-fueled full-throttle version of the song that would appear about a dozen years later as the opening track of the Still Life live LP.<br /><br />THE SOUND:  The sound here is different than the 2002 SACD hybrid.  On the '02 disc, the sound is more direct, impactful, up close -- like they plugged right into the mixing board.  This release has just as much fidelity, but is more like they hung a microphone about 15 rows back in the audience.  I have no idea if this new set uses the same masters, but the crowd noise here isn't just a wall of fans.  You can make out individual voices.  I.E. The woman who says \\"Paint It, Black, you devil\\" right before Sympathy for the Devil is now a lot more prominent than on earlier versions of this album.  Were the producers of this release were trying to get more of a \\"live\\" feel?<br /><br />EXTRAS:  The hardcover book really is a treat...especially the photos.  The shot of the boys rehearsing in a grubby basement is priceless.  A nice touch is the fan vignettes as well -- check out the short story by the guy who caught Charlie's drum stick.  One quibble, which has been repeated by others here -- the outtakes from the original album and the sets by BB King and Ike & Tina Turner could have easily fit on one disc, or they could have put the outtakes on the main disc. This is not to say the bonus tracks should be considered afterthoughts -- this is SMOKING HOT material that stands on its own, especially the BB King set.<br /><br />PACKAGING:  An optimal size.  Not a huge unwieldy 12\\" LP size like early 90's box set packaging, but not a little CD-sized ashtray either.  The card stock is nice and meaty and will withstand the inevitable lots of handling.  The graphics are also cleaned up as well - you can actually make out Charlie's face and see the differences between Keith's and Mick Taylor's guitars on the cover.  Another nice touch - the bit of ribbon they put under the CD so you don't have to resort to the pulling and pushing so often required to excavate discs out of their roost in all too many box sets.<br /><br />Overall, a multimedia tour de force.

0307454541|4.0|I don't usally read murder mysteries, but I very much enjoyed reading this one.  The only thing is in the beginning he throws so many names at you and they are Swedish names so that was even more difficult to keep track of.  But as the story picks up you get more in to the caracters and really start enjoying the book.  I highly recommend the book and don't give up if you get confused with the characters it all eventually falls in to place.
0385504225|2.0|As I was on the plane reading this book, I wanted to throw it at someone. While somewhat interesting, it was too long...and many passages were completely unnecessary. I just wanted it to end, and thought the ending would be interesting, but it really wasn't. Also the only single interesting plot turn (Mal'akh) was so predictable. I thought Dan Brown was known for his brilliant writing and keeping you on the edge of each page. I was at the edge of my limit during this read. I would not recommend it to anyone. I was very excited when this came out, but it was quite a let down. The only reason I give it two stars is because I still love a Robert Langdon book, and was envisioning Tom Hanks throughout.
B000002WPI|5.0|Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) is a classic hip-hop release that continues to stand the test of time.  Every track is a banger, and the Wu-Tang intensity never lets up for a moment.  If you don't own this album, you need to add this to your collection immediately!
0439023491|2.0|While part of me is still reeling from the cliffhanger presented at the conclusion of this book, another, quite larger, part of me really strongly questions if this book was necessary. What couldn't have been accomplished through a few quick whispers strategically placed in the woods, in conversation with Bonnie, Twill, and a quick jump to the final chapter? I'm dwelling on so much of the pointlessness of everything but the last chapter. More irritating than everything else was the Quarter Quell, a seemingly desperate plot device only created to echo exactly what had happened in The Hunger Games. REPETITIVE MUCH? I got extraordinarily irritated when I even thought of the idea that it might happen again, and was disappointed beyond words when it actually became reality. I expected this book to be all about political rebellion, and I don't see why that wouldn't have been the natural continuation--but no, the wait continues for what will actually be interesting and necessary backstory, plot that will be fresh and fun to read. I am dying to know about District 13. That is really all I am desperately waiting for. Other than all that, I'm irritated by the love triangle that keeps being played out--I feel like Collins is riding the wave from Stephenie Meyer's infamous Edward-Bella-Jacob triangle hype, and that is an unappealing idea. Just choose. Everything about this book was just infinitely dragged out, and I found it to be a pretty pathetic excuse for plot. Answers, please.<br /><br />Rating: 2/5

1594488878|2.0|I most enjoy books that ask a meaningful question in the beginning and thoughtfully answer that question throughout the book. I keep reading in search of the final answer.    There aren't any meaningful questions or answers here. The central character is Tucker Crowe, fifty-five, singer-songwriter, who had a few years of modest success before producing a semi-hit album in 1986. Just after this album's release, Tucker dropped out for twenty years. This book is set after this two decades of sloth. During this time, he apparently lived mostly off the generosity of his children's mothers; Tucker has five children by four women. He has shown little or no interest in his children through the years, with one exception.     Another character is Duncan, who has worshipped Tucker for twenty years, although they have never met. (For one thing, Tucker is American and Duncan lives in England.) Duncan maintains a website devoted to Tucker's big album and the mystery of Tucker's disappearance. Duncan and his cyberspace mates have in common a slavish devotion to Tucker's memory and his music. They all seem to have far too much time on their hands.    Duncan has a girlfriend, Annie, who has cohabited with him for fifteen years. As the novel begins, Annie is tired of Duncan, largely due to his obsession with Tucker. Duncan is tired of Annie. The reader grows tired of it all. Tucker meets Annie. Duncan meets Tucker. A lot of blah.    The writing is smooth, author Nick Hornby has published several books. There are a few good chuckles. But there are much better books out there for your reading enjoyment.

I was sorry to come to the end of the book.  Her portrait of her parents was astonishing to me.
0385504225|5.0|The Lost Symbol is a highly suspenseful, fast paced thriller done in a style only Dan Brown could accomplish. Dan Brown is a master of mixing fiction with fact teaching you trivial things about everyday objects and symbols.

I would recommend this to anybody who is a fan of Dan Brown, or thrillers. This book is difficult to put down.

The problem?  The title of this movie is GODZILLA.  We all know this was Emmerich and Devlin's attempt to give us an American Godzilla movie, but they fell way short of that goal.  If you want to see our big Ape-Whale in true form, go get Gojira, Godzilla 1985, vs. Biollante, or any of the 90's Godzilla movies.  Even Godzilla Final Wars is top-notch Kaiju fare.

1589944607|5.0|I origionaly played the game with a goup of friends who followed the show religiously. Not knowing anything about Battlestar Galactica, I jumpped right in and immersed myself in the game. I had a blast even though the Humans lost.     Every week the humans lost and every week we would be slighly depressed, but every week we went back and had a blast. Now that I'm deployed in Afghanisan, I ordered the game to share it with all my friends and we have so much fun playing.    The rules are easy to follow, every game is different, and you will learn to distrust everyone. Best friends start acusing each other of being Cylons and order delves into chaos pretty quickly.    Like I said, this is a fun game wether or not you have ever watched Battlestar Galactica. I recommend it though it does take a few hours to play, I garentee you'll be having so much fun you'll forget about the time.     Anyways, thats just my two cents.
159448385X|5.0|I recently had to read this novel for a Book Club in a graduate level reading class I am taking. This novel was not my first choice on the list, but I am so grateful that I had a chance to read it.   The story - not real, but as close to it as possible - takes the reader into the lives of Mariam and Laila and shows the ties they create as they deal with love, loss, domestic violence, and the unfortunate circumstances for women in Afghanistan. The themes of sacrifice and friendship are present throughout the entire novel, especially during the most shocking of scenes. This novel touched me very deeply as it opened my eyes to what life for women is like in other countries and cultures. There were times during the novel where I became so angry that I threw it across my room and did not read it for a day or so. There were times when I cried because I was so moved by the struggles the women encountered. I cannot think of another novel that I have read in the last decade that has caused me to have such genuine responses.   As mentioned, I am so grateful that I had to read this book and meet with others to discuss it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone - I think there is something in it that everyone can relate to in some way, shape, or form. Kudos to the author, and thank you.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. This was gruesome and twistedly faithful to the original in spirit and effect. I totally expected to be the one tortured when watching, well I should have left my preconceived notions at the door. The acting was sharp, the plot devices made just enough sense that it never broke my disbelief and I admittedly had to briefly look away from some scenes.    The setup was stellar and the ending did not disappoint. I give it a 5 but if it was possible I would have given it more.    Good for the genre and great by comparison of other remakes.    I would definitely suggest it to anyone that enjoys the genr
B001993Y2C|4.0|I remembered how awful the original Battlestar Galactica series was and really had no interest in viewing the new series when it aired.  Oh, the original series had a great concept, but atrocious acting, horrible scripts, completely inane and laughable dialogue, along with amateurish special effects (or should I say one cheap special effect repeated ad nauseum) sunk it for me very early on.  And the only reason I tried out this new series (via Netflix) was because of all the positive reviews.  Then again, the original series also got plenty of positive reviews ... which I find impossible to even comprehend.    Let's start off with the good.  The acting ranges from decent to excellent (mostly excellent, especially James Olmos).  The special effects are indeed movie-worthy, the concept (obviously taken from the original, which I thought very highly of) has been refined and improved, while the scripts and dialogue are generally quite good, even thought provoking.  I guess the most important thing is, this series throws many curves and sometimes shocks (at least I was shocked more than once ... and I do mean shocked!).  It's certainly a far cry from the silly, cliche-ridden original, thank God.  I also liked how the new series paid homage to the original by showing the older cylon robots in a few episodes.  It cracked me up when I heard them say, \\"By your command\\".    Now the bad.  Normally, I feel a series can sustain high quality for about 2 or 3 seasons before it begins to melt into milk toast, so I wasn't surprised that this 4-year run had several episodes that were fairly mundane ... and a few that were simply weak throw-ins.  There were several times I thought I was viewing a soap opera, so it began grating on me.  I'm far from being a prude, but I began to tire of all the sex, and to the point that it simply bored me.  But the worst part of this series ended up being the Lee Adama character.  I felt it was the weakest writing in the series ... here we have a \\"hero?\\" that is an insufferable whiner that probably should have been thrown out the airlock before the second season.    While all that does sound pretty bad, the quality episodes (and that is most of the episodes) far outweigh these negatives.  This is an impressive series with some rich characters and brilliant ideas.  For science-fiction (usually considered non-science, just dumb fiction), Battlestar Galactica breaks new ground, especially for television.  And while I think the short-lived series, FIREFLY, was one of the best that this genre has to offer, in many ways I feel that Battlestar surpasses it (although FIREFLY was a heck of a lot more fun ... it had some really excellent and witty writing, and is still my favorite).    I bought the blu-ray version, so I feel I also need to rate the video and audio quality as well.  I watched this on a Samsung 40-inch LCD with an Oppo blu-ray player.  My sound system is only a 2.1 system, but high quality (a Zvox 550).  That said, here are my impressions:    Video:  Between 1 and 10, I give it a marginal 7 (barely 3-1/2 stars).  Generally, I thought the video was very good, but it does get far too grainy at times.  I understand the feeling the director wanted to convey, but this is not a series to show off stunning blu-ray quality (although there are certainly scenes that are pristine).    Audio:  Between 1 and 10, I give it a marginal 9 (or 5 stars).  Mostly excellent, especially the powerful drum work (while I certainly liked the entire score, I felt the drum beat was supremely effective in the scenes that used it, and added greatly to the suspense of the moment).  The music and sound effects resonated and helped immerse me into each scene, and some scenes, like the creaking of the ship as well as the \\"back-breaking\\" moment, totally captivated me.    The Series:  Between 1 and 10, I give this series a very solid 8 (or a high 4-star rating).  The difference between this new series and the original is like a clear, sparkling stream versus a mud puddle littered with trash.  Had the series not meandered around in several episodes, I would have gladly given it a 9 or higher (or a 5-star rating).  As it stands, I still consider this a must-see series for sci-fi fans.  I have to say that this series surprised me so much that I stopped renting after the first season and purchased the entire series.    One more note.  About the packaging.  If one thing is consistent in all these reviews, it is the complaints about the packaging.  For me, it didn't bother me.  I simply threw away the big cardboard construct and have the individual season packages on my shelf.  And while it is a bit difficult getting some of the dvds to slide out, and I would have preferred protective sleeves, it really is a non-issue for me.  What is an issue is not having a booklet that describes what is on each dvd.  It's hard to understand why this was MIA.
0374531943|5.0|I picked this book up based on a recommendation in Gene Weingarten's Washington Post column.  I can't remember what Gene said exactly, but it had to do with people who were unexpectedly good writers, providing insight into important moments in history.  Which is exactly what Carry the Fire is:  a candid, funny, moving story of a bunch of \\"test pilot engineers\\" and thousands of un-named unsung heroes (including the glue-pot ladies who made sure the space suits didn't leak) managing to put two men on the moon in 1969.<br /><br />I am not a technical person, but I do like a good adventure story, and I am willing to accept the premise that I must learn a little science in order to enjoy the adventure.  Michael Collins pulled me along into the sciences of navigation, physics, geology, etc. all with the goal of getting to the moon, and I was happy to be along for the ride.<br /><br />He claims to be a non-emotional kind of guy, which makes the emotions of this book all the more moving:  facing and conquering the claustrophobia attendant on being in a pressure suit, delivering the worst of all possible news to one of the Apollo I wives, contemplating the very real possibility that something would happen to strand Eagle on the moon, and he would have to return to Earth alone-- all of these episodes left me sleepless on the evenings on which I read them.<br /><br />Lastly, I will share that I am the child of one of those thousands of people who made Michael Collins' space flight possible.  I did not appreciate at the time my dad's role (or his engineering brain) which made him part of history-- I only saw a guy who went off to work at the Cape every day.  I remember the day when I arrived home from school to find him at home ahead of me-- the first time ever-- washing the car, on the edge of tears.  For many years, that remarkable scene was my primary impression of the disaster that was Apollo I-- something so catastrophic that my dad would come home from work early.  This book helps me to frame my dad's workaholism and long absences in my childhood as part of the larger mission-- one which took many men away from their families to do something almost impossible, \\"in peace for all mankind.\\"ook helps me to frame my dad's workaholism and long absences in my childhood as part of the larger mission-- one which took many men away from their families to do something almost impossible, \\"in peace for all mankind.\\"

1401323820|4.0|I loved the book.  Of course, I love Castle the tv series.  I do think that some of the dialogue was not exactly how they relate to each other on tv but it is a book that is based on the tv characters.  I think if there are other books that they will only get better and I do hope that there will be other books!
B001AVCFK6|3.0|First, I want to say that I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It was FUN.    Second, I had to ignore a lot of inaccuracy and inconsistencies with the original Star Treck Vision, Story Line, and Characters.  Lots of liberties were taken with the technologies and I had to ignore that too in order to find enjoyment in this movie.    J J Abrams is pretty good at putting together action and comedy packed fast moving dramas, but it was like he made this really tasty beef and vegetable stew without actually adding beef and vegetables.    So I say, 5 stars for Fun, but 1 star becouse it's not really Star Trek - Average 3 stars.    BR
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I have seen \\"This Is It\\" twice so far.  I went to the sold-out opening night showing and came away so impacted by the sheer genius of Michael Jackson.  It was awe-inspiring, a music and dance masterpiece, and a truly emotional experience.  The new video of his \\"Earth Song\\" couldn't help but inspire us to do our part to save the planet and make the world a better place.  The second time I went to the IMAX version and felt like I was actually there.  I heard that Michael intended for \\"Thriller\\" to be seen in IMAX 3D.  Now I have to find that theater:-)    This is a must-see film for anyone who appreciates genius and amazing music, dance, staging and film.  Everyone involved in this movie is exceptional but Michael does stand alone in his brilliance.  I do not have enough superlatives for Michael and this film.  I will now pre-order the DVD and plan to purchase some for holiday gifts.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|i see the movie, he was looking good ,not sick at all. he was a little big to skiny but that was it ,with maybe another 10 or 15 pounds more he were look like when he was in his 30'.

B000286S8S|4.0|Overall this is a great double CD and a good overview of Van Halen's music.  I feel there are a few David Lee Roth ommissions like \\"I'm the One\\", \\"Ice Cream Man\\", \\"Somebody Get Me a Doctor\\", \\"Mean Streets\\" and \\"So This Is Love?\\" among a few other personal favorites.  They could have replaced the new tracks and the live tracks with these songs.  Why does \\"Finish What Ya Started\\"  end before it's finished?  It's not even a good edit.  You can hear the next note being cut off after it started.<br /><br />I don't understand the track sequencing for this CD though.  It starts out with Eruption which is cool but then goes into 3 new songs that are good but I don't think will ever be considered hits.  I don't think the track order has to be chronoligical but because this is already a double CD I wish they would have split the CD's into a 1978 - 1984 Dave CD and a 1986 - 2004 Sammy CD.  After I downloaded the music in my computer I did my own personal track sequencing.<br /><br />1.  Hot For Teacher<br />2.  Eruption<br />3.  You Really Got Me<br />4.  And the Cradle Will Rock<br />5.  Everybody Wants Some!!<br />6.  Unchained<br />7.  Jamie's Cryin'<br />8.  Panama<br />9.  Dance the Night Away<br />10. Beautiful Girls<br />11. (Oh) Pretty Woman<br />12. Dancing In The Street<br />13. Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love<br />14. Runnin' With the Devil<br />15. I'll Wait<br />16. Jump<br /><br />1.  Finish What Ya Started<br />2.  Poundcake<br />3.  Why Can't This Be Love<br />4.  Feels So Good<br />5.  Right Now<br />6.  Best of Both Worlds<br />7.  When It's Love<br />8.  Black and Blue<br />9.  Love Walks In<br />10. Top of the World<br />11. Dreams<br />12. Can't Stop Lovin' You<br />13. Runaround<br />14. Up For Breakfast<br />15. It's About Time<br />16. Learning to See<br />17. Not Enough<br /><br />I didn't add the live tracks to my playlist but if I did I would put them at the very end.  With this track order the songs flow into each other really well and you can hear what both singers bring to the party.
B002OVEB5S|4.0|Like they said in their interview with Guitar World they are the \\"AC/DC of Thrash Metal\\" They keep it true.     I do miss the old crunch in the distortion, though,  like back in the day. You know that crunch that made thrash seem that more thrash-ier? But that's what happens when Greg Fidelman produces your music. Same happened to MetallicA.     But the album is still a great album. The riffs are great, the solo's suck so thrashingly good the drums carry the power of Thor and the lyrics pound sense into your thick, ego filled skull. It's metal up your ass greatness. Definitely a recommended buy.
0385504225|2.0|If you want to learn about the Masons, our Founding Fathers, and interesting architecture in the nation's Capitol, then search the internet or find a nonfiction book dealing with those subjects.  Don't bother with Dan Brown's book. Every time there was any action, Dan Brown stopped it with detailed information about symbols within our Capitol.  The climax was not only predictable, but Mr. Brown kept on writing.  If his goal was to bore me to tears, he succeeded admirably.  You know a book is not interesting when you only have five pages left to read but go to sleep anyway.  I was never so happy to finish a book.
