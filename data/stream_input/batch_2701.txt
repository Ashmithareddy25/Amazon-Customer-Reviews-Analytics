B004SIP6C2|5.0|The Cider House Rules is a charming tale of 1940's New England and what life was like for children in an orphanage.  Will not spoil the plot by telling the storyline, but the acting was superb and there was great chemistry of the cast.  The scenery in this delightful movie was a character itself adding to the beauty of the story telling.  A movie well done.  Beautiful musical score.  The convincing acting of Michael Caine, Toby McGuire, Charlize Theron, Erykah Badu, Jane Alexander, and Kathy Baker and others make this movie a timeless gem to revisit.  The Cider House Rules is a modern day classic.  Highly recommend.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love the game, because it is not only fun to play, but it makes you think and pay attention to the pieces. I enjoyed it very much. There is more different games than I have on my desktop computer.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|---3 stars<br />Huge waste of my time. Problems downloading the additional 615 megs, AFTER install.<br />After all that all I get is the Gameloft splash screen then crash.
B004SDEP38|3.0|The app, albeit very basic, does what I would expect of a tablet office app. However, where it falls short is the lack of Dropbox support, where most of its competitors do.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Me giving a review is extremely rare. That has to say something, doesn't it??  Five stars for a fun puzzle game!!!
B004SDSSFY|3.0|The app, albeit very basic, does what I would expect of a tablet office app. However, where it falls short is the lack of Dropbox support, where most of its competitors do.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|It's a good app for th  price but it's not as good as any chest set I've played. I'd rather  play a game on the board. It's on my kindle so it's not really movable. I'd hate to play it on my phone.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Keep's you glued to your seat and is filled with action all the way through.  I really did enjoy watching this and would recommend it to anyone else.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun escape game. Not too difficult nor too hard. Some floors have more than one room which adds to the challenge. Runs smoothly on Kindle with no glitches. Only 10 floors right now, but the price (free) is right.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the game is very fun and challenging I like playing it looking forward to more rooms hope they are soon
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I have played a lot of big fish HOS games &amp; puzzles adventure games and this one is totally different!! It all takes place in 1 place &amp; is 1 puzzle/riddle after another! It has been much harder than I expected and honestly if it wasn't for the online walkthrough I would never have gotten this far(chap.4)!!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think all games need a hint button! Maybe I'm just to dumb for these games bit I really do appreciate an in game hint instead of having to leave the game every time I get stuck!! There is a clue button and it does help but not always enough for me!! This is a great game as long as you like to use your brain!!
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is a story of how a man learned to love others. I love the characters, the pace and the quality of the movie. This is probably one of the best German movies I have ever seen.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I don't know what I expected it to be, but really was not satisfied with it. Sorry, will check closer next time.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|You know the all too familiar story: educated, cultured wife gives up legal career to stay home and play housewife to two timing, well connected, political husband when his chickens come home to roost and he's thrown in jail. What comes next makes this wife seem like a modern day saint....
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I love Final Fantasy VII, and after watching this video on YouTube, I decided that i just had to add it to my collection.  I bought my copy used, and it was in near perfect condition, but overall if you want the movie, this is a great way o get it.  i recommend this to anyone who loves the game and the movie who wants to own it for themselves.
B00D8WJ9JK|3.0|Not a bad album ...but not an amazing one either. I expected more from cole. Personally I enjoyed his mixtapes more. Everyone needs to get off the d*** and be a little more truthful!!!
B00AN1KU1K|4.0|I went to a friend's house and she had this for her daughter. My son loved it right away so we ordered one for him. I wish we had found it sooner bc my son was just starting to crawl when it arrived and shortly after was crawling out of it.<br /><br />We did bring it on vacation and it was great. We took a plane so took the air out and put it in out suitcases and blew it up at the hotel. It was nice to have in a hotel room bc it kept my son busy and in one spot.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|its amazing :D it makes me think outside the box... no pun intended of course. hes a fun cute little guy and now theres 2 of him. makes it all the more chalenging.
B00DHNBY02|4.0|I enjoyed the original setting in the film, the story left a little to be desired and I was really hoping for a Bruce Campbell appearance but did get a short glimpse of the man at the end of the credits. I still had fun with the movie and as a fan of the original films I enjoyed it. Even though there was the usual predictability but who cares. You definitely know what to expect.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game. Have told my friends about it.  Love to watch those sharks at work. I have spent hourss playing.
140123755X|5.0|I really like this spin off of clasic fairytales. It's creative, well written, intriguing, and overall a fantastic read. Like other reviewers, they get better with each volume.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|Had this movie on VHS and had to replace it.  Very romantic movie with Richard Gere and Jodie Foster. A civil war story that keeps you guessing who is Mr. Sommersby  to the very end of the movie.
B0045HCJT4|4.0|Great action scenes with an underlying story with both warm and cold human interaction.  Good film for Kurt Russel fans.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Excellent film. I had it on VHS and wanted to replace it .  The movie  is an example of a wonderful friendship and exciting story.
B00004STDN|4.0|Good story line.  Lots of great action both in and atop beautiful mountains.  Scenery is fantastic.  Lots of breath taking stunts.
0767821769|5.0|Love this movie. How can it not be great with Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon?  It shows the struggle between the first wife and<br />the new one and how it is resolved to true friendship due to illness.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|This is one of the two most important books by Ayn Rand - the other one being &#34;Atlas Shrugged.&#34; It is absolutely crucial to read and understand Ayn Rand's theory of morality. In the limitless multitude of such theories offered by every religion, conventional ethics classes, and every philosophical school, this is the only one that sounds complete and makes logical sense. Knowledge and understanding of morality is absolutely necessary for every person pursuing happiness.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My son really loves this game. Great city adventures and has excellent control. Defeinitely a great game for just a buck.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I discovered Daria a few months ago and loved watching it and quickly became my favorite show. I knew I needed it on DVD to show my friends who I know would enjoy it as much as I do. The DVD came in plastic seal brand new and I couldn't be happier with it. Thanks so much and keep up the good work!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Couldn't put it down. It is beautiful, sad, and touches your heart. This book is a must read. This author blew me away with his writing.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I brought this app to watch movies on Prime, However I have not been able to use it so far. When I watch a movie I get amazon streaming, not this app. So in that respect I don't know how it works.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love dragons so this game is perfect for me. I play on kindle and had a hard time trying to download updates until I used update instead of new spring or fairytales.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this book. I can't wait to read the last one. I love the twist and turns. Loved it, loved it!
0441013074|2.0|Reynolds is typical of so many SF writers in that he has interesting, often fascinating ideas, but his dialogue is irritating, and his notion of how humans interact is puzzling.  At times, I felt that if I read one more one-liner or quip from Floyd, the alt-earth detective/jazz musician, I'd toss the book through the window. And the lack of astonishment/incredulity on the part of Floyd as the story progresses and his situation changes drastically is a real failing on the part of the author.  It's both extremely unrealistic, and a missed opportunity to make the novel more interesting.<br /><br />And Verity, our female protagonist, presumably is supposed to come off as \\"strong\\" or something; I found her to be like so many of Reynolds other female characters: pushy, arrogant, and a little too perfect.  (On a side note, what is it with male SF writers and their adoration/worship of their female characters?  Aren't females flawed too?)<br /><br />And the references to Casablanca...just lame.  Toward the end, I found myself skipping ahead to see how it would all come out, but I didn't really care very much.
B004G600A4|5.0|My daughter had seen this movie once and wanted to own it.  She has watched it multiple times since it was purchased from Amazon.  Thank you.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|We love this type of film.  It captured our imagination and was believable in it's unreality.  Awesome.  We were captured unblinking for the whole film.  The world dropped away around us and we were truly entertained.  This doesn't happen much these days, so it was nice.  Kirsten Dunst isn't my favorite, but she was so different in this - it didn't even look like her.  I liked that.
1612680011|4.0|Have only heard great things about this book.  I look forward to reading it and sharing it with others. Great price and quality
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|The movie started out great then stopped. wouldn't play, this vender was very good and took the movie right back no questions asked and refunded my money.  I would buy from her again no problem!  Thanks!
B00005KARK|4.0|Never saw the movie and loved it.  It brought to life some great childhood memories. Disney does make great movies.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Building the reef is fun for a while then you either have to be very patient or spend real money to be able to buy pearls to advance. As you get into the higher levels you must have a lot of algae and money stockpiled to keep advancing. Also at the higher levels (20+) the game tends to crash the kindle frequently to the point that you have to do frequent reboots. Very frustrating especially if you are playing it with a child or the child is trying to play it. One other note is that there are no guides with the game. To learn it's either try and wing it or spend the time looking up info on the Internet to figure it out.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Loved the CD...the sound is excellent and the videos are great. I recommend this sound track..My friends enjoy watching these videos at my bar.
B002WJI66C|4.0|My son likes boo a lot.  This is a very fun toy.  Difficult to keep clean... but lots of play fun.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I bought this album because I've enjoyed all of Daft Punk's previous works. I like their EDM/disco feel. This album is different from their others, though. In my opinion, at least. It delves more heavily into the disco part of EDM's roots, but still with that Daft Punk touch. It's a good, solid album, with &#34;Get Lucky&#34; as one incredibly catchy highlight. Heck, if a person still had to buy an entire album for a song, I would still recommend buying this just for &#34;Get Lucky&#34;.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|So entertaining! They had so much fun interaction between the super heroes that it made this a lot of fun to watch.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|My son got me started watching this show.  I love any kind of show with supernatural in it.  So, when we started watching it together, I was hooked.
B0049U4INC|5.0|To be simple and true. I couldn't be more pleased worth the purchase of this book. I would do it again 100 times.
B003L77GGK|5.0|My son got me hooked on Supernatural.  He started watching it when he was away at college.  I love this show, and we watch it together when ever we get the chance.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|Ex PDF reader was ok but I expected a lot more from it. I have annotate for my iPad, that works great. Thought it was going to be a lot like it for my kindle and I was wrong. Not very user friendly.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|My son got me started watching this show.  I love any kind of show with supernatural in it.  So, when we started watching it together, I was hooked.

B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I got this for my grand kids, and they absolutely love it.  They could spend hours just playing and drawing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app makes it so easy to use pinterest and I can see much more from the app than the website. love it! the only problem I have is that it is so addicting!! still really enjoy using this app probably one of the most used apps I own.

0062280228|3.0|I thought this was going to be more of a young boy's loss-of-innocence story but it was more fairy-tale/magic/horror/fantasy than I care for. Not my cup of tea - but others have clearly loved it.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|We knew this film received decent reviews and was not disappointed. Enough twists and turns to keep interest up to the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is beautifully casted. I cant wait for the next season as it left me on the edge of my seat.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a neat game. No bugs. Awaiting the sequel! It felt a little short but well worth the 1.99.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me because he knew I loved giant robots old anime and video games. It's a great read.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I read this book (and in honesty read the other two books available in this series) twice in one week because i loved it so much. Usually the girls in books like these need to be saved and throw themselves at anyone that would, but the heroine in this book is going down kicking and screaming, to the point you almost want to smack your forehead and tell her to ask for help. Sometimes it sucks to be smart.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I had the other one of this game and I deleted it for this one and it was awful we couldnt play it with out it freezing or glitching out deleted it off my device one week after I got it
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Excellent first season. Looking forward to the next season! The acting is superb...especially Kevin Spacey Robin Wright.<br />Watched as many as 3 episodes at a time.
B00BB22GQM|4.0|If you like VW, you'll like this album.  Good for a third album, if not as great as their freshman and sophomore efforts.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well, this game is absolutely, amazing. The only thing bad about it is how addicting it is!! This game.is awesome and highly recommended from me!
B001R4MEUM|4.0|This is Peter Gabriel era Genesis at its finest, widely varied musical styles, beautiful lyrics, all woven into an interesting long story.  More polished and fluid than earlier efforts like Foxtrot and Nursery Crime, and far less commercial than the band when Phil Collins took over as front man.  Musically quite interesting, varied time signatures and genres.  I recommend it highly.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Cool a really good warrior game I've played really good one before and this one is one of the best
B001EC2J20|5.0|As our lives here on planet earth get weirder every day with all sorts of newly rediscovered truths from humanities pasts emerging all the time, the idea that our world is much like this fictional &#34;Matrix&#34; seems more and more likely. The movie forces you the viewer to expand your mind along with the main character to see beyond what seems real and how it can be manipulated.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and hard and the little yellow people on the game are very and funny for kids that like the movie they might like this game
B001EBWITA|5.0|This movie forces the viewer to look at the possibility of the existence of creatures so often read about in religious texts and blamed for influencing man's negative behavior yet amusingly enough denied by those who claim to believe in those same texts. The &#34;balance&#34; spoken of in this fictional work is interesting to witness as the characters on both sides of good and evil play with man. great special effect. Satan is wonderfully creepy and the arch angel Gabriel is more human than not. Reeves as usual delivers.
B004SDEP38|1.0|such a bad app so useless do not get this it is very bad and you will be wasting your time
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|My two of my favorite actors make this movie great.The love story with a time twist is unique and although this movie lacks the sex, violence, and smut of typical movies, it it is a testament to real writing and acting and doesn't need that other filler to complete it.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|such a bad a[[ it is useless I hate it do not buy this it is very bad and dont get it

B0018AZWTA|5.0|Yes' Drama, or Yes Meets the Buggles, has been getting a lot of play by me lately. I was into Yes back in the 80s after 90125 came out and I discovered their earlier catalog like Fragile and The Yes Album, but for some reason never picked up Drama. As the one album that Yes did with vocalist Trevor Horn of the Buggles (along with his partner Geoff Downes on keyboards) it provides and interesting bridge between the early 70s Yes sound and their post-1983 sound following Trevor Rabin's entry into the band. I know a lot of Yes fans from the early years didn't care for Drama, but if you became a fan in the 80s you should give it a listen.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dex has gone back to the days of the first few seasons. Action, suspense, and  intrigue.<br />Good stuff. If you liked him at the beginning, you will love him now.

038533348X|5.0|The English political philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) wrote in his seminal work Leviathan (1651), \\"The life of man [is] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\" Kurt Vonnegut must have read Leviathan, for in Cat's Cradle he writes: \\"The history of all mankind is the history of ignorance, viciousness, and stupidity.\\"<br /><br />The unnamed narrator of Cat's Cradle sets out to write a book entitled The Day the World Ended, in which he plans to chronicle the life and work of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the inventors of the atomic bomb. Hoenikker has created an even more deadly device, ice-nine, which can transform all the world's water--its wells, ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans--into solid ice, an apocalypse of cataclysmic proportions.<br /><br />Shortly before Hoenikker's death, the (mad?) doctor gives vials of ice-nine to his three children. The fate of the Earth trembles in the (necessary) balance of good and evil.<br /><br />Traveling to the Republic of San Lorenzo, a little island in the Caribbean, the narrator (who says \\"I was a Christian then. I am a Bokononist now.\\") becomes a disciple of an elderly black man called Bokonon. The island's outlawed \\"holy man,\\" Bokonon is the author of the banned Books of Bokonon, which states \\"All religions are lies.\\"<br /><br />Bokonon realizes that truth (especially the truth of science) has failed and has made possible the end of mankind. The first sentence in The Book of Bokonon asserts: \\"All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.\\" The title page of The First Book of Bokonon issues this warning: \\"Don't be a fool! Close this book at once! It is nothing but foma [lies].\\" Thus, \\"The cruel paradox of Bokononist thought [is] the necessity of lying about reality, and the heartbreaking impossibility of lying about it.\\"<br /><br />Kurt Vonnegut (1922-2007) has been described by critics as \\"America's greatest satirist,\\" \\"our finest black humorist,\\" and \\"a laughing prophet of doom.\\" He admitted to being a pessimist, but denied being a nihilist. He certainly is pessimistic in Cat's Cradle, implying our lives and the universe are like the child's string figure: \\"No cat and no cradle.\\"<br /><br />Vonnegut once graded his own novels. He stated that \\"the grades do not place me in literary history\\" and that he was comparing \\"myself with myself.\\" He gave an A-plus to only two of them: Slaughterhouse Five and Cat's Cradle. Cat's Cradle is a sad and disturbing book, but the A-plus rating is not exaggerated.<br /><br />Cat's Cradle, published in 1963 during the Vietnam conflict, is a powerful protest specifically against the stupidity  of that war, and indeed of wars in general. Was Vonnegut prescient about a chilling future scenario in which all life on planet Earth is destroyed?<br /><br />Robert Frost wrote:<br />Some say the world will end in fire,<br />Some say in ice.<br />From what I've tasted of desire,<br />I hold with those who favor fire.<br />But if I had to perish twice,<br />I think I know enough of hate<br />To say that for destruction<br />ice Is also great<br />And would suffice.\\"
0452289963|5.0|I like how the arthor used so much passion in his words. He took me through the journey from beginning to end. I always reference the book whenever I'm having a uncertain day. He knows how to put his readers in the present moment. He touch on every subject.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Beauty And The Beast is a Disney animated film from 1991. It is known as one of the best animated films of all time, and it is one of the only animated films to be nominated for the ''Best Picture'' Oscar.<br /><br />The film is about a beautiful young woman named Belle who lives in France. She loves to read, and the townspeople find her beautiful, but strange. Her father is an inventor, and when he manages to make his new machine work, he sets off to a fair, only to get lost and become attacked by wolves. He comes across a big castle where a beast lives. The beast confronts him, and keeps him prisoner.<br /><br />While this is happening, a cruel man in the town named Gaston wants Belle to marry him, only for him to get refused and humiliated in public. When Belle finds out her father is in trouble, she sets off to find him. When she reaches the castle, she begs the beast to free him, but the beast only will if she promises to stay in the castle forever. She gives him her word, and he lets her father go back to the village.<br /><br />Beast is a hothead and a bully, but he is also really shy and sad. We learn that he was transformed into a beast by an enchantress, and he must learn to love someone before his 21st birthday, otherwise he will remain a beast forever.<br /><br />This is a really amazing movie. The animation is beautiful, dark, and scary. When I was a kid, I actually had nightmares because of some scenes from the film. It's a really good and mature film, and the songs are extremely catchy and really funny. A superb animated film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|so I'm a girl, of course Livelys Reviews here&hellip; anyways this is like the best&hellip; although I cant seem to find the lite addition for my kindle&hellip; I like to compare things anyways this is a GREAT WAY TO BE IMAGINIATIVE AND A MURDERER AT THE SAME TIME!!!!<br /><br />XOXO LIVELY
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The Lion King is a great Disney film. It has a plot similar to Hamlet, and also features similarities to the anime called ''Kimba The White Lion''.<br /><br />The film has a great storyline, likable characters, and a mean villain. The animation is colorful, and the film has some of the catchiest songs in Disney history. This is a super good movie that anyone can love.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids love this game similar to temple run, just a little more  kid friendly. Great for ages 4 &amp; up
B009MO57H6|4.0|Resident Evil: Retribution is an action film based on the video game series ''Resident Evil'' by Capcom. It is the 5th movie in the series.<br /><br />One of the things I love about this movie is that it features many characters from the games. Ada Wong, Leon Kennedy, Barry Burton, and Jill Valentine. The film has non-stop action and it is really well made, but I found the ending was kinda silly. Other than that, I enjoyed the film and I loved the action a lot.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great challenges. Always something new, looking forward to more games with new room designs. Fun alternative to the usual games that everyone else is playing.
1427210241|5.0|A really well put together ending.  There are plenty of what ifs and I wonder what will happen to this character, but in a good way, not in a frustrating way - an ending with a future.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Superbly cast, acted and above all, performed.  The stars have made an historic operatic archive which will be a hard act to follow.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This is one of my Husband's favorite films.  Definitely a great movie. We absolutely love watching it in Blu-ray format.

159463176X|2.0|I had not read the first two books by this author, but I had heard a lot of good things about both of them.  So when this new book came out, I decided to read it.  The story takes place over a period of about 60 years.  In and of itself, this is not a bad thing but it skipped back and forth in time with new characters added, some of which had nothing or very little to do with the main story.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the story was rather disjointed by the way it skipped around and had so many characters that it was confusing and hard to follow.  If this is an example of this author's writing, I certainly do not want to read anything else he writes or has written.  With about 125 pages left, I came very close to tossing the book and not finishing it.  There was an entire chapter introducing new characters that I felt had nothing to do with the basic storyline or the main characters.  I did, however, continue reading and finished the book only to find an unhappy and anticlimatic ending.  I am very sorry that I spent the time and the money on this novel.  I'm not sure what all the hype is regarding this author and this book and I wonder why it remains on the best seller's list.  Sometimes when I finish a book I am sad and I miss the characters, but not with this book.  I say \\"good riddance\\" and I'm glad I'm finished so I can read something more enjoyable.
B003TH14H4|5.0|This show its much better than all those other crime shows. Castle uses mystery and subtly humor to enhance this show.
0671015206|5.0|This was a great book.<br /><br /> It was nice to hear about how actual millionaires think and live.<br /><br />Also, how it's not all about what you see on television.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I got my cd in no time. It sound great and enjoy the new band they have. Alice kick a##
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome read! I can see why the series is so popular. Definitely looking forward to the final book.<br /><br />Will read everything she writes.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I waited for years and finally purchased this movie and it is wonderful, terrific.  I can see why it is still on Broadway.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great story of friendship, rebirth and the possibility of starting anew even out of the ashes of despair.  Great Book!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|These videos are absolutely  amazing in every way. Their quality is amazing , and I love them and highly recommend them to all potterheads out there
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was very entertaining. It makes you think but in the end you have a feeling of accomplishment. If you like to challenge yourself to solve puzzles this is the game for you. It is rather short but it's completely worth it.
1439102813|5.0|I will never look at this disease the same way again. The author made me aware of the trials and challenges faced by those with Alzheimer's disease. I will be more compassionate and aware of what the individual is feeling.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|i love this cd and im glad i download it glad i order it. thank you soo much. thank you
B0091REZMW|3.0|App is confusing if you are just looking for a hidden object game.  Want money to really advance otherwise you're just exploring the same rooms over and over again.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I was in the high twentys came home one day and everything was deleted spent a good bit of money on this games as well very disappointed
0679809015|2.0|The book is only 3&#34; or so tall. It is a very small book. The story is. Very simple and plain, nothing clever or rhyming.  The flaps are like cardstock, but i don't know how long they will last. I can see wear making them very flimsy and worn.  My toddler will need to be very careful not to rip them. I don't think i would buy this book again if i had known these things. Now that we have it we will enjoy it, but i feel a lot of other choices would have been better.
0553801473|5.0|Exactly what he wanted and we couldn't find it anywhere. Thank you so much:) he said it was perfect. :)
0425266060|5.0|This series truly captured me. It kept me awake for days on end but I didnt mind at all. I truly became endured to these characters and I felt like they were real and a part of me. I had to remind myself that it is fiction. Sylvia does an outstanding job of making you feel like you are there and making it all feel real. It was passionate, fast paced and the most erotic thing I ever read. It really causes a physical reaction that no one could deny. I will be re-reading this series over and over and over again. I dont even want to lend it out. I am OBSESSED, POSSESSED AND I WOULD NOT CHANGE IT FOR THE WORLD! Thank you Sylvia!!!!
B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|I took the risk to buy one of these machines for testing in digital signage. It is important to note that you need to buy the RAM, mSATA drive and Clover or \\"Mickey Mouse\\" cable. Luckily I saw what other buyers got and the packaging also states this.<br /><br />The computer is surprising for its size and it's well built, heavy and sturdy. It is necessary to remove the bottom cover to install the mSATA drive and RAM (it has two memory slots). Includes a metal plate to be installed in the rear of televisions and monitors.<br /><br />Performance is very good, FullHD video playback consumes about 60% CPU, and HD video consumes 40%.<br /><br />The best part, no doubt, occurs when you unbox it. I reserve what happens, could be interpreted as a spoiler, but it's worth it. Make my whole workgroup scream in astonishment.<br /><br />It's a shame that Amazon has a limit of units per buyer because after buying it, I'm ready to buy the other 60 I need.

B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Great game.  Great fun.  I love the whole Quell series.  Something I can pick up and play forgive minutes or fifty.  The puzzles keep me sharp throughout the day.

B003XMAD3G|5.0|I used this in an older Asus Netbook eeePC that I use to travel with. The netbook came with 1GB of RAM. The performance is night and day after replacing the 1GB with this 2GB ValueRAM from Kingston
B00B4804Q2|5.0|Enjoyed watching this movie as I have collected all of the series and enjoy all of the special featured that come with it.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Even better than first book. The saga and unexpected twist and turns continue at breathtaking speed. Not for the fainthearted. The author is a master in keeping the 6 or so story lines going at breakneck speed.Just when you think you have experienced it all, the story takes a new even more dramatic twist . Totally addictive. Cruel , violent and depressing at times and then it gets worse. . Not a fairy tale. A worthy five star.  Highly recommended.  One of the best storybooks I have ever read.Busy with book 3 which takes a while to get going but WOW, just when you think it is safe the story blindsides you in the chops and flattens you. At least twice. not for sissies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is one of the better &quot;escape&quot; games I have played. Challenging, but not impossible or ridiculous like some others I have played. nice graphics also.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|Great for a free app. Only problem being that it is far to expensive to buy new effect. 4 stars.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun and passes time to I think that u should buy it and it's Free too so ya
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|this is one of the best hog I have ever played.  great graphics, sound effects are really good, the ho pages are hard enough without being ridiculous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some &quot;hidden object &quot; games are too hard.  Some you just try and try then give up.  This one is a perfect blend of not to easy and not to hard.  I enjoyed it.  It did not leave me frustrated as some have done.  Great for making you think.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|The second in the Beautiful Creatures series, this book continued to keep me interested in the characters and their direction but I was not as pulled in as I was in the first book
B005CRQ3RK|3.0|I got this book for our son so I cannot give it a good or bad review. If I have extra time to read the book later, then I will update this review.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I would recommend this movie to mostly a female audience. I enjoyed it. Held my interest the entire length. :0
B005COO1X6|3.0|This is a mediocre story at best. King's work since the mid to late 90's has really been hit or miss for me....
0425263908|2.0|I bought this book thinking I would find a good love story. I found that after reading a similar trilogy that it was redundant. I did not finish it.
B005R32L66|3.0|This product is a great concept but has a long ways to go yet as far as quality goes, especially on phones.
B003K15IF8|4.0|I was moved enough to have tears well up in my eyes three times.  What a beautiful sad monograph!  The story reminds me of Mr. Chips without the English snobbery.  The stoic hero seemed like a Thorstein Veblen character moved from the U of Chicago to U of Missouri.  The story is told gracefully centered on the Comedy of Academic Life.  While the ostensible topic is the Force of Love, it seems more about vicarious experience of the journey of a life.  The experience is very believable.  Hope your life has more beauty and joy than the protagonist, but more than likely, it does not.  Helping the reader accept the course of life is a principal benefit of reading about Professor Stoner's reflections about his life; the whole mess.  Good, bad, and the necessary.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just discovered these types of games and I have been thoroughly enjoying them! Some of them are easy, some are harder, all of them are entertaining.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|I love the challenge of a point and click adventure but this one leaves much to be desired. If you happen to get stuck in the game there are no hints. And when you come across puzzles in the game no instructions are given like other games of this type have. Basically spent my time wandering around and tapping the screen like a fool hoping for something to move the gameplay forward. Disappointing since the game seemed to have great potential.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|If you are like me, then you always need paper and a pen to write stuff down. Well this app makes it so much easier plus you never lose the piece of paper!!!
0843189673|5.0|My little girl loves these books and you can't beat the value of this box set...also purchased the Little Miss set.
B005CRQ3NY|3.0|I got this book for our son so I cannot give it a good or bad review. If I have extra time to read the book later, then I will update this review.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy this show a lot it gives a glimpse into the life of nobility and their staff (servants) as it begins its decline during and after WWI. Lots of drama and plot twist with cliff hangers leaving you with baited anticipation waiting for the next season!
B001I45UFC|5.0|I loved this book as a child and I still love it today. Now I am sharing these great adventures with our children!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun game however the sensitivity to touch could be a bit better. Could use more levels besides the lab and street as well.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This is a mediocre story at best. King's work since the mid to late 90's has really been hit or miss for me....
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game it is fun I just got this game today and I'm already rating this waste you're money on this game it is awesome and rate it five star
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I hate the functionality of these apps, but I love being able to check in on/with my friends from my phone.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|These is a must read. I absolutely love it. I didn't see the ending come but I did. Elite is so angering,but sweet and leaves you wanting to just hop in the book!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|This app is not as easily navigated as I would have expected it to be. Several times I have discovered that I cannot read what I wanted to because I hadn't downloaded it yet. I am used to my Kindle which has everything on it until I remove it....
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I very much enjoyed this production of Northanger Abbey.  I had seen it on television locally some years ago, and felt disappointed at the time as it did not uphold the values that were a feature of Jane Austen's books.  I was really pleased to see that this DVD had been edited, and the offending section removed, so that it qualifies for family viewing.  I'm pleased to have it in my collection and look forward to watching it again and again in the future.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Just discovered these types of games and I have been thoroughly enjoying them! Some of them are easy, some are harder, all of them are entertaining.
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|This book is very informative. I like it now I know the doxies bite is poisonous unless you take the antidote
B00821OX98|5.0|Mad Max meets x-files! You have everything you could ask for action, suspense, drama, romance, comedy and a little history! This show always keeps me hooked and I hope it continues for many seasons to come!
B003TT2X72|1.0|this is not the extended version as advertised, it is just the blue ray version of the theater release, very disaappointed
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|great movie for the family,the kids  loved it i hope there is a number 2 that would be awesome. The whole crew was awesome
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and I am really looking forward to the new season, I love to watch the whole series on Amazon with no commercials you can completely engross yourself in the story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was difficult to stop reading, it kept me wanting more.  Can't wait to read the next one.  Christian Grey is one hell of a character.  LOVE IT!!
0062255657|5.0|A wonderful book. Please someone send it to Hayao Miyazaki ... this would make a marvelous movie in his hands.
B0089OBLDO|4.0|on COD:WAW, Halo Reach, and DCVSMK were the home button always pops up. if anybody can help me out that would be awesome
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Blu-Ray quality is always nice.<br /><br />This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy watching and even find funny. It's by one of my all time favorite directors, so that definitely helps.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This is totally useless for me. I should not have even down loaded it. I would not recommend it to anyone, unless they play the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me Minion Rush is a super fun game. It has great power ups and the challenges are really fun too
B007R41E8O|4.0|I liked the way the game started with them on the boat. Then the next thing is you see blood in the water and a body. I kind of figured that she killed him due to being out there for so long. This game takes you through all kinds of twists and turns but the ending leaves little to be desired unless there is going to be a sequel to it. It's a good game for the price though. I hope they are working on a sequel. There are a few unanswered questions.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game it is very entertaining for small children the only problem is it starts to lag the farther you get in the game.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|More than a musical it is great great music.  Songs are always in my head, and are well worth it..
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Easy to use and does what I want it to.  I couldn't ask for more, I don't have any problems with this at all.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I would watch all the Marvel individual movies before seeing them collaborate together in this one. This helps avoid \\"who is this guy and what is his super power?\\" great balance of each character and love the Hulk.
0307591549|5.0|A very easy read for happiness in the work place and in life in general. Would highly recommend to friends and family.
B001N4OX82|5.0|I realize this movie didn't get great reviews but as someone who loves these types of movies, I very much enjoyed it. The action is non-stop and I always find it interesting to see how they fought back then from a military perspective and the weapons they used. The bottom line is if you like movies like this it's very much worth watching but if you're mediocre about them I wouldn't watch because it's a long movie.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Can't wait for the next one, hopefully the tv show this fall does it justice, there's a lot of potential for the future
B002KS1IJC|5.0|I'm a big fan of Caviezel's from the show &#34;Person of Interest&#34; and he didn't let me down in this one. The plot was unique with an alien going back to medieval times. As I've mentioned before you have to like this type of movie in order to watch it but if you do, I think you'll love it.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is the best book ever written!!!!!!!!!! I have never read a  book by this author but will definitely read s many more books by him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was a book that was touted to me by my daughter. I bought it. I was about a quarter of the way through when I called my daughter and asked if if there was anything uplifting about the book. She said, &#34;No.&#34; I never read another word. Masochism is not my thing.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I liked the book for the most part but i felt that the middle of the book was too long and repetitive. The ending was relieving… but all the interesting parts were jammed into one chapter
B0065AVS0K|5.0|Not what I expected...very unique and a nice surprise. This type of moving isn't for everyone but is right up my alley.
B0063IH60K|4.0|just starting to use  seems very good a great deal for a free app keep up the good work thanks
B003719G40|5.0|Sure helped me understand my husband, son and daughter better, and myself, too!  This should be required reading for every engaged couple.  Love Gary Chapman books!
B0015AARJI|3.0|These controllers are so fragile that if they are dropped or step on accidently they fail miserably. PS needs to offer a better quality product.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was a good game. It had me thinking a lot on every level some of the puzzles were challenging but they were fun
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a relatively brief, most delicious read. Gaiman's careful--and gorgeous--descriptions of rural spaces, succulent meals, and childhood rituals will really transport you into the Hempstocks' world. And you won't want to leave. Exhilarating adventures, terrifying monsters, and an ocean bigger than you think await you. Jump right in.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I respected Linkin Park's different approach on their last album, but I was not a big fan. This album is a nice return to form and contains some great new songs while still staying fresh.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|looking for a new weather app<br />what happened to the simplicity of hourly temps<br />or simple location searches?<br />seems like they just want more ads less users
B00271SFB6|5.0|This is my favorite of all of the bond films. It provides a good look at bond while he was starting out and it was a good change of pace from the previous Bond films.
B00A8LRIEW|5.0|Have had the CD for 6 months.....3 great songs, rest average...the 3 are more than worth it though! Long live NO!
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Phillip Phillips reminds me of a mix of Dave Matthews and Mumford and Sons. The songs on this track sound a little too similar at times, but it's a sound that I like a lot, so I can't complain too much about that.
B00AYB0YFQ|2.0|I know this is a parody of scary movies but I was not a fan. This was number 1 and I just got around to watching it. My hope is they did a lot better with the following sequels.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie won a lot of awards and I wasn't sure how interested I was in it from the commercials, but I finally watched it and I really enjoyed it. Tells a great story, has good acting and good writing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a lot of fun. keeps me busy when trying to pass time. my son also likes to play it. recommend it
B000YR3WUE|5.0|I bought this album for &#34;The Funeral&#34; which is a beautiful song and definitely one of my favorites. The rest of the album turned out to be great too which is always nice.
0788859544|4.0|Came fast, new, just what I expected. I am happy to have this movie again and to have my daughter watch it.
B001O22ELQ|5.0|This musical is one of my favorites. It's unique, the music is catchy and good, and it provides plenty of humor as well.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Disc 1 I could listen to all the way through without skipping a track. Loved the original music in the April trailer and the first half of Flight I received before I'd even seen the movie. And listening to the songs now take me back to certain scenes after having seen it.<br /><br />Only complaint: I just wish the music when Clark discovers the scout ship and when he rescues Lois from the damaged pod were included. I love the sci-fi/extraterrestrial feel of the first (elements of which can be heard on a couple of other tracks), and the religious-mixed-with-superheroic feel of the second.<br /><br />Oh, forgot to mention: loved the metallic casing with the raised S-shield on the front! It's one of the reasons I wanted to buy this album instead of download the standard version.
B003U9TDII|5.0|Hans Zimmer made another great soundtrack with this one. Not just a great soundtrack, but great music in general. All of the music is really good and my personal favorite is &#34;Time&#34; which is one of my favorite songs of all time. It's beautiful and I could listen to it on repeat all day.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|I loved most of the fight choreography in this film. I loved the performances of Henry Cavill as Theseus, Stephen Dorff as Stavros, Luke Evans as Zeus, and Peter Stebbings as Helios. The visuals were interesting to look at, and I really like Greek mythology so the story concept interested me. But the story lacks great execution, character arcs feel incomplete, and some of the other actors were forgettable.<br /><br />Frieda Pinto as the Oracle Phaedra was okay. The actors playing the other Greek gods were okay as well but felt and acted a bit too young to be taken seriously. But Mickey Rourke as King Hyperion did nothing for me; too much mumbling made him hard to understand at times.<br /><br />It also felt like the film didn't really allow Theseus to earn the ending the film gave him. And his fight with the Minotaur was the one action piece that was a letdown for me.<br /><br />But all in all, I was entertained and don't regret getting a used copy for less than $8.
B00498SDN0|5.0|This series is awesome. I think these are one of the few trilogies where I feel like all three movies are equally good.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this app on my kindle and unlike my family's apple products my kindle didn't respond it wouldn't let me agree to the agreements for the app I love the movie but the app not so much.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I have listened to Daft Punk in the past, but never really got into it. This album really caught my fancy. I feel like the songs are more melodic and less repetitive than previous songs of theirs I've heard and I really like it a lot.
B00006AW63|1.0|very slow shipping and handling. not at all what i expected it to be. I was too fast to purchase it that i forgot to read the label about what region it could be played in, partially my fault i admit. but seller didn't replace the dvd so i lost my money and had to just discard it.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|This movie was slow at times, but it was a good viewpoint for the story and it encouraged me to go watch psycho for the first time which was pretty good.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|rapid fast shipping and handling! good deal. love tom cruise in this movie and the movie itself is just fantastic! made me a little emotional in the end though but still great movie!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I love this style of music and these guys are one of the best. This album is just as good as their first. Love them both.
B004SDEP38|5.0|It's great when it's free. I have no complaints for it and it's better than Polaris 4.  It opens words, ppt, excel and Adobe.. So it's everything you will want.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books are great! The story is new and unique and I could not put this story down. Tore through them all and the other Wool books and I can't wait for the rest of the story!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Excellent book and an excellent beginning to what should be an epic series.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|This movie was pretty good with a decent twist in the end. Nice entertaining flick. And Liam Neeson can do no wrong.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I lost 10 lbs in 4 weeks and still going strong.  Best nutrition information I have read in a long time.  Well written.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Another great bond film. The villain in this one was real good and I really liked the new Q. Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond so I'm excited whenever a new Bond movie comes out with him.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Just what I needed.  Gives me all the information I need.  Not bad for free.  I recommend this to anyone.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|The game is ok, but instead of earning lives and other items from  your score they seem to want you to purchase everything.  Turned on Parental Control for this reason only as I did not want to purchase something by accident.  I would rather pay for a game than have to pay and pay as I go.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I like the idea of battling through the control of an alien parasite in order to save the world. The special effects are done well.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Thanks! I really enjoy using this program, it helps me increase my workflow by being able to open PDF's in a more streamlined way.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|This episode really set up the season finale nicely. It was full of good humor and suspense and the usual great dialogue.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Thanks! I really enjoy using this program, it helps me increase my workflow by being able to open PDF's in a more streamlined way.
B00CFA225Y|3.0|Cool graphics, probably fun for the kids. Otherwise the story is just kind of boring. I still enjoyed it though.
B0053O89XI|4.0|Love big bang, cant get enough.  looking forward to a new season being released. Love penny and leonard and sheldon
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|The movie was ok, good graphics, about what I expected. But, this is the first movie I ordered that didn't have a regular dvd to watch when you do not want 3D. That is dumb.
B009ME47H2|5.0|I &lt;3 this app when i create songs i create them on my recorder this one its much more  creative than just writing the song;)
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Love the new format.  I hate all the awards, ads &amp; add-ons.  It Isn't necessary. I think I will be doing a search for a different weather app.
B002GSXKN8|3.0|These discs are a great comparison of what to do with Batman. Watching them again, they seem corny and cartoon-esque. Remember Dick Tracy?  However, Jack Nicholson has several quotable quotes as Joker. Michelle Pfieffer is enjoyable as Catwoman as well.<br />I did have a problem playing the brand-new two-sided discs in 2 of my players.
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|The best Queensryche album in many years!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! THE RYCHE IS BACK!!!!!! I listen to this everyday!! so happy they're back to their original sound.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|More of a romance than a book about magic, I was disappointed to find the author put all the excitement in the first nook
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is really a great way to relax and occupy break time.  The puzzles are really beautiful pictures.  The puzzles offer different options such as only showing edge pieces, different number of pieces for more of a challenge, and rotation of each piece.I recommend  this!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded this game on a whim just to see if it was fun. It is an ok game. But what I found out today, the day after downloading it, is that it apparently runs in the background all the time because I got a notification from the game today telling me to resume my game. There is no way to turn off this behavior in the settings.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is cute, clever, imaginative, thought provoking, adventurous, and funny! If you haven't seen it yet , why not?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the book. The writing and storyline were unique. I had to keep reading to see how it ended!! I live in Missouri so I enjoyed reading references to my State. I already bought the kindle book for my daughter. I do wish there was a way to share-even if it was for a smaller fee.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The text is large enough to read and now with audio books as well from amazon<br />I get the best of both!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This film is true to the book without including every detail.  It is sensative and beautifully filmed. The  acting is uniformly superb. Life of Pi is an absolute pleasure to watch.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is the first time I've played a game like this. I've only completed one level but so far it's fun. Challenging without being too difficult.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|Okay to watch once for graphics. Screenplay is not so great. Gets boring sometimes with act of Robert Downey Jr. Rest of them are okay
B0040I09RM|4.0|Not bad, got me hooked. A bit cheesy at times. I do like the bike stuff. I wish they would get into the motorcycles more than they do.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|they keep giving us these dumb apps but hello no candy crush we want the real candy crush! !!!!!!!!!!! what good is a cheat app if we cant get the game
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I really enjoy this game.  The dinosaurs are amazing and the tasks are challenging but move quickly.  The reason this doesn't have 5 stars is because of the latest update.  Now to play, my program has to download over 50mb every time I switch screens.  It are almost my whole monthly data plan in under 30 minutes!  Plus it crashes constantly!  I'm playing on my kindle fire.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|All around good movie. The singing was great even though some actors were a little rough at times but the acting made up for it! Just remember that this is a musical and every line is sung.
B009R659L8|2.0|If it had been a not well-known author I would have given it three stars.<br />But Mary Higgins Clark has a reputation to maintain, she should not be<br />publishing this kind of work.  Absolutely dissapointed, she has either lost<br />her touch or does not dedicate the same care to her work
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this CD. I saw them on a PBS station which prompted me to purchase this. I also ordered the second one which unfortunately did not arrive, do not know what happened, but they are talented and I enjoy listening while at work.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I'm in love with that concert DVD.  Her voice is great!!  Her talking is nice.  You don't get that feeling from a CD.  Also it comes with CD.  So to bangs for your buck.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I know a lot of people were let down by the Casual Vacancy. It's quite a departure from the fun and exciting world of Harry Potter. This story focuses on the lives of 20 or so people in a small town in England and how they are all affected by the passing of a beloved town councilman. The thing you'll notice first about the book is how much more violent and sexual it is than expected. The story starts off rather slow and may confuse some because it goes through the process of introducing us to each of the main characters. This takes up the first third of the book or so. While I was reading the first third, it didn't seem like there was much of a story to tell. The main plot doesn't really set into motion until the middle of the book, and then it becomes very interesting. The second half becomes exciting and sad, and it expands greatly on the connections between all the main characters. This makes having so many characters confusing for some, but when Rowling goes further into their lives, you will be impressed by how well thought out and well-handled the characters are. Ultimately, this isn't a book for people who need happy endings, or a book for people wanting the next Harry Potter. It is a sad story with a very large scope that will either shock you or just leave you feeling disgusted.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Awesome series...it is quite addictive...have been watching one after the other.  Said what I wanted to say......so why require a certain number of words to be able to submit a comment....therefore I will comment on no more items.  The end.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|It's been a fantastic adventure watching these classic movies again!  I totally forgot how great they were and watching in BluRay brought it he theater experience back!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This game was great for playing  not the go and for all kinds of trips like plane rides and such fun. That I couldn't put it down for a whole day. I luv this guns and all that storyline. Can't wait for more<br />Chefgonzo
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The nearest experience of being Tony Stark as Iron Man.<br /><br />I approve this opinion which is in everything is there
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I love Imagine Dragons .... Great songs that go beyond Radioactive (which I do love so) Grab yourself a copy today ;)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great SF story!  I became obsessed by the plot of this book after reading the first page.  It sells for an excellent price and is a very well written book(s).
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|This film is high caliber in all respects.  The writing is superb and draws the characters out in profound ways.  Helen Mirren, as always, exquisite and all the actors as well.<br /><br />Fascinating subject if history and psychology interests you.<br /><br />Gorgeous cinematography, direction and design.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Jaycee's honesty is admirable, especially in view of the pain it must have caused her to relive the horrific experience. Her resilience is remarkable and her spirit is simply a miracle. She excuses the erratic process of her writing, but in this very special case, it only reinforces her story. She will undoubtedly encounter many obstacles as she bravely moves forward to make a good life for herself and her girls. But after what she's lived through and the way she handled it, there's no doubt she'll succeed. God bless you Jaycee!
067144901X|5.0|Moo, Baa, La La La! Is one of my favorite books.  We recently bought the app for this book on our Kindle, and it makes the animal sounds when the children touch them.  My niece/nephew absolutely love to read this book, and they are able to say what sounds the animals make.  It is a fun book to read to children, and it is a must for every household!
B008Y6YCB0|2.0|Found  it overall a ho hum, would not recommend it unless you want an ultimate chick flick on a long empty rainy saturday when you hope to fall asleep.
B0000524E5|3.0|When this movie came out in 2000, I was a horny 15 year old. I wanted to see it, but I never got around to watching it. 13 years later, I purchased the DVD. I don't regret my decision. Like many people said, the movie is basically an excuse to show hot women in tight leather pants- and there's nothing wrong with that. The plot is very predictable. I won't summarize the entire plot, but it has every lame cliché- the shy girl who goes to the city to try to make it as a performer but has to settle for a humiliating job, the boss who starts off as abusive but eventually befriends her, the father who at first disapproves of her career choice but then supports her in the end. They also made the trite fat jokes about John Goodman.<br /><br />Despite the flaws of this movie, it is entertaining. The unrated version features a hot sex scene. I enjoyed watching Tyra Banks shaking her booty. The songs in the movie were pretty good. I loved Leann Rimes' performance. And since the movie was made in 2000, the World Trade Center was still standing. It is featured prominently throughout the movie. I recommend this movie. It is not Academy Award material, but it's a nice movie for a rainy day.
B0096MM9GG|5.0|I think that Ubisoft made a great game designed well for a good performance on Amazon kindle and with an interesting history.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I like this app but most of my friends don't have a kik account and so I can't text them. Only my sister and one friend has kik. And my sister got locked out of here the first time. If you are going to by this make sure who you want to text has a kik account first. And one more thing what's up with the oil bot they give you all it does is give you random facts out of the blue. For little kids who just like pressing buttons and none of there friends have kik, kik bot is a great friend
0062238868|5.0|This book gives you  not only a glimpse of the SEALs but an enlightening view of the Iraq war.  Kris Kyle was an intensely dedicated patriot who made incredible personal sacrifices for his country. As he progresses through the book it becomes evident  that  the tough, indestructible Navy SEAL had a very real human side as well. This book held my interest all the way through.  Those guys are incredible!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|When I first saw this app and it's pictures,  I thought that it would be fun and awesome. But it's not. It's really boring actually because...<br /><br /> 1. Their are only two people you can choose from to do their hair unless you buy the other two people<br />2. Some of the controls on the game are hard to use<br />3. You have to buy almost all of the fun and cool hair colors and hair accessories<br />4. It takes forever to do their hair because you have to do it one strand at a time( and it is very frustrating because when you move the hair, it does not go where you want. And it is frustrating because when you cut one strand of her hair, it cuts all of her hair off... which I do not want).<br /><br />So please do not waste your time with this app... it is hard to use and it is boring. This game just tries to persuade you into buying more stuff so that they can have your money. And actually, I think that the game would still be boring even with all the hair colors, accessories, and people. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! IT IS BAD!!!
B009GXHOW4|1.0|it freezes Soo much. I am not even joking and then it says you didn't purchase it when you did.
B0058SNKRY|3.0|The size chart said to there were no half sizes. Therefore I ordered down one size as suggested.  Normally I need a wide shoe and these are no exception. Comfortable for small periods of time, but not a shoe where your feet will be cool.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|what a wonderful game.  It is hours of fun for all ages.<br />I would recommend this game to everyone who wants a challenge.
1594136238|4.0|Not quite 5 stars and the ending was somewhat depressing, but it was a really good read. Made me consider different parental points of view and relationships.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The author shuffles back and forth between characters and elapsed time so I ended up having to re-read certain sections, but all-in-all a good read.
B0094K1K42|4.0|YA doesn't quite put it all together but its an interesting dark comedy with surprisingly thoughtful topics. If nothing else, the movie should be watched to appreciate the Charlize Theron performance.
B00503BN1M|5.0|Made me laugh, made me cry, made me sigh.  The epitome of romantic comedies.  I highly recommend this movie!  Guys will like it too, it has enough crudeness and sappiness to satisfy the crowds.
B005F9TQ4C|4.0|This is a seriously underrated album. Full of great songs. Changing of the Guards and No Time to Think are epic, New Pony and Baby Stop Crying ( both have great vocals) are top-notch, and Is Your Love in Vain and Senor are deep as hell.  The finality of Dylan's marriage comes across throughout the album. He sounds doomed. The sound of the 80s is on the horizon. The bad production, a weak spot on the original version of the album, is polished in the Remastered version. I liked the original but I like this version a lot better. It brings the songs to life.<br /><br />The highlight is Where Are You Tonight. I listen to this song over and over when it comes on and I can't stop. Every line is brilliant. Everytime I hear the song, I learn something new. It's an awesome song and I'd rank it in Dylan's top ten of all time. To me, Street Legal is the final part of a trilogy which begins with Blood on the Tracks and continues with Desire. It's not a happy ending, but it's a great story nonetheless.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun to play. Some levels were pretty tricky. Could not stop playing the game. Wish it had more than ten levels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If have enjoyed playing solitaire for several months now. The game functions well and is very relaxing.  It is a fun game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love it. tells me when storms are coming. i rate it 5 stars. Thank you keep the good stuff coming.<br />Lorraine.<br />raine.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game it's awesome but I think it should have other minions to choose from like tall ones or other  sizes but the game is still awesome!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works off line as well as offline. lots of fun rate it 4 stars. will to play it again.<br />raine.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I recommended this game for boys and girls because my brother and I play this game and I just got  this game there days ago. I love it
B005HSL626|4.0|it gave my toddlers something to do at the end of the day and keeps them off of a wet floor after i scrubbed. rate it five stars.<br />raine.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it the best game I ever played I will recommend this to people get bord easily or love horses
B007N5YIUS|5.0|fun to play i rate it 5 stars. i greatly enjoyed the game. i even beat my daughters high scores.<br />Raine.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is such an awesome game!!!! It's so much fun and it actually is pretty realistic! Definitely worth downloading because it's free and awesome!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Good Movie they dont have to much special effects but you can join this movie with your family, included kids
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I liked it the first time. I loved it the second. Thought-provoking, beautiful, and entertaining...we need more of these movies. But because it's so rare, it makes me appreciate the film that much more. I'll very likely watch it for the third time and I'm sure my appreciation for the film will only grow.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was very &#34;provocative&#34;.  I kept trying to figure out &#34;who done it&#34;.  I would have never imagined how the book would end, not in a million years!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really good game. It's fun and the graphics are fine. Easy to figure out. I think plenty of people could enjoy it.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Ok so you hate the timer well you can make a new world after your time runs out I do it all the time on my Samsung it works I have yet to try it on my kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because it has the coolest characters.  I also love it because it gives the coolest prizes that are very helpful.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|Supertramp in its prime with excellent sound and video for the late 70's. I thoroughly enjoyed the concert and wish I could have been there.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this game but need more lives. I have a couple of games and this one is the  best. I was looking for candy crush saga and couldn't find it and I ran across this and I'm really happy with it
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Mi kids really love it, you've got to download it! Excellent app... I would give it a 5 stars rating, but I reserve it to another kind of apps.
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|I have seen his all star band twice. It was a great show and the group from this show were great.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|It just didn't work for me.  Too quickly remedied at the end.  With not even a clear definition of why the young woman would go for the doctor and kill her husband. I wasn't convinced and I didn't enjoy it much but I absolutely love Jude Law and Rooney Mara.  Maybe if I watched again I will see things I didn't' see the first time. But I wouldn't pay money to see it again.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I bailed, I found I just wasn't in the mood for it. I gave in to &#34;everybody's watched it&#34;.  I'm just sayin'
0345803485|4.0|I have never read any thing like this before. So I don't have anything to compare this book to but I was hooked.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|It certainly is the most intimate work of Neil Gaiman so far. And it shatters your heart. But then again maybe Neil is right, and maybe one can grow a whole new one.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I know there has been much debate about the ending of the Sookie Stackhouse series, but I honestly think Charlene Harris got it just right.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|The fan is excellent -- well made, well put together, and my core temp went from 60+ Celsius with a stock fan to 26 with this fan.<br /><br />That being said ... I have over 20 years of experience with PC's, got my first job in PC repair in 1988, and now work as a senior systems architect for a Fortune 50 company.  Despite this experience, which is surely greater than most, it took me about half an hour to figure out how to put this thing together because the directions were so poor.  I realize that \\"picture only\\" directions save money, as they don't have to be translated, but occasionally a few words are better than pictures for communicating.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I am extremely satisfied my car charger.  It has a small footprint, but it has an awesome kick when charging my devices.
B000SEHJGQ|2.0|Mr. Bukowski, I so wanted to like this book but perhaps it is that the mind of a horny teenage boy just isn't that exciting after all these years...
B00915G6YE|5.0|All caught up within one weekend of season 7 with Dexter... Fast delivery, with no problems with cd, or cracked case..
B007TXN4TK|1.0|it doesnt give you hardly ANYTHING to play. i hate it.  works slow and way to many adds. Dont buy it
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Another great book from Nalini Singh. I now buy her books on her name alone. I always know that the book will have a good story line and will also be well written. Thanks Nalini v
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love the game but I need to have friends in order to get some things and most of the people I know don't have an ipad or kindle fire. Forget about a smart phone, I mean I'm only 14! They should make it to where you can buy hearts for like a thousand bits. Plus they need to fix a glitch. If I get off the game after I do something then it will Undo what I did! So frustrating
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|Any Allman Bros. fan should add this one to their collection.  Get a real feel for what the band was all about.  Truely a time of sorrow and joy for the band, a must have!!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|The third book by Scalzi that I have enjoyed immensely and can heartily recommend. The others are &#34;The Androids Dream&#34; and &#34;Fuzzy Nation&#34; btw.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie it was suspensefull and kept my attenion. A little freaky i jumped a few times loved the ending. People should defintealy watch it if havent before
B00CO4CVN4|4.0|The book is straight forward, gives clear guidance which is effective. The exercises on each chapter really help you to remember and memorize what have been taught in that chapter. It also helps to make the concepts clearer when you do the exercises. So I would suggest not to skip the exercises. So far...I like it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot of fun can't wait for new rooms love how it makes you think but not to hard for the younger kids
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome. If you like challenging games this is the game for you. I just got my kindle and this is the game I play the  most. It is free and basically the best game ever.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|It is difficiult to set kindle to read by folding cover to make stand......it doesn't stay but keeps collapsing ....
B00D4PDJMY|3.0|The songs are amazing but Bedridden is a duplicate of Irrelevant Walls. May have just been something weird with my computer.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series!  Such a great storyline and I feel so invested in the characters.  I can't wait for the next book!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I love Playrix games! I have a hard time putting this one down. I highly recommend this game to any match 3 game lovers.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|I have tried several similar games in which I was stumped for hours to days but this one was way too easy for me! I do understand its for all ages but a little challenge would b nice . Less 3 letter words maybe or separate levels<br />by difficulty perhaps? Just a thought.
0385486804|2.0|Krakauer is a great writer, but, like several other reviews stated, this book doesn't really go anywhere.   So much of it just seems like filler and frankly, I found myself disliking this Chris McCandless more with every page.  He comes off as a selfish young man, trying desperately to convince himself that he is more grown-up and mature than he really is. The reality is that the selfish young man went in to the brutal Alaskan wilderness frighteningly unprepared and under the cocky assumption that he had it under control, that he could overcome nature and anything it threw at him. Guess what? He was wrong.  I found the book slow and boring and simply could not come away with any sort of sympathy or good impressions of its central character.  Bottom line: Check it out at the library or something, but don't pay money for it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. I found myself laughing often and staying up just to finish it. I found it refs hang to read from a males perspective on falling in love. I would recommend for a light funny read!
B0089EHWQE|3.0|I was excited to explore the issue of assisted suicide. But the book just touched on the controversy without really getting in to it. The end fell flat for me.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Sticks pretty close to the book, Great photography.  Robicheaux seemed a little bit too quick to go to fist city.
1449433251|5.0|What a great collection. From the foreward by Watterson to the carefully organized pages with the comics, this is a must have for any Calvin and Hobbes fan.
B004SDEP38|3.0|Not the best UI in town, but basically very functional. I definitely don't see the point in the huge price and am very glad to have downloaded it from Amazon AppStore for free!
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Purchased it  for my Dad for Father's Day. He had already seen the movie and wanted to have it  at home
B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this book because it was the selection of my book club, so I didn't really have a choice. Once I picked it up, however, I couldn't put it down. The plot is twisted and kept me on my toes. I tend to guess endings, so I liked that this one wasn't super easy to figure out. I plan on reading more books by this author.
B00000J7S8|4.0|Really nice album, sultry and sexy.  Would definately recommend to would be buyers.  The Look of Love is one of my favorite albums of hers.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|As soon as you start using this speedlight you're going to realize you didn't have a complete DSLR system UNTIL you bought this.<br />Your photos WILL be better. Your frustration level WILL be less because you won't be missing shots waiting for your pop up flash to recharge and your camera's battery will last longer.<br />Unless you are a &#34;real&#34; professional photographer this flash will take care of 97% of your shooting needs. Don't get suckered into spending HUNDREDS of dollars more.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|Not my favorite album of Diana's but certainly pleasant to listen to. Probably wouldn't purchase again if I had to do it all over again.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is rockin awesome but I wish that there was many more levels to play in<br /> and a vs mode would also be cool
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really enjoy this app, I like how it gives alerts about severe weather. I like that it stays on the screen, you don't have to go to the app to see the temp, unless you want more detailed updates.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie first, and then decided to read the book....I wasn't disappointed.  I like that I was able to expand on the movie that I liked.  I will not be waiting for the next movie before reading the rest though
0393339882|5.0|Quantum, by Manjit Kumar, is the best non-technical book I have read about quantum theory. It makes clear to the reader that, unlike most earlier theories, quantum physics was a creation of many minds. And it \\"humanizes\\" these many players by discussing their origins, their professional careers and their personal lives, as well as the ideas they added to the \\"quantum stew.\\"<br /><br />The subtitle is \\"Einstein, Bohr, and the Great Debate About the Nature of Reality.\\" But the reader should be prepared to read relatively little on that subject. Most of the volume deals with the theory per se, and not with the quasi-philosophical debate between these two titans of the modern era. I frankly found that the Bohr/Einstein debate grew tedious, and was happy that it constitutes only a minor part of the book.<br /><br />Included midway through the volume is a slew of photographs of most of the major contributors to quantum theory, and it's always fun to see what this gallery of Nobel laureates looked like. All in all the book is one of the most entertaining reads I have ever leafed through. It is, as they say, a real page turner, and I give it my highest recommendation to all who seek some light reading on this great development of the 20th century. G.R.Dixon, Mesa, AZ, July 2013.
B008JFUR10|5.0|After I finished watching this film, the first thing I thought was how this reminded me of Voltron.  It was a series I watched religiously as a child.  Of course, if you saw that show, the best part was when Voltron would battle a monster.<br /><br />This shows that Japanese Anime was way ahead of its time.  This kind of plot between big machines versus monsters is a very old concept in that genre.  The problem is that the Japanese never made a movie like Pacific Rim.  It was probably because it would take a sizable budget to make a movie about it.  It was all cartoons and I finally grew up and stopped watching Anime.<br /><br />That is why, after I saw the trailers, I was anxiously looking forward to watching this film.  It has a big budget.  Why is that important?  Because you know that the monsters and the robots are not going to look good with cheesy special effects that you see in a low-budget sci-fi film.<br /><br />Then I saw Pacific Rim.  I was impressed.  I was not expecting to see the monsters until the very end of the film.  That was not the case.  You see the monsters and the robots throughout the film.  The first monster makes its appearance in under 5 minutes.  Awesome!!!!<br /><br />I will tell you this.  The battle scenes are way better than the ones found in Michael Bay's Transformers.  You can actually see who is who and the fighting moves are vividly clear.  This makes the film more fun to watch.  My only problems with the fight scenes were they happened at night and, for some reason, it was always raining.  I guess there was a reason for that.  I will have to ask the director.<br /><br />The good thing is that the film is not all special effects.  It has a pretty decent script.  The positive thing that entails is that the film engages you while there is no fighting or monsters in the film.  The downtime scenes are all pertinent to the plot of the film.  There are no baloney scenes in this film that make it longer for no reason.  In fact, I wouldsay the film goes by fast and does not drag at all.<br /><br />I give the film five stars.  This is for two reasons.  It is something you have to see in a theater.  It also is a movie you can add to your home collection and watch it again and again if you like sci-fi.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The best season yet.  Makes you laugh and enjoy excellent acting from whole staff. Don't miss this show, it is #1.
B00A2H9P98|3.0|I watched the film at the theater when it first came out.  After it was done, I thought the film was three hours.  I was shocked when I checked my watch and the film was only about two hours and five minutes long.  It made me realize how much this movie dragged at times.<br /><br />For me to give an average review of an Emmerich film is not the norm.  I like many of his films.  Independence Day, 2012, and the Day After Tomorrow are very entertaining films.  Emmerich films are the kind of films that I like to watch in a theater.  They are fun, suspenseful and not preachy at all.  The special effects, of course, are usually the stars of his film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this film is closer to 10000 BC.  The movie is not a complete flop, but it is not as good as it could have been.  For whatever reason, the parts did not equal a great engaging film.  There are points where you tire of the film and want it to end.<br /><br />What gets me is that the first 20 to 30 minutes give you the impression it is going to be a good movie.  It feels like it is going to lead to better things.  It does not happen.  The middle of the film ruins the movie.  When the terrorists take over, the movie slows down and it lacks the action/adventure pump that you wish you see from an Emmerich film.<br /><br />So why do I give the film three stars?  The film is not bad enough for me to tell you not to watch it.  For one-time watching, it is passable.  I will say that this is not a film you will watch again.  It is not good enough of a movie that you will add to your collection to see it again in a year.
0060763280|5.0|T Harv Eker nails it with this great book. He clearly guides us (the reader) to understand our deep inner conflicts and then shows us how to reprogram our mindset effectively to increase our ability to manifest the life success we seek
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|It was really fun but it costed money to play the game which totally sucks, but it won't even let you exchange the silver coins you earn for the stupid gold ones
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Guys this is a awesome game of despicable me you have to play this game it's awsome it's just like awaken swamps on roblox
B008HTQ28K|5.0|Excellent book. Could not put it down. Should be made into a movie. Suspense from start to finish. Grisham is good at his game.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Great songs - fun summer music!  If you like Florida Georgia Line you will enjoy this CD - we love it!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game will not update on my kindle fire. I cannot go into El  muchos lair. Did anyone else's do this?
1451695195|3.0|I guess I was hoping to find a more common NDE story in this book, and although it wasn't what I expected, it was still OK.  Interesting.  Unusual.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|love it. Fun to play. Wish it didn't take to long to level up tho. kids love it also, tho I play it the most.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Not as dramatic as the Netflix series, the book does tell a good story of Pipers time at Danbury. There have been some reviews that criticize Piper for not taking responsibility for her crime, but I do think that she talks about her crime in a realistic way. While she is much more fortunate than many of her fellow inmates, she recognizes that and talks of the ineffective system that forgets these unfortunates. I enjoyed it very much
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app gets me organized very  well, it can also do a lot of great things! Helps you store a lot of things
0345529057|3.0|Character's grown to like in 1st three books, dropped completely in the last book.  Lame apology by author at end of the last book depleted the trust account.  Not encouraged to read any future works by this author.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|was one of the best zombie books I ever read! If you are looking for action, than this is a very good book to read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a better temple run it is so cool I like Paris I'm going for the zombie zoey how cool I resettled the game so I could save money for zoey
B000000XB9|5.0|We used to have an 8 track in our car & listened to this album all the time.  This CD sounds exactly like the 8 track back then.  We love it as much as we did then.
0316247545|5.0|Every MLP lover should have this. I bought it for my niece's birthday. Good solid quality. I would recommend it.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|This game is like temple run but its not. One its a fps (first person shooter). Two its zombies. Three you can run into obstacles freely without dieing but not zombies run into them and its over. And there are many more differences but who cares this game is great. Tip go to the birds they are above weapon crates. Plus the musics not that bad not that great but its not that bad. Better than temple run. Get this game its free...for now
B000FC1KBG|1.0|I am a mom to a 6 1/2 month old baby. I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend; I thought it might offer good sleep advice. What I found instead was a book that made me alternately angry and amused. I wanted to throw it across the room several times, but ended up reading many of the passages out loud to my husband. They were so bizarre and terrible they became funny to me. I feel for anyone attempting to learn about breastfeeding from this book, however. If you have a desire to breastfeed, I would steer clear of this book, which says it promotes personal choice but in fact provides questionable information regarding breastfeeding and pretty much disregards science and the advice of reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization. The author says \\"I provide empowering information -- without the rocket science or statistical numwhack that conventional breastfeeding books tend to bombard you with\\" (p. 101). She goes on to question all the proposed benefits of breastfeeding and says nothing at all of the cons of formula. I agree that this should be a personal choice, but a choice based on facts, not the wishy-washy opinions of some self-acclaimed \\"baby-whisperer.\\"<br /><br />Most of this book is just gimmicky. Every baby is different -- the E.A.S.Y. method is not a one-size-fits-all. I detested the author's braggish attitude of the \\"help\\" she has provided to countless new parents and I laugh at the idea of anyone changing a baby's/parents' \\"bad\\" habits in just three days. This woman is making oodles of money off desperate sleep deprived new parents -- she doesn't need yours. Avoid this book unless you want a good laugh.
030758836X|3.0|Never before have I read a book where I've disliked both main characters so intensely. Not a single redeemable quality between them. Gone Girl is a well-written, thoughtful, complex read that kept me guessing, which I liked. However, it is so depressing I found it difficult to read. I stopped and started this book several times because I was so frustrated by Nick's stupidity but once I got into it, I plowed through to the (disappointing) ending. I don't read fictional books so I can be depressed. There are enough depressing things in real life. I felt like I needed a long shower and a therapy session after finishing this book.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved this series but doubt if I will read the following two books. Really, two more? Wasn't there enough money made on three?  I feel I was duped. There are so many books by great authors and really so little time to read  so I won't be wasting any more with this series.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I use words for a living, but I don't have the right ones to explain how much I loved this movie!  I'll just put my two cents in here with most of the planet and chime in to say it's made of awesome!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read it in no time. I Could not put it down. I will read the third one next. What a great series!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Love, Love LOVE this movie!  I was worried when they decided to make a new Bourne movie without Damon, but Jeremy Renner delivers in this performance.  There was great chemistry between him and Rachel Weisz too, I highly recommend this movie!
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is a great story about a boy names August(Auggie)Pullman. Auggie has a face defect and looks abnormal. the book takes you through different peoples perspective of the school year. When I was reading this book I thought this book was just like My Life as a Book so if you have read that you will like this book. This Book stands out to me in a lot of ways but it mostly stood out by being a realistic fiction like Myb Life as a Book, Flush, or The Batboy (three book I read last year) that were great just like Wonder. The people that have read any of the other book I have mentioned would like Wonder because it is just like Wonder whereas it has its ups and downs so that's why they would like it. I loved this book because it had a ton of funny parts while still have so low points which I liked because its just like life where you have ups and downs. Wonder is a terrific book and if its not already out I hope R. J. Palacio write a second book to go with wonder (like the next year of school)!
B008Y768XO|5.0|Made me think about how much my own dog add to the quality of my life and the other members of our family. I was really impressed with the handling of the dogs used to portray Hachi and the believable bond between Hachi and his chosen owner.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I just saw the most recent adaptation of this book and I really enjoyed this so much more than the movies. I would have enjoyed a more literal interpretation of the book to the screen.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The title of this review pretty much says it all. I was hooked by the end of the first paragraph and ended up reading the entire book in one sitting. At about 200 pages, it's a really fun, quick read.<br /><br />For anyone who's familiar with Gaiman's work, you already know that his stories have a beautiful cadence. For those who may be new to him, this book would serve as an excellent place to start to fall in love with his work. Within minutes of starting this book, you'll find the main character to be someone who feels real and relatable. You'll be on his side and you'll be compelled to know what's going to happen to your new friend next. And the end? Well, I'll let you get there on your own...no spoilers...but I will tell you that it's lovely and perfect and will pull at your heart strings in a way that only Neil Gaiman can.<br /><br />In short, this is a must read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows on television. Season 3 takes the series to the next level with a few shockers.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Although the first section of the book seemed slow to me, after the denoument, the pace and interest picked up. I feel the writer's interests expressed in the beginning were not very relevant to the theme. Also, the ending of the book, introducing an interesting twist, does not completely hold up logically in my mind, either. Characterization of the protagonist is great. Internal conflict is riveting and external conflict provides the glue to continue the journey all the way through.
B000FC1336|4.0|Gripping storyline and love how he draws out the plot. Author has great knowledge of submarine warfare.  If you like Tom Clancy novels, this is a must read.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This plays even better on the tablet as compared to the pc.  This game is a whole lot of fun!
B00846REIS|1.0|Bought this because of great reviews, and had high hopes for it, but ... ugh. The book seems to rip off 50 Shades, with characters saying almost the same lines.  How did the author get away with this, when it seems like plagiarism? Felt like an attempted re-do of 50 Shades, but with characters I did not like. **SPOILERS** Whatever their demons are, they'll just keep having sex to forget about everything.  Even when Gideon tries to sleep-rape Eva! Come on! Only a few hours later, she wants it???  Eva really confuses me with her behavior, considering she was a victim of harrowing abuse. And I just don't care enough about Gideon to find out what is in his past, I'd rather just leave them to go at it like bunnies.  The sex scene descriptions were cringe-worthy, cruder than other stories I've read - sorry, but I just can't stand the c-word & I know many others who find it offensive. Sorry I spent money on this; guess I'll need to read a lot more reviews of books before I decide to buy.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The old version was better. At least you could play with the map and have clouds and rain at the same time.
B00D5CENXA|5.0|I found Mountain Justice an excellent read.  The plot was tight and the characters were well-developed.  This short story left me looking for more of Karen Black's short stories to read.  Highly recommended.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|After enjoying the other two books that I have read by this author, I was disappointed in this one.  I was unable to connect with the underdeveloped characters.
034580709X|3.0|I received a pre-release copy of [[ASIN:034580709X The Bat: The First Inspector Harry Hole Novel (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard Original)]] for review. While the first of the series, it hasn't been published in the US before now.<br /><br />It is the first Nesbo book that I've read. Harry Hole (holl-uh, or \\"Holy\\" as they call him in Australia) is an alcoholic wreck of a copper. I found this introduction to be quite a turn-off: there is a LOT of attention paid to Harry's bad habits and bodily functions. I suppose one has to lay solid groundwork for a series, but jeezo-peezo, we coulda had more story and less vomiting.<br /><br />My wife is a huge Nesbo fan, but isn't into these gritty details. She's really struggling to get through this book. Some folks may hugely enjoy knowing all about Harry Hole, but I found it far more background than I need.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|The art is great, the music is very good, the presentation maybe can be improved.<br /><br />The ripped music download is good.
B004H4XI5O|3.0|If you want to be in competition this book is for you. If you want  help in finding your car keys I don't think it will help
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I love this mouse.<br />The interface software is easy to use and the buttons are all fully programmable and macro-able. I just hope I can find a left handed version for my coworker before he steals mine!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Really enjoy playing it.!  I would recommend it to anyone with a Kindle.  Now my husband wants a Kindle so he can play too!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Magical, riveting, revealing, insightful.  A book of life, complicated love, amazing stories of the connectedness of a family across generations .A story of hope and understanding and acceptance of change. I found a deeply personal message about loss, guilt and acceptance in this gift of a book. Can't wait to his next book. Bonnie
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Easy read, great writing, and the subject is about perhaps the greatest creator of our time. I am going to the Apple store now.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Awesome sci-fi movie.  Great acting and script.  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My boys and I love this game.  It is nice that you do not have to spend money to unlock items, you can earn enough coins over time to unlock everything.
B001EC2J20|5.0|Awesome follow up to the original The Matrix. Already has me looking forward to the 3rd movie. one, two, three
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is one film I saw three times in the theater before I purchased the DVD and watched it several times again with friends
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|The HTC Double Dip Flip Case for HTC One is an one-of-a-kind product that has ever been introduced to the cellular world. It has a great sophisticated look for the 'business' minded person. The red interior gives the case an exuberant look that enhances the look of the cellular phone and case simultaneously. The case completely covers all edgers of the HTC One.<br /><br />While I do not promote texting and driving, be aware that this case really makes cellular phone use difficult while driving. In other words, if you are attempting to put an address into the GPS, please do it before driving because the flip of the case is made to stay closed unless in tv/horizontal mode.<br /><br /> I believe that I will love this case forever!
1931559317|5.0|I can't believe I went so long without a star atlas. Small, inexpensive, durable, and easy to use in the field. This will definitely be a must-have for me from now on.
B0074JODP8|5.0|I love Bonamassa - his guitar artistry and his amazing blues/rock vocals!! This is a must have video for those who have discovered this extraordinary talent. Just watching him perform is a big factor in enjoying his performance - he is amazing to watch and pure soul!! Love the video!!
B0000256KE|4.0|A big advance over their debut album, and a showcase for some truly weird, deeply accomplished musicianship. \\"Do the Strand\\" and the inflatable doll song are certified Roxy standards, but coming back to this album after a long layover I was struck by how loose and daring the players sound. It's especially notable on the second side (aka, the last three songs) where the band stretches out in ways that would never be seen on later albums.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I wish I could tell everyone that I liked this movie . But I can't . Because I never Received it . I've been waiting for over a month for it!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game.I only have one issue though.In order to get more characters you have to get a crazy amount of coins,but besides that I enjoy the game.I think it is also good for the brain.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|at about level 15 it started freezing up the kindle fire. maybe I touch stuff too quick but a locked up fire is no fun.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|fun game but wish there  was more ways to get aura. and its way to hard to get extra workers without having to spend real money!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Everything they said PLUS if you connect to surround sound in your living room, Bluetooth in your car or at least some BOSS headphones, you might have a heart attack and LIKE IT!!  If you do all that AND PLAY IT IN THE DARK... the devil will possess your soul.  Buy some popcorn and make it a night!
B008JFUPFI|5.0|It's truly a awesome movie great casting choice Henry Cavill truly does look like superman should be go watch it 5/5
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like that it has different modes for each room, but you can only play as along as you have energy. So for me it boils down to ten minutes of play a day! I don't like that the jem's run out quick with killing phonemes in the rooms and if you don't get rid of them it cost more energy to explore. Okay game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It is a GREAT puzzle game takes a bit to load but WORTH IT I highly recommend it to anybody that likes any kind of puzzle game. Can't wait till the next one comes out.
B009P1WES6|4.0|I don't like really creepy, violent books or films and this has a very challenging beginning. I hated it but then I had to read the rest of the book to find out what happened. It was a good story with lots of twists and turns
B007EC27QM|5.0|This calculator is so easy to use.the keys are big enough for touchscreen .the calculator is as big as the screen.love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it such a fun game to kill time with just like temple run my kids love it and the movies
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Picked this up as the FAoTD. The concept is fun, though there could have been more dimension to the &#34;buy low-sell high&#34; activities.<br /><br />But the real complaint here is that the game is short, very repetitive, and the speedboat controls are HORRIBLE. Seriously, why can't you take off the throttle?<br /><br />Played for a couple of hours, then uninstalled.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|First time reading from this author. Good story, flowed well, kept  me interest to the end., I will consider reading more of her books.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|SLICK graphics, neat concept, nice effects, lots of challenging levels, NO crashes and NO offensive permissions?<br />My goodness, I'm in heaven. Kudos, ZeptoLab team! (Ready for more levels, you guys!!!)
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This story is a must read. It starts off slow but then you cannot put the book down. It brought tears to my eyes on many parts.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Glad I didn't pay for this one... what a disappointment. I see that other reviewers are playing, so maybe it's not a widespread problem. But for me, it's a total bust.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|There's a lot of swiping the screen in this game along with tilting the Kindle. I don't know, maybe I'm just not fast enough on the trigger or if I'm swiping wrong, but I die pretty fast in this game. It doesn't keep me from trying 10-15 games in a row, but it does keep me from playing it more often.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Picked this up as the FAoTD, but I'd previously played and enjoyed the free version. I think you'll like how customizable it is, and there are some intuitive features that will spoil you for whenever you do Sudoku on paper!<br /><br />One thing I really appreciate about the game design is how it operates without hiding the taskbar on my phone - I can still see the clock, notifications, etc. Other advantages include quick boot and shut-down, no invasive permissions, no prods for social media, and no matter how you close the app, your current game is saved for when you return.<br /><br />Nice job, development team!
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|Still don't like it but went to the concert and now I like it more. Nothing close to loud but good on its own. My favorite song by far is love without tragedy. Should have been a ten min song. So timeless and beautifully done. For that song alone she got an 8 star. The others brought it down to 4.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Believe all the negative reviews.  This film was a catastrophe in many ways.  There were inconsistencies that I will not go into detail on, but the script was perhaps the worst part.  The actors were probably not allowed to ad lib and told to stick to the script exactly - so many of the characters were robotic, their movements seemed like 1980's computer game characters, and their dialogue was not believable.  Finally, as many have pointed out, the scientists were really nothing more than hippies calling themselves scientists, apparently.  Watch the opening sequence for the beautiful shots of Iceland, but leave it at that.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love the main character Emily posing a  Hamptons socialite but really a very smart martial arts trained tough girl from juvie seeking revenge. Elements of Girl with dragon tattoo and Kill Bill. Also fascinating is the otherworldly culture of the ultra rich in the very upscale beach community.
B00B84652O|5.0|I got this brand new box set when the price dropped to $13.99, and it was an amazing deal.  There are 5 complete albums in this set.  I was worried that the sound quality might be lacking, but they sound fantastic.  Inside the box, each CD is safely housed in its own sleeve, like an old record (as seen in product photo) so there are no booklets with the lyrics.  If you want to listen to King Diamond, and you don't care about extra features, you can't beat this set.  I'm very glad I bought it and I'm completely satisfied.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It was a really good movie.  I enjoy movies with Bruce Willis.  I would recommend it.  I rented it before red 2 comes out
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|pigs on hills, pigs on cliffs, virtual tinker-toy building of vehicles, strange, but fun; frustrating, but yes, i have to say Pig-tastic
B004SBULWE|2.0|The task killer wants to kill tasks I use all the time. It was not working for me. I had to kick it off.
0425263924|5.0|I started this series after reading the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy and thought it was pretty good. The story leave it open at the end for another book which should be interesting.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Love this movie. Very action packed and always keeps you wanting more. I can't wait for the second avengers to come out.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Although it may feel a little dissapointing not to have the main characters meeting, its is a great friendship story.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The kids do love playing it but they hate that it takes so long to load and begin an actual game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Even though at times this book seemed unrealistic, the story line drew me in and I really enjoyed reading it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a fun, exciting and awesome game for all ages that you will never want to stop playing so enjoy !
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Minion Rush is a fun game that quickly captures your attention. It's easy to pick up and put down, which means it's not very complicated. I do wish there were a little more to it, but it is simple fun and most people would enjoy that.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|As a man I had to see what all the hype was about, lol.  The book simply reminded me to keep thinking outside the box when it comes to &#34;special time,&#34; because based on the books popularity, woman are into more than they let on, lol.
B000VH5BEC|4.0|I received all the star trek next generations on vhs--two huge boxes--they were all new & unopened, as described. some of them were defective when played, but no complaints, I realize that they were about 20 yrs old! most of them play perfectly, so thanks for the very good deal!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I thought that the book was very Interesting. I liked the characters a lot because instead of Greek gods like in the Percy Jackson series he used Egyptian gods.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|A great historical perspective  on a single topic and how it changed the world.  It left me with the ability to say &#34;that's where that came from&#34;.....<br /><br />Oh to be an Epicurean.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|I paid $1.99 for this app. The video showed colors available and the ability to change the amount of dots. I have dots ONLY. No pop up or a menu.  MY grandson feels ripped off as do I. Fix this!!!!!!!!!!! Then we will give a better rateing.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie is awesome! The performances by all the cast are wonderful and the songs are well done by all! Love this movie!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|I love the blu-ray as always.  Denzel has another great movie and the only way to watch is on blu-ray.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Enjoyed this very much! Great performance! A must for every Adele fan! What a voice!! She is a totally awesome performer!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The story line is interesting, but the sex scenes are getting redundant.  OK, he has a huge c_ _ k, we get it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Awesome CD! Adele at her best! Such a talent for a debut album! All Adele fans will greatly enjoy this CD!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like escape games, and this one was just challenging enough to be interesting without making me beat my head into the wall
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We have loved the stage play for years but the performances in this movie are awesome! All the actors did a fantastic job!
B00000J631|3.0|It's okay. That's about it. Can't get a good sampling with 30 seconds. Should have been 60 seconds at least.
B009X01C64|5.0|I have not had any problems with the case and it works great I love the way you can rotate the kindle for horizontal are vertical viewing. It does a great job of keeping the kindle safe
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The story is compelling, and the end, stunning. It is a valuable and calming tome. It requires a leisurely read.
B007SGM084|4.0|As someone in a review I read said, once you read [these books] you can't get them out of your head.  Now my chore is to replace what's in my mind with something of a different genre - something that is healthier for my mind.  I<br /><br />In case you are interested, I never intended to read Fifty Shades of Grey (and did not know there were two other books about Christian and Ana) because it is not the type of book I usually read and enjoy .  I read either mystery books or books with wholesome or religious content.  As a Christian I believe I should watch what I put in my mind - this book has proved the importance of that.<br /><br />Then came last summer (2012).  I was asked by the mother of one of the boys on my grandson's baseball team if I had read Fifty Shades of Grey when she noticed that I routinely had my Kindle during Drew's games.  I told her no and she turned to my daughter and asked her if she thought it was something I would like.  My daughter immediately told her no, that I would not enjoy it. (Come to find out my daughter did not even read the entire first book.)  I did not think anything else about the book . . .<br /><br />Then, less than a month ago (late June 2013), the woman with whom I work asked me if I had read it.  I told her no and she told me it was a great story.  She agreed to loan me her book and told me that the underlying story was very good - if you could get past the sexual content.  She brought the book to me on Thursday.  I started reading it after I got home from work.<br /><br />In addition to working full time and spending my weekends watching my grandson play baseball and going to church, I read until late Thursday (and I mean until 1:00 a.m. - and had to get up and go to work), until 2:00 a.m. Friday, and Saturday until 3:00 a.m. - and got up and was at the 8:00 service at church.  I sent my co-worker a text and asked her to bring me book 2 - however, I found myself unable to wait until Monday evening to start reading the nextbook, so I bought the trilogy on my Kindle and started on Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />Let me state right now that I could do without so many graphic sexual descriptions and the awful language.  Also, I can't imagine anyone with a life involving work & work trips, social engagements, family, and ex-partners having time to engage in the unbelievable number and types of sexual encounters as do Ana and Christian.<br /><br />That being said, since the time I was loaned the first book, I have read all three books 5 times. The underlying story was, in my opinion, a very good story.  There were places in the book that were extremely funny (I read the part about \\"Wanda\\" having belonged to Jose's mother, her mother, and her mother to my 13 year old granddaughter since I drive a car older than my granddaughter and I knew she would think that was funny too), and the repartee between Ana and Christian fun.<br /><br />Unless I can find a replacement for this series, I will probably read it again.<br /><br />FYI: I am a 71 year old woman who hasn't read a \\"best seller\\" not written by a Christian author in at least 40 years.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|Just the latest re-view of this classic. The philosophy or story is not for everyone, but over the years has been a touchstone.
B009JBZH54|5.0|First off - the product itself and packaging. This is a very nice set, the quality of it is top-notch and the art book is a nice bonus. The outer box that holds everything even has a nice feel to it. They need to make more sets like this, a lot of people could learn from this set. The 5 discs are nicely contained and kept safe in their own fold out style book, and easy to remove when needed. Not much more to say about it really, just very nice set especially for the price.<br /><br />Not going to get too much into the movie because chances are if you are here looking to buy this you have seen them or know something about the movies already. I will keep it short...the movies are well done, the Blu-ray quality is up there and if you are even a remote fan of comic style movies this is a must see/own collection.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Funny, easy read. No need to be familiar with Tina Fey to enjoy. Autobiographical adventures combined with the anxious rants of an adult trying to do it all, be it all, and have it all.  First jobs, Christmas with the in-laws, traveling disasters, taken seriously in the workplace, there is something we can all relate to in life.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I am enjoying this game. Challenging but yet easy to use. Nice colors and nice sound when you press a tile. Makes you use your mind quickly.
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV new-year's eve 2011.  The action, stunts, acrobatics, and plot were complex and fast moving so I NEEDED to view it again,and again.  So now I want to see the OTHER &#34;Bourne&#34; dramas!  Also the recent blockbuster film &#34;The Fast and Furious&#34; was similar in plot but seemed very EXCESSIVE in violence, noise and mayhem.  Bourne Ultimatum is a far more intelligent and well filmed action movie I think.
1600247245|5.0|As with most of the Harry Bosch series, it grabbed my attention from start to finish.  I feel as though I know this character and all he has endured during his life as a detective.  Michael Connelly remains one of my all--time favorite authors.
1400169178|4.0|having been through cancer twice, I had a broad knowledge of some of the science presented here.  the case studies are interesting. the absolute tenacity and &#34;intelligence&#34; of this disease as described in this book is mind boggling!  this definitely leaves the reader (or listener) with the knowledge that cancer will never be eradicated, only managed.
B00DIJ49UW|4.0|The Soundtrack is pretty good for keeping you awake while performing mundane tasks.  But I am very disappointed at the lack of vocals.<br /><br />THIS IS A PURELY MUSICAL SCORE！ （except for some Russian chorus)<br /><br />IMDB lists the end credits songs:<br />\\"Just Like Your Tenderness\\"<br />Written by Liang Hong Zhi<br />Executive Produced by Ivy Wang and Mathew D<br />Performed by Luo Xiaoxuan<br />Courtesy of R2G Music/Coden Music<br /><br />\\"Drift\\"<br />Written by Blake Perlman, RZA and Ramin Djawadi<br />Produced by RZA and Ramin Djawadi<br />Performed by Blake Perlman featuring RZA<br /><br />I couldn't careless for Drift, but I was absolutely mesmerized by Just Like Your Tenderness during both times I went to see the movie.  Guess what?  Neither of them are included on this \\"soundtrack\\".<br /><br />Granted, the Amazon product description lists 25 titles and apparently it's not there, I thought it was an omission and ordered anyway.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I loved how the story line is always changing and emily is constantly growing as a character. I love this show!!!!!
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This movie is all you might want for a mindless escape with old and new action stars, including the old reliables like Chuck Norris,  and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun to play kinda takes too long but it's okay I guess they could up date so u earn more coin
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very creepy book that starts off happy and disintegrates into twisted personalities.  The ending could go either way.  Watch out nick!
B000YJ54DU|2.0|Too much fluff and too long to get to the story. It wasted a lot of my time. I hope the next one is better.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This amazing story kept me reading through all five books, despite my frustration with the writing in Books 4 and 5. Books 4 and 5 both need one more major edit to cut out a lot of needless detail that didn't contribute anything to the plot. I understand the ending, but I think it's a cop out (no spoilers here, though!). I'm rather miffed that so many new characters were introduced (in tremendous, laborious detail) but then I got no &#34;closure&#34; with several characters that I was attached to. Regardless, I'll be keeping an eye out for Book 6 so I can spend another $15 in the hopes of finding out what happens next. Hopefully HBO will redeem the ending and give these amazing characters the ends they deserve (or, as we've come to expect in the game of thrones, an extremely unfair and bloody one).
0061733199|5.0|All kinds of stuff in here, too advanced for young boys, but plenty of fun practical stuff that even I enjoyed.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved Stieg Larsson's first two books and this one was just as good.  I wish his life had not ended so suddenly I would have loved to have read all of the books he planned to write.
B002PNER9U|5.0|This was a wonderful musical.  Good acting made you identify with the charactershe songa are memorable and catchy.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoys musicals.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I was a little worried that the only reason I liked this movie as much as I did was the HFR 3D. It was shot in that format and was by far the most immersive movie going experience I've ever had at the theater! But it is just as enjoyable at home on my HDTV in good old fashioned 2D 1080p. Really looking forward to 2 & 3!
B0000256VK|5.0|Great listening cd.  Older music. I enjoy Roxy Music<br />as a nice change to listen to.  I would recommend this<br />cd
B00D3J2QKW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Incredibly well written & practical.  It doesn't disappoint.  Great reminder of just how to sort out what is important in your life.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|This is not on the top of my greatest listening list,<br />but I do enjoy the Alan Parsons Project.  I would<br />recommend this as good listening music
0525478817|5.0|John Green strikes again with the feels.This is by far one of my favorite books. It's a young adult/teen book, but people of all ages will enjoy this book.
0060574216|5.0|Every married couple needs some help now and then and this book provides easy to understand insights and suggestions.  I've found it helpful at home and at work.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseni is a wonderful writer, bringing life and emotions to his characters, giving the reader a taste of the Afghani culture. As with Kite runner I did not want this book to end. He wove the many characters into a cohesive web of intertwined lives that meandered from one to another effortlessly
0395389496|3.0|I was extremely disappointed to find the jacket had a small tear, the special seal was bent, and the last few pages in the book had small stains (appears as if they were smeared drops of hot chocolate). I was going to give as part of a baby shower gift but decided against it because it doesn't appear new. :(  On a positive note, I was pleasantly surprised to discover the author's autograph & a CD.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Although this movie was in French the acting was so superb and the subtitles added the needed information.  I have enjoyed this movie over and over.  I have shared it with many friends and they like it very much as well.
B004I9CXHW|4.0|Plugged in and fit the car great. I plugged several devices (phones and USB drives) and they all worked well. Charging seems slower than the my normal car charger but works fine (which I'm sure is the cars issue not the cables). Only complaint is the USB port is shallow and thus the connection to the device seems loose and the devices seem to come disconnected a little too easily. However hasn't really affect the use of the cable and for the money you save over the official VW cable ($45+) it's not worth complaining about. Plus, I don't have an official VW cable so it might be the same way.
B00004XPPC|5.0|This is a classic and takes me back to when my parents took me to see it.  I love this movie and the story it tells.  Wish there were more like it!
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|You will want to listen to this one over and over again the more I listened to it the better it got... and it started out great!
B008AIGWVA|1.0|It does not work on kindle you can't talk to him and he won't respond and none of the talking apps work but I do like the explosions
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Ok, the product is great and it makes using the GoPro much easier.  It has a touch interface, so major plus.  However, I have a bone to pick with the GoPro folks.  Most cameras  have a LCD build in.  These guys decided to slice up the camera and then nickle and dime you to death.  I could understand if the camera was cheaper because it didn't come with a LCD, but its not.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|It's a time-pass movie. Not bad for a rental. Amazon was running slow that night (for some odd-reason) and the movie quality kept switching from SD to HD.
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|While the paint and quality of the toys is really good, their heads pop off at the slightest glance(they even fell off in the package).  I've read bad reviews on how well they interact with the talking castle, so I have not bought it.  Save your money until this set drops in price(maybe around the $10 price point).  And buy some glue!
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|Recommended to anyone who love's the real music. It's for all. Folk's call it southern rock..I just call it some fine music..
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I expected excellence and I got it.  I have been fortunate to have seen four of the shows featured in the movie and I was transported back to those experiences.  Everyone who loves Cirque should buy this movie.
B004AHNIGM|3.0|I just expected something more I suppose. This is kind of generic. be nice if he got a bit more into it. Voice is good as always. What would be nice is if he got into the guitar with ???
0316067598|5.0|I read lots of SF books, this one was the best by far...really makes you think about what is going on and just how insane the entire outcome was.  A great read
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Awesome. Picks up food easily off Restaurant floor. Battery stays charged up to an hour of use. Love this item.
055358202X|2.0|I loved the first 2 books!  The 3rd book I started to feel uninterested in some of the characters!  In book 4 I don't care about many of the characters and am having a very difficult time getting through the book.  It is very boring at times and the chapters seem to drag on.....I keep checking to see how many pages are left so I can go onto something else to read.  Taking a long break from the series after this book.  Can barely keep my eyes opened while reading.  I might just watch the show and be done withe the books al together!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something comedic or romantic or dramatic to read.
B002AWX6UM|4.0|Unbelievable what theses young children have to live through and try to recover from. Inspiring story and brings hope to readers
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The book was really good it took a little while to pick up but once it did it didn't stop
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Fit is great. Provides good protection.<br />The cover works well as a stand to watch video.<br />I would buy again.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I've tried a bunch of apps but this one kills them all. I felt like a real Dj Using it. The sound effects are amazing and best of all u get to record your mixes and listen to them.. Love the app and there is no way it can get better. I recommend this app
0061122416|5.0|Though the read is very quick and so many things are obvious, it is a charming story of, what I call, Life. The obvious rules of life, such as being kind to others, trust, care, are all rolled into a story of a youth searching for and, ultimately, attaining his dreams. Never give up is the message here. In today's confusing and difficult atmpsphere, this is a &#34;feel good&#34; and charming book. Loved it.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan has written an exhaustively thoughtful history of the life and times that surrounded the historical Jesus of Nazareth as he came of age in ancient Israel. By bringing the history of the politics of Jerusalem, the Temple, and Rome into bright focus, he creates an extraordinary picture of the world that created many Messianic prophets, and one who would later become the center of the Christian church.<br /><br />Always respectful of faith, Aslan nevertheless keeps his focus on history. The way he explains the historical Jesus in context is illuminating. He brings a new, richer perspective on what kind of life a Galilean carpenter would have had in the time period, shows the threads of a growing movement of discontented young men in conflict with an entrenched elite.<br /><br />Especially fascinating was the reconstruction of what the laws and political structure were like, opposed to the softening of Jesus' message by the writers of the gospels later. Noting that they were written after the Massacre of Jerusalem, the refining of Jesus' message in reaction to that is nothing short of fascinating.<br /><br />This book is compulsively readable, impeccably researched, and a brilliant addition to the canon of research on the historical Jesus. A must have.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|This book deserves 5 stars because it captured a horrific time in Nigerian history in a beautiful and descriptive way. Gut wrenching at times but warm and deep with emotion other times. I loved it and recommend it to anyone interested in not only learning about the  human experience during the Biafra- Nigeria war but to anyone who wants too feel alive and grateful.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great fun to watch stars of the Baby boom era having such a great time with a retirement story. Loved it.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Love the graphics and good challenges . Lots of fun to get the bad pigs just keep pictureing blowing  away my boss!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is just one of those books that had to be made into a movie and it was made well.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|Lots of fun to challenge other  people and to beat your top score. Enjoyed seeing other people's scores  to beat.
B00AAQWZWU|5.0|I have been a fan of Eros since I was in 5th grade. My mom grew up with his music in Ecuador and once I started learning Italian in 6th grade, I absolutely fell in love with his Italian music. Noi is filled with great lyrics and passion that are clearly audible by Eros' voice. \\"Un Angelo Disteso Al Sole\\" is one of my favorite songs of this album as well as the emotional \\"Infinitamente.\\" Overall, this album will not disappoint!
B009KUWWW0|5.0|I read this book shortly after reading \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" .  It took me a little longer to get into this one than the other, but I eventually got to the point where it was hard to put down. The story was as compelling as Pillars, and I truly enjoyed it. The ending was good but still leaves me wanting a little more. I want to get the DVD now and get to see the people and settings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun. sometimes freezes on kindle fire... but not often. have played on android phone but more fun on the tablet
B0055S348W|4.0|Now I can and it was super easy to install and also easy to use.  I would recommend this app.  Thanks!
B00AGDY4AI|5.0|Course I'm not a good one to ask, when it comes to John Wayne.  To me he is the ultimate American.  You can't help but laugh during this movie, the chemistry be between him and Maureen O'Hara is unbelievable.  This is my ALL TIME favorite movie.  Anytime  I watch this movie I grab the popcorn and blanket.  Life is good - what more could a girl want? John Wayne, salt, and warmth, cept maybe wine?
B000P407K4|5.0|This has to be the best black comedy ever made. The movie may be from 1964 but it is just as funny today. George C Scott gives the performance of his career.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very addicted and makes you think. Will play again.  Liked it a lot cant wait for more games like it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've watched this series from the beginning , it's marvelous. I really like British . And I love history and that period of time . It would be grand to visit England
1439153663|4.0|Loved the book.  It's well written and a touching story of love and strife in the South.  I put this book right up there with &#34;The Help.&#34;
B003WKOTXE|5.0|This movie is cute. No narration. It's cool to see how babies from all over grow up. Not very rewatchable but definitely worth the initial money we spent.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I read all three of these books and found them to be a good read.  I would recommend reading it.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|This product looks like every other charger on the planet, except when you plug a phone into it, it does NOTHING. Oh well. I'll order another one. From someone else...
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I felt that this was a good book, but the time sequences were rather hard to follow and piece together.  I do like Hosseini's way of storytelling, but in this particular novel, it seemed to be a bit disjointed.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|My 6 yr old granddaughter loved it - she watched it multiple times. It is her favorite movie. She connects with Matilda's spunk and smarts.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Been without a phone all week, and the Alarm Clock Xtreme is great for getting me up for work on time!
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Historically inaccurate in part but still a great story and an even better love story. I would watch it again.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have tried several weather apps and this one is the most accurate for weather predicting. It is also well designed for ease of use and an attractive  layout. I like it a lot better than Accuweather.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|A lot of fun playing against my Facebook friends. Took a little bit to set up and get my friends on my list, but worth it!!!
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|I don't Want to, it shouldn't be a requirement. I said all I needed to say above ok alright good
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there were more rooms...Fun and addictive!<br />Like how each puzzle work together...some pretty tricky.<br />Can't wait for more to come.<br /><br />Llanford@cox.net
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A very fun, addicting game! Challenging enough to be enjoyable &amp; to feel a sense of accomplishment, but easy enough to not get too frustrated. Love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is a great game! It just needs a bigger world.The actual nether . And The Sun and the moon. other than that it is awesome
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg this game is so fun you need to get this app if you like temple run you will love this game I can not stop playing it
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|My kids and I thourghly enjoyed this movie.  A little spooky, but not so bad they couldn't get over it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really fun game reccomend it to anyone fun for children Linda like temple run but still fun!!! hope review helped!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Can you imagine risking your life in order to read?  No?  Well, that's what Liesel does in The Book Thief.  I love reading so much, sometimes I wonder if I would risk my life to get books, if all of my books were burned or banned.<br /><br />This is a dark story, told from the point of view of Death, set in Germany before and during World War II.  Liesel steals a book before she even knows how to read, and her foster father teaches her how to read from The Gravedigger's Handbook.  Imagine that kind of subject matter and content being your first book!  Liesel goes on to keep stealing books, namely from the mayor's wife, who is aware of Liesel's theft but does not turn her in.<br /><br />Liesel's most important relationship in the book, in my opinion, is with Max Vanderberg, a Jewish fistfighter who hides out in Liesel's foster parents' basement.  He shares Liesel's love of reading and even makes her two illustrated books about his life story.  The Book Thief is a moving, touching story about living in Germany during World War II, but mostly it is about a young woman rebelling against the German regime.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />It is a sad book, and very dark.  How could it not be---being about Germany during World War II?  The fact that Death is the narrator is another contributing factor to the darkness.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />Liesel's triumph over her circumstances.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|love. it. it is cool.and good. and fun. good game. but it is not free. but I love it so much
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Every once in a while, I'm reading a book I really like and I do something bad: I cheat.  I get to where I know I won't have the time to finish the book that day, and I want to know the ending so badly I just can't wait, so I skip ahead and read the end of the book.  I know, I know, it's a terrible thing to do!<br /><br />I got 180 pages in to Before I Go To Sleep (over halfway through) and I just had to know how the story ended.  I knew my baby was going to wake up from her nap soon, and I also knew I couldn't wait until the next day to find out what happens to Christine.  So, I skipped ahead 150 pages and read the last 40 pages of the book.  And all I can say is that I really cheated myself.  Now that I know what happens, I'm not going to go back and read what I skipped, and I really missed out.  This book was so good...such a great psychological thriller.  It kept me guessing the whole way through.<br /><br />The book alternates between Christine's present day life and her journal entries.  This alternation keeps the story moving quickly, even though there is a slightly frustrating (for the reader, and especially for Christine) \\"Groundhog Day\\" effect with how Christine wakes up every morning with no memory.  She has to learn that she is in her forties and married every single day.  She doesn't know her husband most days and feels totally alone and lost.  This premise was so unique and so well-executed, it made for a great read.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to just about anyone.  Just don't get impatient and cheat yourself out of a great read like I did!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I wasn't sure to get this app but I did and it's so cool I'm glad I got this app
0545123291|4.0|I just finished Linger and I am shocked at how much I enjoyed it.  It was a great sequel, more enticing than Shiver, with better pacing, a well fleshed-out plot, better character development, and an ending that sets up Forever (book three) perfectly.  Shiver dealt with Sam trying not to shift, and Linger goes more into the science/reasons behind shifting.  I really liked that!<br /><br />I love Maggie Stiefvater's writing.  It has been described as lyrical, and I have to agree.  She writes from the heart, and I love the way she describes her characters' emotions, desires, and secrets.  I also really enjoyed the way the book is told from four different points of view, but all in the first person.<br /><br />There is a pretty surprising twist at the end, which I loved.  One character has to make a big decision, and I expected them to decide opposite of what they actually did.  But, what they actually decided was more in keeping with their character and in line with what they value the most (humanity), so it was totally appropriate, albeit heart-wrenching.  I'm trying not to give anything away here!<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />Like Shiver, Linger was a little slow to take off.  But after 150 pages, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />Shiver was almost more of a world-building novel, and Linger had more intrigue.  I liked the addition of Cole, and the twist at the end.  I won't say more because I don't want to give anything away.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Fun movie with an unexpected twist. Nice and clean something you don't see anymore. Would recommend this movie to anyone.
1455508977|3.0|Nicholas Sparks' books have been hit and miss for me for a few years now, with more misses than hits.  They are just all so similar, I feel like I'm reading the same story over and over again! My mom saw The Lucky One in Wal-Mart, and because it has a new cover, she thought it was a new release and bought it.  And then she let me read it first so I could tell her if she would like it or not.<br /><br />The funny thing is that this was my second time reading The Lucky One, but I didn't realize I'd read the book before until the very end of the story.  The scene where all three main characters are running through the woods in the rain is what made me remember that I had actually already read The Lucky One, closer to its original release date.  For me, the fact that I couldn't even remember that I'd already read The Lucky One tells me that this book is easily forgotten.<br /><br />The setting felt recycled to me, and the characters behaved predictably.  Elizabeth and Logan fell in love too fast for my liking.  My other main complaint was the epilogue.  It felt forced to me, like Sparks was trying to be suspenseful but the not knowing who had actually died made me mad.  I sped my way through the epilogue, trying to figure out if this was going to be a HEA or one of Sparks' few sad endings.<br /><br />I liked The Lucky One, but didn't love it.  I'm not sorry that I read it, but I am glad that I didn't buy it.  I enjoy the writing style and the emotions but Sparks needs to start changing things up as far as plots and settings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. It is so much fun to play and I am so good. You should buy it for kids and adults can enjoy. I LOVE IT!!!!!!
0545259088|4.0|The story we fell in love with during Shiver and Linger has finally concluded.  Stiefvater keeps us guessing up to the last minute as to what's going to happen.  Will Sam and Grace get to stay together?  Will Cole let himself love?  What about Isabel and her bloodthirsty father?  Will Grace's parents ever get a grip?  What about Beck and Sam's twisted relationship and Olivia's newfound wolf-hood?  These are all questions addressed in Forever.  Notice I said 'addressed.'  I'm not saying if they all get answered or not.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has such a unique writing style.  When I'm in the mood to read one of her books (which I of course was for Forever), I really enjoy it.  Her books are meant to be savored slowly.  The lyrical writing abounds, along with lots of poetry: found in Sam's chapters, of course.  Sam is the most well-read young man I have ever encountered.  I have to admit that all of the poetry Stiefvater includes in her books makes me feel like an uneducated country bumpkin.  I'm no fan of poetry, so I can't always perceive the depth Stiefvater tries to achieve with her poetry.  I do appreciate a well-read character, though, even one with a taste for poetry that I don't always understand.<br /><br />One thing that I really like about The Wolves of Mercy Falls series is the alternating points of view.  It keeps the story moving so quickly, and makes me want to keep reading long past the point I said I'd stop.  I just love a first-person narration!  Forever explores the depth of Sam and Grace's love, but even more, it explores the bond between parent and child.  I loved that!<br /><br />Forever loses stars for two reasons.  The first is that the ending felt rushed and the second I will not reveal because it would spoil the book.  Once I got over the red print (seriously, WHY?) I really enjoyed the book.  However, my complaints were too great for me to give Forever five stars.  Upon closing the cover, I felt simultaneously happy and sad.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you like historical novels, I'd highly recommend this book.  While I loved The Kite Runner (by the same author), I didn't think his second book was nearly as good (perhaps too much pressure to come out with a second after such a hit with Kite Runner?) so I was a little suspect with this one.  However, it was a compelling story line and well-written.
0316154687|5.0|I love David Sedaris.  I've read four of his books now and loved each one more than the last.  Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is my favorite, with When You Are Engulfed in Flames coming in a close second.<br /><br />The stories are meandering at times, but hilarious.  They go in directions you don't expect, which makes them all the funnier.  The things Sedaris goes through and the way he describes them are what makes his writing so successful---where the rest of us might bemoan our circumstances or childhoods, he turns his painful memories into something we want to read.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />Some of the chapters drag in the middle a little.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The humor---Sedaris' books make me laugh out loud frequently and when I think back on parts of the book, I giggle, even months later.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I just LOVED Pollyanna and couldn't put it down. What a brilliant story, uplifting and inspiring. Eleanor Porter is a brilliant author bringing the story of Miss Pollyanna alive.
0545123275|3.0|Shiver...a great choice for Twilight's Team Jacob fans.  If you liked reading about the werewolves in The Twilight Series, then Shiver is for you.  This book made me cold while reading it---I had to drink hot chocolate to warm up because Stiefvater focuses so much on the temperature!<br /><br />This was a good story, a little simple, but still good. All of the elements of a good YA story are included here:  absentee parents, willful female protagonist, emotional/over-protective love interest, danger, and little bit of self-discovery along the way.  There are some definite rip-off scenes from Twilight in my opinion, namely the woods/meadow scene.  If you can get past that, you'll enjoy Shiver.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />The \\"cure\\" is pretty implausible if you ask me.  I won't say more because you know I HATE spoilers!<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />We don't have to wait for thousands of pages and multiple books (I'm talking about you, Stephenie Meyer) for the relationship to move \\"to the next level\\", if you know what I mean...it's decided and done with no regrets or hemming and hawing.  Go Grace!<br /><br />SECOND OPINION REVIEW: (written after reading Shiver a second time)<br /><br />Things I like about Shiver:<br />I like the way Stiefvater describes places and feelings.<br />I like Sam.  He struggles with racing thoughts, insomnia, and not living in the present moment.  As these are all things that I deal with too, they make Sam endearing to me.<br />I like the ending.<br />I like the little bits of song and poetry that Sam is constantly making up in his head as a coping mechanism to dealing with his feelings.<br />The writing feels more intelligent than other YA books.  I like the writing so much that I bought Stiefvater's two faerie books.<br /><br />Things I don't like about Shiver:<br />I understand and accept that when you are reading a work of fiction you have to suspend reality.  While I'm not a big fan of love at first sight, I do think that attraction or a feeling of some level of connection at first sight is pretty plausible.  I take umbrage to a character falling in love with a wolf when she is eleven years old and doesn't even know that he is more than a wolf.  That has a big \\"ew\\" factor.  I know that this is a fact because Grace admits it to it.  As my insightful husband opined, \\"it's almost as bad as a teenager falling in love with a baby.\\"  (Referring to Jacob imprinting with Reneesme in Breaking Dawn)<br />The plot floats on by with all of the excitement of an Enya song.  I think I would have rated Shiver higher if there was more excitement to it.  It didn't start to pick up until the last 100 pages.<br />It felt very \\"Team Jacob\\" to me.  As I am staunchly Team Edward, this was a turn-off.<br />The script in the book is midnight blue.  It looks black at first glance but a few pages in I noticed that the script was light and I was struggling to see it clearly.nk that attraction or a feeling of some level of connection at first sight is pretty plausible.

142314189X|4.0|This was a great series, appropriate for children as well as young adults.  Books written from a young boy's point of view aren't my personal favorite, but I enjoyed this series nonetheless.  The imagery is great, there is some well-placed humor, especially from Percy's friends Grover and Tyson, and each book's plot is very fast-paced.  I like how Riordan weaves the real and surreal worlds together.  I haven't thought much about Greek mythology since middle school, but the Percy Jackson series is Greek mythology come to life.  Fans of Gregor the Overlander, Cirque du Freak, Tyger Tyger and Scott Westerfeld will enjoy this series.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />They are really more childrens' lit than YA books.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The personification of Greek mythology is excellently done.

0062009540|2.0|I wish this series had been out when I was in middle and high school.  I would have really enjoyed them back then.  Pretty Little Liars is a light-hearted read about four rich mean girls and the secrets they are all keeping.  They used to be a group of five, until one girl disappeared three years earlier.  The remaining friends have gone their separate ways but are haunted by the disappearance of Alison and the secrets only Alison knew about each one of them.  The book is written simply but well; however, I found the content lacking for my tastes.  I would recommend Pretty Little Liars for a younger audience.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />I don't really like reading about 16-year old mean girls .  I already lived through that in high school and don't want to remember!<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />I liked how \\"A\\" put such extreme fear into said mean girls.  I also liked that one of the side characters was named Toby, which is my husband's name.

0142419400|3.0|I've read nothing but glowing reviews of Anna and the French Kiss, so I was really excited to see that my library had a copy and I anxiously awaited my turn to borrow it.  Once I had the book in my hands, I dove right in, expecting to be blown away.  However, my expectations were a little too high.<br /><br />Remember that movie, Ten Things I Hate About You?  Do you remember when Bianca tells her friend, \\"I know the difference between like and love.  I like my Skechers, but I love my Prada backpack?\\"  That's exactly how I felt reading this book.  While I did like Anna and the French Kiss, I didn't love it.<br /><br />I just realized what the problem may have been.  I have a hard time giving over-hyped books a fair chance.  I prefer to read a book and decide for myself how I feel before I read a lot of other reviews about it.  I prefer a kind of a 'blank-slate' effect.  When I've read too many positive reviews, I build the book up so much in my mind, thinking I'm in store for another stalker-worthy read, that the book can never meet my expectations.  That's what happened here.  Anna and the French Kiss has been out almost six months, meaning I've read six months of glowing reviews, fully expecting to finish the book and rave about it along with everyone else.<br /><br />Anyway, back to Anna and the French Kiss.  I loved the chemistry between Etienne and Anna, but the middle of the book was repetitive.  There was just so much back and forth between them, it got old for me.  Also, Anna felt immature to me---and by that, I mean more immature than other YA heroines.  She held others to a high standard of behavior but relaxed that standard when it got in the way of what she wanted.  Another problem was the fact that the book is written in the present tense.  I don't like reading books in the present tense.  The writing feels awkward and doesn't flow for me.  The conflict resolution came too quickly.  I would have liked to have a more fully fleshed-out ending.<br /><br />On to what I liked.  I loved reading about Paris (although I got sick of Anna complaining about being there).  Etienne's tour of Paris was one of my favorite parts of the book.  I liked the writing style, the characterization, and the chemistry between Anna and Etienne.  I liked that there was some (much-needed) character growth.  I closed the cover liking the book okay, but not loving it and not wanting to ever read it again.  I promptly forgot about the characters---the hallmark of a less-than-stellar book for me, and am left feeling mildly disappointed.n to what I liked.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this twisted book.  I didn't want to put it down.  There were so many surprises.  However, I hated the way it ended.  Such a good book for it to end the way it did.

B009NY43NY|5.0|A long time Sookie fan, it was hard to let go. I wish there was another series to continue with the legacy but it is done, it is over. The ending seemed a little rushed but overall the loose ends are tied and the story is at its end. Much better plot than the other books before, so sad to see Sookie go but it was great while it lasted.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This version of the Lincoln story is not your grandfathers version. I've seen the one made back in the 30's or 40's with the heroic poses and voices and that is a fine rendition but this version looks to me more real life. I'm no movie critic but I did like this movie - a lot.
0307352153|4.0|not as good as I had hoped but interesting just the same.<br />thank you for the pseedy delivery.<br />appreciate a different perspective and take
B004MYF4SS|5.0|I will dive straight into number two of this series. If you are thinking of getting this book -  then do. The story builds slowly but with very good reasons. But my word it makes all good sense as the book builds to its climax The writer intertwines the past with the present in a way that doesn't annoy you as some books can when it seems that they are going off track.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I really like this incarnation of Bond that is in these last three movies! He looks absolutely nothing like Ian Fleming's character and behaves out of character for both films and books. But that is what I like. He is a different shade of Bond.<br />Skyfall is a beautifully done action film with great action and perfomances all the way around. I recommend that Bond fans add this to your collection and that those new to Bond enjoy this and realize how much more there is to the rich history of Bond on film and books.<br />The Bluray transfer is excellent and the film it self is an action packed adventure that will not dissappoint.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it becauce you meet people. and make friends. you get to help animals .you get to make and name a village.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy playing Diamond Dash. It keeps your mind thinking. Diamond Dash is a matching game. I know that sounds easy, but it is not always that easy. There is a 60 second time limit,which goes pretty fast. I believe people of all age would enjoy this game,so come and give it a try.

B0023SDPS6|5.0|I only found out about this from the Longmire show.  This book contained the thread about the girl who had been raped by the three white kids who received light sentances  and were being killed, apparently for revenge. although there is a lot more in the book and it will be interesting to see how things work out with the show and the book,  one character that it looks like they will be keeping n the show dies in this book.  The setup and characters are very close to the show, which i found only because katie sattee (sp?) from battlestar galactica was in it.  Its a great show and i went and immediately bought book 2 when i finished reading this.  The character sheriff Longmire in the book and the show is in a complex position, in a white vs cheyenne polarized community and having to find a way to achieve justice while nearly everyone has their own private adgenda he has to edit through.  I'm sure i'll read my way through the entire series.

0312430000|5.0|Routine errors are frequently caused by little things that slip through the cracks due to poor communication and distractions.  A simple checklist can eliminate these oversights.  This book explores how checklists can improve quality and efficiency -- and even save lives -- in a wide range of industries.  Given the crisis with health care affordability in the United States, I am impressed with the dramatic cost savings in the medical examples.<br /><br />In a hospital, \\"line infections are so common that they are considered a routine complication.\\" Dr. Peter Provonost of Johns Hopkins (author of [[ASIN:B0057D9R2M Safe Patients, Smart Hospitals: How One Doctor's Checklist Can Help Us Change Health Care from the Inside Out]]) created a checklist to address this problem. \\"For a year afterward... the ten-day line-infection rate went from 11 percent to zero.\\" Based on this success, more checklists were created in the Johns Hopkins ICU. Later, Provonost was asked to implement his checklist in ICUs throughout the state of Michigan.<br /><br />Dr. Atul Gawande (the author) was invited to join a World Health Organization task force to improve the safety of surgery around the world.  As you might guess, the result is the WHO Safe Surgery Checklist.<br /><br />He visited Boeing to learn how checklists are developed in the aviation industry. The book also includes examples of how a financial firm uses checklists for investment due diligence and how a restaurant uses checklists to ensure accuracy and quality of orders. There is an interesting chapter about how skyscrapers are built, but I think this is a weak example of the book's thesis.  The comprehensive scheduling system used to coordinate all of the tasks to be performed by numerous contractors sounds like a project management system (Gannt charts, critical path, etc.) -- not a checklist. Throughout the book we learn that an effective checklist is kept short and includes only the most vital points.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent book which shows how simple steps can improve performance in a variety of complex fields.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I remember reading this as a kid.  When the movie came out it was wonderful and I watched it on TV again and again.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I don't own every Metal Gear Solid game, but I've played them (except Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2). This is the perfect bundle of joy for me. I'm also glad I waited and didn't get the HD collection :)  Anyways let's get started:<br /><br />Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection comes with 8 games!<br /><br />1. The original Metal Gear*<br />2. The original Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake*<br />*Can be found on the main menu of MGS3: Subsistence<br /><br />3. Metal Gear Solid**<br />4. Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions**<br />**Downloadable from Playstation Store as PSone Classics via online vouchers included inside the game box.<br /><br />5. Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (Substance version)<br />6. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (Subsistence version)<br />7. Metal Gear Solid: Peacewalker<br />8. Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots<br /><br />MGS 2, 3, and Peacewalker have all been remade in HD and are PS3 remakes.<br />The Legacy Collection comes with 2 discs:<br /><br />Disc 1: Metal Gear Solid 4. That's it.<br /><br />Disc 2: Comes with MGS2, MGS3, MGS Peacewalker, and the two digital graphic novels - MGS Bande Desinee/MGS2 Bande Desinee. These graphic novels are accessible under the 'Video' section of the XMB menu with Disc 2 in the PS3.<br /><br />You also get this 100 page artbook which features loads of promotional artwork from all the games in this collection and extra promotional artwork from the HD collection and the 25 year anniversary. It's just about the same size as the game case. Some people complained about the artwork, but it's SUPPOSED to be promotional. All the artwork in this book will either be advertisements promoting the game or some type of promotional poster. I liked it.<br /><br />I also see people complaining that we're only getting downloadable copies of MGS1 and MGS: VR Missions and not the original disc copy. The main two reasons people are upset over this are because<br />1. This means they can't play it and then resell it.<br />2. It'd be nice to have the original disc copy for collection purposes.<br /><br />I don't really care that we're only getting downloadable versions. I wasn't ever planning on selling them anyways, and I'm not a collector. As long as I can play it I'm happy.<br /><br />Some people were confused about the two graphic novels so I'll explain. There was originally a game on PSP called Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel. In some MGS DVD thing that was only released in Japan, they remade the PSP game, but took out the interactivity of the game and basically made it a graphic novel movie thing. It was released as Metal Gear Solid: Bande Desinee, and it's basically a comic-graphic novel-esque representation of the events that occurred in MGS1. They also made a second one called Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Desinee, which has the same comic-graphic novel-esque style, but it's a representation of the events that occurred in MGS2: SoL. This 2nd one was only on DVD though, there wasn't an interactive game version of it. Anyways, these two movies, remade in HD and once exclusive to Japan are what you're getting with this collection.<br /><br />One last thing. I know some people wanted there to also be an HD remake of MGS: The Twin Snakes, the gamecube remake of MGS1 for PS1. I'm one of those people too, and it would've been a great addition to this collection, but I won't let that detract from my rating of the review, so this stays at 5 stars.<br /><br />For the hardcore MGS fan, it's not EVERY Metal Gear Solid game that's ever been released, but it's definitely a collection worth picking up. You're getting way more than $50 here.<br />For the casual gamer or someone new to the MGS franchise, this is an excellent collection to start out with. All the games that you'll need to understand the main story are here in this collection, so it's a great collection to pick up for newcomers as well.<br /><br />There's lots of content to enjoy here, and many hours of playtime collectively.Get it!!Get it!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy playing this game, no shoot um ups required, no loss of enjoyment playing in complete silence. With scoring and lots of options it's truly timeless
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|It was great for nostalgia - seeing all the 80s action heroes gathered in one place. But man, they are old. The beginning of the movie is confusing, and you just never quite seem to catch up. Then again, you're not really watching it for the story, are you?
B005LAII12|4.0|This is a pretty funny movie. There is harsh language, but it's filled with laughs. Not for children at all.
B001HVZO9S|5.0|Shipped on time and super fast. Amazon is an excellent way to shop. Great movie really enjoyed it. I your an old Band Member like myself you will love this movie.
B003Y5H574|4.0|I like this movie a lot. It has heartfelt moments and very funny moments. Steve Carell plays a good part as usual. I like him in these more heart-felt movies than the crude ones.
B004742Y68|3.0|Some movies don't really stand up against the test of time, and this is one of them. I thought Poltergeist II was a little more scary, though the special effects really remove the fright out of both of them.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|This film was delivered to me as promised and I will keep it with my Clint Eastwood collection.of dirty harry movies
B00B7Y0206|4.0|its good on tablet but slow in downloading  some videos..some times videos too much stopped and close again and again ..maybe wireless network  is also a issue..

1476733953|4.0|Totally mesmerizing. Once I started reading it I was addicted! I resented time away from reading.<br />I haven't been reading for pleasure in too long; a bee got in my helmet and I started looking, not knowing what for. This open minded browsing brought me to Hugh Howey. The title caught me, omnibus, great word, what does it mean?<br /><br />Never have read this sort of thing before, most usually I am drawn to travel narratives--non-fiction, mind you! This discovery was a directive from the cosmos, \\"Change your direction!\\"  Why so fascinating? You'll have to try it and see...
B009YN2M7S|3.0|This book has a very slow start for about 3/4 of the way through, then it starts too get very interesting.  The ending was very climatic, but it took a while to get going.
B009CG29RK|5.0|I had seen this in theaters and wanted to see it again before seeing the second one. I was delighted to see that it was still funny and I noticed little things I missed the first time.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I really like this case and the ways I can use it, great protection for my kindle fire.I like the fact you can use it horizontally and vertically and it puts the kindle to sleep when you close it.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|It seemed like this was a 3 hour movie at times as it dragged on, but the sound track was good and DiCaprio played his character well. In some ways he stole the show.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|a humorous episode filled with facetious dialogue. and new characters!<br />a definite good start for the third season and I'm sure this is just the beginning.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Absolutely love this album! I have played it several times already, and it still rocks. I catch myself humming or singing the songs long after the album has finished. Best album I have bought in quite a while.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|We just had to own this movie, Clint Eastwood was great in this movie.sad, funny and heartwarming all at once.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Having read book 1, A Game of Thrones, and being 3/4 of the way through book 2, A clash of Kings, I did enjoy the film, but not without some disappointments due to unnecessary changes from the book to the film.<br /><br />While in the book there was much color and luxury and detail, the film was visually relatively drab and dark. I also didn't appreciate the changes to some of the plots, e.g. in Arya's experiences.<br /><br />I felt the episodes were too short, and the costumes and scenery were too limited.<br /><br />The acting was good, and I liked the film, and loved many of the characters while hating others, but over all I'm disappointed in it after having read the books first. Nevertheless, I'll want to watch season 3 after I read book 3, A Storm of Swords.<br /><br />Again, the film was to me visually dark while in the book there was such magnificent color and splendor of costumes, scenery, architecture, etc.. Always in my mind while watching the film was the sensation that it looks so dark.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|After how terrible season 7 was, this season has been so much better. If you've given up on Supernatural, come give it another chance.
0785165975|5.0|HitGirl was instantly my favorite character when she appeared in the first KickAss book so I was excited to read a book dedicated solely to her and not whiney KickAss. It was a quick read, only 4 chapters but very entertaining and I caught myself chuckling out loud to some of Mindy's one liners. You follow Mindy try to navigate junior high and just trying to be a normal girl while also keeping her nocturnal activities of going after the Genovese family a secret from her mom and cop stepfather. The story kept me entertained and of course plenty of violence.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I own both the G930 & G35. I love both of them. I can hardly tell a difference between the 2. The 930 is slightly lighter feeling when wearing and the ear cups have a higher rotation range.<br /><br />I'm still waiting on the battery to go bad like others have said. It is hard for me to keep up with how much it is used due to my nephew. Even with the extra use by him i find that it goes dead most often because you forget to turn it off instead.<br /><br />I strongly recommend either, or, or both to anyone looking for a usb headset.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|i'm hooked on ncis. I can't believe i'm saying that, but I didn't give it a chance! I watched one night and have been watching ever since. I've even bought all the box sets( I can do without the ads) I can't wait until season 10 comes to dvd.<br />sincerely<br />madhattercyn
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I may up my rating later but right now it simply doesn't work at all. I'll admit I have a sub par tablet and I've yet to find an app to replace Google reader. However I did just purchase a new smartphone which has magnified my tablet's shortcomings. When I replace my tablet I'll reevaluate.<br /><br />Added (on my tablet) to the title. I have a Pandigital Supernova running Android 2.3. I doesn't work at all. However, it works beautifully on my LG Optimus L9 smartphone. Therefore, I'm upping my rating from 1 star to 3. That probably isn't a completely fair rating because I do admit to owning a crappy tablet. However, I am more comfortable using my tablet than my phone due to difference in screen size. Again, I'll re-evaluate when I replace my tablet.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Enjoy the new bond series; Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale, and Skyfall. Daniel Craig and this series bring a darker edge to Bond's character missing since Sean Connery.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I'm still waiting for a game as good as this. You may feel as though you're going back and forth a lot, but it's worth it. hope they make another like it soon. I've been waiting a while .

B005544V6A|5.0|Just a great and different show from the norm about lawyers in corporate litigation and their secrets and intense office politics.  Quirky and interesting characters make the show funny and compelling, a must watch for sure.
0811879542|5.0|Children come over to my house and they always want me to read the Press Here book with them. It was very creatively written and the children love the interaction that they have.  I will be buying more of this book for Christmas presents this year.
B00A6RCSKC|2.0|Ok, honestly, this is a great game. There are dozens of monsters and the game has excellent gameplay. So why only 2 stars I hear you ask! Well! There comes a point where the game becomes quite frankly impossible due the steepness of the difficulty, requiring you to purchase either better heroes or more gems.  I hate these types of games!  I dont want something that is easy but once i have bought a game it should be totally mine and it should be completable without requiring extra payments. Pity because for a td game this is one of the best I have played,(upto about level 9 or 10)
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Well written, definitely worth your time if your profession involves significant complexities, as most professions do.<br /><br />Worth your time. Recommended.
B0007PAMR4|2.0|This is cinema at it's worst. If you were to eliminate the narration, the viewer would be clueless as to the \\"why\\" behind the story events (unless the viewer already knows the story). In this movie the narration is the story and the scenes are like the pictures in a book - only accompaniment to the narration. John Harrison does a far better job of telling the story cinematically in his 2000 TV mini-series. In addition The Children of Dune flows almost seamlessly from Dune.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can t keep my kids away from it, they love i, it has  multiple levels and great graphics sure
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is a smart, funny look at the life of an ordinary woman doing extraordinary things.  Despite what we show the outside world, we are all pretty much the same.
B00AVXSOSG|5.0|Though less known than others, Mansfield Park is by far my favorite Austen novel. Mature and insightful, a great read!
0061706620|5.0|The book it self is in good shape, but it isn't really what I thought it would be. Also it doesn't seem to have every thing the boys talk about in it. All in all I'm still glad to have it in my collection.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I love this game however literally every 30 seconds it's says &quot;oops you lost connectivity and we need to restart&quot;  it's something along those lines and when I have full Internet connection. It's really annoying... but other then that it's a awesome game.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It's the lack of consistency in personalities and characters.  I agree with one of the reviewers who wrote that it felt like this book was so out of character it could have been ghost-written.  I also agree that it seems that some of these characters are more like their true blood relatives that their book selves. I bought the book knowing that it had bad reviews, and as the ending of a series I am not going to tell you to not buy it, but I really wish things could have just ended a few books ago.<br /><br />Somewhere in the last few years, the magic was lost.
0345803485|3.0|It gives a new prespective of arlekin... spicing up the everyday life... probably will reccommend it .. no serious literature though..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a cool game!But the thing that I hate is that you need Internet!But otherwise it is very fun!
B00AAI7B7W|3.0|I know the Exorcist is supposed to be original, but I couldn't get past the language, way to much of it for my taste. The graphics and scenes were great and it was easy to follow.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|love this app it is good for you if you have little brother's and sisters it will keep them busy and if you babysit little kid's it is a must have
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy,  then you need to add this one with it, as it was the one that began it all. These movies follow closer to the book than any other movie I've ever watched. Great acting, scenery, special effects, and no language (proving you can have a great movies without all the obscenities.)
B001MSMULG|5.0|excellent and intriguing...suspenseful and keeps you wanting to keep reading.. great book for a  long plane ride ...very enjoyable reading
B0001I561E|5.0|This is a fun movie of a street smart kid who is tricked into finding the lamp for someone else and discovering his own worth. Worth the see.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I liked Phillip Phillips from day one of American Idol 2012. I liked his individuality, especially, and I was glad to hear that his first release showed this off. I was a little taken aback when the mp3s labelled him Country, which IMHO he most certainly isn't, more of a bluesy folk rock. Anyway, he has writing credits on all but four of the 14 tracks (the two hits: Home and Gone, Gone, Gone, as well as Wicked Game, and So Easy) The 15th is a live version of Home. For me, his original tracks are the best, especially Get Up Get Down and Man on the Moon. Home and Gone, Gone, Gone are too much alike and formulaic, and really shouldn't be back to back on the CD.<br /><br />That quibble aside, thumbs up for this one.
1616550414|5.0|I appreciate that Nintendo released a product like this for their fans. I have loved the Zelda series since first playing Wind Waker in middle school and this book offers a deeper look into the story of of Hyrule and its beginnings. It ties together the games throughout the series and clears up questions of the timeline(for the most part). They have taken the time to detail pieces of the story and extrapolate further on key points. It also brings in useful information that you may not have known beforehand. For an avid fan you will love this book. For a newer fan of the series it will really give you an insight into the realm of the Zelda Universe and what you can expect. They took care into putting it together and this isn't just some ploy to make money. Also seeing the notes from the developers themselves !<br /><br />As for physical features it won't disappoint. The cover is really beautiful and features gold metallicdesigns. My only complaint isn't really about the book but rather about the shipping and what it did to my book. It crushed the corners and the top part of the book as well as a few pages, which for me was very annoying as I am a collector and take extreme care of all my items. I really cannot recommend ordering this book from Amazon as I know I am not the only person who experienced physical defects due to poor shipping/handleing. But I will recommend that in general you pick up Hyrule Historia from another retailer as it's really a superb book. You really can't go wrong with this purchase unless you hate the Zelda series, but if that is the case then why are you even here reading this?
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn's writings will forever be the standard for spy novels. This is a sad day for me, the world and Mitch.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|This is a handy and useful app.  It meets the challenges of scheduling your day with ease, fun and success.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is so thoughtful and creative! Enzo reminds me of my dog that I've had for four years now. He is my best friend and has stuck by my side through thick and thin. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever loved an animal. It is a great read and truly exemplifies the loyalty of a pet to it's owner. The racing metaphors give you a new perspective of life in the eyes of an animal who can only gesture to you their thoughts and feelings. This is the best book I've read in a long time!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Like the app promises.  Take the weather with you on the go, and be knowledgeable of what's expected.  Plus, you can add the weather for other cities of importance.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|LOVED, LOVED, LOVED!! Wow, this story had me feeling every emotion, twists, turns, innocence, fate~ Everyone should read this ~ wow~
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It Felt very typical nothing extraordinary for me. So I would recommend to watch it before buying it outright. lack depth.
B004SDEP38|1.0|It did not download Absolutely no use whatsoever Really disappointed Don't waste your time or effort When you try to open the app it takes to key then to download only h to tell you you have already downloaded It just loops
B005P58PIO|5.0|Of course this show is addictive. There's no way I could stop watching this. It gets better by the minutes. Great production and script.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not being one to typically read this type of book (I'm a male over 35), I found this to be one of the best books I've ever read.  What a story, excellent writing.  Usually I read a book on the train over the course of a month, in that month I've finished this one AND the next book in the series.  I'm currently about half-way through the last book (Mockingjay).  Few fictional books have ever had me hooked as this one did.
B0042KA5EK|5.0|As crazy as this sound I only recently discovered this show. no TV for the last five years and had to order all from Amazon. Yes, I paid the exorbitant, exaggerating and ridiculous price amazon charges for their digital products.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|It dose its work perfectly. The resolution of both monitors are in its full quality, you'll not feel with  any different between One monitor, Two or both while working.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|no kidding this movie is indeed violent. Anyway after watching the previous one with his daughter it's hard not to see him with his son.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|Matt Ridley does it again. A coherent and well thought-out narrative reminding us all of how lucky we really are in most aspects of life. We all too often take it for granted...and things will only improve!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This is very entertaining series. When a series have you searching the internet for clues of the next series, you have a winner. Love the characters, but when you have a character that is well liked (it is evident by the views) should make sure early on you have a contract to keep him.
B00004YRQA|5.0|it is an original memory card and it save your games duhhh and only for ps2 it will not work for ps1. i think the last part was not necessary but you never know.
B008G3N71W|3.0|As erotic novels go this is good, but there is something lacking.  I enjoyed the story and it was well developed but the the erotic parts just left me hanging, I just did not feel the spark that could have been there.
B003UYUP58|5.0|The Emperor of all Maladies by Siddhartha Mukherjee<br /><br />Completed:  July 19th, 2013<br />Delivery:  Utilized eBook as well as audit book from Audible.com<br /><br />The Emperor of all Maladies is an excellent biography of cancer, with a very humane personal touch.  As an oncologist, Siddhartha Mukherjee constantly draws upon his own personnel experiences with the disease and seamlessly interweaves his accounts into the biography.<br /><br />The personal stories interlaced throughout the narrative make this book about a dark disease much more approachable.  His biography begins as far back as 1600 BC  with the first evidence of the disease.  Chapter by chapter he goes down the history of the disease and its current struggle to find a cure.  He further discusses the trials and tribulations of many physicians and scientist as they struggled to gain acceptance of their theories behind cause and cure.  Especially enlightening was his discussion on the extent of gene mutation that ultimately leads to uncontrolled proliferation of cells leading to malignant tumors and cancer.  Mr. Mukherjee certainly doesn't shy away from the science, but his narrative is never dry or overly pontifical.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to everyone, especially if you or a loved one are battling this disease.  It will shed some light on your journey and help you realize that you are not alone in your struggle.<br /><br />[...]
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book! It will go down as one of my favorites. I can tell you I never saw the twists and turns coming but what a ride it was! I can't wait to read the next book!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, I'm not new to what Pam refers to as the &#34;FP&#34; by any means and I normally read much heavier content, but this was great! The experiments were fun and I'm always looking for a book to recommend to beginners that will explain the LOA in a way that is easily understood by the average person and keep their attention. I have found that book! I've already recommended it to at least 10 people and all of them have loved it so far! :) I love Pam's sense of humor and down to earth nature. She is a great writer and I am definitely a fan! I'm going to be looking into more of her work. If you're a long time conscious practitioner of the LOA looking to fine tune your craft, this is likely not what you're looking for, but I still recommend it as it did give some excellent reminders and other perspectives to consider. Overall, for me it was definitely worthy of 4 stars! :)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best of these types of games I've  played yet. Wish it was longer though. If you like problem solving, get it.
B007WFTFG6|2.0|The areas to color are too small and detailed to color with your finger. This was a very frustrating game for my daughter.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have read all of Ken Follett's books and now can't wait for the last book of his trilogy. Thanks.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I read this because i enjoyed the movie so much. This was very different. It is more heartfelt. It isn't funny.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! It's so challenging and great to play with friends! Level 7 was a little trick and I wish the game itself had hints but it's great none the less.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I do like the designs on the tiles, and am using it to think my numbers in Chinese, which I am trying to learn.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun and the minions are so super cute. I don't like the vector battle at all though.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I loved this program, however, when it updated, I lost it and it will not install to my android tablet.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is great for Boys and Girls my little brother adores it<br />And I encourage TeamLava to keep doing what their doing.

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I always loved Free Cell. I had not played in a long time until I purchased this download. I enjoy it very much. It took me a couple games to get the hang of all the shortcuts, but it is great fun, and so far, has worked very well.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Funny, romantic  and with a little horror thrown in, who could want more? A great movie to watch when you want to laugh and have a little excitement.
6305128952|5.0|Been a Redford fan since Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (or before).  Loved the ranch life/wide open spaces and the love story that developed.  Glad they didn't use the ending from the book!  As much as I enjoy watching 'Bob', in my opinion, Scarlett Johansson was a runaway as an actress.  This is a comfort movie for me.
0143142216|4.0|Good Book, always kept your interest. All three Cussler series, Dirk Pitt Adventure, Kurt Austin & now starting the Oregon Files. Have not been disappointed in Cussler's books to date.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It was basically my life, on screen.  I loved it and am amazed about how it might have been written.  I could have written it.  I wish I did write it.  I would love to even meet the writer.  I never give out 5/5 star reviews on movies either.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|much on the same quality level as all Lord of the Rings movies...enjoyed the viewing and appreciated the connection to<br />the Rings movies...having read the books it was a good visual support to my past reading experiences...
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It makes the Kindle HD MUCH more functional in the &#34;real&#34; world. The real internet world, that is. Just a file explorer.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|A while ago, I bought a dual usb car charger and noticed that it took forever to charge my phone.  I would be in a car ride for over an hour and it would barely charge more than 5%.  So I went on a hunt for car charger that would actually charge my phone in a decent amount of time.  Buying this item was definitely a good choice!<br /><br />This is my first purchased Anker item.  It's small, compact, and charges my phone quickly, which is exactly what I needed.  If you need an excellent car charger, this is it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I went into the showing thinking it would have some action and mostly drama. I was not disappointed. Great show, but only 10 episodes a season which is depressing.
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|This movie was simply filled with predictability. Why even watch it, because everything you expect to happen will. Don't waste your time.[[ASIN:B005OT2YVA Transformers: Dark Of The Moon]]
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I have loved this series since i was a kid...seeing it on Bluray not only enhances the beloved series but pops the ideals behind the show back into my head...look forward to watching it with my family over and over...
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|the one and only tom hanks movie I did not fall in love with... I couldn't even finish it, but im going to bc hopefully it gets better, it was really hard to follow and understand...hopefully I just did not watch long enough
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was the best. Your sad, but in a good way. that is all I will say- Emily Shanklin
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|this movie was just fabulous! it kind of starts out a little slow, but it gets a lot better and the ending is very original and leaves you wanting to know more
1475972350|3.0|To this author's credit, let me laud first the boldness represented in this work. It isn't the run-of-the-mill thriller-mystery. Mr. Thiede tried something a little off the main in a publishing landscape where such a thing can mean the death knell of a reputation. The description of scenes is impeccable. The story itself in basic form is original and interesting. And the twists are thoroughly shocking--the weaknesses of the story notwithstanding. Mr. Thiede, you've really got something here; it just needs a little more love to really shine.<br /><br />This novel began strong, placing readers en medias res, but started losing steam in the attempt to establish characters other than the antagonist and put them to work.<br /><br />The idea for this story is a very good one. It's fresh, but its execution lacks because when the reader is not scratching his head trying to figure out how many events portrayed can be possible, he is being informed through dialog of rationale and motive. It's difficult to simply enjoy the characters and that's a shame because they all have so much potential.<br /><br />Editing could be sharper. There are a lot of mistakes that some line editor love can do wonders for. As for the story, it just needs better development, more thought and work on the logistics and mechanics of the action. The plot is worth that. I'd like to see this work in another, improved edition.<br /><br />Despite its issues, as I said before, the nuts and bolts of this story are strong. It is this strength that earns it, in my humble estimation, a solid three stars.  I really hope to see this story revamped at some point.
B00DU74U74|5.0|it was a none stop emotional rollercoaster! following the character as she starts feeling human emotions and fights to do what is right
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I was kind of if fy about starting this series. But now that i have I'm dieing to read the next book! Adventure, friendship, betrayal, a little bit of romance, and finding you self. There's just a little bit of everything in this book. It slowly gets into the exciting stuff and doesn't rush to a conclusion. You get all. Sides of the story even if it is just through one character. Most of the characters are really relatable too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|5 stars love it so much it is a page turner. I need seven words may the odds be wait I can't spell
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|Graphics are fine the controls are easy to reach and the stress factor is high as you try to land rainstorms or with aircraft malfuctions makes you feel like you''re at20000  feet well done a must play for flight enthusiasm
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I researched this quite a bit, and this charger turned out to be the best of what is available. It's not perfect. One port is still at the lower voltage. But it fits nicely into my lighter plug.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|you cannot go wrong with Sigur Ros and this CD definitely proved it. you cannot go wrong by getting this, our anything else by them!
B0090SI4LU|2.0|I had no idea you could make a movie with zero action, zero human drama and zero reality.  I was wrong!  Give some of the kids shiny contact lenses and you apparently have an automatic sense of US vs. THEM.  Folks who will kill themselves rather than have shiny eyes.  Folks who will kill you rather than let you keep dull eyes.  Folks that will write bad dialogue for you if you aren't impressed by their spotless white outfits and spray can medicine!  If this is Hollywood, send it back before it's too late.  You could end up possessed by a racist 10,000 year old alien in search of her inner cross-cultural demon.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I don't enjoy this as much as other match 3 games that i've played. I'm going to keep playing and see if there is something I'm missing.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|David O. Russell is making a name for himself by taking terribly conventional scripts/plots and turning out remarkably original movies full of life and energy.  He did it first with \\"Three Kings,\\" but then again, and with more accolades with \\"The Fighter,\\" which on paper was just another movie about an underdog boxer, but on screen was fascinating, funny, and one of the best sports films to come along in years.  And now he's back with \\"Silver Linings Playbook,\\" and he's doing the same thing for the romantic-comedy-amongst-kooks genre.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper plays a guy fresh out of a mental hospital after nearly beating his wife's lover to death.  He's trying hard to be better, and even harder to convince everyone else that he's better.  His friends hook him up with Jennifer Lawrence, who, since her cop husband died in a freak accident, has slept with nearly everyone in town.  The motives of his friends are questionable.  Are they trying to get him laid so that he'll forget about his ex-wife?  That's super sketchy, since Lawrence is clearly dealing with her own craziness and needs people around her who will protect her, not enable her.<br /><br />But then it becomes clear that just about everyone in \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is some kind of crazy. It's sort of the mirror image of \\"Arrested Development.\\"  In that show, Jason Bateman thinks he's the only sane one surrounded by a bunch of lunatics, but really, he's just as nuts as everyone else.  Here, Bradley Cooper thinks he's the one with mental issues surrounded by normal people, but everyone else is just as insane as he is.<br /><br />Take, for instance, his father, played by Robert De Niro.  He's a bookie and a passionate, superstitious Eagles fan.  He honestly seems to think that the way he holds a certain handkerchief has an effect on the outcome of the game.  De Niro believes that Cooper watching the game with him makes a difference. That's insane.  Betting on it is even more insane.  That's a weird pressure to put on somebody - I'm betting heavy because I believe you're good luck and the Eagles are going to win because you're at the game.  Not playing IN the game, AT the game.  You can't do anything REAL to help the team win the game, you can't take the field and catch a touchdown pass, so if they lose and you were there being good luck, what then?  You didn't do enough? Didn't do what enough? If my dad bet all he had on a  football game because he believed that my good luck presence was going to determine the game - me one out of 50,000 fans attending, 150,000 watching -- I would have a nervous breakdown right then and there.<br /><br />Lawrence is the hero of the film because instead of resisting everyone's  craziness, she just meets them in it.  In the best sequence of the movies (and one of the best sequences in movies, period,)  instead of telling De Niro that he's insane to think that his son's relationship with her is detrimental to the Eagles, she just goes with it.  And she's done her research.  I love the way this whole sequence is filmed, directed and acted.  There are so many characters involved, really involved in this scene; there's so much energy to it.  The plot mechanics are pretty straight forward; you need to film a confrontation scene that ends with this crazy bet upon which the rest of the film will be predicated. But the way it's handled is so loose -- and frenetic -- that it really feels like a situation that just evolves into what it becomes. Nothing feels forced. And so a really implausible plot point -- the calling card of nearly all romantic comedies -- feels honestly believable.<br /><br />All of \\"Silver Linings Playbo0k\\" feels messy, loose and thrown together.  At first glance, you'd think the director is hardly in control of what's going on here.  But on closer look, it becomes clear that this madness is by design.  For instance.  Russell uses the editing, and the score, to create a sense of things happening too fast, which I think is supposed to be how Cooper feels about the world - there are just too many things happening, too fast, both inside and outside of his head, for him to deal with them all.  If everything would just slow down a little, he might be all right.  But everything escalates.  On top of that, Russell gets great, fully invested performances from everyone involved.  That's no easy task, and I wonder what his secret is. Some of these actors, I've never seen them working this hard. Others, De Niro in particular, look like he just woke up from a long nap of acting in silly and stupid movies. I've stopped watching movies just because Robert De Niro is in them, but I'll hazard a guess - he hasn't been this invested since he directed himself in \\"The Good Shepherd.\\"<br /><br />This is a heck of a movie, and David O. Russell is a heck of a director, someone I'll definitely be watching in years to come.  His movies are alive in a way a lot of movies aren't, and they're really fun and intriguing to watch.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Good game to pass time with. Each level only takes a few minutes and goes by quickly. Glad I got it.
B00127RAJY|2.0|Overall I was disappointed with this product.  I enjoyed level 1, but I found level 2 to be awful, and level 3 to be only marginally better.  I gained 5 pounds while using this DVD.  I read reviews and people said that weight-loss began around level 3, I stuck it out and continued to only gain weight.  I took measurements when i began this workout and every week while using it and I lost a total of 1 inch combined from different areas on my body.  I felt like this workout was a waste of time.  I know that muscle weighs more than fat, but the fact that I didn't notice of feel any changes in my body. I hope that you have better luck than I did.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|use it every moment of my life. records almost everything of everything. writing, pictures, videos, voices, links,, also i can use it in any computer, smartphones, and tablets. just perfect.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I thought it was a very cute twist on all the zombie movies.<br />Yes, I would recommend it to someone else.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Could not put it down.  Page after page it was very entertaining with plenty of twists, turns and excitement.  You won't regret this purchase.
B00BEXB18M|2.0|Many of the songs sound the same and the last few albums are like Metallica's, just watered down versions of what they once where.<br />Still go to see Megadeth in concert, but only for the few older songs they play.<br />Many of the thrash bands are pathetic these days, except for Overkill/Anthrax which just keep it going.<br /><br />Not worth even $10 for these CD's.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love this series. Beware though, if you're reading the books, make you your read at least partially into Book 3 before you watch this whole season. It's also a lot more different than the book than Season 1 was to Book 1.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I admit it. I saw the movie first. I really liked the film. As someone who went to high school from 1990 to 1994, someone who discovered The Smiths in 9th grade and never looked back, someone who as a freshman made a lot of older friends who changed my perspective on many, many things, the film spoke to me in a MAJOR way.<br /><br />I still really like the film, but as is often the case, the book is better. I love Charlie. And I think calling him Holden Caulfield-esque is dismissive. Any coming of age novel written after The Catcher in the Rye is going to feel its influence, but to my mind, Charlie is so much more than Holden. He is sensitive, loving, wants to see the good in everyone, wants everyone to be happy, even the people who disappoint him. Holden would never wish happiness on anyone who disappoints him. Charlie's mind works in ways that scare him and I can feel for a person who just can't stop the wheels from turning in their brain. It can be exhausting. I love Charlie's voice and his character arc was compelling and, for me, familiar and nostalgic. This book is awash in nostalgia, and I don't think that's a bad thing.<br /><br />As for the \\"banned book\\" status due to teenage sexuality, smoking, drinking, and drugs. COME ON NOW. What world are we living in? This is an honest portrayal of teenage life. All of that stuff was present in my high school life. Some kids partook in it, some didn't. What I liked about this book was that it didn't show those things as pure evil, they were just there, a part of life. We lived our lives and we dealt with things. Sometimes very adult things. And that is what the characters in this book do.<br /><br />Truly, I loved this book.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Love the books, love the series, love getting them off Amazon! Matches Book 1 pretty closely, but I would at least begin Book 2 before you watch it all the way through.
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|In 8th grade my World Literature teacher, Mrs. Knapp, gave the class three books to choose from for our final reading assignment that year: 1984, Ivanhoe, or Rebecca. The boys all chose 1984, the girls all chose Rebecca. No one chose Ivanhoe (too long!). Thank goodness for Mrs. Knapp (she also assigned Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice that year, inspiring my lifelong Jane Austen fanatacism)! Rebecca grabbed hold of me with its mystery, beautifully descriptive writing, and nameless heroine. I've read it several times since that first time in 8th grade and I always enjoy it anew. Manderley has come to be very familiar to me, I can picture perfectly its lodge gates, its winding drive, its rose garden, its rooms, the Happy Valley and the small cove. The idea of Manderley is so romantic but always with a little bit of dread. It's not only the second Mrs. De Winter who dreams about Manderley, I, the reader, have dreamed about it too.
B007SSF3O0|3.0|Be advised, men, this one will take a little while to get into (if you can get into it) so hang in there.  It is not a bad story at all, just not the typical male movie watching fodder.  There is a little comedy to chuckle at and you can spend time cuddling with your wife while watching, so if she picks it, go with it.
0062280228|5.0|Scary, wondrous, magical, sad, moving, confounding, anxiety-ridden, brave, lyrical, insightful, profound. Pick any one of these words and it perfectly describes this haunting new book by Neil Gaiman. He continues to be one of the world's greatest living authors.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Helps pass the time and entertain my 3yr old and 5month daughter, good music and vibrant colors love how the little chimp juggles the bananas still only in the first level
B00AFZ3P3Y|4.0|Oh Thomas Hardy, you illustrator of pain and suffering, you dogged chronicler of life's tragedies and sadness. Poor Susan. Poor Elizabeth-Jane. Poor Lucetta. Poor Farfrae. And poor, poor Henchard. It seems strange that I enjoyed this book as much as I did considering how it revels in pain. But I did. Thomas Hardy is an interesting writer and I enjoy his odd narrative stylings. I find all his characters very well drawn even the minor ones. The only squabble I have, and it's an unfair one, is that if you've read any Hardy at all you kind of know how it's going to end because they all end the same. This one especially was easy to plot out. But all in all, it was still a very enjoyable read
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Drew Berrymore is great in this movie. I love period movies and this one is fun to watch over and over. There are few movies I would watch multiple times and this is one.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Best season of all. I love all ncis episodes but these episodes were riviting. They even captured my husband's attention and he doesn't even watch the show.
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|What a touching and heart felt movie! One of Robin Williams best! Watching it in Blu-ray is fantastic. All my movies will be in Blu-Ray from now on!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and quite easy to play. I play it traveling to rodeoz across the country<br />This game can be played by all ages
B00992CF6W|5.0|All there is yo say is... OMG,  this is probably the best app on the entire Amazon.com! Creepers that explode,  swords,  armorial,  and (drumroll please), TNT! The $7 is totally and honestly worth it in every way possible.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  KJV version is available.  All three of my kids use this app for their daily devotions.  I personally think it is a little difficult to use, but they seemed to have figured it out.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I'm a little snobby about shows, but this one is fantastic. Great writing, sharp characters, and a fun twist on an old classic. One of the best pilots I've ever seen, too. Wish there were more episodes. Gorgeously shot, too, and a good blend of mystery and snark.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|This game is okay at first while you are trying to figure it out.  However, once you do, the game becomes boring really quick.
B004LTA9MK|3.0|The cd did not have all the songs listed on cover which was disappointing as one of the missing songs was my favorite.
B00003CXA6|5.0|excellent casting and historically accurate!!<br />Wish there were more film like this. I liked the wide screen edition as well.
0062238868|5.0|just like sitting across the table and talking to CK couldnt put it down once I started it. these guys are really our freedom insurers
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|good movie,
B00BZW5W3W|4.0|I love the CD, the lyrics, music, everything, but, I was so disappointed that the CD will not play in my computer driver :( so I guess I can only listen when I'm in the car, which is not that often.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I can view and create a document or spreadsheet when needed. Definitely great with the Full Version Key. Great App!
B008EZVNFE|4.0|I love the CD, the lyrics, music, everything, but, I was so disappointed that the CD will not play in my computer drive :( so I guess I can only listen when I'm in the car, which is not that often.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I got this app free from the amazon app store. It opened all the features that I needed to access my documents and spreadsheets!
B009LDXQGW|4.0|I love the CD, the lyrics, music, everything, but, I was so disappointed that the CD will not play in my computer drive :( so I guess I can only listen when I'm in the car, which is not that often.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Which says a bunch.  That movie is creative, hilarious, engaging, action-packed.  So is this one.  Moved way too fast (not developed enough) for a five star, otherwise, great.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I really liked this book. It was a bit frustrating at times but overall I enjoyed it. 4 stars because I wasn't crazy about the ending.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Bad director?  Bad writer?  No passion?  It was all action, no comedy/wit that Bruce is known for.  Felt shallow so don't recommend.
B009FB3W9G|3.0|Not what I expected. Some of it fair, some good. Suggest you read description before ordering. Only 2 songs were performed by Barbra.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Zombies turning back into humans, falling in love, trying to think, discovering how to think/get memories, battles, etc.  Wonderful quality movie for zombie genre fans that want quality, not B-movies.
1594153515|4.0|I didn't find that &#34;ah hah&#34; moment, but it was interesting and had some good advice.  Take a chance and see if it has information that realtes to your relationships.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|High quality.  Two slots.  One for Android, one for Apple.  Sleek.  Would be helpful if the text on the slots was more visible, but still great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wonderful game. Got me hooked right away. A good challenge that isn't  frustrating! Lots of fun and a great way to loose track of time trying to finish!! LOVE!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Worth a watch.  Not the best because well-known actors could have acted better than the main character but failed.  The armor was distracting.  Giants well done.
B0055S348W|5.0|The print program was easy to set up and printed perfectly from the getgo. What a joy to finally have a program that is so easy to install & use.  Recomment to all.  Use it on my nook color hd and droid 4 phone.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I actually watched it twice.  Once you adapt to following hundreds of years of lives of main characters, its enjoyable.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is very addictive and way better than temple run. I REALLY LOVE THIS GAME.it was amazing.if u want to download it u really should.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Never downloaded. Probably because it was a free app day. Would have been nice to try it. Oh, well. Bye.
0345803507|3.0|I had different expectations. Enjoyed the first 2 felt like the third dragged on. Stopped reading it 3/4 through. Characters were superfiscial.<br />A vehicle to write an x-rated book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|addicting!! wish there was more levels to play on the free app. I may end up purchasing to see if I can beat the game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app.  I can check my Sisters locations.  I love the maps you can move them with your finger.  Great info.  I live in Florida so I can many times a day.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Despicable Me is a cute little movie without much substance. It was enjoyable spending the time watching with my kids but wouldn't be anything to watch alone on a lazy evening.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was a quick read, but it was also very funny and a good love story.  Glad I read it.
0062255657|4.0|Having been a fan of his earlier classics - The Graveyard Book,  Coraline, and American Gods, I set off once more to envelop myself - or should I say take the plunge into Neil Gaiman's latest release.  Although short in length compared to his other works, Ocean At The End Of The Lane is far from disappointing.  The lead character of the story - a seven year old boy who is never named throughout the story, is very much a personal touch by the author. Bearing similarities to Gaiman's childhood and surrounds of the rural English countryside.  The unnamed boy befriends a girl named Lettie on the neighboring Hempstock Farm.  The farms occupants - as with most of Gaiman's works - are immortal beings, trying their best to be human-like.  They freely open this world to the boy, but with dire consequences.  Releasing an unnatural force that will take courage and bravery to destroy forthwith.<br /><br />This book really hit home with me too by reminding me of the similarities to Roald Dahl's portrayal of child heroes in his books.  A young child, a sort of family outcast, learning of a magical world that could be so blind to adults.  Learning to face their fears against creatures of great magnitude and power - be they human or mythological.<br /><br />For someone like me who can really find it difficult to get into a fantasy novel, I feel that Neil Gaiman's penmanship can ease any fear of a complicated mythological story line, to attract readers of all tastes.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Potential spoilers!!!!!<br /><br />I liked the first two books, but this one is my least favorite. I was hoping for more but the book didn't deliver. All questions were answered but I didn't like how the book ended. It was still a good rad especially if you want to know how the maze runner series ended.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you love bingo then this is the game for you.  You get all the fun of bingo, plus you have items to collect and goals to meet. Plus many different rooms to complete.

B00BSBVLF8|5.0|What is a compilation of acts from several Cirque shows is masterfully woven into a simple tale of boy meets girl. Stunning photography and gorgeous attention to detail make this film a feast for the eyes. A wonderful escape from the everyday grind.
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|1) Early in the film, they killed off the majority of the original characters that made the first movie good.<br /><br />2) With what was left of this film it should of been a \\"B\\" movie as the story-line was a joke.<br /><br />3) Cobra Commander ops to destroy all the world's nuclear missiles rather then allow Armageddon to take place. Whats the point of being a bad guy if you wus out the moment of your greatest victory?<br /><br />Point Blank, don't watch this movie until its free... Definitely not worth purchasing.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|I have watched this movie a dozen times and the quality is great. Happy customer!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is one of the best hidden object/mini-puzzle games I've played. The graphics are great, the<br />detective story is clever, and being able to use the &quot;hint&quot; button to navigate without waiting for it to recharge was terrific.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it. Can't wait for more rooms. Very well made. Involves lots of logic and brain thought in order to solve. My 5 year year-old grandson was able to solve as well.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is a great adventure, hidden object, mini-puzzle game. The  graphics are terrific, and the &quot;hint&quot; button helps you navigate without having to wait for it to recharge. One of the best!
0786948523|5.0|product was wonderful and exactly what i wanted and needed. this is just the book i needed to complete the d&d experience for me and friends.
B00DBSZEH2|2.0|If you have ever seen The Brothers Grimm then don't bother.  I really wanted to love this movie but the plot was redundant and followed The Brothers Grimm closely.  Not to mention the ending was abrupt.  I wouldn't rent this again even if it was free.
0786956291|5.0|Simple and easy to use. good base set for beginners. had everything i needed to start a basic adventure with a few friends.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Although I truly enjoyed this trilogy I was desperately waiting for more at the end.  There was very little closure, which I suppose was the point, but it just felt rushed and unfinished.  I was disappointed I put in the time with the characters and had very little resolve.
B009AJDET6|5.0|The re-issue industy is in full swing, yet another re-package of Chicago. 69-78 represents all that's good and bad for this band. From their early days as innovative, hippie, anti-war & protest songs to the nadir of their career or one of many 'Hot Streets'. CTA, II, III & V are essential the remainder have great songs mixed in with some MOR stuff. V in particular contains the magnificent Robert Lamm song 'A Hit By Varese' and 'VII has 'Wish You Were Here' with the Beach Boys. Many blame Terry Kath's death for the downhill slide but it was evident before his tragic death. Many fans have stayed loyal over the years - this box is all you'll need and you'll be able to make more room in the box by ditching 'Hot Streets'. At just over £2.00 per record who would have thought in 40 years music would have become so dispensable & cheap. When much of this was indispensable when first released - what's the world coming to?<br /><br />By Chicago X Robert Lamm was writing such searching lyrics as 'I'd rather be rich, digging a ditch'....so much for the revolution.<br /><br />Bonus tracks are as the original Rhino re-re-releases 10 years ago.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Great movie. Kind love it. And I do too.  Would recommend to anyone
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game you should come and play with us thank you for creating this app its awesome
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|One of my son's favorite movies. He brings friends over just to watch 3D.  Received very quick.  Thank you for making things easy.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is very fun and entertaining. It is great for kids and adults. Also recommend watching it before watching the sequel.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This was a good family movie. The plot was well done and the special effects were noticeable. The actors carried out their roles professionally.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Repetitive and devoid of plot.  I really do not understand why it got 4 star rating by so many readers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really loved this game.. challenging and fun..once you start you just can't stop..loved how each room was more intricate.. please hurry with more rooms.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Wonderful book! I really loved it! Powerful female characters, which is always a plus and set in Neil's emotive world of Gods, worlds and passion.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Perfect for reading and learningh using the highlight and note functions. Does exactly what's  supposed to no less no more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is amazing! I can't wait for Season 4! No spoilers here, but I really hope the last episode was misleading!
B00519YOY8|5.0|Did,t recieve this movie. Ive seen this movie in the past, and enjoyed the movie. fun for all ages to watch.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|Downloaded the FREE app with no problem. Downloaded the FREE software on my laptop, again without any problem. Couldn't get My Kindle Fire to connect to my laptop though. Had several attempts and even uninstalled and downloaded again but it still didn't work. Even tried downloading the free HD version of Splashtop without success. When I downloaded the app version which called for a monthly or annual subscription it connected immediately and my two devices recognised each other but I didn't pay the fee as I should have been able to take advantage of the FREE app. Wanted it to work but only if FREE. I can't comment therefore on how the app works when connected. It left me feeling very frustrated.
B00785P2QC|4.0|great game folks been playing for two days now!<br />gonna buy the game as soon as I can get outstanding bed
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is a great movie we all enjoy. You get to see lot of heroes. Probably will watch few more time. :)
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I didn't think it would be possible to make a Pacific Theater epic that would hold up to the standard of &#34;Band of Brothers.&#34;  'The Pacific' is a tour-de-force success because it didn't try to be anything except itself.
B006M6GPMS|5.0|I have loved Gilbert's music fir years... It arrived perfectly. So many great songs and memories. Love how easy it is to find what you want on Amazon
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|At the beginning it did not go to the home page but it did after a while ans I say everyone should play it
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I completely enjoy playing Nemo's Reef. But now mine is stuck in a &quot;Nemo's Reef has stopped&quot; block and I can't get it open. I try over &amp; over and time after time I get the stuck message.  But my friend can visit my reef from hers so I know it's still out there in space somewhere.<br />What the heck is going on and how do I fix this ?
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome. It is the best game ever.  I got it and I love it. When the  update came it was more  awesome.
B00AAS6862|5.0|I really liked this movie.. The main actor, Liam, is a very good actor for kidnapping movies! My favorites of his are the &#34;Taken&#34; Series!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have played this game with my family and it is great. You should defiantly get this game. It is such a funny and exciting adventure you take with the most adorable minions. And most importantly it is affordable for everyone.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love this app as it gives me the status of my Kindle HD.  I miss the battery charging light on the HD, but I know this tracks the charge fairly accurately and is a handy app.
1490313370|5.0|Firstly, thank you to James for writing this book!. This is a stimulus package for the mind. We get to learn from James experiences in this book. More and more people are finding their careers stagnating in the corporate world and James offers some timely advice on how to approach this situation.  I fall into the 30 percent who love the book and since this work has helped so many people already it really does make the cynical minority irrelevant . Really like the authors writing style. I would also recommend Sir Ken Robinson's book The Element, which takes a look at why it is important tune into those things that really interest us as individuals to find your calling in life. Fascinating stuff!.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This should be a must read for everyone who thinks they know about how our modern world works.  Nikola Tesla just wanted to invent and if he had of been interested in money probably would have been the richest man in the world.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|First, no problems here as for virus, etc. But to be sure, I have it blocked by my firewall (Avast).<br />A pretty challenging game. Eyesight is key, at least for me!<br />But it's fun. Needs more levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Pretty fun to play awesome game little slow but I like it. Does run down the battery but it's probably just because it's a game.
B009H442DG|3.0|It was ok and that was about it.<br /><br />I was expecting something that was at least interesting as I really like Olivia Newton-Johns voice but it was just kind of bland and uninteresting. Since I like the stuff they had done together in Grease I was hoping to hear the same 'spark' here. I felt this was a missed opportunity to do something special.<br /><br />The product came quickly and was in perfect shape.<br /><br />I would rate this a 5.5 to 6.0 out of 10.
B00992CF6W|5.0|V  At first I got it thinking it was a mind game. Then, i  watched my friend play it, and I soon was better than her. Although, I have HEROBRINE as a &quot; pal&quot;
B0012TWRAO|5.0|I bought one for each bike and extras for other mounting positions besides the handlebars. They are simple, well made and sturdy and hold my GoPro or phone really well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is awesome and I totally, truely revomemnd it. its great. it is also very fun. yep it is fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Really enjoying this app so far. Wish I knew how to get more jewels but I'll figure it out soon hopefully.
B008UCCKSU|5.0|It's been a favorite of mine for years! There's actually a difference in Jim Carrey with and without the mask on. Normally, he's just a regular bachelor who works at a bank and then he finds a mask with magic powers that turn him into a wild, mischievous, life-of-the-party kind of character and it even gives him super human powers! It's also pretty cool how it's kind of a mix of action and comedy. The bad guys with guns help mix the movie's genre up a little. Not that it's violent at times, it's kinda like a cartoon. In fact, that's exactly what Jim Carrey's character is with the mask on, basically. A cartoon character.
B00CMYRVAO|4.0|Don't sleep on \\"Doubleback\\"  I've always been a fan - but his last two CDs were dropped from rotation - uninspiring.  THIS ONE???!!!  Oh love darn near every cut - THIS is Grown Folks Music.  Can't decide which cut is my favorite - but its most likely Love of My Own, next most likely would be Compromise.  This CD is a winner - for me the weakest parts are when he brings in Too Short and Fantasia (sorry I've never been a fan of Fantasia's voice) and Too Short's time has past as far as I am concerned.  Nevertheless - DoubleBack, Walk Away and Smoove (esp. where he tips his hat to Mr. Grey) Oh Yeah, I LOVE this CD - turn off the lights - grab your own brown skinned love - and let the music take its course.  ;-)<br /><br />Good Night y'all.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Holds my kindle perfect !can keep it clean and always know where it is stand makes it easy to put on table for easy use !
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My friend told me about this game and I like. I gave this game 5 stars because it is a cool game.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Like this game keeps me busy !my husband plays and likes the different levels that th he game has in his !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|unwashed skeptical of this game ag first thinking it would be dumb and boring but quickly learned that it was actually really fun and addicting great download
B00003JRCQ|3.0|Perhaps the very best of all Austen adaptations --  as faithful to the book as a movie can be, passionate, restrained, elegant but fully alive. Sound and video quality of this DVD is wretched.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|The jurassic park trilogy in blu ray is just awesome. Brings back memories of being a kid. The set came in the mail sooner than expected and i could not be more happier with my purchase
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Jack teacher is my favorite character & this book is very good. I will continue with this series & read all of them.
0061537969|5.0|Except it is soooooo sad & I had to read it at the same time my own dog got ill---hit home very hard, but still couldn't stop reading it as tears streamed down my face.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Changed my perspective on how humans evolved to run and the backwards way of the athletic shoe industry. A great read that served as an entertaining history lesson and an incredible story
193700788X|5.0|There she goes again!  Every body wants Sookie for something & she struggles with all her paranormal relationships as much as anyone with the extra complications.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|While there were funky moments because of the big names, this was a good action flick with a good story.  Very entertaining.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have a 1 1/2 year old that loves to play this game on his granny's kindle fie HD. I downloaded it on mine for at my house and now he never leaves me alone about seeing the horses. It is the cutest thing ever.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this mind challenging game very entertaining.  I enjoy hidden objects but the room topped it for me.  And the graphics are stunning.  Definitely a must have....hurry with the next game, please!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I stepped outside of my comfort zone to read this one and I'm so glad I did.  I was totally hooked.  Looking forward to the upcoming film and hoping they don't ruin it!
B00064WSNW|4.0|One of their very best. Belew and Levin were never better in other venues. 30 years old and not a note sounds dated. Ought to be re-released!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Good book but very predictable and yawn-worthy in parts.  The story kept me entertained enough though and I don't regret the purchase.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|M14 is a lot of fun.  This game is a great way for p people to be introduced to m magic for the first time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this entire series and couldn't put it down!  I am eagerly awaiting the release of the next part, Dust.  I have also thoroughly enjoyed reading many of the fan-fiction spin-off stories to this series.  I literally can't get enough!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a very cute show.  Kids will love watching over and over and adults will like it as well.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I have the movie on DVD and love it.  I read the book expecting it to be different.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book and the movie are very very similar.  The book adds some more depth, of course, but I thought the movie was very well done.  Very enjoyable read.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Not the best book to read. I had difficulty staying interested in it. Thought it would be the last one, but NO it will continue. Question is will I?
0393339882|3.0|I am a layman who is interested in understanding this subject. I read this book twice trying to better understand it. I enjoyed reading about the various physicists and their incrdible discoveries. It was a treat learning how they uncovered the periodic table and the structure of the atom.<br /><br />My problem came towards the end of the book where the author discusss Einstein's problem with Bohr''s  wave-particle duality. The book was simply to difficult to understand!!<br /><br />I understood about 5% of the author's discussion of reality. Good luck to others who tackle this book.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|I think I have seen this game before. Not an adorable chimp, maybe something else. Nothing new nor interesting about this game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Even with so much dark sex, all three books provided a captivating story.  I'd like more of these stories but with a little less sex.  The sex slows the story down too much for my liking.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It is a very fun and entertaining game.  It made me jump quite a few times.  I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't sure I could really get into this story but, in the end, I couldn't wait to read the entire trilogy and now I want more.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to live up to my expectations. The stories and interesting and varied. The characters are novel and you really get involved on their lives.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It is so up-lifting to read a story where one finds such growth and transformation in the main characters.  More, more, more.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game so far. It hasn't made it impossible to continue without buying stuff. It helps direct you through the game by giving you goals. I would recommend it to my friends.
0316069884|5.0|In a decidedly nuanced way, Foer takes us with him on his own journey - thinking about animal products and where they come from. His approach is factual and objective, but at the same time deeply personal and moving. I can honestly say this book, like no other, changed my views and philosophy.
0345529057|5.0|The books are great, and the quality is good. Haven't read them all but I like them and its a good read :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Wonderful idea for your table ! Now you have it at your fingertips. What more can you ask for. My husband love's it.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|So many films nowadays are focused on the troubles of the young and seem so shallow and meaningless. This story is so different in that it focuses on the many facets of the elderly. The cast is marvelous, and each bring a depth of both personality and humanity to their roles. You'll learn that it's never too late to love and to mend bridges. If you enjoy British movies and TV, you'll love this film!
B008JFURB0|3.0|The release of animated features has become more and more frequent.  With so much more competition, Disney is no longer the biggest kid on the playground.  Quite to the contrary, there are several kids on the playground - and they're all roughly the same size.  Illumination Entertainment has had major hits on its hands with the Despicable Me films and Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, while Sony Pictures Animation has cashed in with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and its revitalization of The Smurfs.  Still, no film studio has made more animated films than The Walt Disney Company, which also includes its vast library and the popular Pixar branch.  However, if there's one studio that has rivaled the success of Disney in recent years, it's DreamWorks Animation.  DreamWorks is responsible for such hits as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and The Croods.  And, the odds are DreamWorks will have another successful moneymaker on its hands with the sports comedy, Turbo.<br /><br />Turbo stars the voice of Ryan Reynolds as Theo/Turbo, an average snail with an obsession for speed.  Theo never seems to be able to do anything right, spending most of his time watching racing videos on television and pretending he's a race car driver.  Theo's brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti), rejects his brother's obsession, believing he should spend more time focused on working at the tomato planet.  However, unforeseen events cause Theo to come into contact with nitrous oxide, which empowers him to move at extraordinary speeds.  Now going by the name \\"Turbo,\\" and working in an unlikely partnership with Tito (Michael Pe&ntilde;a), a Taco stand owner, Turbo is entered into the Indianapolis 500 - where he must go head-to-head with his idol, Indy car driver, Guy Gagn&eacute; (Bill Hader).  The voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Ken Jeong, Michelle Rodriguez, and Snoop Dogg also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />To be honest, Turbo leaves a great deal to be desired in comparison to other popular animated films, like Toy Story or Monsters Inc.  While there's very little doubt this film will go over extremely well with kids, it lacks charming, likeable characters.  Ryan Reynolds has gone stale in Hollywood, so it makes sense that he's doing voice work in an animated feature.  At the same time, there's no better actor in Hollywood than Paul Giamatti, so it's a bit of a waste of talent for him to be dong voice work in a supporting role.  Speaking of supporting roles, the supporting cast is not remotely entertaining enough in comparison to the supporting cast of films like Madagascar, Toy Story, or even another DreamWorks film, Rise of the Guardians.  Their quips are tiresome, often lame and leave a gaping role where the comedy should have been.  However, there are brief seconds of humor from Ken Jeong, who portrays a woman shopkeeper.  Sadly, those lines were already used in the film's trailer and were basically good for nothing more than a quick chuckle.<br /><br />Regardless of this film's numerous shortcomings, there's a great deal to admire about Turbo's character.  He's an imaginative, driven character that shoots for the stars.  Still, his hardships in life feel a bit lackluster, making it hard to relate to the character - especially since his biggest disappointment is being unable to save a tomato from a lawnmower (yawn).  By sheer dumb luck, he winds up with these \\"Flash-like\\" powers from an accident and from there on out, it never feels like he's properly challenged.  As much as the plot tries to bring him down in order to build him back up for the climax, Turbo is essentially the Michael Jordan of snail racing (or Mario Andretti if you want to stick with racing) - without a proper \\"villainous\\" competitor.  And, by the time he does have a villain to compete with - the film is basically over and the interest level in the plot has long since faded.  Perhaps another super-powered snail would have made for a proper villain, instead of using the Indy 500 landscape and actual race cars.  Including the Indy car series just diluted the film even more, making it feel like a giant advertisement for the race (not to mention Chevy's logo is all over the film, too).<br /><br />The bright spot of the film is surely that quality of animation (plus the song selections are pretty excellent).  It never gets old seeing what these major animation companies can achieve with their authentic, yet cartoon-ish styles.  At certain points of the film (mainly during the racing scenes), if you had a controller in your hand, you'd swear you were playing a racing game on the big screen (which would be incredibly fun come to think of it).  Unfortunately, there's just something that's boring about starring at animated snails and a taco vendor for 90 minutes.  But, if you're someone that has ever dreamt of what a Fast & Furious animated feature would look like, the drag racing scene will at least feed your imagination in that regard.<br /><br />Overall, there's very little doubt that kids will find a great deal of enjoyment from this film and if you're a parent wondering whether this film is suitable for them - the easy answers is yes, absolutely.  As far as adults or teens go, there's hardly any humor or meaningful entertainment to be found in this flick.  This film is completely average - nothing more, nothing less.  Films like Despicable Me and Toy Story (which are the golden standard in animation if you haven't gotten that impression already) provide for a high to moderate amount of humor for both kids and adults.  In the case of Turbo, the entertainment value for adults just isn't there.  In the end, this film is strictly for kids through and through.  Walking out of the theater, it will be easy for most to label this film as \\"cute\\" and if you're a parent, you'll quickly come to the conclusion that one day this film will most likely be on your shelf collecting dust (along with the countless other animated movies) as soon as it hits home video.<br /><br />Grade:  C-<br />FNDNreview.comIncluding the Indy car series just diluted the film even more, making it feel like a giant advertisement for the race (not to mention Chevy's logo is all over the film, too).<br /><br />The bright spot of the film is surely that quality of animation (plus the song selections are pretty excellent).

B007URVZJ6|5.0|why bother with other books when you can learn from the authority. This book walks you through publishing every step of the way. If there is a negative, it's that the book is a little sterile--more of an instruction manual kind of a feel. But that said, it's a great resource
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Is working prefect. There was no problem. it was steal when i received it. keep doing a god job. Thank you
B006YTTVHO|3.0|It includes a few good tips and the best part is that's free.  I recommend it to those that constantly get stuck trying to figure out what to say in social gatherings.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is the funnest game ever, and it is so awesome that I could hug my horse to death over and over again.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|So far, this album has cost me over $600.00. Blew all the speakers in my truck, and I still can't get it to go loud enough to satisfy me. I can't pick a favorite song. If you like this particular style of music, these guys are the best group to hit the scene in a long long time. I have seen a lot of good entertainers in concert: AC/DC, Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, Brad Paisley, Hank Jr, Willie Nelson, Travis Tritt, and the list goes on. I enjoyed every one, but Blackberry Smoke is as good as any of them. If I am able, I plan to go see them for the fourth and fifth time during the next few months.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Fast-paced plot twists and turns kept me up way too late two consecutive nights!  A great summer read.  I highly recommended Gone for Good for any mystery lovers.  Coben's best yet.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|what's not to like about old school comic book super heroes. although hollywood does change some of the storytelling substantially, i still enjoyed the action very much.
B005LAII62|5.0|Rented this on a whim and am so glad I did. Let me say first that I am not into zombie movies at all, but immediately fell in love with Norman, and the message of the movie. Yes, some scenes would be too violent for younger kids but the story behind the story had some great lessons in it. My husband and I really enjoyed it.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I listen to this CD and I feel like I'm on vacation! You can hear his kindred spirit through his music, a kind and gentle soul.
B00785P2QC|3.0|fun enough for the kind of game it is. the buildings and landmarks are realistic.  not something I would play a lot.
B003L77G6A|5.0|It's the Big Bang Theory- what more can I say? I watch it when I'm alone and crack up out loud anyway!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little sharpener for the money and is handy to have.  Works on almost any knife you have in your home.
1400079144|4.0|I read the Robert Langdon series out of order, but I still liked them all.  This one is different in that it takes place entirely in DC.  Just like the others, the Lost Symbol is a very fast read, and when you think you've figured something out, there's a twist.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Had no idea what an unkind human being Steve Jobs was.  Great lessons on how not to be a boss!
B004J713JW|5.0|This is a landmark live recording. Billy Joel is as good as he ever was. The sound quality is stupendous! I have replayed the DVD at least four times and it just gets better! The only small criticism I have is the editor uses too many shots of the crowd. I don't go to concerts to see the crowd. I know they had only two performances to pull this together from, but crowd shots tend to be a lazy editors way to cover for no good shots. This is a small problem I find with most live performance  DVD's. With that one exception this is the best of the best.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Ok, so every kid likes legos. I mean, most adults still like legos. So why did it take them so long to make pink ones? I can't even imagine the money that could've been made over the years had Lego decided to cater to the girls 30 yrs ago. This is genius! I got it for a birthday gift, so I don't really know if the contents are skimpy or not, but who cares? IT IS PINK LEGO'S! Hopefully I don't find out that I wasted my money, but either way, my daughter has now been requesting some for herself, so I'm sure we'll be getting another brick
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Although it lags sometimes the graphics make up for it! I love this game it's super cute and it's definitely worth the download!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook is the EXACT SAME AS CALLING AND INVITING TELEMARKETERS TO YOUR HOME AND GIVING THEM YOUR PHONE #'S AND ASKING THEM TO CALL AT 3 A.M.<br /> They also Leech Mal ware, trackers and Hijackers to you system.  (Can you say VIRUS!)<br /><br /> How do you think it's free?? the Telemarketers and Virus Launchers pay them.<br /> There are Just too many people playing on it that don't know anything about Computers or worse they know enough to be dangerous and THINK they know.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Great writers! Great actors! Great music score! Everybody is slightly twisted which makes it all that more interesting & enjoyable!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very interesting book. I enjoyed it and could hardly put it down.  I thought it was for a younger audience but am in 60's and enjoyed it thouroughly.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I really liked this movie. The movie was very clear and audio was nice too. It was good to see so many big stars in one movie.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg provided real perspective on issues of the working woman. Hearing her personal account was surprising, challenging and inspirational. A great read for everyone!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Well, i went that far and woosh! It went in my mind&hellip;i should keep this game! It is fun, even my sister wants it so i share and now, she i very happy to play GET THIS GAME TELL THE WORLD and you will be my best friend
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|addictive and time consuming.fun mindless entertainment that keeps you coming back for more. you will be jumping with the lil guys as they try to dodge the cars lasers and other obstacles
B0083Z614S|5.0|I had to read this for school and I never knew it would be this fantastic. And it was free. Holler! Anyone would love this heart felt story
B009WUAK2M|5.0|It was a great movie, it does not take itself too seriously. I can't wait for the next one, 3.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|downloading is hard but the game is super fun i recommended for everyone if you don't have it get it now for free in app store
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I was a little confused when I opened the set and the dvds themselves say &#34;Disc 1 of 2&#34;. I know it wasn't the collectors addition with all of the extras but I would think the DVD wouldn't look like you picked it out of a 2 disc set and threw it in this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter has enjoyed playing this game!  It's very interactive, she keeps going back for more! Has kept her entertained as well.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very cute game, fun to play... Downside is that every time you start from the beginning. Perhaps multiple short stages would be more interactive.
B0028AQLYE|2.0|Before using the dry top, i was always getting water on the snorkel. Once I began using the dry top, can swim with the snorkel without getting water inside.<br /><br />Agree that restricts air intake; at the beginning it was uncomfortable, but now I'm used to that and found that it has helped to improve respiratory fitness.<br /><br />It has its shortcomings but serves its main purpose, to keep the water out of the snorkel.<br /><br />REVIEW: After using the dry too for several months, the floating \\"bullet\\" inside the device, that regulates the flow of air/water, got stuck and let the water in  and then kept the air out. I had to abruptly  stop swimming and remove the device.<br /><br />Maybe this situation is due to accumulation  of pool chemicals  and think that Finis should warn  about it and suggest ways to prevent and correct it.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|It was too chanllenging to install it on my Android phone. I tried hours and in many ways, but finally gave up.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I like the app and would love to keep on using it, but why do it need to e.g access my Contacts?
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Love the game. Can't wait to go further and save more animals. The graphics are awesome and the dinos are so cute
0525953590|5.0|Love this book. Is written in a way that even a non-physicist can understand. Gives me the history behind the particles.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Fell in love again with the original, again with my daughter who is now 20. We find ourselves singing the songs with the other kids in the family. Even without the movie! LOL
0061950726|5.0|Just finished reading this book and could not put it down.  Based on a history that is disturbing, this book creates true to life characters and dialogue that engages in every scene and moves fluidly from one time period to another.  I love and hate it when I finish a book and I am sad that it ended.  Orphan Train is one of those.  What is more, it was one of those books where I imagined scenes that were not really written in the book, but the writing sparked my imagination in all kinds of ways. Sequel please!
B004SDEP38|5.0|This app does exactly what it states. Works perfect for my s3 mini<br />Allows me to be productive on the go. You can view and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. Nice syncing features too!
B001N9BGGY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Before Sunrise and had my doubts that Before Sunset could be as good.  But it surprised me!  I enjoyed it even more.  The complexities of our changing relationships and the bumps along the way were captured well.  I saw both films in the theatre, 10 years apart.  But then recently, in preparation for seeing Before Midnight, watched both again as a double feature.  Wonderful surprises and connections between all three movies.  Don't see Before Midnight without seeing both of these back to back the day before or the same day that you go see Before Midnight.  Well worth it!  Before Midnight is tough to watch at times, but having the first two immediately in my mind really facilitated my enjoyment!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app does exactly what it states. Works perfect for my s3 mini.<br />Great app to transfer using wi-fi if you don't feel like hooking your phone up to your computer.
B001NA60A0|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out, but now having watched the trilogy (with Before Sunset and Before Midnight) I believe it captures well that indelible connection that we rarely find with another person.  This film captures it well in the brilliantly written dialogue and the engaging photography.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This app does exactly what it states. Works perfect for my s3 mini<br />Allows me to be productive on the go. You can view and edit Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. Nice syncing features too!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|To me better time watching than &#34;The Notebook&#34;. 2 hours of my life I'll never get back..At least this had zombies and  humor
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app does exactly what it states. Works perfect for my s3 mini.<br />This is a great app to remotely access your computer from your easy chair and act like you are in your computer chair.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Originally purchased the book when I heard rumors of it being made into a movie. More often than not the book is always better. Now I've read each book in the series! Science fiction fans should highly consider reading at least this single book in the series before they dismiss it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I LOVE IT !!! And the game is totally worth it. Plus its free . And it gets better because it's SUPER addicting. And you can't stop playing. And I totally LOVE the graphics the game is supper well done ^.^
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Black Keys have made another album worth listening from beginning to end, not just putting favorites into your shuffle.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Now THIS is the real vampire story. I read this to see how all the modern day YA vamp novels have changed the original ways of the vampire. And let me tell you, the Count didn't sparkle.<br />This is a good read for anyone wanting to understand true vampire-lore
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|Who told this man all of my excuses?? Well, he just way-laid every puny reason why &#34;I can't&#34;, before I had a chance to even think them. This is the first time I've ever enjoyed being chewed out, and I am really grateful for the opportunity to look into the way my brain has been wired to think &#34;poor&#34;.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who realizes that they are sabotaging their own success (and, if you ain't rich, you ARE the reason).<br />I will be reading this one over and over until my mind thinks like a millionaire!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I could relate a lot with this with the Catherine/Heathcliff love where it survives beyond death and the bitterness because of it. I always say I'm like Catherine and my boyfriend is a Heathcliff. :)
B004P1JDJO|5.0|An absolute must read. Pink gets his point across in a nice short book that I still cannot stop talking about. Reading this will make sense of not only yourself but everyone else around you.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|A friend of mine recommended that I HAD to read this before going to paris. (I was going in a few months)<br />I read a bit of it and loved it! But I had to return it to him for some reason.<br />Well, I went to Paris, came back and bought this as my first book on my kindle and finished it in like a day.<br />Its so good. :) I could understand perfectly because I've been to the places in the book, and I know what its like being abroad. fantastic book. Must Read.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Can't wait til next season to find out if the captain's ex-husband comes out of retirement to help find Maria's killer.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I've always love the movie but the book is even better! I never would have thought the story didn't end differently!
B003B02O14|5.0|An interesting peer into the thinking of a very clever lawyer!  This book keeps you guessing as to who knew what when and only barely hints at the ending.  I thought it was a great summer read.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I like this game but it takes 72 hours(3days)to get a peal. You have sanddollers Angels and peals. Well I keep playing and stills working fine. You should buy this game.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|Loved watching this with my 9-year old who read the book.  I cannot wait to see the other movies with her as she progresses through reading the series.
B000002UE2|5.0|I laid off purchasing this album for a while.<br />I'd thought Grand Funk had long passed their legendary live shows of the early 70's and were concentrating on pop songs.<br />While their albums lasked the power of the early ones this live album truly smokes.<br />The band is firing on all cylinders and I'm blown away from the concsistency in their &#34;Good singin'/Good Playin'&#34;<br />From the start of the one-two punch of Footstompin' Music/RocknRoll Soul to the encore of Gimme Shelter this album rocks!!
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 rocks.  I need to buy more of the albums.  I also like that I can listen on Amazon Cloud Player.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I was required to read this book but when I picked it up I couldn't stop reading everything a good book needs it has. Amazing story character development and even some mystery along with the fantasy action. I recommend it to all
B00AAZSH0U|5.0|Just long enough for a toddler, singsong text, rhyming pattern very nice. The illustrations are okay. I liked the book overall.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Good way to pass time.  A nice change of pace for a tower game. Don't have to pay extra to make it playable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game ever if you like despicable me then you will love this game it is the best game ever
B00C061I3K|5.0|Every time I listen to the album it sounds better.  Giorgio by Moroder is top class and actually motivating.  The album is a must in every mosic lover collection.
1451695195|3.0|I read it at the insistence of a family member who had experienced the loss of a loved one and was clinging to the hope of a life after death.<br /><br />It's moderately interesting, but if you read about similar experiences in the traditions of the non-theistic 'religions' like Buddhism and Taoism (Alan Watts is a good place to start if you're a newbie.), you quickly discover that to get hung up on 'proof' is to miss the point of the experience.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|THIS BOOK HAD ME AT THE EDGE OF MY SEAT!!! It was the it third person book that I enjoyed!!! Cassandra Clare is a genius and I can't wait to see what happens in City of Ashes!! I'm so excited for the movie (hopefully it's exactly like the book!!!!).
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|get Candy Crush for the Kindle Fire already. The wait is getting ridiculous and the copy cat games all stink big time. What's the problem with giving customers what they obviously want? SO FRUSTRATING!!!
0345529057|5.0|It is a must read book series. Plots and characters are very worthy to read. Anticipated what is going to happen next and you find out different.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|This book was a big disappointment .  I enjoyed the first two books of this series and expected the same from Best Kept Secret. Unfortunately it seemed like Archer took the easy way out and used a predictable and uninspired plot. By the time he wrote this book he apparently grew tired of his characters and made them far less interesting than in his other books. Spoiler:<br /><br />The ending was completely in satisfying and left me shaking my head in disbelief.
6305882592|5.0|I had seen the movie when it first came out so was delighted to see it on DVD.  If you like Ruth Gordon, you'll love her in this role.  A very quirky, unusual love story- to each his own.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is really cool. Just the best game ever!  I love it because it's the right amount of scary.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|this movie totally deserved all the hype and publicity that it received! the performances by natalie portman and mila kunis are incredible and the symbolism throughout the film enraptures you... the duality of mila's raw sexuality v. natalie's restrained sense of control, mila's easy self-confidence v. natalie's crippling self-doubt and obsession with perfection, i could go on and on
B001QXZ81G|5.0|Perfect story with a great soundtrack, one of the best movies of the 80's.  It really needs a bluray/cd release.....!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't been reading for quite awhile. When I was reading regularly, I consumed books from many authors. Having been a member of more than one book club, I amassed an impressive bookcase full of books. Stephen king was the biggest single contributor. I am now reading on an Ipad, using the Kindle app. I didn't think I could make the transition but stories like this have helped. This story was so well written, it held me tethered to this machine until the battery would run down. More than once, I found myself reading while the Ipad was plugged into the wall with a ridiculously short charging cord. I won't comment on anything written in the story because any amount of description could be a spoiler. All I can say is that it was written beautifully.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Heart-warming, funny, and lots of great characters! I know kids, 20somethings, and senior citizens that all loved it!  It's really a good-for-all-audiences film.
B00AAZSH0U|4.0|Awesome book!  Always loved it.  On Kindle, however, without the pages, you'll need to pace yourself, and the &#34;surprises&#34; are more easily revealed.  Get the book, though, hardback or Kindle!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Great page turner.  I am a huge Jeffrey Archer fan.  Hope it is not a long  wait for the next &#34;CLIFTON CHRONICALS&#34;!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|my only wish is that, this product along with the power fast charger originally comes with the kindle fire device, as i had to unfortunately go through 2 kindle chargers before receiving this blessing, all's well that ends well
B004SDSSFY|5.0|great app with all the features that you need for an on the go document reader and/or editor.<br />would highly recommend,
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is well written, well acted, and well filmed.  The third season is full of happy and sad. The end will have you in tears.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This ebay app makes keeping up with buying or selling on ebay so easy even on my iphone or kindle fire.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Disney animated movies are either a hit or a miss for me. I gave this 4 stars because I believe children probably enjoy the movie, as its target audience isn't geared towards adults. I'm in my 20s with no kids so I just watch animated movies for myself, so if you're like me then the $4 is a fair bet that its worth that for an evening of entertainment, but don't buy it. If you have kids, I'm sure they would enjoy Wreck-It Ralph.
B000EUDAWG|3.0|You my god! Socks! I'm so excited about socks, I just had to write this review.  I mean come on there socks for Christ sack.  How can you not get excited.  I've practically got a chubby over here thinking about all these clothed foot coverings.  I can't imagine people not writing countless reviews about these wonderful inventions that have just been recently employed in modern society.  I love socks.  Almost as much as Jesus himself.  In fact, do you have a minute?  I'd like to talk to you about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

B00A83075M|5.0|Bought this for my husband for his Birthday. He's not an avid gamer, but loves the classics... he thought it was great!
B00AVFO41K|1.0|Couldn't figure out the purpose of the game again no purpose just stupid didn't make any since just like this review..
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I really loved this book. As a spiritual person, Alexander's book spoke deeply to me. I've discussed this book with so many other people who feel similarly.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I could play this game for hours if my wrist wasn't hurt it is fun and everyone who has played it loves it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not a zombie or horror enthusiast - so I resisted all the hype about this show for a long time.  I finally decided to watch a few episodes and was instantly enthralled.  I am now counting the days until the new season is on AMC.  This show is so much more than zombies- it is about the value of life, how we define humanity, trust, morality when there are no rules.  Fascinating and such great entertainment!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|The graphics in this game are the best I've seen on Android, and the monkeys are adorable! This is definitely one of the best Free Apps of the Day in a while.
B00AM0C6YG|4.0|I really really enjoy the songs Like the Morning Dew and Can't Live With the World. Those are the songs that drew me to wanting to buy this CD.  It's definitely a mash-up of different sounds and I like the experimental element of that.  The other songs are growing on me.  I really want to appreciate all the songs on here, not just a few, so I am listening to it intently and finding the beauty in each song.  I have to say though I'm really disappointed that Jump Right Out is not on this CD.  I don't understand why they would leave out a song that can only add to the luster of album.  I fell for that song along with the two I mentioned in the beginning of this review and I just find it baffling that it would be left off the album.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved the app Can You Escape,but it only had 10 levels. After I beat all the levels I replayed all of them and then just deleted the app because I saw no point why to have it. So if you're looking for a new,fun,challenging game this is the one. But beware it only has 10 levels. Im just glad it's free.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Like others have said, 1 star is 1 too many.  This was the first app I downloaded 18 months ago and I loved it, it was the first thing I opened every day.  That is until last week.  I find the changes are unnecessary and complicated.  I go out to see the current temperature and forcast.  Now I have to see advertisements changing along the bottom of the screen.  But the worst part is the annoying pictures.  With the format changed they added 'background pictures' and the words, which are in white type, blend into the white clouds and background colors. Isn't there anyone looking at these things before they force them on us? Also, it always had up-to-the minute data and now it is usually about 20 minutes old. And points???  What purpose does that serve.  I want the weather not another game.  I will be looking for a new weather app.
B00DB97LCM|1.0|So the same old discs re-released now for the third/fourth time?---with so-so trnafers and no deleted scenes and no Director's cuts? Shameless.........
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Paired with my Thundbolt monitor, I can now charge my Air and Retina using the Thunderbold monitor cable.  Nice adapter
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I was expecting a lot funnier movie....story line is very slow and boring, was looking for more of what Knocked Up was like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game.love how they change the setting of game to different parts of the world.hope they make the game even better
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I use to play magic a lot, but haven't in about 3 years. So when I found the app I was excited to start playing again. Now it's easier to find people to play against. And I like the story you follow in campaign mode.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am a Downton items.  I love it, even when it devolves into soap opera.  It is my soap opera.  The production values and research are stunning. The actors (with the exception of Cora and her mother, who are annoying)  are fabulous (what other word is applicable to Dame Maggie?). and the story lines are constantly in support of strong female characters making their way through a dynamic time in history (in exquisite costumes, of course).  The last episode of this season includes wonderful Scottish music and dance,  okay, and a cheap ending that left me feeling betrayed.  However, my loyalty could not be shaken.  Join us Downton Abbotts.  Resistance is futile.
0345529057|5.0|Good. No editing problems whatsoever. Decent quality.<br />Ink smears a little, as with all mass quantity paperbacks.<br />But, despite rumors to the contrary, the pages were all in order and everything was great.<br /><br />Should've included the 5th book as it's timeline runs concurrent with the 4th but whatever.<br />Good deal. Would recommend if you like Martin's work.
0226443221|4.0|It's interesting and very informative.still reading though . In the beginning a bit slow but then it picks up especially in the detail about public administrators records etc great read all my colleagues want to read it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Lots of fun! Got my mind thinking in different directions which is great brain exercise! Will definately recommend to friends and family!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesomly cute and funny! It gives my kids and i hours of entertainment. I would definitely recommend this app to anybody
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Choose Yourself makes an excellent case for taking the leap and prioritizing your own passions rather than slogging away building someone else's. It's always been a good idea to choose yourself but James makes a really good case for why the 2008 downturn and subsequent &#34;recovery&#34; should be a wake up call for everyone.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I love the different and high quality things I buy on Amazon. It is truly amazing to be able to shop from home  and also get such value at the same time.
B003ELOQCK|5.0|excellent
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I ordered this game yesterday and I love it I have one little sister and a little brother and a big brother and they fight over who is playing this game first. I nearly have enough time to go through one game before it dies on me so make a time limit for them.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|good
B007VDN1PA|2.0|This unit doesn't feed film properly or easily.  I have over two thousand slides to sort and store on my computer.  This product is overpriced and didn't meet my needs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|could hardly finish it because of that....how in hell did this catch on?  It wasn't the subject matter, as a writer of spicy romance, sexual violence is simply not my thing.  The characters were implausible and the dialogue stupid.  It did, however, spank the taboos in the publishing world.  NY Times best seller list for smut is a real break-through.
037571457X|4.0|In one word: Poignant.<br /><br />For anyone that does not like to approach nonfiction should give Persepolis a chance. It's an interesting look into Iranian culture during the Islamic Revolution. In this edition of Persepolis, the young Marji learns many lessons about life and her culture. She has a unique family situation, so she is raised a bit differently than her peers. Her life experiences and observations help show an outsider what it was like growing up in Iran during this time.<br /><br />I will admit, I do not know much about the Islamic Revolution or Iraq's invasion of Iran in the 1970s. That was way before my time and I was just a kid in the 1980s. Needless to say, this story was fascinating for me. I was instantly engrossed with what was happening around Marji and within the walls of her home.<br /><br />Like all graphic novels, there are many details left out. As a reader, you were left filling in the gaps with what was happening outside of her home. Since she was a young child during this time, the information is shared in the perspective of a young child. The adults in her life were the real enlightenment.<br /><br />I loved the author's humor. Information was given, but it was sprinkled with a kind of wit and insight that made me connect instantly with what was being shared. I could not put this book down, and I consider it a must read.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Im at work a lot (desk job) but a few weeks ago made a decision that I wanted to do something....anything...to exercise, and for the last two weeks straight I have used this app just before bed. I spend 5-10 minutes and I already feel better about my routine. I don't find exercising very entertaining but this allows such short reps that before I even know it the 5 minutes is up.
0375714669|5.0|Marjane is back and older in Persepolis 2. Now that she is living and attending school in Austria, she has a whole new set of problems to deal with. I have to admit that I realized how selfish I could be when I read her story this time around. It has never occurred to me how lonely it would be to be surrounded by people that I have nothing in common with culturally. I've never lived abroad in a country that does not speak my language, so this situation never crossed my mind. However, reading what Marji went through during her high school years, I was shocked by how easy it would be to disappear among a crowd.<br /><br />The author did a great job of taking what was probably a retched time in her life and making it both humorous and believable. She did not take away from her experiences with her witty remarks, but she did not share all of the gut-wrenching details either.<br /><br />What I found myself really enjoying this time around is how Marji both lost and found herself between the pages of Persepolis 2. It was also an eye opener in that I now understand why some cultures are so against the West and our \\"decadence\\" after seeing the extent Marji went to fit in. It must be a horrible feeling to lose what makes you you in order to fit in, only to find that you still don't truly belong. (Okay, to be fair, don't most teenagers go through some extent of this growing up? I know it's part of the process, but Marji went through an extreme version.)<br /><br />But Marji has amazing parents that realize she is the daughter they raised. She is outspoken, independent, and not a coward. Marji just needed a bit of a push to remember that. When she does realize her place and purpose in the world, she becomes an amazing force. I really wish this story continued on because I want to know more. I was just in awe the entire time. I could write more, but I would start babbling over all the connections and comments I wrote down while reading. The pages were filled with insight, but it wouldn't be fair to try to squeeze it all into a few paragraphs in this review. Again, just like with Persepolis, this is a must read.t wouldn't be fair to try to squeeze it all into a few paragraphs in this review. Again, just like with Persepolis, this is a must read.
1932907009|5.0|Taking the essential &#34;How To&#34; book and amending it &#34;How To Do It Well&#34;, Save the Cat teaches us to write the same thing, only different.  I hope this review qualifies.
B005CAATXG|5.0|A friend posted a link to one of Icon for Hire's videos on Facebook. I clicked over and fell instantly in love with the song \\"Off with Her Head\\" and after checking out a few other songs, came right here and bought the album.<br /><br />Of course, some songs on the album I love better than others, but I can honestly say there's not a single one that's not awesome.
B000FC10HA|5.0|I wrote down the 22 laws, provided a one sentence example of each in the real world market, and printed them.  I bought picture frames and have them hung up on the wall of the marketing department.  Don't think you can market successfully without thorough knowledge of these 22 laws.  Better still, go ahead and try; I'll be there to take away your market share.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Landay has done a remarkable job of combining  mystery,  courtroom drama, and all the  accompanying emotions that are involved in a murder trial.  The ending is a total shocker--but perfectly illustrates the immense devastation to the families and friends of  all parties involved in a homicide and the resulting trial.  Great  Book-- I strongly recommend this book to all!
B006M3JVD6|5.0|Such a brave story. You can't enjoy it because it's horrible. But you can admire the author's strength and hope and it was this that made the book great to read.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|A great way to keep informed minute to minute,jut a click of the button and good to go and keep checking
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I never knew about the book until the movie was made. The book was Ok to read. Not my usual cup of tea. I prefer rock music, drug addicts, groupies and comedy.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I started playing this game as a recommendation from a friend. it's like Sim City crossed with Jurassic Park. You build up little areas for your dinosaurs. The game is fun, but the adds are incredibly annoying and the game crashes reasonably often.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|Saw the movie first, then read the book and loved it much more than the movie. So glad I got to read this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app for everyone especially me I love  despicable me 1 and 2 and I love minions there so cute recommend this app to everyone !!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008S4FZ6E|5.0|Recommend it. A great read. Andy Taylor's book is good too. John was my favourite so I'm biased. Couldn't put the book down.
B004SDEP38|1.0|this wouldn't load on my device - I just kept being directed back to the purchase page - wasted 30 minutes before getting another app to do the same job
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I don't know why, but this game is very fun. It's good to play if you have nothing to do, are bored, or just wanna play a game. It's simple, and fun to see those giant coins fall from the sky! I recommend getting this  game!
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I love Dr. Who, who doesn't?  Stay Calm and watch the next disc of Dr. Who with pleasure and a bowl of popcorn.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Takes a little while to download but very fun game!!! Highly recommended. Great when need to pass the time. My son loves it.
1781162646|4.0|From the gorgeously cheesy, over-saturated pulp fiction cover, to the magical way King weaves character poetry with such simple words and with so seemingly little effort, this is a wonderful book. If you've never read Stephen King or think you know King as only horror writer - it's time to think again. What's amazing is how truly little actually happens in this book by thriller standards, yet you can't wait to pick it up and read some more. The story contains only moments of spookiness, has no over-the-top violence (very little at all, really), a moderate amount of swearing, but hey, it's about twenty-something carnies in the 70's - so you gotta expect some of that. It all just feels very real... and very human... and has characters that actually find beauty in the simple things of life.<br /><br />What shines is how well he brings to life the characters and how his writing provides occasional glimpses into the real greatness and grace of humanity - not what you'd expect from a \\"horror\\" writer. Mostly it's just about a small group of kids trying to find their way in life amongst the setting of the amusement park where they all worked one summer. The \\"mystery\\" part almost seems to be a side note.<br /><br />At the nearly half-off price Amazon is selling this for, stop researching and just buy the darn thing. Unless you're looking for a scary, gory thriller (which this isn't), I think you're going to enjoy it.<br /><br />I stop short of giving it a 5-star rating only because I'm stingy with 5-star book ratings and, while wonderful, I could have used just a little more suspense and spookiness in this tale.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun and creative I love playing this funny excitement<br />I love the funny  power ups and clothes and the tasks.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Awesome! I love everything about this show. Its funny and also has interesting character relationships. Rock paper scissors lizard Spock!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is awesome worth the 499. Great game recommend you get it. The one thing I wish was different is the monster truck not so much. Other wise great game.
B0058BI896|5.0|Awesome! I love everything about this show. Its funny and also has interesting character relationships. Rock paper scissors lizard Spock!
B00BU18U82|4.0|This game is a some. This game makes it feel like you own your own farm. It is cool driving the tractors all around the town and getting fuel and seeds. The one thing I don't like is if you go around a turn to sharp you get clipped. Over all best game I ever paid for.
B001FB55YE|5.0|When this movie came out I kinda overlooked it. Finally sat down, and watched it. Loved it, and decided to add it to my blu-ray collection. Very underrated Guy Ritchie film...
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game has great potential if it didn't stutter the whole time your running other wise it would be a pretty good game.
B0011B8W6G|5.0|This is Jack's sophmore album.  It has a great vibe through the whole album.  Every track is great.  I would recommend this album if you have never heard any of his other albums.  On and On is the album that was made right before he started getting really popular.  Brushfire Fairy tales and On and On are the two albums of Jack with just himself adam and merlow.  It has less instruments and more of a intimate sound (before Zach Gill joined on).  It does though have the signature steel drums.  I have listened to this album over a hundred times and still love it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb racing is a great. It is fun trying beat your record and not run out of gas too. I think you should get this.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Great acting. Great story. Love it. One of the best shows on television--heck, better than any super hero movie this year.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Loved it ! Glad I finally saw it. WOW ! Yes - I do highly recommend it for anyone that is into great science fiction and into a little bit of a love story to it  : )
B00004CZIZ|4.0|I ordered this and thought I had checked the listing to see if it was region 1...I was wrong.  It's region 2, played it on my laptop so no worries.  I wish Amazon would have made the region listing more prominent, but it could as easily been my old eyes.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I lived through much of this era, and this book reminds me of how easy it would be for it all to happen again. Lest we forget . . .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a very good game needs to have more levels. I completed to soon. Only other negative is that some objects are hard to see.
B003X8597K|1.0|Rienzi's rants look like propaganda rallies in films of the Third Reich, disturbing in light of Wagner's well documented anti-Jewish sentiments.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Loved the performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. Just the right balance of humor and drama. Not Oscar- worthy, but definitely worth watching.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's ok not as fun as running with friends would be nice to be less of a pain to play
B007V4530A|3.0|Your first presentation probably isn't going to be a TED Talk, but this is a Presentation 101 handbook and covers all of the things every great presenter should know (but most don't). Donovan has reviewed and analysed many successful TED presentations as the basis of his book, but these rules fit any presentation ...
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|Personally, Samantha barks is a great singer but seems to lack the abilities and strength the song requires to sing this song unlike lea Salonga, who's rendition I much more prefer.<br />Thankyou

B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Missing all the lead in stuff and skipped constantly for the 30 minutes I tried to watch it. Returned for credit. At least the return policy is good.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|My daughter got same or similar app on google play for free. I paid for this one. Same features as this one.

B004EPYZQC|4.0|It is entertaining just like the other parts with action and fast cars. The storyline is good with over the top action. Take it for a ride;)
B000YXMMAO|5.0|Great quality press!<br /><br />Great packaging!<br /><br />Absolutely gorgeous sound, nice quality inserts<br /><br />Very , very, well pressed.<br /><br />Absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
159463176X|4.0|This was definitely worth reading! A good book with a lot of depth and fantastic descriptions. Nevertheless, I think that his other books may have been a little more captivating.
B00846REIS|5.0|Wonderful Trilogy!!! Can not wait for the next book in the series! Read the first 3 in a couple of days and I am counting the days till November when book #4 comes out!!!!!
0525478817|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was funny, sad, frustrating, happy and realistic all at the same time. Totally worth reading!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is well designed and fun to play. I hope it doesn't take long for new round to be created.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I loved it! I enjoyed the original Star Trek--and found the &#34;new&#34; Star Trek fantastic. Loved the cast & the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really fun game.<br />You should buy its FREE.<br />Perfect right!<br />Your a yellow dude.<br />It's hard but SUPER FUN!!!<br />Have fun playing it.<br />Oh yeah one more thing don't wast your dude bucks OK.
B002ZG99G8|3.0|This movie will entertain as long as you know what you are getting. This movie didn't really break new ground but it is a fun addition to the genre.<br />This movie has largely been overlooked but I feel this could be due to it being released a few weeks after The Expendables.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This would be a five star if it was not for the fact that it seems to be more of a cash grab.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game it's funny entertaining and just an all around great game my kids 3 5 &amp;7 love watching me play when they aren't playing
0060254920|1.0|A disturbed young man in a devilish costume chases a dog with a sharp object, then threatens to cannibalize his mother when she objects. No, it's not an episode of \\"True Blood\\". This is actually the opening scene of an inexplicably beloved children's book, and that's just for starters. The boy, Max, conjures up an imaginary sailboat and sails to an imaginary island inhabited by demonic horned beasts. Max watches as the monsters \\"gnash their terrible teeth\\" (a descriptor Jesus used in the Bible when describing Hell). Using some form of dark \\"magic\\", Max wins a staring contest and is anointed \\"king\\" of the creatures, then initiates an eerie moonlight dancing ritual. Curiously, at its conclusion, he arbitrarily deprives the monsters of nourishment, although we're not privy to the reason for the punishment. (Yeah, I get it, he's emulating his mom's behavior but now from a position of power himself... but as a kid, I just felt sorry for the beasts and thought Max a cruel tyrant.) Finally Max gets hungry and decides to leave the imaginary world, as the demon-spawn horde promise to cannibalize him if he'll only stay a bit longer. He arrives back in his bedroom and finds a hot dinner awaiting him -- his reward, evidently, for his earlier attempts to cannibalize Mom and Fido. I just realized, this is probably my first review in which I've used the word \\"cannibalize\\" three times.<br /><br />Now before you comment, look folks -- I have no objection to \\"dark\\" children's books. In fact, I can tell you that kids find this stuff a lot less scary than we as adults insist they should. Children's imaginations are generally a lot \\"darker\\" than anything we can show them. I love Maurice Sendak's artwork, and I appreciate that as an author he doesn't \\"talk down\\" to children. That said, other than the illustrations, I just don't see the appeal of this book. It didn't do anything for me when I was a kid, when I thought Max seemed mean and obnoxious, and the \\"wild things\\" rather insane andcertainly untrustworthy, as they never stopped threatening to consume Max. Even though as an adult I now understand the symbolism and themes, there's nothing about it that's \\"fun\\".
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book was as good as the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  It kept me wanting to go on to the next chapter.  Didn't put it down much during my free time.  Loved the connection among the characters.  Wish it would have ended a little more positively.  Good summer read.
B00AK57N00|1.0|I found the physics too easy and the game too repetitive. Perhaps I didn't go into high enough levels but it didn't seem to get more interesting. I deleted it the same day I got it.
B006O7XOOW|3.0|This was just ok. We thought it would pop the balls in the air (neighbor has one that does that). They just roll down the sides. Baby likes it, it plays music and she'll dance but it's sort of boring otherwise.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I have been trying to break level 10 it seems like forever.  I had no trouble with finding gems on the other levels but just cant figure out where they are.  Plus, sometimes when I swipe my Kindle, the image freezes and I have to 'quit' and start over.  So frustrating.  Any suggestions for finding gems?
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love it baby really like it it's fun in the sun try it try it you'll enjoy it thank u
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Everything about this game is fun. The skill tree and the fact it doesn't beg for extra money. The levels are very creative and some very difficult. Would recommend to anyone.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all the Jack Ryan novels and I loved all. I recommend this new book to all the Tom Clancy readers.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A wonderful story of family and found happiness. A heart warming story told only the way an IRish lass could tell.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really nice and good for all ages but it is difficult at some places. It also I like a remake minion style of temple run.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Brings back memories of my childhood. Would like to see it in 3D if it's available. Love all Robert Downey Jr. action movies.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The app makes it fun, quick and easy. The app is good, I would always like to use this app. This app is cool to everyone I know, but some people don't use it. But for me it's fun and easy.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|It is worth spending the 3 bucks on upgragding from the free version, the binural beats are much more complete, and WHALE SOUNDS, YEAH! FRICKEN WHALE SOUNDS!!! Worth it.
B00CFQN12Q|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. I loved the first three in the series and the last one wasn't too bad, but this one was just not up to par.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've been searching for Season 3 and was so happy to find that Amazon had it. I hooked it up to my TV and was hooked for 9 straight episodes.<br />The show really stepped up the drama in season 3, in my opinion they maybe went a bit far. Some things happened that I'm still angry about, but I'll be back for season 4 regardless. Great show!
B00B0ND67K|5.0|If you are a fan of Kenny Loggins' solo career, you may be initially resistant to the country influence on this new album.  You owe it to yourself to give Blue Sky Riders a chance and a second listen (although it only took once for me).  Kenny Loggins has made a great decision to work with two other terrific songwriters, Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr.  The talent in this trio really shines in this album.  The vocal harmonies are very appealing, and Georgia's voice is especially captivating.  The album is full of energy and has a very optimistic tone.  Dream is an inspirational anthem, especially for those of us who have passed midlife but still have plenty of aspirations and expectations.  Kenny said at their season opening concert at the Britt Festival that he began writing it after being told by record execs that he was too old to start a new band.  He's not.  I'm a Rider is a very catchy tune showcasing their harmonies (been singing it in my head for over a week); it is Top Ten material if someone will give them an opportunity.  I'm Feeling Brave and Little Victories are other standouts, but honestly most of the songs are quite good.  Plus they all seem like down-to-earth people who are genuinely happy to be performing.  Try to see them in concert this summer; you'll enjoy them.
B004I654WQ|5.0|This is a great movie. The story is fun, heartwarming & has a great lesson. The music and animation are right on target!
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|A very strange, unique and entertaining animated film.<br /><br />The script was very creative and it was a nice change from the usual crime dramas I watch so much of.
B000QUCPWU|5.0|\\"Time is Tight\\" reaches deep inside my heart and grabs an emotion I have yet to define. It is powerful!
B002ZM74Y6|4.0|Acting was superb.  The action was throughout.  Good story.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci played almost the same characters in Casino.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoy the story between Ana and Christian. It's romantic, sexy and mysterious, can't wait to read the 3rd book!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Reviewing this is kind of like reviewing a cable...I plugged it in and it worked!!  Not much else to say, other than it'd be nice if it had a tether of some sort so that it would stay on the cable when it pops off.  That said, it does what it's supposed to!
B007PT1PEY|3.0|Cannot really give it a fair review...have not read it yet.  Purchased but I just cannot get into. It does not hold my interest
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The original 3 still hold up great, especially on blu-ray. The 4th one...well, it looks good, so it's got that going for it. Just can't get past nukin' the fridge....
B00D2ZF24O|4.0|For what it's worth, I highly enjoyed this movie. That being said, I did have to go and see it at the dollar theater since no one wanted to go and see it with me at a regular theater due to its bad reviews. I'm not sure where those reviews came from, to be honest.<br /><br />Is this Will Smith's best movie? Absolutely not - don't even bother seeing it if you don't want to see W. Smith in anything less than a star role. He's relegated to an auxiliary character in this film. But it's very interesting to see him play such a character; he's not doing his traditional comedy or action hero. Here he's a strict, dignified, stoic military man who's desperately trying to keep him and his son alive after their space ship crashes to Earth, which has been destroyed and abandoned by humans and then reclaimed by nature. And yes, the introduction is a bit abrupt - but if they'd given no background information it'd be really confusing. As it was, it was enough to get the stage set.<br /><br />To those critics claiming Jaden Smith's acting is terrible - remember, he's playing a teenager who's constantly living in fear and probably has some anxiety and post traumatic stress disorders running through his head all the time. Yes, his voice is a bit stilted at times and he's overdramatic...But this is quite believable, given Kitai's back story and personality. In my opinion, it worked.<br /><br />I was hesitant about M. Night directing this movie - in general, I'm not a fan of his work. This movie, however, was a delight to both watch and observe. The images of Earth after humans are gone are beautiful. I wish I could have seen it in imax! That would've been awesome. My only main critique is that the ship seems to land in a deciduous forest biome and quickly progresses to a tropical biome and then to a volcanic, snowy wasteland. While I understand that this is a post-apocalyptic world, it seems more like they were just trying to incorporate as much cool scenery as possible.<br /><br />Allin all, if you really want to go and see this movie or buy it, I would encourage you to do so. Don't let the critics or people who expect nothing but constant explosions, curse words and fighting sequences dissuade you from seeing this. It is a different kind of action movie than you're used to with Will Smith, but it is still quite a good movie even if it isn't perfect. Give it a chance - even if it is through Red Box or the $5 movie bin!
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|This album is upbeat and edgy with heart! So much fun you won't be able to stop listening. Truly one of their best musical achievements yet!
0062238868|5.0|Every guy that's a real guy should read this.  I would buy it again and will get his latest as soon as possible.
B00007KWHG|5.0|All the best songs are on this CD.  Glad I bought it.  Enjoying it.  Brings back a lot of memories of days gone by.
B0058SNI94|5.0|Everything is perfect about these shoes! Durable and comfortable! And I love that I got them for 20 bucks! Thank you!
B008220BP2|3.0|Rent it or wait until it's cheap to buy it. I pre-ordered this item when it was at the movies. It was ok, not great not bad, just ok.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I liked the book but I wish there were fewer characters and more depth to the people who told the story.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Was bored on a Sunday afternoon and started to watch these episodes.  I was hooked and watched the whole first season in 2 days!
0425263924|4.0|I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who was expecting this to wrap up a trilogy. And while I am frustrated, I have to say I'm not really disappointed because that means there are more to come. (According to Day's website this is now a quintet.) I find myself liking Eva and Gideon a little more with each novel and I crave more of their story. I'm amazed that Day is able to carry a single romance story through 3 books without it feeling at all stale . . . she keeps introducing more challenges from their pasts (and present) that keep the back-and-forth struggle of their romance both exciting and believable. I would still recommend this series.
0307272702|5.0|Great read, interesting subjects to look into. Also has suggestions on how to find low carb foods. Very though provocative IMO and enjoyed the read.
1439153663|5.0|I really cannot believe that this is Kathleen Grissom's first novel. She captured my attention from the first page, and developed beautiful and complex characters. This book definitely covers some very difficult and painful events, but I appreciate how the author conveys these events without becoming overtly explicit.
B000LB7G00|5.0|Awesome mouse, especially for the entry-level CAD user. Nice feel, great control, and two buttons to keep your hand on the controller. Worth the cost if you're going to be doing some CAD from time to time.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I always get the most accurate weather from this app.  I like that I can view the weather for state or region.  Great app!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I love the game. It`s fun and moderately challenging. Just the thing for hours of fun. I hope there are going to be additional levels.
B007FEZQF8|3.0|Okay, I enjoyed reading the story.  That was good.  Too short, but that's what you get for being a fast reader.<br /><br />However reading this on Kindle did NOT wow me (especially because my kids won't fork over the actual Kindle Fire, forcing me to read on my Android Phone!).  I think I'm going to go actual books for graphic novels.
078401213X|5.0|Ever wonder why the CGI boy-in-boat-with-tiger movie was even made? 'Life of Pi'...what is up with that?<br />For the psyops-savvy esoteric minded, this movie is the answer.<br />It attempts to mystify with woo the corruption of Wall Street preparing for a historic fleecing in the middle of a military war game turned real world event by a cabal of rogue insiders on 9/11/01. There's a finale involving a 'drill.' And ' lack of intelligence.'<br />Classic steganography for the large covert class of psyoperators and their military handlers.<br />See 'short-selling' and 'Deutsche Bank' and 'CIA's Alvin Bernard 'Buzzy' Krongard.'
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|This is one fantastic series.  Watch season 1 & 2 in about 4 days and I am watching season 3 now.  Can't wait till fall for season 4.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a great read and a quick read. The book stays true to what it's like to not be a popular kid in high school and all of the challenge.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Watched season 1 & 2 in about 4 days.  Glad I found season 3 here on Amazon, watching 1 episode a night to string it out.  Can't wait till Fall for season 4.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesomeness!!!! So much fun and it definitely will keep you on your toes. Great way to pass the time. I'd recommend it kids and those who are kids at heart :)
B00BSBY38A|5.0|It was a fabulous movie.  I loved it all.  Some movies you get board in parts of it, this one kept me wanting more.  I felt bad when the movie ended I wanted to see more.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was the third book I read by Gillian and all three I enjoyed can't wait for more. I love how they all keep you guessing on the conclusion
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|It was a good movie just took to long to get to the point.  I got board after an hour.  Ok movie.
B009J2VR3Y|1.0|Love the CD in terms of song selection. But it's such a shame the audio quality is very very poor. Poor mastering levels etc. unacceptable for any audiophiles
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I could watch it daily if I had a choice.  I have seen them all but this season the most.
1451695195|5.0|This is a phenomenal story told by a scientist and a non-believer, which makes the account so much more powerful. I appreciated the explanations of the various non-metaphysical possibilities for Dr. Alexander's experience, and the scrupulous research which led to his incredible and believable conclusion (as per the title).
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|My toddler really enjoyed this movie.  She thought the characters were fun to watch.  I personally thought it was cute also.  I would recommend this movie.
