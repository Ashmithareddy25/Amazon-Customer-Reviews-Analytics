B009WO7NQO|4.0|I got this for my grandson.  He is very good at it.  I'm not so good, but I didn't get it for me.  I got it for the kids.
B005544V6A|5.0|There is altogether too many tv shows to choose from that my head spins so that sometimes little gems like this show never even are on my radar.  Thank goodness for Amazon prime, where I could allow myself the pleasure of watching two full seasons for free.  i hated playing Monopoly when I was a kid because of all the other players became such sharks.<br /><br />And here they are, all grown up and such fun to watch ... but I could never get in the water with them ... ever.<br /><br />And that's okay.
B009C7JS14|5.0|This is a nice app. It works great and has beautiful pictures.  I love it.  I think you will too, just try it<br />Revised:<br />Ok, now I have had time to play with this app, I changed my mind.<br />It only does a gp address and when you live in the boonies that could be a few towns away.  If you try to put your town you have to buy the full app.  So I went back to the weather channel app. You can have several towns on that one. I don't need that but if you do. Say if your going away you might want to know what the weather will be like.<br />Sorry if I misled you but it is free and is pretty.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a fan of Downton abbey from the very first episode!<br />  I wish that Matthew was not killed (perhaps hurt bad.....)  because I was so delighted that he and Mary finally<br />acknowledged their love for each other!<br />Keep the series coming!

B000002P7R|4.0|Standouts: SAM'S DICE, PALI GAP, TAX FREE, the \\"alternate mix\\" of ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER, and the lead number, LOOK OVER YONDER, actually a pre-Experience composition, with some amazing syncopation, and the \\"feel\\" of JH's HOUSE BURNING DOWN.<br /><br />I'm not the expert to say what coulda-shoulda been *originally* released. I can only say that I have never heard a bad Hendrix/Hendrix related track...going back to 1964. This CD carries on that tradition. This Reviewer is not disappointed with even one second of sound on SSD. (Athough, I'm still looking for the easiest way to play a A-flat chord, on my student model folkie).<br /><br />It seems that mere seconds after his distinguished R & B Sideman period, which ended, say very early 1966, with a reported brief return to Little Richard, at a recording session for a minor LR hit, POOR DOG (WHO CAN'T WAG HIS OWN TAIL), he exploded in otherworldly creativity, playing a lightning speed, and generating atmospherics long before the Moody's Mello-tron. ( But there's plenty of roots blues here).<br /><br />If some of the bits and pieces beg for the closure they didn't get...keep in mind that this entire CD is uplifting and inspiring. Not only for those whose guitar has 5 strings and is tuned upside down - and carried in a potato sack.<br /><br />If this CD only serves the purpose of inspiring a replay of Electric Ladyland, then it lands proudly near the top of your CD tower.
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|Enough other posts have talked about how the Oprah version has special \\"Oprah highlighted text\\" -- certain passages underlined by Oprah herself, and no way to turn off that highlighting.<br /><br />I found this intrusive, and I didn't want her thoughts folded in as part of my reading experience.<br /><br />Note: Her highlights are not the not the same as standard Kindle highlighting.  Believe me, I tried! I turned off Popular Highlighting, and Oprah's highlights remained.<br /><br />Fortunately, I figured this out within 7 days of buying the book, so I was able to return it for a non-Oprah Kindle version.<br /><br />I returned this version:<br />[[ASIN:B005CRQ4XI Wild Journey Found Oprahs ebook]]<br /><br />And purchased this version:<br />[[ASIN:B005IQZB14 Found Pacific Crest Trail ebook]]<br /><br />At first I was concerned because both book covers showed the same \\"O,\\" and I thought they would both have Oprah's highlights.  However, despite the incorrect book cover being shown, the second URL I listed above does not contain Oprah highlights.<br /><br />I hope this information is helpful.
B00EEDNA4M|4.0|AMC's Breaking Bad is a terrific show, that has won an unprecedented number of awards, but it's one that is extremely difficult to get into. The show is centered on High School chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), who discovers he's dying from cancer. Determined not to leave his family with nothing, White teams up with his former student and local drug dealer, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) in an attempt to process and sell crystal meth. Producing the drug isn't the hard part, it's distributing it while staying out of trouble. That's easier said than done, especially when your wife is on your case 24/7, and your brother in-law is a DEA agent.    This show is terrific and worth every second I've spent watching it, but I almost missed out. The pilot episode was not a strong one, in fact, many fans of the show have called it the worst episode of the entire series. If you can make it passed that, the first season isn't much better. The first season is extremely dark and depressing, focusing mainly on Walt's illness and the effect it has on his family. It really wasn't easy to watch, especially if you've like me, and have had family go through the same thing.    The good news is that after the depressing 7 episode first season, the show gets much much better. The network or the producers had to have to seen the same thing that everyone saw and the attention of future episodes is centered around Walt and Jesse's growing business and the problems they have, including nosy family members, the DEA, seedy people looking for a taste, and of course rival dealers and gangs. The show really picks up in the second season and starts to evolve into the award winning crime drama it has become.    Bryan Cranston plays Walt and how good is he? He has won 3 Emmy's, and has been nominated every season the show has been on. The man he plays is so complicated that you really needed the very best actor you could find to play him. Walt White is a mess of emotions, concealed within astrong persona, it's this concealment that also helps to keep his conscience at bay, most of the time.    Jesse Pinkman is played by Aaron Paul who is also very good. Paul himself has been nominated for four Emmy's, winning twice, and will now and forever be required to call people bitch. Paul is a very good actor and does a great job playing a character who I find to be extremely annoying. Jesse is always managing to !@#$ thing up, he's always putting them at risk by saying stupid things and doing stupid things. To be honest with you, I don't care much for the character, but the fact that the character, as opposed to the actor, annoys me, shows how strong his performances is.    Walt's family is also a main stay in the show, his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), is as strong a housewife as I have ever seen. There is nothing Skyler White won't say and she is often Walt's morale compass, albeit one that is remarkably nosy and unappreciative. His son is played by newcomer R.J. Mitte whose  handicapped angle is actually real. Mitte was born with cerebral palsy, which effects his speech and movements. He admits that he over-dramatizes the effects for the show, but he is still handicapped in real life and one hell of an inspirational person. Through it all he has never let anyone tell him he can't do anything and he has been open and upfront about his condition to anyone who has asked him about it. He's really an inspiration kid, who took a handicapped and used it to his advantage.    Finally, Walt's brother-in-law, DEA Agent, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), brings much needed comic relief to a show that can be hard to watch sometimes. Besides being a great cop, Schrader has a personality that is larger than life. Even in the context of a show, where the cops are the bad guys, you find yourself drawn to Schrader and rooting him on.    Breaking Bad has won a total of 7 Emmy Awards and is one of the highest rated shows in cable history. The show most defiantly fits into the categoryof addictive television, but unlike it's neighboring show, The Walking Dead. The acting is as believable as it gets and the story just gets better and better every season. If you can make it through the slow and depressing first season, you will find an unbelievable show that may very well be one of the best that cable has ever seen.

B000VLE3GA|5.0|Album is jam packed with the songs any fan will want and I got it all for 10 bucks!! Adding to the songs I already liked I feel that I have a greater understanding as to why many people find Led Zeppelin to be the greatest rock band of all time!
B00B935SUY|4.0|Good show if you lived in the time when all that great music was created and first played on the airwaves. With more info about many of my old fav's ......I  was glued and I'll likely watch it again.  Thank God Dave stepped up to rehouse , and let the Neve live on!!!
B00957T6X6|5.0|A great book that continues the legacy from the first of the series, \\"A Game of Thrones.\\"<br />GEORGE R.R. Martin continues his brilliant work f I loved with just interesting characters twists and turns and some fan service here and t here to keep you going.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|this show covers all the bases (pun intended) - drama, music, story-in-a-story, icons and talent galore... will watch it over and over again!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best game for kindle fire in the whole app store.....it's easy to play, use, and it is very portable. It does not require internet, or an account on a weird website.  It is one of the best....try it it's free.  Look up on how many points, scores, and characters online and compare yours to others
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|recommend it to no one, have to but more points and it stops  and takes awhile to return. don't like it
B008XKSW7M|2.0|What I expected from this movie was a bit more laughs, a bit more creativity, a bit more...something. Instead...meh. It passed the time, but I wouldn't  recommend it or want to see it again.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Great little blues movie. Karate kid did a great good job acting. The old harp player stole the show though.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It is a story about friendship and how a good friendship can make a change in person. It is also a story about those healing forces only nature has. I loved those detailed descriptions of nature waking up in the spring, birds starting their nesting, scents of the moor and forests. There is a good, peaceful mood in this book, nothing bad happens, you can just forget the outer world and enjoy the spring with these kids.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We hadn't heard about this show before it showed up in the recommended list so we gave it a try. We are only watching one show at any given time and right now its Suits. It makes me wish the show was older so there would be more seasons lined up. When we finish with season 2 we will be waiting until 3 makes it to Prime before we can see it.
055358894X|4.0|The Lies of Locke Lamora straddles the line between more usual Epic Fantasy (especially of the modern grimdark variety) and Sword and Sorcery in the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser/Trickster tradition.  Introducing Locke Lamora as a child, the narrative progresses from there to show his entr&eacute;e into the world of thievery, eventually joining an Exactly What It Says on the Tin gang of con men named the Gentlemen Bastards (hence the series name).  The narrative splits between the adventures of the adult Lamora and a slow reveal of his backstory.<br /><br />You would think the general shenanigans of the Gentlemen Bastards would ensue, but Lynch has grander designs.  Lamora quickly finds himself treading much deeper, shark-infested waters.  Lynch also confounds expectations by making the stakes high on a societal as well as personal level, giving us a character none too slow to resort to violence, providing a high body count (it's not a \\"caper\\" because it's entirely too bloody), creating a rich second-world (if a swashbuckling, city-state filled one primed for Sword and Sorcery), and an extra-long page count.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a complimentary copy of The Lies of Locke Lamora through Goodreads First Reads.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Rocky - the monkey with the fun of building your character and inter changing him/her into some zany/wild characters. Lots of fun
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect with this movie. But oh my gosh, I really loved it. It had perfect twists, & great interactions between the characters...just great. Love Benedict Cumberbatch :) Everytime I thought it was over something ELSE happened!
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|Everything the Eagles do is worth owning and listening to.  However, this 2 disk CD is not my favorite.  There are about 6 songs that are terrific but the others haven't hooked me yet.
B007Z8ZKS2|3.0|Well written and constructed. Two cancer-crossed lovers try to make sense of the short time allotted to them. Full of emotion and pathos with a dash of gallows humour. Closely sticks to the conventions of the genre.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Stories to be savored and re-read.  The attention to the details of human interaction and emotion is fantastic.  Understated, elegant, intelligent.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This was a very well done documentary that reminds you how great &#34;good music&#34; is and how much we should support that artists that are making it.
B0042816YK|5.0|Excellent movie! Perfect for the ladies to watch alone. Hopefully some women will learn something from it. Would recommend to anyone.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed this game quite a bit, the story was interesting and the graphics were very good. Only reason I don't give it five stars is because it was fairly short in my opinion, especially considering it was $4.99.
B00CO8TA4I|5.0|I installed this with a custom HSF, and even OC'd to 4GHz I've yet to see it go over 70C. Very good budget CPU.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Fun to play for all ages.  Compete against the Grand-kids and stand a good chance of winning.  They love the blow-ups.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Hello people don't waste your coins on games that say ad free you don't need to because here's a secret if you want your game to be ad free just set your mobile device kindle tablet phone whatever just set it to airplane mode trust me well that's all because I heard some of you saying that it has porn in it so you deleted it or bought the ad free one well hope it helps cause I use it all the time
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I don't feel a rehash or summary of the City of Bones is necessary considering the very detailed ones that are already provided by other reviewers, so let's just jump right in.<br /><br />I bought this book because of all the good things I've heard. I've recieved good reviews from friends that have devoured this series. And then there's the movie thats out in theatres. The City of Bones comes with glittering reviews from loyal fans, and I figured that this must be a really good book to try after reading most of the big-name novels in the YA section (i.e. Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Divergent, Matched, Enclave, and even Twilight etc.). It gets to a certain point that the book must reach some pretty high expectations, what with all the hupe surrounding it.<br /><br />And this book just didn't wow me.<br /><br />Considering all of the paranormal books floating around in YA now, I can understand how certain elements may be reused in diferent series, and I am totally ok with that, because they work. I mean, how many books have we read that have a kick butt heroine, or dark and mysterious love interest, or &#34;the-fate-of-the-world-rests-in-their-hands&#34; kind of subplot? We see that all the time because it has worked before, and it is bound to work again in terms of sales. But when I read the City of Bones, I felt that I had a serious sense of déjà vu.<br />Clary is predictable in terms of a character. She's thrown into this world that she has become a part of, determined to save her mom. She gets scared and is ignorant of the forces that be. And that's forgivable, considering her circumstances. But after a while, it just gets annoying. She becomes this little sidekick while all the big kids do all the work. I mean, her mortal friend Simon did a better job when push came to shove once the real action started (if you've read the books, you can see where I'm coming from.) There are these Star Wars cliché moments: think Luke and Leia and the famous &#34;I AM YOUR FATHER&#34; moment. And not to mention there are the muggles. Wait, I meant to say &#34;mundanes&#34; there ;)<br />And then her Ms. Clare's writing style. Technically, there's nothing wrong with her style but I find it a bit repetitive. She also tends to use these similes and metaphors that are very fluid in the middle of an action shot. I found myself skipping over chunks of the text because it bored me to read about how Jace's golden eyes appeared amber in the moonlight in the midst of a vampire attack and blah blah blah. I will admit that she does a fantastic job at world building, but some of these ideas have been used before. The terminology can be confusing when reading, but it can be overlooked.<br />Overall, I think that Cassandra has set up a great slate for a series, now that all the bones are in place. Hopefully, some  of the &#34;info dump&#34; moments will be less frequent in the future, now that the world is explained enough that the reader can relate. Aside from some moments that I've seen before, I feel that this was a good book (note: good, not great). In my mind, this book isn't worthy of a five star review, but I am curious to see if the movie adaptation is any better than the novel itself.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of my favorite books. I even got my GF, who doesn't care much for si-fi, to fall for it. Thanx for a great book
B003NS2T9G|4.0|Initial interest was in it's tie in to Dr. Who. Nicely done, entertaining and fun to watch. Can't say I loved it but it was entertaining.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Other thenn not being able to get to my friends and being able to buy a new nest I love it.
B00BLDD3A4|5.0|Bought this after watching the film on VH1. So many great artists here, it just has to be good. However, the irony of buying a digital copy of an album from a movie that stressed how great it was to record in Analog is not lost on me.
B004QBWU02|5.0|I'VE WATCHED THIS MOVIE HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND NEVER GET TIRED OF THE MUSIC THE CARS AND THE WACKY CHARACTERS
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Generally, I like the comic book genre of movies. For some reason, I wasn't really that into Thor, but decided I better watch it before seeing the Avengers. I wasn't disappointed. Enough action and story here to entertain.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE! MY GRANDCHILDREN HAVE THIS MOVIE AND I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH THAT I ORDERED FROM AMAZON FOR MY OWN ENJOYMENT!
B000NY17J6|5.0|Great music all the way through.  What a talent!  I should have added this to my music collection many years ago.
B004O7EVLY|5.0|From the pits if Sweden, graveyard emerged from a place inside blues,rock,and folk at the same time. The band has such a blend of talent they can't keep hidden for to much longer. Just one of life's simple musical masterpiece thank you
B0027MJU00|5.0|I liked this just as much as Gone Girl. This book had a lot of secrets to reveal, you keep reading and just know something is about to happen.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Despite being a life-long Star Trek fan, I was deployed for most of the time this series was in prime time and missed the majority of it.  I'm now able to watch it on-line with my Amazon Prime account, and enjoy it.  The show sticks to canon as much as possible, and provides a good back-story to much of what is in the Original Series, Next Generation, and beyond.  It provides a good sense of mankind exploring the stars on their own for the first time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|clearly an idiot. I mean, come on. It's an awesome show. Awesome enough to pry the money out of my hands to watch it.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Characters are very  interesting and seems true to the period. Good glimpse into England in the early 1900s. I recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen house was excellent! I could not put it down! May have been fiction but certainly contained details that could be true! I would recommend it to anyone!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am having so much fun with this game, the game is easy yet challenging. I play every day.  Can't get enough.
1781162646|4.0|I'm not into a bunch of blood, guts, and gore, but I love Steven King's books.  Whenever I read something of his, I know the characters.  He has quite an art of description and staying true to that character, that makes me feel that I would recognize these peolpe if I was to ever cross paths with them.  I actually got a little depressed after the Gunslinger series because I wouldn't be able to see Roland anymore.  That's a good writer.  Joyland does not dissapoint.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love the Hunger Games series, I thought this book was totally awesome, and I really think Suzanne Collins should make a spinoff series with Prim going into the hunger games or something!
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|Or I should say, lots of crawling in circles.  I've been a fan of many of the Big Fish games, but this game is very slow.  As you move from one location to the next, picking up bits of clues here and there, it takes forever to put together enough parts to come up with some solid direction. Unlike other games, that take you to a location that provides an interesting &quot;game within a game&quot;, this takes you to a location, where you learn a tiny piece of a clue, then hit the back button over and over to try to find why it's important, where it fits, and where the rest of the clue is.  There's a free version of this game, but I purchased mine.  I'd check out some of the other games before spending money on this one.  Just so so.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I enjoyed Mumford & Sons other stuff.  This album is no different.  In fact, it sounds like they took their previous music and perfected it.  Nothing has changed, no new avenues for this band.  They took a good thing and made it better.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|When in question about the weather I have it in hand with my Kindle download of the Weather channel.  Whoever made that possible did a good thing and I thank you
B0052SF6CM|4.0|Calvin Harris has some great tracks that span the spectrum of electronic music.  Techno, house, dance, even a little dubstep influence is evident.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Very good music, the boys are the best. I hope more music is coming. no more to say Wow Wow
B000HD1AEA|5.0|A beautiful, deeply moving concert by Sarah.  Excellent mix of songs--all sung from the heart.  One of the truly great musicians of our time and a beautiful person whom we can all greatly admire.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Great album and I especially love how I was able to download my purchased album thru amazon and put it on my iPod
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan has collected and edited the primary sources concerning Jesus and done an admirable job of demystifying a person who is almost invisible under the centuries of partisan re-branding. Jesus was a Jew, in a time of deadly unrest in Israel. There were dozens of other Messiahs, all of whom left much more in the way of historical documentation than Jesus. Most interesting to me was the struggle between James, the brother of Jesus, and Paul of the direction the not yet founded church would take. Sadly for the world, James was killed, and Paul's heresy became dogma.
B00A83PFW2|5.0|They are creepy-cool fun.  Lots of imagination has been used with these dolls.  My granddaughter has definitely played many hours with her monster high dolls.  Would recommend.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|...for david sedaris fans and fans to be. for anyone following the chronicles of sedaris' life, &#34;engulfed&#34; continues the saga, fills in some gaps, and keeps us entertained with comic and poignant details of everyday, ordinary life and shows once again, that no life is ordinary to the people who live it.
B00957T6X6|2.0|Frankly I'm only half way through the second volume. Each volume is about 800 plus pages; each chapter has about 300 different people to keep track of; Though the story is interesting; I was getting tired of the description of each character's clothing to the most minute detail and I kept forgetting who was a good guy and who was a bad guy, etc. etc.  I'm sure there are those out there that think this is great; Not for me -- I might finish it, but right now not so interested.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|SOA is the BEST!!!  Total addict.  I have watched all 4 seasons twice!  Waiting for the next season with nervious anticipation...
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Great flic. Loved it. Matthe w McConagh ey is excellent in this film. But those kids steal the show in my opinion. Reese Witherspoon is good too.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|One of the best seasons of Dr.  Who. I like the Pond's as companions and River Song is the bomb!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I loved the back and forth from present to past. The story continues to build and surprise right to the very end. I loved it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this game thinking it was going to be so much fun and guess what it was. So anybody out there who gets on their kindle or other device to pass the time this is the best game ever. You take care of your horse you train it enter it in competitions that are super easy. Such a fun game I highly recommend it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I've been searching for a book to fill the void left by the end of my beloved Harry Potter series and to read while I wait for George R.R. Martin to pull his head from his arse and write another Game of Thrones. I loved this book! It was whimsical and entertaining. I even enjoyed reading the acknowledgements at the end.
B007AL48UK|4.0|Seasonal changes provide some interest and ratings urge you to go faster and faster. However, I still prefer Mahjong Artifacts.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great it has tons of action and to me and my bro it's challenging so  we like!For example when a train comes at u, u have to move from track to track to track without getting hit! So this is a rating of 5 stars for me!
B00E193Y36|5.0|This Album is bye far highly anticipated! And from what they put down in 29 tracks, It will blow you away!!!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|The book was very boring and I just couldn't keep going.  I always give a book at least 100 pages–this one just didn't do it for me.
0545123275|4.0|Some of the subject matter was a little mature for very young teens but it is handled very tastefully.  It has a good story line and engaging characters.  We will certainly be buying the rest of the series.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|IMO a Horrible remake! This movie didn't do the originals justice and so it joins the ranks of all the remakes out there. I can't even understand why bruce campbell had anything to do with it. The originals had a lot more likeable dark humor than this one. Very much like &#34;drag me to hell&#34;, which had the same director. But if you like the reinterpreted genres where a director has a different take on the plot, then you probably will enjoy it. In any event it was too short...the plot rushed too fast, and the elements were too standard and cliched.
B0058DRSHW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - very helpful to read in the business world -I would suggest reading good to great first
0689815816|5.0|I have worked as a substitute para in our district's preschools, and saw this story used in several of the preK classes. It was a favorite. When I was looking for good board books to have at Grandma's for our two grandsons, I came across &#34;&#34;Bear Hunt. What I love about it is that it teaches prepositions (over, under, and through), words for sounds (onomatopoeia), and helps develop memory skills. My almost 3 year old grandson can &#34;read&#34; (memory and picture clues) the book after I read it to him, and basically knows what's on each page as he turns them. There's so much you can do with this book! And it's FUN!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Always twists and turns of the unexpected. Keeps you watching. I like that the writers continue to use Snow White's desire to see the good in everyone and give Regina chance after chance to redeem herself, even though she has done horrible stuff. This is how Christians are supposed to be with those who hurt us. It's a hard thing to do, but Jesus says we must do it anyway. I'm still working on this one.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Great overview of the integral role food plays in our nations health and how to correct ailments presented by patients with food-based protocols.
B004FDPOHC|5.0|I'm actually a fan of the movie, but I don't think it would have had half the impact that it did if it wasn't for the pulsing Daft Punk soundtrack.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|Hands down one of my favorite movies this movie is definitely a classic.The last movie in the fistful of dollars trilogy follwing the man with no name.Spaghetti Wstern at its finest
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love this game.  Works great on my kindle fire 2 nd generation. Makes you think, trying to figure out where candy needs to go first.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This movie was visually stunning, the effects were beyond what I've ever really seen (Apart from maybe Avatar), and the fighting was amazing. It never felt as though it was boring but I'll keep it short.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Stunning Visuals<br />-Cute but not overdone romance<br />-Badass fight scenes<br />-Heart pumping thriller!<br /><br />Cons<br />-Extremely predictable (even though I enjoyed it)<br />-Dozens of references to other movies
0321934318|5.0|Another outstanding photography how-to book from Scott Kelby. It explains how to use the newest Lightroom features introduced in Lightroom 5
B002HLM4E0|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who ever read the Harry Potter series, especially if you grew up with the series.
0761129235|4.0|It is a nice book, just what I expected. There are many good ideas in it. I would recommend it.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I can't believe how timely this subject matter is. I gave it 4 stars because I am not finished reading it. Hope this one makes it to the big screen.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Much better than temple run 1! it has curves that are more interesting than right anles all the time. its fun interesting and addictive.
B00DU73T08|3.0|Read the book and it is one of those times that the book was so much better that the movie was not that great. Probably would have been better if I had not read the book
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A Fox News interviewer tried to question Aslan's qualifications to write a book about Jesus because he is a Muslim. It is obvious that she never read the book. We have very little evidence of the historical Jesus. There are only the gospels and some of the letters of Paul, all of which were writen decades or more after Jesus's death, and some writings by Josephus at the end of the first century. Aslan reconstructs the times of the Roman occupation of Palestine, what could and could not have happened. He describes the social chaos and brutal responses of the Romans and the conflicts between messianic Jews and their smug countrymen who were thriving under Romans. He tells of the other &#34;messiahs&#34; that we never hear about who also died at the hands of the Romans.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written. I usually read in bed at night, and I could never put it down until I fell asleep. The following night I had to find the place where I left off. Fortunately, my Kindle makes that easy.<br /><br />Reza Aslan is a brilliant historian and a Biblical scholar. He cites other scholars when they agree with him, but also when they do not. There is nothing in the book that could not have been written by an open minded Christian scholar. Bravo!
B000002KBU|5.0|great from start to finish. The latest reissue is bright and loud. I'm okay with it. most highly recommended. bye !
B001JQM7TG|4.0|This is a book that you have to read a little bit everyday and think about it. Very interesting concepts.
B0063GORYU|5.0|What can you say about this classic game. It is GREAT. I love it on my PC, phone and now tablet.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen a while the 2nd one in the star trek set and I am hooked this movie was amazing
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Deleted it.  Did not like the style/colors of the tiles and game.  Maybe I'm too used to the &#34;plan ole&#34; PC version.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|lots of fun. quick turns changes in the beginning.  like the point purchases.  thank you for an entertaining and challenging game.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Ok game. It was not what I expected.  After I blew through many of the levels quickly, I deleted it.
B006QVRVJK|1.0|Quickly descends into drivel.  Too bad Polanski wasted his talent on such boring nonsense.  The acting is over the top.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Just what I wanted. Allows me to be able to make a quick and easy to find note or reminder.  Perfect!!!!!!
B003K16P3M|4.0|This is just the kind of YA novel I adore. exciting adventure but not too serious. light romance but not a tortured love triangle. Over all it's a fun wonderful introduction to a world that just gets better culminating in Bitterblue (which was amazing).
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is one of the most powerful books I have read I can't put it down I have read this book several times. I hope for the best for all the SEALS still out there. I spent 4 years in the Marines and can only dream that i could have ever shown the courage and strength that each of these men did.
B002IXA5KW|1.0|I saw this movie back in 2009, and loved it. My husband & I decided to re-watch it tonight. I kept feeling like something was missing throughout the movie. I could have sworn there was a rape scene... stuff like that. After the movie, my husband said \\"I feel like there might have been parts cut out... I seem to recall ______ and ______\\" and yeah! Me too!<br /><br />I don't actually have a desire to watch a rape scene AT ALL, but I have even a less desire to watch a movie THAT CUTS OUT PARTS WITHOUT TELLING ME FIRST!<br /><br />I'm furious. I generally rent all my movies from Amazon, and now I'll never trust that I'm watching the original movie again. This sucks.<br /><br />I mean... if you're going to cut out bits of a movie... SAY SO!<br /><br />This is for the Instant Download version. I have no idea if it's like this in the DVD/Blu-Ray versions too.<br /><br />For the record, I loved the actual movie. The 1 star is for Amazon's downloaded version. I actually contacted them and got a refund for the movie. Really bummed about it, though, as now I can never trust Amazon Instant Downloads again. Who knows if you're getting the correct un-edited version.
B0093X805W|5.0|Really I like charlie, its so enjoyable for all ages. Recommended for young readers. Moral, illustrations, character depiction are so perfect.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|As always with Leonard Cohen, great music.  Timeless and easy to listen to.  I enjoy all of his music and so does my granddaughter.

B000F1IQN2|5.0|This movie is so good, because Eric Bana is so good playing a Jew in it.  Great cinematography, action scenes, and attention to time period set details.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a great show with witty dialouge and interesting characters. I would recommend this show to anybody who likes White Collar.
B008JFUN6E|2.0|Seriously, how old are the people writing these reviews?<br /><br />Why this movie wins:<br />1. Great graphics.<br />2. It's dystopic.<br /><br />Why this movie flops:<br />1. Failure of a plot.<br />2. Failure to make us care about the characters - any of them.<br />3. Shaky, fast cutting, A.D.D. riddled camera work. Just.. why??<br /><br />Over-hype = successfully tricking people to buy a ticket.<br /><br />Hollywood wonders why it's losing money. It's because THEIR FILMS CONTINUE TO STINK!
B003G4W49C|2.0|I realize this is a children's book and was not expecting great literature, but given the book's fame and awards, I certainly was expecting much more in terms of quality.  After all, the Harry Potter series and The Hobbit are also children's stories, both brilliantly told.  Ender's Game has a solid plot--a futuristic society where children are trained, starting from an early age and only after significant evaluation, to become military leaders, in preparation for a coming war against insectoid aliens who nearly annihilated humankind previously; however, the writing is not so solid.  There is little character development and  subplots aren't fully realized; the full angst and torment Ender is supposed to be going through in the grueling training is not convincingly told and thus there's little empathy for the main character; there's a development at the end which, far from being a plot-line resolution, just leaves you a bit baffled.  I'm not sure how old Orson Scott Card was when he wrote this book, as that might explain some of these deficiencies; Ender's Game may not only be a children's book....it seems to have been written by a child.
1401938906|5.0|Pam Grout's style is enjoyable and informative.  She explores an otherwise dry topic with warmth, humor and intelligence.

B004GJDQT8|3.0|This app falls victim to the quality of Amazon's mobile web site. If you have a relatively large screen on your phone, I think the normal web site works better: showing more detail and extra options while remaining easily readable. On the other hand, this app lets you do everything you'd probably want to do on the normal site while possibly saving some bandwidth.

B00D7JGL36|4.0|Tribute albums are a tricky proposition. Play it too close and you add nothing of your own; take too many liberties and you lose touch with the object of your affection. Finding a middle ground that honors the original performances, adds something new and echoes both the celebrated and celebrant is one of the most delicate balancing acts in music. To best accomplish this, you need to have absorbed an artist's music into your roots, so that your own path of discovery carries the DNA of these influences even as you develop your unique variations. Recorded country music has a long history of meaningful tips of a ten gallon hat, and such is the case for this heartfelt tribute to Buck Owens and Merle Haggard from singer-guitarist Vince Gill and steel guitarist Paul Franklin.<br /><br />Both Gill and Franklin took to the Bakersfield sound and the songs of Owens and Haggard at very young ages, spurred to dig deeper into music by the revolutionary sounds coming out of Bakersfield in the 1960s. Between Gill and Franklin, they're able to cover three of the key elements of Owens' and Haggard's records: vocals, guitar and steel. Gill's always had one of the sweetest voices in contemporary country music, but it's still surprising how easily and equally it lends itself to both singers' music. He sings his own harmony on the Owens' tunes, just as Owens had done on his own studio recordings, and adds telecaster sting, including the chicken pickin' and stuttering leads that bring to mind James Burton and Roy Nichols.<br /><br />Franklin's steel provides Gill the perfect partner, adding the twangy instrumental voice that gave Owens' and Haggard's music its unapologetic country sound. He pays tribute to Tom Brumley and Ralph Mooney, as does pretty much every player who touches a steel guitar, but with his own twists to signature solos such as Brumley's masterpiece on \\"Together Again.\\" The song list combines several of Owens' and Haggard's most familiar hits - \\"Foolin' 'Round,\\" \\"Branded Man,\\" \\"Together Again,\\" \\"The Bottle Let Me Down\\" and \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\" - with well selected catalog gems. The latter are highlighted by Owens' 1966 two-stepping album side \\"He Don't Deserve You Anymore\\" and Haggard's pained 1974 \\"Holding Things Together.\\"<br /><br />Gill has recorded many great records, both as a chart-topping hit maker in the '90s and as an album auteur in the last decade. Franklin's been one of Nashville's most prolific session players, spreading his commercial and artistic successes across hundreds of records. But playing the material that fueled their imaginations as youngsters clearly lights a spark in each of them. Their balance between fidelity and liberty is just right, with the heart of each song filigreed with changes that are often small, but meaningful. Gill and Franklin each bring their own style to the record, but they are styles which grew partly in Bakersfield soil. The album's only disappointment is the short ten track song list; a number that's particularly small when drawing from the lengthy catalogs of two country music giants. 4-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie.  I bought various versions of the film in VHS as they were released, and the original 5-disk set when it came out on DVD.  Now, at a great price, I have the 5-disk Blu-ray set and am delighted with the improved definition.

B00CKOQC9C|5.0|All of us have enjoyed the writing prowess of Ray Bradbury throughout his writing career. His style, while varied, has given us the rich boyhood tales from 'Dandelion Wine' to his myriad of insightful and haunting short stories to his eerily descriptive \\"Something Wicked....\\". \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" fits perfectly into the imaginative sequence of stories written by this poetic master.<br /><br />In a unique manner of offering us a series of short tales and essays written about inhabitants of Mars and covering a progressive number of decades, we are given an overall view of man's inhumanity to anyone but himself and, because of these actions, we are led to the eventual nuclear destruction of our home planet, Earth. While Earth, itself, is what it is, the proving ground for man's insanity, Mars is presented as symbolic prose. Does it represent man's retreat or escape from reality? Is it merely a dream-like repression from our own aggressions? Or does it offer us a means for hope and the striving for an existence other than the one we find ourselves living through? The answer to this puzzling question could not be answered by the author anymore than it can be by his most ardent readers..............

B000G6R7B8|5.0|I needed a watch for the summer, one that did not make my wrist sweat so much.  This watch works perfectly and the fact that it is an automatic I don't have to worry about replacing batteries.  I think it was a good purchase.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|The mid 70s Crimson era is my fav and this album is the best of that group. While not as eccentric as its two predecessors, it's more focused, intense and I think has aged better. To me, Red is to King Crimson what Revolver is to the Beatles ... the great album that isn't always as recognized as others in the catalog.<br /><br />To my taste, this has the best lyrics and the best singing of any Crimson album. Wetton brings real authority to the vocal parts, which can sometimes seem like an afterthought in the world of Crimson.<br /><br /> All the players are in top form. Everything feels absolutely assured and unlike a good bit of other 70s \\"prog rock,\\" absolutely purposeful.<br /><br />The other later Crimson works that strike me the same way as Red are the instrumental tracks from the album Thrak.<br /><br />And if you have 10 minutes or so, the final track. Wow.<br /><br />Essential.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|iTS A FUN TIME WASTING GAME....BUT IT DOES GET TO THE POINT TO WHERE IT'S LIKE YOU'RE JUST DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Ok. I saw this movie as an Advanced screening and met some of the cast about two weeks before it opened, amazing...and then when it did open, I went to the theater and paid to see it...twice. Need I say more?
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This movie is funny seeing the Governator playing in this one especaily riding in a smart car really funny. If you like action and humor this is the movie for you.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I truly cannot stand Tom Cruise, because he is a major ass in real life, but this was a great movie anyway.  Morgan Freeman is great as always, and Olga Kurylenko delivers a great performance too.  Probably gonna buy it and add it to my SciFi collection!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Good book although it pisses me off when my favorite characters are whittled away one by one throughout the series. Danearys is bad ass!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I know Heathcliff is a brute and a bitter one too but I love how passionate he is toward Catherine, his obsession and possessive nature is two of the best elements of romance novels.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I choose this rating because it is a great and easy app to use also very helpful. Quick and easy to use and don't have to hit any buttons.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is 100 percent awesome!!!! You should totally download it now!!!! It's so worth the price!! Every once in a while there's a small glitch, but other than that it's perfect!! You can choose from creative or survival mode, and have like a million different world files. On creative you can fly and you have infinite resources and on survival you have to mine your own resources and craft stuff, and at night monsters come out. I love how you can craft armor, too!! My only complaint is that all my friends talk about minecraft, and they always mention endermen and enderdragons. This game doesn't have them, and I wish it did. I suggest they add them in the next update. Speaking of updates, they are all awesome!! The game updates for free, and all of them are awesome!! I know I said that already, but it's true!! DOANLOAD IT NOW!!!!!!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!!

B0082Z447U|2.0|There is really no suspense in this book, since if you are paying attention you know the answer to the big conundrum the first time they mention it. It is waaaaaay too long. A good editor could take out two thirds of this novel and you would miss nothing.<br /><br />Download this only if you like to read a lot, and accomplish nothing.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Fantastic movie. Tom Cruize and Dustin Hoffman both did outstanding work in this movie!!<br />One of my all time favorite movies!!

B001AZFO14|5.0|Kurt Russell kicking ass. He does such a good job at not cracking a smile thru the whole movie. A great good versus bad story line. Its worth the rental fee. Oh, I forgot it was free with my Prime membership. How cool is that?

B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I have always loved listening to Five Finger Death Punch, so it was no surprise to me that this album IS SO AWESOME! And of course, Amazon wasted NO TIME in getting my purchase to me. Keep up the great work Amazon and Five Finger Death Punch!  I would definitely recommend this to all of my fellow listeners of metal music.
B009GEAPYW|3.0|As the rating states, its okay, its not as bad as the live action movies, which I am sure just pissed a lot of people off, and if it didn't read on.<br /><br />I have the original 4 graphic novels that goes into making the Dark Knight Returns, in addition to at last count 6 complete graphic novels ( People got them for me for xmas b-day )<br /><br />I think it followed the story very well, there were some parts outta sequence with the comic, but eh..it was too bad.<br />One of the things that DROVE me absolutely crazy about both of these is the lack of the inner thought of the characters and the narration. I feel like there is a whole story missing.<br />One of the most touching parts and made me cry as a kid is when Alfred dies. 'A jolt travels the length of Alfred's SPINE. Of course, he thinks, as his head goes light' &#34;How utterly proper&#34;<br />While some of the thought bubbles were put in here and there through conversation, like when Clark and Bruce are talking and Clark explains where the others went, were as in the comic it was when he was fighting. I still feel like a lot of the story was missing because of this.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me is when Gordon was looking for his gum, which resembled the nicorette gum, he was really looking for his cigars.<br /><br />All in all its a decent watch. I have long since stopped comparing the movies to the comic, however with this I really felt they really tired to mirror the comic. For the most part they did, just a few minor things here and there, but the lack of the story with in the thought and narration is what really erked me.

You do not have to buy coins or acorns to play this game. You have a lot of opportunity to win them or collect them. You can arrange everybody the way you like it, and you can change it any time you want to. It is very addicting. Once you start, you can't stop. It is awesome!

B003E88TKS|5.0|Up In The Air introduces you to some excellent characters that drive this narrative from start to finish. Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a guy with practically no home, no center. He lives to travel, travels to live as he bounces from one city to another as part of his job, which is zany in itself. Bingham works for an outside contractor hired by firms conducting lay-offs. So he gets to fire everyone, which is no easy job. He meets Alex, a funky lady who is a free spirit, or so it seems. They strike up a relationship that seems perfect for both of them. Enter Natalie, an upstart technology expert who thinks Bingham's job can be done via web-chat, thus eliminating the need for Bingham to travel and thereby threatening his entire existence. Of course Bingham is the old hand and Natalie has a lot to learn. Along the way Alex pops in and out, causing Bingham to ultimately question what he's all about. Alex has a bombshell of her own, one that leaves Bingham reeling. This movie is seamless as it weaves the multi-layered drama between Bingham's job and his personal life on the road. However, please note, there are no winners and no losers in this flick, with perhaps (PERHAPS) one exception: Natalie, who finds a way out. It's almost a film noir project (but with no crime and everyone lives). Performances are outstanding, especially the dynamic between Bingham, Alex, and Natalie. When these three are together, it's impossible to look away. The ending will put a lump in your throat and make you think. And that's the way I like my movies.

B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Parts of this were pretty slow moving but overall it was very entertaining. I would recommend it. I loved the Sci-Fi world they created and the special effects were really good.

Just watch it and I am sure you'll have a good time!

B00D6QUMWG|5.0|Anna Netrebko is well established a physically stunning actress singer in both the US and Europe. She seems to go form success to success with a voice that seems to be still growing with a warmth and depth of emotional conviction for the roles she assumes.  Never exactly known for her Verdi roles she now tackles these with aplomb and especially after her very recent triumph with Placido Domingo in Giovanna d'Arco in Salzburg she seems to have conquered once again.<br /><br />To the fact that this new album, already a #1 success in Europe, the beautiful Netrebko has responded, \\"I couldn't be happier that Verdi's music is reaching such a wide audience, especially with this year being his bicentennial.\\" Various critics are remarking about this album, `The voice is blooming, she puts amazing energy in the dramatic effects, always respecting the vocal outlines\\" (Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung),  \\"Netrebko's control over her voice is breathtaking . . . Her voice is so flexible that everything seems to be totally effortless for her.\\" (Die Presse), and `. . . a newly darkened, larger-sounding voice . . . In the amazing sleepwalking scene, Lady Macbeth is between two worlds -- the deranged mists of the subconscious and the misguided logic of her reality. Verdi felt it should be sung in an ugly voice, a task foreign to Netrebko. Still, pouring out a gorgeous, aubergine tone, she imbues the character with an ethereal mix of strength and vulnerability . . . it's more than enough to make opera fanatics curious over the prospects of seeing Netrebko inhabit the role for the first time on stage . . . there is an instrument of great beauty and an actress who can command a stage . . . She'll take some of the roles on this album to the opera stage soon. That's where her mark might truly be made in this challenging, dramatically intricate music. For now, with Verdi, we have a fascinating opening act.

B007TNS6JI|3.0|Good looking graphics with game play that is simply yet enjoyable. I like how you can actually buy items with coins when most games like this that feature in-game purchases generally make most items exclusive to their in-game credits, which you have to use real money to buy. However, I do not like the rapid level up the bosses seem to have.<br /><br />I was 3 missions into it, only level 4 I believe, and I enjoyed up facing a level 8 boss that nearly destroyed me. I would have died if I hadn't used 2 health potions. It's not too bad but unless you grind out on the same levels over and over again, You will have problems as you progress through the game. I think they should have toned down the difficulty a little bit on this one, Make it so you at least have a chance to beat each level without having to waste all your money on potions.<br /><br />Overall, Not a bad game. Wouldn't highly recommend it but if you like fighting dungeon games then I'd say give it a chance.
B004SBX112|5.0|Tough to play with the special features but fun. It's really hard when you try to get three stars for every section.
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|Solid graphics with basic game play. I agree with one review where it says that you can not advance without gems unless you are willing to put hours upon hours of the same repetitive tasks. I like the idea of the mini games and all that, It certainly adds interest to the game, but it's the stuff that you do outside of the mini games that ruins it for me. Everything is just too cluttered and it requires far too much time and effort then I would willingly put into it. It's takes away all the fun of the game.

B006S086AM|4.0|We were pleasantly surprised by this movie.  As my husband and I are in our mid thirties, the eighties setting appealed to us so we gave it a try.  We had not heard anything about this prior to viewing, so our expectations were not high, but we thought it was a really great movie, not AFI 100 great, just solid.  A lot more depth than most romcoms, the only downside was reallyKristen Stewart's less than stellar acting,  everyone else in the cast is excellent.  Lots of funny moments, especially wiT Kristin wig and bill hader. You won't regret watching!
B002DW92SE|3.0|It's an above average book overall. It'll probably turn into a movie soon - once they agree on the musical score. (It's a book about rock music - in particular a once-successful 1980s musician now secluded in rural Pennsylvania.) The other setting is just as depressing: a god forsaken place in England called Gooleness inhabited by inhibited, sad bores.
0812550706|4.0|I really liked this book, if you're into sci-fi you'll definitely like this. I think it is about good vs evil, human nature, and about war and why we as a people pursue it.

B0012OQZWA|3.0|I'll start with some disclosure: I've never been a particularly huge Origin fan, but I've enjoyed their sound when in the mood for some crazy fast technical death metal.<br /><br />Now, as for this release I have a two part review. After hearing Origin's latest release, Entity, I was impressed. Entity is their best work yet. So I decided to give Antithesis a try. After all, the sample clips sounded pretty good.<br /><br />Musically and lyrically, Antithesis is excellent. There is of course the nonstop use of blastbeats, sweeps and little spasms of tremolo-like solos through nearly the entire album that can sometimes leave you wondering if you're listening to a different song or not. Some people love it, some people hate it. In fact, Origin's overuse of these techniques is why I don't listen to them very often - it just gets monotonous. But on Antithesis I can hear a little more variation scattered throughout, as though they're at least trying to do something a little new here. One of the best songs on the album is \\"Wrath of Vishnu.\\" It's structured and balanced in a way that makes it stand out from the typical Origin monotonous sound without losing their trademark break-neck technical speed and insane blastbeats. My favorite song on the album is the final track, the self-titled \\"Antithesis.\\" I honestly believe this is the best song on the album because they finally show they're unafraid to mix in a tempo slower than hyper-speed. And the song finales with a great solo that's actually crafted as though written by a genuine talented guitarist, and not just a half second spontaneous solo spasm. But all-in-all, this album is really good from a purely musical and lyrical composition. So why only a 3 star rating? Keep reading ...<br /><br />This album, which had the potential to be an awesome release, is almost completely destroyed by one thing: the production. This has to be the absolute worst produced CD from a mainstream metal band on a big label - ever. The first problem you'll notice is the vocals. Where the hell are they? Oh! There they are! The vocals are so badly mixed and hidden behind everything else that it sounds like the band is playing in the studio, while the vocals were recorded somewhere off in the distance, in the woods through a Fisher Price mic and speaker. The vocals are so buried in the mix, that no amount of tweaking on the equalizer could fix it. At times you'll swear the CD is just an instrumental release. The other production blunder is the absence of any bass, either in Mike's playing or in the depth needed to bring out the thunder of the percussion. That's a shame too, because Mike Flores is phenomenal on bass. And John Longstreth's drumming is insanely good, but thanks to the pathetic production it sounds like little more than John going nuts on his snare with no depth to the bass kick or percussion at all. The guitar work, while technically great, also is extremely off tone - I'm not sure exactly how to explain it, but it does a huge disservice to the riffs and technical playing, so that you end up with overbearing shallow sounding snare massacre backed by guitar work that doesn't carry the umph of the riffing - all to deliver a very flat, sometimes squealy, horribly mixed sound.<br /><br />So that knocks some stars off. This album had a lot of potential, and is good from a technical and artistic perspective, but is nearly utterly ruined by the production. Whoever was in charge of mixing this album should be taken out to an alley and beaten with drumsticks the way John obliterates snares. No, but in all seriousness, the guys in Origin should demand a remixing of this album and re-release a properly produced edition - then it will earn an easy 4 or 5 stars.em you'll notice is the vocals.

B005LAJ22Q|3.0|Am I the only one noticing that the original Anchor Bay DVD edition of \\"The Walking Dead, Season 2\\" has terrible picture quality?? I've seen only a very few reviewers mention it but I can't just overlook it here. I have several dvd and blu-ray players and tried playing these dvd discs on all of them and the quality remains the same, pretty much one of the worst of any tv shows in recent history. There is digital distortion, out of focus shots, a plethora of unnecessary grain, contrast and sharpness issues throughout all the discs and episodes. I swear to God that a 1980's VHS movie doesn't look any worse than this garbage edition of an otherwise excellent show. I don't want to get into reviewing the storyline or the season itself, cause the quality of directing, acting and flow of story had been correctly reviewed here many times over. I just wanted to express my dissatisfaction of the dvd transfer's quality. Since there are so few negative reviews here regards to that, it almost makes me feel like I must have picked up a defective set. I doubt it but please do comment and tell me your experience with this issue..... :(

B002PEP4SC|4.0|Well, this book surely gave me a lesson in preconceived notions. I had avoided this series from the beginning, thinking it just an advertising ploy by ABC for the television series Castle. I mean, there was no actual, real author for this book. Then, a week ago, I spotted it in my local library's annual fundraiser, said \\"What the heck?\\" and purchased it for a pittance. And a well-spent pittance it turned out to be!<br /><br />The ghost author presented a well-balanced, logical, nuts-and-bolts kind of mystery with splashes of terror and romance intertwined. The dialogue between characters felt natural, sometimes serious, sometimes sarcastic, but always a good balance between professional interaction and personal snark. And, while the book is not written in a first person POV, the only insight provided into anyone's character is given to that of Nikki Heat. We learn virtually nothing personal about the inner workings of Jamison Rook or the detectives on her team.<br /><br />The story's arc led purposefully and deliberately toward the d&eacute;nouement without a lot of unnaturally placed red herrings.  In fact, a line spoken by Nikki Heat to Jamison Rook established the story's arc. The line, paraphrased, was: \\"We ask the questions and follow where the answers lead us.\\"  And follow those answers is where we went, chapter by chapter. It was only about 20 pages from the end when the reader was prevented from knowing everything that Heat knew and it became time to see if your suppositions matched her facts.<br /><br />I plan on reading more of the Castle series but a CAVEAT needs to be mentioned here: This book contains 196 pages printed in the smallest font with which I have ever seen a novel published!  An e-book for an e-reader with adjustable font settings is highly recommended.

This book is exceptional and stands apart from the others because Moriarty fleshes out not only the effect of secrets held and secrets revealed on everyone even remotely connected to the secret-keeper, but also how the weight of a long held secret can eat away at the secret-keeper. The emotions and reactions of each character after the book's various secrets are revealed felt genuine and real. Excellent!!
B007VYQ9G2|2.0|I like what I could watch of the movie but the whole flick skips so bad it was hard to enjoy!
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|After watching the trailer, and especially after seeing the MTV logo, I was prepared to chuckle through B movie mediocrity (albeit enlivened by Jeremy Renner). I was wrong; it's actually a decent movie and highly entertaining. The one-liners and obscenities sometimes seemed forced, as did the pastiche and reference, but in the end all was forgivable.<br />It was refreshing to see sibling protagonists, and both leads handled their characters/caricatures well. For my wife and I, the best part was the witches. I don't think I've ever seen a more compelling portrait of a classic, evil witch. The makeup, effects, and acting combined to create demonic, grotesquely demi-human creatures of nightmare and fairy tale, balancing menace, humor, and fight scene ferocity.<br />OK, it's not that profound. But it was fun.
B0031P4FFM|4.0|My daughter has turned into an ad vide reader, and this when she opened this package was so happy to have all the books together. She is like me, if you start a series, you must read them in order and together. So I was very happy with the price and the speed in which they arrived. We had them just in time for our family vacation that started with a 12 hour drive and ended with a 12 hour drive. They made the trip so much better.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|This is the first time I've played a game of this &#34;hidden object&#34; type. I was surprised by amount of fun I had obsessing over such a simple mechanism. The production values are good, the story has more depth than I expected, and its cliches are forgivable in light of the overall package. I haven't rushed to play another similar game, but I'm glad I played this one.
B0058EBNAO|1.0|I have no idea what its like because it didn't download to my Kindle. So I didn,t get what I paid for
B007Z8ZKS2|4.0|This book was charming,heart-breaking and perfect. An extraordinary book by an extraordinary author. Recommended to all being known to the universe.
B00DW36G32|2.0|Robert DeNiro is an excellent actor, but at 70, is too old to be playing an action figure. John Travolta is a reasonable choice for his part, but did you have to paint the top of his head black? The story revolves around DeNiro playing a retired Army vet; during the Bosnian War, he shot a Serbian soldier (Travolta)in the back of the head. Travolta makes a miraculous recovery and 18 years later, comes seeking revenge/redemption. Script is muddled and action sequences are forced, implausible, and predictable. This one bored me.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|Would have been nice to know it is not compatible with my kindle fire before I purchased it.......waste of money.
0399255370|5.0|I got this for my Granddaughter. She love it, she knows her colors and now thinks of them as little people that she has to take care of.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|This movie was great! I liked it better than any of the other X-Men movies I have seen. Definitely worth watching.
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|This was easily the worst purchase I have ever made. It arrives to me, and it doesn't work out of the box. Out of haggling with it for what seems like ever, I finally get it to connect, and it sometimes randomely disconnects. The thumbsticks are HORRIFIC. They literally left blisters on my thumbs, and no, I'm not kidding. This is the worst controller I have ever used, it's worse than any third party PS2 controller. Please, I'm begging you, don't buy this controller. The MOGA is decent, go with that or the Red Samurai.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I tried to download it but had to cancel so I got it on VUDU.  Much better results<br />Amazon movies don't work
0061373877|5.0|The ways in which Gaiman is able to turn something everday into something completely different is astounding. His later novels are good, but don't seem to hold a candle to his earlier works.
B006M4F67A|4.0|nice to do before bed. it helps me unwind at the end of the day. i don't really care about how much time it takes me to do them.
B002XBVQKW|5.0|This Musical kept my interest all the time.  The quality of the video and audio was good taking into consideration the original releasing date
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Great acting, sorry it did not make it in the American movies.<br />I greatly recommend this movie to my friends
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Excellent futuristic movie.  At the beginning it is a little slow but once the action starts the movie kept my attention all the time.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Pretty full throttle hard to explain the intensity.Unless you have been in a firefight.You have never truly lived until you have been close to death
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The fault in our stars is one of those books that you just want to read over, and over, and over again!
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|I will pretend that this is not the last book and write a new and better ending in my head.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|This is a fantastic shotgun mic from DSLRs. It delivers crystal-clear sound, assuming you use the right settings. Make sure it's set to the +20 dB gain mode. On my T4i, I switched to a creative mode and then went into the settings. I changed the microphone settings to manual and then turned down the internal amplifier to 4 steps right of zero. You may have to adjust this up or down so that normal sounds fall around -12 dB. Thereafter, the sound was flawless.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game<br /><br />Have a blast after kids go to sleep.  Very addictive can't put it down.  Wish I had a dressing room like the one in the game. Lol<br />Happy hunting guys.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|One of my favorite games.  Lots of fun playing when you are by yourself!  Play Mahjong a lot when I'm bored.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So much better than the Weather Channel app which is junk since they changed it. This one just gives me the weather without the videos, comments and &#34;rewards&#34; for comments. I just want to know what to wear tomorrow...
B009MYARIK|4.0|Love all of her books!  This one started out a little slow, but once it picked up the pace a little, I loved it!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game, breeding cute dragons is my favourite part, the fact that people can add you as a neighbour is a great addition that is missing from a lot of other games. Well done to the devs!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I always find anything I need on this site!! My crochet projects have flurished. I LOVE IT!!! A must have!
0321934318|5.0|Excellent book.  Easy to understand.  Extremely well organized step by step directions on how to accomplish all aspects of program operation - with a sense of humor!  Highly recommend
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This is one of those epic style movies that demands your attention.<br />Watch it twice to get all the details you will miss at first viewing.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was wonderful and I think one of the most believable descriptions of a NDE written.  My husband is the most skeptical of the hereafter but he was very silent with his denials after reading it.  We read it together, he with the book I purchased, under the persistence of our daughter who lives 3000 miles away, and I on my Kindle.  The medical details, and the effort you made to help us understand the medical terms you used, was further proof in helping us believe his extraordinary experience.  Thank you Dr. Eben for the effort you made to help us understand - we loved it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am not a big reader, but a few friends recommended this book and I can't put it down!<br />Definitely a must read
B001NLKZUA|5.0|With twists and turns keeping you on your toes, you're sure to get all that you expected from this read! The adventure continues to unravel the past with revealing truthes.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I'm not sure how I stumbled across this, but this is one of my favorite CDs of all time now.  I am not a fan or regular listener of instrumental/classical music, but you don't have to be to enjoy and love Lindsey Stirling's music.  She combines modern sounds of dubstep and electronica with her original violin compositions.  When I listen to this in the car, my 6 year old son &#34;plays the violin&#34; in the backseat, and has even said &#34;I could listen to this all day.&#34;  Check out her youtube videos too.  She's just amazing.
B004D0YB5S|4.0|If you like Charles Bradley, its a no brainer, if you don't it's a brainer? Is that even a thing??
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My family has this on eveything. All enjoy playing this. Very challenging but it makrs you think at the same time.
B000IZ4R1U|1.0|I have seen jars of cheeze whiz that could act, and write a story better than this.  Hubris...>yawn<...whilickers...how original.<br />I know it's supposed to be an action movie, but for pete's sake, support it with a good story and dialog.  What a snooze of a movie.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Am Jewish but really enjoyed the read. It taught me a lot about my own tradition and helped me understand Christianity .
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Hard to believe he's 77 years old. He hasn't lost a thing, and if you like anything he's ever done, you'll love this.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Great facial expressions and sound effects convey humor without words. The whole family will watch and laugh from age 3 to 58.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is good and I couldn't put it down. I hate that I have to wait for the next book to be released but I have no choice but to be patient.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|The whole family enjoyed this movie! I loved the music and that he learned to believe in himself. It has been a while since I watched it , but it was really one of my favorite family movies.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoy this series and could not put it down until it was done. Will keep reading her books have not been disappointed yet.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I like that it shows people who make mistakes can redeem themselves. The kids are so cute and it is a good lesson for children.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. Chevy Chase was at his best in here along with the rest of the cast. I laughed through the whole movie
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I have a stressful job this tool has given me so much relaxation. I am creating amazing art. I have printed some and am making thank you cards. you hit a home run with this program. The best on the market in my opinion. I don't draw well but now I really do with flow paper. Awesome creation truly worthy of 10 stars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A captivating and addictive, fictional period drama. The characters and their arcs continue to entertain and challenge audiences in this season.
B00ECUX7HC|4.0|I've been waiting for this follow-up to their first cd. This one is may be just a bit better than their first. You won't be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love these kinds of games. hurry please withe the next levels. I really enjoyed playing and have always been a fan of these type of puzzles.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The graphics in this game are beautiful, just what we've come to expect from big fish offerings. Game play itself. Is just hard enough to engage without becoming frustrating.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Fabulous acting and incredible performances musically make this movie a top pick.  The actors sing their way into your heart and you can truly feel the struggles each of the characters have during the film.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|My son has seen this movie at least 10 times i did like the movie the first 2 times i seen it but it sure got to be real old to me after<br /> the second time.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new update is a dud! I have depended on this app for over two years. I loved it! it was simple and I could see hour by hour or the whole week on start up. Now there is all this crap before I can even get to my weather. I hate all the ads and stuff and it slows my kindle way down. I would rather pay for the old version. I have uninstalled this.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|I have seen this movie 3 times and i liked it more and more each time i seen it.<br />This is a movie that is easy to miss things and when i had the time to see it again i seen things i did not see the first time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have been playing this game now 168 days striaght and I love it because it is not a &quot;demanding&quot; game but rather relaxing and fun though I wished it was easier to get acorns!
B00D9COXZY|5.0|I really enjoy being able to stream my movies to any of my devices regardless of where I am. It's nice to not worry about carrying around or damaging movies and music when traveling.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like it and so does my sister. Any of you who are playing it save your gems don't waste it. The game is really awesome
B0086700CM|5.0|My nieces convinced me to get this for my kindle because they adored it, and it's a very addictive game! I've enjoyed playing it and my kids can't wait to get a crack at it as well. I picked up the free version and I've not had any obtrusive or bothersome ads. It'll eat up battery life if you play for hours and hours - easy to do when you get into playing - but other than that I've loved it!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I'm 20 years old and I did not think that I would like this game. The animals are so cute and there are so many. It's really easy to play.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I have this game on my laptop and it's always been a favorite for me, so I was thrilled to put it on my Kindle so I could have a game to play while waiting at appointments and such. It doesn't have the tip or clue option, which is a bummer, but overall I enjoy it. It's worth picking up, and the free version doesn't have any annoying or bothersome big ads. There's a small one on the left, but I've found it easy to ignore. It's not obtrusive. Enjoy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is such a heartfelt story. It's a quick read because it is short and you can't put it down.
B002NJWHHA|1.0|Christopher Paolini wrote a masterpiece.<br />This directer destroyed that masterpiece.<br />Barely anything was correct in the storyline, character development was horrifying and it was an extremely shallow, quick (and no that's not good) abomination. I couldn't even finish watching. A few things changed is understandable, it is a movie and it is hard to get all of the details sometimes, that's okay. But this...oh my lord...this was the worst movie, as well as the worst reproduction I have ever seen.<br />It's as if the director skimmed the book and then threw some scenes together. It is missing so many details, so many VERY important scenes that it's disgusting.<br /><br />the ONLY thing I have to praise about this movie is Saphira. Great CGI and exactly as I imagined her. Eragon, Roran, and Ayra are as I imagined them also.<br /><br />Let's just say Paolini painted a beautiful work of art that threw you into another dimension...<br />and this director's reproduction of is was like a kindergartener trying to mimic DaVinci.<br /><br />Absolutely horrifying. DO NOT WATCH
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|If you are looking for a game that is easy to start playing and fun to keep on playing, then Monkey Boxing should definitely ring your bell !!  The touch screen controls could not possibly be more simple to use....even though the rotation control for the in-bout challenge and the training is a bit tricky.... so soon you will be pummeling your monkey opposition into submission !!
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Just started watching Breaking Bad from Season 1-5. They are all awesome. Great viewing.  Exciting, thrilling and exceptional acting on all parts.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This show was great.I wish it went on longer than two seasons. But I would rewatch it again and again.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Other reviews are probably more detailed, but REALLY, if you've made it this far in the series, just read the darn thing! Most of the book is consumed by the final battle.  In previous books, the battle scenes felt so drawn out and left me feeling bored.  Somehow this one kept my attention and felt less-long, even though it consumed so much of the book's plot.  Also, I always loved Rand, even when he was a super-dou*he, and for me this was a bit of a redemption for his character.  I'm sure others would disagree.<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad I powered through and finished the series, but I'm even happier that it's finally over.
B00336C3EY|5.0|I had deferred hearing that it was deadly - it is actually excellent.  I highly recommend to my divorce lawyer friends
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Fabulous movie; Jessica Chastain is superb!  Great historical story and seems to be factual.  Should have won &#34;Best Movie&#34; Oscar.
B002N57KG2|3.0|This orange cover video was dubbed in Mexico, I would assume the white cover is the original at a higher cost.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|I just love seeing this cast together again; too much fun!  I really enjoyed the movie, a little light on plot, but very enjoyable.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|This was my teenage daughter's introduction to &#34;the other side of World War 2&#34; and she (a 17-year-old who is bulletproof, invisible, and knows everything) absolutely loved it.  I often hear cries of &#34;Los!&#34; when she wants to express her displeasure at bad drivers on the freeway.  If that doesn't prove that the movie had an impact, I don't know what would.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Lee Child's books are very entertaining and I was very disappointed to see Tom Cruise as a 6'5&#34; Jack Reacher, but he did a credible job.  I did enjoy the movie . .
B0024HH32A|5.0|I love breaking out this movie from time to time.  Hard to think of war as a comedy-- but in so many ways it does show the absurdity and atrosity of war and still allows you to laugh
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I started playing this game three days ago and I love it I recommend that you should get this app it is awesome
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I've seen the new one in theaters and had to check out the first. I'm glad i did too !
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This movie is great my girlfriend love it, that's why I bought it, was a great gift for her .
B00006674X|4.0|This was a gift for a relative. He already had seen this movie and knew he would like it. He was thrilled to own it on DVD and be able to watch it again.
B004UOE7VA|4.0|Some of the songs are amazing, and other are ok. I really loved this move ad this soundtrack re-mix is great
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is awesome! There are so many options to edit your picture with. You can change the color, fix red eye, and even put a frame on the edited picture!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Very good music. In love with Radioactive, especially after watching Lindsey Stirling on youtube. Overall great stuff!! You will love it too hopefully
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The entire series is a must read!!! I couldn't get enough of these books. Once you start, you can not put them down!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Each adventure stands on its own, but is neatly tied to previous books. The wit of John Corey is very amusing and you immediately like his sarcasm. Each episode just keeps getting better and better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The entire series is a must read!!! I couldn't get enough of these books. Once you start, you can not put them down!
0553382179|5.0|This book really did help me to get myself and my house organized without working myself to death. It is all done 15 minutes at a time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved all of these books!!! Once you start, you just can't put them down. I didn't sleep! A must read series.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|I think you should watch this movie...yeah, that'd be great!!<br /><br />Also I'm gonna need you to come in on Sunday!!!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|My best read of the year, great wordsmith,lovely clear images, unpredictable in it's plot, gentle and moving, can't wait for his next...great book.
B0098A70Y2|3.0|Was a bit disappointed it did not have the more common nursery rhymes that my 14 month enjoys. He still enjoys the DVD though
B00AL6SLQS|5.0|Leon Fleisher is one of the great pianists of our time.  This collection of excellent performances  is very welcome.  I personally purchased it because I wanted the recording of the Brahms F minor Piano Quintet.  The performance has exceeded my expectations.  There are many other excellent performances here(including the group with the Cleveland Orchestra, George Szell conducting.<br /><br />One word of caution.  Some of these disks contain less than 40 minutes of music.  This is obviously because Sony wanted to reissue these performances with their original record sleeves.  This did not bother me but some may not like that.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME.  I WAS JUST INTRODUCED TO IT TODAY.  I MADE IT TO LEVEL 10 &amp; DISCOVERED NO MORE LEVELS.  WE NEED MORE LEVELS!!!!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I like the excellent character development.  Plot is neither too slow, nor too fast.  I can really lose myself in the characters and stories.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This movie is the most complex and incredible movie I have ever seen. Leonardo DiCaprio was amazing, as well as Ellen Page. I'm not going to go into an in-depth review because you can find those elsewhere, but all I can say is that the plot is complicated enough that not all minds will be able to fully comprehend it, and those who can't are the people that give it bad reviews.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|This is definitely the best covert ops/terrorism/murder book I have read this year. Whether it gets into my top 10 best thrillers depends on how long it remains in my memory. There is a lot to remember in a complex 700 page book that left me with so many impressions - intelligent and clever, superbly and deeply plotted, brilliant characterisation, ambitious, enthralling, page-turning, action-packed and mostly unpredictable.<br /><br />Pilgrim is the codename chosen by a man who doesn't want to exist. An adopted son of a wealthy family he has always been a loner and after college becomes part of an unknown covert US government group. After becoming the star operator in the group in an operation in Russia he goes into anonymous retirement and writes an obscure book under a pseudonym about the forensic background to the perfect crime. Can anyone commit the perfect crime using this information?<br /><br />On the other side of the world in Saudi Arabia another youth grows up in a world where his father is beheaded for being reported to the secret police for criticising the King. This leads him into a life dedicated to Islam but also a life dedicated to eliminating the US, the country who supports the Saudi regime and fights his fundamentalist Islamic ideals. This is the birth of a terrorist called Saracen, a loner with long term plans to change the world.<br /><br />Hayes takes us on an epic and unpredictable journey by Pilgrim to solve a perfect crime and at the same time find Saracen before he can deliver a far greater blow to the US than a nuclear holocaust. The action moves from the US to Afghanistan, Lebanon, the Gaza Strip, and Turkey in a maze of seemingly unconnected events and builds up to a potentially cataclysmic ending.<br /><br />Along the way Terry Hayes sows seeds that grow in unexpected parts of the plot. Sometimes I spotted the seeds but rarely worked out where they would grow. This cleverly designed unpredictability was to me the keystone of Haye's writing powers. At the end of the book he reflects that he had been told that writing a movie is like swimming in a bath and writing a novel is like swimming in the ocean. With his writing skills I think that Hayes would have no difficulty swimming across the (literary) Channel.<br /><br />Terry Hayes has had a remarkable writing career as a journalist, and TV and movie screenwriter in Australia and the US and this novel is the start of what could become an important career as a novelist. Dame Gail Rebuck, CBE (Chair of Penguin Random House) has reportedly called it \\"The best debut thriller since Day of the Jackal\\".

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Cute movie but not a great movie. It Seemed to fake and a was like watching he same story line as the original Wizard of Oz.
B005KDDUVS|5.0|Este libro sencillamente me cautivó. Disfruté de su lectura desde el inicio hasta el fin. Disfruté de sus personajes, de sus descripciones y de toda la trama. Se convirtió en un clásico para mi. Lo recomiendo totalmente.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Book offers great insight on historical origins and underlying social-political climate of Christianity's inception, which helps frame the rationale for some cultural values that were imparted to the Western world and influential in its transformation and modern development.<br /><br />While some readers, as Christians, may have hang-ups or a reflexive bias against an author who is affiliated with the Islamic faith, I commend him for his scholarly integrity and discipline to avoid implicit or overt injections of his own religious tenets into this work, but instead deal with the facts or evidence presented to him.<br /><br />Personally, as a Christian, the book challenged me to intellectually redefine my religious beliefs without shaking the foundation of my faith in the ideal of Christianity's core message and further strengthened my conviction in the principles for which Jesus, as man or messiah, essentially stood, i.e. social justice, self-empowerment, and compassionate love for brothers and sisters.<br /><br />A good read and quite educational from a historical perspective...
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|It took forever for them to ship it and I had to beg for an update.  Got it and it doesn't sync to loseit or any other app.  I have the Withings scale and love it however, this is not a reason to buy their tracker.  I just bought the Fitbit one and love it.  The Withings tracker battery has short life.  The sleep data has gotten lost or miss sync'd 3 times already.  the pulse function is finicky.  I have both now and will never buy from Withings again,.  German companies idea of service is different then what we want here in USA.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've never read any type of books like this before.However, upon coming across a little&#34;blip&#34; in one of my Good Housekeeping magazines it tweaked my interest and I ordered book one for my Kindle. By the time I finished it I couldn't wait to get book 2 which I'm almost finished reading now. And of course, I will order the third book also. How could I not!  Wow... I'll have to say I've received quite an education on a subject I knew nothing about. I guess I've lead a pretty sheltered life...

B000OLGCI4|5.0|The Jungle Book animated movie by Disney is a classic for all time and the perfect family movie.  Based on Rudyard Kiplings book of the same name published in 1894 and has been a favorite ever since.  Walt Disney adapted the story for the screen play and added some of the best songs ever written for film and utilized some of the greatest talent for narration, voice-overs, music, scripting, animation, and character design.  While Disney has put out many movies over the decades since Walt began his timeless journey, and many films became very popular in their day, The Jungle Book will stand as one of the all time greats along with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Mary Poppins, 101 Dalmatians, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan and Cinderella to name a few.  If have decide what movie to buy your children, this one and others listed should top the list, not just for your children or grandchildren, but for your own viewing as well.  It never grows old and is enjoyable every time you watch it.  Don't miss this one!
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|Truly a classic. My daughter was required to read it. I like to know what they are reading, so I did too.

0316228532|5.0|Jkr always is very discriptive writter. Although i would rather be reading another harry potter book. This story will tide me over.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Like this show.  I do not really like the lead female character, but she is essential to the story.  Looking forward to following this series.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray] is a hot movie to have. This movie is a classic to have.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love the game because of all the animals you can get.  I love this game it is so much fun.  This is my six year olds review
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book, I can't wait to see what they do with the movie...however I was surprised by the ending, and not to spoil, I won't say anything else.  Overall...I would totally recommend this to peeps.
0553801473|5.0|this book along with A Feast for Crows are definitely the most uneventful of the series, but Martin has such a beautiful way with words and an understanding of story structure that they were both still interesting to read. This one is a noticeable amount better than Feast though. You must keep in mind too that these books are a series meant to be read together. So yes, Feast and Dance were, for the most part, uneventful but much in the way that most of the first two books were and the first halfish of A Storm of Swords. That is to say 4 and 5 are almost purely build up. A Game of Thrones built up to its own climax while A Clash of Kings had the good fortune to be able to include the The Battle of the Blackwater, and Storm was just pumped full of plot points (God, what a great novel). The point being that this book is still worth the read, as is Feast, simply because of what it's building up to. At least that's what the books have led me to expect from the next installment...
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Writing style is engaging.  Its hard to believe some men have the type of courage to place themselves in these type of situations.  I enjoyed it.  I wish we had not lost this hero too soon.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Realistic characters, excellent plot line, and fine acting in this who done it series. Wish the entire series was available to watch.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|it have many different levels and many types of patterns to work with. it is a fun game to have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I began reading this series 1 1/2 weeks ago and finished it last night. To tell the truth I only purchased it because I saw the great reviews...I'd never heard of Mr. Howey and the story line did not seem that interesting. Boy! Was I wrong! I loved it. The writing is superb and the plot turns and twists and does amazing somersaults. I will read more of his books and hope you will too.
075669812X|5.0|I chose this rating because I have no complaints. The order came before the estimated date, it was in perfect condition, and the price was the best i found. I would recommend this to any other parents who have children that are HUGE Lego Ninjago fans!
B005USZML4|5.0|This was a hard book to put down...finished in only 2 days! Not the typical Grisham book, but a fun series for sure. I will be checking out the other Theodore Boone titles. Seemed a little short, but I guess all great books do.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Makes a great game and style of the year in love it so much I know that whoever gets this app will get it. This app is priceless
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A good scavenger hunt and puzzle game. You need to use your wits and problem solving skills on every level. It keeps you on your toes.
B004T6IBNY|4.0|It is an easy game to play and a good way to use up time if you are waiting for an appointment.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Good movie, overall streaming was good. No complaints would watch again with family...would recommend to friends to watch and use instant video.
B003G4W49C|3.0|I wanted to read the book as it has been made into a movie, which is to be released soon with Harrison Ford. I found the book somewhat enjoyable. But I felt that Book 1 of the series, didn't go as far as I expected for the Movie. I felt that I would need to read all the books in the series to be fully prepared for the movie. In general I try to stay away from books that are a series. If you like these types of stories, the series would be a good choice. I also felt as I was reading that it was geared for the younger readers
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is perfect for horse-lovers. It's easy to use and there are quite a few things you can do and unlock. The graphics are incredible as well.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good rpg for the road or for your lunch break at work or when your bored at night. Requires massive patience if you don't want to spend money in the in app purchasing section, but hey who can complain it's free. I do wish the was a bit more diversity among the enemies and the gear. Still a great game that is fun playing.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Acting in so many different personalities has to be hard and some of them she does better than others. I enjoy the acting and a very interesting story. I haven't finished the series yet.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I did resort to the internet twice when I was stumped but found the game to be very challenging and yet most of the puzzles led you from one activity to the next.  If you do get stumped there is a hint button but it does not point out exactly what to do.  I felt proud that I was able to finish all four chapters. The only thing I don't like we're the creepy noises so I turned off the volume.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|This production is most enjoyable. The writers have done a great job and I have liked all episodes. Can;t wait for the second season.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great story. Cant wait to watch the movie! Definitely recommend for anyone that likes vampires, werewolves and mythological creatures! Download now
B00003CXA6|5.0|Item was in excellent condiition- many thanks as I didn't know I could see again what I had seen years years ago- many thanks
B001BR7CZW|5.0|I cannot imagine anyone not liking this movie...the premise, the cast...the ultimate COOLNESS of it...it's classic!!  If you don't buy this movie and like, there is no hope for you and you need to go see the Penguin...LOL!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This first book is practically word for word of the first Season of Game of Thrones.  It was very enjoyable.  Looking forward to reading the rest!
B003B02OOG|5.0|I thought it was a very good book.  I haven't quite finished it but what I have read so far I really do like it. Besides John Grisham is a very good writer and I have enjoyed reading all of his books.
0064471837|5.0|My mother bought this for me for Christmas when I was in fourth grade, nine years old, along with The Ragwitch.  Foolishly, I opted to read the latter first, putting off Sabriel because the title and cover had me fooled into thinking it was a \\"girly book.\\"<br /><br />I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />From the moment I picked it up and opened to the first page, I was bowled over by Nix's talent for world building and descriptive writing -- the emotions swirling in Sabriel's head when she learned of her father's death, the childish wonder in her eyes when she found Touchstone's figurehead.  Every page contained some hidden gem, some wonderful literary treasure for me to discover, and I found myself actively wondering what would happen next and hoping Sabriel would win out in the end.<br /><br />Since then, I have reread it time upon time again, and each time I turn through its pages, my love for the book and the story contained within only increases.  Sabriel is a wonderful tale of a girl striking out against the world and finding her own place, and it should be a staple in everyone's library.
B0047SKR54|5.0|The video and soundtrack were very good,the film content doesn't have to be spoken for.The very beginning with Jim Morrison singing \\"THE END\\" will always be awesome,rent it, baby!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|OK, so I own all three seasons of this great TV program.  I'm a huge Star Trek fan and this newly remastered DVD series is a MUST own for any Trekkie. The majority of television critics (I guess that's who they are) insist that the first season of this program is the best of the three seasons.  Personally, I prefer the second season, but only by a hair.  The box containing the DVD's is a bit cumbersome to open and close, but it does look cool.  It contains \\"trading cards\\" with the episode menu and while they are cool, it can also be a bit awkward to shuffle through them to find a particular episode.  That's about the extent of any negative criticism that I have about this particular box set.  The revamped special effects and overall improved quality is brilliant and really brings a fresh new look without comprimising the integrity of the series/program itself.  In fact, it makes the whole show even better!  The colors are bright, clean, and sharp and there's no graininess.  I think the program can hold it's own against present television programs with every single special effect being generated by a mouse click on a computer.  I suppose the only other REAL criticism that I have is the PRICE!!!  It's very expensive!  I spent $35 on a new copy!  I can assure you that if it were not \\"Star Trek\\", I wouldn't pay that price.  I did it THREE times! Once for each season.  Fortunately for me, it's worth it!  I've never spent that kind of money on a DVD.  OK, in summation; If you are a Trekkie or just like the show, this is a worthy investment that will bring hours and hours (Three full days worth if you buy all three seasons and watch them one right after the other)of great entertainment.  As for me, I've finally got ALL the Star Trek (The Original Series)episodes, it's time to work on owning some \\"Dr. Who\\" now!
B0052GACNM|5.0|Better than expected - Bennett at his best  -  looking forward to his next effort - but this time with some different duet partners
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is probably the best game you can get on the kindle fire I play it every chance I get I have played it on the Pc and xBox those myself are better though.
B001L5YW9I|3.0|Daniel Day-Louis is one of our top actors but you'd never know it from this underwhelming role and an invincible Native American who never misses a shot. Predictable.<br /><br />A few good violence scenes, what you'd expect from a film made by the guy who came up with Miami Vice.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I've been a JT fan for years n have long anticipated a new album. I played it over n over for days. I think this would appeal to a lot of people.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|loved it one of those books I couldn't put down with a twist great read  cant wait to see the movie
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Impressive graphics and true to the rules of Magic. The campaign mode provides a good story and the cut-scenes are well done. I play on my Kindle fire and haven't had any trouble.
1416955070|5.0|I really love The Mortal Instruments series and find it addicting. I finished all the books in a week because I couldn't stop reading them. I really love how Cassandra wrote Jace and Simon, my two favorite characters from the books. Every one is comparing it to Twilight or Harry Potter and there may be a few similarities, but it is completely it's own story that spans six books and I love every minute of it. We learn so much about these characters that its hard not to get attached. So its going to be difficult for me to finish the sixth book and the series I love so much be finished.
B00C3JU7D6|1.0|The record skipped. I sent it back and the second one skipped worse. I would love to have one that does not skip.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Due to all the hype, I really thought this would be good, but it was just a variation of the \\"Running Man\\" or \\"Logans Run\\" movies.  Same old story with a different setting.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Love the graphics. They are very much the same as the Xbox 360 version which fits the HD quality of my kindle. The gameplay is very polished and fits the magic card game irl. Only solid complaint is the lack of full deck customizations but I understand where the game developers are coming from. This makes multiplayer a little easier for newer players by having it easy to get used to standard decks.
B0037QO8XE|5.0|I loved how easy was to rent the video and watch it immediately.  The quality of the video was oustanding.  Precious isn't a easy movie to watch.  It takes us to a deep family disfunction in which many people may find painful reflections.  In general, renting this movie was a good experience in every sense, I am glad I did it and enjoy it.  Thank you.
B007AL48UK|4.0|I enjoyed this game. Sometimes it is hard to identify which tiles are matches, but the help or clue button was easy to use. The shapes of the puzzles are different and fun.
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|Christian Bale really saves this movie.  He somehow manages to make his character three dimensional and interesting, in a movie where everything else (the characters, the story, the dialogue, the directing) is not very much of either.  You care about what happens to Bale's character, and that's mostly due to his acting.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I like the original but this sucks.  They make you pay.. ridiculous..<br />I  don't see what people see..  walking around in circles<br /><br />Makes  no sense..
B007AL48UK|3.0|I'm frustrated and addicted to this game.  While I enjoy playing it, most of the puzzles are unsolvable.  I don't mind having hard puzzles, but I'd like to be able to win one once in a while.  The game also tends to lock up for no good reason.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is fun....my daughter tries to beat me on the timings and she has. Well, her daughter, my granddaughter, has beat us both. I have tried over and over to beat her score and have yet to do it...oh, well, fun trying.
B006G2124E|5.0|Awesome movie!  It hit me really hard, and I'm now embarrassed to be white because of these maids' treatments by their employers!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Best book of the series. Great ending, can't wait to read more of riordans books. I recommend reading the others first.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Best app....fun!!  Great game...even the kids enjoy playing it with me.  Great app to pass time.  A little easy at first, but gets a little more challenging as you go.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it! This game is definitely a lot of fun. I play this for hours at a time. It really is addicting!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Gotta say I love this app. Fun, fun, fun. Keeps you on your toes and just love being productive. Love being able to see your progress as your town grows and grows. Can't stop playing it. Wish it had ways to get free money and energy though as it does get expensive...FAST. I would watch ads or sign up for things if it gave me free things np. Would be an awesome update to see.
030758836X|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. The author keeps us guessing throughout and the writing is great. Flynn has a morbid sense of humor and it comes through in her characters actions/thoughts/dialogue. I usually don't read mystery/thrillers and prefer straight up social satires by authors like: Maria Semple, Brett Easton Ellis or Helen Argiro, but after reading Gone Girl, I am definitely adding Gillian Flynn to the list!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book because my daughter read it to her 3 children and wanted me to read it so we could talk about it together and watch the movie together when I visited them in Chicago last week.  It was a wonderful book for children and adults,  with beautiful word pictures<br />that draw you into the story and makes you want to keep reading to<br />find out what happens to the lovable characters.  Well worth the read!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is the best bingo I have played I play every day I never get tired of it some of the other ones I tried are not worth my time
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Great fun to watch, the Stones were great to see, young and enjoying one of their icons.  Recommend buying if you enjoy just seeing the old ones at their best.
B004UH84Z2|5.0|I've always loved Austen.  Now I can read it on airplanes and not carry heavy stuff in my carry-on.  I own the whole set in old editions.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Movie was good. Love Ryan G. but a little dry in some parts. its ok, good enough to watch once
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I had to go to cheats to solve nearly half of the levels. Maybe I'm just not used to these escape games and how to find clues, but I have not been satisfied with any of the ones I've tried including this one!

B00C7BZYRO|4.0|\\"The Spectacular Now\\" (2013 release; 95 min.) brings the story of Sutter (played by Miles Teller), a HS senior who is enjoying life in the moment, with no worry in the world as long as he has his whisky flask or other alcoholic beverages nearby (which is all the time). One day Sutter gets dumped by his girlfriend Cassidy and after a drunken night out, he wakes up in someone's front yard (not knowing how he got there). He gets found by Aimee (played by Shailene Woodley), a HS classmate of his. Aimee is the complete opposite of Sutter in every which way: withdrawn, smart, considerate. Yet Sutter takes an interest in her. Along the way, we learn that Sutter is dealing with `daddy issues'.  His dad left when he was a little kid. Sutter confronts his mom to try and get his dad's contact details. Will Aimee fall for Sutter? what about the other way around? And what's with this mysterious past of Sutter's dad? why did Sutter's parents really break up? To tell you much more of this plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments:  this is the third feature film from director James Ponsoldt, who just last year brought us another top quality indie movie called Smashed (starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul). Interestingly, alcohol dependency also plays a critical role in this movie. The script is based on the book by Tim Tharp (I did not read the book, so cannot comment to what extent, if any, the movie's plot deviates from the book). Despite the gorgeous movie poster and the cute trailer for the movie, \\"The Spectacular Now\\" is at times not an easy movie to watch, in the sense that Sutter is a mostly unlikeable and self-absorbed jerk whom you'd like to give a slap in the face and yell \\"wake up!\\". When Sutter gets dumped by Cassidy, his boss at work comments \\"I really thought she would be the one to yank you out of neutral\\", to which Sutter responds \\"But I'm in overdrive!', completely clueless. All the more credit to Teller for playing this character with authority and credibility. But what about Woodley's performance! After playing lead in TV's \\"The Secret Life of the American Teenager\\", she burst out of nowhere on the big screen a few years ago in \\"The Descendants\\" (playing George Clooney's on-screen daughter). It is Woodley's screen time that makes this movie as enjoyable as it is in the end. And if you wonder about that quote I put in my review title: just watch the movie...<br /><br />This movie made a splash when it debuted at the Sundance film festival earlier this year, and it's easy to see why. So glad this finally made it to Cincinnati. This opened here today at the local art-house theatre, and the matinee screening that I saw this at was very well attended, I am happy to say. I read somewhere that this movie was shot on a budget of just $2.5 mill., mere peanuts in Hollywood terms, and proving once again you don't needs a comic action hero or a $200 mill. budget to make a movie that engages the audience. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a top quality indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. \\"The Spectacular Now\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ely clueless.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved the book.  The dog had a great insight on life.  His inability to communicate made you aware that sometimes it is hard to get your ideas or opinions across to others.  It was a quick and enjoyable read.
B00DJUPLY8|4.0|This app seems intuitive and complete.  I was hoping, however, that the WMA support would extend to WMDRM files.  My Galaxy S2 was able to play DRM'd music which I downloaded from the Zune Marketplace because the S2 had support for WMDRM built in.  I've tried a bunch of different players and asked the question on androidcentral about why this support was dropped an whether it could be added.  I haven't really made progress.<br />Maybe the dev reads this and has way more technical knowledge than I do and can put this together.  I'll be watching this app!
0988262592|5.0|I received this book as a gift (what fun to get books as gifts!).  I'm not in IT and although I consider myself a fairly sophisticated user of computers, I wouldn't say I know too much about what goes on behind the scenes in an IT department.  However, I was captured within the first chapter when the lead character gets a promotion that no one announces!  If you've ever worked in any type of business that was a huge cluster-fluff, you'll thoroughly enjoy this book.  It presents a business model in the form of a novel, which I love.  Nothing like throwing in interesting characters, and a great plot to get your point across and teach your reader.  I believe this is a book you'll enjoy reading, regardless of how tech savvy you are.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love the movie and love the price we paid.  We got the editors disc's which made the movie even more interesting.  Funny and if you like music ...very good
B0060CXAHC|5.0|We love ohana! Ohana means family and family means no one get left behind!  We love our family.  Thank you
B001XUT6AG|5.0|As the &#34;final voyage&#34; of the original crew, our beloved and intrepid space-farers once again save the galaxy from disaster.  Every actor was hitting their marks and poured themselves into their parts.  Most notable, in my opinion, was George Takei's portrayal of Captain Sulu; it was a shame that we didn't get to see more of him either in this or in later movies.  The storyline is good and fun, as long as you keep your nerd-fact checking to minimum.  (Dozens of paper-bound books to translate the Klingon phrases?  really?  We have lost Kindle in the 23rd century?)  Overall, a great film.... there are moments for every Trek fan and even non-Trekkies will enjoy the action/mystery/political intrigue that is weaved throughout the script.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Deceptively simple take on a piece of equipment that apparently brought much joy to a wide range of musicians, some of which are featured in this film.  Re-wind; that piece of equipment brought a lot of joy to the public at large and it is to the filmmakers' credit his hand was not overplayed.<br /><br />Mr. Grohl does a fine job of allowing the story of the soundboard and past moments in its' history to stand on the merits.<br /><br />Wonderful and enlightening; solid five stars.
B00A83075M|4.0|The graphics leave much to be desired.  However, the story is a good one.  Like how they reference bad guys from other video games.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|I almost turned off the movie after the first hour.  It was so slow paced and boring!  Luckily there was eventually an interesting plot twist and it got more interesting.  But I can't recommend this movie.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The minions are adorable.  Make sure you get the edition that has the mini-movies.  The mini-movies are great for watching something quick.  My kids will even ask to include a mini-movie as a bedtime story, LOL.  Be sure to watch this one before watching Despicable Me 2... you really need to know the background on Gru.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Just as good as the seasons before this one.  The characters are richly developed, I enjoy the recurring characters, and the plots are clever.
B00947N6D8|5.0|The kids will sit and watch this movie over and over.  The Santa Claus character is very entertaining for adults also, &#34;Shoo with your pointy heads.&#34;  The kids laugh and laugh. (me too.)
B0058RCVYS|3.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  It was unique and engaging and the story line sucked me in.  But it wasn't a movie I'd watch again.

B00007AJF8|5.0|This is a great movie.  Fun to see Cusak and Diaz early in their careers.  Try it, you'll like it!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I like it a lot  it keeps you thinking.  Keep up the good work and keep them coming. Really sweat!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Exciting, suspensful, full of action.  The characters are well developed and you really like them.  If you plan to see Red 2, this movie builds up the characters so you don't have to figure out their relationships.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was great you really had to think a little on some of the rooms but I got through.  I love it please get some more.. fast!!  I can not wait.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters on Downton Abbey are compelling... I missed this when it first came out so watched the first 3 seasons fairly obsessively.  The time period is fascinating to me, with all the changes going on in the world during that time, and then the characters' growth and struggles with the changing times add to the interest.  I eagerly await the next season!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|This was horrible.  I had such high hopes too.  The characters weren't explained, the missing characters weren't explained, things kept happening that weren't explained, and the plot twists and no real purpose.  I came away feeling that I wanted my rental money back.  Not even the action was believable.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|We've always loved the TV series and this movie provides closure to the whole story. We like the marriage between western and sci-fi genres.
B005JR47R6|5.0|Excellent ending to a great series.  I will miss House, and the final season was a tribute and a tasteful way for it all to end.
B002361MLA|5.0|So many times when reading this life-changing book, I said to myself, &#34;I know that is true.&#34; Every page resonates with spiritual yet practical wisdom.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I will start out by admitting I'm a big Doctor Who fan.  I like the Matt Smith era, and the interconnection of the people and stories as they travel through time.  This year was a wild ride that balanced nicely the timeless adage that all good things must come to an end, and every end is a new beginning.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I have read this author before and have liked all his books. This one held my interest from start to finish. Very exciting
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this everywhere.  I have notebooks inside Evernote for home, for my profession, for my family, etc.  It is very versatile, you can share notebooks, edit anywhere you have the internet, and add photos and links.  A great app, highly recommended.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie is entertaining without being awful.  I think the actor who played Michael Oher did a good job.  And the fact that it's based on Michael Oher's real life journey into football made it more fun.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this game is awesome!! got it for my kids (6 and 8) and they love it!! I play it sometimes too!! lol!! and Im 30! :)<br />i like the fact that it makes the kids think strategy! it's a super fun game!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best series I have ever seen.I can't wait for season 3. I stayed up all night watching.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Very oddly written and very confusing at times. Just a few lines or scenes were in the movie. Not what I expected at all.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Satire is the most delicate of comedic endeavors. Dr. Strangelove may be the very best example of satire on film. The situation is frighteningly plausible yet the characters that carry the film are bold tropes, caricatures of high comedy yet real and believable, When President Muffly admonishes General Buck Turgedson who is attempting to strangle the Russian ambassador exclaiming &#34;This is the War Room. There's no fighting in the War Room.&#34; the irony is hilarious. And every scene has its LOL ironic moment right up until the B-52 pilot rides the bomb down over Russian soil. The film is simply brilliant--perhaps the best comedic satire of all time.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|What do you expect from a movie made about toys, and a kid's comic book? Lots of inane action (not that it's even technically or tactically accurate) and wasted talent. I was engaged for the first 30 minutes.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Excellent book- it takes the reader back and forth from the early 1900s to the year 2005 - with a few stops in the 1970s as Cassandra uncovers the mystery of her Grandmother's past. It's an amazing tale spun over a century of time and an ocean, 2 continents, and in a secret garden.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I like this movie. Bruce Willis is very good in his role. I knew when I saw this picture that there would be a part two.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Exciting and action packed story that will have you coming back for more! Awesome start to a great book series.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I had not see the movie when it was in the theatre so viewed this on Amazon Prime.  Great movie!!  My husband and I both enjoyed it thoroughly.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Need I say more.  I guess I need to say more since sixteen words are required to post something. Kind of kills the effect of what I was saying, but if they require more, I'll write more, 'cause I can ramble when it's necessary.  Don't want to be writing too little even if few words are require to make a point.  I realize there are rules to follow whether they make sense or not. Well, I guess I do have trouble rambling.  WoooHooo, Joe's new album. Not Sloe Gin but still loads better than mainstream crap promoters try to feed us.
B005SAP45I|4.0|Got this for my grandkids while they were visiting for a week.  All three of them thoroughly enjoyed it.  My review is pased on their reaction as I did not watch the movie myself.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|this was a cute movie. Not much of a comedy but it was interesting. I liked the spin it put on the whole zombie concept.
B002JIBA8W|4.0|We viewed this on our Amazon Prime account.  Whole family was visiting and ur grandsons liked it very much.  It only got 4 stars because of the language.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This season was really out there compared to the first season. It was kind of hard to folllow with all of the random evil stuff going on rather than just paranormal evil from the first one.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|I had not yet seen this movie so I rented it at the recommendation of my daughter.  I remember this period in our history so well and the movie was absolutely sensational.  After watching it I went back and watched a couple of others from the same period of time . . . \\"The Long Walk Home\\" among them.  We've come a long way since that era but we still have a long way to go.  I recommend this moving to everyone but particularly to young people who do not live in the South and have no idea how difficult these times were.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|It was an interesting story but kind of sad. I usually prefer upbeat comedies but this came recommended by a friend.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Fantastic in companion to the TV series, and a really enjoyable read for anyone who enjoys this genre, or has seen the series.
B000M5AJQI|4.0|I thought this was a great movie. Lots of twists and turns. It keeps you guessing through the whole movie.
B0094K1K42|3.0|just one of those movies when your board and have nothing else to do, kind of funny. kind of out there movie.
B003MC5N28|5.0|At first the title scared me, but after the first couple pages.... I was hooked.  I could not put the book down.  I stayed up past my bedtime by 4 hours.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Great stories and great acting continued in Season 2...now watching Season 3.  I highly recommend the series to everyone who enjoys interesting characters and non-formula stories.
0064471837|5.0|This was the first series of books I had ever read as a child in middle school and ever sense I have been searching for anything that even comes close to giving me the feeling that this series did.  I was captivated from the first page of Sabriel to the last page of Abhorsen.  Each character is unforgettable.  No chapter is dull.  I recommend this book and the entire series to anyone who reads, not just fiction fans or teens.
B00D3V97DO|5.0|Classic sound that can only be reproduced with Ozzy.  Love it; never stop writing!  I give you Five stars for capturing that old &#34;sound&#34; from the 70s.  Striking!
B000JBWWBK|4.0|I had watched the movie &#34;A Good Year&#34; before I ordered the cd of the music.  One of the things I really liked in the movie besides the beautiful scenery of France was the music, and that is what led me to buy the cd. The songs are just light and uplifting, and I listen to them while I'm doing housework - makes it a more pleasant experience.  I would recommend this music to anyone who likes to enjoy a variety of different types of music.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Peter Olivia Walter & Astrid!  We will miss you all so much.  Great writing.  What's next?  I can't wait to see more along the lines of Fringe.  Tired of the Old being constantly renewed in Hollywood.  Write on with your Bad Selves, lol.
B008J05EL8|1.0|If I could rate it less than 1 star I would.  I bought it, but it won't open.  I wish I had read the reviews.  I want my money back.
B001D09OAI|4.0|always enjoy watching this movie even if it has been many years since seen it. a must for any baseball fan
B00AFEY354|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen.  I bought two of them:  one for me and one for a gift.
B0091X4EYK|5.0|... too bad they are not as close to the books' plots as they should be.  The music is great also
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book  it really kept my interest I couldn't wait to find out what happened next I can't wait to read more of this series
B007NESBK2|5.0|I love Sade and this DVD is outstanding. A must have if you want to see and treasure an auesome Sade performance.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app has been great tool for planning my events. The application loaded up on my kindle fire with no issues and works like it should. I lost s few of the settings that are on my phone application, however, they are ones that would effect any operations and were just personal preference types. I would recommend this app to anyone who does not want to get caught short by bad weather at an inopportune time.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I used her experiments after I read the whole book and it works! You really CAN create the life you want. I love that she has taken all this information and broken it down into simple and easy to understand language!! I recommend it to everyone!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Disney attempted to explain how the Wizard of Oz became the Wizard of Oz prior to Dorothy's arrival. While it was a good concept, the movie was poorly executed. The colors and sets in the two 'worlds' were vivid and creative. The acting was hoky and unconvincing. It is sad really because the idea had the potential to be a great story for film.
B009MYARIK|5.0|I'm a big Sophie Kinsella fan and I enjoyed this book like I enjoy all of her books.  Just fun reading.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product has so much potential, the developers just need to keep working on it.  Currently you can only use it with a laptop or an Android device.  It will stream Netflix and anything from your Chrome Browser, but that is about it.  It is essentially a wireless HDMI link that can only display your browser and Netflix . . . FOR NOW!  Please pay attention to the &#34;for now&#34; part, this is a recent device, and the potential is endless.  They can integrate this to work with almost anything, and we know it because AirPlay essentially does the same thing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Normally, I don't go in for soaps, but these episodes are special. They are just so well done and the character development is spectacular. Watch them in order to get a full appreciation of the writing.
B00DDRKDUO|3.0|Well worth a listen but it's nothing new.Bathory was doing this 25 years ago.Title track The Wild Hunt is the standout.
B00A812HOS|2.0|I made the mistake of presuming this would be a good album on the basis of &#34;So Good At Being In Trouble'. It is a great song but most of the rest of the album is rather boring. Most songs sound the same and as a whole the album never really gets going. I've even given it a few tries to see if it is a 'grower'. But no. If you like &#34;So Good At Being In Trouble&#34;, save yourself $20 and just download that one track from iTunes. You won't be missing much.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|It seems in today's shows it is a given that there will be a visceral and gritty approach to the drama. However, back in the late 90s, this show was ahead of its time and redefined the &#34;anti-hero.&#34; A great show for anyone looking for a new theatrical addiction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it is so fun get this app please  get it it could use more updates  and les buges
B00DL09USY|4.0|Well written character studies of the working and leisure classes in Great Britain from the turn of the last century. Margaret and Helen are well intentioned human wrecking balls. With too much time on their hands, they try to improve the life of a poor Clerk (that never asked for their help). First time I read this I hated all of its characters. Fifteen years later after reading it again, I found myself sympathetic to the character I detested most; Charles. Why? Because he has lived in the shadow of his ambitious and wealthy father that can't really express love. Charles is expected to work for his father Henry and act as personal assistant with a financial dependence that won't keep up with his own young growing family after marrying Dolly. Charles must act, think and believe everything his father does and is. Yet, his father, Henry is disgusted and embarrassed when the ugly side of himself is mirrored back to him in Charles. Ah, if only Mrs. Wilcox's last request had been granted of bequeathing her Howard's End home to Margaret upon her death. Fate had intended it so. A nice and easy read to fill up time. And of course, watch the film based on this novel.
0762445262|2.0|i loved it but it arrived extremely  late.
B003B02PEU|5.0|I read this book years ago and, as with all John Grisham books, thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was even more enjoyable the second time.  Can't wait to read his next masterpiece.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I had to be \\"beaten\\" into watching this presentation by the local \\"Director of Entertainment\\" who demanded that we watch it together. That person is my wife. But I was snickering at the sideways verbal jabs by Billy Connolly in the first scene or so, and crying at the interplay between Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay half way through. Since then we have repeated the performance twice and I am sure will do so again, after football season and wrestling seasons are complete.<br /><br />This film is a romance. And with any such adventure, suspension of some disbelief is necessary. The disbelief is about two aspects of the film: (1) that there would be a home for retired opera singers, which could have been the lavish English countryside home selected to stage the TV play Downton Abbey, and (2) that opera music would turn out to be something other than the stereotypical non-melodic \\"screaming\\" in Italian. The effort to suspend disbelief is well rewarded by the first-time director Dustin Hoffman and playwright Ronald Harwood.<br /><br />Harwood's story is about the personal struggles necessary to organize and produce the home's annual concert to celebrate Verdi's birthday. It is this concert which purportedly provides sufficient financial wherewithal to keep these retired musicians in a fulfilling environment unlike that of any recognizable retirement home.<br /><br />But it is Hoffman, supported by Cinematographer John de Borman, who encourages richly colorful characters to interact in a setting lush with natural beauty. Laughter abounds! And there hard words; some tears too. All accompanied by classical, and at the close, joyous vocal operatic music.<br /><br />This is not a movie full of righteous moral fury, nuanced social insight, or unsentimental but devastating drama. What viewers will find is joy - within in the interplay of the characters and within their own hearts.
B00BXKOMT6|3.0|This book was... fine. I don't normally do reviews, but the love this book is getting seems strange to me, so I'm writing this in the hopes that others don't get their hopes up as I did. I certainly don't see the 'this-is-as-good-as' comparisons people are making to established authors like Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson. The storyline was middling, some of the prose felt awkward and though there were some decent scenes in the story, I never felt as if it was particularly compelling - not a book I couldn't put down at any point. The main character never really clicked with me, either.<br /><br />Having said all that, if you lower your expectations (think perfectly acceptable middle-of-the-road self-published fantasy, as opposed to a modern classic), it's a decent enough time-waster if you've already read all the bigger fantasy authors out there.
B00B9366VO|5.0|It was like a time machine bringing back memories of recording studios I was familiar with in the 70s & 80s. Counterpart Creative in Cincinnati, Vintage in Phoenix. Different people, but oh so much the same feeling. I loved what Dave Grohl did to honor a phenomenal time and place in history.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Love IT,, Love It.. Love it..!! Totally Recommend again and again.... Just get it. You wont regret it.  I Promise :)
B009WUBERW|4.0|The Expendables 2 was fun to watch. After it was over I was glad I had watched it free on Amazon Prime. I would not have rated it as highly if I had to pay the normal fee for it. Stalone is really showing his age and since he has come out as anti Second Amendment he should probably quit doing this type of movie. I really liked Chuck Norris and the snake bite. High point of the movie.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|If you are not willing to spend your own money then don't waste your time downloading. Yes you get so many free bingo a day but each game cost those plus. I save credits for a day or two just to play one maybe two rounds.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I cannot get enough of this show.  Very well acted by all cast members.  Great story lines as well.  I cannot wait until the new season is released in the USA.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it also ! I've had this game on my smart phone and my laptop, everyone thinks it is the game of choice.
B0089PWU2E|3.0|53 of the 99 tracks are Buddy Holly, the other half of this box set is \\"Buddy Holly-related\\" material. The Crickets without Buddy, or Buddy playing guitar on friends' sessions. Of the Buddy Holly recordings, a few are of interest due to being slightly different than more commonly issued versions. e.g. I don't recall hearing a gentle sax darting in and out of \\"True Love Ways\\" before, \\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\" includes prominent vocal backing, and so on.<br /><br />Biggest drawback of this set is the sound. Even on the car stereo I can tell that this was assembled from a variety of sources. Some sound pretty good, like \\"Raining In My Heart\\" and \\"It Doesn't Matter Any More\\". Others sound more like cake mixes than audio mixes, as though they were sourced from clean bargain bin releases (like old Pickwick label cheapies). e.g. The guitar hook on \\"What To Do\\" is almost completely lost, sounding like it's coming through the window from the brownstone apartment across the alley or something. Even on the best recordings here there's a definite loss of at least one generation.<br /><br />Normally I don't take sets like this to task for the sound, but then most of this label's series sounds better than this. [[ASIN:B005J59J6W The Belafonte 4 CD set]] was gorgeous, the first 90% of [[ASIN:B005Y05GOQ the James Brown 4 CD set]] was crisp and snappy. A reviewer on Amazon UK notes that a lowpass of 17k has been applied, which suggests that the material compiled for this Buddy Holly set came from compressed sources.<br /><br />If you have no Buddy Holly in your collection this may suffice, but I would say that this is a case where getting the major label compilation [[ASIN:B000002OPE Buddy Holly Collection]] instead is well worth the few extra bucks. That 2 CD set was restored and remastered with tender loving care. I can hear the difference even with the relatively lo-fi players I use. \\"Everyday\\" sourced from the [[ASIN:B000002OPE Buddy Holly Collection]] just sparkles.<br /><br />Most importantly, it may have 50 tracks compared to this Real Gone Jazz label's 53 tracks (plus 46 tracks of \\"other stuff\\"), but the 50 tracks on the other set are the first 50 you'd want in your collection. Notably it includes two of Buddy's best (and my two favorites), the high-revving \\"Down the Line\\" and the rockin' instrumental \\"Holly Hop\\", which are missing in action here. Instead, one of the albums is The Crickets without Buddy. (You remember Leo Sayer crooning \\"More Than I Can Say\\"? The Crickets' original is here, so, well, there you go. But to be fair, also present is the original of Bobby Fuller's hit, \\"I Fought the Law\\".)<br /><br />What I've been seeing lately is that labels like 101 Distribution or Real Gone Jazz will issue these 4 CD sets of physical media, then six to nine months later that same artist will be covered by a bountiful mp3 download collection at about half the price and with none of the clutter of physical media. Let's face it, these box sets don't include anything but the music anyway, they have no competitive advantage over equivalent mp3 downloads of [[ASIN:B00D48O0KG Little Richard]], [[ASIN:B00EETHN1C Lou Donaldson]], [[ASIN:B00DRMG4IK Martin Denny]] and others.<br /><br />Three stars (not intended to be a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Eddie Cochran song about Buddy). Minus one star for the sound, minus one star for half of this box set being filler. I will post the track listing in Comments.st importantly, it may have 50 tracks compared to this Real Gone Jazz label's 53 tracks (plus 46 tracks of \\"other stuff\\"), but the 50 tracks on the other set are the first 50 you'd want in your collection.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Wsssssssssssszzzzszzssssssszzzsssssssss.  That's how fast the bike is when u upgrade all the way and the tank is awesome on volcano u go so far
B00EEXST2K|4.0|This movie has an incredible cast. It was really surprising and electrifying, seeing as how the story twisted and the tone changed. Don't let this one pass you by!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|This took a bit to get the hang of but it is  very interesting with the tidbits of facts you put in while loading. Good shooting game to take frustrations out.
B00821OX98|4.0|Why can't I just give however many stars I think this title deserve and be done with it?<br />Stupid thing.<br /><br />The show is pretty good though.
B00DNO3JUI|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  I love the cinemetography.  Who knew Harvey Keitel was such a fox!  Wonderful acting.  Beautiful love story.
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|Great story to show kids how to betray authority, flaunt adrodgony and do what they want! Plus it has pirates!
B001LIBRL6|5.0|This is classic Woody Allen and it doesn't get any better.  It is funny, witty and romantic.  While some of his later films are hard to follow, the simple message of this romantic comedy is easy to follow and believe in.
B009C7JS14|2.0|I like the old version better. It was more informative.  Please bring it back.<br />  I like the old version much better then this one.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is my second Marware case purchase for a Kindle.  This case, as was the first, is sturdy and does the job.  My wife loves the color, although with so many colors to choose from, anyone's taste can be satisfied.
B002KKCVX2|5.0|They look and feel real durable. The soles are very tough and almost feel like shoes but are still light on your feet. One thing I was not expecting from a sandal was arch support which these sandals have a lot of. Just have to adjust the straps to align your arches with the molding. I feel like I can hike all day in these things. Great buy.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I can honestly say this was the worst movie I have ever seen.  Too bad there's not a zero rating.  I couldn't even finish watching it.  Ugh.
B008476HBM|5.0|The best love story ever..I can read it over and over a hundred times more..It always has a freshness to it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addictive fun.  Can't stop playing. Missions make you want to accomplish more. Just one more run you'll keep telling youtself...
B008NIS2SS|1.0|I've been mowing through these Real Gone Jazz re-releases. Some are ok but this one is a disaster, starting with disc 1 where all the tracks on \\"New Jazz Conceptions\\" contain horrible digital clipping which sounds like electronic squeaks. Unbelievable that some reviewers here could say the audio quality is ok. It's not hard to detect!<br /><br />For further signs of shoddiness, note there are two tracks titled \\"Epilogue\\" on the album \\"Everybody Digs Bill Evans\\" and they sound totally different, in fact one is :40 while the other is :36 seconds long. Some Riverside bonus tracks are included while others are not, and predictably song titles contain errors, see \\"Peris Scope\\" instead of \\"Peri's Scope\\". Serious chop shop production here, full of digital clipping and not worth buying!
B00821OX98|5.0|The CG special effects are awesome. and one can really believe the actions and reactions of the characters portrayed. One of the best science fictions to come along in years.
B002ROKQJM|4.0|Civilization or decadence. As man progresses so the decay sets in, just like the black puddles and its stench pervades the gilts and glamour.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I only use the alarm but it is easy to use. I set it each night and it always wakes me. well worth the .99 for the app.
B007AL48UK|3.0|It crashes every once in awhile which is disconcerting. However I do enjoy playing the game. It can be addictive.
B004HWYTP4|1.0|Stupid, stupid stupid.<br />With Red II in the movie theater, I thought I would watch the first one and see if it was worth checking out the second.<br />NO thanks!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really love playing this game. I really feel as if I'm running a city. I would suggest playing this game to anyone.
0345522478|5.0|After reading all Jim Butcher's Dresden Files novels straight through, I was looking for something in the urban fantasy genre that would measure up in terms of storytelling and character development. After a few failed attempts with other writers, I found Hearn's Iron Druid series to be very commendable. I would recommend it to all Butcher's fans, as well as anyone interested in urban fantasy.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I thought the casting and acting was really good. The story was engaging even though the plot holes are huge (lots of poetic license given to the writer).
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|Wow, what a pleasant surprise this album is.  I have been a Spock's Beard fan from the beginning.  I have remained a fan through all of the lineup changes for better or for worse.  But....when I heard Nick D'virgillio was leaving the band I was worried.  Jimmy Keegan in the drum seat was not going to be a problem since he had already been the band's touring drummer for several years.  The vocal spot had me more concerned.  I was already familiar with Ted Leonard through his work with Enchant and had even had the chance to see him live once.  Although he has a great voice I always found Enchant's material to be rather generic in some ways and just was not sure how this was all going to work with The Beard.  I am happy to say that these guys have exceeded all of my expectations with this album.  Not only does Leonard fit in very nicely, but the material is still top notch and most importantly, the band still sound like Spock's Beard.  The combination of these musicians just have something that clicks and this album is a very strong one from them.  Every song on this one is a winner with \\"Hiding Out\\", \\"Afterthoughts\\", \\"Something Very Strange\\" and \\"Waiting For Me\\" standing out as highlights.  As usual the music is all top of the line and the band throw in their usual vocal and instrumental gymnastics all through the album similar to what they have been doing for years.  I honestly think this album ranks right up with the best in the band's catalogue.  If you were scared away from this one due to the personnel changes my advice is to give it a shot.  I think your ears will be rewarded.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|I ordered this item and am very happy with it the music is just as described by the seller i have been listening to it since i received.the order arrived on time in great condition as i was told it would be. i would strongly recommend buying from the this seller again based on the quality of music that i received at a value price.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|Sound Of Contact are a new progressive rock band led by Simon Collins, son of famous Genesis drummer Phil Collins.  Simon is also a drummer, so percussion is up front and in your face throughout this disc.  Assisting Mr. Collins are Dave Kerzner on keys, Kelly Nordstrom on guitars, Matt Dorsey on bass, Wells Cunningham on Cello, and Hannah Stobart on background vocals.  This is progressive rock as it should be, lush, imaginative, intricate, but with hooks that instantly stick in your head.  In a perfect world, the album's first single \\"Not Coming Down\\" would be all over radio.  It is a great little song.  I really dig this whole album and think that melodic progressive rock is not done much better.  I am not familiar with any of Simon Collins previous material and how it compares, but this is top notch stuff and for me so far in 2013, the album of the year.  I can't imagine that most people who enjoy really well done melodic progressive rock, with a commercial edge would not enjoy this album.

0064471837|5.0|The first two books in the Abhorsen lineup are a delight to read and Sabriel does not disappoint as the third book in the series. As the protagonist of the book, Sabriel is a breath of fresh air in a world of books that lack female characters with depth. Upon discovering her father is trapped somewhere in Death, she leave the comfort of her private school and ventures into a world she is unfamiliar with to find him. On her journey she meets Mogget, a powerful force trapped within the body of seemingly benign cat and Touchstone, a young man with a mysterious history.  Once you start reading, you cannot put this book down until you discover how Sabriel's journey concludes.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Just being able to find the entire collection in one spot is amazing. Now you can relive the exploits of Solid Snake from the MSX days to MSG 4. The only thing I wish is that they release the rest of the Big Boss story arc on its own Collection one day. If you are a trued Metal Gear fan, this Collection is perfect. Metal Gear, Solid Snake, MGS, MGS2, MGS3, and MGS4 as well as the graphic novels and VR Training missions. What more could you want?
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I never quite understood why my love tank felt so empty, nor did I understand why my wife's love tank was equally empty too!<br />We been speaking all the wrong languages of love in our relationship, and although our efforts have been done in the name of love and trust, we were being guided by what we wanted for ourselves instead of what we wanted for each other!<br />There are some other factors in our environment that also hinder us from truly speaking our respective languages of love, although these were not covered I would like to state that they have an intrinsic value to relationships and can get in the way of enlightenment of languages of love -(as they apply to my situation)- addictions, certain misconceptions arising from differing parental styles and long held self-worth issues and I'm sure there's many more!<br />Overall, a fantastic read, easy to identify with these concepts and a positive approach to conflict resolution. A must read for those in a relationship who want it to last and be happy in doing so!
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I ordered this from my kindle fire, only because it was the only thing close to the actual Candy Crush Sage game I could find that.  I have used it once.  If every other devise around can download Candy Crush Saga why am I unable to download it to my Facebook  and play from my Kindle Fire.  I play it through Facebook on my laptop, desktop and Droid phone but there is not a way to play it when I use Facebook on Kindle Fire....why if it can be played on the Nook, IPad etc. can't Kindle Fire handle it???

B009KS4XRO|4.0|Takes old fashioned BINGO to a whole new level of fun. App does not correct problems due to lock ups on the Daily Tournament. This is why I could not give 5 stars.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game is not only addicting but actually suspensefull you never know what is coming next I love it<br /> I cant stop playing. its how I relax after work great. game would recommend yo people. who like hidden object games with a twist
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|i watched this film twice because the premise is so beyond the main intellectually that it presents a challenge even to someone schooled in theology and familiar with other religions.  It is especially appealing to those whose avocations run to reading world history and a penchant for Jungian Psycology.  This is intense and has a flow which requires 100% attentiveness and concentration.  I was sure I missed the finer nuances of this film and therefore watched it again and glad I did!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game has wonderful graphics. Music too is pretty same as the movie. Game play quite smooth on my Galaxy Note 2. The game gets tough after a few stages and almost becomes unplayable. That should be looked into.
1904633420|3.0|When I bought this book I didn't expect it to be a collector's item. I expected it to be a fairly large sized book but instead it was pocket sized.

B003U51D58|5.0|Season 6 was amazing and not a dull moment.  The final episode was very touching and would find it hard for anyone to not feel moved after viewing it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|since the last update, the app will force close as soon as I open it. never had that problem before. love the game though, still give it five stars. just don't like this force close. if you could fix that problem I'd be happy. keep up the good work.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|One of the few albums that I can listen straight through without skipping any songs. Bruno Mars is definitely one of the greatest songwriters of this generation.
0786890932|5.0|This book has laughter at time, sadness at times, and a mixture of different emotions at other times. I loved it so much and was so eager to watch the movie to see if they are similar, yet the book was much better for the descriptive style it has. I remembered at times where I was reading it enjoying my coffee in a cafe and giggled, people thought I was crazy, that is because the book takes you to a different world where you do not think about who is around you.  It is one of the best novels I have ever read and enjoyed.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is one of the greatest songwriters of our generation. This album shows his versatility as a musician as well as a singer and songwriter. Another album that I can listen straight through without skipping any songs.

B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|The JJ Abrams reboot of Star Trek has been great to introduce people to Star Trek, but it has some gaps for the old school trekkies like myself. This movie attempts to mirror one of the greatest Star Trek movies of all time, and while fun and exciting it loses some of the human elements that made Wrath of Khan a classic. The performances are one again strong from the actors, but the comradery from the originals didn't translate. It came from the original actors playing the same characters not for years together but decades.  The movie is fun, nice to look at, and will get that little kid Star Trek excitement revved up. Remember that it is not \\"The Space Seed\\" or \\"Star Trek II\\", and enjoy it for the space adventure summer sci-fi movies feel. Just don't pick at the story because that would be a  disservice to a storied franchise that was resurrected by some really talented actors.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|The title of this album could have been 3 DOORS DOWN: THE GREATEST HIT, because to be honest outside of \\"KRYPTONITE\\" ( i thought the title of the song was SUPERMAN) i wasn't too familiar with the bands music.<br />However, needing some new music on the way to VEGAS to see DAUGHTRY and really because of that fact ( 3 DOORS DOWN has done some touring w/ DAUGHTRY and the singer has done some on-stage duets w/ DAUGHTRY that has really impressed me ) I purchased this CD along w/ some greatest hits compilations by CREED and WHITESNAKE.<br />I have hopes this will be a good road cruiser CD because the trip to VEGAS from Valencia, Ca is a long but tolerable haul with some good background music and my hot asian fiancee beside me.<br />3 DOORS DOWN:  Dont let me down!!!<br />DES

B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I thought this movie was ok, you really have to watch it you can't be doing other things. I thought they should have gone with the underground people more.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Warrior is an amazing movie. I have watched it twice now and still can't seem to get enough. Tom Hardy's performance is superb. He is mesmerizing. The intensity in which he plays his character is outstanding. The trials of this family are heart-wrenching and made me cry. The Warrior is intense--emotionally--the fighting scenes are crucial to the plot and are thrilling as well. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Great movie beautiful backdrop for the film as well in the French Rivera. Nice twist at the end as well.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|We liked this rental much more than we thought we would.  You know a movie is good when you'd watch it again...this one we'd watch again.
B00CMYRVAO|3.0|I like the Joe's older stuff. I would say that I only like about five of the songs on the CD.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I found this book to be a hard read.  His other two books I could not  put down.  This one I have to keep going back to.  I am still trying to figure out the purpose of this story.  It is disappointing.<br />I don't think I would recommend it.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Can't go wrong with a serial killer.  Great series, leading up to the final season.  Need the prior ones as well.

B00CISAPJS|5.0|Love this movie, all the wonderful animation and the stars....this movie will be watched many times over by e both of us.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great picture, sound and connectivity, already a big fan of this series, looking forward to the next two movies, enjoy
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It was a very good season, although I think I preferred more season 1 and 2, and the end of season 3, I was a bit disappointed
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|I have not opened this game as of yet. Not because I do not want to, but because I have not had the time to open and play with it yet.
B008F2AKUA|4.0|This is good music to listen to anytime.  It takes me back to a less complicated time and good memories.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I do private tutoring for Language Arts and one of my students downloaded this to my phone for me.<br />It is amazing !  We started using it right away and I wish I'd had it years ago.  It has made those<br />quick references, and need for help in pronunciation of words that even I don't know (!), so much faster<br />and reliable.

B0063M22QO|1.0|The game is too easy.  Was unable to find a way to change difficulty levels.  Don't waste your time or money.
B00AHTYI5M|1.0|Good god this movie is a mess. If this were a 45-minute short documentary on HBO or History Channel, then it would be interesting. As a movie, it came across as fake, boring and contrived. I was not too well aquatinted with the details of the actual events before seeing this and they seemed fake while watching it. After reading about what really happened, I am even more blown away that people fawn over this turd so much. Outside of Brian Cranston, the acting in this is terrible. Can we stop thinking Ben Crapfleck is good? He's C-Tates if Channing Tatum never grew as an actor. Easily the worst movie to win best picture since crash and there have been some clunkers.

B00B7Y0206|4.0|This YouTube app works for my Kindle Fire but, I don't like the ads pooping up on the screen every time for a few seconds.
0810989956|5.0|This is a nice adjunct to the series of books.  I had given my granddaughter the entire series of these books as she LOVES them and rereads them constantly.  This was given to her as a gift along with two of the series books and she loved it as well.  The book kind of guides kids along and gives them ideas of what they might want to put in their own personal diary.  Good idea to boost creative writing skills I suppose.
B000IZXR7U|4.0|if you like old school action movies or seen the movies road warrior and mad max beyond the thunder dome then get this movie cause this is the one that started the mad max trilogy and there maybe a new max mad movie coming out soon called (Fury Road) working title and this going to be a new person playing max the that played bane in dark knight rises i think but mel gibson will have a part in it playing as the drifter.
B0013ND30M|5.0|What can I say?  It's Disney, it's about Sleeping Beauty, it's a special edition.  One of my granddaughters loves Sleeping Beauty so of course she had to have this DVD as a Christmas present!  She loved it!  I have not had a chance to view it with her yet as they live in Japan, but they are coming home soon and I will be able to sit with her and view it.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|One of my granddaughters is a Snow White fan so I had to get her the original Disney Snow White of course.  She loves it!  What else can I say?  It's Disney, it's the 1937 original in beautiful quality, it's a special edition with extra content at a great price.  I have not been able to view it yet as they have been stationed in Japan for the last five years but they will be home soon and I will have a chance to sit and view it with my granddaughter and come back to edit my review then.

B00B6OEDS4|5.0|The entire CD is relaxing.  You don't want to fast forward any songs.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys mellow music. I look forward to their next CD and hope they are able to gain more exposure. I stumbled upon their sound on Late nightTV  programming.
1419705849|5.0|My nine year old granddaughter fell in love with the first book of this series.  I have so far purchased all of the seven books in the series and she ALWAYS has appreciated them and gushed to me about how much she loves these books.  She has read from the books to me over the phone (they have been stationed in Japan for the last five years) and I fail to see the appeal but if she is happy with them I will keep buying them.  She is a voracious reader but this series is what she continues to reread several times over so the writer must be doing something right for some kids.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I own a Kindle Fire HD 8.9, the game would freeze after the video when its loading . But after a while once you keep going on the game it works . Now back to the game review .... It runs very smooth and It has very nice flaws to it . In the store you can by little gadgets to help you in the game and upgrade them, but the best parts is the little characters you can buy so far i think there is like 8 and there very cute and cool . You can also challenge your friends from Facebook and send them taunts which is really . But like I said \\"ITS THE BEST MOBILE RUNNING GAME OUT THERE .\\" I recommend this to EVERYONE !

B006B7LQ90|5.0|I bought this book so I can learn a bit about positioning and I was very happy with it.  I learned more than a little; I feel I have a good grasp of how to use positioning in my company now.  Al Ries really understands this subject and knows how to get his points across.  It was powerful yet easy to read with great examples.  If you want to learn about positioning, buy this book.  You won't be disappointed!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I normally don't read war stories.  But I heard this book being reviewed on the radio and it sounded like a good humanizing viewpoint for both pilots (American and German) throughout World War II.  As it says, it is a true story.  And it will get your attention from the very beginning.  It is well researched by the author; I think it said it took him eight years to compile.  You will find yourself worrying about and sympathizing with and admiring both pilots.  You will learn more about both sides' views and circumstances they could not escape.  You will learn how their paths crossed.  When I read books like this I think back to history classes in school, and I wish more of the people stories had been told then too.  Too often when we do get the people stories, it is the notorious headlines we are fed--not the men and women who try to live up to a higher call like these pilots did while they had to serve their individual missions.  Sometimes I get lost in the middle of a book and put it down; I did not want to quit reading this book.

0807014273|5.0|I read this gem from the existentialist canon for the very first time seventeen years ago at the age of thirty-five. Naturally, I was deeply moved by Frankl's gut wrenching and heartbreaking personal account of the horrors of the Holocaust and of his heroic efforts to find freedom and dignity in the face of the most insidious and unfathomable evil, an evil so total that it sought and almost succeeded in destroying everything that he was, along with all hope for anything that he or the entire world might become.<br /><br />Being a sensitive and decent person, it felt sufficient at the time for me to deeply admire this special man, to pay my sincere respects to the millions of innocent victims of the Holocaust, and to be filled with profound gratitude for my own privileged existence. But, although I fully embraced these important lessons in resilience, humility, and gratitude, I was still too young to grasp the full import of the question that Frankl puts before us.  Allow me to explain...<br /><br />Seventeen years have since passed, and I have gone about the business of life with a mixed bag of successes and failures. In the meantime, Doctor Frankl's writing waited patiently on my bookshelf until the present day when, for some inexplicable reason, I felt compelled to read him again. Now, at the age of fifty-two, having survived my mid-life crisis, and with most of my years behind me (and now painfully aware of my own mortality), I came to realize the profound ignorance that engulfed me at the age of thirty-five. Enthralled with my own worldly ambitions, not yet having suffered my mid-life crisis, and assuming that most of my years were still ahead of me (and thus unconcerned with my own distant mortality), I was too ignorant to realize that I was chasing the wrong prizes.  The problem was that I was still pursuing happiness.  Only now do I realize that happiness alone is too narrow and shallow a pursuit (although it may be the occasional reward for doing my best). Only now do I realize that the real meaning of life is to live a life that has meaning.<br /><br />Man's Search for Meaning is essential reading for every serious student of life. It will inspire you to face the ultimate question with courage and without pretenses. Importantly, you will learn that the question that confronts us all is not \\"What is the meaning of life?\\"  Rather, the real question is: \\"What is the meaning of MY life, given MY unique endowment of blessings and burdens?\\"  No matter our individual circumstances, the meaning of our lives is an open question that is answered emphatically, for better or worse, with everything we do or fail to do each and every day. Furthermore, no one else can give you the answer, but... Read this book and you will find priceless insights into the true nature of life and the proper direction for your authentic inquiry into the question of meaning. In short, the only way to create meaning is through LOVE, sometimes in the face of horrific, unfathomable suffering.  The answer is that simple and that hard.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I enjoyed the book, it wasn't quite a linear story but the structure made sense at the end.  I have read other books such as &#34;From Jesus To Christ&#34; and this wasn't anywhere as dense as that - more readable in my mind.  If you have an open mind you will enjoy this book, and form your own conclusions.  If you have a closed mind, you'll simply cut and paste some screed here you were told to paste.  In the end, the author lets you form your own mind about things and not simply fall for the Big Church Production of Jesus.  I recommend it.
B004HD61KE|3.0|A very interesting premise, but too many cliff-hanger, last-minute saves-the-day situations. This seems to be Rollins's modus operandi, and I got tired of it after reading this and Black Order: A Sigma Force Novel. I think I'm done reading Rollins.

006224454X|5.0|Before I Go To Sleep is told in first person narration in the perspective of a middle-aged woman, named Christine, who had an accident many years ago (22 years ago, I believe) and since has not been able to hold onto her memory for more than one day.  She wakes up each day without any knowledge of where she is, how old she is, or what happened to her.  All she has is her husband to remind her of everything.<br /><br />I thought the story was very good.  The concept is similar to the movie, 50 First Dates, which is what initially caught my interest for this book.  However, it is nothing like that movie.  It is mysterious, suspenseful, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Seriously, I could not put it down for the last 100 pages.  I NEEDED to keep reading to find out what happened.  It seemed as though I was physically incapable of putting it down, because there were other things I had planned on doing with my time.  But, no dice.  I had to finish the book first!<br /><br />Everything about this book was very well-done.  The story was great and captivating.  The characters were well-developed and it was extremely easy to identify and connect with Christine all throughout her journey.  The writing was also very good, with excellent story-telling.  I was hooked from the first page.  I will definitely keep my eye out for more work from Watson!  I would highly recommend this book to fans of the genre.  I can't seem to find any faults with the novel at all.  Oh, plus it's turning into a movie starring Nicole Kidman -- reportedly to hit theatres next year!

B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Very average movie.  Not going to win any major awards, but was entertaining enough to keep me awake.  Barely worth the rental price.
B006RXQ3GO|1.0|Talk about corny and cliche! This movie was so predictable! I foreshadowed everything from beginning to end. Richard Gere's performance was stiff, good looks will not pull you through a movie. There was no presence to him besides the suits and smiles. Julia Roberts was okay and looked beautiful in anything she wore but she could of used a better co-star. I'm a sucker for romance and this was a complete waste of time and money! Thank god I didn't buy this on dvd! For the romantics out there, I recommend &#34;The Blue Lagoon&#34;. Breathtaking movie with every element you can ask for. I was in tears with the movie. It was played to perfection and is highly recommended!!! But if you feel as though you need to watch this for an American classic film, watch it and get it out of your system. Get it on instant watch for 3 dollars. Its cheap and you don't have to have it in your home.
B000NY12LO|4.0|extremely timely subject for our troubled times, with all the school shootings -- well thought out conclusions -- very entertaining
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Hours of fun and enjoyment. There is thought required to play and it is a great mind exercise. I would share this with friends.
0812973992|5.0|Everyone can learn something wonderful if one takes the time to read this wonderful book-young adults and old folks alike, there is something in this writing for all
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I'm 65 years old and have never read this book or Huckeberry Finn.  So, I've just read them both and I'm not sure that, as a kid, I would have enjoyed them very much.  Now, with so many life experiences, I could picture every event on every page.  Huck Finn was a little more difficult to read because of the way Mark Twain spelled the words to effect the southern speech in that era.  I enjoyed both books very, very much and I'm glad I decided to read them now.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I love star wars just like everyone else.  When i saw that seen at the end with darth vader saying nooooooooooooooo.,  It made me disappointed that they added that.  I dont know why they did that.  Since they put these movies on blu ray, they could have just made a direct cut version and an original version on the discs so it wouldn't make fans so mad.<br /><br />The blu ray picture quality looks great though and is enjoyable to watch.  I just had to cut down a star because of what they did to the movie.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Great characters with some real singing and dancing skills.<br />Funny cast that bring back our high school days, a blast to watch.
B00750WZNI|1.0|Sorry to write this review.  I thought it was for the service and product.<br />Book came in good time, just wasn't what I ordered.  I didn't expect to pay<br />$9.69 for a very used paperback.  Wanted a hardback copy for my library.<br /><br />Good news.  Amazon made it good.  Thanks for the refund.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Even though the plot was the most far fetched of any previous Grisham I have read, like a really bad Kidd or Westlake caper/heist novel, I still wanted to see if they pulled it off... guess the Boone series is where to find the only worthwhile lawyer books that Grisham still writes
B008Y6WMEY|2.0|I adore Peter Sellers, but this one left me scratching my head and unamused.  Just a strange movie and plot.  Back to the Pink Panther for me!
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|Great song [Rock 'n Roll]with words that bring back the 70's. Robert Plant at his peak on \\"Rock and Roll \\" along with a few of his others like Kashmir,etc. I  guess at that time he was always at his peak. No one has come close except Axl did for a while.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great app and nonstop addictive game its worth getting. i love to play this game anytime anywhere to relieve any stress after the day.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Finally a book that actually shows you how to achieve whatever you want.  It has terrific explanations and the writer, Pam Grout, writes like a real human with a great sense of humor...but the best thing is the exercises.  By mastering these pretty simply techniques you learn how to work with energy to achieve pretty much whatever you want to achieve.  I love this book.  Wish I had found it years ago.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is the best!!! lots of thing to do. love that it takes time and you can play for hours!!!!
B00BU18U82|3.0|This is a decent app.  I enjoyed it for a time although I found the controls for moving the machinery a bit cumbersome.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It won't let me login to Facebook so then I can't get any friends  but I still like this game I hope I can still login to Facebook cause I have a friend his high score is 241,967 I think but my high score is 319,694.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I love Tom Hanks but this movie was not for me.  Some may find it good but I didn't enjoy it.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I totally loved it!!!<br />Most of the actors spoke Bulgarian.<br /><br />The forest of Vitosha mountain.<br />Trees far apart, no bushes, no mosquitoes, no snakes.<br />Beautiful place to hike.<br /><br />The narrow cobble stone streets of the small villages.<br />The stone-wall fenced yards.<br />The old ox-driven carts.<br />And the old churches.<br /><br />And old Russian made trucks, airplanes, abandoned military bases...<br /><br />Yes, it is predictable.<br />Yes, it is stupid.<br />Yes, it is not serious.<br />Yes, impossible things happening. The good guys never get wounded, never run out of ammo.<br />SO WHAT???<br />This is an ACTION movie, i.e. a COMEDY. Just sit, relax enjoy.<br />Even the actors did not take themselves seriously,<br />\\"I am back\\", \\"I'll be back\\", \\"I work alone\\"... and other cliches.<br /><br />I wonder why Steven Seagal and Sean Connery are not in?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Lots of things happen, things change - it's a well done season and well worth your time.  Go for it!
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Loved Denzel and this movie was really good, with some good twists along the way and a surprised ending, would definitely watch again
B000007UXS|4.0|the bends separated radiohead in several ways. first it set them apart from their peers from a sheer performance level. the playing on this album is not just about power. it's controlled and delicate, explosive at times (not just the tired grunge, loud/quiet formula). the studio polish only adds to the atmospheric aura of this album which is a premonition of OK computer's darkness. secondly, it separated radiohead from itself, that is to say, from the pablo honey/creep syndrome and established the band among musicians. almost all the tracks are single worthy, and still somehow avoid cliche or commericalism. looking back in hindsight, this album is relatively straightforward guitar rock. however, for the guitar player this isn't such a bad thing. there are bands who maintain a formula and it works. radiohead could have followed this down a very successful path, even artistically. for now, we should be happy with albums such as these.
B0013ND30W|5.0|Bought the video for my granddaughter, kept the DVD and gave the Blu-Ray for her home, we've watched several times. Disney at it's best.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great show...the castle is just beautiful and the wardrobe stunning...last episode a real cliff hanger... Most anxious for the next season!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i do wish revival was cheaper other then that i love this game and so does my kids. It is worth playing this game.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Great book! Highly recommend it to any Rolling Stones fan. A good look behind the scenes. Couldn't put it down and I don't say that lightly!
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Great British crime drama.  I've only watched 2 episodes but the focus is very much on the psyches of the investigators.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I love the woven personal and history that makes up the story and includes bits of Israel and Jewish history.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|you will especially want to read  this if you saw the movie - or even if you didn't!!  A good read.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fantastic. Inside jokes and references galore. Great cast. Fresh chase scenes. clever dialogue. Go and see it! And then see red2, great sequel
B00633W614|5.0|I'm really into Jeffrey Archer's works now, reading every one I can get my hands on - and that is several.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|This is another winner for Jack Reacher,  I liked this one.  So far so good on the whole series.  I started with No 1 and up until 12 they were all good.  #12 was boring
B0018RFLQ2|4.0|What can I said the movie keep my attention I like it. Its touchy. How this kid got scare of somebody else without knowing his capabilities. It is really good.
B003WKOTXE|2.0|cute movie, interesting idea, good for moms, informative, well produced, but likely to put you to sleep before the end
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|The movie is OK in itself. I just love the music. If you like down home guitar playing this is a good example.<br />It also has the devil vs the good. I guess that was part of the plot.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|slow, childish, a waste of good actors. I kept fighting not to fall asleep, but lost the battle at the eand and couldn't bother to go back and finish it.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Considering how much money they spent making this movie and the fact that the first was so good, I am very disappointed in the dialog and what the movie was about. The special effects were very good however it was lacking in my opinion.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This was a good quick read to pass time. It starts off with a girl and her normal human life until she gets pulled into this mythical alternative world with demons, fairies, vampires, werewolves and shadowhunters. I like fantasy books and for the most part I really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />There were quite a few twists and turns to keep you interested. Some were pretty predictable and there was of course (tiny spoiler -->) a love triangle between Clary, Jace and Clary's best friend Simon. Throughout the book there were some predictable parts but it was good book with lots of interesting situations.<br /><br />The build up was good and I was getting really excited to read the ending. I even stayed up til 3am to read it but I was very disappointed in the ending. I expected better. The author probably made the ending the way she did so she could continue it in the following books of the series but I did hope for a better fight between good and evil.<br /><br />The twist at the end of the book also really dissatisfied me a lot. I was telling my friends of how great this book was until I got to this final twist. I really hope the movie doesn't add this part in.<br /><br />Otherwise the book was an excellent read overall but the ending was upsetting and I wish that one twist never occurred.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Wonderful film, best performance lately by Brad Pitt..feel like I know what a kind person he is.  Love learning about what a General Manager's job is and mostly love the realists relationship between Father and daughter and felt daughter expressed exactly what goes on in children of divorce in such a beautiful way
B000002O4S|5.0|It's a nice trip down memory lane, both for materialists who lived in the 1980s and baby-boomers who lived in the 1950s!<br /><br />If you want the complete Alan Silvestri score, it's also available here at Amazon from Intrada Records.  If you're only interested in the pop cover tracks, with a brief smattering of two tracks from Alan Silvestri, this CD will do just fine.  If funds permit, you can always collect both!
B0012GN0JE|3.0|I've been a die hard fan of Jeff Beck since the mid 60s. Think he's still amazing and a true original. I can still listen to some of his previous and more current material and enjoy them immensely. Flash, to me, is my least favorite. I liked it for about a month when I purchased it when it was released. Throughout the years, the sound has become quite dated with the echo synth drum for most of the songs. Jeff's guitar is crisp, precise and brilliant but that synth sound is too distracting. Flash shines in People Get Ready with Rod Stewart. This song hearkens back to one of Jeff's best- Truth. Aside from the synth sound, the vocals are dated as well- in the sense that it really sounds like a cheesy 80's record that everyone put out during this time period. For those that like that sound, you'll like this album which is accented with some great guitar.
B0007LXPBI|2.0|I have to admit a bias on my part; I love the original film and saw no need to make a DOA remake/update version of the same.  A version that fights to both separate itself from the original and mangle its memory with watered down versions of identical sequences/dialog.  This version is redundant and not a little cynical in its approach.  They manage to make the marriage between Quaid and Richardson just a silly shipboard romance that instantly falls apart resulting in a quickie divorce and the casual parceling out of their daughters (never intending for them to ever meet or realize the other existed).  But since they're both rich, they can do that with impunity.<br /><br />Most of the so-called `additions/improvements' to the story are handled in an energetic but preposterous fashion (such as the fencing match and the heavy furniture moved to a rooftop by a bunch of little girls).  It all feels highly manufactured just for effect.  They've also crammed the plot with too many pop references (that date this film immediately) and a ton of distracting musical selections.  What was once cute and charming is now cloying, forced, and obvious.  It plays like a bad case of one-upmanship.<br /><br />I'm tossing this one and sticking with the original.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This is such a breath of fresh air from the 'Boss'. And he proves he is the 'Boss' by taking chances. The melodies are new and different yet not too far to mislead Bruce fans. I didn't expect anything and I was simply blown away. Brilliant.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Given Stallone, Arnold, Dolph, and Van Damme (who's JCVD was incredible), I'm not that surprised.  Wish there would have been more Jet Li, though.  Statham was awesome, as usual.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|It is very small and cheap plastic. My granson of 12 let it sit for months before he put it together.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The author made me feel every emotion that Sky and Holder felt. Raw emotion...a connection that held me word after word after word.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This stupid thing never works it keeps saying that v tube is not working and when I am scrolling down it says loading and it never comes and when I press on a video it won't work it takes about an hour and it never comes anyway they better fix this app because I am hating it
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I always find this show entertaining and witty.  It seems to keep me laughing.  I can't seem to wait for the next episode.
0765348276|5.0|I ended up getting this book because when I finished Ender's Game everyone recommended it as a good \\"if you like that, read this\\" book. I was not disappointed in the least. This book flows and doesn't have any 'hang ups' that make you have to grit your teeth and trudge through like other books. I found myself reading and before I knew it 75 pages had flown by like nothing. I would highly recommend this book if you like SciFi in the mold of Armor or Starship Troopers.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|We Love the movie and my daughter is addicted to it! Now she can watch it anytime! We can watch it on the tv and on our kindle!
B007BVOEPI|1.0|I read George R. R. Martin's remarkable book and marveled over how an author can create an entirely different world with so much graphic detail.  Then I decided to watch HBOs film version of the book.  They decided their version should include an abundance of salacious material with graphic nudity and sex. This was highly offensive to me.  I will forego HBOs production and would not recommend it to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy this game because it is challenging. It makes you think logically and keeps the brain working. The levels do get more difficult as time goes on. Have fun
B005HED11Y|3.0|I love the series, but the show doesn't play smoothly. I used Netflix and it was fine. Amazon needs to improve their systems.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is so helpful. I love how it gives  an example of the word you are looking for. thanks guys....
B000PWQPAC|5.0|I collected Ghost in the Shell since the first movie. Right when I returned from Germany in the Army I started watching anime and got hooked on this one. The premise behind it Cyborgs HUB Cyber Brains the internet being a physical place you can upload too very cutting edge, perhaps you are just being guided by these words through the net, I'd be aware of this series if you know the deal about the Matrix.
0399157565|5.0|Haven't started this novel yet but I've read every novel Ms. Cornwell has written.  Highly recommend her work!  Well researched and brilliantly structured.
B0000549B0|5.0|My family and I really enjoy this movie.  I am so happy I finally purchased it.  I would recommend this to anyone you likes James Stewart
B009AMANBA|4.0|Historical characters are portrayed in human form.  well done and I must see this a few more times to truly ingest all that it brings.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|This is a movie that you have to watch a couple of times at least to get the plot.  It jumped all over back and forth in time and I had a hard time following it.  I did not have time to watch it a 2nd time.  The acting was good though.  Tom Hanks, as always came across as believable in all the different characters he played in this movie, which was what kept me watching.  I would watch it again.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Forget scientific accuracy.  this is one wild trip.  John Cusak is his usual ironic self. in my permanent library for sure
B00DYEN5QU|2.0|I was just as bored watching this movie as I was watching Superman Returns. The most intriguing part in the movie was that that was taken place in Krypton. How many times can we watch a building being blown up or falling down and call it exciting. I am for reboots but this one was written terribly. As a matter of fact since the story of Superman is so well nine and dear to all our hearts there should very minor changes (if any) to the original orgin, like Louis Lane knowing the real identity of Superman.<br /><br />But I guess whoever likes this movie just likes movies for explosions and not content.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is yet another movie that will be in my permanent collection.  These royal characters are so human and almost lovable - for obscenely wealthy and privileged people.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits gives you a real look into the high powered world of Law.  The characters are very believable and do a good job depicting the internal and external conflicts attorneys encounter. Suits is edgy, fun, innovative and a great watch.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|love these movies (even temple of doom). parts of crystal skull campy but that's part of it's charm. blu ray is a nice upgrade from the dvd and price I paid for box set was great. grand kids had never seen these before and now they are fans.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|I was looking for a boxed set of seasons 1-6 but it wasn't available yet.  If you enjoy the program as much as I have then this set is for you.  I love the closed captioning and I can finally pause the program to see the directors thoughts on the show, inspirations, and random bits of wisdom.  The show is well thought out and typically fits together like a jigsaw puzzle in the end without ever having to watch prior episodes.  Make no mistake if you don't have attention to subtle details you will miss the humor.  If you can pickup on other peoples quirks, idiosyncrasies, emotions, and thought processes then this show is for you.  If you can't, then you're like Sheldon Cooper in which case you should watch it anyway so you can see all the mistakes you could be making.
B000TEUSJK|5.0|This is a must have for Malcolm McDowell fans.  It's right up there with A clockwork Orange.  It was produced by Bob Guccione, the founder of Penthouse Magazine.  They created the XXX classification for this film.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I would recommend this cd for anyone old or young! I mean It's Daft Punk how could you possibly go wrong?
B00005V1WO|5.0|This is a great film to watch on a stormy night with your significant other.  It's a great fictional story involving true life, historical characters.  A must have for your Ken Russell collection.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show makes you want to be an attorney on Wall Street.  The actors do a great job in this series keeping drama and comedy balanced.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I first saw this in a hotel.  I selected it because it was the cheapest offering.  Boy, am I glad I did!!  It is SO funny and an excellent production!!  A GREAT mix of fiction and historical fact!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am hooked, well written and great performances by the entire cast. Every character is solid and watching as the years pass from season one to season three has been enjoyable to see how the world changed in that time period.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Excellent graphics and animation. Enjoyed this mystery very much. Did have to rely on the hint button  more than I wished to do, but did not take away from the game.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I also wish more game were like this. No fighting, but enough systems to keep you wanting more. I loved the ease of moving around, with the added hint if you need it.  Can't wait for #2!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app so much it is really cool! I already have minecraft for the Xbox and I personally think that it is a really cool game no matter how much people say otherwise. It is totally worth 7.99!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so fun I can play it any time I want and it doesn't shut off right when you get it
B004DN3VEM|5.0|I am a big fan of RAINBOW like i am with DEEP PURPLE<br />i already have the 1998 remaster of RISING but when i found out about this Deluxe edition i knew i had to buy it as soon as it was released<br />and it is the best version you'll ever get of this classic album just as Good as Deep purple's Machine head<br />it is a 2 Disc set<br />Disc 1 has both the New york mix and Los Angeles mix, the New York mix is from the 1998 remaster<br />so the bonus tracks are the Los Angeles mixes<br />i've listened to both mixes and both mixes sound very similar i think the only difference is tone and texture in the mix<br />but it's a matter of opinion<br /><br />Disc 2 has the rough mixes of all 6 tracks<br />in my opinion i prefer the rough mixes<br />the rough mixes sound like Demo tracks more raw sounding than the Polished remastered version<br />plus Ritchie Guitar solo's and Cozy powell Drums parts are different in these rough mixes, different Drum fills on each track compared to the final remastered version<br />slightly different Guitar solo's and Ronnie's singing is definitely different<br />there is also a 7th track LIVE rehearsal of Stargazer which sounds terrible, pretty bad recording like an audience recording.<br />not worth listening to cause of the bad quality<br />again it's a matter of opinion who listens to this Disc 2 you either Like the mix or hate it<br /><br />there's also a booklet with this 2 Disc set<br />the booklet tells the making of RISING very interesting reading<br />interviews with the Bass player and Ronnie James Dio talk about the making of the album<br />and also vintage liner notes of Cozy powell interview when he was alive<br />no Liner notes with Ritchie Blackmore<br /><br />so scrap the 1998 remaster and get this 2 Disc Deluxe edition, Definitely worth the money
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy the occasional banter as well as the challenge to offload the jewel of generosity!! May freeze from time to time but it is a freebie!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great game and helped a lot when on bed rest. It is so addicting! Well worth the money because so many games!!!
B004LP3AYI|1.0|I read the first book and was excited to continue the series. When I first came to purchase this Kindle book, there was a message on the page stating the content was wrong and it was being reviewed by the publisher. I waited for a few months for the book to be updated. When I checked last week, I was excited to see it was back up for sale - I had already purchased the audiobook and wanted the Kindle book for the Whispersync feature.<br /><br />When I began Chapter 16, I immediately felt like I was reading something that seemed like it should be located more near the end of the book than right in the middle. There was no precedent for the particular part of the storyline I was reading and it involved characters and actions that felt like spoliers to me. It was jarring. It was then that I realized, the book was never fixed. Needless to say, I returned it.<br /><br />Also, any attempt to contact the Publisher - listed as The FINE Group - was to no avail. There is no contact information listed for The FINE Group Publishing that I can find anywhere on the interwebulars. Boo.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|great idea to put on my kindles!! Nice to know I only need my kindle for a trip and do not need an alarm clock anymore
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I thought this was a good story. It flowed nicely, no noticeable mistakes or ill-thought transitions. The storyline was intriguing and left me curious to see what would happen next. For someone who's always been interested in the oddities of life, it's a very good read!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was highly recommended by a friend and it was fun and a blast to play.  I can not wait for new levels.<br /><br />HIGHLY Recommended.
0143113100|4.0|This book serves as a great introduction to neuroplasticity, a paradigm shift on neuroscience's thinking of what is possible in brain rehabilitation. As someone having been diagnosed with a chronic neurological condition for over a decade, it has always seemed interesting to me that the brain's own inherent plastic ability to change can give many people with neurological illnesses or injuries much hope.  My left leg has been weak and I suffer from foot drop whereby I literally cannot lift my foot up very much to clear it.  Without a brace to help me do so, I would likely trip and fall.  It is interesting to note that the more I used this brace, the weaker my dorsiflexion muscles remained.  So, I decided to wear it part time, during meetings at work or walks through the airport, for example.  What I noticed is that for shorter periods of time, in the beginning, I could walk without it.  Eventually, it the interval got longer without the brace, but I'm still reluctant to not use it everyday for fear of falling.  This book underscores a lot of my personal experience with this, but I wish that it delved a little deeper into motor plasticity instead of primarily sensory.  Yes, stroke victims can recover arm/hand movement, but how do you constrain a leg?  It's hard to do that with CI so I would be very interested to learn how this would improve my weaker left leg.  No longer being able to run, I have taken up cycling and it is easier to \\"unload\\" the stronger right leg and focus on pedal power with the left.  This also seems to have helped, along with balance.  So, the book is a great overview of the subject but leaves our some detail for brevity's sake.  It's already a long read.  But I wish there was more talk of specific research/application with Parkinson's, MS, ALS, etc.  These chronic conditions also exhibit inflammatory components that are longer term, as opposed to stroke.  It would be interesting to note these differences and I would welcome another volume describing the latest research with CI and those conditions.  But overall and excellent book that gives us hopeing the latest research with CI and those conditions.  But overall and excellent book that gives us hope

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Good historical reference to Jesus time and surroundings.  Whether you except Jesus as Christ or not, you have to admit that he has had a tremendous influence on the world.
0786955554|3.0|It's an alright enough set, I was expecting some better tiles, like small rooms and such, but for what it has, it gets the job done.

B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this bingo game and all the bingoblitz friends. You have lots of options. Love all the reward, free tournaments. What else can I say love this game.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|My friends and I were trying our best to outsmart him. Most of the time he wins or starts asking for details we just don't know. But it can cure a bit of boredom here and there.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This was a surprisingly great movie. It was excellent and is a worthy addition to the Wizard of Oz. I watched it and had a smile on my face the entire time. What an excellent movie! It was true to the source material while telling a different story, as this was a prequel to The Wizard of Oz. James Franco was surprisingly excellent as the somewhat smarmy showman Oz, and the way things worked out wit the Wicked Witch of the West was very well done. You can't go wrong with this one. It was well worth seeing for kids of all ages, including their mid 50's and later. 5 stars, and I'd give it 10 if I could. Well done Sam Raimi!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The only thing I didn't like is that after getting through half the game, they tell me to they will start tracking all possible star achievements. I really don't like going back to old levels so I pretty much ignored it and just played for 3 stars on each level.
1592332803|2.0|i dont care who or what gave it prizes and awards the amount of sugar called for in most recipes sounds awful and i would<br />not try them.<br />the photos are lovely, the directions seem clear, and the glossary helpful.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I especially like how you can choose to start from any level you have completed. This is nice if you want to start at a more difficult pace instead of starting back at level 1. You don't rack up as many points as if you would go the long hall form level 1 every time, but it makes quick games more fun.
0553382179|5.0|written with such warmth and caring for the reader, nicely organized, talks often of baby steps, starting slowly and being<br />consistent, which so many of us have trouble with and sabotages us quickly.<br />i found it motivating and supportive.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|I haven't tried multiplayer but against the AI is quite fun. My advice is to start easy because the harder the AI is set, the more upgrades it will have. You have to gain points by playing to be able to get upgrades. Anyway, nice game.
B004XZR63M|4.0|This is a terrific introduction to financial intelligence. Easy to read with many great anecdotes to bring home Robert Kiyosaki's lessons.
B00BNGFGIQ|2.0|But I felt like there wasn't really any skill involved and I was just flinging a monkey around. I lost interest pretty fast. It seemed pretty brainless to me and I tend to prefer at least a little strategy (I mean, even Angry Birds seems to require more strategy than this).
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|I don't quite get the popularity of this movie. I watched it primarily because I love Joss Whedon's Firefly. However, I'm not much of a Marvel fan. I thought the reason Avengers did so well is because it introduced the characters to audiences. However, Avengers doesn't do much in the way of setting up the characters. It's not really clear why or how these people became superheroes.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that much of the movie becomes a big CGI-fest. Aside from Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man, the other characters don't show much, well, character. The villain, Loki, is way too over the top. All he lacks is a black mustache he can twirl around.<br /><br />Instead, the movie really seems designed for people who have seen all of the other Marvel movies and want to see all of them together in one movie. It's not a horrible movie, but seems like really only for Marvel fans.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|The variety of puzzles was nice, but some were just harder than others. If anything needed to be changed, I think they should put harder puzzles in harder levels, rather than just increasing the amount of times you had to do the puzzle. Other than that, great game!
B000HKYA1I|1.0|This was for a school project and was not worth buying or seeing a second time.  I don't recommend it.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|Forgot how long ago this movie was made. Loved watching it again but this time with my granddaughter who was born 3 years after this was first shown. She is 13 now and loved it too. Good summer fun.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This is a differentiew of this series and is still action pack and full of fight and killing seens! In keeping with the history of the series and remembering to spread the wealth!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait until the new season.  I watched the three season's back to back.  So many twists and turns.  Fabulous characters that you will fall in love with. A must see!
B008YRTWM8|1.0|Did not order this item. Clicked on a review and AMAZON SCAMMED ME with a one click order. SCREW YOU AMAZON.
B008Y6RYDS|3.0|I've never been able to watch this whole movie from start to finish. It just isn't much of a story, the two &#34;heroes&#34; aren't really heroic, because they have no cause, no challenge. Their only challenge is to try to live free and be stoned, and the world won't allow them to do it.<br />Before you go there, I am very much a child of that era and the sound track is fantastic. That's what I watch the movie for from time to time.
0439023521|5.0|Collins pens a heart-pounding page turner with \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Set in the future, a war has changed the makeup of North America. Now called Panem, the area is spilt into 12 Districts and is governed by a capital in the former state of Colorado. Every year, to remind the districts they are the \\"losers\\" in the war, the Capital stages \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Districts select tributes to represent them. The tributes must kill each other in a game arena to win.<br /><br />When Katniss Everdeen's sister, Prim, is selected to represent District 12, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Along with Peeta Mellark, Katniss travels to the Capital. As she prepares to participate in the games, she realizes there is more to the games than skill. She must learn the art of subtlety and draw on all her wits to keep alive. Can Katniss win \\"The Hunger Games?\\"<br /><br />Collins' writing is crisp and sharp. She never lingers - the pacing is perfect. Her descriptions are just enough to paint vivid pictures in the reader's mind. Collins' creativity and imagination shine in this story as she gives us a dystopian look at the future, and while the future may look bleak, she also leaves us with a smidgen of hope.<br /><br />The best part of the novel is the journey Katniss makes. When the reader meets her, they learn she is physically strong, but it's the emotional journey that allows her to grow. Katniss' heart is as tough as nails, but to survive, she must show a tender side. She must demonstrate she cares for Peeta or she will lose. Can Katniss allow herself to explore the vulnerabilities of the human heart while playing the most dangerous game of her life?<br /><br />The book is mainstream fiction and appeals to readers 10 and up. The Hunger Games will keep you on the edge of your seat, anxious to find out what will happen next. I highly recommend this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted top pinterest! Now I  can pin on all my devices :) It is  much easier reading a recipe off the kindle where the screen is bigger than iphone
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Just getting to enjoy their music and my wife and I have enjoyed the concert over and over again.  The sound and the picture are great.
B004OEJMZM|5.0|Take a real example and explain it.<br />So I will suggest every software engineer should have this book.<br /><br />Or need take a look at it.
B001GJ3BPU|3.0|Come on Amazon you can do better than that ! The best part of this movie was the Jennifer Garner martial arts work out to Evanescence . The second best part was the Evanescence song at the funeral.I could have been a real fan of this movie, but they chinzted out on the special effects. After the original Spiderman, Daredevil looked cheap and fake. When it gets below $5.00 call me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|...but I really didn't.what a collection of twists & turns.makes me almost glad I'm not married anymore.Great plot & characters.
B00E8TVHBA|4.0|My daughter has watched this movie 6 times now. If you have a child that liked the High school musical movies, this is right up their alley. singing, dancing, boy meets girl stuff.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|This is a book that I took a long time to start reading. The first few pages initially turned me off when I read the sample. I finished some other books and came back to it and decided to finish the sample. At the end of the sample I decided it was worth purchasing. I am now on the third book in the series. This first book turned out to be much better than I thought it would be, but for me it was really by the second book that the series came alive. The character development is excellent. A lot of fantasy e-books nowadays have very one dimensional characters who are almost caricatures of the genre. However, Joe Abercrombie escapes this very well. It is interesting to see the characters develop and grow and I don't immediately know how it will turn out. Buy it!
B005544TRQ|4.0|What started out as a show about a whiz kid with a super memory has turned into a great show revolving around corporate tactics and subversion. The show has also given us one of the better modern characters in Harvey Specter. Don't expect all drama, however, as this has enough subtle jokes here and there to keep things light.
B005544V6A|5.0|I just started watching this series on Amazon Prime and my enjoyment of the series is greatly assisted by the fact that I don't have to pay per episode. Thus far, this appears to be a well written series. The characters are entertaining and, as a lawyer myself, it has what I call &#34;law light&#34;. Just enough law to be interesting without getting too technical. As is usually the case with legal dramas, they focus more on the high points rather than the nuts and bolts, which is perfectly understandable as, day to day, law is boring as hell. Worth watching.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|The effects are okay, but there's no way to save once you apply the effects.  I've tried various settings and working with other programs but no dice.  I eventually uninstalled this one.
B0016OLC5Q|3.0|Interesting story about a young man and the impact his childhood had on his life's choices. The movie was just OK.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|This game is pretty fun - the levels that allow you to play continuously let you get a good feel for the game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Different game for mobile devices. Well worth the $2 spent. Nice puzzle that takes a few hours to solve. Enjoy!
B005S9ELY4|3.0|There was a place where the video stopped, as if it was scratched, and it came at a important time in the movie. It did not last long, but , it made it a not so good experience.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Dude, it is very funny that my 57 years old father who lives in Turkey, called me that he heard the song and dancing on it :o)<br />I really obsessed with this talented girl and I think she is becoming bigger and bigger star that noone  can imagine. This song represents her artistic vision for the next step into music history.<br /><br />\\"The bigger the star, the bigger the target\\" - Michael Jackson<br /><br />Forget the charts, forget the media's scrutinize, JUST DANCE !
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Best uno so far I've played. I wish they allowed you to accumulate more points to play if you don't want to other than that is a pretty good game.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I think this app is nice but needs a few improvements<br />It gives what is says so it's fair enough
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This novel started slowly but eventually i was drawn in. As this is classified as a YA, I can only hope many young adults so choose to pick it up because it does make you stop and take stock of your present life and make you feel grateful to exist.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I would give UNO a 5 Star.  I purchased it for my granddaughters to play on my<br />Kindle when they stay overnight.<br /><br />Satisfied Nana
B003UBTX72|1.0|I found no literary merit to this narrative.  Others in my book club enjoyed the behind-the-scenes look at the music scene.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Sir Paul has done a great job on some very old songs and on his own. Valentine is superb. His fellow musicians that accompanied him really added to the quality of the album. There is a PBS special that features the making of the album that is really fun to watch.<br />I recommend this to all.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This was very easy to download and I like the easy access Icon on my kindle. I would recommend download
1451627289|5.0|I loved this book so much that I read it twice (and it is a long book.)  It is not only based on the premise of going back to prevent the assassination of JFK, but so much more.  What would happen if you went back and changed one thing - anything?  This book was compelling in many ways and left the reader with much to think about.  Pure genious, once again.
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|I think I like the movie because it is entertaining and the creatures look so real.  I wouldn't recommend for children who may be afraid of blood and who may have nightmares, but adults yes!
B001V7UXG2|4.0|A five star show with star removed because there are no subtitles!  They really limit their audience when they don't take care of older folks who have a hard time hearing.
B00D5CENXA|5.0|What a delight! This story is both moving and enlightening as it follows the tale of Annie as she struggles against her cruel husband George. Her friendship with Rob and her love of her horse, Czar help her to keep going even after George is imprisoned for beating her and causing her to lose her baby.<br />This book is well-written and the description and characters detailed and realistic. The tale carries the reader eagerly forward as you wait to see whether Annie will get the happy ending she deserves or not.<br />When her horse defends her against George, the detail is marvellous as the relationship between woman and beast is described so vividly.<br />Lovely!
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Let's just say it worth more than a dollar  It  has to be my best games  played out of all apps =-D it's so nice to punch a egg an become a gnome lamp this game excels in being random and a wild card is all you need to be cool these days.... it's just my vernacular... well not to give to much away but you can even level up and change skills Like Frank west in dead rising... lamp who doesn't love to punch bats an zombies?
B00280LYIC|5.0|My girlfriend told me the book was better than the movie, and I agree. I never understood why do many people disliked the movie and preferred the book but now I understand. So many scenes and twists that would've looked amazing on screen, the movie would've been 10x better
0375842209|5.0|This is one of those books that will stay with me for a long time.  The writing style was different than anything I have ever read. Thumps up for this one, and I can hardly wait to see the movie...
B00CATSONE|5.0|I have always admire the life of important people i histoty,but Tesla was always an enigma to me. Now I know more of his life and all is thanks to this wonderful book.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|There was much hype about this book, and the movie, I might add,  I thought it extremely long winded, same old stuff over and over, no real storyline, except zombies,  still unclear about how it all started, for that matter how it ended,  and really,  what did this guy do,  jump all over the world talking to people who survived the zombie war,  seriously???
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a good distraction for me<br />I'm enjoying this game<br />Very fun to play and can lose track of time
B005LAIIHG|4.0|An interesting piece of fiction with a good moral that appeared to slip in not by design of the director.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its very entertaining but only needs explosive tnt on creative, though i do spend like 20 % of my life on it
B008AX1HD8|4.0|I am still busy reading it, but so far I like it very much.  Jo Nesbo is my favourite writer at the moment.
B008NMT684|4.0|All I can say this if my son likes this, then I'm happy....  He utilizes this app quite frequently and gets super excited when he pieces them together...
0143113100|5.0|I am a recent graduate of a Master's Program in Counseling Psychology.  The subject of neuroplasticity became one of my favorites, and this book started it all.  It's still my favorite book on the subject.  Doidge manages to make the subject not only easy to read and accessible to almost anyone, but literally a page turner I couldn't put down.  I honestly believe everyone should read this book to open their minds to the possibilities of change and growth no matter who you are and what your situation is.  It has simply put - changed the way I look at my brain's capacity for changing and learning forever.
B00BZOD63S|4.0|It would have been better , if the ending was different really not sure what it meant and why the baby had to die . Then it come the question of why.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Works great! Downloaded to my kindle and the videos quality looks good. No complaints from me. Thanks for this app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this everyday , the BIG bold numbers are awesome. No glasses needed. I recommend this for every day math.
B00DH1G7DS|1.0|I'm not much on Sudoku but enjoy it occasionally. However, this game crashes every time I play it. Right in the middle, the game freezes and then I get a error message that the game is not responding and asks to close out. This is very frustrating and causes me to loose concentration on the game. I'm sure there's a more stable version out there. I would not recommend this game for anyone. Even as a casual player, the freezes are frustrating.
0345803493|3.0|Lacks the surprise and delight of the first in the trilogy -- of course, since we already know what's going on with these two.  Turns into a love story between two likeable young people, but not able to hold my attention the way the first book did!  Hardly the author's fault though, who could maintain that level of surprise for 3 books?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game has cute characters and fun challenges.  It requires good reflexes, constant attention and a sharp mind.  All around good fun.  The wrong move and splat!
B00BFIFIPS|3.0|The back scratches if the phone is set on any type of tile, cement or ceramic.  Average desktops wouldnt be a problem.
8866135909|5.0|I can't get enough of Moleskine. This is the third year in a row that i have used this planner and it is perfect for my planning needs! I can write my day to day plans on the left, and notes and ideas on the right &#34;notes&#34; section. Perfect for school as well.
B00005NWLO|4.0|I loved it when I was younger, and it is good enough (great, in fact) that I still like it today, somewhat!
140006922X|4.0|I dont know why some were upset at this book. There is nothing inflamatory in this book. It makes the case, like many other authors have, that Christianity as we know is based on Paul's teachings rather than Jesus'. I don't think even Christian scholars disagree with the idea of Paulian Theory.<br /><br />I wished that this book was longer. It felt like it was merely notes for a much longer book. I was hoping for a much more indepth look at Jesus' life. (Like the huge tome &#34;James the Brother of Jesus&#34;) But all in all it is a good, brief look at Jesus.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the first 3/4 of the book then the story got a little out of control.  Enjoyed the personal relationship analogies/descriptions.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Not just a great Star Trek movie, but a great movie overall.  I don't know how they're going to follow it up.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|The story line sucks you right in. I couldn't put it down.  I loved how the mystery was being solved with every new memory!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Perfectly written and portrayed for the modern-day man & family. Very touchy movie that hits the right spot. Really conveys the Christian message without compromise.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Something new and surprising on every page you never expect what's going to happen next!!!!!! I couldn't put this book down!!
B0084ANCBC|4.0|A wonderful look into life in a bygone era.  Once you get used to the writing style it is very enjoyable.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love the wonderful characters, the beautiful scenery and the great acting. One of my favorite series on TV. A feel good show.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|The write up was ok-ish. Mainly intended for Americans only. The build-up to the core of what is supposedly the theme of the love story failed. Hard to digest the feelings written without proper backup. All in all a timepass read as has to be a harlequin book.
B005544V6A|5.0|Rare to find a show that surprises you like Suits.<br /><br />The show constantly explores all the elements that make the various interpretations of law so interesting.  While many similar shows focus on one super genius or two rival super genius, it's fun to see a genius mentoring his protegee.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Loved the first movie, and this one aswell. The Saints are back and still kicking butt!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the first movie.
B005ERYEGU|5.0|Ross's key concept -- that salespeoples' time is too valuable to spend on prospecting -- is a terrific insight. Lots of companies see lead-gen programs as a necessary evil that they've been forced into because &#34;real&#34; salespeople hate to prospect. It may be that salespeople hate prospecting because they know it's wasting their time (and for commissioned reps, that's money out of their pockets). The trick, of course, is how to build a sales machine that can find and qualify enough leads to feed the sales force, year in and year out. Judging from the success of salesforce.com Ross seems to have figured it out.<br /><br />Michael Boyette<br />Editor in Chief, Top Sales Dog<br />rapidlearninginstitute.com/top-sales-dog‎
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Man oh man this book was very compelling...looking at others a little differently at the moment, the power of some people's minds!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The book gives an excellent insight into the cultural and historical context in which Jesus lead his transforming ministry. As a Christian, I didn't find the book offensive, I found it to be quite informative and historically acurate.
B000MAOLVW|4.0|The video is excellent - clear, crisp no artifacts.<br />The cast and the acting is professional - unlike the stuff that's put out nowadays.<br />The film on racing is better than anything else I have seen on racing.<br /><br />Excellent value.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Good way to relieve stress with mega minion crush all those you work with or those who just bug you.
B0053O89WY|5.0|is how I watched every single episode. I have been a fan of this show from the beginning and it does not dissappoint.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book weaves a family history that is very touching in its parallelisms. The author's storytelling skills are excellent. The images and emotions that he evokes are rich and very human.
1401323820|5.0|Just a great book! Kept me interested from the beginning and it was great reading couldn't put it done, just love this type of writing.
B003G4W49C|4.0|First do not read the introduction! The writer has an obsession to explain to you why and what he wrote before you actually read the book and try to figure it out for yourself. Then the story is well written, although the child soldier plot is not at all original. Then the whole story is ruined by the ending attached decades after the original strory is written in order to make it possible to write the hilariously bad sequels.
B00013RC8O|5.0|great 70's movie! Just can't beat the challenger....awesome!<br /><br />One of my favorite car movies....along with the original Gone in 60 Seconds.
B005IYNQAY|2.0|It is in no way a continuation of Ender's game. The writed had to attach a really bad ending to the first book to have an excuse to write this rubbish. At least it has a story, but it fails to end, it is just a big cliffhanger, and not a very good one.
B0054W4JQK|3.0|This book was ok, but it was a little like ground hog day.  I thought it was a thriller, based on a review I had read, but it wasn't at all.
0307586901|5.0|The book was new and had many craft ideas I think I will use. Pictures of crafts were great and instructions were easy to follow.
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It wasn't the usual boy meets girl and falls in love story.  There was a little more of real life in it which is great.
B005544TRQ|5.0|somehow they manage to put a new twist on the whole lawyer series thing. Keeps my attention. never a dull moment.
B006UIUJ2A|2.0|We chose this book as our first book club read and we couldn't have started with a more difficult book.  We had mixed reactions, mostly bad.  Most of the club hadn't even finished reading it.  In my opinion, the book jumped around a lot and I struggled to keep up with the main character.  The best part was the personality of the main character.  I actually liked him.  But, I don't think this is a Pulitzer Price Winning book.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love reading this book for many reasons. Here are just a few: The author's story grabbed my attention at the beginning. Even tho I've been following the series on HBO, there are exciting plots and sub-plots  where descriptive writing vividly color the charactors and the landscape. It's amazing to me that an author can write voluminously, and keep the readers' (this reader's) attention chosing such interesting content.<br /><br />The writer, the book; both excels.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I now know why Downton Abbey is so popular and highly recommend it.  The actors are well chosen, scenery is pretty and the series is classy and well done.  I cannot wait to see Season 4!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good twist at end of book. Was fairly predictable like a typical sparks' novel, but the end made the read worth the time.
0689835604|4.0|Illustrations are adorable, but the flaps are a little flimsy.  Won't allow my 15 mo old grandson to pull on them yet.  He would tear the flaps off easily.
B000LJB9U0|5.0|Natalie Wood's last movie before her tragic death.  Have not seen it in 25 years and it still has power from a strong cast.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Jeremy Irons rocks as the consumate wolf in sheep's clothing! Not for kids but adults will enjoy the show- highly recommend.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another triumph of childhood over and across generations. While set in Afghanistan the anguish triumph of family could be found in any culture or country and across socio-economic boundaries. Thoroughly heard tugging and thought provoking. A must read
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was good, but I liked Hunger Games better. I wonder how the next book will pan out. We shall see.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|the game was like ok great fun and whatever...................The whole game warms the old thinking muscle. lol...<br /><br />The family will enjoy this game
1490313370|5.0|This book was purchased due to motivation from the author's blog, which has a style of its own. I admire the author's candor, although his wording, on occasion can be somewhat vulgar and may be offensive for some and detract from the candid and helpful insights based on his experience. With the title &#34;Choose Yourself&#34; the book promotes self reflection in that the author encourages the reader to ask of her/him self, who and what is &#34;Yourself&#34;? Are we being authentic and forthright in our interactions with others? This requires each one of us be have the courage to reflect and discover what it is to be authentic and to then be authentic, as opposed to replying in the ways that convention requires. I love this book because it has prompted me to struggle with what it means to be &#34;authentic&#34; and to risk the responses to experimenting with this development. There is humor, along with wisdom in the author's writing. It's an easy, enjoyable, thought provoking book which I would recommend with the caution regarding the occasional use of &#34;base&#34; language.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game .It is easy to play and fast paced! I love getting all the new animals and building heir families;)

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|DragonVale is a great app and I highly recommend it.It's appropriate for all ages and very fun to play with.I've got a seasonal dragon already;)!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I can't remember when I've last  enjoyed a novel so much. Don's struggles to negotiate conventional social skills are never played for laughs at his expense, and his growing attachment to the Rosie Project is a delight from start to finish. The characters are well written and the dialogue is excellent. Parochially, I loved reading a screwball comedy set in my own city.<br /><br />It is extremely well written and displays great empathy for all the characters. There is romance aplenty, but no bodice ripping, which I for one find a relief. One can have too much I formation too much of the time. I so enjoyed Don and Rosie's adventures and Daphne was right. don't good husband material.
B00640UICA|5.0|Yes This Is One Of The Best Games From ALL Amazon!!!!!!! Trust Me Download It This Game Is Really Fun!!!!!!! This Game Is A Beast You I'll Never Find A Game Like This!!!!!!! Ohhhh And Keep Rating 5 Stars For The Game Keep Updating!!!! ;)

1904994679|5.0|Perfect gift for the kid who loves crazy facts!  My son loves reading all the records that have been broken!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This night light really gives a lot of illumination to our hallway, where there is no outlet for a conventional night light.. The sensor picks us up as we turn the corner and makes the trip down the hall far safer. Woke up last night to find the cat sitting in front of it staring at it. Wonder how long the batteries will last if she keeps that up?!
B004TE6F66|5.0|This book is so interesting I loved this series kept me entertained through the end only wish there were more than 3 books!!! loved it
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|The game itself works very well, however, there are a few annoying issues. First, I hate when an app forces you to rate it with annoying pop ups that you can't decline. Then there is a button to see your scores that doesn't work.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I PURCHASED FOR MY USE. I USE IT TO LISTEN TO THE TELEVISION SINCE I AM NEAR THE POOL IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN THE VOLUME IS UP TO 50. WITH THIS HEADPHONE IT HELPS BLOCK OUT THE NOISE IT IS ALMOST LIKE BEING IN A MOVIE THEATER.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I went to the end... but often it was slow going. I thought it needed editing so it would stop being so it wouldn't be repetitive. The book is worth the read if like  this kind of book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this app very much! My husband an I decided to make this a race to see who would finish first. :)
B000TENKEK|5.0|Great album!!!  The bass alone is worth the price.  This is my first Gorillaz album, and I will look into getting more
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I am aware of great manipulation in our Holy Book.  I revere the idea of the spiritual thread that does sew itself throughout the Bible and feel able, at this stage of my life, to look at tales and stories as spiritual guidance.  I can<br />sweepingly delete so many of the Old Testament stories about a jealous and angry God , who slew at will.  The higher power we call God is surviving even as we put together the history of Jesus and other people of his time. This book helps us  become aware, about what probably went on in his day and will make us ponder all that religious organizations have touted as absolute truth.  As a child,<br />I was taught that every single word of the Bible was literally true.  Excellent and honest book in my opinion.  Mary Jane Lane
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|Fortunately I didn't buy this book. I got it from the library. Because of all the great reviews, I decided to read it all the way through until the end, even though I kept finding serious flaws with it. The main character, Clary, is an absolute idiot. I hate it when a book relies on characters being stupid to further the plot. And for some reason the incest really bothered me. It didn't bother me in Star Wars at all, because the story was well done. But at the end of this book I felt incredibly yukked out. I can't understand why so many people liked this book. BTW, I've read and enjoyed several YA urban fantasy series (Harry Potter, the Hunger Games,Twilight) and several adult series (Dresden files, Mercy Thompson series). This book, however, was complete rubbish.
B00CJ32S74|5.0|This album is great. The awesome combination of artists and the meshing of music styles is phenomenal. A great soundtrack for a stunning film. Baz has done it again.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Once again G Martin has outdone himself! I am chomping at the bit for his next book, which I plan on downloading immediately and immersing myself in entirely.
0425266060|5.0|The Crossfire trilogy is off the chain. Mrs. Day I must say you have trully out done yourself on this one.  I can't wait for you to take me out of my misery and pen the the next book must read what happens next please don't take to long.  Simply going out of my mind with anticipation....
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|This is a really great movie if you like love stories. I would definately watch it again. The actors have great chemistry together!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Amazing game I recommend it to others. Great graphics, very easy to follow the story line. I give it two thumbs up for anyone who likes puzzles.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This item worked out of the box.  I have had it for almost 2 months now.  It coordinates with 3 different phones and is very easy to use.  The sound is clear, (you may have to turn the radio down).  It can be recharged in the home or car with the supplied adapters. It does have a really good range.  Remember to turn it off when you leave your car.
8862931921|5.0|I never had a moleskin notebook before because it was too pricey here in the Philippines, good thing I have several options to ship it here in the Philippines and was able to purchase an A4 size for the 1/3-1/4 the price here. Best sketchbook that I've ever had!
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|My title says it all. I cannot get enough of the CD! Joe has always produced good music and he definitely does not disappoint this time around. I love when i purchase music and can listen to the entire CD without skipping a song!
B008XCJ03K|5.0|This album is absolutely phenomenal. It's even better when you hear these songs played live.<br /><br />If you like a folk/indie mix for music, you should enjoy this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is the best game in the world. this game is never ending. u can play till u die I cant stop thinking about it
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I feel like this was a wussy ending to the trilogy. It started out well and good but by the time it ended, it flatlined. Way too many questions at the end. It wasn't really an ending. I really liked the series and the concept but the finale just didn't do anything for me. I was disappointed. I have great admiration and respect for authors and their ideas and I understand how hard it is to write a book or multiple books and especially a finale to a series. But Requiem didn't tie up the series in a nice little bow which is what I look for in a final installment book. Delirium was such a great start. And the love triangle with no end? *sigh*
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Bought this while away from home. It came with an instant download from Amazon and I didn't have to wait for it! Awesome!
B00BEEKN26|5.0|Fast shipping excellent product
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My friend told me this was additive and boy was she right. I've got it on 2 different items { phone & kindle fire }
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device works fine, it will be better when there are more apps. The netflix code did not work, not sure what to do about that.
B007EDYN36|5.0|I liked the history about Peter's childhood that developed his personality aa a person, good insight. Good stories about their heyday as Kiss and how he took responsibility about his drug and alcohol abuse. Amazing how you can be  taken advantage of multiple times over the same things.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|absolutely beautifully written - he just keeps getting better and better with each book. I've read them all and I'll certainly read the next one.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|I quite liked this.  Stories of this nature can be hard to watch, and it was, but the historical realities that make it difficult are exactly why it is worth it.  I thought this was well delivered.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show.  Looking forward to next season! Great cliffhanger this season with Matthew dying.  Can't wait to see where the story goes.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I haven't listened to QR since Empire.  This felt right at home to me, I was very impressed with the new vocalist and his ability to deliver the QR sound.  It almost never happens that a band can be reborn and be just as good (Pink Floyd is the only other one I can think of that pulled it off).
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|Record was in great condition as it arrived.<br />It arrived on time.<br />I like the band very much and the new recording is great.
0307477479|5.0|There were so many things I loved about this novel (if you can truly call it a novel; it seems so much more), but perhaps most startling and beautiful is how Egan manages to tie together these multifaceted stories--all of which combine to question what remains in the wake of punk music. Each of these characters is battling off their own desperation when faced with the chaos of life in a world where the simultaneously destructive and romantic allure of punk is no longer alive. However, I think that Egan uses punk music merely as a lens in this novel--a lens to try to understand aging and memory.<br /><br />Successful literary fiction asks difficult and disturbing (in the best sense of the word) questions. This novel most certainly does that.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|This has a lot of regional hits from the late sixties like &#34;It's Cold Outside&#34; and &#34;Time Won't Let Me&#34; from Cleveland.  Over a hundred songs on the four disc collection, more than half of which are keepers for your iPod.
B0080K3RGQ|5.0|Fantastic recipes from one of my favorite chefs! I now own all three Ottolenghi books (The Cookbook, Plenty and Jerusalem), and I just can't stop cooking! Love the food, love the flavors - Mr. Ottolenghi's a genius!
B0064NTZJO|4.0|good movie, but two driving scenes was disappoiting. (also not passing anybody in the first driving seen when on the bridge despit three gear changes with presumably the throttle nailed...hmm. and since when does a chevy impala, chevy mustang, and a chrysler 300 all sound the same at high rpm? ). The second half is about as gritty as it gets for mainstream too. Worth the money and time.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a good book, I really enjoyed. My book club decided to read.  I did hear a few complaints about it being a downer.  I wish she was a bit more of a heroine, and not just some frail leading lady. I expected her to pull out some sneaky, witty moves to undermine her horrible husband, but that didn't happen.  However, overall I liked the book a lot.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Great show family friendly and uses some real science. Sci-Fi I refuse to call them SyFy ( because it is silly ) bring this show back or make a feature film.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This app is Amazing!!!!!! I absolutely love it!! I mean have u guys seen the graphics so it an amazing and if u play it I know ull LOVE it<br /><br />  -JH
B007N85POS|5.0|Lot's of fun, there are challenges to get the golden egg and other bonus points. It is more difficult than I thought
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie is so exciting, and the best movie that I have every seen. Please but it worth the money
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The only problem with this is how addicting it is! Have it on my phone and kindle! I love it!
B004AKCME8|5.0|This was a very very good movie. I will watch it over and over. Thanks for the great<br /> entertainment. Sincerely Connie
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great Series!  Right up there with the best Sci-Fi shows ever!!  A shame there is only one season....follow up Movie...Serenity...is great and wraps up the series famously.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Terrific writing, compelling characters and interesting story lines.  Will keep you turning pages late into the night. Sorry to see it end.
0143119680|5.0|Excellent first novel a little hard getting into at first but then it grabs you and spell binds you and never let's go
B009LDCZ7I|1.0|Season 1 was okay, but 2 was terrible.<br />the quality has gone down so badly that I felt i was wasting time watching the season.<br />The plots were unrealistic.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />One scene i remember is that Brody goes to a police station to report an accident, then the crazy woman didn't let him and he freaks out and almost blows his cover and everything.<br />I was like \\"what the,,,\\"<br />A terrorist who almost blows the vice president into pieces completely freaks out just because he cannot report to the police and the daughter gets mad. Yeah right,,,<br />Also, Abu Nazir comes to the States and dies for nothing. If his death were the key, he could have just died in Iran or wherever. Why does he make such a hustle? It is simply stupid if you think about it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|With the Kindle Fire HD I have been frustrated when I cannot view things the same as I can on my lap top. This app works perfectly well and I'm happy with it. I have personally not found anything to dislike about it. It does what it says, plays YouTube!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great for keeping your mind active and fun as well.<br />Takes your mind off other problems and let's you enjoy.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Great product, love all the extras it came with like the screen protector and cloth! Very slim and doesn't weigh the phone down, but still provides great protection!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product....<br />Free Netflix  3 months is great...<br />Works great with YouTube , Netflix and chrome even local files work great....<br />Thanx google...
B00006AG5N|5.0|Granddaughter loves Elvis so was very happy with this one.<br />Never thought would have granddaughter that likes Elvis as much as I did.<br />Great buy.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|If you don't know Temple Grandin, then you need to, not just austic people, but everyone can learn from this film.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Ten & eleven year old granddaughters love Taylor & I feel she is a good role model so had no problem getting this one for them.<br />They know every song by heart & even have different dance moves for each song.<br />Highly recommend.
8866137480|5.0|Love the item! It is perfect with a day for each week and a notes section on the side. Also love that it is 18 months long.
B006BQNJR8|2.0|It wasn't all that good with Arny, but at least it had Arny. This has nothing going for it at all.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I've loved every Lee Child book I've read and this was one of the most involved.  I thought it was great and would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense and a lot of action.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I don't have to \\"look inside\\" a Follet novel. If it's by Ken Follet, I'll buy it...and enjoy every single page. \\"Winter of the World\\" was wonderful. Big, Bold Book with plenty of pages to really get to know the characters. Many were the children of those characters that populated Book One. His research is impeccalbe as he places his characters in the middle of all the turmoil of the WWII era. Eagerly looking forward to Book Three! Patricia Reiss Brooks[[ASIN:B00EAPVI2K Blood Hoax]]
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the ending<br />It is really good if and xbox and co  co  co  and she's snacks nd b.s.

B007D2XSW0|4.0|Lots of options, very easy to use.  They only problem is it doesn't quite format to the GS4 screen properly... some of the menu options are partially hidden while in portrait mode.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love love love it.  interesting characters and interesting storyline keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat at times
B005ES0ZDU|5.0|These Crocs may not win fashion awards but for those of us utilitarians, they are one of the best slip on shoes available. They are extremely comfortable and this 'Duet' model features a tougher bottom sole which makes them much longer lasting. They are also impervious to water, mold, sweat etc. Good product.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Loved the story line! Good job by the young boys acting as well. Not sure what their names are but great to watch!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|this is a very cute movie and one of my daughters favorites.  glad i found it on Amazon around the holidays for $5.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a good and fun app I would suggest you get it and anybody can play it doesn't matter what age
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Fun and at times a challenge. Great to play waiting for the doctor or at the airport. Good games for kids, too.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|This isn't an album full of singles.  So if you're looking for some top 40 track that you can play over and over again, you'll need to look elsewhere.  This is nothing like anything in the mainstream.  This is nothing like Pantera or any other iconic album.  This is hard-hitting, in-your-face, raw expression of aggression that's meant to be enjoyed as an entire album, not one song at a time.<br /><br />It seems like the songs change momentum pretty frequently and it sounds like there's a lot of \\"fills\\" throughout the album, but it actually makes a hell of a lot of sense after you listen through its entirety a few times.  People want to critique this and that, but it's exactly as it should be -- NOT F***ING MAINSTREAM.<br /><br />Thanks, Phil! \m/
1452115567|5.0|This is the cutest little coffee table book. I actually went to meet Maddie and her owner, Theron. There is a cute, yet meaningful short story in the beginning. Plus, you can continue to follow Maddie on a blog!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Written to allow faith ... awesome book.  I would recommend this book to anyone of any faith, thank you Reza.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed this game...would like many more levels...was done in a day....hope it doesn't,take too long for the new levels to come out
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Liked it, just wish it was longer. Actually posed some challenge. But still possible without having to cheat if you are willing to think. I liked the different idea of having to solve problems rather than just having to hunt and find by guessing and trial and error like most other escape games. Nice variation.
B005UG542S|3.0|The eagerly anticipated ending of the Harry Potter series falls a little flat due to Radcliffe's titular character's inability to articulate his own motivations for engaging in this epic struggle between good and evil.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like the game but it's very hard to win unless u spend money.  and that can make it a very costly having to buy bobbles and help.  Don't think I'll be playing it much longer because of that That's why I couldn't give it 5 stars
B004WMKSH2|3.0|This first part of the finale is shot with great attention to atmospherics but Daniel Radcliffe's character struggles to invest his character with a motivation of any sort, leaving a sadly one-dimensional character in a vivid world.
B0012IWHDW|4.0|This is the sound track for the movie of the same name starring Kris Kristoferson, Rita Coolidge, Slim Pickens and, of course, Mr. D. himself. All of the music is instrumental, except for \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" and the two and a half versions of \\"Billy.\\" Personally I love the instrumental stuff, but if you don't, you can get \\"Heaven's Door,\\" on a lot of compilations, but without this record, you'll miss out on \\"Billy.\\" Four stars for this one, even though \\"Turkey Chase,\\" is a hoot and the beautiful and haunting \\"Final Theme\\" will chill your soul.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|This is an amazing book. The writing style is fantastic. The book is entertaining, deep, and overall an awesome read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone!
B005F9TQ4C|4.0|My dad told me he didn't like \\"Street Legal\\" when it first came out. It was one thing for Mr. D to be sharing vocals with Ronnie Blakely on \\"Hurricane,\\" or Emmy Lou on the rest of the \\"Desire\\" LP, but he didn't like the gospel like female back up on \\"Street Legal\\" at all, said those girls \\"Got in the way of the songs.\\"<br /><br />Being a girl, I just naturally disagreed with him, but secretly I had to admit, they were pretty irritating. Even after years of listening to this, those singers still put me off and that's a shame, cuz there are some great songs on this record. \\"Senior (Tales of Yankee Power),\\" \\"True Love Tends to Forget,\\" and \\"Baby Stop Crying,\\" all would have been classics in my opinion if the Dylan from another of the Dylan periods would have recorded them. Ah well, four stars.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Best game ever couldn't stop playing so fun I played for hours I need to take a break fun fun fun fun fun fun fun finest game ever<br /><br />g
B005F9TQ2Y|5.0|Nineteen Eighty Three marked Mr. D's return to real rock and roll. Ex Stone guitarist Mick Taylor rocks on these tracks. This CD is one of Dylan's best albums and a refreshing breath of air for many after the few that came before. \\"Jokerman\\" is s long song full of images too numerous to mention, reminiscent of \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" three, four or more mental pictures with every line. \\"Sweetheart Like You,\\" and \\"Don't Fall Apart on Me tonight,\\" evoke both love and anguish the way only Dylan can.<br /><br />My dad used to play this one all the time, claiming that next to \\"Blood on the Track,\\" it's Dylan's best work. I don't know if I'd agree about that, cuz there are a lot of others that I really love, however I do love this one too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Took me to another unknown world.  It was filled with love, passion, and tenderness. Loved the characters with all their flaws-very human and believable.<br />I give this book 50 stars!!!
B001NERPHS|5.0|Actually recorded in 1967 but not released until 1975. The Basement tapes had been around for years before they came out, bootlegged time and time again. This CD is pretty much about good time Rock and Roll, a fun album to listen to. There are serious songs here however, like \\"Tears of Rage.\\"<br /><br />Though not in my top five Dylan faves, this is a record that I go back to again and again, in fact it's one of the first CDs I ripped into my iPod. Dylan's voice is so pure on these songs, a precursor to the way he uses it on \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\"
B00026WU64|5.0|This is Bob Dylan's second album, a folk record of some of the best songs he's ever done, and he was so young. While his first was an album of mostly folk song covers with only two originals, this record had only two covers, the rest being originals and some of Bob Dylan's finest work. \\"Girl From the North Country\\" is one of my favorite songs, by anybody, and to think it was written by a twenty-one-year-old kid, almost half a century ago, way back in 1963.<br /><br />\\"Master's of War\\" still seems valid today. Re, those masters of war, those seller's of guns, \\"There is one thing I know, though I'm younger than you, that even Jesus would never forgive what you do.\\" Yet, despite those words that moved so many, all these years later the masters of war are still plying their trade. \\"Masters of War,\\" is a song as timely now as it was way back in 1963 and a song Dylan has revisited time and again throughout his career.<br /><br />On this CD you'll find \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" is on this album as well. It's my personal favorite, especially the way he performed it during the Concert for Bangla Desh with George Harrison at Madison Square Garden in 1971. If that isn't enough, Dylan performs the sweetest version of \\"Corina, Corina\\" you'll ever hear. And, of course, I have to mention, \\"Blowing in the Wind,\\" perhaps the greatest protest song ever written. This CD is one you must own.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The only reason I gave this a four star rating was because to play you need some tokens well when u have a scratch off the most u can win is 5 tokens which isn't enough. So that is my main reason I gave it a 4 star.....
B0000C8AW7|5.0|I've heard it said that Bob Dylan said of this record that it's like \\"a greatest hits without the hits.\\" Well, when you listen to this masterpiece, that's exactly the kind of feel you get for this album. It's like each of the songs is an old friend, like we've heard them all before. How did Dylan do that? Maybe it's because he recorded \\"Love and Theft\\" with his touring band and they were all so used to playing with each other. It shows.<br /><br />In a way this album reminds me of \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" the album that I consider Mr. Ds best. Every song on \\"The Tracks\\" belongs there, an integral part of the whole. Sure every song stands alone, but together they make a masterpiece. That's the way it is with \\"Love & Theft.\\" I don't know if this is the best album Mr. D has ever done, cuz I still listen to \\"The Tracks,\\" all the time, but if it's not the best, it's certainly number two. And who knows, after listening to it for another year or so, I may reevaluate that, but for now I'll give \\"Love & Theft\\" five stars. This CD is so good it'll make you cry.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|Takes pictures but it can't do anything else I didn't like it if you want it get it but is not so good just sayin
B00026WU82|5.0|Some children got lullabies, but my hippie parents played Dylan all they time, especially this record, no \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\" in our house. So pardon me if I'm a little biased toward this one. There isn't a bad song on \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" and there isn't even any songs that are better than the others, they're all outstanding. Everybody's heard \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" a song that coulda been the Stones anthem (in fact they did get around to recording it thirty-five years later). \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" is the rocker that starts the album and \\"Desolation Row,\\" is the eerie, very long song that ends it. I feel like I'm slighting the great songs in between, but I just can't list them all, but they are all superb.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Was great so hope there is more to come did use the hints a few times . but never felt cheated , worth every coin
B0009MAP9A|5.0|My father told me he was disappointed in \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" and when I asked why, he said that it wasn't nearly as good as \\"Freewheelin.'\\" And there you have the problem with a lot of Dylan fans, Bob is always changing, moving on and it's hard for his fans to keep up. The title song of this album is a raging protest against the establishment, one young people could still be singing today. \\"Girl from the North Country\\" is a tender love song that zings straight to your heart. \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,\\" a ballad that just makes you want to scream, \\"Why!\\" My dad was wrong about this record back then, thankfully he knows it now.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"The Times they are a-Changin'\\" is a call to arms. It was heeded in the Sixties when the streets were filled with protesters, kids who wanted an end to the war in Vietnam. Dylan has sung this song countless times over the years, talking about the battle that is outside raging, but somehow we've forgotten this message, though we sing the words with Dylan at almost every concert he's given on his never ending tour. Sadly there are almost no protesters today. And it seems if one does raise a voice, bad things could happen to him.<br /><br />Lord, I have to wonder if God ever was on our side. Bob Dylan doesn't think he was, but there are so many today who are convinced he is, maybe they should listen to this record. At least we've done something about the horrible racism Dylan sings about on \\"Only a Pawn in Their Game\\" and the haunting \\"Ballad of Hollis Brown,\\" but we have a long way to go. I think all those people who are so against those who only want to better themselves by coming to America should be forced to sit down and listen to this record. That's what I think.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|It's been so long since I read a novel I couldn't put down.  I adored this book. Get it as fast as you can.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|If you had to choose your favorite Dylan album, well I guess you couldn't do that, so let's say if you had to choose your top five favorites, then this would have to be on the list. This is the album where Dylan gave birth to folk rock when he went electric. \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" is a fast electric number that's very rap like. That's right, I said rap, way back in 1965.<br /><br />\\"Maggie's Farm\\" is a scorcher. The two electric ballads, \\"Love Minis Zero-No Limit\\" and \\"She Belongs to Me,\\" are haunting in their beauty. Rick Nelson used to sing these and his versions are just as good as Dylan's. And, of course, I can't forget to mention \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" a song my dad told me he'd been trying to figure out for almost four decades. You gotta own this CD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this version very much. Especially how it auto fills. It keeps track of your stats and shows conveniently, not as a nuisance.
B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|For a long time this was very high on my list of favorite Dylan records, but I must admit I haven't listened to it a lot lately. I suppose that's because I've been playing the new stuff quite a bit. Anyway, Mr. D. left Colombia for a bit, moved over to David Geffin's Asylum Records and did two albums, this one and the live \\"Before the Flood,\\" before he went back home to Colombia.<br /><br />\\"Planet Waves\\" was recorded with the Band and Dylan's voice was in fine form. There are two versions of \\"Forever Young,\\" on this record, both outstanding, I supposed Dylan put them both on there cuz he couldn't make up his mind. \\"Hazel\\" is a terrific ballad and the acoustic, \\"Wedding Song,\\" that closes the record is a masterpiece.
0385528787|5.0|Margaret Atwood's astounding new novel MaddAddam brings to an end the trilogy which began a decade ago with Oryx and Crake, then continued with The Year of the Flood in 2009.  The trilogy takes place in a New World, dramatically reshaped after the \\"Waterless Flood,\\" a global pandemic caused by extreme genetic manipulation.  This third book brings back characters from the first two, including Jimmy (a.k.a. Snowman), Toby, Ren, and Amanda.  This time there is more of a focus on the character of Zeb, Toby's lover, with his previous life revealed via flashbacks.  Meanwhile, in the present, events are moving toward either a resolution of sorts or a fall into even greater chaos.  Going against the decade it took for Ms Atwood to write this most unique and masterful trilogy, I read the three books back-to-back-to-back.  As a result, some portion of my mind is still immersed in this world she created, and I expect its strange creatures and environments will continue to echo in my thoughts for weeks to come.
B00026WU7I|5.0|If you had to pick out a number one Dylan record, one that shines above the rest, and that's very hard to do, but if you had to do it, you'd half to pick, \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\" Recorded shortly after Mr. D's divorce, you can feel his pain. These songs are full of hurt, rage, confusion and so much else.<br /><br />This album starts the heart pounding with \\"Tangled up in Blue,\\" and doesn't let you go till the last note of \\"Buckets of Rain.\\" \\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts,\\" is a haunting cowboy ballad and I'm still waiting for the movie. \\"Shelter from the Storm,\\" \\"You're a Big Girl Now,\\" songs that speak to the soul. This record is classy, beautiful, original and one you should play till you wear out your CD (if that's possible).
B008602KQI|3.0|The film was creative and unique, but when I watch a movie, I want it to make me feel good or teach me something.  There was too much death, unfair treatment, hopelessness in this film for me.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I am enjoying tending Nemo's reef. It's fun to see all the new plants and fish as they appear. I guess my only complaint would be that the pearls necessary for the extraordinary plants which the game asks you to get are VERY slow in coming. The treasure chests often require pearls to open and then may only contain less than 100 algae. It takes days and days to acquire the pearls and young ones lose interest.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We had no streaming devices at the time, so this device is gold for us. It's super easy to cast from a mobile device or your computer. I can't wait until they add more apps!
0440237688|5.0|fits great would buy again. i think the price was perfect for the item i purchased. would like to purchase more
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Though there is the early detraction from the excitement that starts to build when Marcus and his buddies are flying into Afghanistan, I think that detraction (to his days in Indoc and BUD/S) is very useful.  Many times when you read books involving SEALs, the reader does not get the feel of what they each went through just to earn the distinction.  This book takes care of that, and provides an awesome insight into a tragic event.
B0019M2ITY|3.0|The quality of the watch was poor and it felt really cheap and was very small. Not worth the money and the stones tend to fall off.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|The blending of the voices, the beat box, the changes from song to song within a single presentation, just makes this an absolute requirement for anyone even interested in acapella.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I like Tom Cruise movies (except for that ridiculous movie he made with Cameron Diaz) and this one is typical of the action/hero movies he is so good at.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Not available outside the US, but with Amazon (and international shipping) it is here and working very well in Singapore.<br /><br />Setting up on an iffy WIFI took quite a bit of time, but when it was all set up, it was a cinch to use, and I LOVE IT!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Worth watching! Entertaining action sequences, pretty good plot- (some details are a stretch-what action movies' aren't) the cameos are fantastic.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|This original BBC show is exactly that, original. So refreshing these days in entertainment full of do- overs.  While it is not for all audiences, rated MA, the acting is impressive, and the story compelling and addictive. Tatiana Maslany plays a variety of characters, so diverse, you forget it is the same actress, except for the face. The story, generally speaking, is about human clones, part of some kind of scientific experiment and the conspiracy surrounding these young women as they learn about themselves.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|I found this book slightly overrated, I must say. Sure, it was ok and somewhat thrilling page turner...but nothing spectacular, just OK. Read it and forgot about it.
B001R4BTSU|5.0|Well, I've fallen in love again. This time with this leggy blond from Philadelphia who seems to perform most of the time in Europe. A long interesting story about her. She took up music after being seriously injured in a car vs. bike accident. Spent a year flat on her back in a hospital! Anyway, she is another find from &#34;Later...&#34; and this is all smokey hot jazz, sung by a smokey hot girl who jumps back and forth between English and French with ease.<br /><br />This is a quiet 180 gm. album that intensifies the mellowness of Gardot's voice. All in minty condition.
B00101ZOTK|5.0|Everything about this movie is fantastic, from actors and locations to direction and story.  If you haven't seen this classic, it's a must-view film.
B00BKBCM4A|5.0|I have to say, I'm very fond of this album. Having seen Ms. Ware just recently, I decided to give the album a chance. It's good. The highlight for me is &#34;Night Light&#34; and &#34;Wildest Moments&#34; which is also remixed as a bonus with ASAP Rocky.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy playing this app. It's a cute with game with good graphics. My only compliant is that some of the challenges are almost impossible without extreme luck or real money.
030758836X|5.0|This is another book that keeps you reading and reading to find out what the ending is.  It has a very surprising ending/
B0088W7VNG|4.0|Good series with nice combination of adventure, drama and humor. Only negative was the constant changes in the Atlantis leader. And Robert Picardo (the holographic doctor from Star Trek Voyager) really didn't fit that role. All in all a very entertaining series that probably needed one more season to wrap things up.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Monkey Boxing is fun to play. You can customize your Monkey Boxer with colors patterns hair, hat, etc. Kinda nice.
0062082353|5.0|The book was well written, easy to read and gives us a look into what kind of man Chris Kyle was.<br />Telling the story in a first hand account.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun fun game but occasionally has glitch that takes away New lives or locks up. I've had to remove and 're-install but then get bonuses that more than make up for it. I like that it gives you your playing time but also helps you avoid getting carried away and spending too much time. There's only typically 5 lives but the restoration time is pretty quick and you don't have to wait for all 5 before playing again.
B004VFK5LO|4.0|Great Movie from the 90s Harry Conick was AWESOME as was the entire cast.<br />its like a criminal minds episode only 2 hours long :-)<br />only bad thing is why they didnt make more ??? its a perfect set up for a series or atleast a few sequels<br />what they should do is ressurect S. Weavers character and make her a guest on a Criminal minds Episode.<br />HINT HINT CBS HINT HINT
030758836X|5.0|Here is who this book will not be good for.  1. people who don't like a story told from two different viewpoints.  2. People who don't like books that bounce back and forth between the past and the present.  3. People accustomed to crime shows on TV that always wrap things up nice and tidy.  So much has already been written about this book but I will add my own little critique. I really did enjoy the book, it reminded me a book called \\"The Lie\\". The reason for this is both are told by more than one viewpoint. This method of writing can be very tricky for the reader to believe the viewpoints of the narrator of each viewpoint. In the case of Gone Girl I did not believe it was Nick narrating his chapter viewpoints, it felt more like what Amy thought and believed that this was what and how Nick would behave. Outside of this one gripe I definitely enjoyed the book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|If you just want to be entertained for a couple hours, this is a good pick.<br />Has action, humor and pretty darned good acting.<br />The whole family can watch it!
B00B3EJ292|5.0|It is a must watch movie,awesome acting and full of life. The actor did a fantastic job.Simply loved the movie.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Avatar is just the right amounts of fantasy, sci-fi, romance and drama.<br />It's the most visually beautiful movie I've ever watched...bet you'll watch  it repeatedly, each time gleaning something new from the story!
B001H5X7I4|4.0|Of course, my judgment of comedy is warped by having grown up in the era of Jack Benny, Fred Allen, Easy Aces, et al (Radio) and W.C Fields, Cary Grant, Marx Brothers, et al(Movies). So I make no claim to represent the current movie-going, DVD buying generation. I found it to be amusing, no outright laughs, inevitable dead spots; overall, worth having watched although probably not one to lose sleep over missing. No need to repeat that the language is not that common among many Americans and that being offensive to various and sundry groups was deliberate and frequent. If these things bother you or the group with whom you will watch this on television, giving it a miss will not cut you off from anything you will be sorry for. It does have some fine performers in it, mostly chewing the scenery (as they were supposed to) but still fun to watch.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|What a talent and at such a young age! I love that every song is different, from beautiful ballads to mellow reggae with some hip hop thrown in, to energetic pop and writhing, sexy R&B. There are very few people who can do this, who are this versatile. So sorry I missed his show here in SD. That won't happen again. I would recommend this CD to anyone tired of the sameness of most artists and out for a little adventure, and some downright pure, hedonistic enjoyment.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|as far as novels go, it's entertaining enough. Not a masterpiece, and at times eminently predictable, but good fun. The *really* nice part about this novel that made me give it 5 stars is the truckloads of 80's and early 90's reference pertaining to computer and console games, music and movies. I grew up in exactly the era the novel touches on, and I'm a sucker for all that stuff from my childhood, so I ended up enjoying it inmensely. Also it's about an MMO, and I love MMOs, so even better. I'll be the first to admit that if it had talked about pop culture from another decade I wouldn't have liked it nowhere nearly as much. But it did, and it caters very well to nerds who grew up in the 80's, and I LOVED it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I got it and hooked it up in just minutes. No issues with connectivity, no problems with the App. I immediately had it streaming Netflix and it seems to work perfect.<br />The only reason I dropped 1 star is that it needs more apps to stream.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|there isn't a star rating for really liked and that was what I wanted to rate it. the beginning was good with the bankruptcy and the firm struggling. the cases were mostly taken from the news and loved the recurring characters like Michael J. Fox and Carrie Preston.<br />However, it kinda struggled in the last five episodes but I am still excited for the next season with Alicia and Cary at a new firm
0321637739|5.0|In 1992, W. Richard Stevens wrote Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (APUE), published in 1993 by Addison-Wesley. The original edition was revised in 2005 by Stephen A. Rago to more accurately reflect the landscape of UNIX and UNIX-like systems. In 2013, Rago wrote an updated 3rd edition upon which this review is based.<br /><br />APUE is targeted at readers with a working knowledge of UNIX and C. It includes chapter long examples of real-world applications, and manages to simultaneously serve as an enlightening tutorial and a valuable reference book.<br /><br />Few technical authors have had such a great impact on the geek community as Rich Stevens, and because of this, any review of his books should include a few words about the man himself. Stevens' work typically tops any \\"recommended reading\\" list when it comes to TCP/IP networking or UNIX programming. Stevens passed away on September 1st, 1999. In addition to APUE, he authored UNIX Network Programming (Volume 1: APIs and Volume 2: IPC) and TCP/IP Illustrated (Volume 1: Protocols, Volume 2: Implementation, and Volume 3: TCP/T, HTTP, NNTP, Unix Domain Protocols.) Stevens was posthumously awarded the USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award for his extraordinarily lucid teaching and generous spirit within the community, which was accepted on his behalf by his wife and children.<br /><br />Stephen A. Rago, who accepted the daunting task of revising Stevens' APUE, worked at Bell Laboratories as a UNIX SVR4 developer. His first contact with Rich Stevens was an e-mail regarding a typographical error in Stevens' first book, UNIX Network Programming. Stevens later acted as a technical reviewer for Rago's UNIX System V Network Programming. Rago reciprocated as a technical reviewer for the first edition of APUE, and has done a fine job of revising that same text for the second edition and third editions.<br /><br />Rago's revisions to the third edition reflect the following changes:<br />* The text now covers version4 of the Single UNIX Specification (SUS).<br />* STREAMS-related interfaces have been obsoleted per SUS POXIS.1-2008.<br />* The following platforms are covered: FreeBSD 8.0, Linux 3.2.0 (the Ubuntu 12.04 distribution), Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Darwin 10.80.0), and Solaris 10.<br />* Linux 2.6 changed to the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).<br />* \\"In total, this edition includes more than 70 new interfaces, including interfaces to handle asynchronous I/O, spin locks, barriers, and POSIX semaphores. Most obsolete interfaces are removed, except for a few ubiquitous ones.\\"<br /><br />Stevens believed that the best way to learn code was to read code, and his books reflect that philosophy well. The original edition contained a chapter titled \\"Communicating with a PostScript Printer\\" that included a complete program to communicate over a RS-232 serial connection to an attached printer. Most printers today are accessed via a network interface, and in the second and third editions Rago has changed the material to reflect this while still maintaining the original intent of the chapter.<br /><br />This book is no superficial update from the previous edition. From cover to cover, it's apparent that Rago has carefully interpreted the original text and rewritten it to accurately reflect the changes of the past several years; he has also managed to preserve to original lucid and efficient presentation style of Stevens' classic.

B00992CF6W|3.0|I purchased this because my grandson wanted to play this game with me, but its very hard to use with my kindle and wish it was more user friendly
0385528787|5.0|I've read most of Margaret Atwood's novels and enjoyed them all, including her latest MaddAddam. Some of my favorites have been A Handmaid's Tale, Cat's Eye, The Blind Assassin and the first two in this trilogy, Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood. I find I am never disappointed by her stories.<br /><br />It's been about ten years since I read Oryx and Crake and three since I read The Year of the Flood, so I found the four-page summary of those at the beginning of this book to be very helpful as a refresher to the tale. MaddAddam picks up where The Year of the Flood leaves off. Toby continues to narrate the story and tells how the survivors get along in the decimated new world. MaddAddam is just as clever and fantastic as the previous books in the trilogy. I continue to be amazed at the plots and subject Matter Atwood comes up with. Every detail is so well thought out and the story captivating. As usual, I couldn't put the book down once I started. It's the best book I've read in a while.<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend MaddAddam to any Atwood fans, but I don't think the books in the trilogy should be read out of order. I believe MaddAddam will give the reader a lot more satisfaction if Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood are read first. Because the stage is set with surreal details, it helps to have an understanding of the people (bioengineered, hybrid, and the like) and groups before diving into this third book.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|My daughter hasn't stopped playing.  She's 11 & she enjoys it very much. I highly recommend it, especially if you like fun app boxing.
B001AOKA3W|1.0|It is amazing how this movie seems to be a polarizing product for audiences---people either love it or hate it. One word says it all: AWFUL. I'll tell you why. Yes, it is about these 5 young people who have to survive in Manhattan after a very BIG monster invades the city. Godzilla comes to mind, without the trademark screech. But in Cloverfield the monster comes suddenly out of nowhere and it is hellbent on destroying buildings, so about the only thing the 5 main characters have to do is scream, run, shout, cry, scream, run run run, scream, cry, and argue about which direction to take next. That is what passes off as ACTING in this sorry movie. Thus, there is no real PLOT. The actors just scream and run. Where did the beast come from? They don't say. What does it want? They don't say. What's the plan? They don't say. Heck, the actors are so bland and unidimensional that we really don't care if all of them DIE in the movie!  The ONE saving grace is that the special effects are good. This movie would have been better if it had been about a mindless monster destroying empty buildings in Manhattan---without ANY PEOPLE (with no acting talent). That would have been more palatable. Don't waste you money on this bomb. Watch Godzilla vs Mothra---it'll be more fun. Moral of watching this movie: special effects alone cannot save this sorry dog.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|Paid for the app and got all sorts of ads anyhow. Deleting from my phone. Don't bother. Ripoff. Waste of a couple bucks.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|If you like match 3 games, then this is one for you. It has good game play, good power ups. I got the game for free, but would be worth the cost of a paid version. Get it!

B002SHD9E2|4.0|My four year old granddaughter loved it. She can already sing most of the songs. My daughter is obsessed with the phantom.
B003Y74KC0|1.0|Loved this case when I got it.  The feel is great and it isn't bulky.  But after about 6 weeks, it is really loose and flimsy.  Its about a quarter inch too big length wise now because it has stretched out. The only thing I do with this phone is put it in and out of my purse.  Not sure why it stretched out and I wouldn't buy it again.  I'm so bummed..........don't want a hard case.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I love that this show isn't all sunshine and roses. The family had some things happen that you want to rant and cry about, but that attaches you to them all the more. My only minor dislike is how much time jumps. Leaves you hanging a bit...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I choose to give this book 5 stars. When I started reading it I wasn't able to put it down and finished it in one day :-)
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|But in a good way. Interesting story line between two central characters with plenty of colourful folks included. Ready to try some Rock buns and jam tarts with tea.
1932100660|5.0|You do not have to be overweight, diabetic, have cancer, heart failure, eye floaters, PAD, strokes and many of the other medical issues making doctors and big pharma rich!  Read the book!  This is not just what Doctor Campbell thinks but he looks at tons of research.  Hundreds of studies with thousands upon thousands of human and non-human subjects.  Don't you want to know why much of the world is so healthy and we are not?  Don't you want to know if almost everything we are doing is making us sick?  Including the medical community?

B003TJR2HS|4.0|hey everyone, just letting you know, i used this as an extender on a g37s ipod cable, it played the songs perfectly with good sound quality, however it did NOT charge my ipod, i tried my ipod touch 1st & 3rd gens, neither would charge. when i used this product on my old ihome, it DID charge my iPods, where-as the standard dock would not. The product worked great, i was just hoping for a charging ability in my car. i would recommend this to others if you are just looking for an adapter to fit with a case and an ihome or any other kind of ipod dock. :)
B00COGY2P2|4.0|The film is surprisingly much better than I expected. It's not over done with special effects, which lets you concentrate on the charaters and the plot. Interesting twist.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|Everyone should read this, accept the responsibility for disinterest in anything outside his or her immediate surroundings,  and strive to put an end to the brutality of war, bigotry, and religious and ethnic persecution. This was an excellent portrayal of the horrors that transpired in Biafra, and the indifference of world powers. My only criticism is that the translator and editors made errors that created confusion in some sections. The transitions could have been better.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Once again Frederick Forsyth takes  you to a world that we hope.<br />Is working to keep the world safe for us and our country and our children. Forsyth writes in. a style that that wouldn't let you put it down. I hope he has time to do a few more .

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Good acting and smart screenplay with a few exceptions.  It's a 4 star show not 5 as I rested by accident but its still good
B00B7Y0206|1.0|When I opened this app, I was pleased with the layout and  the easy access. However, when I proceeded to open a video, I found that my kindle had been possessed! The audio for the video was playing, but the video itself was  nothing more than a black screen. Although some people have had success with this app, I give fair warning that it may ruin your kindle. Not only was I unable towards video, but I no longer ha  control over my kindle. I could neither turn the volume  down, return to the home screen, or, frankly, do anything! I was  left with no choice but to shut my kindle down. This is fair warning.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|Fun game for my 8yr old.  She loves that it has the 3 different attractions all included in one game.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Great information!  I had no idea that curly hair had to be handled differently from &#34;regular&#34; hair, and so appreciated what Ms. Massey shared.  Too, I am now using the Deva products and love them!  Makes all the difference in my life style.  Kudos to the author for putting this book together!

B000SEJHRA|5.0|This was the first David Sedaris book I have ever read. It was given to me to put a smile on my face after a particularly hard day and for days, until I finished it, it did just that. I would highly recommend it to anyone who ever thought something, but never told anyone. David Sedaris is not afraid to tell it like it is in a poetic way. I have since read the majority of his books and recommend him to everyone, however this book is still my favorite by him.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This one is addicting and fun!  I LOVE the minions anyway, so this comes with its own curb appeal, but the fact that it's easy enough for my 9 yr old to play helps too.  It's fun!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does what I want it to do.  No fuss or problems so far.  Only had it a couple days.  But seems fine.
B000089RVR|5.0|This is a wonderful album. I recently got into Dido because I love her voice and I wanted to expand my music interests by trying something more contemporary. The song most people will recognize from this album is the title track, \\"White Flag,\\" which is a radio favorite. I think my favorite song from this album would have to be \\"Don't Leave Home.\\" It's uplifting and very enjoyable and I find Dido's voice soothing, especially during the chorus. This album has been described as \\"folk\\" and I guess you could say it is, but it's also a blend of pop and light rock. If you liked Dido's previous album, \\"No Angel\\" you're bound to like this as well. I should also point out that there is a hidden track at the end. It's actually part of the track \\"See the Sun,\\" but after the main song ends, there is a two minute break of silence and then around the seven minute mark, Dido starts singing again for about four or five minutes more. The song is completely different from \\"See the Sun,\\" yet it's on the exact same track. You'll have to hear it for yourself to find out. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this album along with \\"No Angel.\\"
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I wanted to stream Netflix on my older 50\\" 720p plasma TV, and this little gadget fits the bill perfectly for a low cost. It requires a microUSB cable (provided) to power it, which can be plugged into either a USB port on your TV if available, or into a 120v wall adapter (also provided). It cannot be powered directly from the HDMI port alone, even if you have an MHL-HDMI port (source: Anandtech.com).<br /><br />We already have a Roku 2 XS in our living room, which does a considerable bit more than the Chromecast. But it's bigger and bulkier, it costs more, and it does a lot more than what we actually need. If the Chromecast ever gets Amazon Instant Video and Hulu Plus added to it, it will be our perfect little bedroom player. It can already play videos from those sources through a Chrome tab, but you need a desktop or laptop computer to supply that to the Chromecast; you can't currently cast a Chrome tab from your smartphone. Hulu and HBO are already working on getting their apps added to the Chromecast according to various online news sources, as well. Also, for Amazon/Prime Instant Video being cast from a Chrome tab, make sure you are using Flash as your video plug-in for Amazon and not Silverlight, as Silverlight (and Quicktime) videos can't be cast from a Chrome tab to the Chromecast. If you are already using Silverlight (you'll know when the video won't cast properly), the solution is to go into your browser and disable the Silverlight plug-in in your settings. Then reload the Amazon video page and choose Flash as the player when it prompts you. Once you have done that, you can then re-enable Silverlight in your browser settings.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Chromecast over the Roku 2 XS is the Netflix loading screens. You get a nice big cover image of the show (like a DVD's cover art; not just a still image grabbed from the playback) with the name of the episode on it instead of just looking at a loading bar. Incredibly slick, to say the least.<br /><br />The use of a smartphone to control the device may seem a bit off-putting at first, but since we already have our smartphone by our side nearly all the time, it's nice not having to worry about an extra remote. If you've ever used the YouTube-to-XBox360 streaming feature, the Chromecast works exactly the same; you start up the video app on your phone, and then you click the little TV icon and it transfers over the streaming duties from your phone to the Chromecast. A big plus to this method is that it truly does TRANSFER the duties over; your phone does not act as a middle-man, but rather, the Chromecast connects and steams directly through your wifi with its own video app, and your phone just switches into remote control mode.<br /><br />I highly recommend picking up this device if you currently have a non-smart HDTV that you'd like to add Netflix, YouTube, and Google Play Video capabilities to it for a low cost ($35 at the time of this review). It's hard to go wrong for this price, especially with a Google product that has the potential for so much more capability down the road still.br />The use of a smartphone to control the device may seem a bit off-putting at first, but since we already have our smartphone by our side nearly all the time, it's nice not having to worry about an extra remote.

A big plus to this method is that it truly does TRANSFER the duties over; your phone does not act as a middle-man, but rather, the Chromecast connects and steams directly through your wifi with its own video app, and your phone just switches into remote control mode.<br /><br />I highly recommend picking up this device if you currently have a non-smart HDTV that you'd like to add Netflix, YouTube, and Google Play Video capabilities to it for a low cost ($35 at the time of this review). It's hard to go wrong for this price, especially with a Google product that has the potential for so much more capability down the road still.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love this book! This is the second book of the series and I personally think it's better than the first. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone who is of eight to 13 years old!
B004EPYZOY|1.0|Not because the quality of the film, it is because I don't receive it till now. After so many feedback I send, I don't receive not a single email from amazon. I am a very disappointing with the service and I am feel cheated.

I passed it on to our daughter and have just sent it to our eldest granddaughter--whom I see as a &#34;Pollyanna.&#34;  It is a lovely book about a young girl for whom &#34;life is good!&#34;  The situations change, but she sees the bright side and we all need to try to do that more often.  Good read for all ages.
B002AY9ILQ|5.0|I rate this video 5 stars!!  I consider myself an admirer of Amy Winehouse and of all the concerts I've seen this is the BEST!!!  Also her performance in London at Porchester Hall was also very good.  Nearly every song you want to hear Amy sing is on this video.  Her performance is truly heartfelt.  I love her band and backup singers!!  The delivery was fast and the video came wrapped so I know it was brand new.  Would order again if the Porchester Hall (2007) video was offered.  Miss you Amy :(  but glad you left your legacy for future generations to enjoy!!!  :)
1426308469|5.0|I got this for my friend's 3-year-old who LOVES dinos and books. He's super-smart and knows the real names (like apatosaurus) for the usual dinosaurs. This book was perfect for him, because it has really beautiful illustrations of the usual suspects (t-rex, triceratops, etc.) and some lesser-known dinos. This is where the parents need to get out those thinking caps--the lesser-known dinos have crazy hard to pronounce names. The book gives you a handy pronunciation guides, but you might still need a little practice before you sit down to read this one to your kiddo.<br /><br />Overall, it's beautiful to look at and full of information. Maybe too advanced for the littlest kiddos, but they'll probably still love to have you read it to them while they look at the pictures.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I am not ashamed to say that I am a 49 yr. old mom who thoroughly enjoyed this movie as well as the soundtrack.  Pharell is a genius when it comes to this soundtrack.  It is lively and lifts your spirits.  Even my husband enjoyed it!  His favorite is the song about the &#34;Beautiful Girls&#34; and mine is &#34;Fun, Fun, Fun&#34;.  You can't be angry and listen to this soundtrack, it will have you laughing and smiling before it's finished.  Finally, something refreshing in lyrics!!
