B00A9X9ORI|2.0|Garbage. Not enough story about the loop. No resolution on what happens when the past is changed. Characters are good story sucked.
B005HSL626|4.0|Another fun game for your tablet or smart phone.  It’s more fun on tablets the added room to operate helps a lot.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It is a fine product and it works really well.  I like the quality and the color of the cover.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I you liked angry birds you may like this game.  It’s the same kind of quirky fun as angry birds
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Very good show.  Good to see a show without all of the violence and sex, which is still very entertaining.
B005LAII12|4.0|Turned out my brother and I gave each other the same gift.  When I saw this in the theaters, I held off telling some people about it because it's so outrageous.  It's one of those movies that get funnier the more you think about and remember some great lines.  I know we'll pull this one out (huh?) to watch, just like we do The Big Labowski.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are disproportionately challenging but others are loads of fun. My kids play till they cant figure it out then hand it to me.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|This movie was actually awesome and not what expected.  It was even better than expected. I would recommend this movie to someone else for certain.<br /><br />Thanks!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book!!!  Alot of action and very engaging!!!  Couldn't put it down!!!!  I would definitely recommend this book to everyone!!!
B002KEZ96Y|3.0|Not at all what was expected by being a first time watcher of this movie, but it was still a decent movie.
B0079MLF7O|5.0|Haunting lyrics with beautiful sound and gorgeous cover picture! <3 The bells and string in Video Games is gorgeous. Note: Video Games was nominated for one of the best songs in the world in 2012
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Loved it..couldn't stop laughing. My 14 year old daughter can't stop watching it. Definately one for the video collection. Thanks!!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|This study Bible is wrtten with notes that explain parts of the Bible that may be questioned.  I have a copy in my Kindle and find it very handy to carry it along with me and understand the Bible better than just reading the Bible
0345803485|1.0|Abuse is what it is all about. I detested it. I would not reccommend it to anyone not even my dog if she could read.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I bought this album a month ago and we have listened to it over and over and over again while on the road and continue to fully enjoy it each and every time we hear it! Very rarely do I buy an album (any album, not Maroon 5) that doesn't have at least a few songs I want to skip over, but this one doesn't have any that I don't like at least a little bit. Some are better than others, but all are fun to listen to and sing along with. I must say that I remember when my older kids (now 28, 29, and 30) were listening to Maroon 5 on the radio as teens, I really didn't pay any attention, so I can't compare this album to their older stuff. But for the last 4-5 years, I've been a fan. It's quite obvious that Adam Levine has a singular thought pattern when it comes to his songs, but I love his voice. The boy can sing.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Daughter downloaded it to her kindle and prob has watched it 50 times in the last 2 weeks, loves it!!
B0097S0TM0|2.0|I am a huge Pink fan and love her music. Even my kids beg me to put in her CDs when we're on the road. So when I saw she had a new album out, I had to have it! I could not have been more disappointed. I don't like it. And I didn't buy the explicit version (didn't know there was one), so I'm not complaining about the swearing as some other reviewers have, although I would have complained about the \\"f\\" word popping up, esp. with my kids listening. I can't really think of even one song on this CD that I really liked. It was a big let down. So save your $$ and wait for her next album. This one was not typical Pink fare to me.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is the most widely used apps for any mobile/tab/apple I hope :) For Kindle, there was a problem that it was not desplaying more than 10 posts/updates. I hope this problem is resolved. It is working very smooth for my KFHD 8.9. Thanks developers.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I chose this rating because i love this show. So it was great that i could get them on here
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I love this book even better than his last book, &#34;Locked On&#34;.  It's hard to put it down.  You won't be disappointed if you've read any of the other Jack Ryan novels.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I always give five stars when I literally cannot stop reading. I devoured this book in one sitting. Practical advice and great examples; John Locke gives you a realistic action plan for marketing your books. Highly recommended!
0451232852|5.0|Folllett in top form. It's a real high-wire act to create, assemble and interweave that massive cast of characters. And he's caught the emotional conflicts of the WWI period perfectly.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Enjoyed it thoroughly.  Good actors, good story...  Worth it!  Never knew which way it was going to end up.  Will watch this director.
0374275637|4.0|Not easy going, but well worth the effort. His analyses will continue to come to mind whenever I have a major decision to make.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is good. The upgrades are a little slow to earn and keeping up with the computer is difficult but overall a fun, addictive game.
0316228532|4.0|Internecine small-town politics would seem an unlikely focus for a novel, but she makes the tensions both involving and emblematic of larger issues. Characters are broadly drawn, but appropriately sympathetic or antithetic.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and very happy to watch it again. Everything about his movie is wonderful. So real to life, yet gave hope to life. Acting was superb. So was the small town the movie was shot in. Love the end!
0525952926|4.0|Quintessiential Follett. Cast of thousands, expertly drawn and interwoven against an interesting historical background. I found it a little slower going than &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;, with some annoying verbal tics, like &#34;such as&#34;, invariably, where &#34;like&#34; would have served better without seeming ponderous. And would somebody tell his copy editor that the synonym for &#34;uptight&#34; or &#34;prudish&#34; is spelled &#34;straitlaced&#34;? Like &#34;straitjacket&#34;, it's not about being without bends or curves, but about being narrrow, confining.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|So glad I watched this movie. What a great way to start a new year. This movie was filled with hope in that no matter what life seems to show you there is more to see.
B0083EW97W|1.0|I have to admit that I have yet to listen to this whole album and I purchased it the week that it came out. It's so bad ... it's nothing like previous John Mayer CDs. Yes, yes ... I do understand that's what JM was trying to do, but really? It's awful.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|what can I say about this app.  everyone is hooked on Facebook...I've found long lost friends which is great and I keep in touch with family and friends from all over the state's.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This move was the worst movie that I have ever seen, the focal point was nothing but a foul mouth bear. Save your money and pass this movie up..<br /><br />I cannot belive Mark Wahlberg agreed to make a movie like this.
B0086700CM|5.0|they just got this and they love it...  they love the monkeys too..they played for along time on this game
B00631VJIC|4.0|It is a good CD that I would recommend to other SOA fans.  You will recognize the music from the show.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love that the kids need to use their imagination with this app yet they have so much fun with it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great family game.  We have teenagers & an 8yrs old.  This game was fun for all!  We played several times over the holiday break.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Very cute game app that keeps my 9 year old grand daughter occupied and very happy.  she's very into the littlest pet shops so this app is perfect.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|The blue ray acts as both the 3d and regular version. The bonus dvd is nice. No digital copy like a lot of movies do.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game. could not put my pad down all day. please make more like this please please please
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you like solitaire this is a simple app. That's all it is no extras but they do have lots of ads.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book could not put it down, I found my self right there with the characters, I hope E. L. James is planning to write another simalar book. I enjoyed this book so much.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I make notes for myself, for work and I save recipes in here. I guess you could do anything with it. One day I hope to upgrade so I can use all the features. Very helpful when you have a busy life.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|When my father bought me this book as a gift for Christmas, I did not intent to read it at all ( I don't like reading ) but then I decided I might as well give it a try. After just few minutes, the book aroused my interest and I just read on.<br />Very entertaining in deed. It portraits life and death situations along with a slight tuch of comedy. Definitely worth reading.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is an awesome game.  I owned it for the PC, and it works awesome on my tablet. Check it out if you haven't played it yet.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|I was surprisingly disappointed in the movie. It was okay for two adults to watch but I imagine it would be quite scary for a child. I wouldn't recommend this to my friends with kids.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had my Kindle 1 year and the wire literally fell apart so I didn't use it. Just. Recently I called Kindle and there had been a batch of bad ones. Thank you Kindle for the replacement.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You, is as good as the Shade of Grey books.I can't wait for the next one to come out!
0765325950|5.0|I have pre-ordered my copy of MOL. It is projected to be delivered today. I can't understand why anyone is complaining about this book, good or bad. The true story and its magic image died with Jordan. It is sad and unfortunate that he was unable to finish writing and publishing it himself; but for anyone who has read the story from beginning to end, Jordan's last books of WOT were not his best. Sanderson would not have been my first choice to finish this story, but he has been a much needed breath of fresh air to this series. I have high hopes for MOL whatever the POV plot endings will be, and I am thankful get to close this chapter of my life.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Good CD with a lot of Perry's songs.Good addition to any pop music collection. This is a good sampling of her work.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|This movie had great potential but did not provide the great story line as the previous movie.  To bad this is a great story that could have been a great film.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The season starts off perfect! I like the whole idea on how the group is actually more unified after getting rid of a certain character and how they're working great together. I've seen the first episode so far and it's looking very good!
B000W93CHC|5.0|If you love Pillars of the Earth like I did, you will also love World without End. Some of the characters in the Pillars of the Earth have relatives 200 years later in this book. Just a great read.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I have no bad words to say about this book.  Imaginative, original, hilarious.  Definitely a book worth the read. I found myself laughing aloud in my room, alone numerous times.  Can't believe I hadn't heard of it sooner!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!!! It was easy to get wrapped up in the love story of trav and Abby.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a fun little game.  I wish I could have more colors sooner--I can't afford to buy more yet! It does make me think, tho, about how I'm going to convey a word with just one picture--some are easier than others!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I like books written  by the author in the dogs words.<br />They are so loving and moving.  And sometimes funny.
B00785P2QC|3.0|its a great way to kill time. I just hope some of the bugs are fixed soon.  It crashed when I attempted to like it on facebook.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|A good sequel to the Expendables!  If you just want an entertaining movie this is a good one.  Good action scenes.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I promise you will enjoy this. A much better story line than all previous movies, plus bane is fun to watch. A must have for all movie collections!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Overall, it's a good movie.  It lacks a good story, it's very predictable and the end was not a surprise.  The original movie was not much better but if you liked it, then this is no different.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|It's hard to imagine really enjoying a book about management but here it is, direct to you from the nerdery, I really enjoyed this book! Daniel Pink explores what motivates people and how managers can shift styles to meet the changing needs of today's workforce. I have referenced this book dozens of times already in the first year of my MBA studies and daily with my work team. I have, and will continue, to recommend this read to anyone looking for a fresh perspective on motivation techniques.
0671891634|4.0|I have not read Mr.Lynch's other more famous book, which is 'One Up on Wall Street'. But after reading Beating the Street', I feel that I get the gist of Mr. Lynch's philosophy, and he gives his hands on experience on investing in stocks. His insight into the Japanese market was particularly revealing. He has written the book at the beginning of Japan's lost decade, and it is commendable that he has not joined the crowd on Japanese stock market frenzy. That said, this book does not give the reader a systematic way to invest and his method could be subjective. For that Benjamin Graham's \\"The Intelligent Investor\\" would be a perfect starting guide. Danger of Lynch's method could be that one thinks that one understands the business, when one really does not. In the investing world, it is very important to know what you know and what you don't know and know what is possible and what is impossible. It is the key to not lose money.
0375826742|4.0|I enjoyed this third book just like I enjoyed all of the books in this series. This one  sets the stage for the grand finale. I love that all the characters you have grown to love up to this point start colliding and coming together. Events and people are culminating toward the long-anticipated end. As always, I am impressed by Paolini's imagination and vision. I never stop wondering what he will come up with next.
1442444053|5.0|Great story that others have described well, this volume is beautiful: rich maroon cover with gold stampings; the large number of pictures are all glossy, color and look to be taken from paintings and done in what I view as a very British 1800's style of drawing. I was looking to add a hardcover copy of this story to my library and this one is a very satisfactory addition.
0061122416|4.0|This book has been on my \\"to-read\\" list for years. Finally it made its way to my Kindle and I'm so glad it did. I have concluded that I didn't read it before because I needed its message now. It is a little like a parable; in each section of the story there is a message and a lesson. The ultimate takeaway for me was to remember to have faith, take the next step, and always listen to the urges of my heart. I will read this again and I have no doubt that the meaning will be different for me each time I pick it up.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have played Spider for many years on my PC and recently found that I could play it on my Kindle.  I did not realize that I was buying it!
0307950654|1.0|Un-im-pressive. Jane Austen is rolling in her grave every time one of her fans picks up this book. The characters are twisted in ridiculous ways that felt sacrilegious. Pride and Prejudice is better left alone. If you haven't tainted the classic for yourself with this novel, don't.
B002LII6P0|5.0|This is a marvelous movie.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Brandon Fraser!  He is a great actor and a lot of fun to watch in any movie.<br /><br />If you like the &#34;Mummy&#34; movies you'll enjoy this as well.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was enjoying this book immensely and then.... I stumbled across an intriguing review that grabbed my attention and held it-right down to the spoilers. Dang it. Drat the dedicated reviewers who forget to warn about spoilers... After that it was hard for me to get engaged in the plot because I already knew what happened at the end. From that ruinous moment on, I continually tried to figure out how George/Jake got from point A to what I knew was going to happen down the line at point B. Until I knew how the ending was going to present itself, I was completely caught up in the story.  I can't fathom the amount of research that went into this work! That alone is an incredibly impressive authorial feat.<br />This novel is Stephen King's way of saying that everything happens for a reason. Spoilers be damned, I enjoyed the story and then I enjoyed imagining how things might be different with even the slightest change in the past. It's interesting to contemplate how our lives are built on moments. One second sooner, two minutes later, one inch to the left... All things perfectly timed.
B0001YRVN4|1.0|the disc's were used and shot. I was so disappointed. I should have bought new. In searching<br />for a new set locally the shop owner suggest that I invest another $5.00 per disc and run them<br />thru his machine for a good clean up. Worked like magic and my grandson and I enjoyed them<br />all without a glitch but buyer beware on any used DVD discs on the market.
0307744434|3.0|Just the title of this book made it feel magical. The idea of a night circus was so enchanting that I held off reading it, saving it like a dessert or a good bottle of wine.<br /><br />There are parts of this novel that I thoroughly enjoyed. I loved the descriptions of the circus and the midnight dinners. I loved the characters, varied and multi-faceted, the twins and Bailey easily becoming my favorites.<br /><br />I struggled with the story line. Even now I struggle with the thought of if there even IS a story line? I couldn't figure out what was going on until just past the halfway point and there are elements that I never found out. Once I thought I had a general idea, through a great deal of guessing and conjecture, I wasn't invested enough to care. I passed the climax of the plot (was there one? a climax or a plot?) with barely any notice as I scanned quickly over it to get back to an 'interesting part'. As the story drew to a close, I just wanted to return to Widget, Poppet, and Bailey. My attention wandered  during this read so I was relieved once finished. My first thought was to give it two stars but remembering the descriptions of the circus and the endearing characters, I think I'll give it three...
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Though it's considerably different from the original \\"Rapunzel,\\" this version, like all true fairy tales, is both enjoyable and instructive.  The story itself, revolving around a thief and a bright, over-protected girl, follows them through harrowing adventures and narrow escapes, and in the end, they rescue each other.  I like it that Rapunzel has the gumption to engineer her own escape from the tower.  I like it that Flynn, the thief, gradually discovers his inner self through her influence to become Eugene.  The themes of every coming-of-age story are present, as well as a demonstration of the transformative powers of love.  A secondary theme, and in some ways the most important for our contemporary culture, is the subtle suggestion in the story of the mother/villain character that it is at least egotistical and selfish, if not downright evil--and in the end self-destructive--to refuse to grow old in the natural way of all living things.<br /><br />The animation, especially in the changing facial expressions of the characters, is nothing short of brilliant.  We see even the secondary characters gradually revealed and then transformed so clearly, line by line.  Maximus, the horse, is probably my favorite character in the movie, perfectly nuanced in every gesture, and hilarious.  I kept looking in the credits to find out who \\"played\\" him before I finally realized he didn't have a voice actor--it's all done with drawing, grunts, and snorts.  I also found myself rooting for all the dreams of the ruffians from The Fluffy Duckling.  The voice actors do a superb job, with voice and artwork blended seamlessly together, also no doubt thanks to the expertise of film editors.<br /><br />To quote an old song, this is a great movie \\"for kids from one to ninety-two.\\"  It would take a seasoned curmudgeon not to enjoy it.
0345803485|2.0|\\"They are calling this pornography!\\" And rightfully so....  This book is, for the most part, like reading a very well written forum letter. The vocabulary is much better but the content is par for the course. This book is appropriately marketed as erotic romance. A fair review cannot possibly fault the sexual content-you are warned when you read the book jacket. If erotic romance happens to be what you are in the market for, I imagine this is a good choice. I am unfamiliar with this genre, as this was my first novel from the erotic romance section. It is safe to say, it will also be my last. Sex scene after sex scene after one more sex scene didn't hold my interest. On the upside, I found the verbal banter between the main characters (during the times they were clothed and unfettered) well done and oftentimes humorous. E.L. James has a talent for sarcastic wit that comes out in the dialogue and I enjoyed those parts of this novel very much.<br /><br />So what is the big deal about this trilogy? Selling like wildfire and creating a windstorm of media attention, that is the question I wanted answered after I read this book. Let's face it, E.L. James did not invent BDSM (I had to look that up. Courtesy of Wikipedia, BDSM stands for bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism). Fifty Shades is not the first novel to explore that darker side of sexuality. So again, what's the big deal?<br /><br />It could be that the big deal is the market segment within which this novel is meeting its greatest success. A group of men ogling a Playboy isn't news. Conversely, 100,000 middle-aged suburban housewives publicly swooning over tales of bondage and dominance apparently is news.  At last check, this book sold over 250,000 digital and paperback copies (gasp!) and the question is: Harmless Fantasy or Dangerous Social Influence?  Hmmmm.... I have asked that question across a widely diverse group of people and the majority of them say it's a harmless fantasy. So if it's just a harmless fantasy, why all the fuss?  The Today show did a segment on the Fifty Shades trilogy and one of the guest professionals spoke of the long battle women have fought to earn their power, their place in the boardroom, the shattering of the glass ceiling. Her theory is that after such a long fight for power, women are yearning for a \\"little bodice ripping\\" which led to an unexpectedly fanatical response to Fifty Shades. If that's true, good news- Fifty Shades delivers more than a little bodice ripping. Another expert offered a different opinion, claiming that Fifty Shades promotes violence against women.<br /><br />Main character, Anastasia, has very low self-esteem. So low, in fact, she spends the majority of the novel contemplating a contract outlining the terms of a BDSM relationship with a supremely disturbed young man. And she thinks if she loves him well enough, is submissive enough, and does all the dark and scary things his sexual preference requires-he will change. She believes she can bring him around to a normal, healthy relationship. I ask you ladies, doesn't that aspect of Anastasia's plight sound like a frighteningly common problem among our gender? He'll change. We'll change. The circumstance will change. Is that an idea that we want to promote to our daughters?<br /><br />Everyone deserves a fantasy. If this is the fantasy that is improving marriages in the suburbs-well, all the better for E.L. James. I don't intend to make it a practice to concern myself over other people's fantasies; however, I became concerned when, in the Today show segment, one of the women shown in the featured book club  laughingly comments to the group (and the entire viewing population of the Today show), \\"Should I be concerned that I downloaded this to my daughter's Kindle?\\" Uhhhh... YES. Yes, you should absolutely be concerned about that. She has seen, on national television, her mother and all of her mother's beautiful, intelligent, successful friends claim that \\"every husband should read this book\\". Try explaining a normal, healthy relationship now. It wouldn't be funny anymore if the afore mentioned daughter came home with a guy who flogged her with a belt after she rolled her eyes. Still think it should be mandatory reading material for husbands? I'm all for a fantasy. Have several if you like. You might want to think carefully about who you share your fantasy with....<br /><br />All of that aside, considering the subject matter, I didn't think this was terribly written-it just wasn't for me.  This story made my stomach hurt. The debasement, humiliation, and deranged sexual preferences made me feel physically ill. I'll keep my girl power and  my bodice, thank you very much. James leaves you wondering how it will all work out for Anastasia but I don't have the stomach to read any more of these dark creations.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game. just like all g5 games, it will keep you busy for hours, I am hoping they release a sequel!
0143119680|3.0|I love the thought of a world crawling with secret sects of vampires and witches. This book creates a world in which those paranormal citizens exist and Harkness finds wonderful ways to explain popular myths and the ways in which demons, witches, and vampires have made their own impact on the world, and how that impact-good or bad-is explained away to protect the \\"humans\\" from knowledge of their existence. I enjoyed the magic and the fantasy in this novel and I'm relieved that it is only the first in a trilogy. The three-star rating is only a result of the romance fostered between Diana and Matthew. It seemed too fast. One minute there is a deep-seated lack of trust and a centuries old prejudice between vampires and witches and the next it's husband, wife, eternity, and our entire races will face war so we can be together. Too much, too fast on that piece. Beyond that a fun read. I'm anxious for the next one. This is another series that I think will improve with time. I anticipate enjoying the second one even more than I enjoyed this one. I already know and love the characters so jumping right back into their adventures should be no problem!
160459201X|5.0|I like this book alot because it uses stories to teach the lessons he wants you to learn and at the same time it keeps you interested in wantint to read the rest of the book.
0241953235|5.0|I was completely enchanted by this tale! I anticipated going through it to ultimately pass it on to my sister as something my niece might like. I think it might be a bit much for the little one for a few years but I am infinitely impressed by this story. It has been around for decades but this is my first encounter. I tried to explain to some of my bookish friends how taken I was by this story and they studied me with raised eyebrows, \\"It's about rabbits? You want us to stop everything and read a story about rabbits?\\" Well, yeah... It's not just about rabbits. It's about survival and love and taking a leap of faith. It's about friendship and sacrifice and believing that you deserve the best. It's about bravery, ingenuity, innovation, and testing your own limits. And, yeah, okay, it's also about rabbits. I loved it. I laughed, I cried, I held my breathe, I cried out. I can't wait until my niece is old enough.
1439181780|5.0|very useful book on staying positive and using love to conquer everything bad in life. Also a good guide to successful living.
0385344228|3.0|Again I find myself wishing for the 3.5 star rating option. This book held my interest from the beginning. Since I'm not a parent it's very difficult for me to relate to the characters. So much of this novel is about the differing views of the parents regarding their son's guilt or innocence in the murder of a classmate. I don't understand the blind-love and loyalty of parents, nor do I understand the guilt of parents who suspect something sinister in their offspring. That aside, as a reader, I found this tale gripping. I was taken completely by surprise at the end and think Landay did a terrific job of keeping readers attention throughout. I will definitely seek out more of his work.

B00849D5ME|3.0|I have got to read more of Lionel Shriver's work. I LOVED The Post Birthday World and I was struck dumb by We Need to Talk About Kevin. Of the two, I prefer The Post Birthday World. Frankly, I'm a pansy, so I enjoyed the safe world of relationships, snooker, and gourmet popcorn over school shootings, maternal instinct, supposed parental failure, and guilt. What I cannot dismiss is the incredible, inventive, and unorthodox ways Shriver develops to deliver her story to the reader. As I mentioned, I have read only two of her novels and both of them were written in a style and format that I have never previously encountered. One is nothing like the other but they are both endlessly fascinating in terms of form and format. We Need to Talk About Kevin got a little too wordy for me at times but at the close of the novel I understood better why that worked for the main character. Run-on sentences be damned because I was gripped and horrified and sickened the whole way through. This does not have a feel-good ending and although I stayed up until 3:00 am on a school night to finish the tale I felt depressed and horrified when it was all over. I am a devoted admirer of Shriver's writing and she was completely successful in creating a story that grabbed me, shook me, and still has not let go days after I turned the final page. So 3 stars instead of 4 just for giving me nightmares ;0), but smashing writing in my opinion.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it and the entire trilogy. This book kept me coming back night after night to finish it, and now that I have I hate that it is over.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Will Smith and Tommy Lee are hysterical together! I wanted to get parts 1 and 2 and view them one after the other. Great movie!
B00ARF92HK|3.0|January 8th instant video release date, huh? I call shenanigans. It's almost 3:00P.M. EST here and I see no such thing. You're a bunch of lying wizards and I hate you. I haven't seen the movie yet, so my review might change of you then. If not, I'mma be pissed.
B003IDMUVI|4.0|Up to his usual standard even that it was one of the earlier publications. I enjoy that there is no sex or swearing in the story line.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is one of the better games I have played on a mobile device. Simplistic in concept, but quick to ramp up in difficulty. I found it easy enough to pick-up-and-play, but hard to put down. And some of the boards will take a bit of thought. Overall, a very good game.<br /><br />(using original model Kindle Fire)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was captivated the whole book. I loved the action and the love story. I recommend reading this good nook.
B008LA7RMK|5.0|Nearly every BB album in the Sixties was a 'Greatest Hits' collection of wonderful musical compositions and heartfelt lyrics, experiences of American adolescent interests. Instead of including the mono versions, which everybody already has, it would have been great to have the instrumental tracks as engineered by the wondrous Mark Linett, to fully appreciate Brian Wilson's talent.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This book was just as fun as the tv show. I loved it and can't wait to read more! And there's plenty more :)
B004DM0UII|2.0|I got this on the Free App of the day... I sure am glade I did not pay for it. Searching for specific music is not easy and you still get ads just like on your normal FM radio. You still get ads with Pandora but it is still better than this ap. Save your money and skip this one.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|not entirely free as advertised. also tries to download codecs for kindle fire hd to play videos but fails. uninstalling.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I played this game way to much. A bit sad that max score is 999990 and it stops there. Still I enjoyed a great deal.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent police procedural with an unusually interesting plot. Connelly's descriptions of the California landscape are even more evocative than usual.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Seamless and works perfectly. I have an android and a original kindle. The kindle is easier to read, but I don't carry both when on the motorcycle and this app allows me to use the more tablet when on raod.
1439130833|4.0|Thought provoking and inspirational at the least. Well worth the read. Easy read and I have been through 3 times already and plan on reading several times a year. Must believe
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use. I have input 4 locations of where family and friends live through out the west (from Texas to Oregon) and its nice to compare each at a glance. I also use on Motorcycle trips to get an idea of approaching weather.

B0015T5HKI|4.0|I read in several places that this was the best recording ever of B's #5. I'm no expert but since this was a \\"live\\" recording you can hear coughing and music sheet shuffling. Couldn't that be edited out. I wonder what the best recording in a sound studio is?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm so sad the trilogy is over,  I enjoy every<br /> Book . And I will read them again. I can deny that I love the happy endings , but  a sad ending would it be unique,for this story. Not like Katniss  or Peeta didn't deserve to have a happy life after what they went through.  But this endings sime to only happen on books or movies .
B005LAIHZY|5.0|When we first received this our granddaughter watched it three time in one day, off and on.  It's a good movie, and good for young girls to see it's not just the boys who shoot bows and arrows.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Kalinda makes the show...but everyone is great and we love it. Can't wait for the next season! Eli is also a great character...
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Not my cup of tea but our teenage daughter and her father think it's a great movie.  A little too removed from reality for me.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|So far it's great...loved the first season and this one seems slightly (???) less gruesome and more character driven. We are enjoying thus far...
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Jack Reacher at his best. Just they way you love him. Nobody's smarter than Reacher the way he thinks and puts things together would make the FBI look like clowns
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like this game, lots of twists. Very creepy line of events. Way to go Dev. Keep up the good work. These games are worth the purchase.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love the way Rick Riordan writes. He's very clever and entertaining.  I've read all the Lost Olympians and Percy Jackson novels. I hope he keeps the good stories coming.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a very amazing book to read. It's honest and heartfelt, while at the same time bit confusing. This is a great book for teenagers to read because it's easy to connect to.
0393342212|5.0|It took me 2 friends and a child psychologist before I read this and the &#34;How to Talk&#34; books.  You must have both books if you have kids or are a teacher.<br />This is the cheapest, best, and easiest help you can get.
B0034G4P4Y|3.0|Steven and I are the same age, so I was surprised when he said that -- though he'd taken French in high school -- he'd never heard of TinTin until 1981. I took Spanish, but often saw the TinTin (and Asterix) comics used in French classes laying around.<br /><br />Though this film appears to be reasonably faithful to the original, TinTin (who was obviously created as a contemporary hero for boys) just doesn't work well as a film. There are many problems translating a fundamentally unbelievable cartoon character to a fundamentally realistic medium (film), and \\"TinTin\\" suffers from many of them. *<br /><br />Though TinTin acts like an adult, he looks like a short boy who's barely halfway through adolescence. And he carries a semi-automatic pistol, which -- though obviously needed for protection -- is discomfiting. The stories -- mostly mysteries and adventures -- have little, if any, real drama (strong/important human interactions). (I'm assuming here; I haven't read the books. Tom McCarthy, a TinTin expert, would likely vigorously disagree.) There is little that would appeal to adult sensibilities. I really don't /care/ about TinTin, one way or the other.<br /><br />Spielberg said that he didn't want \\"TinTin\\" to look like \\"Indiana Jones\\" and, unfortunately, it doesn't. All the Indiana Jones films are, at some level, people stories with something more-important at stake than simply recovering an artifact. ** But in \\"TinTin\\", finding a treasure to line one's pocket is the raison d'etre of the adventure.<br /><br />The character design is terrible. TinTin becomes a believable human, but most of the other characters have their noses inflated to outrageous proportion, as if they were descended from Cyrano by way of Malden.<br /><br />Perhaps the worst thing about \\"TinTin\\" is that Steven Spielberg has succumbed to making a film that is nothing but action. Such films (eg, \\"The Mummy\\", \\"Clash of the Titans\\") are boring, because action sequences work best when they're separated by quiet moments -- especially ones with real emotion (or its filmic simulacrum). You can't ramp up the tension before you've let it fall back for a while. (See \\"Die Walkure\\", Act 1.)<br /><br />As for John Williams' score... The title music is lively and unexpected jazz, but the rest of it is the same old same-old.<br /><br />It's diffcult to recommend \\"TinTin\\" as a film you're likely to want to watch more than once. But there is one laugh-out-loud visual joke (just one, unfortunately) that borrows from another Spielberg film.<br /><br />* \\"TinTin\\" is worth seeing for Weta's startling achievement in creating photorealistic humans. They're only a stone's throw from being able to create \\"synthesbians\\" (as the writer of a \\"Popular Science\\" article put it a decade ago).<br /><br />** I recommend reading Tom McCarthy's review. I can't post a link here (Amazon will delete it), but it's footnote #81 in the Wikipedia \\"TinTin\\" article. Note particularly the paragraphs beginning with \\"But worst of all is the violence...\\" and \\"But Spielberg casts aside...\\".d by quiet moments -- especially ones with real emotion (or its filmic simulacrum).

B002RPR6DU|5.0|a must watch, one of the most overlooked films ever made, decades ahead of its time - great story, acting and effects
030758836X|1.0|It is a tradition that for Christmas I buy my mother-in-law, who is a voracious reader with a very sophisticated taste in books, bestseller books past and present. She always looks forward to them because so far I've had incredible luck picking books she has loved.<br /><br />I bought \\"Gone Girl\\" because a couple of friends recommended it, so I didn't bother reading before gifting it - mistake number one! A couple of days later I asked my mother-in-law what she thought of the book. Her exact words were: \\"it is the most dreadful, horrible book I've read but I can't put it down because I want to see what happens and if it redeems itself\\". At first I thought she was joking, but no, she wasn't. Then I got curious, how come my niece, who is a well read English teacher, and my mother-in-law, a well read and educated history major, could have such a different opinion? I read the book. The days I spent reading this book I would never get back, I am so sorry for that. It is patronizing, obscure, doesn't have one likeable character, and exploits human nature in an empty awful way. This book has no soul!<br /><br />A friend recommended reading \\"Gone Girl\\" followed by the words \\"you won't be able to put it down\\".  She was right, I could not put it down because I kept hoping to get to the part where I was not going to be able to put it down...I could not put it down because if I did I was never going to pick it up again...I could not put it down because I've never left a book half read, but if ever there was one, this should have been it. \\"Gone Girl\\" created a new standard for me: from now on if I don't like a book I am going to put it down feeling no remorse; and, next time I gift a book, I am going to read it first!<br /><br />As far as the ending is concern, if the intention of the author was to give the book a cheap horror movie wanna-be ending, congratulations!!  No originality whatsoever! I gave it one star because the option of \\"zero\\" is not available.<br /><br />Judith
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I love listening to this CD. It's one of his best efforts so far. He really pulls out all the stops here. This is a must have for Josh fans.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Software is seamless on my Nexus.  If you have an older Kindle, the commands are similar, not quite as efficient as on the Kindle Fire.  I am satisfied with this software.
B0015XASFS|5.0|When I have time, I love to put this in the player and just watch him go. Wonderful music and he has the audience with him at every note.
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|Much as I wish otherwise, this is not a great film. I find it very imaginative and the acting of Dorothy is very natural but it seems to be missing something and I can't figure out what it is. Still, Iliked it enough to buy it!
B009HEN9DU|4.0|The movie itself was good..worth watching again and the quality was great.  I was a bit disappointed that there is no disc.  I will probably not buy a movie this way again.  My family likes to pass movies around and this is just a pain to do as well as the fact thatif the web goes out for some reason there is no way to retrieve it.
B007REV4YI|5.0|this movie is unsurpassed as the the best bond film yet...daniel craig is great...superb cinematography...a must see in an imax theater...will buy on blue ray...adele's theme song is a hauntingly great masterpiece...the chemistry between actors and actresses is superb...bonds home is a fantastic picture of bonds boyhood past...can't wait for the next bond...if there were six stars this would be it....go watch it on imax it will blow you away
B004WR125O|5.0|Having a network connection allows the unit to update without having to burn a DVD.  The unit will download directly from the internet.  For me, this a timesaver and well worth the price.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|the kindle slides in really easily. and it take no effort at all to prop up. the only thing that's a little 'eh' about it is that in order to have the camera in the right position to be able to skype while it's propped up, you can't be charging it at the same time. because of the camera and the charging port being on opposite sides. but still. i love it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think the Third Wheel was excellent and an exciting book. And I never really wanted to put the kindle down so I am giving it five star but it needs more than a five stars.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|im not a big time traveling movie fan, but this one has fun with the concept. id recommend it to anyone with an open mind to movies.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read in years.  There were several places that I couldn't put it down and it really makes us think about where this world is heading.
1451620829|5.0|I purchased the book at a book signing in Eatontown, New Jersey where I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Criss. He seemed happy and a very friendly guy. Being a Kiss fan, and Peter Criss fan, for quite a while, I was excited to tear into this book and learn what really went on. I've always respected Peter's honesty and emotions toward everything that's gone on with him and grew more anxious about the book each time he said he was working on it.<br /><br />The book begins with Criss' upbringing in Brooklyn, New York where he grew up in a poor family and subjected to the gang scene of the time. Already this foreshadows the rocky road Criss would face in his life. He also talks about various pre-Kiss bands he was in and his promise to his mother he would play Madison Square Garden one day. Later, we get to the fateful meeting with Paul and Gene that would change his life. One nice thing Criss does in explaining the early Kiss days is give lots of credit to Sean Delaney and Bill Aucoin in helping them with their stage moves and getting them on the road that would make them the Hottest Band in the world. Being a drummer, much of the material Criss wrote for Kiss was discarded. Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley scoffed when producer Bob Ezrin wanted to record 'Beth', a ballad Criss had co written and sang, for the Destroyer album. Little did they know that the song would help earn the band a People's Choice Award and help make Destroyer a platinum selling album. Criss got to live out his dream in 1977 when Kiss headlined Madison Square Garden with his parents in attendance. However, as Kiss grew more popular, Criss grew more depressed. Kiss became a heavily merchandised band and Criss grew frustrated with the groups lack of focus on their music. The constant touring also led Criss to develop a heavy cocaine addiction, something that lead to his exit from the band in 1980. Criss goes into great detail about the strenuous relationship he had with his second wife and how he stayed in a mental house to kick his addictions. Criss embarked on a solo career which for the most part went nowhere and became involved in a few short lived bands, one of which featured ex-Kiss guitarist Mark St. John. Criss formed the Criss band in the 90s which toured through the US. Criss opens his book where he nearly committed suicide after an Earthquake destroyed his home and owing the IRS a large sum of money he did not have. Fate was around the corner when Criss and Ace Frehley were invited back to Kiss in 1996. The 1996/97 Reunion tour proved majorly successful but behind the scenes, not everyone was smiling. Criss, and even Frehley to an extent, was not happy with the salary rate of his new contract and felt that he was treated more as an employee than a founding member of Kiss. A few bad arguments and failed contract negotiations later, Criss was permanently out of the band by 2004. Since then he has released another failed solo effort and successfully battled breast cancer which he has helped raise awareness of. He resides in Wall Township, New Jersey with his third wive.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I respect Peter's honesty. He addresses just about everything that's been said about him. Most of it he does not deny. He comes clean of his drug addictions, failed marriages, Gene and Paul's domineering and egotistical ways, and much more. Many fans who have heard about the feuds in Kiss and stories about Peter have said 'oh he complains and cares only about himself'. Yes Peter does tend to get emotional and complain when provoked. He confesses he screwed up big time back in the band's heyday which was why he wanted desperately for the Reunion to work out. There probably is not one person he comes down harder in the book than himself! However, the book shows a good example of knowing who and who not to trust. Peter put himself in the hands of lawyers who wound up doing him wrong. When Kiss did the symphony show, Peter's attorney promised a cut of the profits from the shows CD and DVD. Did Peter get those profits? No!!!! Probably the point in the book that I find most sad was Ace coming clean about being paid more money than him, something Peter confesses is still hard to forgive him about. As far as Peter being delusional? Maybe he is, maybe he isn't. For instance, the lack of success of his solo work being because of record companies not pushing the albums and everything, I think we all know that's not entirely true. Now I am not gonna lie when I say that I actually love his solo work, Out of Control is a great album in my opinion. But with some of his material, particularly on his 2007 CD, I wont hold back in saying that his solo stuff isn't exactly Top 40 material. So maybe he's delusional in that sense. Delusional in the sense he got screwed over? Well for the most part, yeah I think he was screwed. He was Kiss' first drummer and was with them in their glory days and to be treated like an employee is wrong. Yes he screwed up first time around but he was willing to change this time. For example, a guy in his 20's cheats on his girlfriend 24/7 and she breaks up with him. Fast forward 20 years where he's happily married to someone else who he's been faithful to yet he still gets ridiculed for the crap he did when he was in his 20's. Get over it!! When Peter rejoined he wasn't an addict anymore and wanted to make the Reunion work. Some ways it did, the tour was successful, but on a personal and business level it it was not. Peter and Ace became puppets to Paul and Gene and in my personal opinion I'm glad Peter's not in Kiss anymore, Ace too. I'm a big Peter supporter and will listen to his music no matter how popular or not it is. He was a terrific drummer in his prime and I respect his love for God, his fans, and his family!! If you want to know exactly what went on with the Catman during his years in Kiss read this book!!! I quite enjoyed it!!!!
1250007208|1.0|This was one of the books I wanted to like, and absolutely hated.<br /><br />The descriptions were juvenile and left you yearning for a better description of what you were suppose to be seeing. The characters were typical yet it didn't seem like the author knew her characters. I felt like I didn't really know any of them or the reasoning for their actions. The characters and locations in this book were completely one-dimensional.<br /><br />It was an extremely easy read, but that's probably because it was so childishly written. I'm not saying I have the best vocabulary, but come on. This book getting published could be seen as an example of the dumbing down of the general population.<br /><br />I wish I hadn't read it, but if you don't mind awful descriptions, one-dimensional characters and knowing the 'twist' in the first chapter, go ahead and read it.

B007TR1R1I|5.0|This movie was absolutely marvelous! The acting is absolutely amazing, and the storyline grabs you from the beginning to the very end. There isn't a scene or a moment going by where you can't feel the aching of this movie. ...It's a bit sad and depressing, -as some might say, but that is what makes this movie so special. The sadness underlying the relationship, is what makes it so perfect. I've rarely seen films portrayed this way, and with this kind of hold on you.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this film to anyone, it is a true diamond. And by far, the best movie I've watched in a long while.

B009JBZH54|5.0|loved all three movies. great quality and very cool bonus features. i liked the making of book that came with it as well
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I didnt really know what to expect when I rented this movie. I didnt want to see a big screen Glee, but I had heard good things. I will be honest when I say that I was awestruck. It was pretty amazing. It is kind of like step up, but it doesnt take itself to seriously and it was hilarious.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I fell in love with this show after the first season.  I love the period, characters, and storyline.  Anna and Mr. Bates are my favorite.  I have only watched the first episode so I cannot fully critique Season 2, but so far I love it.  I'm already recording Season 3 on my DVR so I need to hurry up and finish watching Season 2!
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Bought it for my father in law, He loves the beatles so I bought every CD he wanted. I could only imagine it was amazing.
0307742997|5.0|The crime was solved several times before it was actually solved.<br />Riveting!! Can't wait to read another of his books soon.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|Bought it for my father in law, He loves the beatles so I bought every CD he wanted. I could only imagine it was amazing.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a really great game if you like Mahjong.  It's more complicated which causes you to use a little more &#34;brain power&#34; than with the usual Mahjong.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Got to the 90+ level and giving it up. I was already tired of the nonsense of special coins being set up to fall off the sides most times but the clincher came when it allowed the ferris wheel to fall off TWICE after I nurtured it along.<br /><br />Regular coins fall off at a great rate as well. Perhaps a couple dozen or more for every coin that makes it 'home'. Yep I purchased coins a couple times. Shocker to see your money literally pouring off the edge...<br /><br />Some fun moments but unfortunately the frustrations have overshadowed them.
B00062IDCO|5.0|My friend is a star trek fan, he really like this. He has been trying to get this for a while.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|Don't fall asleep watching this or you will be REALLY confused.  Very interesting movie - watched it twice I liked it so much.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case is a counterfeit...DO NOT BUY IT!! This was confirmed by Lifeproof company with the serial number on the case.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Bought this with birthday money and LOVE IT!  I love all of Mumford & Sons cds.  Good price too!  Thanks.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It seems as if the writer was pressed to finish. In my opinion, could have been better done. I could go on to say more, but chose not to. Overall, I enjoyed it.... enough said.
160094048X|5.0|I am not a Vegan by any means, but this cookies are the best I have ever tried in my entire life!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I wanted to like this movie -- I love to laugh, and I'm a sucker for romantic films.  Simply put, there was nothing fun about this movie.
B004IFGORQ|4.0|Aside from Sandler being great, the movie sends a good message.<br />The storyline has a good flow and our kids always enjoy seeing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is sssoooooooo gooooodddd but guess what I bet my score is highest 32868. lets see who's is highest in the comments!!
B0086700CM|2.0|I thought there would be more to it. Action, adventure, or intrigue.  This game does not stimulate  my synapses enough to keep me from drooling on my kindle.
B005VPRET4|3.0|Very disappointing to see the minimal number of Lego bricks required to put this product together.  The age group for which it is intended will not be challenged and will soon tire of the simplistic construction.  I believe the product is way overpriced and doesn't meet expectations of the cost.
034580404X|5.0|Awesome series!  I read on nook because Kindle was out! (how is that possible with ebooks?) I bought these in real book form for a friend's Christmas present and they showed up early! In time for me to give at Christmas. Thank you!! And she can't put them down!!!
B009O2XY12|5.0|Lot's fun to play real fast game..Love the brite colors.Like the different screens.Time flys buy when playing this game.Lot's fun.
0894803123|5.0|The book is a MUST HAVE if you make ice cream at home. It is more than just recipes; it really explains a great deal about the ice cream making process and Ben and Jerry's own trials and errors so that you learn quite a bit. The recipes I have tried have come out fantastic.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lot's different screens to play. Real good fast game. Have played on face book so thouhgt I would like the game for the kindle fire.
0345804538|5.0|im happy with the order. i would recommend it to anyone who like to read biographies. u will love this book.
B009P5S11G|5.0|This is a good cd it's not like her others but if you're a fan then you should still add to your collection. Its Rhianna and if you love her music then get this cd. It may not be like her last cd but I like it anyway because I like her music.
0061726834|5.0|Almost eighteen, Lena is ready for her procedure. She can't wait to get it over with, to be normal, to be cured. Who wants to risk being infected by a boy and getting the disease? Just look what it did to her mother, jumping off the cliff when Lena was only 6. Leaving her and her older sister to be raised by her aunt and uncle. Lena's friend Hana though is little more defying and wants a taste at some things the uncured do before she has her procedure. Lena never expected to meet him, Alex, the cured security gaurd at the labs. He was there when she had her evaluations and now he is on her mind. He isn't supposed to be, he is not on her match list but he is the one she wants. Lena must decide if she will risk everything to be with him, to run to the wilds, to be infected like her mother and leave it all behind.
B008J34466|3.0|Although I am not a big Pink fan, I felt that this cd was a let down from The Playhouse or whatever her last cd was. I have only listened to this once and I wasn't impressed, I want the pink of old days. I want the rocker Pink that cursed and slung profanity like a boomerang, I know that artists grow and change but don't loose what your fans have come accustomed to. It's just okay to me, not sure if I'll purchase another Pink cd after this though.
006197806X|5.0|It wasn't supposed to be this way. She chose to live, she chose to be uncured, to run to the Wilds with Alex. Now she is alone with strangers in the Wild and all she can think about is Alex covered in blood on the other side of the fence. He was supposed to come with her. Her fear and grief soon turn to anger and vengence as she learns the ways of the Wild from Raven, Tack, Hunter, and the others in the compound. She joins the resistance vowing to do her part to help bring down the regulators, the cured, the DFA. All those who took her mother and Alex away from her. Julian, the DFA leaders son is her mission to watch and observe but when the scavengers show up at the rally and nearly killer her and Julian, they are running together and kidnapped. Now she must join with the him in order to escape and she begins to show him how to live and be free and uncured. She shouldn't be having feelings for him though, he is the enemy, he is NOT Alex, and yet she learns to let go and begin again when a familiar face shows up.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|So far I have read every book that Ms. Reichs has written and have enjoyed each and every one of them.  I look forward to her next book.  It can not come out fast enough for me.
B004DM0UII|1.0|I tried to run it, but it didn't work. I don' know if I was doing something wrong or what, but it just didn't work.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a wonderful addition to Fifty Shades of Gray.  Went on to read the third in the series.  They were all great.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good til the last drop<br />Sad it's over.....<br />Want more to read like this, what can we expect from the unexpected!?!?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a very good book.  I did not want it to end.  Hope it will continue someday.  The whole series was a great read.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I especially like this version because you can complete the levels.  It was fun to watch the Christmas bird levels reveal one everyday.  I had so much fun with this one.
B007V65R54|4.0|Good<br />book, very interesting. Silver deftly navigates between being too nuanced to comprehend and too broad to be of use. I, personally, would have liked to have seen more of the math he used in developing his models, rather than his explanations for why we shouldn't trust political pundits or believe fringe theories on earthquakes. Still, a good read.
B005LAII12|5.0|I went 2 see the movie in theaters the day it came out & I said that I would get it for a friend I really like, and it's on it's way. . .next time I am going to order it for myself.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app lets me know how much time I have to video chat and how much time I have to listen to my favorite music.
0307887448|5.0|First I should say, I am a child of the 80's and I love video games.  Therefore, it seems that this book was written for me personally.  I got all of the references and it brought back a lot of memories.  If you are anything like me, you should begin reading this book immediately.  If 80's video game culture is not your thing, you will still find a great story here, but I figure it would be a 3 or 4 star book for you.  This will make an amazing movie, where people can see the references that they may not be familiar with.  For me this is one of the best books I have ever read, but it is certainly in my wheelhouse.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|My youngest sister is a huge 1 Direction fan and I knew that she would love this. I was right. She was speechless when she opened it. Definitely worth buying it just for the look on her face.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I love this book and you will find that the most common type of person is the third one picked out of one hundred
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I looked all over town for this for my husband. Couldn't find it and was pretty upset. I found it here and literally cheered. Got it as a gift for my husband and it was perfect.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was one of the best books in the series. Hopefully they make more Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, there one of the only books I have an interest for.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Would have given 5 stars if I could save an edited Excel file but no such luck. Very nice interface but not very good if you cannot make edits.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game ever it is easy to use because sometimes I has a bunch of glitches and then I mess up
B000L53D4O|5.0|My grandson got this for Christmas.  After playing with it on the floor for two weeks he decided it was time to walk with it.  Off to the races we go.
B00ARAO720|4.0|This is a great fun movie, specially if you like bikes. Great for a Sunday afternoon. Only 4 stars because of the Holliwood predicatble ending.<br />This won't change your life, or start a conversation. Good entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app so much. I like how you do not need to really buy anything too. It is really easy to get cions and get new things and people by earning it. The only thing I do not like is that is that when ur character is running it is a little hard to hold the KINDLE FIRE because it is a little big.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I echo the sentiments and observations of all those who did not like this book.<br />I have closed it on page 243 and cannot bear the torture, and NO I don't know how it ends nor do I care.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I LOVE READING NOVELS FROM THE ANTEBELLUM PERIOD. THIS BOOK &#34;THE KITCHEN HOUSE &#34; WAS A A GREAT FAST READ.  i would love to read more bokks like this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Literally couldn't put it down. Read this book cover to cover in two days. Best book I've read in years.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great plot...Great characters.....a page turner!! Michael Connelly has done it again. Looking forward to his next book already. I'm sure I will pre-order it the moment it's available!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As expected, like every other Grisham novel this was entertaining and hard to put down. While he fesses up in the author's note to not doing too much research for this book, it doesn't seem to make a difference.
B00ARAOBKS|4.0|I like Matthew McConaughey in most anything, but he is particularly good in this movie. It was interesting to see the &#34;Thin Blue Line&#34; drawn so fine, his character is both a cop and a hitman. Alternately I loved and hated (mostly hated) each character in turn and couldn't wait to see how it turned out. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the ending. A lot of people will love how it turns out. I did not.
0765325950|1.0|Postponing the release date of the kindle version was a poor decision on the publisher's part;  it is obvious that they are more interested in milking some short-term cash.  That is their prerogative.  Maybe they will come to see the \\"light\\" when this move ends up costing them more in the long run, because, like it or not, Amazon's star ratings influence sales.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|This remake of the original is well done, and keeps the same Christmas Spirit.  Good movie for familes to watch.
B00A77II0U|5.0|this game was very well done. it wasn't too hard and was fun to play. story wasn't overdone or lenghty. it is worth your money!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Great app for a great service. I use it all the time and recommend everyone give it a try. Well worth the time and effort.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Wonderful story and true from what I understand. Very  intense but a good movie. We need more movies like this instead Blood, Guts, and Gore
B004JK61K0|5.0|I was looking for an email client and came across K-9 Mail and thought I would give it a try. Product is easy and useful and I recommend it.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|I am not into a lot of war movies but this on was very intense. Acting was good so ok
0765325950|4.0|Still processing, but in general, I'm fairly pleased.  I started the series when the fourth book came out (when I was 12) and I'm 32 now, so, like many, I've been reading for about 20 years (over half my life).  It's hard to believe that the end is finally here.  So, I was quite gratified that my pre-ordered copy arrived on Jan. 7, the day before the release date, and was only $20 with free 2-day shipping with my husband's Amazon Prime account.  Also, this way I can share it with everyone in my family who wants to read it and is willing to wait for it.  To me, all that makes up for the fact that it's not out on Kindle yet.  Although yes, that IS really annoying.<br /><br />Anyway, I was glad to get back to chapters that I knew Robert Jordan wrote.  Nothing against Sanderson, but I think it was a mistake that he chose not to imitate RJ's writing style, especially since he threw in what I think a lot of readers agree was a bunch of unnecessary filler.  (And no writing style is inimitable.)  I still also believe that it all really could have been consolidated into the twelfth book, which should have concluded the series.  All this talk of doing the series justice by expanding it was pretty lame, in my view.  They should have just gone with what RJ had.  I'm glad, however, to know that the series ended the way he wanted it ended.  That being said, I REALLY wish that we could have found out more about what happened in the end.  I mean, we're talking about 14 humungous books leading up to the Last Battle, and they can't give us a little more about what happened after?!  An expanded epilogue, with maybe some writings from Loial?  I was especially curious about Rand's babies.  Basically, it makes it look like he's going to be an absent father and he's not that interested in them.  Does Mat go to live in the Empire?  Do the Black Tower and White Tower unify?  Etc.<br /><br />Anyway onto a spoiler...<br /><br />***Stop reading now if you don't want to know what happens***<br/><br />Egwene and Gawyn?  WTH?!  I'm thrilled.  Someone had to die off, and they were annoying me (Egwene especially--she was so self-satisfied), so I'm glad it was they.  And I know this goes for practically all of the main characters in the book, but for some reason it especially annoyed me with Egwene: the woman's, like, in her late teens, and she's supposed to be in this position of authority, helping to save the world?  Pfft.  Puh-leeze.<br /><br />My only other complaint is also about the series in general, and that's the generalizations it makes about the characteristics of the different sexes.  I know in some ways, the series is feminist because it has women in charge of some things, but in my opinion the generalizations (so-and-so would never figure out women, did they learn these looks in the cradle, men are lazy if you let them be, etc.) are another form of sexism.<br /><br />But, all in all, a fitting conclusion to a great (although too-long) series.  I'm glad it's over.
B003ELKNH2|4.0|Very pleased with saw the origianl but had to get this on DVD. Glad they redid the film  Thank you
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|pretty dumb... it's a guy's movie... girls, drugs, guns... I  am not a guy and didn't enjoy it but my husband thought it was okay.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Was a great movie and happy with the story finally being told about some our brave military men. They deserve the respect I am white but feel they finally got there Honor
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|cannot believe this is free. it does anything that you can think of and is just what I was looking for!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It is entertaining but same thing over and over and over and over and over and over. You get the point  Story a little boring
B0090SI460|5.0|We have not received this set as of yet but are so excited as we await it.  This is one of my favorite and in the #D we know it is going to be worth every penny.
1451695187|5.0|It was to my expectation!  I would recommend this book to anyone in search of a true meaning in life after death.
B003MX5P20|3.0|I love some of the song but others are more like night club songs for dancing; so if you listen to the CD in the morning in the car  you don't really enjoy the beat as early int he day. I love thou &#34;Cuando me enamoro&#34;, &#34;No  me digas que no&#34; &#34;Tu y Yo&#34; Y &#34;Dile&#34;.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was a quick, easy and  fun book to read for just relaxing with a cup of coffee.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Great show. Watched all the episodes in one night because I couldn't wait to see what happened next it was such a great show. Can't wait for season two to come out! Delivery was on time and the price was affordable.
0061367036|4.0|I got this book at the same time as &#34;Bobby Singer's.....&#34; book and just like that one I skimmed it and it looks like it's gonna be good reading.
B009MO5960|5.0|I enjoy these movies because there is a lot of action.  I thought the story line was good, We just got a blue ray player and this movie was great to watch.
0062073192|4.0|Received this book with the other two I oredered and skimmed it just like the other two.  Also looks like good reading, Can't wait!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|community is one of my favorite television series. it is hilarious, quirky, and creative. i have no complaints about any of the seasons.
0062103377|4.0|I just receved it and I am so excited.  I can't wait to read it!  I skimmed it and it looks like it's gonna be fun reading.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|You make money too slow!! Because of that, it takes too long to do anything, which is pretty frustrating. Still, passes the time
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Mr. Alexander comes across as arrogant and ignorant at the same time in this ridiculous claim of TRUTH.  He expects readers to believe him simply because he has M.D. after his name.  Admittedly, that is what initially drew me to the book... hoping that an educated, informed, logical individual could provide me with actual proof of an afterlife.  Aside from his sketchy description, and his debateable claim (over and over) that his brain was completely nonfunctional, he gives no proof.  I think that this book would provide further &#34;proof&#34; for people who already believe in an afterlife, but for those of us with a healthy skepticism, this book is near worthless.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I LOVE this app. This game is super creative and fun. They are also multiple objectives embedded in each level so when you complete one part, you can go back t to find missing pages or puzzles pieces. If I had all day, I could play this game for hours!
1452110581|5.0|Belly-laugh-inducing collection of poems &#34;from&#34; or &#34;by&#34; cats.  A must-read for all cat owners who wonder what could possibly be going through their cats' minds.
B007QWFBAE|5.0|always loved ABBA since the mid 70's. All the deluxe packaged cds they put out are great, including this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is a fantastic book for readers who like adventure. I don`t 'recommend this book to readers that are not well with gruesome books.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is great kindle needs more like this just make sure you have a little real money on hand you will need it
B006O3MU96|1.0|Cannot get this to make sense.  Wouldn't have even given it one star if there was an option for none.
B007HO392S|5.0|One of country musics hit makers released a new great album, She is by far the best of all the American Idol contestants. cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy
0765325950|5.0|This book has been amazing so far. I'm dismayed to see a bunch of emotionally charged posts downgrading the rating of this amazing story--not because of the virtue of the book itself, but because the reviewers didn't get their way.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv right now I only wish they would run a longer season.
0871404133|5.0|It is really an amazing book<br />A must for anyone that wants to understand mankind and the our we have evolved
B0065CCM76|5.0|In my opinion the greatest rock singer of all time released a great album with all of his classic songs, cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Still enjoyed book even though I read it after having seen the movie. Good writing--keeps the reader interested and wanting more.
B0018CENUC|5.0|One of country musics hit makers released a great album with all of his classic songs, cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy
B0085TKAW6|5.0|A joy to read - I took it on holidays and didn't want it - or the holiday - to end! So easy to read on the Kindle too - a big book that I didn't have to lug around. Follett weaves tales of intrigue with detail that make them feel so real. Can't wait for his next offering.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I had a hard time putting this one down! I plan on buying her next one.  Awesome book read it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Runs well on my Fire.  Gifting needs to be improved though. Rarely do gifts from team mates show up and forget sending gifts.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|How do I rate this if I don't know what/which MP3 I'm rating, LOL. I guess I'll say that Amazon's MP3 marketplace and setup is very nice.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is an amazing tale of one way humanity came to become what it is today through the science and play of running. All runners and athletes should read this as a testament to creation and using your body in the way it was designed. I especially liked the balance of narrative and expose intermingled in this book to give it's points the potency they deserve and the morals the reflection they deserve
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I enjoyed Prometheus as a weekender movie for my wife and I. Some things were way to predictable, and the cast could have been MUCH better. I'd say rent this for a few bucks and toss back some popcorn or whatever you enjoy.<br /><br />Too bad they didn't push the alien thing more...I think they could have done much better with the action/fear aspect.
B009AMAMF2|5.0|This movie deserves a throne in every movie goer's collection. Never before has the span of human emotion been as intertwined and beautifully orchestrated as was demonstrated in this masterpiece. Honestly, the critics out there that are saying this film is overreaching or even boring need to stop critiquing; they are revealing their inadequacies in comprehension and retention.<br />There is a lot more gore than I expected but i felt like feeling the horror was necessary to deserve to experience the beautiful. When you watch this film, be prepared for an epic. Don't add this to your &#34;lets play games while we watch a movie&#34; list; missing the tiniest transition or scene may bring tons of confusion. If you give this movie your fullest attention, you will be significantly rewarded. If you get confused, or upset at the end of this film, just know that whatever feeling you have should remind you that this film accomplished something; it made you feel human.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|My wife and I went into the movie not expecting much. Because of this, I think we both really enjoyed it. We liked the music, we both got some good laughs, and we both sang/rocked right along with the film.<br /><br />I'd recommend it for a fun watch with friends or your loved one and for those that aren't strict on the quality of their movie watching.<br /><br />Good, fun stuff.
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|The basic story-line is good. The acting is average. Most of the sex and horror do not advance the story. Sex and violence for the sake of sex and violence.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Absolutely excellent movie.<br /><br />I may actually have to buy the blu-ray of this movie. I've basically quit buying movies and just rent/stream them. However, I'd love to see the blu-ray copy and hear it crystal clear through my surround sound.<br /><br />Very well made, well acted, and well paced. A good long movie that doesn't disappoint.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie wasn't great, but it was good for a few laughs and time with my wife (who picked it out).<br /><br />If only our toys really could have come alive. :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this game is so amazing get it I love it so much its so fun!!!!  well it's like star wars but that does not mean<br />it is a bad game you'd like it so so much.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I was honestly surprised at how well they did with this third installment. The third time was the charm for MIB and I'm glad I watched.<br /><br />Really enjoyed the &#34;twist&#34; near the end. Well done.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|The story was slow at first. Then picked up as I continued reading. The ending was perfect. Nikki Heat is smart, tough, playful with no nonsense.  Thoroughly enjoyed.
1423124960|3.0|One of my books had a page ripped in half. (ordered two)<br /><br />I ended up trashing/tossing the 2nd book (not worth returning) and eating the cost. The 1st book in the box, however, was in perfect condition. My 5 year old loves it!<br /><br />I recommend the book...I just hope yours isn't damaged.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Again, what can I say...except for another book please, Ms. Flynn!  I have a very few number of authors that I will buy when a book is first released - (because I'm cheap!) - and Ms. Flynn is now on that list.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|My wife, 5 year old, and myself watched this together. I like the fact that they tried something a little different in this installment. Nothing ground breaking or awe-inspiring, but it's worth a rental and some fun laughs with your kids.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have the free version and this is a great app for my Kindle Fire.  I use it every day!
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|I downloaded this for my grandchildren.  They really like it.  I realize with age you are suposed to get better but, not in this game.  I can't move the obistals fast enought and have not got an perfect score yet.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I truly love Gillian Flynn...my first read was The Gone Girl which I loved.  Really enjoyed her style of writing in that book, and this one is another great read.  I was sad to put it down...Ms. Flynn is intelligent in her writing, yet writes in a way that almost feels like someone is telling a story in person - not as a written book.  I love that in a book; I really enjoy reading a book that leaves me feeling like I had a great conversation with a friend.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|We put off buying this lego until our kids were grown; mostly because of the number of pieces and the cost.  Santa brought it as a family gift this year and all I can say is we had more fun building this lego together than we have had in a while.  Well worth every penny!  Even with 4 &#34;adults&#34; working, it took several days to complete.  We had quality time together talking about other legos we had built over the years, the ingenuity of the designers of the Death Star, the Star Wars characters etc.  The most popular phrase was &#34;this is soooo cool!&#34;.  Definitely made for the experienced builder.  Our 20 something kids were sometimes challenged but that was half the fun.  Would highly recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Every time I took a break from the book I looked forward to going back to it. Enjoyed the story, characters and (spoiler alert!) the happier ending that is usually missing from Nicholas Sparks books.
B003VANOFY|5.0|No cons yet, got these for 2 months<br />Good sound, great mic, wi fi works perfect.<br />The range is pretty good also
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was a little on the dirty side rather than just being funny like I expected the movie to be. If I would have known it was going to be like that, I would have purchased it.
B000G6R7B8|4.0|This is a very easy to read watch that performs perfectly. The band is very comfortable and even fit a smaller size wrist without unnecessary overlap. Its is a BIG plus that no battery is needed.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband this year and he loved it. So nice to have all the movies in one compact case instead of several different cases. I would recommend to anyone that is a Rocky fan.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book I think it is the best of all of the books. Jeff Kinney really out did himself this time
B0031RS8UI|4.0|This is a fun read.  Like all her books, its well written and entertaining. The characters are easy to like and understand.  There is a pretty good twist at the end promising a bit of suspense.  It ends in the usual way--it is consistent and fun.  If you like Kinsella's other work, this will not disappoint.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has had me captivated from start to finish I cant wait to read the last chapter I love a good romance and mint sex and this book holds both
B0064BWE8U|4.0|This is another Kinsella work harldy unique from her other work.  But it delivers; its funny, straight forward, and easy to read.  If you read most of her other work already, this one will not disappoint, albeit, the formula does get tired after a while.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A really good book! You should read this. Great storyline. But now I have to wait until fall for the next book...
075669812X|5.0|A must have for all ninjago lovers. The book is well made with nice and glossy pages. The special edition Lloyd character is a great bonus
B004J4WN0I|3.0|The subject matter and tone are strongly reminiscent of Butcher's Harry Dresden, but with a druid instead of a wizard.  It's a straightforward action adventure, with some nice touches but not a lot of depth.  Good for light reading in an airport.<br /><br />The only thing that elevates this from the grasping claws of mediocrity is the protagonist's companion, an Irish wolfhound named Oberon.  Their (mind-linked) conversations are hilarious.  Not quite enough to push this out of three-star territory.<br /><br />On the whole I enjoyed reading it, but don't plan to continue with the series.
0802798225|5.0|I don't read a lot of traditionally published books because they are expensive and I normally just don't have time between all the indie review books but I had my eye on this one for forever and it went on sale. I grabbed it so fast, and I was ecstatic that I would finally get to see Simone's writing.<br />Perfect Chemistry met all my expectations. This is one I read without reading the description so I went in completely blind to what it was about besides there was romance.<br />I loved the writing! You can tell that Simone payed a lot of attention to the Latin-American Culture when describing Alex's world. It is sprinkled with Spanish words which really got me in the mindset of Alex and how he would actually think and speak. For the most part I could tell what he was saying. I also loved how she wrote this in alternating point of views. It gave me a chance to get into both Alex's and Brittany's mindset and to really understand their struggle.<br />The romance was great. It's between the misunderstood hot guy with the image of a bad ass and the beautiful girl whose life isn't as perfect as everyone thinks it is. Both of them are putting up a facade and my favorite part of the book is when they start letting each other get a glimpse into the real them.<br />They both have a reason that makes it near impossible to be together which makes it a big struggle for the relationship to start. They give something for readers to root for.<br />I would for sure recommend this book to any fans of the YA Romance Genre! It was an awesome read!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a gripping series, full of surprises, and full of suspense!<br />Great acting and great writing.  Highly recommend it.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|The product was as described and the family I gave it to, loved it. Thanks. The product arrived early which was awesome.
B002APU580|5.0|Very very good, but not quiet as good as the British version we saw years ago with Colin Firth. Of course that one was at least 6 hours long and very detailed.
0061733199|5.0|I love this book for the fact that it includes sections on plants, in addition to everything else. Would recommend to a friend.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is written in the language of its day and is very enjoyable as a light read. If you've never read and like old fashioned romantic books this is a good one.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|The cards are durable and stand up to some tough college dorm games already and soda was spilt over the table and the cards weren't ruins, just threw them in the sink and washed them.  Good investment.  And as a colorblind person it is easier for me to see the cards and the colors
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This movie made me laugh and cry, truly; I think it is because I found so much familiar in this story, in the characters, in the way they relate to each other.  I think couples who have been married for 20-30 years need to see this movie.  I found it inspiring and heart warming.  Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep were amazing!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|very fun rpg in which you can play online fights or offline fights and strategy based. worth more than free for sure.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|How am I supposed to wait for the next one?? They are all very good but Wool is by far the best installment
B004U52VPS|4.0|Got this as a Christmas gift for my seven year old nephew.  He loved it!  Great value & shipped quickly!
B008XNZMOU|1.0|The title says it all. It's almost unbearable to listen to some of the songs. I am very surprised these are actually from her considering that I love her \\"Speak Now\\" album.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The sex scenes I skimmed over after a while, but the background stories for the characters is what I liked most.  I heard she's coming out with a book written from the other main character's perspective and I can not wait.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|really boring for me because I like action games and if your like me than I don't recommend this game for you.  I hope everyone else enjoys the game
B00846REIS|3.0|It was recommended after 50 Shades so I bought it.  Its a quick read and not bad...just didn't get me drawn in like 50 did.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I have loved this Tv show from the beginning. If you like cop shows than you will love Hawaii 5-0.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this book because it has the hunting and survival aspect for my boys and the romance or rather nomance for my girls.
B008518MOW|5.0|All around fun movie with great 3D popping at you...lot's of awesome special effects. This movie is a must see
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Tired of Grisham's same ole same ole. Read 1  Grisham and you have read them all.<br />Boring, Boring, and more Boring.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this app!!!! I am not a huge fan of apps usually and I never spend money on  them but I broke my own rule on this one and do not regret it one bit!!! This game is so awesome and a great way to see just how dangerous and serious these scenarios can be. After playing this I have so much more respect for the CDC. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to learn more about diseases and how they work.
B000W07EKW|5.0|great.  these are movies i can watch over and over all weekend long.  this box set is awesome and will get lots of play
B0086700CM|5.0|I play it all the time. It's great to work your mind and how fast you can react to each action.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great movie that had a little bit of everything. It can make you laugh, cry and had plenty of action for those that need it. But most of all it had a great message. Seller was really good also.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this app it has stations I love  and so far has always been accessible. Being able to record these songs is a plus.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Couldn't have asked for a better deal. All 3 movies cost only 2.00 more than just buying the 3rd movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I have not seen the movie before so it was an even better reading experience. Just couldn't stop!
0786955570|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Christmas. We played the 2nd campaign (first coop) and were hooked! I'm excited to see there are a bunch of adventures and so many different ways to play. It'll keep us entertained until next holiday!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love the acting, phenomenal performances by Jessica Lange, James Cromwell, Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson. Original scary story that brings out lots of emotions. You never get bored.
B002E66C6E|4.0|Exciting action with a bit of history thrown in. Always fun to watch these WWII movies to remember what we never want to have to re-live.
B0049J0CTM|4.0|My daughters and I finally saw this for the first time.  Sweet story and compelling characters in animation that holds up even to today's standards.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great character interaction. Teams always storm when they are forming, and these guys end up performing at a high level. My favorite part has to be the Hulk schooling Loki. Makes me laugh every time I see it.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I bought this movie as a gift for my son for Christmas...it was used, but you wouldn't be able to tell by looking at it.  That made me extremely happy.  The movie itself was a great view and my son loves it.  Happy with this purchase!
B008NB0SQO|5.0|It is always nice when a classic is re-released on Blu-ray disc. Gonzo and Rizzo are great together. Too bad they took out the song.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|We can learn more about cultures and times in history through books like this.<br /><br />The author wrote with pen and ink but we get a digital copy with an index.<br /><br />This is a bargain.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is exactly what I wanted and needed to read this summer.  It is written as a personal account of an amazing journey many wouldn't survive.  I highly recommend it for your reading pleasure.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and tried to find it years ago but couldn't...i'm glad its on dvd now :)
B0086700CM|5.0|My nephew had played this game before and specifically asked for it. I got it since it seems like a game that is challenging.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|Great Kindle Reader version. The illustrations are perfect to help visualize the story. You cannot beat the classics for a quiet read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Since kids seem to know all about Angry Birds, I thought they would enjoy exploring and playing with this game
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|You shouldn't have to pay money for peanuts a free game should be free charge an up front fee or a single flat fee if anything
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liked the option of having a bunch of games for the kids to try, especially when they say they are bored.
0765325950|3.0|You people are all hilarious. Half of you complaining there's no e-book and giving one stars and half of you complaining about the 1 star ratings and countering with five stars. Congratulations for the people that read the book and actually wrote a review. While it may turn out to be a five star book, does anyone posting here really think that a rating makes that much difference at this point in the game? It's the last book in a great series, no one is going to look it up and say \\"hmm, I need a new book to read. I'd like to read the last book in a lengthy series but it only averaged 2 stars. Maybe if it was five stars I'd start reading the series at the end but not for 2 stars.\\" Or maybe they think it will be a case of someone buying every other book and then not buying the last one because it only got two stars? Was it an error to alienate a large part of the fan base? Sure. Is giving it 1 star going to influence the publisher to stop doing it or move the kindle release up? Maybe. If it works I'm all for it.<br />I live in Northern Labrador and I don't think there's a book store within several hundred kilometers that would have had the hard copy on day 1. I can order online and Amazon may get it here in two weeks. I have been a big fan for a long time and I've waited years for this book like everyone else. I'll wait three months, buy it on kindle and read it at my leisure. Maybe the rest of my friends will be able to discuss the book without me. I'm a bog boy, I'll get over it. As for the ratings war, get over it. Stars don't matter, only the quality of the book. Publishers respond to dollars in their pockets, hit them there, not on Amazon book reviews.<br />I gave it three stars so I wouldn't take sides. I'll review it again when I read it in three months.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Challenging and cute. Looking forward to more levels. I couldn't stop playing. I hope to open my fridge and find my pudding looking back at me.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Item arrived still in plastic wrapping in expected time frame. Excellent find for the price I paid. It was less expensive than buying the DVDs.
0345803507|5.0|I had the hardcover for Fifty Shades.  Couldn't wait for the shipment of the second installment and had to download!  When downloading, I also ordered the final book in this series!
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Read this and other reviews at [...]<br /><br />First - if you haven't read Delirium, stop what you're doing and go buy this book IMMEDIATELY. Oh, and stop reading this review. While it doesn't have spoilers per se, you need to read book 1, before you starting reading reviews for book 2. So quit getting ahead of yourself. And go read Delirium. Now. In terms of Pandemonium, there's really only word that comes to mind: BRILLIANT. This story was so different from Delirium, in the best ways possible, but it was no less amazing. I was still left completely floored. Even now a couple days later, I can't stop thinking about this book and it's basically killing me to not be able to read Requiem right now.<br /><br />The second I finished Delirium, I got on Amazon and downloaded Pandemonium. There was no chance I was going to be able to wait to see what happened. I NEEDED ANSWERS. This book is so much different because it's told in the \\"then\\" and the \\"now.\\" The \\"now\\" is 6 months later after Lena has been in the Wilds and built a new life for herself entirely...in New York. When I first started reading, I thought I would really hate the \\"now\\" because I just wanted the old Lena back, and in fact, I just wanted Delirium back entirely. If you've read it...then you KNOW what I'm talking about. I just wanted to go back in time and fix it all. So at first, I felt like a petulant child stomping my feet, saying, \\"but I don't care what she's doing NOW, go back to THEN.\\" I was sad, sometimes to the point of crying, at any mention of Alex, and I just didn't know how I could even come to like this story. But I did. So much.<br /><br />{{We all need mantras, I guess-stories we tell ourselves to keep us going.}}<br /><br />Without giving too much away, Lena was found in the Wilds - after her escape from Portland - by a girl named Raven. She goes back to their homestead and spends quite a bit of time recovering...from running over 60 miles before she almost died. She's not sure she even wants to be alive anymore. After the escape. After Alex. She just doesn't know how she'll go on. But Raven demands it of her. And in time, Lena gets stronger and learns to survive in the Wilds - and learns about joining the movement. In the \\"now\\" portions of the story, we see Lena integrated into life in New York City, as a \\"cured\\" - while really serving as almost a double agent against the DFA (Deliria Free America) - against the President of the organization, Thomas Fineman - and his son, the leader of the youth division Julian.<br /><br />During a DFA Rally, an attack takes place by Scavengers - uncureds who are just out of their freaking minds. This is where the story gets CRAZY. And I can't say anything about it. It must all be experienced firsthand, because it will blow you away. I will say, I REALLY did not want to like Julian. At all. But I couldn't help it. He grew on me. And even though it felt wrong and like I was cheating on my beloved Alex, I couldn't help but fall for Julian. Just a little. He's still not Alex. But he works for me, as Julian.<br /><br />{{It occurs to me, then, that people themselves are full of tunnels: winding, dark spaces and caverns; impossible to know all the places inside of them. Impossible even to imagine.}}<br /><br />There were so many unanswered questions at the end of Delirium - regarding Alex, Lena's mother, Lena's fate. All of it. There are plenty of questions answered during Pandemonium, but at the same time, there are just as many questions raised. Never did I feel like this was the typical filler book in the series, which is usually how second books can feel. There was just enough tension and bomb dropping, that just when I thought I could take a break, I would find myself 5 more chapters in, and completely enthralled. Lauren is such a magnificently skilled writer, in the sense that she knows how to dangle that carrot and make you complacently hop along, having NO idea you're about to have your world rocked. This could not be more true for even the last 7-8 pages of Pandemonium. OMG.<br /><br />Of course, this was a 5 star read for me. Again, the storyline was completely captivating and the characters were just as amazing as ever. I loved the introduction of all the supporting characters Lena met while living in the Wilds. Of course, meeting Julian and figuring out a part of his story. I literally CANNOT wait until March for Requiem to be released. While the title makes me incredibly nervous, I'm still looking forward to seeing how the series wraps up. Although, I will certainly be sad to see it end. I still have to read the couple novellas that are out as well, Hana and Annabel. I know that Raven is also being released on the same day as Requiem. I look forward to getting into these ladies' heads a bit more too. And just getting to experience more of this world. And Lauren's writing. If you haven't read these yet, PLEASE do yourself the greatest favor, and pick them up. Even if you don't like dystopian. Or young adult. I beg of you. You will be forever changed.<br /><br />{{In approved places, every story serves a purpose. But forbidden books are so much more. Some of them are webs; you can feel your way along their threads, but just barely into strange and dark corners. Some of them are balloons bobbing up through the sky: totally self-contained, and unreachable, but beautiful to watch. And some of them-the best ones-are doors.}}m. OMG.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!  My son orginally downloaded it for me so I would stop playing another game so much!<br />I play all the time!
B007SGM084|4.0|I decided to read these books last summer after hearing over and over how amazing and addicting they were. It took me awhile to get into the first one, as I felt it lacked enough of a storyline to keep me interested. However, I knew what I was getting into from all the hype when I started this series, so I kept reading. I ended up enjoying the second and third books more than the first and was happy I read these books overall.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun app!  Even though a lot of my original players dropped out, I still have a few dedicated players that I continue playing with!
B005723JSQ|5.0|My mom turned me onto Sophie Kinsella with &#34;Can You Keep A Secret?&#34; and I keep coming back for more! I find myself often laughing out loud when reading her books and this one is no exception.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had to have it and couldn't wait for the hard copy!  I downloaded it as soon as I was finished the first book.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters when it came out years ago and really enjoyed it. My husband recently saw part of it while flipping through channels on TV and wanted to watch it, but Netflix streaming didn't have it available at that time and we don't have the DVD mail service anymore. Redbox didn't have it either so I came to Amazon since I have Prime and found this for a good price. A couple of days later, it was here and we got to watch it and have watched it another time since. Good movie and good service from Amazon!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Anyone would love this game its  very entertaining n very realistic. my daughter and I love playing this game together. its cute and this game allows you  to do things like we do in the real world.
0679805273|5.0|I remember this book from when I was a child and still love Dr. Suess! I saw the idea on Pinterest to have your child's teacher sign somewhere in this book each year and then to give the book to your child when they graduate high school with all of the signatures, so I came to Amazon and ordered it. I'm excited to do this and love the book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It had a true nail biting quality and characters to really care for. Unfortunately, I could see this scenario as our possible future.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|My mom turned me onto Sophie Kinsella with &#34;Can You Keep A Secret?&#34; and I keep coming back! I often find myself laughing out loud when reading her books and this one is no exception!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My husband and I have recently read this book and have recommended it to several people. Seemed a bit repetitve in a few spots, but overall a thumbs up.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Really awesome movie. No profanities, which is hard to come by in today's movies.<br />Great one liners, the music is fantastic. A fun movie for all ages.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I just had my second child 6 month ago & am super busy with my full-time masters program & pt job as a Pilates instructor so getting to the gym is really tough! This video was great; challenging, motivating & thorough. The only complaint would be the ab exercises are a bit easy compared to the rest of the workout.  To solve this problem I just add about 5 min or so of exercises on.  I have already recommended this! Thanks!!
076115678X|5.0|I decided to start the new year off with this book in hand even though I have been Natural for over 7 years and a Natural hair blogger.  I must say that I have learned so much from this book which addresses all types of curly hair.  Doesn't matter what your ethnicity is...this book is for the curly girl!  I wasn't expecting it to be so beneficial but others discuss it in hair forums and ask people when they really need to just pick it up and use it.  No, you don't have to use every tip and since our hair is different each person should really invest in it and take from it what they actually need. I'm glad I purchased it instead of following someone else's experience.
B009H5IS1W|4.0|Great show albeit tends to get redundant. New cast member is too rigid and typical. Show has probably run its course
6305265488|5.0|Best movie ever! Great for the entire family! Young and old will love this movie! Best movie ever! Great for the entire family! Young and old will love this movie!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Great series, first seen on HBO with Tom Hanks/Steven Speilberg.  One of the best WWII stories, based on truth, to be put on TV.  A great companion to &#34;Th Pacific&#34;.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|super cool case for a super cool kindle. fits snug and props up the kindle by folding the cover around. the elastic keeps the cover over the front and the hard case takes the beating instead of the kindle. nice and soft material on the inside. great addition for any kindle fans out there.
1451688091|5.0|After seeing the movie, this was the perfect Christmas gift for my wife.  She loves it, and is reading it currently.
0765325950|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. The vastness of Robert Jordan's world and cast really made itself known in this book and Brandon Sanderson did a remarkable job keeping the vision of Robert Jordan alive. So many small occurences throughout this huge series were wrapped up or revisited, things that any normal (or even most terrific) authors just leave dangling or never even think to revisit. The pacing was terrific and the final half of the book was beyond anything that I could have hoped for. The book truly described an epic struggle for the fate of the world. It didn't boil down to some 50, or even 100, page conflict where everything is described in broad strokes. This book brought you INTO the Last Battle. I cannot recommend this book enough.<br /><br />However, I do have one complaint. WHY DO PEOPLE INSIST IN WRITING NEGATIVE REVIEWS FOR BOOKS JUST BECAUSE THE EBOOK ISN'T OUT YET!?! Why do people think that creating the impression in potential readers that a book might not be that great (when in fact it's AMAZING!) will do anything other than harm the author (or in this case the author's wife)? Really hope everyone out there with 1-star reviews because they can't be bothered to buy a physical book are content with taking dollars from Robert Jordan's estate. TOR isn't going to suddenly say, \\"Oops, we got 50 negative reviews on Amazon; quick, release the ebook!\\" How about this, you've enjoyed this series for over two decades, maybe pay an extra $20 to get the hardcover AND the ebook. Skip the next trip to some crummy Hollywood hack job of a movie and you'll save the $20 right there.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids had this game on their iPhones,  I'm so glad they made it for the kindle, Alot of fun. Try it you'll love it too.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I love it, works great. I now have this app on my phone, Kindle and Galaxy tab. I just wish you could preview the file before printing.
B007N85POS|3.0|When I first got this game, I loved it and couldn't get enough.  However, after several weeks of playing, I'm losing interest because the game is just too hard.  Maybe it's me, I don't know, but I'm finding it nearly impossible to clear many of the boards.  When you're only given three birds, for example, and none of them have great power, it's maddening to keep trying to accomplish clearing the board and failing. I don't like games that are too easy but Angry Birds Rio is too difficult for me. After keeping at different boards 20 times or more and I still hadn't gotten all the monkeys or birds cleared, I got so fed up and discouraged, I quit playing.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I may have read too many books by this author and it is starting to be predictable, as if he was using a formula mixing all the characters who by some incredible coincidence, are reunited in all parts of the world !! It is as if the world was populated by a few families who keep bumping into each other !<br />I liked the first book much better. It should have ended there.

B003VR5PPY|3.0|I really wanted to enjoy this game, since I'm a fan of adventure games and appreciate a good story. And at several points, 999 has an interesting story and verges on being a mystery that you're working to solve. Why were the 9 of you put in this death trap? Is one of these people the person who kidnapped you and is running it? And why is some girl you knew in grade school there too? Interesting questions like that are buried in hours of inane, cliched writing. What a waste!<br /><br />The game needed an editor to cut about 1/2 of the text. There are several points where there's almost an hour of reading text before you can go and do anything. That includes even selecting a choice or answering a question in text, let alone solving a puzzle. It gets even worse as you approach the &#34;good&#34; endings.<br /><br />Characters repeat themselves, babble on about inane topics (oh, you selected a plate? Now you get a 5 minute convo abou soup bowls vs. seafood plates...), and so on. Once you beat the game you can fast forward through text you've already seen (and when you get to a new scene since you chose something different, it's back to scrolling at a snail's pace). The translators do a good job of making the text sound like natural English, but they can only improve it so much.<br /><br />There are multiple endings, and they handle that really well. I thought they threw in some supernatural stuff that was silly, but overall the good outweighed the bad.<br /><br />For $20, I think this is worth it. But if they had just cut down on the meaningless dialog, this could have been a much better game--and a much more engaging story.

159420411X|5.0|I've read Nate's blog almost every day since mid-2010, so perhaps it was a foregone conclusion that I would love this book. But in many ways, it was actually better than I expected it to be.<br /><br />Nate examines predictions in a diverse array of fields through the lens of uncertainty, assessing in each case what makes some forecasts better than others and what makes the field inherently straightforward (baseball, politics, chess) or maddeningly difficult (earthquakes, disease, the economy) to predict. The reader comes away with a much better understanding of how to appreciate and account for uncertainty, and thus how to avoid an array of common pitfalls we encounter when attempting to judge the future.<br /><br />Nate's writing has always been very accessible, which is just as responsible as his successful 2008 predictions were for the incredible popularity of FiveThirtyEight. However, he also tends to be very cautious with his phrasing; when he makes any remotely bold statement, he usually hedges it and couches it in the language of uncertainty. The result can be rather dull, albeit very precise. I assumed this characteristic would carry over to the book. But it really doesn't. It seems that either he or his editors made a decision to make his style in the book much more forceful and direct, and the result is generally excellent. The writing has a wonderful flow, and you almost never find your eyes glazing over or your attention wandering. There is, of course, a tradeoff - in a few places (most notably in parts of his account of the financial crisis), I think he neglects to acknowledge very valid alternative explanations, which is quite uncharacteristic. And there are various other, smaller criticisms I would make of the book (e.g. the rather clunky introduction and conclusion). But they're completely swamped by all of the positive aspects.<br /><br />Hopefully, the immense stature Nate gained in the public eye for his election forecasts will spur lots of people to read this book. He's already made substantial inroads on improving the public understanding of political forecasting, and the book should help people appreciate how widely many of those same lessons can be applied. If he makes the public better informed about uncertainty, it should be a real boon to society.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I went into this film with no expectations, and came out with a few good laughs.  Will some people be offended?  Probably.  Should people lighten up and enjoy a good comedy for no other reason than it is good for you body to laugh.  Definitely.<br /><br />This comedy pushes the limits in some areas, but new comedies need to do this.

B008Y2IU12|3.0|a fun dark fantasy that is fun and enjoyable definetly worth the time, look for the version with the UltraViolet tag!
B000031WBQ|3.0|This recording accurately represents the good and bad of these two great artists.<br /><br />Rubinstein never really liked this concerto (as he wrote in his memoirs), and he had relatively little experience with it (\\"too sweet\\"). And he hated to practice in general & was known for all the \\"clunkers\\" he hit during performances.<br /><br />Frtiz Reiner was technically one of the greatest conductors of all time, and he was so exasperated by all the wrong & missed notes Rubinstein committed during the recording of the concerto (which Rubinstein did not deny) that they fought openly during the sessions. The result was a fractured run-through of little distinction.<br /><br />The good is that, perhaps prodded by all this, Rubinstein next produced a flawless and wonderful performance of the Rhapsody afterwards, which is also on this disc, and was a big success (even if it did not achieve the greatness of an older William Kapell/Fritz Reiner recording...)<br /><br />The bad is that to RCA's dismay, Rubinstein canceled the next two concerto recordings he was scheduled to do with Reiner, and the two of them never worked together again.
0375869026|5.0|I thought this book was absolutely wonderful and timely. I wish this could be required reading in all schools and families. With the issues in schools today of such sneaky and anonymous bullying, you want to cheer for auggie and his brave friends. I feel that the author did a great job catching each personality in the story and it enriched the story to hear each point of view. I firmly recommend this book to anyone of any age.
B0030U1TLQ|4.0|The remastering of Disintegration is phenomenal, blowing away the original CD release by leaps and bounds. No need to worry about jacked up loudness on this release, since Robert Smith handled the remastering himself and correctly leveled the volume to complement the mixes. As well, you don't have to turn up the volume very high to enjoy it, it's just right.<br /><br />As happy as I am with the remastering though, I wish that they had released a one disc album only version, because I had no interest in all of the extra material, and the high price has kept me from getting it since it was released. The Entreat Plus sounds great as a live recording from 1989, but the performances of the songs lack energy and are rather lifeless. I didn't bother listening to the second disc of instrumental demos, so I cannot comment on them.<br /><br />Overall, this release may be worth the price if you are a die hard fan of The Cure and, in particular, Disintegration, but if you are only interested in obtaining a superior quality copy of the album, it may not be worth the extra cost.

B008CPZNL6|4.0|I find the idea very refreshing. It's great to be able to flip through news, Facebook, Twitter and other feeds in magazine headline-like fashion. I like that you can get combination view or specific feed view and everything feels like pages in a magazine. I seem to be having issue, however, with the visualization aspect of Twitter and Facebook feeds. The content appears truncated and I cannot read the entire post. News is so far pretty flawless. I still find it helpful, because if I see something I really want to go investigate in Twitter or Facebook, I can go to the separate app and drill in. I think this product has tremendous potential. I really like it.
0143038583|5.0|We read this long ago, but wanted a hard copy to replace one that never came back home.  Beautifully written, and riveting for virtually all the entire book; and eye opening even for those who thought we were cynical enough, along with a section of unexpected hope and promise that later years have blessed.  So if you haven't, learn about the dominance of King Corn, and the saga of a lunatic farmer in Virginia who became the spokesperson for a better way.  Then return to today's world with the satisfaction of having known Joel Salatin &#34;Way back when&#34;. Then you can watch Michael Pollan and the pioneer farmers with a greater appreciation od from whence they came.
1439193630|5.0|A favorite Canadian writer of mine called King's memoir &#34;the Bible&#34; for writers.  I agree.  King cuts through key concerns that can freeze a writer up.  I'll keep this on my desk as reference.
0385344333|2.0|Is it just me or are all the Reacher books the same plot in different places?  I've read a few of them and they all seem to start and end the same.  I like a good thriller, but I like some realism in my heros.  Reacher seems to be superhuman - nothing can over power him.  Will he ever get to VA?  I don't think I care any more!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I chose this book thinking it was about children in orphanages and maybe a little scary but it wasn't. I would recommend this book for teenagers and younger it seemed to be aimed towards that as he group,
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I've seen this performance several times, but this performance took my breath away. The depth of emotion, the tremendous quality of acting and voice by Ramin and Sierra, the accoustics and clarity made this an experience like no other. It was better than being there! So much thought given to so many camera angles, being able to see expressions I could never have seen even from orchestra rows, and the intensity of the emotion was exquisite.  We've watched this several times already, always finding a detail we missed before, or just because we really wanted to hear it.  My daughter bought the soundtrack, but I don't believe it's from this performance, it's just not as good.  I highly recommend this not only to Phantom fans, but to ALW fans as he makes a special appearance with the first Broadway cast, several of the performers who have played the Phantom in the past, a special appearance from the apparently mute Michael Crawford and a stellar appearance and performance by Sarah Brightman of &#34;Angel of Music&#34; made this an experience that was so satisfying, it raises the bar for performances to come.  Loved it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Unlike anything I've ever read. So good.  Interesting vacation from my sometimes dreary reality. I do believe that these books are why we have Kindles.
0062127241|4.0|If you love The Who and Pete Townshend, then this is a no-brainer. Pete describes pretty much all his childhood, how he became who he is, and talks about many, many Who 'situations' that we all seem to want to know about. He's very candid about his misgivings and insecurities and extremely open about his deep emotional state of mind throughout his life. It's a very personal book and i give him mega kudos for opening up his inner most feelings to the world. My most favorite parts of the book is when he explains where some of his songs come from. Good stuff!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This author is not a fabulous writer, but her story is such that you can jump right into the book and instantly know what's going on without five or more chapters on the background. Easy read but oh so good.
B00756GKBA|4.0|I don't care what people say about Madonna, i think she's brilliant. While i'm not a fan of all her music, it doesn't really matter, i still like most of it. MDNA is a bit too techno for me, but overall i think the disc is very good and there are some treasures on it. Masterpiece is a beautiful ballad
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is good. It is a quick, easy, mindless read that I find myself thoroughly enjoying. Sometimes a vacation from the everyday ordinary is what we need, this book is just that.
B0007YMUZW|3.0|While i don't dislike this disc, it doesn't really move me either. I have heard that all of Ryan's discs are very different from each other which i appreciate in a musician. So while tihs isn't a disc i can say stands out, it's certainly not terrible and his voice is beautiful. I have heard other songs of his that i really like so perhaps another disc would do the trick
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It is an awesome game and it never has any glitches and it is kind of like the Mario video game but with a lepracaun!!!
B006ZZANG0|5.0|i give this disc 100 stars. Probably in the top 10 best discs i've ever owned in my life. Words can't really describe the perfection this disc delivers. I love Rufus and have all his stuff, but this one stands out. It's a pop album, which is not like any of his other discs, and it works magnificently. Each song is so moving on it's own level of what it stands for. There's upbeat songs like 'Perfect Man' (my 2nd favorite), 'Bitter Tears' and 'Welcome To The Ball'. Fantastically performed live as well. Then there's several ballads, my absolute favorite being &#34;Candles'. A very personal song for him which he describes in interviews and on his deluxe edition disc on The Making of Out Of The Game. It hits home for me personally, but hearing what Rufus describes as finding some peace and feeling grateful makes it even more intense to listen to. Each time i play it, i feel exactly what he said this song means to him.<br /><br />'Song of You&#34; is a beautiful love song written to his partner/Husband Jorn. It was a show stopper at the two live shows i went to. It will move you to tears with the shear beauty of Rufus' voice and lyrics.<br /><br />'Barbara' is a 70's retro sounding song that brings me those funny little happy feelings in my stomach when you sing along with a song you love musically. He belts out the name &#34;Barbara&#34; so brilliantly, i find myself singing it in the shower. It brings you to a point of exclamation after the vocal of the word ends.<br /><br />I recommend this disc to all who don't care for Rufus' style. I have since turned on three people to this disc who previously told me if they hear Rufus' voice one more time, they will explode. All three are men, and they are now really enjoying this disc, and much to my delight, one of those men is my husband.

B006O6F932|2.0|My twins played for about 15 minutes, got frustrated and walked off.  I boxed it up and will be returning it.  It looks very cute, but is flimsy and won't stay together.The \\"desks\\"  and \\"bleachers\\" are a complete joke! In order for it to \\"fold up neatly\\" as shown on the box you have to completely remove everything that took you 20 minutes to arrange.  Not fun! I can see it quickly turning into a bunch of plastic pieces scattered all over the game room floor.  Mattel will continue to produce junky toys like this until we as parents refuse to accept it.  I bought it on sale for $60 and I'd say it's worth less than half of that.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|Have not yet had occasion to use this, hope to use it and report on it later.  Seems like pretty useful.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|So sorry that this is to be their last studio album but the collection of songs, and the concert were both awesome. Good addition to your library - get it.
0545265355|5.0|An excellent story and a great package to present it in. I highly recomment this for all you good friends.
B006LSZECO|3.0|What must be acknowledged from the start is Gillian Flynn's gift for brilliant writing; her prose imbues a relatively formulaic plot with pizzaz. I can think of no other reason why I compulsively read \\"Gone Girl\\" through the last page. I didn't finish the book because I liked the characters--I loathed them. The plot could have been lifted from any \\"true crime\\" inspired re-creation for cable drama. And yet...I had a hard time putting the book down and Flynn deserves a lot of credit for that. I read \\"Gone Girl\\" after seeing it appear on so many year-end \\"best of\\" lists so maybe my expectations were inflated by all the acclaim because ultimately, I was disappointed. When none of the characters are redeemable or deserve redemption, I have a hard time caring beyond a cursory desire to find out how the train wreck is resolved.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl's cast comes straight out of the psychiatric DSM from the narcissists, sociopaths and borderlines to the more innocuous self-destuctive types that are pathological liars, thieves, and cheats. As other reviewers have noted, the crass language can be over the top to the point of detracting from the story. There are only so many times you can read every sexual vulgarity imaginable before it becomes desensitizing and I, at least, started skimming parts. The shock value of the crassness starts to feel like a failure of imagination on the author's part.<br /><br />I realize I'm being harsh on the book but ultimately, I gave it 3 stars because Flynn's writing is remarkable. In the hands of a less skilled author, \\"Gone Girl\\" might have earned only a single star. I can't recommend this book except for diehard mystery fans or people who need a plane/beach/bus type book that you don't mind tossing in the bin when you get to your destination. The mystery is fine, but not great; the characters are individuals you're grateful don't exist in real life and the ending is depressing. Still, I'm writing this review because I felt compelled to read it through to the last stomach-wrenching page, a trait that makes \\"Gone Girl\\" worth considering.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|It is one of my favorite songs!I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys listening to music.But it today and enjoy.

B002PEP4SC|3.0|This isn't bad for a mock up book that was written as part of the Castle tv show plot. In the show, Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) is a novelist who creates a female detective character (Nikki Heat) based on Stana Katic's tv show persona. It is competantly written and reasonably like the Beckett character in the script. If you like the show and the actors personalities, you will probably be happy with the novels.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|It's almost as if the actors are flawed in real life.  Goes beyond the typical terrorism drama to ask the deep questions noone wants to ask.
B0094EDBM2|5.0|I have to admit, when this album first came out when I was in 4th grade, I saw it and heard it everywhere, but never actually bought it until now. However I've heard several songs from it over the years, and when I heard there was a remastered anniversary edition coming out, I was scouring the web looking for new discs to add to my collection, and I thought &#34;What the heck, why not!&#34;, and swooped it up. The remastering sounds great. Songs like 1979 (from what I understand is the band's biggest hit) and &#34;Tonight, Tonight&#34; and &#34;Zero&#34; sound so much better than back when the original version of the album came out. And we can't forget &#34;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&#34;, which is the song that kickstarted what would give the album the legendary status it has today and win the 1997 grammy award for best hard rock performance. And even though I haven't owned the album up until now, I have seen what the CD labels look like, and the labels on this one are an exact replicas of the original release's, so it's good they didn't try to fix what's not broke in terms of that. Other than the digital remastering, some other differences include new liner notes by front man Billy Corgan and never before seen illustrations, and instead of a fatboy case which the original came in, it comes in the commonly used slim, 2 disc jewel case commonly used today (either that or a digipak in terms of multiple disc sets), and the album cover has a parental advisory label on it, which the original release didn't have. Must have. Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am not a very advanced player so this game is perfect for me...easy to use, short and quick.  Very nice.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I spent the first 20 minutes of the video slightly confused by the concept of time travel put for by this movie. Then got ore confused at about half way in. Once I got past the &#34;loopy&#34; plot, I was able to enjoy the suspense and mystery. My advice would be not to worry too much about the time travel stuff making sense and just leave it all at face value.
B000QZ1LXO|3.0|IT WORKS OK BUT PICKS UP A LOT OF SIDE NOISE.  HEAD PHONES FEEL COMFORTABLE.<br />WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD

B004TTMYQG|4.0|Enough with the design guidelines already! I got this app because I liked the look but it's getting more and more like the built-in calendar. If I wanted that look I would stay with that app.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|If you like musical movies. This is a movie to watch. Not only does it make you appreciate acapella singing but the characters are genuinely funny. I give it 4/5 LOLs.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|This installment of the Resident Evil series is better than most films which have had more than one sequel, it explodes with action and has the potential of going on to a another storyline. It was fun to watch and I enjoyed every minute of each scene, If t5he next installment is as good as this one I will watch that one too !! Good Job!!!
B0011Z933S|5.0|Great Death Cab. I recommend this album! Lots of good alternative tracks. Give it a shot and then go buy more
B0092MKFIY|4.0|&#34;Radioactive&#34; was the first song I'd heard off of Night Visions, and when the album was put on sale, I decided I'd check it out. Am I glad I did! The entire album is very good and definitely worth the purchase. &#34;Radioactive&#34; is still the best song on the album, in my opinion, though &#34;Demons,&#34; &#34;Every Night,&#34; &#34;Bleeding Out,&#34; and &#34;Nothing Left to Say / Rocks&#34; are all also very good.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is probably one of the best shows/short series that I have ever watched. Powerful, enlightening, just an all around fantastic set.
B005H1SDQU|5.0|Je suis ravi: je viens de découvrir le nouveau groupe SQUACKETT (Chris Squire & Steve Hackett) et leur excellent premier CD &#34;A Life Within a Day&#34;: il contient 3 morceaux que j'adore &#34;Tall Ships&#34;,  &#34;Sea of Smiles&#34; et &#34;Aliens&#34;.  Un album que je ne me lasse pas d'écouter.<br />  Poussant plus loin mes recherches, je me suis ensuite offert le très agréable double album de Steve Hackett &#34;Out of the Tunnel's Mouth&#34; (Chris Squire y joue aussi de la basse sur 2 morceaux), un album qui contient des morceaux fabuleux comme &#34;Emerald and Ash&#34; (Anthony Philips à la guitare acoustique pour ce morceau), &#34;Blood of the Rooftops&#34;, &#34;Firth of Fith&#34;, &#34;Every Star in the Night Sky&#34;.<br />  Sur ces deux albums, Roger King seconde à merveille Steve Hackett. Roger King  réalise un excellent travail aux claviers  et aux arrangements musicaux, meilleur à mon goût que Nick Magnus. J'avais aussi aimé autrefois l'album &#34;Cured&#34;.<br />  Maintenant j'attends avec impatience le CD &#34;Beyond the Shrouded Horizon&#34;. J'ai écouté la plupart des morceaux par Internet. Il s'agit d'un double album génial. Steve Hackett est aujourd'hui à l'aise aux vocaux.  On trouve sur ce double album du sitar sur un morceau du premier CD, de superbes instrumentaux sur le second CD et la présence de Chris Squire sur plusieurs morceaux.

0061564893|3.0|In his 2002 book entitled 1421, Gavin Menzies tries to make the case that in the year in question, 71 years before Columbus discovered America, the Chinese not only discovered America but also navigated, charted, and to some extent colonized the entire world, with the exception of Europe. At that time, the Ming Dynasty emperor Zhu Di sent out a fleet of treasure ships to explore the unknown reaches of the earth and establish trade connections with the nations they encountered. The fleet, under the direction of Admiral Zheng He, split into four smaller units led by four intrepid admirals: Hong Bao, Zhou Man, Zhou Wen, and Yang Qing. Menzies traces the itineraries of these four Chinese fleets and catalogs the discoveries they made. He bases his argument on a detailed study of pre-Colombian world maps, asserting that the entire world was already mapped before Columbus set sail. He supports this theory with excerpts from diaries and letters, archaeological findings, and other scientific evidence.<br /><br />I am not at all uncomfortable with the idea of pre-Colombian intercontinental travel. If we already accept that the Vikings reached North American shores in the year 1000, then the idea that a relatively advanced seafaring civilization like the Chinese might have traversed the world four centuries later is not such an incredible stretch. Yet, even though in my case Menzies is preaching to the choir, his writing is far from convincing. Almost every paragraph in the book contains some kind of qualifier like \\"it is entirely feasible that,\\" \\"it is highly probable that,\\" \\"it seems likely that,\\" or a disclaimer that the research is still out on a particular subject, and the results will be posted to his web site when they come in. Another favorite tactic is the use of the process of elimination in lieu of hard evidence, as in \\"Who else but the Chinese could have . . .?\\" or \\"It must have been the Chinese who. . .\\", when in fact, as they say, it ain't necessarily so. Menziesmakes hundreds of claims in this book--Chinese colonies in Peru, Mexico, and Rhode Island; Chinese discovery of the North Pole; the Portuguese colonization of Puerto Rico in the 1430s; Chinese intercontinental distribution of various plant and animal species, including living mylodons (prehistoric giant ground sloths); and more. Each one of these claims would take a full-length scholarly monograph to defend, yet Menzies glosses over many of them in a paragraph or two.<br /><br />Menzies asserts that his experience as a former submarine captain in the Royal Navy gives him an insight into the Chinese expeditions that a library-bound historian would not possess. There may be some truth to that, but the more he brings himself into the narrative, explaining his research methods, the less he furthers his case. He jumps to hasty conclusions based on sketchy logic, which only draws attention to the fact that he is not an academic historian or scientist. I'd like to think that there's some truth to Menzies' hypothesis, but he doesn't inspire much confidence.<br /><br />Menzies is at his best when he's writing about the past, describing life in the Forbidden City, for example, or conditions aboard the ships of the Chinese treasure fleet. Even then, he's prone to exaggeration and speculation, but at least he makes the past come to life. If he really wants to further this theory, he should express it in the form of a Da Vinci Code-style historical novel. He's as good a researcher as Dan Brown and certainly a better prose stylist (faint praise, indeed). Until then, 1421 will have to do. It's a fascinating ride, an entertaining read, and a smorgasbord of food for thought, but best swallowed with a grain of salt.

I chose to buy the electronic version so I can have it whenever I find myself with free time while waiting or traveling.  A 'tear jerker' for sure, but well worth it.

0062060562|3.0|I devoured this book over the course of three nights. It is compulsively readable and manages to remain interesting, despite being necessarily repetitive. Christine's memory loss means we go through the recovery of the same key memories over and over with her, although they do not remain as fresh for the reader as they do for her. I also had guessed the ending long before its reveal; however, the way in which the story unfolds is interesting. The structure of the book relies overmuch on the concept of Christine's journal, to the point where three-fourths of the book is the reader reading her journal with her. The journal is also the vehicle for the final reveal. While this works, I found it disruptive and wondered how else the story could have been told. A major problem is Christine's \\"journal\\" read like a novel, and people don't write like that. Even if she is a writer, I struggle to believe that a woman with severe memory problems can re-create entire conversations over the course of an afternoon, hours after they've occurred. I can't even do that and my memory is fabulous. Also the progress Christine is making in the journal is contradictory to the morning at the beginning of the novel, although perhaps that is me being picky.<br /><br />Comparisons to Memento are inevitable, particularly given the reliance on the main character's own manipulation of memory for events through the way he or she records it. I did figure out the ending long before it unfolded, and it all seemed rather convenient to me. However, my complaint is not with the who, what, why aspect (I'm trying to avoid spoilers) of the mystery, but rather the how (I'm speaking of the photographs that were explained away at the end. Oh, they don't fit? Must have faked them).<br /><br />All of this sounds as if I didn't like the book, and it's not true. I enjoyed it, particularly the beginning, but the ending was a disappointment for me. It seemed as though the attention to detail throughout the book fell flat and any loose ends were shrugged off. Also, despite a lack of picture of indication of gender on the actual book, I found some descriptions of sexuality odd and guessed that SJ Watson must be a man. I was correct. Overall, he does a good job of writing from a female's perspective, but there are parts that don't ring true.flat and any loose ends were shrugged off.

B004T4KQJS|5.0|...PHILOSOPHICAL \\"nothing\\" [ 0 + 0 = 0 ] is one thing, and PHYSICAL \\"nothing\\" [ n + (-n) = 0 ] is something else, not at all the same as philosophical nothing.  Keep this in mind when you read Krauss' \\"A Universe From Nothing\\" and you will understand why there IS a reasonable, rational possible alternative for the origin of the universe from \\"nothing\\" than that it was willfully created ex nihilo (from philosophical nothing) by an uncaused existential but immaterial supernatural creator being.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is very fun to play and I would definitely recommend it to people of all ages. It has a high replay value unlike many other mobile games
B009VB9VKY|1.0|I would give this movie zero stars if I could. Wish I could get my money back. All the participants will try to bury their association with this movie on their résumés. Lame script, lame acting, poor continuity and absolutely pointless reason to exist. Embarrassing for all especially me. I can't even tell people not to watch it because I don't want anyone to know I spent 30\\" trying to find a reason to continue watching.
B0095R76EW|1.0|Although I paid extra for HD quality, the video was far from it!!  I had used VUDU to rent a movie the previous night (on the same tv and internet) and the quality was far superior.  The movie itself was funny but could hav ebeen edited down a bit.  It dragged at times... Siegel is hilarious though!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|*No Spoilers<br /><br />For $.99 you can't beat this story (hell, for $2.99 you can't either).  There were a few typos and formatting issues here and there, but no deal breakers.  It's about the story...and I loved this story.  The author obviously has a higher grasp on science and engineering than your normal run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi writer.<br /><br />Simply: I loved the story, man.  You should charge more for it, but I respect the fact that you don't.  It would make an excellent movie!<br /><br />Thanks, for the entertainment.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a very good book,one you do not  want to put down. The story of these two characters rips at your heart strings because you want the best for them. The struggles they both encounter together and separate make it all real.  These two show strength and courage for being so young and then when they are teenagers that you hope everybody could be like them. I recommend this book to everybody.

B00009YOQW|5.0|I first bought two of these drums for my Baby Play Groups, after reading many reviews. It`s a high quality toy, that attends and respects young children`s needs: quality materials, quality sound and resistant. My own kids (who are older) also love playing with it. One of the things that surprised me and liked me the most is the fact that the yellow end of the stick is not wood, but rubber. This is wonderful for sound and security reasons too! One of my drums was not as perfectly finished as the other (lateral wood wheel is not perfectly coincident with bottom wood circle, so a thin but a bit sharp edge of wood is there). I would recomend this toy to anyone searching for good sound, good price and durability.

B007ZGBZHE|1.0|Out of all the Preston&Child books, this was the absolute worst one. It seemed they wrote it just to make money, figuring people would read it because of them. It was far-fetched and at times went on and on, describing a subject for no reason other than to lengthen the book. . It was also predictable, and I had a difficult time finishing it.
B0055PMURG|5.0|I loved this movie! It was such an inspirational story that I have used it as an example with<br />my daughter!
B009CCBCU4|5.0|I enjoy reading a good historical novel and the The Highlander (Book 1: The Rise of the Aztecs Series) by Zoe Saadia is just such a book. Once I started reading it I had trouble putting it down and found myself totally engrossed in the story.<br /><br />The author did a great job of developing the storyline. She laid her story foundation and then built upon each layer, adding to the suspense and action as she went. It was easy to follow the various plots and get involved with the in story as an unseen character. I love when an author is able to make me feel like I am there.<br /><br />Each character was well developed and easy to believe in. It was easy to identify with each of the characters and cheer for each side in the story as it developed. Again, I like being able to place myself into the story and Zoe Saadia's writing style allowed me to do just that.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading The Highlander by Zoe Saadia and I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />[Please note: I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.]
B008ETOSYI|5.0|This was a great movie with a great story line! It makes you realize things happen for a reason and sometime that reason may not be clear.

B003YHSE7W|5.0|This is a great action movie that looks and sounds excellent on blu ray. One cannot help to notice that with the single disc version you are getting a part of a full package. What I mean by this is that they did not design or even label discs differently for each version, making it seem more like an incomplete set rather than a stand alone disc. I got this for $5, so it Is well worth it if you don't need the extras. In short: Robert Downey Jr. as Iron man= 5 stars.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|We haven't completed the whole first season yet.  It is great to see how it all started.  Smart and funny.  We love it
030759565X|3.0|Because I enjoy the recipes featured on SK (blog), I pre-ordered the book on Amazon. I have to say that I regret it!!<br />If I hadn't written on its first pages, I'd have returned it. Although the recipes are good, the pictures came out sometimes dark, sometimes faded. In the blog, photography looks great but not in the book at all. I don't know whether there is a problem with printing or what?! Before buying any book, I gotta see it first. No book pre-orders anymore!!!

B007P3Q95K|5.0|My exposure to Shakespeare has been limited to say the least.  The closest I've  ever come was seeing \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" on Broadway years ago.  Didn't understand a word of it.  But I've always wondered how I might begin to understand.  I've tried reading various plays and sonnets, caught a few movies interpreting his plays, and always got lost early on.  I bought this boxed set to try yet one more time and finally!  The door opened.<br /><br />The set depicts the reigns of three successive English medieval kings.  There are four discs: Richard II, Henry IV Parts 1 and 2, and Henry V.  The stories are riveting and, I think, more understandable as you'll recognize many of the principal actors (Jeremy Irons, for example).  And it has subtitles!  What a simple and brilliant idea.  For the first time I could follow the stories.  Credit also goes to the vivid performances of all the actors involved.<br /><br />I'm told one of the differences between this production and previous ones is that the language was delivered in prose as opposed to verse.  Meaning, I think, that they spoke as modern day people do, but the lines are still in Shakespearean language.  I'll leave that to the Shakespearean purists.  All I know is I have, at long last, found my doorway into Shakespeare.<br /><br />FYI:  I bought mine at Amazon.co.uk.  As of this writing, the price at the Brit Amazon is $22.23 for the complete set including shipping.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Just bought this set for a friend -- 2/17/2013.  The price is now $25.70 including shipping.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|The product art amazing, the movie sound and image impeccable. The art book it is a good extra by the way.<br /><br />It have the posibility to be played in 3 language and 3 different languages for subtitles, but &#34;Batman Begins&#34; is missing the spanish spoken version.<br /><br />In general one of the best buys someone can do.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Simple plot but excellent suspense filled writing. Makes one want to read again to savour the plot. Emotional drama is on higher side.
B008QTVNUI|2.0|I was too offended by the language and sex scenes. Storylines don't need either of these to get a story point through. We used to have better writers and producers who could do that.

0547848412|5.0|I have not seen the movie, though I am told the film is beautiful and inspiring. The book was entirely puzzling to me. With the conceit of a reporter interviewing the lone survivor of a shipwreck, the story purports to make us the readers believe in God. I admit that I am obtuse about a lot of things; and I have no idea how the story was supposed to do that. Maybe one of you can tell me, but don't despair if I still don't get it.<br />  I did love the descriptions of the zoo and the behavior of multiple animals. Since I agree that people are being foolish when they natter on how animals should be free in the wild, I found congenial the descriptions of how much better off animals are in good zoos and what wild lives are like.  Do people really not know that living with nature is living with fleas and mosquitoes and ticks and parasites and leeches and cold and scarce food?<br />  The protagonist's incidents of his attempts to love God by using every religion he can are amusing, and his Hindu perception of my Lord Jesus Christ are fascinating. I wondered if the name of Pi, an eternal number, reflected on his belief of eternal life.<br />  The use of operant conditioning by Pi to keep the tiger from eating him was well done. (My husband's first degree was in Psychology in a school that focused on operant conditioning.)<br />  I was following the story with great interest until it got bizarre near the end with a blind fellow floater Frenchman who wants to eat him and then the floating island, um, okay, with the human-eating tree, Not Okay. So....hallucinations there toward the end. He comes ashore in Mexico and is hospitalized, where he is visited by some Japanese insurance representatives. They tell him that they don't believe his story, so then he tells them an ugly, even more harrowing story.<br />  Near as I can tell, the moral of the novel is that it is better to believe the beautiful story that may be false than the ugly story that is plain fact.  Um......That would seem to undermine belief in God. Or maybe Yann Martel is saying that belief is good (even if in something false) because it makes the world look better and you feel better. If so, that is an argument that does not impress me.<br />  I know that conclusion is superficially like the argument by the Marshwiggle in The Silver Chair by C.S. Lewis. If I were more erudite and capable with philosophical language, I could tell you what the differences are. Perhaps one of you could grant language to my inchoate thoughts.<br />  I would recommend the book only for adults without ADD.
B007N9FKCY|4.0|I got this for the free app of the day, but now that I've played it I'd say it's definitely worth its regular asking price.<br /><br />Doesn't have much of a plot but that's not the point -- it reminds me of a blend of Megaman (esp. the music!) together with the simplicity/cuddliness of Kirby.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I loved this version of Robin Hood. It is very historically accurate (minus a couple small details), the actors are perfect for the characters they play, and plot is absolutely epic. Ridley Scott definitely made another masterpiece!

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|It was two hours of the same tired stuff from Family Guy... random comments trying to disguise themselves as jokes, immature humor, and complete predictability.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Despite liking the first movie in the series, I did not expect much from this movie.  Perhaps a cheap thrill, some good action and some neat guns to look at.  The entire plot of the movie could have been written on a post-it but that's okay; it's not what I was looking for.  The sets were large and fairly neat but they made no sense at all.  A complex, underwater, different full size scenarios that were absurd.  Not going to give spoilers but just to highlight an example of the plot inconsistencies:  Near the beginning a &#34;scene&#34; is instantly populated out of nowhere with &#34;holographic people&#34; who a short while later are described as and treated as clones, living breathing, killable real people.... what?!  This kind of incoherent and and dumb story telling might be partially forgivable with really great action scenes and choreography but the movie fell short there too.  Despite  supposed elite squadrons being introduced, the battleground positioning, movements, tactics, use of suppressive fire etc were non-existent.  There was nothing of any interest or intellect presented whatsoever at all.  The weapons of choice for our heroin was selected off a rack of yet another silly designed set, a Vector SMG with no sights on the rail and regular non-extended magazines that were able to fire infinite amounts of ammo.  The only interesting scene in the entire movie involved two giant Axeman appear.  In short, a complete lack of logical consistency in the plot, intelligent actions from the characters or any sort of thought provoking twists left me bored at this shallow piece of fluff, a terrible movie.

I learned a lot that I did not know about how the parts of a movie are made & then put together to make the movie.  Very interesting for me and hopefully educational for my grandson.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Watched it with our 9 year old daughter she loves it.  Good for adults and kids.  Can't wait for the next ones and will probably get the books.
B002M5E2DW|4.0|This was an excellent book, very positive. Would recommend this to others who want to gain a more positive outlook in life.
B006SVHOL8|3.0|Hard to get into and a lot going on.  There are lots of different story lines and it's kind of difficult to follow.
0802473156|5.0|This is a book everyone should read not just those having marital problems.  Has something for everyone<br />from those just married to long marriages and those dating
B0072V394E|4.0|This was a great film and very bloody for it's time. Apparently it was banned from the UK for it's violence. A bit tame in our day and age but nevertheless a bloody shoot 'em up. The music in this film is great and was one of the points that really stood out. Which leads to Franco Nero who does a great job in this film as the titular character, Django. Sergio Corbucci has directed a very solid Western hitting the highs and lows of a violent era. Watch this film and you'll know exactly why Westerns are a staple in cinema.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This version is a true depiction of the timeless game. The main problem is all of the ads that interrupt the game.
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|This movie is sooo good. It took what me and you and what everyone else in this world knows as history and spins it on it's head giving us Tarantino's take on what should have happened. And I couldn't love it more for that reason. But wait, I can. From Christoph Waltz's performance as Hans Landa to the violent heroics of the vengeful Jews known as the Basterds. Everyone is on point in this great film. Everyone should see this great piece of work at least once. Do yourself a favor and watch it if you haven't. If you have, watch it a 2nd time.
B004UJAOLM|1.0|I hated every character in this book, it was tough to make it through, because they were all spoiled little brats
B005LAIHZY|5.0|They just keep pumping them out, enjoyed the fiesty girl but she did learn a lesson. I'll watch it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|hands down, one of the best books I have ever read!!!!! Suzane collins really brings her world to life and you wont be able to put it down!!!!!!!!!
B000076CY6|5.0|This was a Xmas gift request from my 10-year-old grandson who was delighted upon receipt and greatly enjoyed promptly assembling it. My reward, besides his expression of joy, was his unbroken concentration until the task was completed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|hands down, one of the best books I have ever read!!!!! Suzane collins really brings her world to life and you wont be able to put it down!!!!!!!!! make sure you read the hunger games first. Its really important to read them in order.
0451232852|4.0|The book that I thought would be &#34;NEW&#34; I would describe as &#34;Almost new&#34; the edges were very warn and I felt like I was gifting a used book for Christmas. Not terrible, but noticeable.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|one of my favorite books ever, if you enjoy classic romance, you will absolutely love this. follow it with the movie staring kira knightly and you wont be sorry
B000VZUM5C|5.0|Classic tracks that take you back to the rythms of Shaft and the reign of Charlie's Angels. Great for relaxing after a late night.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|hands down, one of the best books I have ever read!!!!! Suzane collins really brings her world to life and you wont be able to put it down!!!!!!!!! make sure you read the first two books first
0425241505|4.0|I was looking for a series of books to share with my teenage daughters and thought this might fit the bill. Maybe a little too racy for them but I enjoyed the story and can't wait to read the others.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I borrowed this because many young adult books are excellent reads.  I was not disappointed.  The author's knowledge of Greek  mythology was quite extensive.  Character development was a bit forced yet still reasonable. I look forward to the other books in this series.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Written by the celebrated Charles Dickens, it regales the tale of the disagreeable and anti-Christmas Mr Ebenezer Scrooge as he meets the three Spirits of Christmas as they endeavour to correct the errors of his ways. Though it has plenty of challenging vocabulary, I highly recommend this book to eager readers ages 11 and above as a quick and enjoyable read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Over 30 and love this trilogy! Could not put them down. Both interesting and insightful topics, in a great package.
1451696205|5.0|This book is fantastic.  The author offers excellent insight in the form of music and books that shape the character's psyche and help him to deal with troubling issues in his life.  This resonates in a way that is hard to capture unless you've been through something like this.  He describes a main character that is an outcast that becomes accepted with a very special group of friends and who is encouraged to participate in life after some amazingly difficult events.  The story is inspiring, dramatic, and yet still manages to end on a positive and life affirming note.
1609611543|4.0|I have had some good results since going off wheat. I lost ten pounds in two months and my arthritis in my knees is gone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app all the time. Definitely recommend this. You can use this on the go and at church.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Can you hear the sound of the trumpets? I can!  It's that time of year when everyone starts that new goal, gives up that bad habit and hopes that there lives will change for the better.<br /><br />What better time to revisit the Rocky saga? I purchased the new Blu Ray edition of the Rocky series to replace my sub par Rocky DVD box set and I can say with certainty, that it is well worth the upgrade especially at the low price of $19.99 for all 6 films and an exclusive bonus disc with over 3 hours of excellent material.<br /><br />The films are a mixed bag, but all our entertaining and can inspire the underdog in you to get up off the couch and do something new to improve yourself and help those around you.<br /><br />The original Rocky is the best of the bunch and is still a film that is poignant and inspirational. Great casting helps this film tremendously with character perfect performances by Stallone as the fighting underdog, Meredith's colorful crotchety manger, Shire the shy object of Rocky's affection, Young as the lovable but hurtful loser, Weathers as the smooth talkin' fighting champ and Spinell as the likable gangster.<br /><br />The film hits all the right notes with a memorable score and does so much with its' meager budget, none of the other films have ever quite got it like the original. The Blu Ray transfer is very nice retaining grain but looking pretty sharp. It is the best this film has ever sounded or looked.<br /><br />Rocky II is a solid film showing the aftermath of the first fight and Creed wanting redemption for Rocky going the distance in the first fight. It shows Rocky squandering the money he made for the first fight and also shows him if he wants to make something of himself, he must fight, because it is after all, what he does best! The Blu Ray transfer once again is a big upgrade with a sharp picture, grain is present, but I don't want to look at wax figures and the sound is a big upgrade as well.<br /><br />Rocky III is my personal favorite of the sequels as it is filled with so many colorful characters. Rocky fights Hulk Hogan (Thunder Lips) in a charity match and meets his arch nemesis in Clubber Lang (played to perfection by Mr. T) Clubber is a brute much like Rocky in the original film, but without Rocky's heart. It is most unfortunate that they Kill off Mickey in this film, but it's a necessary plot point to allow Rocky to lose his first fight with Lang. Of course, it all comes out good in the end. The Blu Ray transfer is on point like the first two films with a much improved picture and sound.<br /><br />Rocky IV is my least favorite of the sequels, it's not a bad film, but the soundtrack is dated, the Russians are presented like cardboard evil robots and the film is very short with a long training montage and of course the recap in the beginning of the film like each sequel before it. Being short is not a bad thing and the fight with Drago who makes an interesting opponent is one of the best in the series. It also opens the door for Rocky V  as the Russian robot and other brutal beatings by Creed and Lang leave the Rock with brain damage. Once again the Blu Ray transfer is a big improvement in picture and sound.<br /><br />Rocky V....I know a lot of people didn't care for this one, but I know I always joked that they ought to make a Rocky film wear he is diagnosed with brain damage. I mean really this guy used his head as a punching bag in all of the fights in these films and no one could actually take that kind of abuse.<br /><br />Rocky V introduces Tommy Gunn a young kid with a lot of power and determination, but once again none of Rocky's heart.<br /><br />After Rocky loses his fortune after a blunder by Paulie giving the Balboa's lawyer power of attorney, the Rock ends up right back where he started.  On the street of Philly with the Gym that Mickey left him. Adrian gets her old job back at the pet shop. Rocky is informed after a medical examination that he can no longer box because of the severe beating he has taken over the years.<br /><br />Enter Tommy Gunn, who wants Rocky to train him if he see any potential. Rocky is reluctant at first, but can't resist a chance of being part of the sport again. The usual stuff happens with Rocky bringing the inexperienced boxer to his own, but the public thinks it's all Rocky's doing and they give the youngster no respect or credit.<br /><br />The Duke who is basically Don King is trying to lure Rocky back into the ring for personal gain and Adrian is dead set against it. So The Duke lures Gunn to the seedy side of the sport with a title shot, something Rocky doesn't want to give him until he feels he is ready.<br /><br />The film ends in another battle for Rocky this time in the streets of Philadelphia master against student and well we all know \\"The Rock\\" is gonna win. The Blu Ray transfer is the biggest upgrade so far with a huge improvement in picture and sound over the DVD of this film.<br /><br />Now we come to the finale, Rocky Balboa which I find to be the best of the sequels even though I enjoy Rocky III a little more, this film is a fitting end to the saga and captures much of the heart of the original. The Blu Ray Transfer is excellent both in picture and sound and the grand finale fight is well done. This disc has some interesting extras and is the only film to have extras on the film disc.<br /><br />The bonus disc however is over 3 hours long with plenty to get excited about making of documentary and pretty cool game and much more.<br /><br />Final thought, if you love the Rocky films, then this is the way to go, it has all you should ever need to revisit these films and being on sale for $19.99 it is a no brainer. I have read others reviews about the bad transfers, but I watched this on my 150 inch HD screen and I didn't notice any of the distractions that others claimed to have seen. Maybe they fixed the issues(?) as some of the reviews with complaints are old.<br /><br />Happy New Year everyone get the Rock on Blu Ray and get motivated!f the severe beating he has taken over the years.<br /><br />Enter Tommy Gunn, who wants Rocky to train him if he see any potential.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow! A roller coaster ride to say the least.  Many unexpected twists and turns. A fitting end to the legacy.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Its not as good as the book (or audio Book if your reading impaired), Season One on HBO is better then season two!  But still every fan should own a copy of A.G.O.T.'s, and give a copy to all their friends, and family's as gifts!<br /><br />Don'y worry about season two being sub-par,  It's still a 7 out of 10, and it sets up season 4, & 5.  Which if done right will be 9-10/10's!  Since the 3rd book is THE BEST PART OF THE SERIES SO FAR!  AMAZING!  So Much so READ &#34;A Storm of Swords&#34; instead of waiting for season 3/4!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Horrible, wonderful, frightening, jaw dropping, tale. The hunger games will leave you hungry for more. You find yourself staying up late to finish it.
B003X82CWA|5.0|Certainly nothing new here but I decided it was time to have a copy of both movies in my collection<br /><br />Groundhog Day<br /><br />Is just such a delightfull movie with some of Bill Murray's best work & some great death's I've seen it about 8 times so figured may as well get a copy & saw this double feature our on Blu Ray - watching it for the 9th time still brings the  odd predictable chuckle so reckon it will be watched again at some point<br /><br />So I Married an Axe Murderer<br /><br />I had the good fortune of spending 6 months touring the USA & Europe a while back when this movie just came out<br /><br />Altogether we had 8 youngish Aussie's on that trip & at some point the boys bought a copy of Axe Murderer - by the end of the tour everyone could recite every line from this movie - so having not seen it for over 10 years I plucked up the courage to watch it again &  it still has that Mike Myers humour pouring out - a great movie that just reminded me of great times
B003O86FMW|5.0|Faster roller coaster. Scarier and delves deeper. You aren't really sure how deep the rabbit hole goes. Jump in and hang on.
B005AVIZ6U|3.0|The pacing is a bit off and the action a bit sparse. The &#34;mystery&#34; element is not as twisted and unpredictable as in some of his other works, but hey, it's still a Reacher!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I've tried multiple games that have to do with dragons. 100% addictive. I love seeing what dragons I can mate. Plus, it's easy and quick to earn coins.
B007VYQ9G2|3.0|A young chimpanzee named Oscar is raised by his loving mother, Isha, in a large, extended family.  Living at the edge of their territory is an aggressive chimp tribe that wants to take over their fruit trees.<br /><br />The photography is very enjoyable but Tim Allen was a poor choice for narrator with his tool references and grunting. His voice is too casual and low-brow and Morgan Freeman would have been a much better choice. The soap opera storyline was overdone.  In most cases, it seemed the animals were photographed randomly and the scenes were later made to fit a contrived plot.  For example, there is much drama about a big battle between the two chimp bands, but all we see is animals running quickly through the forest; there is no actual contact.<br /><br />Definitely not up to Disney standards.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Well Done !  unbelievable close to the real fun craziness and romance of that time - I was there - deep in it, very entertaining
B000AXSN5G|5.0|Neil Young gets better with age. This is truly poetry in motion and I listen to it over and over again.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked it couldnt stop reading it cant wait to finish the books an see how it all ends one of the best books I've read in awhile
B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|I was looking at my collection of old movies to watch and found that I did not have this one.<br />Finding it along with the HD version at a great price was even better.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me laughing and crying!!! I could feel the emotions in the writing! Such a wonderful book full of so many emotions! I would recommend this book to anyone!!
0765325950|5.0|I was initially upset the eBook was delayed as with many other 1 star posters. I have removed my previous 1 start review and here is why.    The explanation for the delay is explained on Sanderson's blog here:  [...]    It was not a choice for money and also was not Sanderson's or TOR's decision.    This is an amazing finish to an amazing series even though the middle of the series slogged a bit...
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Liked the book but it took me a while to get into it. But after all it was pretty good.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a movie all four of us could enjoy, including our 6 and 3-year-old. Can't wait for the second one!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie was a great time from the intro narration by Patrick Stewart to the voice acting by Seth McFarlane.  While it was a bit disconcerting to hear Peter Griffin coming out of a bear, the movie kept you busy watching a boy grow into an older boy while his much younger, hot girlfriend waiting for him to turn into a man.  This movie is not deep, it doesn't try to be, and it got 5 stars instead of 4 because of Queen.  It's raunchy, stupid, silly, sweet, smarmy, and did I mention Queen?  Check it out, it's worth a bowl of popcorn.
B004D1CK32|4.0|It was a fun show to watch.  Very old but amazing story and film for being over 50 years old.
0143119680|3.0|The long and detailed reviews of this book on this site are mildly hilarious. This is nothing more than a pretty standard romance novel with some very imaginative scifi/fantasy interludes thrown in to make it palatable. For crying out loud, ladies, if you want to read this stuff, buy used Barbara Cartland paperbacks for a fraction of the cost... and get more exciting covers for your fantasy while you're at it.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|It was pretty much a mess - not sure what the critics were watching - they seemed to see something arty farty but for me it was mildly entertaining but full of plot holes.
B009ZQNN90|4.0|This off beat story is fun and thoughtful.  It reminded me of To Wong Fu, but since it's based on a true story, it was even more interesting.  I Loved it!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Its hard to find a better deal for (at the time) $130. This thing will make a night/day difference to your mp3 player. Two important things to consider, your headphones/earbuds and your bit rate.<br />E17 lasts for about 10 hrs on a full charge.<br />I love this thing and use it almost everyday. Throw it in a bag or coat, with your ipod its a big too big for a mans pocket.<br />Happy Listening
0205313426|5.0|Just what I needed for class. Easy to follow for the most part and able to get what I needed out of it!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Beautiful story. Very slow in the beginning but picks up and ends beautifully. Great story for a time when women were not considered fit to be writers and had to use pseudonyms to have their work published.
140053271X|5.0|Wonderful product. Purchased two and both were a hit at Christmas time! Love these types of gifts and always seem to give them to others!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book!  All the twists and turns had me hooked.  I will definitely reading the other novels by this author!
0425252868|5.0|I couldn't wait for the book to arrive and finished it as quickly as possible for my wife to read.  It's a story that is incredible to say the least.  The two pilots lives would be unknowingly be linked forever over the skies of Germany.  What Franz Stigler did with German cities being bombed day and night is truly a better man.  His will-power in unbelievable.  The pilots each sacraficed so much and to make it out of the war alive is a story in itself.  This was one of the best books I've read in years.  I must honestly say I was brought to tears.  Not only for Franz and Charlie but for my own commrades in arms killed while serving together (OIF/OEF). You don't know what you have to live for till it's gone and these two warriors made sure they each had something to live for.  Don't pass this book up.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Purchased this for my daughter for Christmas, and she just loves it!! Thanks for the great service and continued great availability of products!!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is an enjoyable movie - my least favorite of the trio, but still fun to watch.  Of course you can't beat the quality of a blu-ray.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is my first Reacher book.  The Killing Floor is slow moving at times, but you can't put it down because there are surprises waiting all the time.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|great game not a big fan of how much $ this game could bleed the player  out<br />of if they really want to experience<br />the hole game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The box set seems to have a suede finish to the outer box and the one holding all the discs. Quality is great. Comes with The Art and Making Of book and redemption code for Ultraviolet subscription. Real great quality box set to own.
B004HYDM0A|5.0|I watched this with my girlfriend.  We saw the first episode of the show on MTV, and once we heard that there was a documentary we had to find it.  Glad Amazon instant video was there to answer our request.  The documentary was good.  People have been getting scammed and hearts broken on the internet long before facebook and myspace.  It's glad to see a documentary brought this to light and did not focus solely on the negative side of the story.  The documentary and the show reminds us that Yes this happens, however there are two sides to every story.<br /><br />Great Job Neve!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great series makes to want to keep watching the next episode right away. I can't wait to watch the whole season when it comes out on DVD
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait to read the third and final book!!!!!!!!  I love a good book, and this serious is one of my new favorites!!! On to the next book!
B0027MJU00|4.0|It was a pretty good book kinda gets ya right from the beginning and keeps ya wondering till the end
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I am fairly new to the Persona series, my first Persona game was Persona 3 on the PSP but that wasn't until I got a PS Vita and downloaded it. I fell in love with Persona 3 and although I could have bought the PS2 version of Persona 4 I decided to wait for its release on the PS Vita. I have not been disappointed, the game is awesome! The mechanics and structure of the game are an improvement on Persona 3 and the game looks so crisp and fresh. I am not as fond of the characters though, I prefer the likes of Junpei and Yukari but I am sure I will grow to love the characters as the game develops.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was so much better than I expected. I stayed up until 5 a.m. to finish reading it. Definitely a must read.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Ok  yes sure why not help you have to be kidding me please let me out of this for goodness sake
B004132HZS|2.0|Good show but not worth 23 dollars for three episodes! And since PBS plays them for free set your dvr and get them without commercials.hey BBC quit sending overpriced and counting the commentary episodes as run time to pad \\"series\\" as you call them. It's a crap thing to do!
B0099114WO|4.0|If you put Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep in a movie together what do You get? Simply great entertainment; I thought this movie was so endearing I will watch it again and again. These are two of the greats and you get double the entertainment. It is worth adding to your shelfl of movies you love.
B00003CXTG|5.0|My niece loves this movie. I bought it for her so she could continue to watch it over, and over again. *sigh*
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was off to a slow start but once you got into all the action it got really good. Especially the last like 40 or so pages. That is when everything starts to happen.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I am new to the Jack Reacher character and I felt Killing Floor was a very good beginning novel.  It was interesting, described Reacher very well and did not leave any unanswered questions.  A very easy read.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Not only was this product in great condition; it is one of the best TV shows I've ever spent my time watching.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Besides the well-known songs being pricelss, there are a few songs at the end of the Cd that are phenomenal, blues sounds.<br />This is a collectors CD by far!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Not only was this product in great condition; it is one of the best TV shows I've ever spent my time watching.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If your a Beatles fan...or even if you're not, this is the perfect Cd of a selection of music when they first achieved fame.<br />Should not go without!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Thought it was entertaining from start to finish. Brings you back to the days of prohibition and moonshining! Well worth the time and money.
B00004W510|5.0|Great classic blues/rock. They were wonderful in the &#34;70's&#34; and their songs still hold their value today.<br />I really enjoy this CD.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|***SPOILERS HERE SO DONT READ IF YOU HAVENT TO READ THE BOOK & WANT EVERYTHING TO BE A SURPRISE***This book had a few things that bothered me 1 - The predicted the abuse early on and I am annoyed that I have to read all of the foreshadowing. I picked up that Les was abused pretty easily, too.  If you can read between lines, the book will bother you to no end!  I really wanted to be led on and then I wanted a huge twist.  I scanned quite a few pages b/c they were banter and foreshadowing for something I already knew.  2 - The voices of the characters are the same as children and as teens. Storylne was a bit far fetched so these kids were obviously smarter than most children you will ever know and they stayed at that level through high school.  3 - Police would have scanned the sister's house so I was surprised that the story line was that lame.  I really thought the author was leading to a twist b/c I didn't think she'd go there b/c the homes of families is the first place they would go.  You always look from the inside out.  4 - This story was a little too immature for me.  I am 29, but I haven't thought high school was excited since I was 14 and about to go so I really, really wanted her to move on from the high school stupidity.  5 - I HATED the psychobabble.  OMG...I took a psychology class in college when I was 17 and that was enough.  I read psychology books all the time so the kindergarden level psychology was annoying...very very very annoying.  Too, the male character is not male at all.  The way he thinks, acts....it was way off male psychology. The way he behaved was much like a teen chick flick male character and yet he was supposed to be a bad boy that that hung out with jocks???  ---  Overall a good book to read when you are sick (like I am right now) but it was certainly a bit cheesy.  If you don't read a lot of psychology books and you are looking for a pretty mindless book, this is it.  It's not bad.  It's just....underwhelming.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Enjoyable story line. Relatable characters. Engaging plot. Explained characters well so you could sympathize with them Well written. Would read others by this author.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was better than I could have imagined.  I am a dog owner but really not a fan of racing and found every bit of this relatable. The way the author describes racing scenarios to problems or situations everyone deals with is amazing. Great read!
0545265355|1.0|I am an avid reader and I've finally decided to write my first review ever on Amazon due to the poor quality of these books. I can't understand how these are so highly rated. The writing is atrocious. It is so disjointed Collins has you bouncing around scenes practically within a sentence. There is absolutely zero depth. Not only is there no character development, there is zero scene description either. It almost reads like a high school chemistry post-lab discussion.<br /><br />I actually laughed when a major character just randomly dies at the end of book 3 for no apparent reason and no discussion. It was so absurd. I don't know if that was supposed to be the big plot-twist or something (since nothing else ever happened).<br /><br />I didn't love other young adult series like Harry Potter, Eragon, His Dark Materials (best of the bunch), etc. but this series is laughably worse than those. If you begin reading them, prepare to be invested enough in the intrigue of the storyline to keep turning pages, but also prepare to be left wanting a LOT more that never, ever comes. The last 10-15 pages are just terrible nonsense I felt obligated to share my thoughts.<br /><br />It makes me frustrated to think she got quite rich off such poor work. Oh well.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I LOVE FACEBOOK. HAVE ALOT OF DUN PLAYING THESE GAMES AND MEETING NEW FRIENDS,. REALLY ENJOY THUIS SITE. EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Thought evoking and truly moving. A tragic love story .I will be thinking about this book for weeks to come.definitely on my top 10 must reads
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|I purchased this after reading on Nyko's own web site that it could perform touch mapping and a few other functions that it does not actually do. These same claims are falsely stated on the product's packaging. Unfortunately, a bunch of irresponsible news outlet even posted reviews without actually testing this non-existing functionality, all of which meant that it was not until seeing the reviews here on the app that's supposed to support the gamepad, and then confirming with Nyko support, that I learned that this product is useless for any game that does not already have controller support, i.e., most games. I may repurchase if this app ever receives the promised update, but at this point that update looks like vaporware.
B008220C38|1.0|The best part of this movie is the movie trailer and Keira Knightley.<br /><br />  The hero looked like an 18 year old boy - with makeup - and I did not feel that he and Keria had any real chemistry whatsoever.<br /><br />I couldn't understand, is this a comedy or a period drama - where was the emotional pull?!  It was plain ridiculous.  If you want to see scorching chemistry between the main characters then watch the 1995 version, if you want a better script, the BBC version is pretty great!<br /><br />This movie is a mediocre parody of the real thing, the worst version of the truly amazing tale of Anna Karenina, and a waste of your money.<br /><br /> Poor Keria, she was amazing as always.
0385523394|2.0|I thought it was good.  But the movie will be much better.  You know what they say, \\"the movie is always better than the book (sic).\\"  Anyway, enjoy.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|First thing is you are attacked with ads, but should you survive the onslaught, the game turns out great for the price<br />Would recommend giving it a go
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Great holiday classic story! I like to read this around the holidays, perfect to have in e format for Kindle!
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The plot wasn't bad but the quality of the sound was poor, kept having to increase/decrease the sound the entire movie.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|Funny movie.... It was a lot better that I thought it would be. If you like comedy your like this movie
B005HSL626|5.0|This would probably work better with a stylus (which we will probably purchase soon) mainly due to fingers leaving streaks all over the screen. However, this is still very fun and keeps us busy.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Had some trouble with it initially, it wasn't keeping correct time and was always showing 1 hour behind for my time zone. but somehow it works right now. 4/5
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|First time playing an Angry Birds game. We love this game! Seems very addictive but is nice because you actually have to use your brain a bit, especially if you want to get all 3 stars.
0765325950|5.0|I will not give anything away or give spoilers, I cannot stand when people do that. Instead I will just say it's the perfect ending done by the perfect choice. Congrats to Brandon Sanderson for what will surely be his most successful year to date. With the Wheel of Time finished, he will bring us into his world of the Stormlight Archive, giving us another series to follow with great anticipation. An Amazing book and conclusion to one of the most beloved fantasy series of all time. Please read, over and over and over again. Then go out and buy everything else Sanderson has written, you will not be surprised at the joy you receive from reading his books.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Ok, so it does have the origin of the Xenomorphs which I was hoping would've been more interesting. I enjoyed the movie though, I couldn't complain for the cyber monday price. As someone who's sick and tired of Hollywood propaganda, I found this enjoyable, having slightly less than most movies these days.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|They are making an ultimate collectors edition sometime later this year, however, I am one of those people who never watch bonus features or interviews with the filmmakers so if you don't care about that stuff i would recommend buying this. It is just the movies and booklet for pictures of behind the scenes stuff that is cool to look through once.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've enjoyed playing this game for a very long time now. Keeps your mind going if you're in a boring situation. Works great on the tablet.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|This movie is prefect for identifying all of the problems around the collapse of 2008 in the world economy. It is kind of lengthy and the interviews do get a little boring but there is a reason it won the academy for best documentary. Do recommend 10/10
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Great app for keeping local chain stores honest and getting them to match when Amazon has better prices.  Recommend it for anyone, especially Prime members.
B005LAII8A|4.0|I am giving this 4 stars for only one reason. The Ultraviolet stuff that comes with this is stupid. When i got it it told me to go to sony pictures and redeem it. I did. However when i got the dark knight on trilogy that only runs on Flixster. So now i have two different software's on my computer for movies. They need to make UV on your desktop not through someone's software. Its basically like having iTunes and then a windows version of iTunes. Why would i want a library on my computer that is complete in two different things. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Make sure you know what you are doing with these UV collections.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|I'm just an average fan of Peter Gabriel, but I must have listened to &#34;So&#34; hundreds of times in the course of my life.  This remaster sounds fantastic, which is impressive considering I ordered it as an MP3 download (which theoretically loses fidelity).  I play bass guitar as a hobby, and I can hear the bass much more distinctively and clearly in many songs - it's made me want to learn the parts I never heard before!
B0087ZG7GQ|5.0|An incredible movie released the way all blu rays should be released: blu ray, DVD and digital copy in one package.
1847940323|4.0|Almost everyone struggles with significant change; this book reveals how to deal with it effectively or cause it to happen when needed.
B000003N7Y|5.0|Mingus' brillance shines in every piece; boy, could he swing!  This rendition of Good Bye Pork Pie Hat will grab your soul.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|In addition to finding the plot weak as a basis for a novel, there was no one in the story who was likeable. Characters don't have to be heros, but there has to be someone in the story I could respect, admire or find interesting.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was a great demonstration of having a conscience and doing what is morally correct.  Being able accept the need for love was very well portrayed.  Everyone should see this movie!!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it works, but not with the lightning speed i have become accustomed to with computer or ipad, there are still some features missing, and would love to see the whole fb experience be available/
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Narrated by death, This book takes place in Nazi Germany. We follow the story of Lisel, a young girl during that time. The perspective we are given drawer me close to all of the characters, even crying at some times. It was written in a beautiful way that made me sad when I was done, because there was none left. Read this book. I can honestly say that this is the best book I've ever read.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was a great story, and leaves you waiting for more!<br />Hope this is only the first book, gotta look for more!
B001AITH50|5.0|Great suspenseful horror with a plot that keeps your attention.  If you like vampire movies you will love this movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|quick & clear pic. the app is just like the app should be. options are offered and it is very easy to read. love it!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This app downloaded, installed & performed flawlessly on my Kindle HD 8.9\\". But, most off all....it looks AMAZING while being played. I'm sure it'll look pretty darn good on the original Kindle or any other basic tablet for the matter because the high definition graphics are simply outstanding!!<br /><br />Patchworkz is unlike any puzzle game I've ever played. As I'd mentioned above, it has gorgeous high definition graphics, combined with realistic sound effects; making this game completely different than any other puzzle app. For example: The glass puzzles have the sound of glass tiles clinking together as you're playing, while the wooden puzzles sound more like children's blocks being stacked or placed side by side. It was apparent to me, that a good deal of thought & imagination went into this game. Also, each picture used for these puzzles are a lovely work of art. Whoever the artist is or, are.....they have done an outstanding job of creating several packs of eye-pleasing pictures!<br /><br />Oh. Just a warning! I should mention how Patchworkz could be \\"slightly\\" addictive! I can't tell you how many times in just the last 2 days where I've told myself, \\" I really DO need to call it quits! Right after I finish this puzzle....\\" Twenty puzzles later'.....I was STILL playing!<br /><br />BigFish Games typically releases high quality 4 & 5 stars games & it is in my opinion, that Puzzleworkz is another one of those games. I highly recommend this one! Especially to those of you who love puzzles. It is most definitely worth the $1.99 that I paid! =)
B008N1V11U|4.0|Amazing graphics and gameplay.  This reminds me of Arkham City, and that's a really good thing!  It's worth the money, if you like games that allow you to move about the screen in crazy and unusual ways.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a fun, easy game thats simple to enjoy. the game slowly builds on itself and becomes a little more complicated but still maintains its ease of use.
B00957T6X6|4.0|Well, if you have not heard of this story go watch some HBO and get hooked!  Great fantasy, following the stories of many different characters through a chaotic time period for this fantasy empire!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This program gives me some idea of British history before and after World War I.  I can see the struggle of the conservative and the liberal reform among the upper class and the lower class.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sadly,(and lazily) I have never written a review on ANY book, EVER. But, I have to now because I absolutely loved this book. I stayed up all night because I simply could not put it down. It will make you smile, laugh, teary eyed and surprise the heck out of you. I can't wait to read Colleen's other books. DON'T PASS IT UP.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I recommend this book to all fans of Harry Bosch and all fans of an exciting read.<br />Have read almost all of Michael Connelly and have enjoyed them all.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|I'm a Harry Potter fan and I don't get tired of watching it. Movie is great, good quality sound. The only problem was that I bought the HD version and unfortunately that wasn't what I got. =/
B005HI4LLY|5.0|My 63 year old mother almost fell out of her chair laughing at this movie. I have not seen a movie this funny in a long time.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie.  Watched it after I heard there was a sequel coming.  This was missing something to make it great.  Not sure what - just seemed to be missing something.  I had it available to watch over 2 days and only watched it once.  Movies that are really good get a 2nd and 3rd viewing.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I enjoy John Grisham, but sometimes one feels as if an author's effort is mainly for his annual income supplement.  This is one of those times.  I read the book about two months ago, and it is gone from my memory already.  I haven't a clue of what it was about.  Not like some of his more oustanding earlier works.  Yet I will keep reading him, because he does put out some good work.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I watched all six movies with my son, and for the first time understood the full story line.  The remaster was great , but the audio quality (loud special effects, quiet dialogue) was not great.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I love this show and I love amazon instant watch. I always put a few episodes of my favorite shows on my kindle to watch whenever I want. Magic that comes at a reasonable price.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I had forgotten how great these movies were.  I would have given it 5 stars except the video quality was not to Blu-ray standard.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|I read another comment that there are no instructions.  What good does a comment do if there is no answer.  Another mentioned the panoramic icon - I don't have a panoramic icon.  There is no choice for help.  The camera only takes a picture facing me.  I want to take a picture of the world around me.  I don't understand this being flagged as a good value.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Prim was the only reason for a loss of a star, don't want it to be over. So captivating you feel as if you're a character.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Helps with the background story of the Avengers yet stands alone as a good movie.. I highly reccomend it if you are into the Marvel heroes
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|This one felt a lot like a video game which this was spawn from. It was true to expectations... a lot of creatures getting their heads blown off. Much action and Milla in a tight suit. I liked the game and have enjoyed the movies.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Not as good as the first two movies but a must see to complete the saga..If you liked the first two you will enjoy where this story goes
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Takes place in the future. You have to pay attention because you have to allow yourself to think outside the box to follow along. The narrator does a good job of helping explain what is happening. I liked this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show always draws me in with it's imagery and well written story line. I am so glad it made it back for a third season.
B000YHG72E|3.0|Plenty of laughs and has a heart warming undertone. Appropriate for all ages from what I recall. My kids loved it!
B002DJSBL6|4.0|One of the best romantic movies of all time. Want a good movie for you and that special person?  This is it
B004XWMXX8|5.0|This is a great CD that even my family over seas, who don't speak English, love it :D Buy it!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This isn't just your old run of the mill novel/mystery. It's different and a book you'll recommend to others.At the same time it's creditable something I like in a book .The characters are passionate and though it takes place in England it's very relatable.
B00992CF6W|1.0|the slowist game ever NOT worth $7.00.  I hate  this game and now I have no more money. keep this in mind.
B0086700CM|2.0|but it's way too fast for an old gal like me.  I had heard a lot about it and thought it would be a good game for me to add to my newly purchased Kindle Fire HD.  I think I should stick to something a little slower.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Matt Damon was hilarious in this movie
B008A1NSTG|3.0|I would reccoment this movie to others.  Loved the story line you just hope they directors followed the real story and they didn't add to make the movie better in their eyes.
B00466HN6S|4.0|The movie came very quickly.  As I watched it, there were 2 glitches from scratches on the surface.  We can still catch most of the funny film.
B009329Y30|2.0|I only finished the movie caust I paid for it.  Very slow and predictable I would not reccomend this move.
B004HO6I2E|3.0|I did not study closely enough, and I did not realize this would be an  'R' rated film.  The premise is hilarious, but the language lost me.  I quit watching early into the movie and then have given it away, but that is MY fault.  The condition was fine.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very well written book by an excellent author.  My husband has not put it down since I had it added to his new Kindle Paperwhite. He waits for Michael Connelly to write a new book and this one was definitely worth waiting for. Love the convenience of the Kindle. Thank you.
B001FES0IE|5.0|Nice vinyl 5 more works required 5 more works required 5 more works required 5 more works required 6 more works required
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie touched me. Recommendation a 100% to all friends and family . The movie arrived to me quickly and it excellent condition.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I never read a book in a weekend... but, it was such a page turner... that I didin't put it down until I was finished!<br />I normally read reviews before buying a book so I knew the ending was not going to be great, so it wasn't a surprise... but... I guess you alway expect more... a must read!
B00014NE62|5.0|The movie is terrific and the dvd is very clear with great color precision. I wish that I could get as good a deal on the Merchant/Ivory &#34;Room with a View&#34;.
B0056HTEC2|5.0|I saw this show on tv and loved it so of course I loved the album. Would recommend it to anyone.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I like fantasy and have read the series. There is a bit of departure from the books, but the differences are minimal. The bad guys are done well, but the &#34;heroes&#34; lack some character.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is very exiting. lots of fun. lots of gadgets. online interaction with others is cool. n its free.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I love this movie. The plot is great fun. The art work is out of this world exceptional. The characters are drawn well but seem to be more cartoony than the backgrounds, which is my only minor objection to this overall wonderful production.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|For anyone who has ever owned a dog will appreciate this story. How human like and emotional this can be as the story is told through the eyes of a dog.  It draws you in to the parallel of how intelligent and<br />sensitive these animals are and the support system they provide to people.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Scarpetta has lost her charm for me.  I have read every one of the Scarpetta books and the last two have spent way too much time inside Kay's head.
1588167461|4.0|Very good information.  It is a book every young man should have and read. All the information a man should know about style can be found in this book.
B006P0WMBO|5.0|This version of Collapse! is fun, fun, fun. I actually enjoyed it better than the original game. You will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is worth it it is awesome there are so many games and I did enjoy playing them there are many to choose from my favorite is the bird one
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Enjoyed the story. I was glad of the ending. Characters were well-written and the detail was appropriate to flesh out the plot without getting off topic.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hope they come out with another one and I will read the next one too . Peace out  !!!!!good bye.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he just loved it! Came packaged well and is first rate quality!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|awesome alarm go get it well worth it. I like the large display. wish you could change the Colorado but that's not a huge turn off.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|can only offer excellent raves........of course, for the program as i am addicted; the production/quality of the video is excellent.  only good things to say.  except for my need to keep watching and watching.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Good book couldn't put it down would have been better with a fight though! But I loved it even without!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked this book because it is written from a neurosurgeon's prospective, and with his expertise. I want him to write a sequel telling us more of what he learned when he was in the light.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I got this on my Game Boy back in the day and it was awesome, I really don't care for the three dimesional games of today so this game is a lot like the old school games, worth the time and money.
B004ASOVWQ|4.0|This book is really good at covering off why the likes of Amazon succeed in ways that the bricks-and-mortar retailers can't; why the world of online can sustainably offer a broader range of products than any traditional retailer.<br /><br />My only comment is that the book tends to get quite repetitive; a few chapters could be a lot shorter with no effective loss of content.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's fun, but they need to make the brick walls stay up longer...also  they need to give you more coins and the coin generator  needs to give you coins faster.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|This movie was weird and funny. It didn't turn out to be what I expected from the previews, but it was still good. It kind of seems like it would be a good tv series or something.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|It was entertaining and ok, but just not cohesive enough t be excellent or great.  I look at this as one of those movies that is entertaining but don't expect anything great.  I wouldn't watch it again because it is nothing special.<br />Worth watching, maybe, maybe not...
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|I watched the theatrical release and thought it was really good...so I bought the director's cut because they are usually better. Not in this case! I watched this with a friend and we both noticed that multiple scenes looked like they were completely unedited and you could tell that they were shot on a set without even trying to look for errors. Disappointing. :(
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I turned to this app while traveling, to mask unfamiliar sounds so that my kids would sleep. I like it so much that we're using it at home now, too.
B00826B65M|5.0|Balzac is one of my all time top 5 novelists and playwrights he was an extraordinary man with a wealth of talent . This is an amazing price for a fully comprehensive set of his most popular work . The humanity , realism and working beauty of his characters jet into life with incredible force . This is a real bargain for arguably one of the greatest names in literature .
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Absolutely love the acting and story lines!  Kind of an Avenger type versus Leverage.  Nice to see that crime and bad behavior bring a type of karma!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love the fact that Pixar has Finally made a Princess movie! I have always loved pixar(I remember when Toy Story caom out) And was very excited to learn about this one!<br /><br />I love the fact that is about a young lady standing up for herself, and doing what she thinks is right. Also, it veers away from the typical princess movie in the way that it does not involve any kind of romance for the heroine. It is different, and that is what I love about it!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|My sister wanted this for Christmas and I'm glad I got it.  It is just a great price to get seasons 1-5 on bluray.  Also - the show is hilarious!  The product came in time for Christmas in perfect condition!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|AVG, AVG, AVG, AVG 16 more words to go huh? Ok still typing why do they want this much feedback?
B009X01D9U|5.0|Got this for Christmas for my mother and she loves it.  It's the perfect protection for the Kindle Fire HD.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Great time waster. Only needs a couple of improvements a puse butten for starters and it takes a long time to earn money. All in all it's a really fun game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book. Couldn't stop reading it. It's very engaging. What's odd is how accustomed we get to violence....I thought it was a bit weird, even awkward. But I guess it's the world we live in.....
B003B02PF4|4.0|It was hard to tie things together in this book. I kept at it just because I never leave an unfinished book. But I didn't enjoy as others by this author.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Has all of the songs made famous by Houston, as well as some that I don't think I've heard before.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Excelente Calidad. Cinco Discos, libro, y estuche. . . . . . . . . . . . .. .
B00A80SHFM|3.0|How does a soundtrack from Les Miz leave out \\"Do You Hear the People Sing??\\" If I had not received this as a gift, I would return it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I recommend for kids 12 and up, I really liked the Hunger games books because they make you feel like you are actually in it
0767802470|5.0|Without question Das Boot is the best war movie ever to come out of Germany.  The movie concentrated on the people who experienced war rather than war itself.  The nearly one hour of extra scenes in the Director's Cut made it even more interesting and compelling.  I watched it in the original German plus the English and Spanish versions.  The quality of the over-dubbed English was particularly excellent.
B008NW67E0|2.0|I'm kind of disappointed with this album. The quality of the musical composition is not up to the debut album (Sigh No More) which was really excellent. Still it's a 4 star album based on the music quality.<br /><br />But then there is the mastering. It is seriously over compressed, to the point where it rivals some of the stuff you get from a metal band. There is no excuse for an acoustical band's music to be so badly handled that it gets a dynamic range rating of 8. This kind of music sounds REALLY unnatural when recorded this way. I knocked off two stars for this poor treatment of the sound recording.<br /><br />The first album had the same problem with the sound. I was hoping the second would get better treatment, but alas no.<br /><br />No more Mumford for me unless they start releasing something decently mastered on CD.<br /><br />It's a shame. Their music deserves better treatment.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Action, ok.  Characters, ok.  Story line......not so much.  Ending, dark.  Watch it if you have nothing else to do, otherwise, do something productive.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|Other calculator apps do more for le$$.<br /><br /> Not worth the time it takes for a few photons to reach your eyes from the Kindle.''
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like getting ideas and recipes to try from other people.  Very interesting to see what others come up with.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Joe B is top drawer.  He's great live, he's great on disk.  Don't miss him!<br />He has several albums - all good one!
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I read once that Jack Kerouac wrote On the Road without edits, with one single roll of taped-together paper scrolling through his typewriter.  The Long Walk has that feel.  It tells a story where the primary component is the interaction of participants in a contest that will spell the death of all but one of them.  The reason behind the contest itself, and how it came to be, are left rather nebulous.  Additionally, the story ends abruptly, and seems unfinished.  I wonder if Stephen King got tired of writing it, and just tied if off suddenly.  Among the other King novels I have read are Pet Semetary, The Stand, 11/22/63 and Bag of Bones.  I like The Long Walk least, but still I found it interesting as a character study, and easily finished the book.  11/22/63 is a new King novel, and I recommend that one best of the King novels I have mentioned.
B0095R64AO|1.0|Except in rare instances, I am not a fan of romantic comedies, so I am not exactly the target audience and this is probably unfair -- but I can't hold back,  it sucked! The sole good thing, the scenes with university work colleagues were sometimes funny. Otherwise, it was tedious, and at times, painful (for the characters, literally). To sum it up: This is what Hollywood thinks of Michigan. Jason Segal (sp? Don't care enough to google) is only 32? I couldn't decide whether he was playing someone older. (The maturity level personality-wise argues against it.) He looks like crap. I never much liked, and stopped watching the popular sitcom he is on years ago (though I recall that he is the least annoying character on it) but he is such a TV actor. Then, the plot! I kept wishing the couple would break up and stay that way. Someone who makes $18.50 per hour (in San Francisco) has the money to fly to funerals in England? Finally, there were several rounds of dialogue that were so gratingly sexist / ageist / eighth grade vulgar.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Rihanna finally comes into her own on Unapologetic. Each and every song on the new album presents a distinct look into Rihanna's tumultuous life, and is an absolute success at conveying the pop-star's most intimate moments. Plus, being a radio-friendly release full of pop and R&B hits doesn't hurt.
1401234550|4.0|It is often said that the best villains are the characters who do not think they are doing evil. A fine example of this is Sinestro in the \\"New 52\\" reboot of Green Lantern. Originally I was lesss than enthusiastic about the \\"New 52\\" as it seems like another attempt to get new people into reading comics by promising to let go of the previous character continuity and freshen up the stories with more modern settings and characterizations. For example, Clark Kent becomes an independent blogger rather than a lowly, befuddled reporter for the Daily Planet. Such a re-write hasn't happened with the Green Lantern storyline. Sure, Hal Jordan has been tossed out of the Green Lantern Corps. And his arch-nemesis (as any fan of the old Superfriends show knows) Sinestro is selected to have a Green Lantern ring after years of fighting the Lanterns in general and Jordan in particular with his own corps of Yellow Lanterns.<br /><br />Now that the ring is on the other finger, Sinestro is playing along with being a Green Lantern. His home world of Korugar has been overrun by the Yellow Lantern Corps. They rule with terror and murder while they await the return of their master, Sinestro. He is understandably unhappy with his corps' crimes against his own people on his own world (even though he had been a ruthless dictator there for many years). Sinestro believes in order. Sometimes order needs to be imposed, by harsh methods if necessary. But only on his own terms. He plans to remove the Yellow Lanterns but needs Hal Jordan's help in beating them.<br /><br />Hal, after being kicked to the curb by the Corps, is lost with nothing to do. He was a jet pilot but his record of recklessness has kept him grounded. Work opportunities that aren't saving the galaxy from the likes of Sinestro are unappealing to him. He has a hard time reconnecting with his long time girlfriend Carol Ferris.<br /><br />So all the backstory is still in play for the new Green Lantern storyline, which is a very interesting one indeed. Sinestro is unclear why he has been chosen to be a Green Lantern again after years of being out of the corps and fighting against it. But he seizes the opportunity to restore order on his home world. Jordan reluctantly joins up with Sinestro because it's his only chance to get back in the action, if not in the Corps. The uneasy alliance continues because of new revelations of deeper plans that will put the universe's welfare in question.<br /><br />The book is very interesting and I want to read more!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|After reading this book I have to sit back and appreciate the time I have had with my children.  I have to think that I could have been the girl taken so long ago as Jaycee and I are the same age.  I applaud her for the strength, bravery and determination she had during those 18 years.  Her story is one of a kind.  At times the story was difficult to read but I felt I owed it to her and myself to continue on until the end.  This is a wonderful truth, from her perspective and I will read this book again and when my daughter is old enough she too well read this harrowing story of survival and growth.  I highly recommend this book!
B004WY1FJK|5.0|After purchasing Marth's special cookie issue off the rack at checkout one year, I tried several recipes.  I was so pleased that I proceeded to order the issue for gifts directly from MSL later that year.  I was thrilled to hear a cookie cookbook was planned.  I love this book.  So much that I have it in softcover bound format and also on my Kindle so that I may have access to the recipes (in color on the iPad and computer) when I travel.  I don't know whether there are more recipes in here than were in the original cookie magazine issue, but I could care less.  Only once have I been disappointed in one of these recipes, and the error was mine - using moist, sweetened coconut flakes when the recipe said to use unsweetened.<br /><br />I think it is a tremendous value.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is hilarious. I love it! The majority of the movie was actually filmed at LSU so it was very neat to watch.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This bone chilling narrative has some major flaws in the writing, but also brilliant and original characterization.  The missing girl's background is plumbed in tremendous depth and the portraits of the couples' parents is detailed and convincing.  The problems are that you can see the main &#34;twist&#34; in the plot coming from far away and the numerous contradictions in the missing girl's character, e.g.  it is very dubious that a woman like this would ever have agreed to move from New York to Missouri at all & would most probably have pulled some kind of stunt to avoid it.  The character is really two different characters:  the one from before her disappearance and the one from after.  The author finds a way to skewer the contemporary mass media thoroughly and delightfully, but you may end up wishing television had never been invented.  Altogether a very worthwhile examination of how two people's lives can intertwine until both of them are doomed.
0892818875|5.0|Very useful for knowing which oils to use for which emotion.  It was a great book to have on hand.
B0019GO5BO|5.0|I love this movie because I think that almost everyone in high school can relate to the problems portrayed in this  classic. Brings back memories.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Bought for my wife for Christmas, she loves it.  She says the case is &#34;not too bulky&#34; and can still easily fit into her pocket book for when she leaves the house and wants to take her Kindle with her.  In her exact words she told me, &#34;thanks for not getting me a dumb bulky case that you would want...&#34;
B009VB97EY|1.0|Had to turn it off after 20 minutes. Very boring, poor acting, dumb plot.  Not very entertaining at all unless you are buying it to see Channing Tatum's naked buns. That was the only good part.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun. there is a sort of diffrent games. some a little challenging and others not really
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I stepped up a bit to this processor with a board that would allow me to advance if needed. As a person that has had AMD's before and had no problems I still feel more comfortable with an Intel processor. Very happy with the performace.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Interesting plot and location. You never knew who was telling the truth. Marriage is not about honesty, or is it?
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it really nailed the characters -- the meek wife who is taken for granted and unappreciated, the overbearing husband who has lost touch with his feelings and  has no clue things are as bad as they are, the marriage counselor who has the wisdom to help them find their way back.  A serious movie with a touch of comedy to lighten up the heavy subject.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I bought this product as a replacement for the original that came with my Kindle. Love the length of the cable. Makes it so easy and convenient when charging your Kindle.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|im just writing the review to get the rate this pop ups outta the game and i guess you can get a sequel also
B009FB3XTA|4.0|Received before the promised delivery date. Nice music selection but more ballad type music then previous soundtracks. I loved the song written and performed by Paul McDonald and  Nikki ReedThis is a perfect completion to Twilight Saga  movie soundtracks.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Even though I dislike apps that you have to build city's, this app makes me want to play it again because of how the Quests are given to you in an orderly fasion according to what your charictor does in the game. That isn't the only reason why I love this app, I think it also provides the player with a happy experince and leaves you wanting more to do with it. If I had to give a bad thing about this game id say your crazy cause pony people don't look at negitives.
B001SKB1Y0|3.0|but it's still a good woody allen film. It doesn't have the quality of cinematography of his older works but it's still good.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|I'm getting more and more addicted! These characters are great! The tension between Clary and Jace is almost palpable! Awesome!
B008N9AASC|5.0|I don't own many DVDs. Once I see a movie that's it for me. But my husband and I were so blown away by this movie we want to own it. The beauty in this movie touches your heart and soul! There are a couple disturbing scenes but they are meant to disturb you! Amazing work of art!
B002Z8LPZ4|2.0|I love movies, even cheesy, obvious, predictable action flicks! But this one was just bland, tasteless, lame! That's the best word to describe it - lame. Even my husband agreed, despite the completely gratuitous and weirdly long shower scene. They mumbled a lot, but honestly I couldn't have cared less about the parts I missed, it wouldn't have made it any better. Lame lines, lame fight scenes, could have been a decent plot but very poorly acted out. Sorry I wasted $3 on renting it. Oh, and most of the music didn't quite fit the scenes it was played during. Very strange, I have never seen that before in a movie.
0525423281|4.0|\\"I told him your loins were clearly burning, and he should man up and make a move.\\"\\"You did not!\\"\\"I did. And if he doesn't, then I suggest you jump his bones.\\"<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door, was like one of those scenes in romantic movies where you scream \\"Kiss her already!\\" \\"Seriously, grab his collar and give him a big sloppy one!\\" \\"Jesus, why is that so hard!\\" haha. I was pretty much like that throughout the whole book, I was actually surprised by how they have yet to make a move when it was at the halfway point >_<.<br /><br />This, I feel, is what held me throughout the book though. About mid this year, I hit a rut with contemporary books and I'm glad this wasn't going to be a part of that rut. I am so, so glad!<br /><br />I enjoyed it all! The characters were great. I have yet to read many same sex (male) parents and I'm so glad more of them are coming out in books, cause hello, that's the real world now! I really enjoyed Lola, I loved that she had a hobby of creating, making her own outfits and how crazing and colorful she is.<br /><br />\\"Nathan nods. \\"Have a good time. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.\\" I hear Andy as I'm walking out the front door. \\"Honey, that threat doesn't work when you're gay.\\"<br /><br />However, I wasn't a big fan of her boyfriend and who she was around him. She wasn't herself and she deserved better than Max. I'm all for age differences (parents were six years a part, thank you very much, haha) but when he's dissing your dreams of going to winter formal (yes, it can be cheesy). But if it's a dream, you shouldn't let a man change that.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes a mistake isn't a what. It's a who.\\"<br /><br />Now, let's talk about the oh so charming boy next door <3, shall we. Seriously their klutziness when they were together was so adorable (the car scene of them driving out for a picnic with Lola's parents, love it!). And by klutziness, I mean wording haha. This boy is like what most girls dream of. He's sweet, there for you, finds imperfection to being perfect, shy but knows when to man up, great with parents and will be there to help create the crazy things for you. He is seriously amazing and why it took Lola forever to notice this, I have no idea haha.<br /><br />\\"I know you aren't perfect. But it's a person's imperfections that make them perfect for someone else.\\"<br /><br />Overall, this is a must read! For the characters, the fun humorous dialogue, the world, the writing and storytelling by Mrs. Perkins. This thoroughly entertained me and is just so full of life. I just love how she brings in Anna and St. Clair (though I have yet to pick up that book. I know, shame on me). I'll most certainly be picking it up now, cause I just adored those two and now I have to see their story! ^_^
B004T4KQJS|5.0|I havé read this on my Kindle and really enjoyed trying to imagine how things are in the universe--I wish I understood mathematics better!

B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love Patricia Cornwell and this book lived up to my expectations.  Her writing, research and saubject knowledge is always on point.
B007SGM084|3.0|After a couple of chapters of the kinky stuff, we get it. She didn't have to keep writing it over and over and over..... The &#34;suspense&#34; parts were better. I guess I also got annoyed by the main character; she was a silly young girl. It was more interesting after the book ended and we got to she what Gray was actually thinking, explained a lot!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|As with the rest of the reviewers, I could not put this book down, finished it on a five hour reading binge.  I sent out mass texts telling my friends to buy it because it was that good, and I was only 1/3 into it.<br /><br />Now, this is a teen lit book, kind of.  Adult material about teenagers, so therefore do expect cheesy lines and perfect men.  Great story nevertheless.  Bravo
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie. Wanted to read book. Really good book. Can't wait to download other two books. Really good read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was so intense that I couldn't put it down, I thought about it all the time, I can't even keep myself from jumping in to the third book right away! I read the first book and loved it even more and these books go hand in hand in creating an unexplainable amazing book!
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|The setup is good and has potential.<br />Still looking for some sort of tutorial or instruction, however short.  Needs a little intro to a new user.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King's latest work, \\"11/22/63\\" is a book on par with some of his best. Unlike a few contemporary authors that I could namedrop here (but won't), King is not simply content to sit back and rehash the same ideas over and over with a different color palette and watch the sales fly off the charts. Continuing in the tradition of Under the Dome, IT, the Stand and the Shining, King has written another epic that feels every bit more than just the sum of its parts. Taking the idea of time travel and applying it to the age old hypotheticals of \\"what-if?\\" alternate history, 11/22/63 goes farther, showing just what it is that makes the past so intricate. and why it has to happen the way it does in many ways. The consequences of one man trying to assume his will over an incredibly complex machine are explored and reasonable argued, all within a great work of fiction.<br /><br />King obviously knows what he's doing at this point, and is an author that has taken a very blessed thirty-plus year career and learned very valuable lessons in what it is he hopes to accomplish with his writing. Many parts of this book are fantastic, but there are a few moments (scarce as they may be) that prevent this book from achieving a label of a completely fantastic King novel: including a bizarre shift in chronology about 2/5 through the book, in which events are continually spoiled by the narrator only to be shown or elaborated on later, and the ending slightly veers off into space. Fortunately, King squashes that tendency to show his hand a little early and the ending ultimately comes back into orbit to be one of the most emotionally delicate and lingering of any recent novel of his. The book may not completely win over anyone who is dead set against his writing, but with a story as entertaining and thoroughly researched as this one, what more is there to possibly say to them?<br /><br />All in all, a great work by King, with only a few smears across the 800+ pages, all of which are overshadowed by everything this book does right; which is to say, a lot.<br /><br />TAVHhadowed by everything this book does right; which is to say, a lot.<br /><br />TAVH

B004FRX0MY|5.0|The Amazon mp3 player is very good I like the ability to be able to access my music anywhere.<br />The player plays nice even tone music.  It sounds great.  As a bonus any music that you purchase from amazon DOESN'T GO AGAINST YOUR STORAGE.  This provides a nice incentive to purchase music from Amazon.  All in all if you like music and like to buy music this the player to get.  For a low cost you can incrase your storage
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps.  Play radio from anywhere!  If I am on vacation, I can listen to my favorite home stations.  Something going on in the world, you can probably find a station in that area and listen to the local radio station for updates.  Also has Police and Fire scanner.  Record something and play it back later.  Endless possibilities. Great, Great, Great!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have not had this Kindle for long, but I love the convenience of being able to read a book whenever I have a few minutes.  I almost always have my phone with me, but not necessarily a book.  I have not used all it's features yet so I cannot comment on them, but this program has been sufficient for me so far.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Gave to wife as a christmas gift.  She loves it and it saved me from having to gift an ungodly amount to my PBS station.

B0095ZQ36G|1.0|&#34;Prancing monks&#34;... I didn't make it into the story, the background was too painful to read. Rewriting history to make war seem like something it is not has worked for victors in the past, but this is frosting on a cardboard cake.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Downloaded it for my son but he didn't really like it much (too young for the concept). Although he doesn't play, I spend quite a lot of time with it. It's really fun and a good time waster.
B00846REIS|5.0|If u enjoyed Fifty Shades then you'll really enjoy this! It has all the heat with a better story line and more interesting characters.
0765325950|2.0|As an avid reader of RJ for the past 20 years, I have read and re-read his books countless times.<br /><br />However, immediately upon reading MOL, I experienced an intense twinge of disappointment.  This was NOT the book that I/we deserved after devoting much of our literary lives to this epic.<br /><br />Some pro's and cons<br /><br />PRO's<br /><br />-Brandon Sanderson IS a good writer, and he manages to capture much of the WoT feeling IMO.  He's not the same as RJ, but he coulda done a lot worse<br />-Some closure - you finally get to see characters like Mat and Perrin finally and truly play the roles they've been groomed for<br />-Some people die, some people live, and others get screwed.  Good to see some action finally<br />-Some of the twists and turns ARE enjoyable, and a few revelations are made which feel good after this long slog<br /><br />CON's<br /><br />-Several aspects of the story and characters were never covered in this final book.  It leaves some things completely open, and if they were going to do that, why take 3 freaking books to do it?<br />-The actual Last Battles leave something to be desired.  Not the epic battle that we have been waiting for this whole time.  Just not.<br />-Guess what?  Yup...new characters were introduced, with no background and no follow up.  Now that IS something RJ would have done, but with more flair I'm guessing.<br />-When you start the book, I at least felt extremely let down from the get go.  It didn't feel right, and it never does, from the way it was written to the voices of the characters.  Not BS's fault, again, but I don't have to like it.<br /><br />Look, if you wanted closure, this gives you a modicum of it.  However, for any true discerning reader, this belongs on the trash heap.  Truly disappointing.

B007SO31BQ|5.0|This is a must-own Blu-Ray for motorsport fans. Even people who do not follow Formula 1 will find it entertaining.

Two thumbs up!

0143038419|3.0|I have been on a memoir kick lately and really enjoyed EPL however I found myself wanting something a little more tangible in scope in a way.  I suppose not all of us can drop everything to travel all around the world multiple times ;)! This is largely why I think you should definitely read The Trail by Elizabeth Sheehan. It's her journey set in northern Spain along the Camino De Santiago de Compostella which is an ancient 500 mile pilgrimage/trek/journey across Spain. It's light-hearted and was definitely more tangible as the trek takes about a month to accomplish and makes me feel I could do the same too! More than anything though it was just lovely to see the journey through Elizabeth's eyes.<br />The Trail by Elizabeth Sheehan is also a lot like a walking meditation and it reminds me of all the questions I had when I was younger: Will we find the person we are meant to be with soon or much later? Is there \\"The one\\"? What am I meant to do or be? Do I have regrets? I suppose this is quite the existential tall order but these are the questions that drive us and once we are older and more settled I find myself loving books like these because they bring me back to the adventure of THE SEARCH! If you have ever had any questions about what is next in your life, the Camino as a personal journey, or know of a person who is beginning or beginning again their own adventure into the big wide world then both books are perfect!  The Trail's wit and thoughtfulness, however catches me more and reminds me of the power of words, their deep affect on us, and their ability to unearth those reminders that the adventure of life both allows us to fall and to soar. It's the adventure that exists in all of us today and that I encounter while reading The Trail more so than Eat, Pray, Love.<br />[[ASIN:1450763626 The Trail: A True Tale of the Camino]]

B003JTHXOK|3.0|SPOILER:<br />Didn't like the \\"Sleeping With The Enemy\\" similarities...so much alike that I was actually picturing that movie's town feel and actors.<br />Did  like the ending with the neighbor.<br />BIG SPOLIER...PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE OR PLANNING ON READING.<br />Read the book over a year ago....and I forget but was the neighbor Jo actually his deceased wife steering her towards her husband?
B008602KQI|3.0|I wanted to really like this, I truly.. truly did, but I found myself underwhelmed for the most part. The movie was definitely heavy on the action, but really light on the story and the story is exactly what grabs you when you read the books. They definitely left too much out in terms of the relationship between the main characters. There's none of the connection that they share which really defines who they are as the story progresses. Every actor did an amazing job and I love that they picked Jennifer Lawrence for this role. She is stunning and hilarious in real life and I so want to see her do well. Josh Hutcherson was also an excellent choice and Liam Hemsworth fit the role of.. crap.. I can't remember his name. Anyway, literally every actor in this movie is superbly talented.<br /><br />The cinematography was excellent, the soundtrack was perfect, and the action sequences had a way of making you lean forward in your chair while holding your breath. I just wish there was more, you know? I wanted to see more of a character development and to really see the book come alive on screen. That just didn't happen here. On the plus side, the movie goes so quick you could easily sit through the first two back to back and not notice time zipping by.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I really enjoyed it. It had depth and adventure. Love and great fights. I love the story line, it's really solid and you don't know what to expect. My only complaint is I wish there was more story to the Kahl Drogo and dragon girl parts. I felt like it could have been more. But I did enjoy what I saw.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|This movie was ok. The actors are all likable and they were all fairly well suited to their roles. I did enjoy seeing the kid from The Musketeer in this one. He's a cutie-pie (even 45 year old ladies can think that, right?) This movie is definitely meant for a younger generation and the kids in my family certainly loved it. All in all, it was entertaining, but it really didn't capture my attention. I was disappointed that it deviated from the book in a few ways that were unnecessary. Nothing huge, mind you, but still noticeable.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|When some people speak of \\"Love songs\\", I cringe... often it is something almost completely unlike anything I would call a love song.<br /><br />When I heard \\"Ho Hey\\" for the first time, actually every time I hear it, my heart beats a little faster. This song is so simple, yet so sweet, it invokes perfectly that feeling of true love.<br /><br />I have since listened to some of the other tracks, and as others have stated, there is not a dud in the pack.<br /><br />In a time when I had almost given up on the modern music scene with it's over produced noise... we are blessed with the music of the Lumineers, who by their own admission, are doing nothing NEW. They are doing it simple, and doing it brilliantly.<br /><br />Ho Hey is now part of my \\"Love\\" mix, thank you!!!
B000002AGN|5.0|The album came out when I was 6 years old.  The first tune and TAKE FIVE,  captured my childhood fancy, whenever my older brother played the album.  When the announcement of Dave Bruebeck's death hit the airways at lunch time, (Eastern standard) I knew I owed it to myself to grab it for my collection.  As a little girl in private school, I marveled at the set of the TV show &#34;PLAY BOY AFTER DARK&#34; .  I thought when the comedian DICK GREGORY  stepped down those stairs in his tuxedo, the tune TAKE FIVE should have been played by the jazz musicians.  Of course these were the thoughts of a 6 year old child, who knew grown ups just would not understand. :0)
0765325950|1.0|I could have pre ordered the book and had it in my hands today. But I wanted it on Kindle so I could easily carry it with me.  Big surprise for me when I came here on the day of the release to find out there is no Kindle version.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I give 5-stars to epic movies that last and translate through generations.... so this gets a solid 4.<br />Music was great. Campy, very self-aware, satirical... but enjoyable.<br />My 12 yo daughter, a \\"Glee\\" fan, loved it. My husband, a high school and college acapella singer, was prepared for \\"the worst\\" but laughed and loved the arrangements.<br />I just love Fat Amy! She stole the show.<br />If you have even a passing interest in Glee, you'll love it.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The movie had some good action sequences in it. Also the acting was pretty good. conversely however it seemed to be rushed trying to tell you the story of the main character. By the end of the movie was not really moved to care one way or the other how it ended.<br /><br />If you want: Boobs, Blood, and some sci-fi thrown in you would enjoy this movie.<br /><br />If you want: a revelation, deep plot, and great character development go elsewhere
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Interesting book based on the firsthand account of the Navy SEAL mission that killed Osama Bin Laden, interesting to get a SEALs perspective at the time. He has some interesting insight into the way the mission went down. I enjoyed it, it's a quick and interesting read - a real page turner.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|Great look at what happens behind the scenes. Such a painless way to learn American history through the relationships of living presidents, some of them unlikely pairs, who work together to get things done for our country in spite of their differences.
0307272702|5.0|I read this book really fast!  I am a Paleo/Primal diet enthuiast so this is like a textbook that shows how we have been deceived and told the wrong information from &#34;the experts&#34;.  This book is a great read.  Carbohydrates are completely responsible for our obesity epidemic, and misinformation regarding calories in/calories out.  If you are overweight or just interested in nutrition, the cause of obesity, or becoming leaner for ever- read this book!! At the end, Taubes spells out the diet and tells you how you can &#34;tweek&#34; it to fit your needs/desires from allowing no carbs to a little carbs.  He also explains how carbohydrates/sugars play a vital role in the cause of Alzheimer's/dementia, and a list of other diseases like diabetes/CVD, etc.  It is really amazing how so little evidence has been shown to support the &#34;carb craze&#34;, and the demonizing of &#34;fats&#34;!  I really think this is a MUST read!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I finally gave in and paid the outrageous price for an ebook rather than a nice paper back a year after publication.  A riveting read from the very first page.  With my newest Vince Flynn treasure, every night I would re-read the last chapter on my tablet again before moving on to the next in case I was so sleepy I missed something the night before.  Mitch Rapp is my hero and I pray to God that there really are people out there like him protecting all of us Americans.  A kidnapped American agent, Rickman in Pakistan, who knew?  Rickman is a central character who runs everything in Pakistan and knows everything about everyone.  This is a real \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.\\"  We've got the CIA, the FBI and everybody investigating something or someone.  Irene Kennedy, head of the CIA, and one of my favorite characters, 70-ish Stan Hurley makes a forceable appearance, along with new characters, who will hopefully appear in future books.  Dealing with the Middle East brings a whole new set of problems because of an entirely different culture.  I won't jump on my band wagon here because the likes of Mitch Rapp do it so much better and with fewer words.  Bang!  You're dead.  Too bad that Clint Eastwood is now past the age of playing a bad ass Mitch Rapp in movies.  I haven't spoiled it for my husband, who is reading it now.<br /><br />I went through years of Earl Stanley Garner, Ian Fleming, Robert Ludlum along with many others and someone called Eric Von Lustbader, all in between my love of science fiction. Is there life after Vince Flynn?  Do we have to wait another year for another book?
B005XZHQKY|2.0|My husband and I were very disappointed in this set of DVDs. We have always loved Jacques Cousteau's work, but these documentaries were repetitive and extremely boring. The same shots were shown over and over, and in some cases you watched the same footage for like 5 minutes while the narrator gave common facts about behaviors that they never showed. We love 3D but BOTH of us fell asleep a couple of times while trying to watch the series. We watched 2 out of 3 of these DVDs and haven't been able to bring ourselves to watch the 3rd. It's a waste of our time; if I could return them, I would.

0425252868|5.0|I am a huge history and WWII buff.  This book brings the war home.  The book does not read like a text book like many other accounts of this time in history.  It also shows you that there was more to the war then men heartlessly killing each other.  An awesome look at how in our worlds darkest hours there was light and hope in people like Charlie and Franz.  A great book to purchase!

B004LWZW2E|4.0|Where would we be without you? Well, we got The Sixth Sense and Drag Me to Hell. That's all I've got for good ones. Anyway, Insidious: Josh, Renai, and their three children move into a new house. Their son Dalton winds up in a coma. Due to a frightening series of events, Renai is convinced that the house is haunted. They ultimately decide to move into another home. Strange things continue to happen to Renai. Josh is skeptical. Renai initially calls a priest. She then brings in paranomal investigators, who have a lot more to offer. Turns out the house is not haunted, Dalton is. In the DVD extras, the screenwriter insists on taking sole credit for the \\"astral projection\\" genre. Guess he has never seen 976-EVIL 2 (not that I blame him).
0345803485|1.0|Half way through this book it hit me...this is a True Romance story with lots of kinky sex. It is beyond unbelievable! Repetitive phrasing with rolling eyeballs, biting lips, and as mentioned in many a review \\"frowning\\".  Oh, and Ana's breath \\"hitched\\"..A LOT! I had to look up \\"hitch\\" as related to breathing. It is probably the only nuance in the book relating back to the kinky sex business and I'm sure it was unintentional on the part of the author. Even the sex gets \\"old\\". And wearing no underwear after sex and then going to his Mother's for dinner. Pleeeeeeeease!<br /><br />I did not like or care about either of these characters enough to want to<br />read the next two books!!
B0007939NO|5.0|Brigadoon is an entertaining MGM musical even if budget cuts made them shoot the film in California and not in Scotland as director Vincente Minnelli and star/choreographer Gene Kelly wanted. True, it's not quite the same as the Broadway production, but as a film adaptation of the Broadway play this is excellent. The acting is very convincing; and the choreography by Gene Kelly is outstanding. The cinematography is pretty good, too, although during the \\"Almost like Being in Love\\" number Gene Kelly is filmed too far away from the camera. The sets are great but as others have noted it's obvious that the background is painted and not real. The plot moves along well and there's an element of suspense that enhances the picture along with a fine musical score. There is also the contrast between the hurry up modern day world especially in a huge, impersonal city as opposed to a much simpler life with an emphasis on cherishing loved ones.<br /><br />When the action begins, we meet two American buddies who came to Scotland to hunt grouse and other birds; Tommy Albright (Gene Kelly) is really there to postpone his wedding to Jane (Elaine Stewart) back in New York while Tommy's hard-drinking buddy Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson in an acerbic role) is truly there to hunt. However, when Tommy and Jeff get lost and they find a town rising out of the mist one morning--a town that's not on any map--they decide to visit the town and find out more about it.<br /><br />Tommy and Jeff discover they're in Brigadoon; but still no one will tell them why the townsfolk don't dress in modern day clothing and why it's not on any map! In addition, Tommy meets Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse); Fiona's sister Jean (Virginia Bosler) is to be married that day to Charlie Chisholm Dalrymple (Jimmy Thompson).<br /><br />Finally, Tommy and Jeff are told by Mr. Lundie (Barry Jones), a respected elder of Brigadoon, that the village appears for only a single day once every one hundred years! Their departed minister Forsyth wanted it that way to protect Brigadoon from horrible witches--and more. Mr. Lundie also tells Tommy and Jeff that if anyone should want to stay and join them in Brigadoon they would be welcomed; but nobody can ever leave Brigadoon without terrible consequences for them all. At the same time, Tommy is falling in love with Fiona who feels the same way about Tommy.<br /><br />I won't tell you much more to avoid giving out spoilers; I've already left out some of the plot so you can appreciate this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that Lerner and Loewe's musical numbers are all wonderful. The DVD comes with three outtakes of musical numbers (\\"Come to Me Bend to Me;\\" \\"From This Day On\\" and the excellent \\"Sword Dance\\"); we get the audio from \\"There But for You Go I.\\"<br /><br />Look also for particularly solid performances by Hugh Laing as Harry Beaton; Eddie Quillan as Sandy; Dodie Heath as Meg Brockie and Albert Sharpe as Andrew Campbell.<br /><br />Brigadoon is a fine MGM musical with a beautiful musical score; excellent acting and dancing; suspense and even more. I recommend this for fans of classic movie musicals; fans of the actors in this film would do well to add this sentimental and romantic film to their collections.ter Forsyth wanted it that way to protect Brigadoon from horrible witches--and more.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Now this is the definition of a page turner! I read it in two days, which would have been one if sleep wasn't a factor. In this book in the series, I feel as if I internalize more of what Katniss is feeling. Every want, every hurt, every twist and turn is written out so eloquently that putting the book down is not an option. I can't wait to open book three! Definitely a must read if you're a fan of the series.

In support of customer's, My review stands at 1 star until an ebook version is released. TOR, shame on you for trying to make a money grab at the expense of your devoted customers! I guess the publishers really are out of touch with reality. Eventually they will go the same way music publishing has!

0780622553|5.0|I had an opportunity to watch this interesting film again, which often reminded me how good it is. It's a story of a hero whose memories being manipulated by an alien race for their own purposes and how he was able to fight back for his true identity.<br /><br />The basic premise of this film is that all humans in the city are \\"asleep,\\" unaware of the fact that there was no daylight for many years and unaware of the fact that their own world is being enshrouded in darkness and controlled by other beings until the one person (John Murdock) who has finally woken up and saw the reality of the situation. He saw with a shock that the city is not really a city, but rather a major experiment being conducted by \\"The Strangers.\\"<br /><br />This is not your ordinary sci-fi film, but it sure is artistically rich in symbolism and themes. And, it has that dark atmosphere as similar to the \\"Matrix\\" and the \\"Crow\\" films. More to the point, it has that similar theme/idea from the \\"Matrix\\" where a humankind is under control by other race and how humankind is asleep to this fact.<br /><br />What I personally liked about this film is the fact that everyone's memories can be manipulated and changed. You can be Jeff or Matt and you can be a teacher or a gas station attendant - all overnight and again the next night. This film can remind one that our memories or our experiences can be contributed to our identities and how easily they can be changed. But, the question is: how do we know for sure if our identities are real? The idea of a person being the sum of our experiences is subject to debate because he or she can never be sure of their accuracy. The main reason that we actually trust our memories, our experiences, is because they match with our living situations. Noticed, in the film, that at midnight, the Strangers have changed the city to match its inhabitants' memories. If any physical aspect of the city been changed that didn't match an inhabitant's memories, that's when he will know something is very wrong and that's what happened to John Murdock. Indeed, it's quite an extraordinary film in that regard.know something is very wrong and that's what happened to John Murdock. Indeed, it's quite an extraordinary film in that regard.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Okay I lied. It was riveting. Absolutely phenomenal. I was shocked and amazed at the pure beauty of it. The struggles of real life. But placed so perfectly together that nothing else matters. Beautiful.
B00005JLWN|5.0|The \\"Equilibrium\\" film takes place in a futuristic world where a regime has suppressed emotions by ridding of any objects, including books, art and music and by drugs which suppressed feelings. The central character named John Preston (played by Christian Bale) is a Cleric who enforce the laws by hunting down those who are having feelings. Then, came to the point when Preston himself missed his dosage and began to feel a spark of conscience. He then turns to face the regime head-on in a hope to destroy the laws that prohibit emotions and to let the world to be freed of rigid controls.<br /><br />I do admit that this film seemed to have borrowed from films/books like \\"Fahrenheit 451,\\" \\"1984,\\" and \\"Brave New World,\\" (also similar to a film like \\"V for Vendetta\\") but it is primary focused on a world of emotions-suppression. This film is mainly an action film rather than further intellectual understandings of \\"1984\\"-themes. Perhaps, it's a reminder of our present society where people are increasingly shut off from their feelings and look down on people who express their emotions, even if it's subtle.<br /><br />I think it's a good film to watch, and quite enjoyable.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the Hunger Games trilogy books and the first movie is just as amazing. Few details are left out, but the movie is very well done.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I rated this a 5 because rarely does one come across beautiful piano music. The added cello makes the Piano Guys' music so enjoyable. They add a little zest into some commonly known songs as well.

The problem with such short-sighted money grubbing behavior is that ebook readers are now forced to look for alternative illegal solutions.
B004DM0UII|2.0|The app, technically, is pretty good.  Sounds Ok and has a good UI.  The problem is that most, if not all of the stations available on the app are internet-only stations, and quite frankly most of them aren't very good.  Some of the best of that genre are available in other apps, but this one is loaded with people in their basements pretending to be radio stars.  Not very impressive programming offerings ad that led me to uninstall.

0765325950|5.0|This Book has helped to define me as an author as well as a person. This series is everything I aspire to be. The duality of the characters, the emotions that are felt. I have never in my life read a work with more in depth character development and passion.<br /><br />Truly this is a work unrivaled destined to go down in history as one of the greatest stories ever told.<br /><br />Move over Bible!<br /><br />The emotions that Rand go through are so intense. As I read this I am constantly asking myself would I do this any different? And the answer is no. We are all unique humans with flaws and vices.<br /><br />This book perfectly demonstrates the opposing nature of our own soul.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I like the series, but it needs more motive or story line.  It does not need all the sex, but I guess that is the point of the book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it so far. just be sure to download all the rooms before you go away from wifi. cant do much otherwise
B009VL299E|5.0|Metallica trône toujours au sommet de son art et ce dvd est là pour le prouver.<br />To all the crazy fans out there this is a must to put in your collection especially you...Québec city.<br />Québec, vous nous prouvez encore une fois que le metal fait bel et bien parti de vos moeurs et continuez de le démontrer au monde entier.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|When I finished Catching Fire I just had to get Mockingjay. Couldn't put it down until I finished. Must read. Could be our future
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This was a good movie that kept me interested the entire time. I like the future setting of the movie and the characters. It was good to see Bruce Willis back on the &#34;big screen&#34; and I have really been enjoying Joseph Gordon - Levitt's acting lately. I would recommend checking it out.
B007R41E8O|5.0|This game has quickly worked its way into one of my most favorite Kindle games.  I initially bought it because of the outstanding graphics.  What I didn't know was that it had one of the most engaging storylines I have seen in some time.  It has quickly become my &quot;go-to&quot; game every night.  This is much more than a hidden object game; it is a yoga workout for the mind.
B008PWUU3W|5.0|The service was great and the sleeve fits perfectly. It does a good job if protecting my kindle. Thanks for the great product.
B006YC74E8|4.0|I needed to crop and touch up photos before posting on-line.  This is nice for a free app.  I'm still trying to learn how to navigate the program.  The Crop feature is hard to figure out.  Once you let go of a seclection, it's moves around too much when trying to change the width and height of the area you are trying to select.  I think I need more time to learn this before rating.  Thanks
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This is a great series!  We can't wait for the new season to start.  Can't beleive most of what is shown, but can't stop watching....
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I haven't had any problems so far, and it's a fun, relaxing, engaging game. I would recomend it to anybody who needs fun. :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  The writer kept my interest so I have recommended it to others.  He really was brilliant.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Love Jack Reacher and his ability to analyze situations.  A little too much detail regarding guns and ammo, but overall still a thriller.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have been using the BATTERY HD for a few weeks now and I am very happy with it. It makes using my Kindle even easier and even more fun. I am not a computer person,but using this app makes it very easy for me!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It was exciting from beginning to end.  I could not guess the outcome and I usually do! Jack Reacher is a unique hero.
B0014GJ08W|5.0|OK, the title of the CD is French, as is the singer.  But Soha sings in French, Spanish, English, and sometimes all three in the same song (with other languages thrown in)!  This is one of the few CDs on which I enjoy more than three or four tracks (I believe that there are only two which don't excite me).  Her voice is delightful, the harmonies enjoyable, but be forewarned: I found the lyrics to be melancholic.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you don't know what she's saying, the CD will sweep you off your feet.
0689835604|5.0|My 16 month old brings me a few books to read with him constantly.  This is one of them (where's spot, baby colors are among the others).  He has learned all of the body parts from the book (at least the ones they have in the book), and thinks it's really fun and funny to do it.  I wish it was longer!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was a superb read that deals with a subject that is all too plausible in today's geopolitical climate. For anyone who doubts that a shooting war can erupt between communist China and at least some US allies, if not the US itself, is not keeping up with recent news.<br /><br />I have only read a couple of other novels about a USA/China war, and am very interested in the fictional portrayal of this scenario, to explore real-world possibilities.<br /><br />I don't know who is Mark Greaney but it is possible that Tom Clancy's name was only used here to help market the book. Whether or not that is the case, it didn't matter for me. I am glad that I came across Mark Greaney's work by searching to see what Tom Clancy has been up to recently (I can't remember the last Clancy novel I read; must have been ages ago).<br /><br />Whoever is/are the real author(s) behind Threat Vector, he/they did a fantastic job in balancing out the realism of a shooting war between the two superpowers, maximizing the advantages of each nation's arsenal (conventional or otherwise) to make it not too much of a slam dunk for either side.<br /><br />The other great job the novel did was balance out the ethnical issue. That is to say, it would be far too easy to lump all Chinese into one category (communist) in such a scenario, and as has been done by some other writers in other novels about a China/USA war. Threat Vector, on the other hand, does a decent job showing that one's skin color or genetics is not tied to one's ideology. (If that were the case, all Germans would be Nazis.)<br /><br />The story and pacing is excellent, and having traveled extensively in the world for business, I can vouch for the authenticity of details about China and Hong Kong (a key setting for many scenes in the novel). This again is not easy to accomplish.<br /><br />I look forward to many more such novels because, as stated before, I am very interested in this overall scenario viz-a-viz today's political climate.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it! Read the whole thing in 2 days and I'm not a reader really! Makes you laugh and cry!
B0011UF79C|5.0|This movie is awesome in my books. It's looks at humanities attempt for perfection and the struggle of one man to rise above the social norm.
B006O3MU96|5.0|This is an entertaining and fun game to play during the holidays. The kids loved it. Easy to play and very responsive to the controls.
030758836X|3.0|I have to say at the beginning of this review that the ending left me cold and rather upset.  I won't go into detail since I don't want to spoil this book for other readers.  The book starts off in Carthage,Missouri where Nick and Amy Dunne are celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary.  Nick leaves for awhile and upon returning to his home, he finds that Amy is missing and appears to have been abducted. The police are called in and soon thereafter Nick is the prime suspect.<br /><br />The reader begins to learn about the state of Nick and Amy's marriage as Nick reveals himself during police interviews and Amy is revealed by a diary that she has written.  Be warned reader, the writing at times in Amy's diary is crass and vile. However, the diary does reveal many insights into her character.<br /><br />The story chapters switch between Amy and Nick and each character begins to reveal the plot with twists and turns along the way.<br /><br />I could not put this book down but I was turned off by some of the crass comments made by one of the characters and I found some of the story to be not quite realistic and the ending was unsatisfying and upsetting for me.  However, if you want a book that will keep you up at night, as it did for me, then this book is a good read; unrealistic but very good.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|i cant say enough about it .its awesome i have all the soundtracks from the twilight saga .<br />team edward for life
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I am not quite sure what I thought of this book. I found it to be something that I could easily pass up and I doubt I would ever recommend it.
B0002OERI0|4.0|the cd is awesome looks brand new .i like greenday they are awesome my favortie cd is american idiot .a must<br /> have for any greenday fan
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love this game it is a challenge for me because i suck aand i wanted yo get better and im getting better now that i can win a game more frequently
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is Mitch Rapp the way his fans like him... no nonsense, no political correctness, no patience with government flunkies - just getting the job done for his country regardless of what it takes.
B009O2XY12|2.0|This game is too basic.  The gameplay isn't challenging whatsoever and the \\"freemium\\" model is too obvious (the game is free, but you have to pay for the premium version to unlock additional levels).<br /><br />The graphics and effects are nice and fun, but the gameplay itself is way too simple (maybe that's just the case with the free first level, but there's no way to tell without going through the in-game purchase and buying more levels).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great Grisham tale... I correctly guessed the ending well in advance, but it was still a really enjoyable book.  He knows how to tell a story.
B00A757EFW|4.0|By 2013, you should already know whether you like Pac-Man or not, so reviewing the Pac-Man game isn't very necessary.  But reviewing this implementation of Pac-Man should still be helpful.<br /><br />The arcade version of Pac-Man uses a joystick for navigation.  That's pretty much the whole point, is navigating the character through the maze eating pellets and avoiding Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.<br /><br />The controls on the Kindle Fire are much more awkward than a real joystick.  The virtual joystick only does an OK job of navigating the maze.<br /><br />But still, it's Pac-Man.  How cool is it to be sitting someplace bored while you wait for your wife to come out of the store and be able to whip out a little Pac-Man session?<br /><br />This implementation of Pac-Man isn't great, but it's still pretty cool.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I keep going back to this game...exciting especially with the sound effects blasting away. It's challenging for this old geezer!
B004DM0UII|5.0|Have really enjoyed using this app. Sound quality is excellent. Choice of stations is excellent and search engine works well.
B004ADH1RI|1.0|I just want better for my kids.  This is the PG of the 80's--full of crass jokes (the kids joke about playboy, etc.) that would be pg13 today.
0316228532|3.0|Extraordinarily well-written book about what happens to a town and its inhabitants when they are forced to deal with the unexpected death of a man who seems to be an ordinary citizen. He has formed relationships, both positive and negative, with the villagers, and these suddenly severed ties force those who remain to visualize a future without him. I can't say that I loved the subject of the book, but the characters are compelling, if not likable. I find myself thinking about them even now that I have finished the book. I don't think you can ask much more of a novel than that.
B000HEWEJO|3.0|Of course the movie is 5 star!!!  But one reviewer said this is colorized, and it is NOT, just FYI
B005LAII3U|2.0|This was a great movie when it was originally made with Arnold Schwarzenegger and I had high hopes for the remake.  Unfortunately, it was very disappointing.  I give the new version credit for some very cool special effects, but that is the only improvement in this version.  The story has been changed, no longer focused on Mars, and there is now a much less interesting plot.  It falls far short of the original in this respect.  The main focus of this version is how many explosions and chases can be crammed into one movie, and does so at the expense of a decent storyline.  Also, it seems that the director is trying to give his wife, Kate Beckinsale, as much screen time as possible.  Her role as Lori Quaid is expanded so much that it loses the impact it had in the 1990 version.  Don't get me wrong, I like Kate Beckinsale just fine, but the change in this character is one of the many changes that do nothing to improve the movie.  Regarding which format of the movie to buy, don't waste your money on the Blu-ray if your reason for purchasing it is to see the alternate ending.  Extremely disappointing - no plot change in the alternate ending, just some filming/editing changes.  Wish I had gone with the Instant Video version and saved some money.
0765325950|5.0|Its 3:30am and I am at page 375 and find myself not wanting to put the book down. Its nice to be reading and get fully engrossed into the plot with emotions. I find myself laughing out loud, smiling, and feeling relief at many different points so far.<br /><br />Obviously if you have read the other 13 books of the series you will be reading this one regardless of the reviews. I didn't start to read the series till a couple years ago and couldn't wait till this book was released and it hasn't let me down. Thank you Harriet and Brandon for finishing this awesome series.
B00APUQJLO|5.0|I can completely understand people who watch this movie and find themselves confused and disappointed.  I get it.<br /><br />But for me, it's probably one of the most unusual and most fascinating movies I've seen all year.  At its surface, it's a beyond-simple story.  Billionaire Eric Packer wants to get a haircut across town and gets in his limo to get there.  But the simple story unravels into a more complex look at a man detached from humanity, and the main character unravels as the journey goes forward.  Robert Pattinson has certainly done nothing like this in the past.  He is almost robotic in the beginning... starched and monotone.  But as the suit comes off, and his day gets more complicated slowly we see what is underneath the exterior, and what is underneath is interesting and complex and, ultimately, sad.  It's an amazingly nuanced, mature portrayal which managed to make me feel and ache for a character that could have come across as completely unlikeable.  An excellent acting job all around, as is the acting from the very talented supporting cast, especially Samantha Morton and Paul Giamatti.<br /><br />The movie is told completely in DeLillo's interesting, rhythmic dialogue.  It dances and weaves and speaks of markets and sex and talking fungus between a man's toes.  It is also very darkly humorous and relevant to today's society.  It did take some getting used to, but the more I heard it, the more I let it wash over me, the more I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This is not a movie for everyone, that is for sure.  But for people with an open mind and a desire to see something with a non-traditional narrative and style, it will not fail to challenge and entertain.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|Great movie. I've seen it before but wanted to see it again. Amazon made it quick and easy to watch, but the quality of the stream was not terribly impressive. Perhaps I could or should have chosen a better option but I did not see one available. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Always love eBay..nice easy and fast application for shopping..great setup for searching for things that you need to look for!
B00APUQT7I|2.0|They made it trashy. The young characters talked like they were from the getto.  Too bad because I really liked the others.
B005H29GSI|4.0|My son loved them, he is a little young for them but not young enough were he can swallow them.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|It is fun to watch.  It is easy to get hooked on their world. Gabriel and Patrick are hot!  Not crazy about Jessica - this role needs to be recasted.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|The cover was easy to put on the Kindle and stays on.  However, after only a month or so, the lining of the black vinyl cover plate/stand is fraying and shredding along the edges.  It doesn't affect the protective qualities of the cover, but it really doesn't look nice.  I don't use the stand feature at all, so that's of no importance to me.  In just trying it, I agree with some other posters that, while you can get it into the stand position with a little effort, it's easily dislodged, causing the Kindle to fall flat.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Son wanted this for Christmas.  He really liked the movie.  He and his friends play Halo every chance they get.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game will entice you to do &#34;just one more.&#34;  Some of the puzzles are harder than others, and sometimes you will be frustrated because you can't see any way to complete it.  But keep looking!  Also try Flow Free Bridges for a slightly different, but equally challenging game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Still I would like to put maps like Legend of the mine mason on it also needs buckets and lava
B009VB97EY|3.0|it was an ok movie but I would not recommend to anyone..The plot was slow going ..the only thing that was good about it was the hot guys..which there where a couple..
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E. L. James did an incredible job at her first trilogy. The ending of this book gives the reader an entirely different perspective.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the fact that Ana and Christian make it through everything that is thrown at them and are so much in love.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book of the trilogy, I couldn't wait to start the second. There are many twists and turns that are completely unexpected.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Wish all the apps I download worked as good.  Installed cleanly and no glitches using it.  Tons of free books as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't believe what I was reading! E. L. James portrayal of an innocent young woman and her affair with an older man is captivating!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I shopped extensively for a cover for my kindle 8.9 and this is the cover I went with.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  My main reason for choosing this cover is the wide strap it has on the inside of the front cover for holding while I read.  I also love that it rotates so you can stand it up portrait or landscape.  Great cover and worth the price to have everything I was looking for.
B000SEI230|5.0|A true love story by an incredible author. This book is top shelf and I would recommend it to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once you start, hard to put it down!! Can't wait to move on to the second book. Definitely better than the movie, but books always are...
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Don Miguel Ruiz sheds a wealth of insights in a practical sense to live life to it's fullest. I highly recommend this book!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|The utility will precipitate psychosis. The similarity to the Kindles other arcane features is a bummer. A comparison to the needle in a haystack comes to mind.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Nice reading, not repetitive at all and gives you a good chronology of Jobs life, demons and accomplishements. Easy to read and no intellectual challenges.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|Id love to give this game a higher score but its so glitchy over half my allies it fails to load their bases so i cant send gifts nor can i get hearts from them further mosetime i go to attack another player the game crashes including when i try to assist an ally or counter attack someone thats attacked me. Further due to these crashes ive lost hours of gold collection and units built becuase it fails to save. Fun game but the glitches need to be fix. Oh and when i try to go to customer support it fails to do anything once i get to the supportt page.
B0052FX6M2|4.0|Nice to read about events from the view of an insider who has a profond knowledge of China and makes an honest recall of his involment in the building of the relatioship between China and USA. Interesting to find out how naive and badly informed was the US government  about China at the beginning.
B004NS710C|5.0|This is a great movie have seen it many times it still has me on the edge of my seat
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This modern version is very well done. I love and own the 1947 version, but also added this to our Christmas favorites too. I recommend to all, it's a good film.
B000002I2M|1.0|I know you should be wary of buying penny items but the description did not mention the disc was cracked and skipped. I would have certainly reconsidered my purchase if I had known it was damaged. As they say if it is too good to be true something is up.
0547258305|4.0|I knew she wanted this book so bad so I rated high it because it was cheap and they had it. Also because I wanted her to have something that she would enjoy and here it is. I believe it is a pretty good book. My friend would want not this if she did not want me to get it in the first place. She is like a book critic, so &#34;Graceling&#34; must a good book for her since she has been dying to get it for so long. But yes I believe it is a good book.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|They have such lovely melodies and lyrics, I can listen to it anytime. They didn't disappoint. I love these guys.
B000Z1TYT2|1.0|very poor packaging!  Disc arrived loose in case, scratched,and unplayable. We would like our $ back.  Rough handling between england and mid/america.
0765325950|5.0|I too am posting a review to offset those that are giving it 1 star just because the ebook version isn't out yet.  I am sad to see the series end and even though I too own a Kindle, I am old school and prefer to have hardbacks of books I care about.  If you are choosing to wait until the ebook version, that is your choice and it just means you have to wait until April to get it.  There is nothing new about what the publisher is doing so stop whining about it.  You are making the CHOICE to read the book in the format you prefer, the publisher does NOT have to make it available at general release so you can read it.  Your discord is of your own choosing so stop giving a great series a 1 star rating that isn't going to affect sales anyways.  All people are going to do is laugh at your QQ anyways.
B008RTE08E|5.0|I've had Magical Mystery Tour on VHS, LD and DVD. All were grainy and had poor audio. This version sets things right!<br />The images are robust and clean looking and the audio is leaps and bounds better. 1000% improvement!
1451695195|5.0|&#34;Proof Of Heaven&#34;: It is a wanderfull book, I recomend it for people who is going to die, and is afraid of it.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game Cuz my cousin gabby Metral showed me this game and now I play this gameon every day.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I'll start off with cons before pros: first off this should have been considered YA. It took me some time to get into the book because of the ages. Then there's the maturity of two high school seniors, seriously it really was very unrealistic for a boy holders age to be THAT mature about situation.The pedophilia was disgusting and disturbing and a heads up about that would have been appreciated.<br />Oh yeah and sex after finding out you were sexually abused? Ooooook??? Weird.<br />The pros of this book is that it does have a lot of twists. Writing was well executed (minus the fact that sky and holder seem more like a middle aged couple) and I honestly just love, love and this love and connection these two had was very touching.<br />Would I read this book again?No.Would I recommend it? Nope<br />I am trying to figure out why all the 5 stars though....This is just not 5 star material to me.Sorry.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|For those who like the avengers, this movie does not disappoint! I was amazed with all the graphics and special effects, and the plot and story line are awesome as well.
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|Well, I thought I would try this video library service since it was the one reasonable way that I could view an episode before the new season started.  The video was viewable on my laptop and was excellent quality.  The issue that I had with this service is that unlike DVDs. I have to be hooked up to stream the media.  I can't just download it and burn it to DVD, at least not eazily.  The result is that I cannot share this video with my Mother who is now hooked on season one.  I don't mind the video library, but I must have a way to view this offline.  Oh yeah.  My TV in the living room is internet connected through an X-box; however, the only way to view the video is to subscribe to Microsoft through some Gold membership.  Quite expensive for a video wouldn't you think.  I will now search for the DVD so that I can watch it anywhere I like!
0307744434|2.0|The little circle on the cover should have a picture inside of it. The picture is missing. I think the page after the cover is missing.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|I enjoyed reading &#34;Romancing Mister Bridgerton.&#34;  It was a fast passed book that held my attention.  It was entertaining and I am looking forward to the next book in the the series.  The author has created a Family with care and humor.

B004EI2NM2|5.0|Now here is a nice bit of erotica that is just fun and enjoyable to watch. It is well acted, and the dialog is great. I like that the movie is in Spanish  It adds a little Something fun  to the movie. So if you don't mind reading the English subtitles this movie is a hit.

B004UJAOLM|5.0|Best book ever. Even better the second time around. It is a dark and haunting love story that will capture readers for the rest of time
B007BT0RKG|3.0|After the long wait for the 49+ MB download it was a map program.  I then wanted to see a city in Japan (t could have been a city in Ethiopia but  was worried about the spelling) it then had to download more for the country of Japan.  I then went to the city and to be honest it did not even show the street I selected from an address it just showed the main routs and a train station and main street.  I have seen better but what can I say it is a map program and not a GPS location or anything else.  I have seen better nut if your looking foe a map program that takes forever to download go for it!

B009329ZF2|4.0|Pretty much expected this movie to be kinda futuristic yet kinda contemporary...  All sorta ego and cool technology at battle<br />out in the big blue.  Yeee hawww :)  I really love these kind of movies even when they are totally predictable.  :)
B007NESBK2|3.0|I found this just okay. I expected better audio and video quality. The previous DVD's are much better. But if you are a SADE fan you will still love this DVD...great to see and hear her so many years later....
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I expected something a lil more intelligent and less demonic... it's getting more difficult to find<br />an intelligent sci-fi genre anymore..  so maxed out in demonic plots.  Yawwwwnerrrrs.  Boooooooooooooooooooo
B000002UTI|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard! I absolutely love the Beatles. There were so  many of the Beatle's songs on it - old and new. I didn't even realize it when I ordered it and was happily surprised when I listened to it - to discover this. Liked it even better when I actually had it and listened to it.  I am always very happy with Zoverstock's orders too - take a little longer because they come from the UK but well worth it.

B000002KIE|5.0|Yea, i finally got this album. I wanted the UK version, but settled for the US version. A lot of musical History in this album, from what was going on in the studio in the recording of it, to the vibrating repercussions of the groups they influenced. Very Happy i got it!
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|To be honest I was kind of disappointed with the ending of City of Bones and it took me about a year to purchase City of Ashes.<br /><br />The novel had me by the very first page. I could not put it down. That was two weeks ago, I have already finished City of Glass and am now busy reading the Clockwork princess.<br /><br />I am utterly enthralled with this series.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys a gripping fantasy will love this series - It's an easy read and extremely enjoyable,
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was an absolute page turner.  I recommended this to all my friends who loved it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Bought this after reading the reviews and was not disappointed.  A captivating story, although the \\"can't put it down\\" stage for me came with book 3. Highly recommended and I can't wait to read his other books!

B002VH7P4O|5.0|The little plugin chip contain high fidelity recordings of every record the Beetles produced. Also contains photos of all their album covers. Just click on the album cover and all of the tracks pop up on your screen. Click on the song you want to hear and away they go.
B008M0NDOK|3.0|Duo is a solid built controller,But for it to be a gameloft made gamepad it lacks alot of game support.only a few titles work.At least the ones that do work well.IPAD in general needs more gamepad support.Android tablets have much more gamepad options.Duo gamepad is comfortable and i think worth getting.Gameloft claims more games coming soon that support it
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I was just looking to kill time on a weekend and this movie was definitely worth the money. Action packed, has an interesting plot and twists. Why just three stars - well I don't give more than 3 stars to a movie I won't watch a second time

B001ILFUDC|1.0|I bought this &#34;new&#34; on amazon and when it was delivered I could tell it had been repackaged. Not only that but the plastic circle the holds the dvd into the case was broken for BOTH cds, and the dvd had scratches all over it. I wouldn't even consider this &#34;like new&#34;<br /><br />Of course, the movie is still a wonderful classic.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|If you want to pay less for a professional camera bag with the quality and construction of one get this one Superb quality Recomended thanks Amazon A++++++
B00499NHLC|5.0|I enjoyed this even though it was a bit serial for me.  The interaction between the characters was good.  I think I like the Elementary series more.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This is a great CD.  I was so looking forward to his self written songs and his own style on this record and was definitely NOT disappointed.  This is not your typical industry created sounds like all the others pop Singer.  This guy is a musician and an artist.  Guess I'd label it bluesy.  Good stuff.
B009HOU672|4.0|The lead reviewer calls Vivaldi's evergreen Four Seasons \\"a pillar of human art,\\" perhaps allowing for genius in chimpanzee or elephant art. The brilliant and dashing score has devolved into elevator music, so it wasn't a long stretch for the British film composer Max Richter to turn it into movie music. That's essentially what we have here.  Easy-listen chords, chugging rhythms, minimalist bass lines, and a good deal of the original solo figuration for the violin soloist.<br /><br />When Alfred Schnittke pursued a blend of Baroque and modernist styles in his various Concerti Grossi, prominently championed by Gidon Kremer, the platform of 18th-century gestures underlay Schnittke's challenging ideas. The Baroque was truly transformed, with remarkable results. the listener was compelled to hear the clash of two eras but also their underlying sympathies. Here, however, we just get a bright coat of paint. richter's score resembles another that owes much to John Adams-style minimalism, A Beautiful Mind, composed by the proficient James Horner.<br /><br />Richter has the advantage of co-opting a very famous piece, and he makes good use of changing moods as the seasons progress. Everything is pleasant and falls engagingly on the ear.  I'd put the piece in the same enjoyable category as The Red Violin or The Butterfly Concerto, so far as crossover violin works go. Daniel Hope , like Joshua Bell, moves smoothly into the genre - he also makes \\"real\\" vivaldi recordings - and has achieved a pop success. for me, one listen did the job.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I rented it despite the reviews.  The reviews were right.  It was awful.  It was just stupid.  Not funny stupid.  Just stupid.  The vulgar jokes were pitiful.  Would NOT suggest renting.
B009ZOCLD6|5.0|Here is a gilt-edged new Brahms Violin Concerto following hard on the heels of an outstanding one from Renaud Capucon, which struck me a month ago as the most satisfying in years. It, too, was gilt-edged since the conductor was Daniel Harding with the Vienna Phil. DG's loyalty to Christian Thielemann, one of a handful of prominent German conductors on the international circuit, has brought in the great Staatskapelle Dresden, so it's caviar all around.<br /><br />With no need for another Brahms concerto, I still eagerly awaited an interpretation from Lisa Batiashvili. In a welter of young violin virtuosos, some of whom are media-attractive young women, the highly musical Georgian Batiashvili manages to stand out. On tour with the Brahms she did several broadcast concerts, and in each her interpretation completely held my interest. She has all the negative virtues - nothing is routine, slick or mechanical. Every phrase is personal and involving. Batiashvili delves into a well-worn score to find an engrossing level of expression, and with Thielemann at his vigorous best (not always the case), the whole performance comes alive.<br /><br />The first movement is urgent and forward-moving. Some orchestral chords are voiced oddly at the outset, and Thielemann's rhythmic sense can be unconventional, but these gestures aren't out of place. By the time Batiashvili makes her powerful entrance, she holds the limelight with charismatic playing. There is one blemish, however. The violin has been miked to a fare-thee-well, sounding four times larger than life rather than the usual twice as large. When you add the roomy ambience of the hall, the effect is overblown.  How much this will interfere with listening pleasure is entirely personal, of course. I adjusted soon enough.<br /><br />Capucon notes that he has switched from the Joachim to the anachronistic Kreisler cadenza. It's become fashionable for a few violinists, such as Joshua Bell, to try out even more modern cadenzas, including their own. The startling one heard here, by Busoni, uses a good deal of orchestral accompaniment, beginning with a portentous timpani roll. Beethoven introduced a side drum into the cadenza when he transcribed his violin concerto for piano; still, I have my doubts about giving us new orchestral writing. Otherwise, the Busoni is short and atmospheric.<br /><br />In keeping with the pace of the first movement, the Adagio has more than usual momentum. The finale nicely balances the gypsy side of Brahms's theme and his weighty orchestral blocking. Throughout both movements Batiashvili provides interesting detail form bar to bar - that's the major element that sets her reading aside from her rivals, and for some listeners so much focus on detail could feel fussy. Not to me. Not every gilt-edged recording yields real gold, but this one does.<br /><br />At 47 min. the timing is stingy. Capucon gives us a substantial work, the Berg concerto, with the added attraction that the VPO has rarely recorded it. (I'm hedging my bets. The current catalog lists no other recordings besides the Capucon.) Here we get three nice salon pieces for violin and piano by Clara Schumann, the Romances Op. 22.  They are engaging, melodic, and skillfully written but otherwise no great shakes. clearly DG felt that Batiashvili's Brahms justified an album unto itself, and I agree.uding their own.

B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This movie was ALL over the place.  You couldn't keep up.  It jumped around from the future to the past and back again without warning.  I had to force myself to keep watching it.  Would definitely NOT recommend.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|A GOOD MIXTURE OF ACTION AND COMEDY.....LOVED IT.  THE FIRST IN THE SERIES. I AM A FAN OF M J FOX
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|With these two starts how could the movie go wrong?  Well, the reason I'm glad I watched this movie is to tell you NOT to spend you time or money watching this movie.  I thought it would be a light hearted funny movie.  No.  It was depressing, boring, uncomfortable watching two stars heavy breathing and forcing themselves to make love.  Nope.  Do Not Rent this.
B002O4KGLS|5.0|The movie was well executed and had a strong message without being overtly preachy.  The cinematography was interesting and easily set the tone for the various locations and situations.  Well worth viewing.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Really enjoyed it.Got interesting right away.Keep me going and up late reading a few nights.I  Would read more by Baldacci.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My children started playing this game and then I picked it up as well.  I love this game.  You must think ahead before you move.  Great for children and adults.
