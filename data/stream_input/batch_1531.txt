B0015DROBO|5.0|The movie looked so visually intense that I initially shied away from this book. I am so glad my son's history teacher gave it to me.  The author takes great care in developing the story, if a bit dry, in pages 1-35. Then the story takes off and becomes highly engaging. The main character is like peeling the proverbial onion, with lots of layers. The story has subplots that twist and turn and kept me entertained long after the very visual \\"written for the movie\\" part was over. I highly recommend this read.
B004I1AGTC|4.0|Donnie Yen is great in this movie. He really owns this role. I have to admit that is in not quite as good as the other two Yip Man Movies, but I would not want to be without it in my collection and you probably would not either. It is another chapter in the hardships and recovery of life. There are some very good lessons in this entire three video seriese.

0307719219|5.0|\\"Paradigm shifting analysis of \\"why nations fail.\\" It was a mind-opening and crisp analysis of why some nations achieve and maintain prosperity and how others are perpetually sub-par. Its not an apologist's diatribe but a scientific and methodical depiction of the common structural and political flaws that are consitently present in unsuccessful countries. Part economics, part political science, part social psychology, part dissection of human kind--this survey is a harbinger of what to look for in order to sustain the success of prosperous nations and a roadmap for how historically unsuccessful countries can launch themselves forward. I heartily recommend reading this book.<br /><br />Ironically, the book started really slow and shaky.  I found the author's drawing parallels and citing comparative deficiencies with Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" to be mis-aligned.  Diamond's work was looking at a completely different era and asking completely different questions.  To me, \\"Why Nations Fail\\" picked up where Diamond's works ended and did more of a \\"deep dive\\" into contemporary history whereas Diamond surveyed ancient up to the European colonial period.

B0059XTTW8|2.0|I held off reviewing this picture for a long time to see if I was doing it a disservice but my feelings haven't changed. This picture has an impressive cast and is well acted but the plotting and editing are below average. I don't have a lot of patience sifting through such things. It's the job of the people making the film to engage me, not my job to try and figure out what is going on because of poor story structure.<br /><br />Regarding that impressive cast: Gary Oldman (Smiley), John Hurt, Mark Strong and Ciaran Hands.<br /><br />The story revolves around a high level mole in British Intelligence and is arguably influenced upon the historical Kim Philby a la \\"Cambridge Five\\".<br /><br />Based on a beloved novel of a similar title by John Le Carre and a remake of the 6 hour BBC miniseries. I have read nor seen these but a few of my Goodreads friends tell me the book is stellar.<br /><br />This picture received a number of nominations, including three Academy Award nominations. It had a budget of $21M and made over $68M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: D to D plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; CINEMATOGRAPHY:<br />B to B; WHEN WATCHED: May 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C to C plus.
B000000SDB|3.0|I was short shipped on this order and received only the 9th symphony.  Thus my rating is based on the one symphony -- but it is the 9th symphony so it should have been better. Overall the audio quality was not quite up to current state-of-the-art standards; it wasn't horrible either.  Some sections were very rushed.  At one point you could tell a horn player was gasping for breath.  However, the final choral section was brilliant, and brought the whole affair to a nice conclusion.  I assume the other symphonies of the Harnoncourt set bring up the rating for this cycle, but this version of the 9th was lacking.  I compared it to my other version of the 9th by Staatskapelle Dresden, Herbert Blomstedt.  I was stunned at how much more earthy and moving the bass sections were in the Blomstedt recording.  Clearly there was something missing in the Harnoncourt version of the 9th.  I highly recommend the Staatskapelle Dresden, Herbert Blomstedt set of the 9 symphonies.

I read alot and Slammed is the first book that has been able to bring out several different emotions out of me in a long time from a book. I cried...more than a few times through out the book but what I loved, was that it also made me laugh uncontrollably through fresh tears. The poetry side of things was interesting and engaging to read, some of it making me really think. It expressed the importance and value of family which really brought it home for me and of course the relationship between Lake and Will kept me ever so eagar for more. My Summary... I loved it.

He tells it like it is....I liked that.  The drawings themselves are very free and fun and also help tell the story  - the place, from the city of New York to pictures of totally mundane items; to portraits of himself, his son Jack, his wife Patty - and how the therapy of drawing it all impacted the artist.

B0086213XW|4.0|Sarah Polley wrote, directed and produced this little Canadian Indie TAKE THIS WALTZ and it seems t be a very personal project. Polley definitely has some insights into contemporary relationships, family, commitment, and values and she manages to transmit those ideas with success in this rather strange but in the end satisfying film.  The cast is small and tight an dwell interrelated (except for a rather inappropriate shower scene at the ladies swimming pool when the shower is filled with naked unattractive older obese women) and the three primary actors who form this fragile love triangle are exceptional as are the other two main characters whose purpose seems to be an examination of alcoholism and its effects on a family.<br /><br />We meet Margot (Michelle Williams) nervously coping with her fear of airports at the end of a writing assignment for a travel company. Her eyes engage a handsome young artist Daniel (Luke Kirby) and as fate would have it they are assigned adjoining seats on the airplane home.  After an uncomfortably awkward conversation we can see that there is a mutual attraction, and on arriving home they share a taxi and discover that they live across the street form each other. Sensing her attraction and being the faithful wife that she is, Margot informs Daniel that she is married and they part ways.  Margot's husband Lou (Seth Rogen) is a stay at home guy who loves cooking and is writing a book on various chicken recipes. Though Margot and Lou repeatedly tell each other how much they love each other, their marriage of five years seems more of a silly childish game than a mature marriage relationship. There is a moment when their tiresome silly word games is interrupted by a possible physical liaison but the idea of sharing love and the concept of a child is touched upon and we never find out why that is or who is trying to have or not have a family.<br /><br />It becomes more obvious that Margot wants to be more exposed to Daniels and they play-act in strange situations, never consummating what obviously is a mutual attraction: Margot is fanatically faithful to Lou whom she repeated says she loves. The closest they come to intimacy is Daniel's responding to Margot's question `What do you want to do to me?' - and the monologue seems to reveal hidden needs in Margot. Daniel's sister Geraldine (Sarah Silverman) is a recovering alcoholic and her child with her husband James (Graham Abbey) is beloved by Margot.  The two confide in each other and words such as ¨Life has a gap in it, it just does. You don't go crazy trying to fill it¨ rather summarize the tow character's inquires.  Eventually Margot decides she must explore the newly awakened feelings she has for Daniel and the remainder of the film is how that resolves: the ending is pretty much left up to the viewer.<br /><br />Michelle Williams continues to grow as an actress, able to say more with her eyes and her body language than she is with the script of lines. She is truly remarkable. But she is very well supported by both Luke Kirby and Seth Rogen in roles that are not easy to make credible. The cinematography by Luc Montpellier adds a sense of surreal romance to the film and the musical score by Jonathan Goldsmith incorporates pop tunes such as `Video killed the radio star' have superb secondary meanings.  Parts of the film are flimsy and irritating and unresolved, but Sarah Polley proves that she is rich with ideas that makes us look at ourselves and those we love in a different light.

B000002LRX|5.0|Recently the 20th anniversary of Faith No More's fourth studio album \\"Angel Dust\\" passed without much fuss from the music world, there was no lavish remastered deluxe edition (it did get a remaster in 2008) with the original album distorted to death and 4 other discs with \\"previously unreleased\\" tracks. The truth is the album doesn't need any of these things as it is already perfect and can't be improved on, in fact the original release still sounds perfect. \\"Angel Dust\\" the second album to feature Mike Patton on lead vocals would go on to influence bands ranging from The Dillinger Escape Plan to The Scissor Sisters and plenty more in between.<br /><br />At the time of its release \\"Angel Dust\\" confused just about everybody including long-time Faith No More fans to the music press and their rather shocked record label who were expecting \\"The Real Thing\\" part 2 and another hit along the lines of \\"Epic\\" instead gone was the funk metal to be replaced by a much more aggressive sound and add to that the fact that Mike Patton had also dropped the whole nasal voice singing sound that he had used for \\"The Real Thing\\" to differentiate between Faith No More and his other band Mr Bungle. Probably the biggest influence was that it was the first album that Mike Patton would have a big input on; as most of \\"The Real Thing\\" was written before he replaced Chuck Mosley as lead singer.<br /><br />The album was worlds apart from the previous work of Faith No More and would incorporate death Metal in the form of \\"Jizzlobber\\" with its haunting synth outro and \\"Malpractice\\". There's the brilliant synth bass work on \\"Kindergarten\\". The rather suggestive lyrics of \\"Be Aggressive\\" with its cheerleader sounding chorus, \\"Smaller and Smaller\\" would feature what's now a trademark Patton shriek before breaking down in the middle into some sort of tribal synth war dance, it's just one of the many turns the album takes. There's the oriental sounding \\"A Small victory\\" which along with earlier single\\"Midlife Crisis\\" is about as commercial as \\"Angel Dust\\" would get. Opener \\"Land Of Sunshine\\" with its bass heavy sound is a great opener to the album and could only be followed by the madness that is \\"Caffeine\\" which features a Patton scream fest towards the end of the song. It's fitting that the album should finish on a cover of John Barry's \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" as you listen to it you can imagine the credits from the warped mind of Mike Patton rolling. Of course reissues of the album would include the cover version of \\"Easy\\" by the Commordes, while it's a good cover it does feel out of place on the album. The Japanese version would include a re-recording of \\"As the Worm Turns\\" which originally appeared on their debut album \\"We Care A Lot\\"<br /><br />Guitarist Jim martin who wouldn't have much influence in the writing of the album and admits he hated it and would depart the band in 1994 before the band recorded \\"King For A day, Fool For A Lifetime\\". The album didn't match the success of \\"The Real Thing\\" in the U.S but would go on to be a big seller in Europe, helped by the fact that the band would be the support group on Guns N' Roses \\"Use Your Illusion\\" world tour, before setting out on their own tour.  Over time \\"Angel Dust\\" has become a classic album and is truly appreciated for being a ground breaking album and in my opinion it's the bands best work and is truly that rare thing a 5 star album.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have read all three of Gillian Flynn's books, and by far this is the best. She never failed to keep me hooked into the story and an ingenious plot. I enjoyed every SECOND of this novel. I'd hate to see Hollywood try to make a film out of this--one simply needs to read and digest the work and not get distracted by location shots, face closeups, set designs, spooky music, yada, yada. The book will stay with you for a while after you finish it. Great summer, winter, fall, spring read--something for every season. I highly recommend it to readers who like thinking authors and like to think while they read.
0393316041|4.0|Feynman's personality is the type that you can appreciate regardless of your background. I was worried at first, thinking that I'd spend the entire book yawning, but have found myself happily mistaken.<br /><br />His stories range from small 2-paragraph anecdotes to large 25+ page tales. Some are hilarious, some just bring a smile to your face, but all of them are entertaining.<br /><br />On occasion, he does let out more of his technical expertise than most laymen would understand, but even so it comes across in no way as pretentious. As a person of no formal mathematical or scientific background, I found even his densest paragraphs readable and entertaining.<br /><br />Above all, his words are inspirational. Feynman's adventures stemmed from a simple curiosity of the world around him. As a prime example, while visiting Brazil he'd taken it upon himself to learn to play an instrument with a local, cultural band. He'd dress in cheap clothing, sneak out of his hotel, and go to his band recitals.<br /><br />And lastly as a bonus: his encounters with women do much to help fight the nerdy physicist stereotype.

Fox Searchlight was unable (and rather unwilling) to fix any issue with the old copy, which I understand since it was a second hand purchase. The rep stated that they do not make this movie any more, and that any disc on sale (even Amazon ones) are OLD as well. Extremely disappointed, I took chance and purchased a brand new copy with Amazon. Playing the movie RIGHT NOW, and it doesn't have PIP issue... I'm so happy. FINALLY!

It starts with how to handle the client at the first meeting, identifying the requirements of the case and then investigating the `nitty-gritty' detail of the issues involved.<br /><br />These often include: tracking down the assets and liabilities; questions concerning wills/intestacy and a very wide range of other ancillary matters in the contents pages.<br /><br />The third edition has been thoroughly revised.  What is particularly helpful for practitioners is the comprehensive guide to the completion of the current forms relating to Inheritance Tax and applications for discretionary orders and grants of representation.<br /><br />Legal advisers will find the CD excellent help for precedents as blueprint drafts which can be adapted for your specific cases.  Do note that the specimen forms in Appendix C have been revised to reflect changes in both law and practice.<br /><br />The book begins with this statement: \\"a legal adviser often first hears of a death in a telephone call from a member of the deceased's family\\".<br /><br />It's from this starting point that lawyers begin the delicate task of client-handling and we recommend that you read the first chapter `Making a Start' in detail for the excellent guidance and commonsense approach given throughout which is one of the greatest attributes of this thoughtful, and most useful guide.e approach given throughout which is one of the greatest attributes of this thoughtful, and most useful guide.

0415671965|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3OMM7QLWI7YC6]]<br /><br />ARE REGULATORS PULLING THE STRINGS?<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />By its very nature, the airline industry is global.  But what about the regulatory environments that govern it?  And how do these environments affect its competitiveness?  Do the differences between regulatory environments inevitably cause confusion and impair the competitiveness of this vital industry and consequently, its economic health?<br /><br />In examining these questions and so many others that affect the airline industry, author Steven Truxal -- a visiting Professor of English Law at Humboldt University, Berlin -- compares mainly EU and American regulatory environments, pointing up their similarities and differences.<br /><br />For example, European competition law and American antitrust law both define `efficiency' as enhancing consumer welfare, although their respective definitions of what exactly `consumer welfare' is tend to diverge.<br /><br />`Workable competition' in Truxal's view, is the aim of European competition rules, while on the other hand, `American antitrust law ... is supply and demand-driven.'<br /><br />What the book tends to reveal is that it is in the airline industry -- probably more than in any other -- that law and economics are most likely to be inextricably linked. This book will therefore be of interest to practitioners and academics in both fields and obviously to those involved with airlines and airports, not to mention related technical and retail industries in which the only constant is change.<br /><br />Here, the author reminds us that in the face of deregulation and liberalization within the US and European air transport sectors, a number of cooperative arrangements have been entered into by certain airlines, from franchising to mergers with other airlines, or groups of airlines, or sometimes airports.<br /><br />Referencing the somewhat startling subtitle, `Puppets in Chaos', Truxal puts forward the opinion that `before deregulation, regulators were puppets and their strings were pulled by airlines under regulatory capture'.  Now, post-deregulation,' he adds, `it remains unclear whether the regulators...or the airlines are pulling the strings.'<br /><br />`One must wait several years perhaps for the market to adjust to recent regulatory changes,' Truxal concludes, `to give airlines time to restructure and adapt...and regulators time to devise more tailored remedies.'<br /><br />Published by Routledge in 2012 as part of their Law/Economics series, this is a thorough, scholarly and thought provoking book -- copiously footnoted and extensively researched, to include a useful table of cases, decisions and legislation. Anyone involved professionally with the airline industry will find it an invaluable purchase.ling subtitle, `Puppets in Chaos', Truxal puts forward the opinion that `before deregulation, regulators were puppets and their strings were pulled by airlines under regulatory capture'.

Over the course of a few years, Scout, her brother Jem, and friend Dill grew from trying to draw out the town's mysterious citizen, Albert \\"Boo\\" Radley to learning the dark truth behind racism and hypocrisy.<br /><br />While being drawn into the anger of the townspeople at having her father defend a black man in court, Scout learns how great the weight on her father's shoulders was. The weight is shifted to Scout and Jem following the trial which brings about an unforeseen savior. From their experiences, she and her brother discover there's more to life than the simplicity of childhood and the pleasant covering their home town wears.<br /><br />A timeless classic, the underlying message in To Kill a Mockingbird is as apparent today as at any time in our history. If you get the chance, you should check out Mr. Lee's book. You may surprise yourself at how little some things have changed.
0199566569|5.0|FOR COMPETITION LAWYERS WITH CORPORATE CLIENTS, (NOT TO MENTION ECONOMISTS AND NON-SPECIALIST PRACTITIONERS)<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />There are a number of areas in which law and economics are inextricably linked; competition law being one of them.<br /><br />Additionally, as perceived by the general public, competition law has one of the highest profiles of any area of law, if only because, by its very nature, it almost inevitably involves large well known companies.  The expert authors of this timely publication from the Oxford University Press cite a number of examples from both sides of the Atlantic: among them Sotheby's, the famous Roche `vitamins' case and Microsoft to name just three.<br /><br />Cited by the publishers as the first EU competition law treatise that offers a genuinely integrated approach to both legal and economic issues, this major new work brings together in one volume the quite vast range of issues and subject areas likely to be encountered by competition lawyers and economists alike.<br /><br />The book commences with an examination of the history of competition law. Competition and monopolization originate in antiquity -- the astronomer Thales apparently had a lot to answer for over his olive oil monopoly -- but the first bodies of competition law which can be termed `modern' date back only to the end of the nineteenth century when the first piece of competition legislation appeared in North America, first in Canada in 1889 and in the US a year later.<br /><br />These two nations rules, say the authors, `had a significant influence on the design and content of the EU completion rules.' Well, that applies an interesting perspective to EU competition law, which has its particular roots in the legislative framework emanating from the original Iron and Steel community.<br /><br />This scholarly and skillfully organized book contains any amount of similarly insightful observation - especially on specific cases -- which offer their own peculiar fascination.  Here's just one quote, for example, that may occasion considerable debate:<br /><br />`Many consider that (especially following Microsoft v. Commission and Wanadoo v. Commission) those cases demonstrate the EU Courts' discomfort in matters involving sophisticated economic analysis.  To increase the effectiveness of judicial review, as well as to reduce the average duration of proceedings before the EU Courts (currently it takes 20 to 30 months for the GC to rule on a competition case), a number of observers have recently argued in favour of establishing a specialist competition court at the EU level, similar to the Competition Appeals Tribunal in the UK.'<br /><br />This of course is yet another instance of the thought provoking commentary provided by the expert authors: two of whom are competition law practitioners and academics, the other a well known economic consultant.<br /><br />Certainly the book provides an in-depth examination (from both an historical perspective as well as the contemporary standpoint) of each of the core areas of EU competition law, including horizontal agreements... vertical restraints... merger litigation and control and certainly, cartels - these being originally considered acceptable for continental Europe, but now anathema.<br /><br />For those professionally or personally involved in the issues raised in the arena of competition law, this volume, distinguished by its clarity of explanation and expression, is an enlightening read.  Ample tools for further inquiry are provided, including extensive tables of cases, legislation and Commission decisions.<br /><br />This book does emerge as an authoritative work of abiding interest to specialist legal practitioners, as well as economists and everyone involved professionally with EU competition law.

B0060AY6FO|5.0|Many authors have tried to developed a sequel to a great novel of historical standing, usually with poor results.  Remember the hoopla over the long awaited sequel to Gone with the Wind?<br /><br />Fear not, this story is awesome, from beginning to end! The characters are wonderful and I think Jane would be very pleased; with the exception of the fact she did not care for murder mystery stories herself, over look that and you have an amazing book.  I read it in one sitting it was, to me, a page turner.  After I finished it I started it again and took my time to 'really' enjoy the book.<br /><br />I hope you do too!
0199582866|5.0|FOR PRACTITIONERS IN GLOBAL BUSINESS:  A WELCOME 2nd EDITION OF `TRANSNATIONAL COMMERCIAL LAW'.<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Business is now global and so too, obviously, is commercial law, which, like the world of business itself, changes continuously.  Commercial lawyers virtually everywhere will welcome this new second edition of `Transnational Commercial Law' recently published by the Oxford University Press.<br /><br />The new edition incorporates and closely examines the numerous and diverse developments in transactional commercial law that have taken place since the publication of the first edition seven years ago.<br /><br />The work as a whole has undergone comprehensive revision to include numerous new international instruments and additional ratifications of existing conventions, so there is much new material.<br /><br />For example, in Chapter 2 the third edition of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts published in 2011 replaces the second edition.  In Chapter 3, the 2005 UN Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Trade has been added.<br /><br />There's an overview of the convention on carriage of goods by sea, road and air in a new Chapter 5... and in Chapter 6, the new codified version of the First Company Directive which deals with agency and distribution, now appears.<br /><br />We could go on, but suffice to say that the list of incorporated new material is formidably lengthy;  all the more reason why, if you are professionally involved in commercial law you need the expertise, the scholarship and above all, the authority provided by this book.<br /><br />The structure is logical.  For example, introductory text is provided at the beginning of each of the thirteen chapters which cover an incredibly wide range of subject matter, including the various relevant aspects of contract law, from international sales and carriage of goods to agency and distribution... international credit transfers and bank payment undertakings... cross-border insolvency... conflict of laws... international civil procedure and of course, much more.<br /><br />Of particular relevance to just about everyone involved in international trading is the chapter which covers electronic commerce with its `efficient alternatives to paper-based contracting' as the authors have put it.<br /><br />It seems that, predictably and understandably, the law carries on struggling to keep up with the relentless advance of internet technologies and facilities such as social networking. As the authors trenchantly admit, `electronic commerce exposes the incompleteness of legal rules applicable with the geographic limits to which technology is impervious.'<br /><br />For practitioners with internet shopping clients, the introductory text here makes for enlightening reading, together with the list of key instruments (UNCITRAL 1996 and 2011), two EC directives and all four chapters on the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts.<br /><br />In our view, this latest edition of this authoritative work, with its wealth of new material and detailed content, is an essential requirement for practitioners within this area of law, as well as those undertaking research.<br /><br />Extensive research resources abound, including copious and detailed footnoting, a lengthy index and extensive tables of cases and of statutes.

B006RUJST6|4.0|Downloaded this book because I had finished all my others and wanted something not to heavy to read before falling asleep.  I read the reviews first, and they were right, it's a great book, pretty well written for a debut novel and a good story line. The characters were good, you really warmed to them.<br /><br />I am so old I didn't even know what a slam poet was!!! But now I know...<br /><br />Fund the book surprisingle un-putdownable.<br />And I just downloaded the sequel!!

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I have this album.  It is outstanding.  I listen to it again and again, sometimes several times a day.  Often I find I'm singing it to myself.  The music is great, the variety is great, the words are great, the Jeff Lynne (ELO) production and background vocal/musical support is great, the whole thing is excellent.  I highly recommend this.  I loved the liner notes as well.  There is only one 1 million album seller so far this year. This should be the second one.
0786939532|5.0|Homeland is the jump off point into the epic that is legend of drizzt. The mythical and fantastical world of menzobarranzen is filled with many different creatures and races of beings. The action is non stop and so is the treachery. Much like lord of the rings, legend of drizzt has many different characters and scenarios. I loved the way R.A. Salvatore writes, and I think any fantasy fan will love this series of awesome stories. Dare I say it, I have a good feeling that at the end of this series whenever that will be, I might like legend of drizzt better than lord of the rings.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved everything about this book so much I got my husband to start reading them, great love story, great characters, and great great word description of the scenes is all I can say. ;)
1606865617|5.0|This is an incredibly beautiful and magnificently written first novel.  Ms. Roy paints an image-saturated canvas of India, and doesn't hold any punches either.  Sure, it skips around a bit, but always inevitably leading, leading, leading up to the devastating, and devastatingly beautiful, if horrible, culmination.  It is a haunting story of duo-zygotic twins (different fathers?, I wasn't sure) Estha (the boy) and Rahel (the girl) and the tragic consequences of meeting their beautiful half-English cousin from London.  Their mother Ammu is especially intriguing, complex, and alluring, and although I had a little trouble with the Indian family names at first, they quickly sort themselves out as the characters develop, each in their own sordid, bigoted, political, self-absorbed, and/or complex and magical way.  There is no shortage of human frailties presented here.  But if there is a God of Small Things, she sees him in the smallest of beautifully descriptive things: dust, rain, the river, fruit, foliage, sweat, blood, vomit, wood, stone, a dead elephant (as well as a live one), and the moon, among many many others.  I don't need to go to India now -- I've seen it.  Her portrayals of the characters are deep and sometimes frightening, but truly realistic and believable.  Veleutha (the heroic Untouchable) is the man whom it all comes crashing down upon (this doesn't spoil the story in any way) and who is in all respects the most tragic character, even though Rahel and Estha (the protagonists throughout) are touched for life by their own imaginative yearnings, just like their mother.  Enough.  It is a beautiful and touching story, richly drawn, and as a first novel, simply stunning.  Highly recommended.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Who doesn't remember their first crush, when the first pangs of pre-adolescent loneliness and confusion resolve into the possibility of everlasting happiness? Director Wes Anderson's \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" gives us his typically-tilted take on young love. Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) plays a scout troop reject who, early in the film, decamps from the spit-and-polish Maine island campsite run by his super-efficient troop leader (Ed Norton). Sam sets off alone, decked in Davy Crockett-style coonskin cap and armed with an air rifle, determined to rendezvous with his true love. The object of his affections, Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), is another disaffected 12-year-old who lives in lonely ennui with her doofus attorney parents, (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and her three, goofy classical-music-crazed young brothers. Suzy scans the horizon with her binoculars, obviously looking for something, or someone, to take her away from her boredom and problems. Soon, the pair of misfits has joined forces, and set off on a forest adventure while parents, fellow scouts and the island police (Bruce Willis) join in the search.<br /><br />I'm not usually a big Wes Andersen fan, but I found this film irresistible. Partly, because of the film's sometimes-cloudy plotline. Suzy's parents treat her adolescent poutiness as a sign of emotional disturbance, making them even more distant to her. Sam, too, comes from a tragic beginnings. He is a peculiar and nerdy kid (like an old college prof, he smoke a small corncob pipe filled with god-knows-what) but is essentially harmless. Sam and Suzy Set up camp in an isolated inlet, and express their love in mostly innocent ways - dancing, talking, reading to each other. Soon, we learn that her pursuers have problems of their own. Suzy's parents are having marriage problems, and the adults on the island seems to have settled for lives of quiet desperation. The search for Sam and Suzy is the shakeup that everyone needs to (maybe) shuck off old habits and take a new tack.<br /><br />Andersen's film, set in 1965 (though with a 1955 mindset) is shot in the pale hues of fade photographs. His signature cutaway houses make an appearance, as does the stilted, mannered acting style he directs onto the cast. He riffs lovingly on scouting and church theater. But what makes this film tolerable (and what was missing from the unbearable \\"The Undersea World of Steven Zisou\\") is the suffering at the core of the silliness. Suzy, Sam and the gang really are desperate for love. And it's a testament to Andersen's creative heart that he is able to hold the cute humor in check long enough to take their quest seriously.nd take a new tack.<br /><br />Andersen's film, set in 1965 (though with a 1955 mindset) is shot in the pale hues of fade photographs.

B005LAII08|4.0|As the mother of two daughters, I've seen a lot of children's movies over the past decade. And Brave is one of the good ones!<br /><br />Set in 10th Century Scotland, Merida is a Scottish princess and her parents are preparing to marry her off in a manner consistent with the times. Her hand in marriage shall go to the prince of one of the neighboring clans; the one who can best prove his worth by winning a competition in some area of traditional masculinity. But spunky Merida has plans of her own, she carefully chooses archery as the designated contest and then boldly competes herself to win her right to stay single.<br /><br />When that doesn't work, Merida follows the woodland wisps to seek her fate.  She makes a bargain with a witch exchanging her valuable necklace for a spell to make her mother understand her better.  Suffice it to say that the  result was unexpected.<br /><br />Mixing accurate historical Scotland with ancient folklore, this charming little film does a terrific job of depicting current family issues and the underlying love that provides the family foundation.<br /><br />The scenery are based on real settings in Scotland and were breathtaking in brilliant colors.<br /><br />But the thing I really loved about the film was the strong female protagonist who was both physically and emotionally tough. A heroine with a mind of her own, who doesn't need a man to complete her. These are the types of characters that I want my daughters to grow up with.<br /><br />Well-done, Pixar!!
B0041LG08U|5.0|I received this watch as a gift on my 22nd birthday from my beautiful and loving girlfriend. For anyone wondering it is the SNZH53J1 ie J1 and not K1 so it is the one with the tiny \\"Made In Japan\\" on the face between the 8 and 6 mark. Which is a good thing if you're not sure. Arrived in less than 20 hours thanks to Amazon next day shipping. Very happy. Oh yea did I mention it's a beautiful watch. Some say its an homage to the Blancpain Fifty Fathoms, either way it's beautiful.
0345803485|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.  I've got to have it, the first one left me hanging.

B006PHD0RW|1.0|This game is free on the itunes store. And not the lite version either. This was the full version so why are you guys making it free for itunes and not for kindle and android users
B0086700CM|5.0|super fun and challenging. this game stays on my android. top 3 game that I wont delete. that's considering all the games in my collection. nice job developers. thank you sirs may I have another!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  I recently learned how to play and can not put it down.... Have no problems using this app on my Kindle,  or my phone,  or my computer lol..yes I am hooked!
B00782O7NE|5.0|The movie proves you don't have to have color, dialogue, special effects and widescreen to be great.  I know there are some people here who are giving the movie one star solely because it's missing those things.  That's not a good reason to dislike a movie.  I get annoyed when I see the bad comments.  However, I have to remember that this movie, like all movies, is not for everyone.  I am happy it's received all the attention and praise and awards, which are well deserved.  It's more than I thought was possible.  It's lovely, completely moving and beautiful.  Great story telling.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|'Rome: The Complete Series' is one set that I wanted for so long. The price of this set is ridiculously expansive in Canada, $135. I was waiting the price drop, but it never happened. I am happy to get it with such good price.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|its a very fun game its just a lot of space 818 Mb its less then people are getting neat graphics
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are varied and somewhat fun. you earn points to unlock more games. I don't mind ads on free games but the pop-ups on this one are really annoying.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|If you've only heard Run the World or Countdown you will miss the true beauty in 4. A truly rich CD that has not gotten the credit it deserves in my view.  My opinion of the songs:<br />Start Over, Love on Top  (5/5).<br />Rather Die Young, Party  (4/5).<br />I Care, I was Here, I Miss You (3.5/5).<br />Best Thing I Never Had, End of Time,<br /> 1+1, Run the World, Countdown (3/5).<br />Beyonce is really talented.
0790729628|5.0|One perfect DVD! :)  It runs great and will play on the computer :)  I will definitely make more buying from you!
B006HGXGWU|5.0|This is simply, a very well done movie...with a twist. And it comes as surprise, even to the people who think they have it figured out.
B004GJYRKA|5.0|I have seen this movie on cable but the DVD is great!  Bruce Lee is the best in Martial Arts, too bad he died very young.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|First off I must say it is very nice to be able to watch Twitch.Tv. I do have a couple suggestions for the developers.<br /><br />1) Improve playback for tablet devices. 360p on a tablet device does not look very good.<br /><br />2) Allow more quality options. Often times I will pull up a stream that it is 720p+ (in a browser) only to have the stream cap out on this app at 240p or 360p.<br /><br />3) Fix the initial load. Many times when you try to open a stream it will stall and then take you back to the selection page. Once you get it loaded though there doesn't seem to be any issues.<br /><br />My device is a Kindle Fire.

1401937268|5.0|I've been a professional tarot reader for over 13 years and have used many tarot decks throughout the years, varying from the most common such as Rider-Waite to the darker, more obscure such as the Enochian. My favorite \\"go to\\" deck has always been the Mythic Tarot (another deck worth trying), but Doreen Virtue's Angel Tarot Card may rapidly become my new favorite. As I've stated, I'm experienced in tarot and thus don't need to rely upon the cues on each card. Yet, I'm very glad they are there. These cues make the deck accessible to anyone, whether you are just a beginner reader or the seeker themselves.  In so doing, I think these cards serve to debunk the mystique and \\"woo woo\\" notions that often do a disservice to the purely positive essence of intent of the tarot.<br /><br />The imagery of the cards is spellbinding, and I like the attribution of symbolic colors for each of the \\"suits\\". I particularly like that Dr. Virtue changed the image of the sword to the more accessible image of the unicorn with a sword-shaped horn, again (I'm presuming), with the intent to symbolically demonstrate tha positivity of the messages.  Dr. Virtue also doesn't subscribe to the common definition of card reversals, which are typically designated as \\"opposite meaning\\". Rather, she says that reversals are an indication that the seeker should particularly focus on the message of that card, or that the energy devoted to that particular message is lessening.<br /><br />All in all, this deck opens the doors to learning and understanding tarot to a much wider audience and will also go a long way in informing people that the tarot is a tool, guided by positive energy, and is not something to fear or judge harshly.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Really, really enjoyed this film!  Not as good the second time around, but still enjoyable to see again.  Always good to find someone who can have an original thought instead of cranking out yet another comic book, the author here definitely put his own brand on what could have yet just another \\"also-ran\\" on a theme not that different than others before it.  Will be looking for other efforts from him.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A fun, quick book that everyone at work insisted I read so that I could contribute to the lunch conversation!
0807014273|5.0|What a hard book to read to get through the pain...but this writer honestly did it in a way that was not a pity party...you really should read it...challenging and life changing...
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I purchased this book 1 minute after finishing the first book-and I enjoyed it for the most part.  The writing style get old very quickly, but the story holds you in.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Michael Lewis follow the paths of four divergent groups of people in their journey from suspicion to incredulity to realization that the level of corruption and deception in the subprime bond market was, in fact, too incredible to be believed. \\"The Big Short\\" dissects, through the eyes of the very few people who actually looked behind the curtain of obfuscation, the Big Lie that became a market so huge it dwarfed the stock market.<br /><br />As a collection of human stories, the book is both fascinating and entertaining. As an insight into how far stupidity and greed can go when, for all practical purposes, there is nobody at the wheel and no sign of culpability or consequences, it is both sobering and instructive.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006LQQ1GE|1.0|I really love the song \\"Somebody that I used to know\\", which is why I purchased the CD.  Unfortunately the sound quality is not very good, so I'm disappointed in the CD.  I have an excellent high-dollar system in my vehicle, and it still didn't sound very good.  Comparing the sound quality to my Adele or Rihanna CD is like night and day.  It sounds like a bootleg CD may sound.  \\"Somebody\\" should be ashamed.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|I assume that this author's other work is better, because I really didn't like this book. The dialog was poorly written, the characters pretty shallow, and the plot had some major logic holes. It had kind of a fun premise at first, but the second half really devolves. I didn't bother with the codas.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|I'm an avid fan of Doctor Who, and I really like this spinoff. At first, I was instantly amazed at the clarity of the show, and the realistic look. I figured out that this was because the way film is shot in Europe is different from how it's shot here in the USA. Something about the lines of resolution or some other techie gibberish. Regardless, I like it.<br /><br />I really love the story lines and the characters; however, I'm still trying to get used to how fast characters are killed off in British shows. I was first introduced to this maddening act in MI-5, and now I'm seeing it in Torchwood. Other than that, the show is a great sci-fi show.
145210655X|5.0|Funny book purchased as an end of year teacher gift.  Perfect for the Star Wars fan.  Enjoyable for all ages.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a good read this is! Will keep one reading all night, or at least, til you can no longer focus your eyes. Many twists keep the reader on pins and needles, and the outcome is never clear, until you actually reach the end.  Highly recommended for summer reading.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I played this game for hours and had fun...but what's better is that my daughter has played it for hours (quietly)...I CANT EVEN GET HER TO SLEEP QUIETLY!!! I love my daughter don't get me wrong but with two women in my life (wife and daughter) its nice to have a little peace and quiet sometimes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I don't really like any of the games that much.  The reason I can't  stop playing is that I have some wierd compulsion to keep earning points to unlock more games.  Games are all very simplistic and not engaging.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is sooo worth the 4.98!!!! If u like hunting and monster slaying games, u will love this! minecraft fans, this is just a much better version of that!! the animals, monsters, and people (and u. too)  look very real and really cool!!! best part, it will keep u entertains for hours and doesn't require internet!!!! get this game NOW!!!!!&iexcl;!!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Good character development. Believable description and dialogue. Just enough steam to keep the adult readers interested but still suitable for teens. I'm a quick reader if a book keeps me interested and I read this in 1 day
B0077DBZXO|1.0|This is purely a product review, not movie content. Why does this movie refuse to play on Kindle Fire without an Internet connection? The whole purpose of downloading to your device is to watch it when not connected. All my other downloaded content works just fine. This needs work Amazon.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was really good. I thought it might be silly or unbelievable, but as the story unfolds, it feels incredibly believable. I learned about animals and somewhat about boats and oceans. This is such a creative tale, and it certainly kept me wanting to know more, more, more. From the beginning we know that Pi survives this horrendous trip on a lifeboat with a tiger -- but it's hard to imagine how. The author does a good job explaining it all in a satisfying story.<br /><br />The beginning with all of Pi's various religions he's interested isn't really needed for the story. I kind of felt like skipping some of that, but felt it might be integral to the plot. Nope.. that part just something to read. That's was my opinion anyway.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who has not read it. I think most readers would really enjoy it. A teenager who you might want to persude to read might really enjoy it as he or she is introduced into a new, imaginative world.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I WANTED TO ADD THIS MOVIE TO MY COLLECTION.  I LIKE STORIES ABOUT ANIMALS AND THEIR RELATIONS WITH HUMANS.  WE HAVE TWO CATS AND A DOG AND WE LOVE THEM DEARLY.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|My book club picked this book when we were stumped for something to read. Truthfully, I thought it might be kind of fluffy due to the name - The Language of Flowers - but it wasn't fluffy at all. I was so surprised how intense it was with Victoria's tough life.<br /><br />She's one of those gals who needs to allow herself something good in life. Good things come to her, here and there, but she thinks she doesn't deserve them. That was frustrating to read, but made for a real-life plot.<br /><br />All in all, it turned out to be a pretty good book. Easy to read, it kept me wondering what happened in the past to Grant's mother and to one of her foster mothers. When the book ended on my Kindle, I was shocked. It seemed to end so quickly. That's a good book for you.
B005D0RDO8|1.0|It is quite incomprehensible that Amazone allows shipment of Blu Ray discs that cannot be played on European Blue Ray Players. The stores should make it clear that the items to be shipped overseas are exclusively designed for the US market and thus not playable on European Blue Ray Players.
B0086700CM|5.0|I bought this app because I thought it looked cool and I was right!  I play this all the time.  To play you swipe your finger across the screen in the direction you want to go while you try to collect coins.
B002Q4GIKE|5.0|I love this version of the movie (the original theatrical release).  I wish this version came on blu-ray instead of just the regular DVD.  I am disappointed that the only version available on blu-ray is the director's cut.  I think the director's cut includes too many extra scenes that really don't add to the story, they just make the movie unnecessarily long. If you want to watch a good movie, get this version.

0345803493|5.0|Fantastic novel! It was an excellent follow up to 50 Shades of Grey. I couldn't put it down and read it in one night! I recommend the series to only mature women however. If you have started reading the series, you know what I am talking about. If you haven't, there are often explicit sexual scenes that you should be prepared for. But if you are looking for a captivating series, 50 Shades is a great start!
B001JNNDAQ|5.0|This movie is awesome. Tons of suspense and action. Great acting by two legends. A wonderful classic that will keep you entertained until the very end.

B002QW7AJY|5.0|This is a good science fiction film. There's a lot of action, suspense, twists, and turns. The storyline makes sense and the way reveal information about past event in the movie is ingenius. Overall a great movie to watch.
0345803493|4.0|I just read another reviewer who compared this book to \\"literary crack\\" and I have to agree.  This book is markedly better than the first, although I'm not sure if that's because I've already gotten used to the poor writing style and the repetitive phrases and I'm not shocked anymore by Christian's young age and Ana's naivete.<br /><br />The book picks up 4 or 5 days after the last one ends, so I imagine the series is just one long book broken into 3 parts for marketing purposes.  It's a lot of the same, roll your eyes (but don't let Christian catch you doing it) over the top sex scenes, but this book gives a lot more character development, something that the first one was sorely lacking.  Add in some crazy ex-submissives and an introduction to Mrs. Robinson and you've got yourself a decent \\"beach read\\" that seems to be more along the lines of the naughty romance that I think was intended for the series.  You delve further into Christian's very 50 shades of screwed up past, and there's some more action and romance in this book.  I still found myself skipping over the sex scenes, since they are SO frequent and there's really only so many times that I can read about his long fingers and chiseled body (I'm more of a mystery genre reader so this is outside of my normal zone), although they were a big hotter than the first book (perhaps since there was more romance in this book).<br /><br />I think that overall, if you are expecting literary genius in this series you will be sorely disappointed.  Is it amazing literature?  No.  Is it a must read?  No.  But it is an easy, smutty, indulge in the (somewhat) naughtiness of the series kind of book, that quite frankly, is definitely \\"literary crack\\" and I can't wait until the third one is available at the library, just so I can waste a few more brain cells.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Anne not only masterfully described the circumstances she was subjected to, but also the inner turmoil of adolescence and all the issues that come with it. She has left behind a tremendous gift. She may have left this world at a tender young age, but her words will continue to touch the hearts of generations to come.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app does not make the temp any cooler BUT it is cool! and the various information tools are well thought out.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|My husband and I went into the viewing of Case Histories cold turkey. The only information I had was a description in a catalog I received through the mail. We were definitely surprised by the quality of the cases presented and the acting. It's unfortunate there are no more in this series to order.
B0088TG252|2.0|Was looking forward to the usual thrills with Denzel  at the helm, but this movie was all formula written with all the bells and whistles of an ice cream truck at the beach and requisite chase scenes, graphic gore, and body count amateurishly written for today's ADD audiences. First of all, Denzel has turned into The Mumbler - couldn't understand a thing he said several times even by turning up the sound. His presence always effuses a cool air, but he is kind of lame here. Then, there is the stone-cold-predictable Sam Shepard -one look at him, flashback to Swordfish, and VIOLA the plot is pre-solved.  One enjoyable role was his Weston's sexy girlfriend. And that's about it. I rent it first then decide to buy the DVD. Not this one. Dean Corso
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use it everyday. You can find out what the week is looking like within seconds. Love it. Very easy to navigate.
0553386794|5.0|I am quite annoyed, reading through reviewes and authors talk about subsequent books.<br /><br />For those who have only just read one book, that is quite a nasty suprise.<br /><br />Now to the book:<br /><br />This is fantasy, true, but the book deserves its place on the shelf amongst \\"serious\\" literary classics.<br /><br />The story is told in the first person, and the inner complexity of each character raises the book beyond any reproach of being a fantasy fluff. Plus, it comes with all the spoils of a fantasy, adventures, intrigues, magic, heros, multilayered plot. Reading it was pure enjoyment, despite some blood chilling descriptions of violence.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really easy to play but don't expect anything like the original.<br />I hope people still find time to enjoy the game though. especially since it's free.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Nope, that's not a good 'wow'. This isn't by far one of the worst movies I've seen. The movie does however garner a lot of nerd-rage from those expecting more from it. The problem with Prometheus is it's a big dumb movie masquerading as a thoughtful, intelligent film about the origins of our existence and the questions such as \\"What is our place in universe?\\" Personally, it makes it hard for me to give a crap about these existential questionings when I'm given cardboard characters straight out of any generic slasher film except instead of teens they're scientists who are all well out of their teens, which makes their stupid decision all the more clich&eacute;d. These supposedly intelligent and experienced scientists go around making all the basic horror movie mistakes. They're all easily broken down as, the hothead, the goofy sidekick with glasses, the b*tch (who never quite lives up to her title yet the script seems to think she does), the jerk boyfriend, the nice (boring) girlfriend and the cool guy (the pilot). The only exceptions are David, the android, who clearly has emotions yet chooses (understandably so) to hide this from his shipmates and the other 10 crewmembers who have no purpose other than to be killed off. This lack of character means you have no horse in this race.<br />The next problem is the fact that this movie has no idea what it wants to be, a generic monster/horror film or an intelligent sci-fi delving into questions of the origin of human life and the meaning of having a soul. The hybrid of these two ideas could be brilliant, instead you have a movie here that clumsily alternates between the two ruining both aspects. Don't get me wrong, I gave it 3 stars, so there are things I enjoy about the film, such as it being very good looking plus, pretty much every scene taken individually works, there are so many good moments in this film but once you put it together as a whole, it's structure with no real foundation therefore it collapses into a heap of pretty looking rubble. It's hard to really get into the problems and good of this movie without wandering into spoiler territory, so I'll leave this vague yet hopefully helpful to readers.etty looking rubble.

B004I2K4DY|4.0|I ordered this DVD on a Friday, and it showed up at my house the following Tues.  YEA!!  great job on quick shipping.<br /><br />As for the DVD.... I LOVE Alfie and Ramin. It is because of these 2 gentlemen that I purchased this.  They are AWESOME!<br /><br />As for Nick Jonas... I hate to complain, but he ruined the part of Marius for me.  He just doesn't have the power or the voice to pull it off.  And he is always staring into the lights.  The other actors try to interact with him, but he just keeps staring into the spotlights.  (He also looks like he wants to cry all the time) Oh well.<br /><br />Like I said earlier though, Alfie is perfect as Valjean and his singing just carries you to another place.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game to relax and pass the time. Achievements help motivate you to play more. Runs perfectly on all devices I've used.
B0088WK27S|2.0|I couldn't get drawn in.  Bad acting, very predictable and corny.  A lot of unnecessary plot.. way too long.  I feel like they did try and make a good movie, thus 2 stars instead of 1.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is addicting!! If you like farmville and simcity and, well, pioneering, this is the game for you. hours of fun.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Roll the Bones, Counterparts, Test For Echo, Vapor Trails, Sankes and Arrows... and now Clockwork Angels....  At first I hated all of them... And, as usual, the latest Rush album has overwhelmed me, eventually.  Been a fan since 1977.  This latest Rush recording is nothing short of spectacular.  It will require several listens before even the most rabid Rush fan gets it.  This album is incredible.  Can't wait to see it live in OCT, in Bridgeport CT...  5 stars...
B004SIPAJG|5.0|For anyone who likes \\"Dancing with the Stars\\", this movie is a serious but romantic look at the world of competitive dancing.  If you think politics have a lot to do with the outcome of the television show, you have not seen anything to compare with what actually occurs during these competitions.  The dancing and story line are just super!  I think that anyone would LOVE this movie.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle Fire. The picture is great. Gameplay is fun! Keeps you busy! Find hidden objects in different rooms.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome apps. Very fast to load and easy to use. Available offline download versions are great! Have it on my kindle and Sanding Transform. Highly recommend it.
B006OFN0BQ|5.0|I thought that this movie was awesome. i have heard of j. edgar hoover but didn't really know who he was until i watched this movie. i know that this is only a film and that they leave some stuff out and dramatize the film for story purposees but i still learned a great deal about him. like starting the fbi and making kidnapping a federal crime. this is one of leonardo dicaprio's best performances since titanic. i found this movie very powerful. it has to have some truth into it since it's based on a real person, i like true life movies. he changed the way we can find criminals and that to me is awesome. i think if it wasn't for him that some of our forensic stuff would not have happened at a early stage. this was truely a good film. clint eastwood directed a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i reommend you do
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Downloaded a sample and got sucked into the story.  I Couldn't put it down! I'd read \\"My sister's keeper\\" and really liked it.  Jodi Picoult is fantastic and I plan to read more of her work.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|This is an awesome movie, but the excorcist is still the scariest movie to my opinion. i liked how they mixed the haunted house, possesion and astrel projection genere together. i will say this about the movie it was diffrent. i haven't seen a horror movie like this one before. but i still am waiting for a horror movie to out beat the excorcist and i don't think it will happen anytime soon. don't get me wrong this was a great movie it had it's scary parts but it was more of a suspensfull horror thriller. i guess the most disturbing part of the movie to me was when josh was in his astrel spirit form looking for his son. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B007FZ7R7W|1.0|I have an \\"acquaintance\\" who is ... let's just say, challenged. This guy is cannot hold a job, cannot put together a sentence without the liberal use of profanity, has a number of \\"shorties\\" the existence of whom he seems barely aware, and ... this is his favorite CD. His absolute favorite. Listens to it all the time. Told me I had to hear it.<br /><br />It's total ... trash. I'd use some profanity myself if Amazon would allow it, seeing as how it's the only language that's really up to the the job. This is \\"music\\" for idiots. For people who cannot successfully navigate life. For people who should be in a facility with adults spooning strained vegetables and fruits into their mouths, and someone wiping up their backsides from time to time.<br /><br />It's the state of things in Obama's America. This is the soundtrack of those whose very existence depends upon the goodwill of the rest of us.<br /><br />But whatever. It puts cash in Brown's pockets, I guess.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Rock of Ages movie rocks and so does the soundtrack.  While the entire cast is fabulous, Tom absolutely rocks.  He is a rock god in this movie.  The movie is off the charts.  Total entertainment.  Just downright fun.  You walk away singing or humming the tunes. And the soundtrack rocks too.

0307352145|5.0|Are you an introvert?  Studies show that at least one third and possibly one half of people in America are introverts.  In our extrovert happy culture many pretend to be extroverts when they are not.  There is a stigma attached to being an introvert so they pretend to be the ideal gregarious and outgoing person.  Most of the institutions of contemporary life are designed for extroverts.  So it may be difficult to accept that introversion is an essential part of who you are.<br />Susan looks at our extroverted society and how we got here.  She visits three examples of our Extrovert Ideal: a Tony Robbins seminar, a class at Harvard Business School, an influential mega-church.  She examines introverts and creative thinking, lone workers and expertise, and \\"groupthink.\\"  She also looks at brainstorming (it's ineffective), jury trials, and elections.  She explains the biological difference between introverts and extroverts.  She looks at other cultures to see if all prefer extroversion.<br />She ends her book with some practical skill for extroverts and introverts alike.  She encourages her readers to stay true to their personality, no matter what type they are.<br /><br />What a great book.  I realized I am a \\"pseudo-extrovert.\\"  I am an introvert who learned to act as an extrovert because of my career and because of what I considered important.  I found that pretend extroversion can be learned - even in grade school - growing into the role so that it becomes natural.<br />I liked her comments on the state of evangelical Christianity.  \\"If you don't love Jesus out loud, then it must not be real love.\\" (70)  She appreciates worship services that leave time for silence and contemplation.<br />I was encouraged by her discussion of solitude leading to exceptional performance.  She quotes studies showing that group brainstorming doesn't work.  (87)  No wonder I like to work alone!  Multitasking is a myth.  \\"Scientists now know that the brain is incapable of paying attentionto two things at the same time.\\" (85)  No wonder I like it quiet when I study!<br />Susan's message is, \\"So stay true to your own nature.\\" (173)  Honor your own style and don't get swept up in the prevailing culture.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for the purpose of this review.

B0001XAPY2|4.0|Got this for our 10-year-old grandson. Had no idea. Just a cartoon movie, right? Kids like cartoons.<br />What a surprise. Delightful story - a fable with some pretty deep psychological implications, but something kids can get at their level.<br />Beautiful animation. The art work is gorgeous. The characters are both moving and hilarious. Deserves to be far better known.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|This processor have an amazing performance and i<br />I've nothing to complain about that. And have the cost x benefits.
B007X4ECLY|4.0|I think what surprises me about this film isn't that it's a reboot of 'Escape From LA' with a drop of '[[ASIN:B00004REZS Fortress 2]]' in the mix. Nope, it's that nearly every reviewer at this point - July 2012 - mistakenly (gleefully?) saddles this production onto the shoulders of Luc Besson.<br /><br />Unless egos have seriously dropped in Hollywood, laughably unlikely, the credit and/or failing goes to Co-Directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger.<br /><br />Not sure how, beyond a co-writing and non-executive producer credit, Besson was remotely involved with this project?<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />A decently fun flick that delivers what it promises. However, the plot holes in 'Lockout' are fairly numerous, enough to distract from making this a solid plus in the genre.<br /><br />Per the standard requisite for male actors nowadays, Pierce really packed on the muscle for the role and honestly looks fantastic. Appreciated that the co-directors allowed the character to casually wear the weight without having to resort to a shirtless scene, which can be tacky if delivered out of context, and presumably only for female exhortation. Clearly, this isn't a chick flick.<br /><br />What also lessened my appreciation is that I'm not a fan of Maggie Grace. First viewed in tv's '[[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost]]' and followed her career through various roles. And truthfully, I haven't screened a production where I felt she captured her character, bringing it to life or challenging viewers with a strong interpretation. This role is no exception. Pretty much another walk-through static effort. Unsure if this is a directorial issue or one of thespian inability. I feel there's a spark of the craft somewhere in there, and she showed a bit of it in '[[ASIN:B002PNKX48 The Fog]]', but I have yet to see it revealed on a big stage.<br /><br />As mentioned previously, there were quite a few plot incongruities and meandering threads.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />- It's never made clear whether the President is a deeply caring father willing to do what it takes to save his daughter; or if he's a disinterested spectator as suggested by Maggie's character, Emilie, who implies he's a shallow opportunist willing to sacrifice everything for political capital. As President Warnock showcases both positions, that made the high-risk rescue seem completely empty, with no real authority or sense of urgency, but simply an excuse to throw in CGI battle scenes.<br /><br />- And speaking of which, the rescue itself was ill conceived. Lack of any military experience showing here - as there's no breach team. At least not one that's either indicated by the National Intelligence Director or by simply filming them preparing for their mission. Fifteen seconds of film would have been all it took for either scenario, allowing us a semblance of a fully developed plot.<br /><br />- Minor spoilers, but the sidestory of Mace and The Briefcase seemed rather pointless given that we're never privy to the true impact of the contents. We don't need to know what's in the case, but we do need a better sense of how it plays into the overall main plot. Since it apparently doesn't - there's no satisfactory resolution from a viewer's perspective.<br /><br />-  If the math is correct, what was the deal with the other 490-something prisoners? Other than beating the crap out of the jailhouse rats - what were they doing besides standing around? Weren't any of them interested in, you know, attempting to make their own escape?<br /><br />Anyway, again a decent update of John Carpenter's work, with Guy Pierce doing a pretty decent Snake Plissken. I like to think another Mace Snow adventure is possible, but Box Office Mojo's tally numbers seem to suggest otherwise. Unfortunate. They did a pretty bang-up job with only $20 million in the budget.<br /><br />Personal Note: I'm a monster fan of both character actors Peter Stomare and Lenny James, so I was very pleased to see the pair on the big screen.g screen.

1401235417|5.0|I'll be honest; I've never really read comics in the monthly format that most fans do, but I love getting graphic novels so I get complete story archs all at once.  This is one of the best story driven Batman graphic novels, if not one of the best overall graphic novels in my collection.  Without being too spoilerific, I will say that part of the plot involves Batman descending into madness and hysteria, which I thought was fantastically compelling since he is usually such a well-grounded character.  This is one of those books I probably will be reading again.

B007XF4J70|5.0|Many reviewers rate Casablanca the greatest movie of all time.  I agree, adding The Best Years of Our Lives and The Wizard of Oz as a three way tie.  This title belongs in the dvd library of everyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice games for kids.  easy to play and earn points.  easy to kill time with.  I earn points for the grandiose and let them pick the new games to open.
B000F7CMQ8|4.0|This film had to be made.  After all, Clark Gable was THE king of motion pictures and Ava  Gardener the most sexually allureing actress in the world at this time.  So MGM made this love story.  It is very entertaining, and I recommened it.

B0088WGBC8|5.0|Action packed and great movie! Might purchase a hard copy and watch it a couple more times. Originally purchased through amazon instant video. Streaming quality was excellent.
B006UIUJ2A|3.0|I found this novel challenging to say the least. The first part as I would like to call it,  was somewhat disjointed and hard work. However, as you move through the chapters the storyline gets a lot more captivating and therefore far more enjoyable to read. One never really knows how much of it is based on fact or fiction The main characters for me lack a certain reality which I suspect was the whole point of the story.  I did enjoy it on the whole but had it not been for the fact this book was chosen as part of my book club reading I probably would not have picked it for my self.
B001FB55I0|5.0|Already had a DVD of this movie...bought the Blu ray for the improved video quality.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. The video quality on this Blu ray is excellent and consistent throughout the movie (tested on a 60 inch plasma HDTV).<br /><br />Highly recommend if you are looking for improved video quality.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|Sister is a wonderful story of sibling love, trust and loyalty. It is a well written story one which captivates the reader to complete the journey in a most thrilling manner. It has all the elements of a great crime drama but gives so much more. It is enthralling to the very last page and gripping to say the least. I thoroughly recommend it. It is a wonderful novel.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|the best book series i have ever read.  This is the only series of books that keep me guessing the entire time.  Long books but well worth the read.  couldn't put the books down.  For 2 months of my life: unless it happened in westerious or the free cities I had no clue what was going on.  Just that good!!!
B005V1WZ10|5.0|I haven't really been a big fan of Korn since Follow the Leader, but this album brought them back into my good graces.  The combination of their unique dark and low sounds with the beas and technical effects of electronica make this an awesome album.  Not very many songs on here I didn't like.  I'm glad that I heard \\"Way Too Far\\" on the radio, otherwise I would have just blown this album off as another one from Korn I was likely not going to add to my collection.  After hearing WTF, I decided to listen to the samples of the rest of the album on Amazon; once I did, I was hooked and had to get it.<br /><br />I'm a metal fan, but I also appreciate a little trance/electronica at times.  Although I still don't really group Korn in with the heavy metal genre, I think this is a big step for them and I am happy to say that they are reeling me back in as a fan.  Keep it up guys!  If you are into dark rock and electronica, definitely check out this album.<br />(Note - I don't like the definition of the sub-genre \\"Dubstep\\", so I wouldn't consider this part of that.  To me, it's more of the industrial rock sound).<br /><br />Favorite tracks - Tension, Let's Go!, Way Too Far, Bleeding Out, Chaos Lives in Everything  (in that order)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|an entertaining way to waste time when you're bored and at home or stuck at work with nothing to do
B004UNX1LS|3.0|great app when it works. sometimes the song plays and the video doesnt. makes me force close and freezes a lot. I like it but it's pretty glitchy on my kindle fire. it's free though so I can't complain much.
1612183956|4.0|Pretty decent book but have to admit the last chapter was out and out weird to me.  The story was reminding me of a Steven King, Michael Crichton collaboration with the Twilight Zone thrown in for extra suspense.  There is some very graphic violence.<br /><br />I will not make an issue of looking for other novels by this author but I can see where a lot of people would be very happy with the style of writing and story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it!<br />I'm not a big fan of dystopian novels as they usually paint a bleak future. Hunger Games is different, so different. It slips in that secret hope that within each heart no matter how dark, there is that human element. The thing that helps us put one foot in front of the other and become our brother's keeper.  This amazing book contains that inner gyro that keeps faith in humanity alive and kicking. The story begins much like that classic short story, The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, but it goes on to grab the reader and never let go. I'm ready for the next book in the series. This is really good reading!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Its a fun game. I play it alot but it needs a update. Maybe more sound effects when you win the game.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|ok, so I got this book due to all the HYPE.. I was and am disapointed and have read better. It is sooo sllooowww getting to anything!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a awesome and idicting game I recimind it if you like running games the farther you go the harder it gets
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book is just what it is being touted to be - erotica and nothing more.  Story line pathetic.  Even worse than a Mills & Boon storyline because the writing is so atrocious.  Typical poor, innocent girl meets rich, sophisticated man and of course he falls for her.  Storyline goes nowhere.  Read this a couple of months ago now and haven't being inclined to read the second.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|Well worth the $10-$15 you pay.  The movie never gets old and the quality of the blu-ray is worth the money.
B00005OM4K|3.0|The truth is that you know all their greatest songs by heart already. That's not to say that there isn't a lot of really good stuff on here, and the early recordings are a cool look into the development of genius, which without question John Fogerty is. And certainly having all those incredible hits available at your fingertips is the reason to obtain box sets in the first place. But I guess I was hoping for a miracle, That in the wake of that awful court decision ruling in favor of Fantasy, and especially the subsequent airing of all those afternoon television commercials selling greatest hits albums, that somehow there still would have been a few Travelin' Bands, or Green Rivers, or Fortunate sons lost &#34;Until Now!&#34; to treasure, but that's just not the case. Honestly, at thirteen years old I was blown away by the sound coming out of my TV when those commercials came on, and I still haven't heard anything like it. CCR are one of the greatest bands in the history of rock and roll and I am happy to have this, but I was a little disappointed that I already knew a lot of the material.
B00004TH83|4.0|As always, Fabian delivers with all her heart and soul. She does not merely sing; she lives the song, she becomes the song; quite extraordinary, really. So, why only 4 stars? I have most of her recorded work, CDs and DVDs, but the selection of music for this one could have been better. Perhaps because this English language release was aimed at American audience, songs here are all of the typical pop music repetitive beat. It fails to demonstrate Lara Fabian's versatility. With the exception of Adagio, I Am Who I Am, & Broken Vow, the insistent \\"American\\" beat is simply overwhelming. Her foreign language recordings are a much better showcase of her repertoire.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL delivers exactly what you expect a film of this kind to do--entertain the masses, especially action fans who like all those cool gadgets, all those stunts from high places, and all of the twists in plot that keep the story spinning between each new outburst of violent action.<br /><br />As usual, the mission is to prevent a nuclear device from destroying and vaporizing an entire population in an exotic locale. This time Ethan Hunt has Benji (Simon Pegg) for comic relief, Paula Patton as Jane Carter for a curvaceous female co-agent, and Jeremy Brenner as the troubled agent who's hiding something until the reveal.<br /><br />But it's not the plot that really carries the film. It's the outstanding use of picturesque locales combined with the danger of stunts that look amazingly as though nobody could have survived the making of the film. Cruise's spiderman stunt on a high tower glass skyscraper is something to see, as are many of his \\"chase and be chased\\" stunts.<br /><br />To enjoy this sort of thing you have to ignore the credibility gaps in the story and simply dwell on the action-filled sequences, some of which look absolutely amazing. The photography is first rate, especially clever at capturing a frantic chase through a sand storm and other such perils that look like a danger to life and limb.<br /><br />Tom Cruise still looks fit enough to handle most of his stunts and does so with an intensity he always projected as the daring agent. All in all, the film is an example of how to put together an action film with few lulls in its long running time, and one that is sure to please the masses.<br /><br />One of its saving graces: no shaky camera as in the \\"Bourne\\" films.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I liked the design, it being an automatic... But I ended up returning it. My first impression was that it was very small. I don't have big wrists (around 6,6'') and thought it looked too small. A woman or a child could wear it without a problem. Another problem for me was the numbers being too small.<br /><br />So beware. It looks very nice but it is very small.<br /><br />I also wanted to add that Amazon is great with returns, and I will pay $15 more for a watch here than at a different site knowing that they'll take take of me if something should go wrong.

B004ODLUGM|5.0|I had never heard of \\"The Gruffalo\\" until a few weeks ago when it was recommended \\"based on my personal preferences.\\"  My preferences being \\"what the kids like that I actually enjoy too\\".  Well, most of what my kids like I merely tolerate.  Not \\"The Gruffalo\\".  If they are watching, I feel compelled to watch too.  It's such a clever little story, with its rhymes, thought balloons (how do you imagine Owl ice cream?), and imagination interludes (how would a mouse imagine an invitation to lunch by a fox?)  Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful as the mother, conveying a warmth that is rare in a cartoon.  It still makes me laugh or smile, even though I've seen it many times now.  I love that it is short (about half an hour) because sometimes we just want a little something before bed or while waiting for dinner to cool.  Now we need to get the book!  =)

0061692042|4.0|The author of this book has the unenviable task of following his highly engaging trilogy, THE SPORTSWRITER, INDEPENDENCE DAY, and LAY OF THE LAND, featuring the likeable, middle-aged Frank Bascombe. Frank has normal problems with relationships, family, job, health, etc, but his thoughtful, overall approach is fairly hopeful. However, in a significant departure, the startling, abrupt, and disconcerting events that fifteen-year-old Dell Parsons experiences in this latest book strike a decidedly different tone in regard to the predictability and benevolence of life.<br /><br />The story begins in Great Falls, Mont in 1960 where Dell lives with his father Bev, mother Neeva, and sister Berner. Only the thinnest of veneers covers up a dysfunctional family. His aw-shucks, Alabama father Bev was forced to retire from the Air Force and thinks getting ahead involves smiling and shaking hands: hoodwinking others. While his Jewish mother, a small rather unattractive woman, thinks of herself as intellectually and culturally above the locals and her husband. His twin sister has essentially distanced herself from them all. Slowly and painfully, one of Bev's schemes unravels to the point where a loony idea to rob a bank results in his and Neeva's arrest and the complete destruction of their family.<br /><br />Looking back on this situation fifty years later, in the very start of the book, Dell establishes a tendency towards understatement that permeates the entire book, by merely noting that his parents had committed a robbery and that the course of his and his sister's lives had been altered - to say the least. Dell is transported to Canada after his parents are arrested where he leads a rather dismal, lonely existence and encounters others with hidden afflictions, only waiting to explode.<br /><br />The book is essentially one long commentary on the presence of criminality in all of us: can it be detected and ameliorated or will it inevitably find an outlet with wide repercussions. What is apparently implausible can quite easily become the plausible. In addition, the author is concerned with to what extent normality, especially relationships, can be restored.<br /><br />There are commonalities with the earlier trilogy. All are somewhat prolonged, loaded with reflections and understandings on all manner of subjects. However, the author's careful, precise, and insightful wording results in stories that effortlessly flow. In contrast to Bascombe, Dell, as a teenager, is not nearly as believable in his calmness and ability to cope when facing a series of quite dramatic, abrupt events. It will be interesting to see if Frank Bascombe fans can truly embrace this latest book.s. What is apparently implausible can quite easily become the plausible.

B000AQJPQE|5.0|I used the solar system in my sons space room and it finished the decor off perfectly! The only thing that would of made it better would be if you could use it as the main light in the room. It was cheaper to get this product shipped from Amazon (America) than from my own country Australia where I live! Thank you I love it.
B005LAII08|5.0|Thankyou Thankyou BRENDA CHAPMAN.!! It was set in Scotland. The graphics were Beautiful with the country side & the characters. The voice acting for the characters was Great. Their Scottish accents were fun to hear. Kelly McDonald who voiced Merida was Exceptional. I don't know if they give Academy Awards for voice work. She sure deserves one. I was suprised by the story. When her Mother turned into a bear. Her Mother was a Delightful bear. Emma Thompson also did a Great job as Merida's Mother. I also liked Merida's Father. He really loved & supported Merida in whatever she wanted. He was just trying to keep peace with the Queen. This Film was Flawless.. It is a classic. Hundreds of years from now. When many of the films that come out in this time will be long forgotten. This film will still be held up and cheered.  All the Princess films I have Ever seen. She finds a Prince & marries & lives happily ever after.  At the end of this film instead of riding off into the sunset with a Prince. Merida is riding off in the sunset happily with her Mother. Bravo for individuality, choice, change in her Mother, love & about family. I loved this film. I Highly Recommend this film..! This is a One of Kind Unique Princess, Mother & Family movie. GO See it For Yourself..!
0307744434|2.0|i am half way into this book & I am still waiting for the plot... although..beautifully written detail... but I am losing interest : (
0679411585|5.0|\\"It was early March of 1970, and the weather was damp with a trace of snow on the ground.  Since I had no means of transportation, I walked around the bend of Wurzburger Strasse in the early morning mist of a drab Monday morning. I walked onto Graves Kaserne, which housed the entire First Battalion, Seventh Infantry unit; I was heading to meet Lieutenant Colonel Dillon, the battalion commander.  All incoming officers must report formally to the commander, and they have to endure the traditional \\"Welcome-to-the-greatest-unit-in-the-army\\" soliloquy.\\"  These words come directly from my book I co-authored with my army buddy Bob Toto titled \\"In Our Duffel Bags, Surviving the Vietnam Era.\\"<br /> The significance of the above paragraph is that Colonel Dillon was the S-3 officer for LTC Moore's 1st of the 7th Cav.  At the time of the Battle of the Ia Drang it was November, 1965.  Fast forward four and a half years later; Lieutenant Colonel Gregory P. (Matt) Dillon had command of the 1st of the 7th Infantry which was part of the 3rd Infantry Division located in the Zone of West Germany.  Since writing our war memoirs I've since been reading a lot of material on the Vietnam War, after forgetting most of it for over forty years.  I never knew that my commanding battalion officer was a very instrumental and heroic officer at LZ Xray.<br /> First of all, the very concept prior to the battle of the Ia Drang Valley of air mobile assault was an untested theory.  After the battle it became doctrine written in stone as how to conduct operations in Vietnam.  The troopers of the 7th Cav were trained in the techniques of airmobile assault at Fort Benning Georgia.  Their uniforms which signified the typical fatigues that were worn in CONUS (Continental US) Europe and Korea shows to all that this unit was one of the first units to go to Southeast Asia.  The basecamps erected by the 1st Cav Division looked to be temporary tent cities very reminiscent of WWII temporary camps.  Later on in the war the base camps would be made heavily sandbagged structures complete with outhouse latrines and rainwater showers.  The uniforms would also change drastically and the troopers would be wearing the lighter weighted jungle fatigues and the newly designed canvas upper jungle boots.<br /> The troopers of the 1st of the 7th Cav would be led by the highly competent LTC Harold G. Moore.  These troopers were well trained and Moore's officers were of a very high level.  Their mission was what was to be a familiar phrase to all infantry officers who served in South Vietnam and it was to \\"search and destroy the enemy.\\"  The enemy was found soon after landing at LZ Xray.  This LZ had the capabilities of holding 8 slicks when landing and extracting troops and equipment.  Moore and Galloway tell the brutal story of how they held the LZ for three days and were able to direct in field artillery and air support on the surrounding NVA.  The 7th Cav with a force of about 450 men were able to hold off an NVA force of 2500 men.  Using the choppers for support and medevac operations the 7th Cav proved to all that they could indeed contain and beat the forces of the well trained NVA.<br />  The stories told herein, show the professionalism and heroics of not only the lst Cav but also gets into the mindset of the North Vietnamese.  It shows the true dedication of the revolution techniques of the North Vietnamese.  As well as the Americans fought in Vietnam the North Vietnamese knew that we would tire of it.  In fact General Moore faced these facts way back in the early days of 1965.  He knew that the North Vietnamese were a tough and savvy opponent and that the US severely constrained themselves by not going and pursuing the enemy when they escaped to Cambodia.  The war as fought with these so-called rules could never be won.  Moore understood this early on.<br />  This book represents many things.  It shows to us that the US brought air mobility to the battlefield.  It showed to allthat it could maneuver from above the tough jungle terrain of Vietnam.  Something the French lacked was the ability to maneuver, so they lost on the battlefield.  The US did not lose on the battlefield, however as Ho Chi Minh knew we would tire of the war no matter how many of the North Vietnamese and VC we Americans killed.  So therefore we left the battlefield in 1973 and the weak ARVN were left to their own devices, which I may add we supplied them.  They quickly lost these devices and they indeed lost the war in 1975.<br />  Moore's book is a classic which shows the brutality and yes some of the senseless management of men at war.  Moore and Galloway show respect to the troopers who fought in that war and they convey what the effects of that major battle were and how the Vietnam War was to be fought in the future.  It also shows our hubris and tragic decisions which led to the ultimate tragedy that was the Vietnam War.  This book should be read by all who want to know about the battle, the Vietnam War and perhaps how to prevent such tragedies in the future.that it could maneuver from above the tough jungle terrain of Vietnam.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Great album; so I'll have to disagree with some of the negative comments I've seen posted here.  Perhaps the album suffers a bit from the order of the songs where there are several towards the front with similar \\"soft starts\\", but otherwise the music and lyrics are great - a little bit of everything is in here - including some great guitar work for which I am always ready.<br /><br />I am glad they still enjoy making new music and I never tire of hearing it.  One thing I wish they would consider is another long one - Hemispheres was a long time ago guys!!!
0061906220|5.0|My two and four year old LOVE this book. They have memorized the words and now want all of the Pete the Cat books.

B005FITIIC|5.0|A lot of the negative reviews seem to be from people who expected this to be a documentary.  It does not claim to be that.  It is based on the Lehman Brothers collapse but does not attempt to analyze it or even explain it in much detail.  In fact, it only covers about 36 hours of the meltdown.  This film is a work of dramatic fiction that follows a group of people who are facing the realization that their current prosperity is based on a house of cards and is about to undergo a \\"correction\\" that will fundamentally change their lives.  And the change will not come in weeks or months, but that very day.<br /><br />The point of the film is watching that group of people deal with the crisis on corporate and personal levels; often having to make some very unsavory choices.  The film's high quality comes from the script, which moves forward inexorably as the scope of the disaster becomes clear, and the fine group of actors, who deliver some excellent performances.  I would say there is only one false note in it: Paul Bettany teetering on edge; but I still consider his to be one of the standout performances.<br /><br />Some reviewers complain that the film is boring.  I have always been somewhat fascinated by Wall Street, so I cannot evaluate that claim.  When I saw it on pay-per-view I thought it was riveting.  In fact, when it was over I restarted it and watched it again.  But there is very little technical detail in the movie.  I think even people whose eyes glaze over at any mention of financial instruments will find this movie rewarding.<br /><br />In short, if you are looking for a documentary, you will be disapponted.  Likewise, if you are looking for car chases, fist-fights, or moralizing feel-good endings, this will not be your cup of tea.  If you like good scripts and fine ensemble acting, check it out.
0439023513|3.0|Better than the 2nd book, a bit lackluster compared to the 1st, in terms of plot in degree of engagement. Nonetheless, it does carry a good message on war and peace (which credits should be given to the Collins as being young adult category, one doesn't really expect much of a message).
1401233791|5.0|Just like the title says, this was one of the best Batman stories I've ever read!  It starts with \\"Vingence of Bane\\" and when Azreal takes over as the new Batman!

B0086QS7N2|5.0|I've been a Rush fan since 2112.  These guys are the greatest band ever.  They've had their slumps, but Clockwork Angels is an amazing album.  I use the word album in a totally digital world of pick and choose. The collection of songs sets a mood and tells a story start to finish.  It is understated greatness.  The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame can suck it for snubbing this band for so long.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is a total waste. It is a ripoff of the themes and elements of the \\"Fifty Shades\\" series. The characters have no chemistry. All they talk about is sex and there is no relationship development beyond sex. I hated this book and the author should be sued for blatant plagiarizing. It made me sick to read it. No real abuse victim would act the way the girl did in this book, not even with years of counseling. NO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH.

B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|I read the article in revolver magazine and even on the cd itself, there is a sticker that boasts its their most powerful cd since hybrid theory. Compared to their last cd, miley cyrus is powerful. I agree with colts35. After hybrid and meteora we all were hooked and that's the LP we hope for with every new release. Time and time again its just another letdown. It is possible to evolve while still keeping your trademark sound. Many bands have done it. Sadly this is not one of them. If you loved linkin parks first two cds, I highly recommend you check out A LIFE DIVIDED. You wont be disappointed.

B0088TG252|2.0|This movie screams Bourne Identity. They  merely substituted actors and actresses. The sound track feels like a ripoff of John Powell's tracks. Think of the similarity to Joan Allen, Brian Cox, Albert Finney, and Chris Cooper--just uncanny. And, as in the Bourne Trilogy the movie is chase with little dialog that makes any sense.<br /><br />'Safe House' is a good Saturday afternoon diversion and not much else.

1936608898|5.0|There are so many great things about this book, but I think my very favorite is the tough-love approach. Excuses bug me. I think Dallas and Melissa are Gentle yet firm in the way they explain the changes that need to be made for successful health. It's the prodding some of us really need to take that first step toward optimal health and away from sickness, lethargy, and misery.<br />They also address something not many other books do: our relationship with food. They don't go on and on about how you just need more willpower blah blah blah. They acknowledge that food plays an important role in our memories, our culture, and the way we feel. I love that they don't ignore that fact.  I have a hard time with disapproval of others, and would rather avoid conflict, and they touch upon how to deal with friends and family who are \\"less than supportive\\" of your health goals.  That was HUGE for me.  They also address that god-forsaken scale. They missed NOTHING.<br />Thank you for writing this book, Mr. and Mrs. Hartwig. It has changed my life,my relationship with food,  and the lives of those around me.  Go get your copy. You'll be thanking them too.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book blows.  I thought it was really going somewhere with the original back story they gave the female lead - a back story that was good enough to overlook the annoying \\"Pidge\\" nickname the male lead gave her.  By the end, I was disgusted.  They wrapped it up with a happy little bow (and a ring) but I'm sure the sequel would be all about \\"Pidge\\" and her (blamless, innocent) children escaping from the violent life she built with \\"Trav,\\" the obviously mentally ill \\"bad boy.\\"<br />If you let your YA read this book, do so only to illustrate what type of boy she should avoid at all costs.
1400082773|5.0|Dreams of My Father is one of the greatest books written in American history. It is primarily a story of a young mans search to find the meaning of his life. On that journey he discovers that he can create the experiences he desires to have by using his imagination. Barack Obama discovered early that life did not place him in the best situations.    He did not become bitter. He continued to dream of something better for himself. He began to realize that he was not simply a bystander waiting for things to happen to him in life, but that he had the power inside himself to have things materialize as he desired.    Once he discovered this power he would never become a victim of life circumstances. Obama discovered that most people have difficulty accepting, that is, we are divine beings and have the power to create our own experiences. As the Buddha reminded us, we are the results of our thinking. Especially the thinking we have of ourselves.    After Obama discovered that he possessed such power, he was able via this thinking to imagine the life he wanted for himself and his family. In so doing, he was able to grasp the reigns of the world's most coveted position, the American Presidency.  Where he goes from here . . . .    Douglas E. Thomas, Ph.D. [[...]]]

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I know what you're thinking.....OMG why can't my husband be more like Christian Grey?! Well, there are a few reasons. First, you're fifty so that puts your husband around the same age. Also, your husband is a plumber and doesn't know how to fly a glider....or a helicopter. Actually, he can't even drive a stick shift. I'm also pretty sure he doesn't create sexual tension by making you wear benwah balls to that Chinese food place you two crazy cats frequent every other Friday. I'd also like to point out that Christian Grey not only flies gliders, he does barrel roles with them. Your husband fixed my faucet the other day and I can tell just by looking at him he can't do that. I know it may seem like your husband is boring but he's been your source of security and love for the past thirty years. Are you really ready to throw that away on some twenty-something billionaire who lacks life experience and has mommy issues? I didn't think so.
B00007K02F|5.0|Franco does not lie to himself in this screenplay. To adapt so rich a novel in under 2 hours is, of course, absurd. There are many versions in film of this story and, obviously, as many interpretations. Each, because they are adaptations, invariably become something quite independent of the novel. This version is no exception. However, this version doesn't so much \\"take liberties\\" with the story as it does retell it in a unique manner. Here, the focus is much more heavily placed on the tormented love of the two primary characters. Although William Hurt always appears stiff in scenes of embracing, he none the less delivers a fine performance. The casting for young Adele is sweet and very endearing. As for Mrs. Fairfax, one would have to search far and wide to find an individual who does not adore the talented and seasoned performance of Joan Plowright. Finally we are left to the performance of Ms. Gainsbourg as Jane. I have noted that if you are already a Charlotte Gainsbourg fan, you will like her in anything she does. This movie is no exception. Although even more subdued than Bronte's novel character, Gainsbourg delivers. If you are not a purist and can tolerate Francos screenplay, you will find Charlotte Gainsbourg sublime!
0606259090|1.0|I don't even know where to begin. Normally, I want the protagonist(s) to win, succeed or find happiness but here I found myself wanting them to just die. Just die and end the misery. I was thinking Charlie Tango could've tangoed into the sea or mountain or an apartment complex. Every new page I found myself wishing that I never learned to read.....that I was absent that week at school.  When I picture Christian Grey, he's like in his 40's because a bilionaire in his 20's would require Charlie Tango to crash into the sea to make up for the fact the author thinks I'm an idiot. Even more disturbing, all the women I work with have to practically walk around with toilet paper wads in their pants and then I have to shatter their dreams by telling them that real BDSM is alot less romantic and involves anal. Oh Charlie Tango! Where are you when I really need you?
B0045EJY90|1.0|I worried about purchasing a TEAC CD-P650 compact disc player after reading some of the negative reviews regarding quality, and my experience suggests that quality concerns are indeed a serious issue.  The unit arrived in a sealed box from the seller, but it simply didn't work.  As was the case for some other reviewers, it couldn't read any CDs, not even brand new commercial ones.  On another issue, there is no mention in the documentation or manual of a Burr-Brown 24-bit DAC as advertised. In fact, some sellers and a professional reviewer state that this unit delivers music via a 1-bit DAC.  I asked TEAC for clarification of this, but haven't received a response yet. On the positive side, Amazon has issued a refund and will take back the defective CD player.

1595828753|1.0|I am a huge fan of the Avatar - The Last Airbender and it pains me to say that The Promise (1 & 2) contains a weak and unconvincing story. Let's say it didn't keep the promise. The original animated series spoiled us with a lot of wisdom and character building and situations that kept us interested and wanting more. I was sort of expecting some of that to rub off this graphic novel. The character's actions and goals are inconsistent with their personalities as illustrated in the animated series. Zuko is asking his father ( a bloody dictator that ruined people's lives) for advice? Aang is calling Katara sweetie? The conflict between Toph's team and the other guys seemed far fetched as well.<br /><br />Art wise I would give it a 4 or 5.<br /><br />The bottom line is this. The writers had to come up with something much better. Spend your money on something else, buy the animated series, and if you are looking for some good graphic novels check out others that have good art, better stories and more pages: The Amulet, Bones, Bad Island etc.

B0015AARJI|1.0|This is the same 11.99 piece of junk u cat get from e something games only they r honest enough to let you know what your buying is a fake. Seriously don't buy new off here. If you've ever had a real ps3 controller you know as soon as you get it out of its counterfeit box ur not holding one. I like how none o the pics show the writing on the back, not that I looked when I was buying 2. Look Urs might work fine, mine new, r worse then my 2 others that are 3 years old. But if your going to pay money for this junk pay a lot less somewhere else.<br />If you take pride in your equipment being as good as you can get then, well I'll be buying my accessories from Sony, feel free to join me.<br />Checked eachgame.com. Lil under 9 bucks each. Seriously I got these at a great discount with free shipping to get useless cheap pieces of garbage for what bout 70 over 18 from eachgame. Reason I've never bought crap that sells fr 9 dollars before this order is because I wasnt lied to about what I was buying. Threw them off my balcony onto the street because I wouldnt want to return that garbage n have someone else be tricked into buying them. Light worthless garbage carried too far n they ended up across the street in the grass so obviously I went n got em to try again.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Bought the CD in preperation to seeing the band live in concert!  The disc has a great mix of songs -- all the hits from the 80's but even the cuts I hadn't heard are excellent.  Huey Lewis and the News blend great vocal harmonics with a huge variety of instruments.  And yes -- they still have energy and they sounded great live in 2012!  This CD is worth every penny!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great collection, and i am excited to have discovered this author. Buying more of his books to take on my vacation. Excited to discover his other books, and new installments of wool!
B006ISJQ1W|3.0|Okay, here is the plot line of the film under review, the adaptation of the late Hunter S.  Thompson's legendary (more later on that) The Rum Diary, straight out of the gate. A young aspiring American writer, of the male persuasion, Paul Kemp, played by Thompson pal Johnny Depp, seeks employment in the newspaper business down in then backwater colonial Puerto Rico in the late cold war red scare early 1960s. Said writer, working to win his spurs and to make a name for himself tries six ways to Sunday to upgrade himself as a professional and the newspaper as well (based on a real the San Juan Star of the time). Oh, and chase a few windmills to right some of the egregious wrongs of this world as the young are prone to do (the major wrong confronting him being  double-triple rip-out of the place by hungry, very hungry real estate developers).  Problems encountered in chasing those windmills: said budding journalist is a bit of a drunk, a bit too close to some ex-pat fellow journalists who gravitated to PR just to be flaky in peace, and a bit too close (but one cannot blame him on this one) to one very hot blonde who happens to be slumming in Puerto Rico just then. But, trust me, one Paul Kemp will straighten that whole thing out, or have us go mad trying.<br /><br />Sound familiar? Well, for any Hunter Thompson aficionado, and count me as one, hell, any half- aficionado, this plot line is very, very much like the life, the early life of one Hunter S. Thompson. And how would we know?<br />Well we have read the letters, we have read the Rolling Stone articles, hell we have read Songs of the Doomed and got a taste for snippets of The Rum Diary there. So when viewing this film there was a certain disappointment  (just a little) that this did not turn out to be the great film adaptation of  Hunter Thompson's stab at the great American novel.<br /><br />And here is where the \\"more later\\" mentioned above on The Rum Diary comes in. Hunter Thompson, seemingly, spend endless hours as far back as the early 1970s (maybe earlier )trying get this novel published (and in publishable form), and into film form. But here is a case where life (his, his later life anyway) outdid fiction. The ambience of the film seems very dated, very dated indeed in the post-Doctor Gonzo age. For what it is worth this is my \\"skinny\\" on Thompson's career. He was one of the premier journalists of the last half of the twentieth century but as a novelist he was well behind his heroes Fitzgerald and Hemingway. As for Johnny Depp's performance, well, Johnny Depp knows, knows deep in his bones, how to play off-the wall characters and does a better job, a much better job, here than in his attempt at channeling Hunter Thompson in the film adaptation of  Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. Selah.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|So I just finished the first and I am anxiously awaiting the second two books to arrive. I find many of these reviews amusing. I just have a hard time figuring out how so many people who hate this book so much, sat through the entire book. Or worse two of the books, or even the entire trilogy!!! Really? Come on folks. Get off your high horses! It's a BOOK for goodness sake! It doesn't have to perfect. A lot of people like to read something not so perfect that gets their mind off the everyday hum drum and stresses of life. Sure the writing is repetitive but who cares????? E.L. James is making a whole lot of money with this set so she must of done something right!!!! I hate to see other people bashing other's work because. It's so simple...If you hated it so much, you could of put the darn book down after the first chapter or so. Then you could of saved the rest of the world from your pity complaints!!!!<br /><br />As for me. I'm a young, educated, professional, single mother who enjoyed having a fun, carefree, entertaining read. I was interested in the relationship of Ana and Christian and interested to see where it would lead to. Again, the language and writing is repetitive at times but I could over look it. Several but short (and pretty mild in my opinion) sex scenes that at times, I was thought, \\"ugh again?\\"....but because they were so short, it wasn't a big deal. Other than that, I thought it was entertaining which is all I'm sure the author intended this to be.
B007MDQW3W|4.0|I am always excited yet nervous everytime a favorite artist of mine (in which i love every one of their albums) comes out with a new album.  Because, as in the past, they always end up so weird and different or worse, more 'pop' like.  I am happy to say that this album did NOT disappoint!  There was just a couple songs that i haven't really got on board with, but the rest are all great.  Absolute favorite song: \\"How\\", so sad and so sweet!!
0761169253|5.0|A friend showed me this book and I what'd to get it for myself...then I gave that copy away and had to buy myself another copy...which at some point I am likely to give away ... whereupon the process will start again. The book is well written, to start, and it delivers a message that is quite liberating - that art, be it painting, photography, writing ... whatever, is a cumulative process.  The more you try, the more you take in, the more you experience, the more you can bring to what you do...it is OK to try a lot of things, or read about them, or to see exhibits or go to concerts outside of your chosen discipline...all information funnels down into that creative place where you can make something that is of you.  Art comes out of doing, not sitting in a garret somewhere waiting for inspiration to strike...and it is a fun book to read as well.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The title says it all! I'll prob read these books again in the future! I liked books 1 and 2 better than book 3, but all were intriguing!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love Temple run! and despite the slight glitchyness of this app, I still find my self playing it fairly often.
B00633W614|4.0|The continuation of the Clifton saga is a great read. The abrupt end leaves us hanging until the next next installment is released. The characters are engrossing and believable. This is a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Archer writes excellent, engrossing stories.

B0079IJ0R0|5.0|Prequel: Amazon has correctly listed this review of Carmen with Alagna and Garanca  but also wrongly under Gades Carmen (flamenco dance drama).<br />Unfortunately this sort of double listing is quite common as Amazon's listing software seems to get confused by similar titles.<br />Reviewers are unable to do anything about this so please be patient and scroll to the performance that you are interested in.<br />Thanks, Ian Giles.<br /><br />.................................................<br /><br />Now that this is finally also available on Blu-ray, many would rate this as the strongest contender for overall best buy especially as it pairs two of the finest singers available today in the key roles of Carmen and Don Jose.<br /><br />Both Garança and Alagna naturally dominate this production, and as they comment in their brief interview between acts, they both feel that their earlier experience of working together on Carmen in London has enabled them to further develop their working relationship. The result is clear to see as there is an unusually high degree of dramatic tension created between them throughout this production.<br /><br />In this performance Garança shows Carmen to be effectively focussed on her abilities to generate straightforward sexual desire in men she fancies and, as such, portrays a readily identifiable character type which will be fairly familiar. When apparently spurned she simply wishes to turn her attention to alternative options. This Carmen does not display the same level of inherent vindictiveness to be found in van Otter's Carmen at Glyndebourne or the violent unpleasantness portrayed by Antonacci at Covent Garden for example. This remains a very strong and believable portrayal of Carmen in its own right however and one that Garança clearly revels in.<br /><br />Alagna is on top form here and gives a fine performance of a role that he has been closely identified with for years. As mentioned above, the previous on-stage partnership with Garança in Carmen has allowed a further deepening of the Carmen/Don Jose relationship which adds considerable veracity to this production.<br /><br />The remaining roles are also well done with Barbara Frittoli an especially believable Micaela and one that Don Jose might well have been happy with under better circumstances. She is a stronger and more attractive portrayal than many rivals in a difficult role to project. Teddy Rhodes delivers an effectively self-possessed Escamillo with a suitably strong voice and matching characterisation. The remaining supporting roles are all of the same uniformly high quality.<br /><br />The setting of this Carmen is noticeably less sumptuous than either the Glyndebourne or Royal Opera productions which are particularly strong in creating apparently historically accurate and detailed scenarios. This Met production, although effective in its own way, does not really match either of those rival performances. Given the excellence of all three productions as regards both singing and acting, this may be a key matter for consideration for some. Nevertheless, apart from that consideration, no-one should be disappointed with this Met production.<br /><br />In summary, both Alagna and Garança are both on top form and achieve real dramatic intensity together. They are given excellent support from the rest of the cast and the orchestra under the talented Nezet-Seguin. The camera work is involving and of good imaging quality and the sound is presented in clear DTS-HD plus stereo quality. The usual Met backstage interviews and comment form the bonus material.<br /><br />As mentioned in the title to this review, there are now three fine modern but contrasting Carmens for purchasers to choose from. All three are capable of generating enthusiastic support seen from their differing perspectives and will satisfy a considerable range of personal tastes and responses. All three are worth the full 5 stars in my opinion. Final choice will thereforebe a matter of personal preference which must lie outside the scope of this review.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />A note to the anonymous negative voter:<br /><br />The voting system is specifically only about reviews being 'helpful' or 'unhelpful'<br />Goodness only knows what you find to be `unhelpful' about this review.<br /><br />A negative vote without reason is not helpful to anyone.

0606259090|5.0|[[ASIN:0606259090 Fifty Shades Of Grey (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (50 Shades Trilogy)]] This is a story about two loving people who like to get really deep into sex.  The people who don't like it probably have never done anything that approximate sex like Christian and Anastasia have had.  My wife and I read Fifty Shades of Grey just about every night when we are in bed as a lead up to great sex.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This three disc 45th anniversary Blu-ray set, packed with extras, will be a dream ticket for all those who saw the original cinema production and have known the previous DVDs, including the 40th anniversary edition, to fall short of that memory.<br /><br />The songs are, of course, glorious peaks of the American Songbook and the emotional icing on the cake. They follow one after another with utterly memorably melodies combined with equally memorable lyrics - a tremendous example of sustained musical invention at the highest level in this genre. The plot and production of this very popular musical is too well-known to require further comment other than to add that on this new Blu-ray all is revealed with far greater clarity and fullness of colour than previously.<br /><br />The technical restoration of this film is a remarkable achievement with finely restored colour and a well restored soundtrack in DTS-HD master audio surround. This is an enormous improvement over all previous editions and is a remarkable example of the possibilities of modern restoration processes which have triumphantly overcome the considerable problems of film degradation.<br /><br />In my opinion this is a totally successful restoration of a perennial favourite and fully deserving of a 5 star rating. It should give much pleasure to all of those who are wondering if purchasing yet another 'upgrade' is justified. It is!
0307730697|5.0|Let me get all the disclosure stuff out of the way first. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher for review. I also received a free copy from the family, signed by Larry, Janice, Kelly and Shawn Brown, along with the author. I know Larry and Janice personally. Larry and I have ministered in Garland County Detention Center together for several years. The church I pastor sits on what is now called Adam Brown Road, right down the road from Lake Hamilton school where Adam graduated. That may make me a biased reviewer, but without all of those connections, I would still give this book a five star review.<br /><br />I've been obsessed with Navy SEALs and the spec ops community since I was in high school. I read about SEALs before it was cool to read about SEALs. I've read many books concerning these top of the line spec ops men from their involvement in the Vietnam War to their current actions against international terrorists. In light of that, \\"Fearless\\" is one amazing read. It captures all the grueling demands of the SEALs, all of their patriotism and heart, and most of all their outstanding sacrifices. More than mere adrenaline junkies, these men are true warriors, true patriots, true husbands, true fathers and true Americans. In the case of Adam Brown, he was also a true follower of Christ.<br /><br />Let me throw one more disclosure out there. This book is inundated with the Christian faith. Be warned. If seeing the name of Jesus offends you, this book will probably offend you. However, it could not have been written without the numerous mentions of Jesus and the Christian faith because they were so integral to Adam's life. I love what author Eric Blehm says at the conclusion of the book: \\"And though I hadn't opened a Bible in more than twenty-five years, his [Adam's] faith encouraged me to question my own questioning about religion.\\" You see a bio of Adam Brown excluding mention of the Lord Jesus Christ would not be a bio of Adam Brown at all.<br /><br />\\"Fearless\\" is the biography of Navy SEAL Special Operator Adam Brown who gave his life in service to his country on March 17, 2010 on a harrowing mission in the Kunar province of Afghanistan. He was a member of SEAL Team Six, the elite of the elite in the spec ops community. The book focuses on the journey of Adam Brown, which is an amazing, mesmerizing, exciting journey.<br /><br />In the book we see Adam grow up a child who seems to be missing the \\"fear gene\\" and growing into a man that struggles with a dark addiction to crack cocaine. His addiction nearly ruined him, but three things saved him. First and foremost his faith in Jesus Christ saved him. Second, his lovely bride Kelly helped to save him. And finally, his enlistment in the US Navy and advancement to SEAL Team Six saved him.<br /><br />Author Eric Blehm does a fine job narrating the civilian and military aspects of the book. If I could add anything to it, I would put a small dictionary in the back to explain things like MH-47 or AC-130 gunship and other military terms. Having read numerous pieces of military fiction and non-fiction I had no problem with it.<br /><br />In Adam Brown, we find a man who could be a faithful follower of Christ, a compassionate husband and father, and a fierce fighter of international terrorism and be successful at all three. The story in this book will make you laugh, make you cringe, make you cheer and make you cry. It is a difficult read to put down when you start it. It is an encouragement to know that men like Adam are serving our country. He would never have labeled himself a hero, but all those around him considered him that.<br /><br />I noticed that at Family Christian they have a warning about some of the language used in this book. After all, we are dealing with some full throttle soldiers and they can use colorful language occasionally. Do not let that dissuade you from reading this book. The language is extremely tame and I'd give it a PG or PG-13 rating atworst.<br /><br />Readers may approach this book to learn more about the SEALs and specifically SEAL Team Six. They will not walk away disappointed. However, they will also walk away with much more. They will walk away with the story of how a man overcame his personal demons. They will walk away with the story of how a man can be a true husband and father. They will walk away with a picture of loyalty, commitment, determination and faith. They will walk away seeing what a true Christian should look like. As expressed by Adam in a letter he wrote for his children should something happen to him on the battlefield: \\"I'm not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this Earth because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit from me...No matter what, my spirit is given to the Lord and I will finally be victorious.\\"<br /><br />I offer my highest recommendation for \\"Fearless\\" as a pastor, as a husband, as a father, as an American. This book is powerful, and brings a message of hope that we desperately need in our nation today.worst.<br /><br />Readers may approach this book to learn more about the SEALs and specifically SEAL Team Six.

B0086700CM|5.0|My nephews (12 and 2) introduced me to this. It's fun and fast paced. I am enjoying it. probably a little too much.
0756407125|5.0|I downloaded this onto my iPad right after finishing The Name of the Wind....Day One.  I found this as engaging as the first Patrick Rothfuss book......great characters carried on as well as interesting new ones.  Takes some interesting turns & ends up as wonderfully as The Wind.  Bummer that we have to wait til  fall '12 for Day Three.  I will definitely be ordering it too.<br />Great read!!
B007OWG3LM|5.0|I'm a fan of Sigur Ros' more mellow work, the songs that tend to meld into themselves to create a cohesive album vs a \\"song oriented\\" album. With that said, \\"Agaetis..\\" and \\"Med Sud..\\" are my least fav; \\"( )\\" and \\"Valtari\\" are my favs. \\"Takk\\" is a pretty good meld of the two faces of SR, prob 3rd on my list.<br /><br />I love the fact that they didn't simply churn out another album with the usual post-rock conventions, as other reviewers have mentioned; even though they would've done a fine job I'm sure. The whole \\"build-up to a beautiful crescendo that overflows into shimmering bliss\\" is great, but predictable after the genre's been around for 10 years and then some.<br /><br />For \\"Valtari\\" it seems the band went into it with a creative, more experimental idea in mind. There are lots of layered sounds, parts that've been slowed down, etc. It's as if Jonsi brought the idea for he & Alexs' \\"Riceboy Sleeps\\" (dreamy soundscapes) album and SR decided to  do a similar thing, but actively use more studio manipulation to bring the atmosphere closer to the intended emotional response. Usually I can smell the stench of studio tinkering a mile away, and it distracts/detracts from the music; not here in the least, however--the puzzle is complete in all its airy-but-full, \\"small-feel\\" glory. It all creates a floating feeling that isn't jarring to the ears in the least; although many will likely complain that it's nothing more than a sleep aid. I'm also partial to ambient music, so my likings may be explained there.<br /><br />\\"Valtari\\" also really grasps the feelings in some of the sets/stages in the \\"Heima\\" DVD, with more intimacy in the playing than I've heard in any of their other releases. Liked it so much I had to get the double LP.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This fantasy book by Patrick Rothfuss was most engaging.  I had not read fantasy books for some time so was somewhat reluctant to read this when my daughter raved about it.  I'm sorry I waited.  It started a bit slow for my taste, but quickly grabbed me. The characters are well- developed, as are the actions.  It flows very well with little down time.<br /><br />I immediately ordered the next book for my iPad so I could continue on!.  Highly recommended !
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Great app. Nice to connect computers and other devices from off site location. A little challenge with 2. Would recommend to friends
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I originally thought this ruled, until I installed it on my tablet and cannot use the cloud services at all. totally worthless now.

B001609SQA|5.0|This movie is not as good as the first but the end fight scene is definitely awesome. And the movie on the whole is pretty rad.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a great game to play. So many different levels you won't get bored. The price was only. 99 cents and its worth the price.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I bought mine on Amazon more than two years ago and I've used it almost every day since then. I eat a lot of garlic. It is absolutely amazing. It presses garlic neatly and efficiently with very little effort, it cleans up easily with nothing but hot water, and two years later it still looks completely brand new. No chips, scratches, or rust. It is literally indistinguishable from a brand new one.<br /><br />This is the only garlic press I've used that will actually crush unpeeled garlic without a problem, as long as you stop to pull the skin out in between cloves.<br /><br />The price is high but if you eat a lot of garlic it's totally worth it. I cannot recommend this press highly enough.<br /><br />Update 4 years later (2016): I'm still using it every day and it still looks brand new. More impressed than ever.

B000GPI2EK|5.0|Mastodon is a very consistant band, yes their music has evolved, more commercial success, thats not always the worst thing about a band, and it would narrow minded to think a band you like wouldn't want to do different things. Blood Mountain was for me the beginning of more great music to come.

B005F265GQ|1.0|I give it one star for the couple of nods to the series - the gunmen hiding in paintings(\\"Night of the surreal McCoy\\"), and having West fight a metal skinned bad guy(\\"Night of the steel assassin\\")<br />The cinematography was great, as were the costumes and sets - but that's all just window dressing, it can't make up for a bad script, and lazy direction.<br /><br />Barry Sonnenfeld (\\"B.S.\\", as I like call him)is the culprit here, he tried to make W.W.W. into comedy, where the show never was, sure, it had some humorous moments, but it ALWAYS took it's stories seriously, and never winked at the audience. Will Smith might have made a good Jim West, but we'll never know, because he was apparently playing a trigger happy version of the great, great, Grandfather of \\"J\\" from Men in Black instead.  Kevin Kline doesn't fare any better, playing Master of Disguise Artemus Gordon like a fussy Felix Unger of the West, who's favorite disguises always seem to involve him dressing in drag. And kenneth branagh as Dr(\\"Arliss\\" - they couldn't even get his name right!)Loveless is just annoying, Michael Dunn's original Dr. Miguelito Quixote Loveless would have fed this idiotic impostor to his flesh eating house plants, bit by bit, while he was still screaming. Oh, and Selma Hayek is in it too - just more window dressing, she had NOTHING interesting to do in this film!<br /><br />One of the greatest assets of the Original, was the chemistry between West and Gordon, you really felt like they were Brothers in arms, either of whom would gladly lay down his Life to help the other. But in this movie, they basically hate each other, and they never really become friends - the last line of the film has West essentially telling Gordon to shut up. The original duo also had great chemistry with their arch enemy, Dr Loveless, but here, West is only in a couple of scenes with him, and it's just a bunch of AWFUL racist, and handicap quips fired at each other.<br /><br />Well, I guess you know you're introuble, when one of the best parts of your movie is the obligatory Rap song playing over the end credits, and that's pretty much the case with B.S.'s \\"Masterpiece\\". Amazingly, the iconic theme from the original show, was only used for a few seconds in the middle of the film, the opening title music substitutes a blatant imitation of it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was difficult to set it down.  I've purchased the next one and can't wait to get into it as soon as I finish this one.

0307341577|5.0|In the last several days I have read all three of Gillian Flynn's novels and have pretty much the same opinion about all three.  The quality of the writing is superb, the characters are complicated, to say the least, and the plotting is absorbing and original.  However, each one of the books is somewhat lessened by the convoluted, unbelievable ending. I don't wish to rehash the plots or give away the endings, but I am curious to see if anyone else agrees with me about this. The author is truly talented and her books are very hard to put down, but I do feel she needs to work on her solutions to the mysteries and make them seem more credible.
0099579936|2.0|I'm a positive person so let's try to construct this book in a way that isn't so immaculately degrading.  I've graduated from USC emphasis in English Literature and currently a writer and this novel.. well.. it is POORLY constructed.  The words the author uses in the sex scenes lack wit and creativity.  Though it is considered to be a BDSM book, towards the end it comes across as psychologically disturbing, rather than stimulating.  At the conclusion of the novel, the leading lady is hit by the man with a belt many times as she bawls out tears of pain, not pleasure.. a man jacking off to the thoughts of domestic violence. WEAK WRITING.  POOR CONSTRUCTION. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE.  Any takers?  Read it!  You'll love it! :)
B006OGMEUI|3.0|Folk metal is a fascinating genre. Bands from all over take inspiration from their homelands and infuse it into their music. When combined with the exotic instrumentation of folk metal, this usually makes for a unique listen. Eluveitie, however, are pretty much \\"the\\" folk metal band these days. They're far beyond the popularity of most other folk bands, and as such, they're the band that sparked my odyssey into that fascinating genre.<br /><br />With that said, it is always depressing when a band that is responsible for expanding one's musical horizons seems to be inevitably descending in quality. Such is the case with Eluveitie's recent effort, Helvetios.<br /><br />Eluveitie, at its core, has always been generic melodic death metal. No powerful, bone-chilling riffs like Insomnium or Skyfire, and no atmospheric keyboards like Dark Tranqullity. They never needed it though, as that's what the folk instruments were for - the hurdy gurdy, flute, all of it; they added the slick melodies and atmosphere that was lacking. Helvetios is the first album where those folk instruments don't seem to be enough. It's the first album where it seems obvious that the music is lacking something, though, however good their music might've been before, I personally always thought that some Insomnium-esque riffs or Dark Tranquillity style keyboards would've made it that much better. Even so, I think that, ultimately, the problem with this album is that everything has the \\"been there and heard that\\" feeling. It's the same damn thing they've been doing with practically no deviation or differences to distinguish this album from anything else in their discography; only, this time, they're doing it worse than usual. Furthermore, the songs seem to run together, leaving me wondering which song is which. Most of the songs are all the same - same tempo, same folk sounds, and never any real technically to set any of it apart.<br /><br />Now, that isn't to say the album is bad. There's 17 tracks andnone of them annoy me or make me want to skip them. That alone makes this a good album. Furthermore, even if all the melodeath elements are even more trite, the melodies of the folk instruments, though they sometimes seem rather contrived, are generally still cool and well composed (just not as well composed as on previous albums). There's highlights, such as \\"Luxtos\\" and \\"Santonian Shores,\\" which have slick and sweet folk melodies and super catchy choruses. \\"A Rose for Epona\\" is also fairly different, in that it's more of a poppy folk rock song fully sung by their female vocalist, Anna Murphy; it's not really heavy at all, but I like it.<br /><br />I think one of the biggest highlights, though is \\"Alesia.\\" It opens with a beautiful melody and more clean singing, proceeding into a more slick folk melodies, a cool guitar groove, and a fun duet of clean singing and growls. It's all good stuff, but its the ending that really gets me:<br />Oudside Alesia<br />We offered a living sacrifice<br />Outside the doors of Alesia<br />Where our tears run dry<br />This is sung by a child-like choir; it's really atmospheric and leaves me with goosebumps. \\"Tullianum\\" directly follows; another atmospheric and short segment, mostly vocal driven with a simple melody, it would've done just fine as end of \\"Alesia,\\" and I do believe the two should be listened to together at all times.<br /><br />I guess the best part of the album is the lyrics. While Eluveitie have always had fascinating lyrics about the Gauls and whatnot, this album is a full blown concept focusing on the Gallic Wars. This is what turns the album into a real journey; even if the music feels generic and uninspired at times, there's undoubtedly a certain flow to the music that the conceptual lyrics portray. They deserve props for that, if nothing else. This odyssey of sorts has a \\"Proloque\\" and \\"Epilogue\\" - and \\"Epilogue\\" is, surprisingly, one of my favorites of the album. The narration is haunting but convincing, givingme a sense of pride for the ancient Helvetii that is the album's perspective. The flute that dominates after the narration is passionate, and the entire track is atmospheric yet again. It simply establishes a breathtaking emotion that most of the album lacks.<br /><br />Nonetheless, despite the good this album has going for it, and despite how much I really want to love this album, I simply can't help but get the feeling that the majority of it is not only too similar for me to opt listening to this ahead of, for example, Everything Remains (As It Never Was) (my personal favorite of their discography, and an album that has gotten an unfair amount of criticism from its fans), but also too similar within itself, with little diversity to separate most of the tracks. Maybe it will one day click with me the way it has others, and I'll suddenly understand how this is such an improvement. Until then, though, this stands as a disappointment.
1451626657|5.0|Although as i was reading it, i was thinking \\"WTF\\", nothing makes sense, whats the point, whats going on... but i didn't quit and read it to the last... and i am glad i did so, at the end everything becomes clear and you start connecting all the things that went on and voila its a masterpiece, one of my most favorite books that i am definitely going to read again.
0307951529|4.0|When I first picked this book up, I thought it would be about how to start a small business on little or no money. That was not the case, and in fact, I wasn't sure I would even finish the entire book. But it turned out to be much more.<br /><br />The $100 Start Up is really an inspiring guide to stepping out on your own, doing what you love, without fear, (your own, or)of what others might say. (You know who I'm talking about, the nay-sayers).<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author interviews various entrepreneurs in different sectors of businesses. He asks many questions; and business owners are more than happy to share their personal stories.<br /><br />What kind of threw me back, was the fact that the author talks about creating a business where one can \\"give back\\", to which I thought, \\"how does this apply in my business, as a jewelry designer?\\" But with further reading and exploration, I understood more.<br /><br />The author stresses excellent points, such as:giving the customer what they want, connecting with others, and maybe even showing potential customers that you do have what they want!<br /><br />There are so many helpful insights in this book, that I won't give away here, and encourage anyone who wants to work for themselves, be creative, and be happy to pick this book up and give it a thorough read.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|Ok I'll keep this as short as possible. This album is better than there last. But not something you must run out and buy. As one of my friends put it, the album starts off great and falls off towards the end. And its short, 36:59 short. More songs then filler this time unlike there last album which was full of filler and not worth the money. Why would any band list filler as a song on the track list is beyond me.<br /><br />Castle of Glass,I'll Be Gone,Burn It Down,In My Remains really stand out from the others on this album. Download them from Amazon or I Tunes and save some money. Yes I bought this album for $10 at Hot Topic, but had I knew it was so short, I'd just downloaded the songs worth a listen and saved a few bucks.
0784010188|5.0|This morning for the first time in a long time I watched the first Terminator. I enjoyed it a lot. I even rated it my fav out of the first and second movie. Well Hubby and I just finished watching Terminator Judgment Day and I change my vote. This is my fav out of the two. I know this is bad, but I totally rout for the bad guy. He was so cool. The way he changed into people, the way he ran, the way he melted and then came back. I think he was really cool. I rate this movie number one. I'll be watch the next two Terminator movies in the next couple of days. I'm looking forward to it because I've never seen them before.

B00009RAJJ|5.0|After Rumors, everyone wondered how Fleetwood Mac would follow that up. When Tusk showed up, millions were happy, but it did not have the adoration that Rumors had. I was one of them. Reviews compared this album to The Beatles White Album, a comparison that left me baffled. Other than the 2 being double albums, I didn't think they had anything else in common. I listen to it now and I realize it's better than Rumors. The songs are fine. Lindsey Buckingham went to town and produced a masterpiece. Lush, rich recordings, yet tastefully done. The new Remastering I think sounds better than the album. The 2nd disc offers a look at the songs in mid stage, and you can hear how Buckingham formed his production ideas. Brilliant. This is a great album.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|I had not even heard of this \\"romance\\" before the preview and then later watching this film. I was intrigued by the going back and forth between a modern day girl's struggle lacking love in her own relationship and this Duchess Wallis Simpson who lacked security in being with King Edward. Like \\"The Iron Lady\\" this story has opened doors to my wanting to learn more about the time period 1920s-1970s from the perspective of the people surrounding this event (i.e. the people of England).<br /><br />I was also impressed by Madonna's undertaking of such a project.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books in one week. Let's just say that in one of the books, I purchased Roberta Flacks \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" - don't want to spoil it for you, but if you purchase the books based on my review, please post and agree. Enjoy as I did.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I've seen the Beach Boys many times in concert. They never disappoint!!!! I've been anxiously waiting for some new music for years now. I bought this cd never hearing anyone's opinion or without reading a review. The boys haven't sounded any better at anytime in 50 years. Every Beach Boys fan has to add this cd to your already numerous collection!! I couldn't be more thrilled that Brian is back with the group. I'm also thrilled that I purchased this cd from Amazon. I really got a super daal ( PRICE )!!! After buying from Amazon, I noticed that the price in stores was higher, which made me REAL happy!!!
B007KUFDBY|4.0|Leave it to Disney to come up with a way to update Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale \\"Treasure Island\\" into a science fiction epic. The studio that brought you the unforgettable live-action film version returned to the source material once again with the idea of taking the adventure into deep space and to other worlds. Unfortunately, moviegoers weren't interested in \\"Treasure Planet\\" when it came out in 2002. The film underperformed at the box office but was still nominated for a 2002 Academy Award in the category of Best Animated Feature.<br /><br />Thanks to every movie on the planet receiving the high definition treatment, audiences get the chance to give this entertaining film another chance with the release of \\"Treasure Planet: 10th Anniversary Edition.\\" It's hard to believe the movie came out 10 years ago. It was the first to be released in IMAX and regular theaters on the same day. The movie is also of importance as a shining example of 2D hand drawn art used on top of 3D computer animation.<br /><br />Not much changes in \\"Treasure Planet\\" as far as story and characters go. It still revolves around Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who discovers a holographic treasure map that supposedly leads to a pirate's loot on a far-off planet. Hawkins and his mentor Dr. Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) embark on a trek across the stars on a ship whose crew is made up of dangerous aliens led by a mutineering cyborg named Long John Silver (Brian Murray). Can Jim and the rest of the loyal crew of the ship find the treasure and collect it before the traitorous buccaneers do?<br /><br />This will relate to fans of sci-fi both young and old. It takes the great classic tale and successfully makes it relevant to kids in the 21st century used to watching \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Star Trek,\\" and other movies and TV shows that take them to other worlds. The pacing of the film is good and the story will keep the viewer's attention.<br /><br />The high definition transfer of the film is magnificent. The picture is crystal clear and filled with bright and vivid colors that keep your eyes glued to the screen. The 5.1 surround further brings to life James Newton Howard's musical score and the anthemic pop songs of Goo Goo Dolls' John Rzeznik. The explosions, laser shots, and flying ships will jump out at you from all over your home entertainment center with this great audio mix.<br /><br />Special features for the film include 43-minutes of production featurettes introduced by actor Laurie Metcalf and a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" one entitled \\"Disney's Animation Magic.\\" There's also comprehensive feature commentary with co-directors/co-writers Ron Clements and John Musker, producer Roy Conli, and supervising animators John Ripa, Ian Gooding, and Glen Keane.

This movie brings you up to the point of what Batman has endured and still endures to save Gotham City, enjoy it for yourselfs.<br /><br />  Kat!

0307719774|5.0|I love this book.  It really helps for those who find journaling a chore.  I love writing a sentence or two a day.  I'm excited to see how my responses change throughout the next five years.
0439023513|5.0|Suzanne Collins' \\"Mockingjay\\" is the last of the Hunger Games Series.  I liked it!  In Book 1, we got to know the main characters and fully understand the horror of the 'Games' that made the district children fight to the death each year.  Book 2 puts Katniss and Peeta, along with other past victors back in the arena to again fight to their death in the Quarter Quell, then the rebellion is sparked, giving \\"Catching Fire\\" more of a thriller feel with a faster pace.<br /><br />\\"Mockingjay\\" shows raw warfare as District 13 and their rebel allies battle the Capitol, with nothing, including innocent human lives, standing in the way of victory for either side.  The book has more of an 'action movie' feel, with visual details that make the story unfold in the mind's eye. Katniss and Peeta are shell shocked by all they've been through, but things only get rougher for them.  Peeta wages an internal battle to reverse the Capitol's mindwashing, Katniss must lead the rebellion and strike a deal with President Coin, and all hell is going to break loose when they go into battle.<br /><br />The ending ties up all the loose ends and manages to find a positive note out of all the misery the characters have gone through.  This gritty series is well worth the read.
B007G8SET8|5.0|One of the all time veterans of NWOBHM,they have lasted this long only to release another live dvd. The song selection is superb here with classics mixed in with current songs! This dvd/cd combo is worth the price,one of the best performances bar none!Excellent buy for any metal fan!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Rick Riordan is my absolute favorite author. I have read all of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books and couldn't put any of them down. But I have to say that this is definitely his best book yet. It was absolutely amazing!!! I highly reccomend this book to all Percy Jackson fans!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book  The characters were poorly developed and lacked depth.  I made the mistake of only reading the positive reviews.  this book was shallow and unconvincing
B000JQUZCI|5.0|On writing this review, I had to remind myself this novel is 200 hundred years old and likely the first of its kind, and therefore as original as a novel can ever be. Today's horror writers would not get away with the long narratives, wordy dialogue and second (and third) accounts told through various people.<br /><br />But none of this really mattered. The rich and dense writing style did not get in the way of the story, which drew me in from the first. Poor Frankenstein is doomed the moment he creates the monster and immediately regrets doing so. I had to smile to myself when Frankenstein returns to see the monster gone. 'Thank heavens,' he thinks, 'my troubles are over!' As if! The monster denied a companion or of humanity returns to pick off Frankenstein's loved ones. I felt sorry for the monster that bore no resemblance to the Hollywoodized clich&eacute; we imagine. A creepy and dark tale; horror fans who omit this book from their reading list are missing out.

0786553804|1.0|I was very turned off that the woman walked out on her marriage. Maybe if she had tried to \\"find herself\\" spiritually before she considered leaving her husband, I would have been more sympathetic. Basically, it looked like she traveled around the world, ate a lot of food, vegetated in India and then shacked up with a Himbo guy. Notice that relationship doesn't last, either. She doesn't seem to have learned much about commitment! Maybe she's taking her cues from Hollywood.<br /><br />Really don't see the appeal of this book and have no interest in watching the movie.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|The little stage that could hold the biggest of giants! That is what you could get & the Checkerboard Lounge. I was born & raised in Chicago & have been to most of the clubs in the area. What a show this is people! This is a piece of history you hold in your hands if you have bought this. This is Southside Chicago 423 E. 43d Street to be exact that Buddy Guy owned & now owns Buddy Guys Legends at 700 South Wabash Avenue.On this stage on this night on this dvd & cd you have nothing but legends like Muddy Waters, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, Ian Stewart, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells & Chicago legend John Primer who still plays often at Legends who i have met & hung out with some at a few places. This is a awesome dvd/cd set! The picture is better then i thought it would be too But the sound of the recording is amazing. Very loud upfront clear recording. Every song on this set is killer Muddy Waters. I am so glad they tapped this show i just wish this came out 30 years ago. But at least they did it right & have done a great job on the mastering. What can be better then the man who came up with the line Like A Rolling Stone to play with the Rolling Stones in a small club on the southside of chicago not far from where chess records first recorded Muddy Waters & then still get Buddy Guy & Junior wells on stage too. This is the best of the best playing low down sweet home chicago style blues. just listening to blues music is not the same feeling as going to the Southside Of Chicago & going to one of these blues clubs but this cd & dvd set makes me feel like i'm right there & i can smell the home cooked food & spilled beer. This just may be the greatest blues album to ever exist to man. Long Live Chicago Blues Baby!
0920236251|1.0|This book was an all around disappointment. What a surprise I got when I received a small little book of 3 1/2\\" X 3 1/2\\". I know the cost was low, but come on, it was more than $3 plus shipping! I went back and checked the product page to see if it mentioned the size. It did in the notes which were very small and down below under the product information. I just never look at product information for a book. I feel it should have been by the title. The story was also not well done. It had a very weak ending. The illustrations were okay, not great.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is super fun! the only problem. with the kindle edition is that the game keeps on glitching during the game. I recommend. this game to anyone who enjoys games that test your reactions but to people who can also deal with glitchy games.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|Stories were ultimately very hard to believe.  Most chapters were poorly written, redundant, contradictory, and/or just plain stupid.  Was really hard to take this book seriously.
B0000027D5|4.0|Ok, I'll bite. Never have put in a review for a Santana release, so I shall give you a little one now. For the longest time, the only Santana release I had ever owned was Moonflower (really, really sick album which would probably lead you all to wonder why I had not bothered to get any other Santana releases). However, since last summer I have made up for lost time and sort of had a Santana \\"epiphany\\" collecting the first seven or eight Santana releases including Lotus.<br /><br />Lotus is an incredible two-disc live slice of where the Santana band was at musically and spirtually in the early 70's. Mix up early Santana band latin-jam feel along with the more jazz-fusion oriented stuff from Caravanserai and Welcome and voila: you have Lotus.<br /><br />From the soaring cacaphony that is \\"Every Step of the Way\\" to the beautiful \\"Samba Pa Ti\\", Lotus includes a little smattering of everything. (Of course, the obligatory 80 hour seventies drum solo, \\"Kyoto\\" is included, but skip it if you aren't interested! Just give Mike Shrieve his props!) What really stands out to me on these two discs is \\"Incident at Neshabur\\". If this version doesn't melt your face off, you must have really overdosed on the Pottery Barn soundtrack. Sick. Sick. Sick. As you listen, pick out Santana's song quotes in the middle including \\"Afro Blue\\", \\"My Favorite Things\\", and \\"Fool on the Hill\\". This track will make you turn up the volume and rip off the knob for sure.<br /><br />The only drawbacks to this album are the abbreviated versions of \\"Stone Flower\\", \\"Samba de Sausalito\\", and \\"Batuka\\". They are played almost as little tantalizing teases leaving you wanting more. Upon hearing the album versions of these tunes, I had really wanted to hear these live. Also, the sparse vocals on the album leave a lot to be desired. Maybe they need to be a little more high in the mix, I don't know. All I know is that they sound pretty bad when you need them the most, ie. \\"Toussaint L'ouverture\\".<br /><br />Don't let the little blemishes above scare you off. No fair. Just go give this obscure 70's live album a listen. You will not be disappointed. Last word: Incident at Neshabur! (orig. post: 5/2/11)
B001437DMA|2.0|Wow. I'm a longtime Satch fan and own just about everything he has put out (only because just about every release of his is stellar) I own. I've given Professor Satchafunkilus several listens now and I must say he has put out his worst album since Engines of Creation. This is a real snoozer of an album. Other than \\"Musterion\\", \\"Overdriver\\", \\"Revelation\\", and \\"Come On Baby\\" nothing really sticks out here. Some of the trademark Satch is here but it really does not help the album. Really disappointed in the last two tracks which are sure cures for insomnia; ie. \\"Andalusia\\"- excellent song title. Bad song. Z.Z. Satriani apparently is credited with playing the sax on a track or two, but I must be deaf because I cannot pick him out at all.<br />I can't say I'm disappointed, because not every album can be a winner, but Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock is what it is - a giant step down from Super Colossal and an average Satch release at best. (orig. post: 4/12/08)
B003S897U0|4.0|So The Black Crowes are taking a long hiatus again, huh? Well after 20 years, if this is it, then color me impressed. Great live band. Excellent songs. That's all you need to know. With the release of Croweology, the Crowes have capped off an amazing 20 years. This double disc album gives mostly acoustic renditions of previously released album tracks, save for \\"Cold Boy Smile\\" and \\"She\\" (which I first heard live in Jim Thorpe, PA last year). This release really hits the mark and is beautifully done. Really dig the Jethro Tull Stand-Up-esque gatefold with the diorama. Can you find all the Crowes albums in the forest clearing scene? Ahhhh - what guilty fun! Anyway, the music is the stand-out here. The first six albums are represented. From the barrelhouse piano blues of \\"Jealous Again\\" to the gospel freak-out from \\"My Morning Song\\", they basically cover all the bases, while hitting us a with a few updated versions along the way. Check out the reworked \\"Let me Share the Ride\\" - that is still my favorite track so far from both discs! Also, the interesting spaciness at the end of \\"Non-Fiction\\" somehow really works. Good stuff. Only one disappointment for me however: One track from Lions?! This very underrated album could easily have had three or four songs represented here. What they should have done is omitted \\"Welcome to the Goodtimes\\" (from the mediocre 1998 effort By Your Side) and added \\"Ozone Mama\\" or \\"Cypress Tree\\". But then, this is a very minor irritation compared to how good this album is. So Crowes fans, dig in and enjoy. You won't be disappointed. (orig. post: 8/9/10)
0060936223|3.0|I realized this was a fairy tale when I read this of Patti's husband, Fred Smith: \\"He was a king among men and men knew him.\\" That's such a weird, Biblical-sounding thing to say of one's husband, plus I knew from Gillian McCain & Legs McNeil's PLEASE KILL ME that Fred had an alcohol problem. But what really disappointed me was that Smith so swiftly glossed over the decision to leave the life of art she'd built in New York with Robert. That's what the whole book is about! And in one line, she ditches it, all of it, for a king of men.<br /><br />That's when I saw that this is not a true story. It's a bedtime story. I love Patti Smith, and I still really enjoyed the book, but why must she hold back so much from us? Must it all be rainbows and butterflies? I was especially bothered by the scanty descriptions of Patti's sexual feelings (oh gosh, she'd never really thought about sadomasochism outside of the covers of Genet). I'd guess that being in love with a gay SM hustler is complicated, if not painful; it might even be exciting. Yet she describes it as laughter and affection, then lights outs on the life she's built with Robert for a man who was \\"a king of men and men knew him.\\" If I was an interpreter of the unconscious, I might point out the references to domination and homosexuality in this description of her husband (it's all she gives us--we might as well analyze it), but I'll be polite and just say this: I don't buy it. I sense that something has been painted out of this book.<br /><br />I wanted Smith to say more about why she left music and New York to be a wife and mother. It truly is the ending of this particular story, the story of her life as a young artist. I'm not sure if she's doing an Andy Warhol here and creating her own image before someone else does or what, but I believe that wisdom is linked to truth I don't trust this particular gap in the story.<br /><br />After all, this is PATTI SMITH! We know her work. She's drawn to the underworld, the criminal, and the boundaries between things; we see it in her male identification (the clothes, her tomboy past, her haircut based on Keith Richards, her idol Bob Dylan), her love of Genet and Burroughs (gay and rough sex), the serrated aesthetic of punk rock. Hers is a palatte that contains a lot darkness, conflict, sex, drugs, and violence. This is the world she choose; this is the world she helped create. To treat these conflicts so blithly, she has to be either stupid or disingenuous; I'm going with disingenuous.

B004EPZ07U|4.0|Got this for a nice price of 9.99 but had to wait for a few days prior to shipment as mentioned during purchase. That is okay since I waited for the right time to get one. This version had the theatrical and extended version. Personally I preferred the extended version which I was wondering why it was not shown in the theaters since the character development was much better.<br />The BD and DVD are nice.<br /><br />However, if you prefer a digital copy and you are always out of the USA area. Then the UV copy is something you should not consider to get. You can access it within USA but when you go out, so long viewing it from anywhere else.<br />Personally I prefer an iTunes Digital copy which you redeem you get downloaded and no worries where ever you are.<br /><br />Which I kept wondering why in the world do this movie companies make their own way of letting get content. We paid for it and we should get it anyWHERE, anytime, anyplace.<br /><br />So my rating.<br />4 for the movie/combe<br />1 for the digital copy
B00881VLCE|2.0|Not enough puzzles to keep a small childs mind stimulated long enough. I have a 7 year old who did all the puzzles in 2 days.
0307592731|5.0|Got this book from the library because I've day hiked the PCT & lost my mother at a young age so I thought I would relate. I was right. Loved it so much that after reading it in just a few days because I could not put it down, I am here to buy a copy for myself & another for my sister.<br /><br />Cheryl tells her tale with raw honesty & emotion, humor & poetry. Her openess about her sex life is refreshing. While not my style, I say to each their own. Even the great Maya Angelou speaks about her days as a prostitute in her autobiography. I applaude her bravery in speaking of her drug use as well. Many people have addictions, it is whether we can rise above them that counts. Cheryl went on to have a happy, healthy family, so kudos to her.<br /><br />Thank you Cheryl for echoing so many of the emotions I have felt regarding the loss of my mother to Cancer when she was only 30. A hole in my heart is an understatement. I am glad you healed. Brava on putting your journey so poetically on paper! I am about to read Torch next.
1597801585|3.0|I believe I am above average intelligence, but I found this to be a difficult read. Much was not explained, and I found the story line hard to follow.
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been addicted to this game for weeks. I love it. I just wish that there were more achievements for each character.
B007P3TMW2|4.0|I found this to be well-directed and acted, but melancholy to an extreme most of the way. Reliving 911 via movies is difficult even now. It's hard to get through this without a tear or two. If you are in the mood for a tough emotional journey with young Oscar and his mother through the first year and a half after Tom Hanks, the dad and husband, dies in one of the towers, this will fill that need. I was impressed with child actor Tom Horn, whose role featured a roller coaster of moods. Max von Sydow and Sandra Bullock also handled their parts well. Hanks was, well, Hanks, and for my taste, he's always good. Don't think it's a good choice for a romantic evening with a new date, however.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this app only prob is that it sometimes freezes and that can be a real bummer but all In all if I could go back in time I would buy again
B005LAIHIQ|5.0|Other people have gone into great detail about the film and what to expect so I'll be brief. It a wonderfully executed piece that doesn't take itself too seriously. As a DARK comedy it's right on target. I also feel the script did the best it could what with the original soap opera line up. It was a huge cast of characters and there is only so much time you can devote to each. I personally would enjoy a sequel so that more character depth could be added. As it is I think you got a good sample of Collinsport in a two hour package. Also the humor with the way Barnabas reacts to the modern world is definitely needed. I always found it odd in the original series that Barnabas just went about the modern day Collinsport as though he had never been gone.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This book is poorly written and boring.  I felt I had to get it because the first book left me hanging.  I couldn't even finish it!  I don't even know how they even made it into a series, when it couldve been one of those smutty stories for an \\"adult\\" magazine.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I like some crappy books (cough twilight cough) but this one takes the cake! I could not even finish it, I knew it was \\"erotic\\" but if you're going to up sell THAT part then at least make the sex scenes believable ffs!
B000HF0KXU|3.0|The movie is about hostages and terrorism and money. I liked the way John Travolta acts so cool and aloof. He seems like he is invincible. I don't want to be like him but he acts very controlled and in charge. I like Halle, she is also cool and pretty in the movie. It talks about how people can buy into illusions and that is for sure. The technology is something I would like to understand. Breaking codes, understanding the language. It is like a puzzle. I suspect the more you understood, the more creativeness could open up for you, like a door to another world. I think that would be fun to manifest. Its like when you can draw well, that whole world can be opened up. All the gifts that so many of us fail to see and take advantage of, if we would pay attention or feel happy enough to move towards it.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|It took me about 15 minutes to get it to work the first time but after that it was great! My wife has a bunch of 80's tapes of her daughter singing opera that she wanted converted to CD for her birthday. The tapes were not in that great of shape but they sound fine after the conversion. I am really pleased. It was going to cost $157 plus shipping to send them away to be converted. This product was worth every penny.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|That was the word that comes to mind. Whitney is singer actor and Kevin is a bodyguard for her. The romance is hard to evolve, he is closed and she is playful, they are different. I liked when her and her sister sing together. They seemed together and connected by beautiful angel voices. The sabers I will put down, I saw many on one of my sojourns. The cabin with the snowfilled forest and mystical lake. The steam coming up from the walk at Whitneys mansion and statue lined drive, to jog and run in that steamy foresty town. The voice and the energy she emits, it is so viable so alive, It is extremely hard for me to think she used, too much flowing energy coming from her being. Her confidence and her poise. The family moments at the cabin, cooking, playing chess, holding each other, boating on a placid glass of water. Taking a hit for living in the moment, a moment filled with desire to really live your job. To help another, to be that kind and good. To be quiet and stoic without letting anybody know your insides that are filled with such beauty. Kevin's character has some of this.

B001UV4XHY|1.0|Ok, i find it stupid and asinine that they only release this product for BR (bleu-raes) and DVD (direct video demand), but NOT for VHS (video home system)!!!!!!!!! year after year i see less and less films available for VHS! this sucks! my collection is completely ruined if i conform and start buying BR or DVDs--the cases are too skinny and look RETARDED next to my good old VHS discs! PLEASE release this one on VHS! i just LOVE Hairy Potter and want it soo bad on home media!

B000QRIGLC|1.0|This story might be about a real navy SEAL but I doubt one wrote it.  The SEALs I know are smart, quiet, contemplative men.  This book, on rhe other hand, is full of right wing blather and hyperbole. I suspect the true author was working from notes and an atlas and trying to cash in the popularity of SEALs. If there is a real navy SEAL somewhere in the chain of authorship, I hope he made some money.  But I doubt it.
034580404X|4.0|Books were great (over 1500 pages)!  They arrived a few days after the \\"expected\\" delivery date.  Package arrived in great condition.  I could only find the paperback books on Amazon so the book casing hasn't held up very well.  With that being said, all three books were less than $30, so still a great buy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Is this a good read? YES<br />Am I glad I bought it and read it? YES<br />The creator of this has diligently worked to provide a glimpse of a reality that differs from the norm and this she has done with taste and affection.  As such I can not complain about her book, Hell I would not even want to!<br />Personally I think she might have taken it a bit further and with even greater intensity, hence the vanilla reference in the title.  Yes she has addressed the vanilla well in her book.  I take my own offerings further but in a fantasy setting.  I'd love to see this author move into a fantasy erotica setting and see her address not Master/submissive relationships but Master/slave situations.
B002VWNID6|1.0|The DVD case claims the DVD is dual layer format but I still had to flip the DVD to see the rest of the movie. No warning on screen to flip the DVD, nothing. It took me awhile to figure out I had to flip the disk over when the picture suddenly ended. Warner Brothers should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such a poor quality product, let alone misrepresenting it. Do not buy this piece of junk!
B002JC9RMY|2.0|I really wanted to like this, despite all the bad reviews.  But yeah if you're a fan of DB, DBZ etc... you will feel this really misses the mark.  for those not familiar they will get lost and lose interest.  I give it 2 stars out of respect for the source material and passable special effects.  everything else from casting, acting to story is a miss.  don't know if it's the worst movie ever but it's definitely in the conversation.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I just couldn't put it down!  This raunchy realistic book was just mind blowing at times and kept me spellbound.  I have started reading the sequel and again I can't put that down either!  All I can say is WOW!

1466401885|5.0|I was looking for another good love story book after reading Fifty Shades of Grey and Bared to you and this one compared to the love story in those books. I loved the characters in the story and the way the book read. You could really relate to some of the characters. I definitely recommend this one looking if you are looking for a good love story.

0743497465|2.0|It was obvious to me about a quarter of the way in that Dan Brown did not give this novel his best.  He seems to have tossed a bunch of standardized techno-thriller characters in his hat and then assigned them to the good-guy and bad-guy columns blindly.  When he assigned a fistful of VERY minor space transportation start-ups the role of Evil Monied Corporate Oppressors I seriously wondered if he had done any background research at all.  (Exercise for the Discerning Reader: how many of them even survive today, let alone have the resources to ... well, you will know when you finish;)<br /><br />I made up my mind when he had something one of the characters needed not be available because certain government employees were on one of their frequent strikes.  Anyone who knows ANYTHING about Washington since the Reagan years would be in full ROTFL mode with that one!  Brown HAD to have his tongue firmly planted in cheek!<br /><br />Put a copy in your beach bag, but not on your Classic Literature shelf.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|read this book on my kindle when i could, listened at my part time job when i couldnt read. it took me maybe a few days. recommend it to everyone!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was well worth it I really like the fact that it actually gives u all the games and its a great challenge
B008I43DYU|5.0|The calculator app I had previously didn't look that great on my Kindle Fire.  Calculator Pro looks fantastic.  Does what it's suppose to and includes 3 themes.  The paper one is neat but I went with the default.  If you're in the market for a calculator for your KF then look no further.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love how Evernote is accessible from my phone, kindle, computer, whatever. I also like the fact that it has so many convenient functions and other products that make using Evernote even more enclusive.

B008GXHOFW|5.0|the amazing spider-man is the best game I've ever played. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves spider-man and anyone who loves kindle games.<br />BUT!!!, the price could be a little lower. $6.99 is a little high for this game.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I never thought there would be a set of terrible books as popular as Twilight. Looks like I was wrong. These in fact are worse. E.L. James makes fanfiction writers look like delusional virgins that are in bad need of a thesaurus thrown at their heads. For the love of all that is good in this world do not buy this drivel. Don't give this \\"writer\\" (and I use that term loosely) any of your money. Instead go buy a ball-peen hammer and bash it against your temples. Trust me, it will have the same effect on your brain.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am so mad at myself for falling for the trap of purchasing this book (Kindle version... but still). Horribly written. Horrible characters. Is there any more of an annoying, ridiculous, unrealistic, controlling, repulsive character as Christian Grey? Don't. Just don't buy this book. Really. Don't waste your money and don't encourage this fiasco of a series.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this. Breaking Bad is habit forming. Action packed, suspenseful and always leaves you wanting more.

1609611543|5.0|After reading this book I immediately cut out all bread. That was 8 days ago and I feel so much better! Not bloated and heavy feeling and my stomach feels lighter and thinner.<br />I have been a vegetarian for 41 years and never do drink juices or sodas. So, that part of the diet is not a problem for me. What is a challenge is the bread and my tortilla chips and fave crackers.<br />You do realize how much bread and wheat products fill you up and are a big percentage of your diet.<br /><br />I recently changed my diet to never eat items with High Fructose Corn Syrup. Amazing how many products contain that poison.<br /><br />The book is very good and well written with lots of information and you will definitely get an education!<br />Well worth reading and adding this to your library. I also like following his Wheat Belly Blog.<br />There has to be \\"something \\" to this theory if almost 400 people are reviewing and following his advice. I am.
B007N31ZBU|5.0|This is the quintessential must see movie. Its entertaining, innovative and instrumental to modern filmmaking. Its no wonder this movie took seven academy awards including best picture in 1973. Its charm and magic has never stopped, and llike fine wine it only gets better with time. There is no clear explanation for how it works, it just does. To its credit was a perfect combination of talented artist and a snappy toe tapping melody of the period. Since its introduction there have been several imitation, but nothing has ever compared to the original. It is a genuine piece of American film making. And no matter who you are, without a doubt your sure to enjoy The Sting.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Better then described, works everywhere! Fast, simple, and looks as great as the actual pc monitor. On screen keyboard and mouse work seamlessly.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app. I use it to download a lot of music. This app is great for downloading a lot of videos and music. I would definitely recommend this app to everyone I know.
B000EQHV48|3.0|One thing this set has going for it is splendid audio engineering.  It is just right, to my ears.  A perspective which is close enough to convey all of the audio detail, but not so close that you feel like someone shoved your head in the piano and shut the lid.<br /><br />Pommier brings a certain French wit and style to these performances, which I found rather effective in the early sonatas but less so in the late sonatas.  The late sonatas struck me as played too \\"straight\\" without the little expressive touches that can make a performance truly memorable.<br /><br />I gave the release three stars, mainly because I personally regard the late sonatas as the most important part of Beethoven's output.  If I were rating the sonatas individually, I would probably give 4 or even 5 stars to performances of many of the early sonatas.

B00000ILDE|5.0|Wanting to see this extended version for so Many years. I remember seeing the version when I was a child on tv. And eveytime I saw aliens after that grown up, I could have sworn there were pieces missing. I could never find it at the video store. However I finally found it. It the DVD came perfectly and it didn't take long to get here.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I love the part when Ana meets Patrick Bateman! Then I woke up, realizing it was all just a wonderful dream.  Ana was still alive and 50 Shades of Horrible was still there next to my bed, only a few chapters old, and I was depressed.  After reading other reviews it's obvious Ana remains alive and complaining through the entire trilogy so, while I do have some literary stamina, I would rather bang myself in the head repeatedly with a hammer before finishing this book.<br /><br />Interesting side note though, apparently some women who read this become insatiable, which I suppose is a good thing for men of the world.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very awesome game. Like how you control everything and make it how you want. Very unique game and would consider it to anybody.
B000SGRONM|2.0|This is the first book I haven't like as much as the others ...but his elf experience at Macy's is worth the price of admission.  Love his work my favorite is Me Talk Pretty.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|Three major defects to the movie. The sound was not properly recorded to the movie. Going twenty to thirty levels per scene and a lot of the sound was muffled and distorted. Which I think was an affect, but! Second, the film is really NOT film noire and the use of black and shadows did NOT enhance anything. In fact I would term parts of the movie as being designed for the blind. Third and importantly, the movie has sexual perversions which do NOT really help the film. Personally, I think the film deserves a black listings along with the actors and crew. De Sade lives on in this jerk flick. Stripping the defects the script and camera work really was super-sub parr! Thanks, Harry.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|Ira Levine's classic \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" is as good a read as it was fifty years ago.  He wrote believable characters,put them in a plausible plot and revved up the tension from page one.  It does a writer good to go back and read what has come before. Highly recommend.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very good app,  for doing the the dills, my next step is to take it shopping with me.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been using tablets and PDAs since the Palm 1.0 and this is the app Ive always wanted.  Its great to be able to do the taxing stuff on my desktop machine while Im relaxing with a good book or game in another room.  Also great for when I'm travelling and need to look up something at home or even send it to myself.  Even handles sound and high end graphics so that any mp3s or movies I'm not storing with amazon, I can still access.<br /><br />The interface took a little getting used to, but after a couple uses it's completely intuitive and I cant imagine doing it any other way.  Also setting up the remote computer and the whole login process are effortless.  Highly recommended!
B006VA57CY|5.0|We highly recommend both seasons. All the characters are really good and it's great how each and every one has a good story. At the beginning of the first season I didn't like the grandmother much, but now I think she is my favorite character. Can't wait for season 3
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow! I'm so glad I found this collection just by browsing through the lists of most popular Kindle books.  Once I started Wool, I truly couldn't put it down.  I was truly engrossed in the story and after reading Book 6, I really can't wait for more.  Thank you Hugh and keep up the great work!
B005LAII9O|5.0|\\"Savages\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Laguna Beach entrepreneurs Ben, a peaceful and charitable Buddhist, and his closest friend Chon, a former Navy SEAL and ex-mercenary, run a lucrative, homegrown industry--raising some of the best marijuana ever developed. They also share a one-of-a-kind love with the extraordinary beauty Ophelia (O). Life is idyllic in their Southern California town...until the Mexican Baja Cartel decides to move in and demands that the trio partners with them. When the merciless head of the BC, Elena, and her brutal enforcer, Lado, underestimate the unbreakable bond among these three friends, Ben and Chon--with the reluctant, slippery assistance of a dirty DEA agent--wage a seemingly unwinnable war against the cartel. And so begins a series of increasingly vicious ploys and maneuvers in a high stakes, savage battle of wills.<br /><br />The cast led by Taylor Kitsch (as Chon), Blake Lively (as O), Aaron Johnson (as Chon), John Travolta (as Dennis), Benicio Del Toro (as Lado) & Salma Hayek (as Elena) is great. The directing by Oliver Stone (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The screenplay (based on Don Winslow's novel) by Winslow, Stone & Shane Salerno (who also executive produced) is great.<br /><br />The music by Adam Peters is great. The cinematography by Dan Mindel is great. The film editing by Joe Hutshing, Stuart Levy & Alex Marquez is great. The casting by Sarah Finn is great. The production design by Tomas Voth is great. The art direction by Lisa Vasconcellos is great. The set decoration by Nancy Nye is great. The costume design by Cindy Evans is great. The stunts coordinated by Keith Woulard is great. The visual effects supervised by Paul Graff is great. The special effects supervised by Mark R. Byers is great. The special make-up effects by Nick Marra is great. The set designs by Yvonne Garnier-Hackl & Thomas Machan, set dresses by John Bevan Jr., Sean D. Jackson, Thomas D. Krausz & Douglas McKay is great.<br /><br />This is a great film that is well-made and entertaining. It is also well-acted, too. This is a great return for Oliver Stone. This is also a great summer film, one of the best films of the summer season. This is also a great film adaptation of a book to the big screen.
0307352145|5.0|I've always been fascinated by personality, especially introversion and extraversion (I created the introversion and extraversion tropes indexes on tv tropes, for example), and when I read about this book in Time, I couldn't help but pounce on it. I read through it back in February and again at the beginning of this month. It was hard for me to put down, because everything was so fascinating and informative. If you know someone who likes to keep to themselves and doesn't like being the center of attention, or you somply want to learn more about psychology, this is a great book to pick up.<br /><br />I only have two criticisms, which are more personal nigles than anything else. It did kind of annoy me that the word extravert was spelled extrovert throughout, though both spellings are correct. I just prefer the former (and there is a note on the author's preference for the latter at the end). Also the chapter on asian introversion was hard for me to get in to, because it was fairly alien to me, and I admit that I don't think I quite got it. This wasn't enough to ding the review score any, though. Overall, it was a great read.
B0044ZYJQS|4.0|The movie was extremely good.  Wonderful special effects and, as always, Robert Downey, Jr. was glib and right on as Stark...Very happy to have this Blu-Ray in my collection.Was it worth paying a lot more for the special metal box?  Not really. If it had been a 3-D release, maybe, but one major problem with this was that the inside plastic that held the discs was broken which means that no money was spent on making the inside of the box \\"Iron!\\"

It was the first time I have read any books set in Sweden and though I had difficulty with the names of cities, streets, I managed to work around it.  Just loved them and feel badly that he has passed on and we won't have more of his thrilling stories to enjoy.

0439023521|5.0|Have you been suspicious about the actions of the GOP, but not taken the time to research it? Just read this book. Starting oil wars, blowing up unions and stripping workers rights, war profiteering, hiding money in foreign accounts, not funding education, redistributing wealth to a small number of people, controlling the media, joining forces with corporations, stripping women's rights, making the government our enemy (our only means of stopping them is the government) creating 80% of the current debt while blaming the other party, stripping voters rights (starting with the most likely to vote for the other guys, but that will just make it easier to take voting rights from everyone). They are evil, but not stupid. They know the climate is changing, they know we are in for one weather related disaster after another, but they deny it while going for a money grab so that when the time comes to rebuild they will have the money and the control. Yes this is the GOP manifesto.

B0077SGMXM|4.0|The game starts easy and fun enough but pretty soon you will be ready to scream and hurt people. The game rewards you for persistence, unlocking more content, but only if you score low enough on each course. You better pick your Powerups carefully because the maps get so brutal you won't even have a remote chance of finishing them at or under par if you don't. This game is great but not for the impatient (or those prone to throwing their Android devices across the room..)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had no idea what Fifty Shades of Grey was about when I first started reading the first book.  The story line was very interesting and captivating.  It is a page turner for sure!  I found it was a love story with a lot of erotic imagery. After describing parts of the book to my husband, he started to read it!  I will finish the third book soon.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|For anyone who has enjoyed the Game of Thrones series I highly recommend this book (this is the first one I have read through). If you always want more when the hour program is finished here is the way to continue with your favorite character's journey.  I like that each chapter is about one character and from the TV series knowing what each character looks like and how they act - it is delicious!  The writing is so detailed you can easily get immersed in the adventures, in fact be forewarned that it is hard to put this very long book down!
1466401885|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. I have never been so hooked on a book this bad . I have read it 6 times and still can't seem to put it down .
B005OHSNMG|2.0|Zooey Deschanel is a real talent and the \\"awkward schtick\\" that she does in this series is funny. A show built around her would definitely have promise, but this falls way short. The writing is flaccid and the comedy is often too broad. And the co-stars are nowhere near as talented as she and it ruins what could have been a great vehicle. But that's what happens when you choose a cast based on who's Jewish rather than who's the most talented.  I'm referring here to actor Jake Johnson (Jewish despite the Anglo name) and then most especially Max Greenfield who is not only awful and a total amateur, but is so homely it's genuinely painful to look at his face.
B000WQWPKA|1.0|Which is the main point of my review.  The picture and audio are excellent.  However, this does NOT include the extended edition/director's cut that the DVD package does.  Amazon REALLY needs to have reviews BLATANTLY differentiate between the two formats (DVD/Blu-Ray) because I mistakenly read the DVD review when buying this blu-ray.
B005HEELRC|5.0|This is THE Original Pilot [TOP] for Star Trek. Be a real Trekkie Nerd and add this to your collection. I cant believe I'm the first to review \\"The Cage\\" so thank you to Amazon, Paramount and the millions of Trekkies who didn't want to be the first.<br /><br />Roddenberry pitched every network and studio he could think of to produce the pilot and show finally pitching to Lucille Ball of Desilu Productions. Gene referred to Trek as \\"wagontrain to the stars\\". NBC censored TOP claiming Spock [Leonard Nimoy] was too Satan-ish, a female Number 1 [Majel Barrett] was \\"unrealistic\\", and no way could there any women on the Bridge. Because of NBC, we have a TOS that is extremely different than Roddenberry's vision.<br /><br />TOP was produced in 1965 and finally aired in 1986 as filler for Star Trek: The Next Generation [TNG] because of the writers strike.<br /><br />TOP's crew is completely replaced except for Spock. [No Kirk, Sulu, Checkov, Scott, or Uhura until NBC makes him change things.]<br /><br />TOP was re-used as a flashback for the \\"Courtmarshall\\" season finale cliffhanger.<br /><br />TOP Enterprise is commanded by Captain Christopher Pike [Jeffrey Hunter] and is investigating a distress signal from Talos IV, a planet in the far distant Talos system. During the survey of the signal's origin, Pike retires to his quarters and summons ship's Doctor Boyce [John Hoyt] who makes a martini for Captain Pike and says \\"sometimes a man'll tell his bartender things he'll never tell his doctor\\". You gotta love this stuff, right?? The Enterprise is recognizable on the outside, but inside she resembles a 1950's sci-fi set.<br /><br />Although the dialogue is very 60=ish, Roddenberry brings modern issues [like racial and sexual equality] and relationship building [Pike opening up to the Doctor about his conflicts and concerns] into his mythology as much as action and adventure. This formula is the success of Trek.<br /><br />Once the planet is reached, Pike sends a landing party to investigate. We meet Vina [Susan Oliver], the lone survivor of the SS Columbia, a long lost Earth ship. When Vina meets Number 1, she tries to insult Number 1 by comparing her to a computer [Majel Barrett went on to be the computer voice for all Trek series and movies, including ST09]. Vina refers to Pike as a \\"prime specimen\\" and lures Pike behind a door that once closed, the landing party and Enterprise cannot breach. Inside, Pike is imprisoned to be Vina's mate, and lead to believe he is reliving events contained in his memory. Here begins the meat of the story.<br /><br />I dont want to give up too much because TOP is only about a hour long and you might want to experience this lost episode for yourself - especially if you've seen every last episode of TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise, and any [or all] the movies.<br /><br />I hope you all enjoy this discarded episode as much as I have. Live long and prosper.
B00000F14B|1.0|Love the quality of the movie. Hate the quality of this version. As others have noted, my DVD player has issues playing this. The beginning is great, but then around the \\"Last Days of Pompeii\\" scene culminating in \\"Sincere\\" the picture has pixel issues and my player has issues tracking it. Cleaning, polishing, and buffing the disk surface helped a bit but not enough so I think a major problem is with pressed DVD layer itself. I thought my copy might be an isolated example until I read some other reviews. I'm getting another copy of this great movie, but the 2011 version this time.
B0086700CM|1.0|cant download this app or any other one........ idk why its just say appstore is not supported in ur region.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I never expected to laugh out loud so much once I finally chose to go on this journey! Besides being very steamy, which everyone knows about going in, I found these books very funny as well. Almost from the beginning I pictured Anne Hathaway as the lead character. She has that same delicious sense of awkwardness that Ms Hathaway does so well. I also enjoyed Ms James' character development and the way her characters all relate to and interact with one another immensely. I will probably finish Book III of the trilogy today and have enjoyed them all very much! Sam :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After watching season 1, I just couldn't wait for season 2 to become \\"publicly' available.  I can say that Season 2 was even better. This was my first purchase of video from Amazon - the process was easy & the video was high quality.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Yes, as my title clearly states, this was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I know that because I literally did nothing ALL DAY today but read it, eager to find out what would happen next. I hate long winded reviews that are basically a readers version of the synopsis, so I will simply say that if you like a riveting, twist filled, curiosity feeding story that completely flips you on your head midway through the book...you'll be very pleases with Gone Girl as well.<br /><br />I will say, one thing I didn't love was the ending. Don't mistake me, this was still an unbelievable book from start to finish, and I did not feel cheated or let down by the ending, but I was just hoping for a different outcome...maybe a little bit more at the finish line.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|simple fun and worth playing. its easy to play and you can't beat free for a price. ive never had so much fun pretending to be a foreigner.
0679745203|5.0|Quite a few years ago, I read Michael Ondaatje's Anil's Ghost and was drawn to the story because of the beautiful way in which he told it and the mystery behind it. I, however avoided The English Patient because it was so popular and so many people who I knew did not care for it. I should know better than rely on even those readers whose taste are similar to mine as we have enough divergences. I've discovered this before and I discovered it yet again with Ondaatje's The English Patient .<br /><br />I love Ondaatje's writing. His prose is beautiful and I can find passage after passage that moves me. What I particularly love about his writing that he uses it as a shroud to envelope his story in a mystery so dark that this reader is compelled to continue. I can't wait to find out what is really going on, but Ondaatje like a magician with a sleight of hand leaves me wondering, \\"did that happen or was it that instead?\\"<br /><br />The story begins towards the end of World War II in an abandoned Italian villa with Hana, a Canadian nurse caring for a single badly burned English patient of unknown name or origin. Soon Caravaggio, a friend of Hana's father arrives. His skills as a thief were valued for espionage during the war. His hands are bandaged and he sought Hana's company:<br /><br />\\"At night sometimes, when the English patient is asleep or even after she has read alone outside his door for a while, she goes looking for Caravaggio. He will be in the garden lying along the stone rim of the fountain looking up at stars, or she will come across him on a lower terrace. In this early-summer weather he finds it difficult to stay indoors at night. Most of the time he is on the roof beside the broken chimney, but he slips down silently when he sees her figure cross the terrace looking for him. She will find him near the headless statue of a count upon whose stub of neck one of the local cats likes to sit, solemn and drooling when humans appear. She is always made to feel that she is the one who has found him, this man who knows darkness, who when drunk used to claim he was brought up by a family of owls.\\"<br /><br />Shortly after Caravaggio's arrival Kip an Indian sapper, who is an expert at finding and disarming bombs, IED's and explosives which are scattered about Italy. Each of these four are compelling characters who Ondaatje examines, but always leaves some doubt as to their true purpose and the demons and hurt which drive them.<br /><br />This is a novel about war and its consequences, and about love and betrayal . The reader is left in the end with much to consider. Lovers of happy endings may indeed be disappointed, but I loved it.she is the one who has found him, this man who knows darkness, who when drunk used to claim he was brought up by a family of owls.\\"<br /><br />Shortly after Caravaggio's arrival Kip an Indian sapper, who is an expert at finding and disarming bombs, IED's and explosives which are scattered about Italy.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great version of this game.  Very User friendly with good options to personalize to your own preference.  Love it!
0393340244|3.0|I read the German edition of this book. In my perception, Cordula Fine missed the topic.<br /><br />Research is not yet at an end. Nobody really knows the differences between the sexes. It is obvious, that there must be differences, because sex exists. It is also true, that many of the differences, which we perceive, have a cultural origin. We exaggerated these differences. This exaggeration is basically easy to notice. It could never  be true, that only women had the ability to cook and sew, because there were very related male professions.<br /><br />As Mrs. Fine demonstrates, humans can deepen their differences or they can suppress them. So the real question seems  to me, what we want. We have to weigh the consequences. It is only one time more, that a book about sexual differences shows the importance of our wishes.<br /><br />If we look at the development of children, one can see to tendencies. They want to be treated fair. This often means \\"equal\\". But they also want to be distinguishable. Siblings often develop behaviour to find an unoccupied role.<br /><br />So the real question for me is: Do men and women WANT to be distinguished? And if they want it: How can one make it fair.<br /><br />To be equal, is a special interest, that arrises, if someone has the impression, that she or he is treated unfair.<br /><br />So the main question in my opinion is: How important is a sexual identity for us? What about our relations, our meaning of life, if we reduce sexual identity as far as we can? Our world is cultural, is constructed. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the theoretically possible constructions?
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild is a story of adventure and personal healing. Cheryl Strayed is a very strong person to be able to hike the Pacific Crest Trail by herself.  What she gained was phenomenal and her writing talent makes her story even better. A life experience told with depth and truth.
055350259X|5.0|I'm only about one-third into the audio book, and it's my first Bill Bryson book, but I am enjoying it immensely. I won't repeat what others have reported, but I want to emphasize that the narration of the audio book is excellent. I would venture to say that it even enhances the prose with subtle nuances that lend humor, insight and intimacy. I walk often, and devour audio books, and I know that poor narration kills even a great story. Again, the narration adds a wonderful new dimension to the text.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Definite page turner. Very captivating read. I couldn't put it down. I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good thriller!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is easy to use, entertaining.  The price is right.  It is fast to load and use.  The rules of the game are intuitive, so there is no learning curve.
B00005BJPO|5.0|Absolutely the greatest anime I've ever seen. Epic animation, direction, story, realization. The audio track is more believable than the American release with the poorly done redub. The tin case is an excellent display piece. A must have for true fans, even the bluray version isn't as cool.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|Having previously read about the case on which the movie was based, I \\"went into it\\" with a pretty good familiarity with the \\"storyline\\". While the movie stayed fairly consistent with the actual case facts,  there was nothing special about the movie's presentation of these facts. The \\"play\\" was actually rather mediocre - and overly long.  As far as the actors, unlike many of the other reviewers on this site,I was UNimpressed with Gosling's \\"wooden\\" portrayal of the mad, cross-dressing murderer; I normally like Gosling - but in this movie, he just didn't deliver a believable character - unlike his costars,Dunst & Langella, both of whom provided credible performances.  I have rated the movie overall as a \\"3\\"- viewing it contextually (since I didn't pay anything to watch it as comparable to a \\"TV movie\\". Had I been required to pay for its viewing, however, I probably would have rated it a \\"2\\".
B004KA9VGA|5.0|Wonderful book....perfect selection of intrigue, history and romance! Bring on book two! Deborah Harkness is to be congratulated on a sure winner to stand the test of time!
B00683JLXA|2.0|I have this for the Windows Phone, &amp; I love it. I was happy to pay $0.99 to put it on my fire.<br /><br />Until I noticed the &quot;market&quot; icon. THIS APP ALLOWS FOR IN APP PURCHASES.  That is supposed to be in the description. I can't trust this with my under -10 year old now: he cannot understand finances, or our family's current financial state, and I will NOT put up with the constant badgering for Things We Neither Need Nor Can Afford that marketers &amp; producers seem to encourage.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'll have to uninstall this for now. Which is a shame, because I love it on WP. But now that Ximad is porting their stuff to Android, maybe that is why they haven't fixed bugs in the WP version.<br /><br />Ximad has probably now lost a long-time customer. I will think 3 times before buying now.
B004FOA84A|2.0|one of my favorite parts of point and click adventure games are the stories. this one seemed like it was written by a 12 year old. the puzzles were very simple. it took less than an hour to get through.<br /><br />the upside: graphics were good and I guess I should cut it.some slack due to the lack of point and click adventure games in the app store.
B006RUJST6|4.0|Excellent read! Read it all in one afternoon! I couldn't put it down! I wouldn't change a single thing, I would only ADD a bit more \\"romance\\" if you get my drift....
B0073LWEXK|4.0|puzzles were not too hard. the game zips along. could have used a bit more back story but overall it was fun.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read all three books in the trilogy.  I found the first book to be a bit much but the other two were better.  The story line was different from any I had read before.  Good book to discuss as so many were reading it.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I love this album! Adele is an amazing singer.  Her voice is incredible and it's no wonder she won all those Grammys!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read all three books and found book 2 and 3 to be the best.  Wanting to find out how it would end kept me reading.  With so many reading the trilogy, there was always someone wanting to discuss it.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|One reviewer said that this is a movie that needs to be watched several times to really understand it.  I watched this the other night and came away feeling the same way and it was one film that really left an impact on me.  I guess that's what a good movie should do even though this one was very disturbing and really didn't have any happy moments in it.  It was hard to understand how a dancer like Nina could be so impassioned and still be able to perform.  Her personality was almost devoid of any character, kind of lifeless and sort of moving from one scene to the next just willing to move one foot in front of the other.  The world of ballet was portrayed as kind of a highly competitive almost vicious atmosphere.  Take the scene for instance when the prima ballerina, Beth, is denied the lead role and retires from the company.  I didn't realize at the time that Winona Ryder was in that role and I think that she has really matured to take on a part that was so difficult and punishing as we see her all mangled and bruised and bitter.  Barbara Hershey as the domineering mother was especially good in that role and they couldn't have picked a more talented actress for the part--a disgruntled, \\"has-been\\" dancer whose career was cut short by giving birth to Nina.  Then there is Lily this amoral newcomer on the scene who becomes almost a nemesis to Nina but awakens a passion in her that embodies the Black Swan.  All the scenes of dreams and surreal images are pretty effective and gives the feeling that it's hard to distinguish them from reality, which poor Nina is subject to all throughout the movie.  We witness her self mutilation and just utter helplessness as she tries to perform to the artistic director's demands, her mother's demands, and in the end it's just too much!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read all three books in the trilogy.  I found it to be a fast read.  The first book was a bit much but the two after it were better.  The story line was different from any I had read before.  That was what kept me reading.  I had to find out how it would end.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I think book three was too predictable. I liked the first two books better. Book three just seem to repeat alot of the sex scenes from the previous ones. The media made this series sound like it was something so very different but in my opion in hte end it was a love story with a mild twist. Boy meets girl...girl is curious and they live happily ever after. I work in the mental health field so I can appreciate the struggles of a character like 50 shades... not very far from reality if you ever dealt with a client who has suffered significant trauma. I would recommend these books as an entertaining read and I like all the sexual content but I can see how some less opened minded individuals may not appreciate the creativity!
B005NFJAZS|5.0|The DVD was very reasonably priced and arrived in perfect condition in a padded mailer. This was just the version I've been looking for, and was glad to finally have it. Thanks! :-)
B007EC6FIS|5.0|I love this album, maybe the best up to now from Keane. I do not get bored of listening to Keane's music. I strongly recommend it![[ASIN:B007EC6FIS Strangeland (Deluxe)]]
0297859390|5.0|Wow! I don't think I have ever read a book quite like this one. It was recommended to me by a friend. She said it was an unbelievable story, and she wasn't kidding. Unbelievable in a good way, not like an \\"Are you kidding me? That would never happen.\\" kind of way. I'm not even sure how to review it without giving too much a way. It's a story that has to tell itself. It needs to unravel little by little and lead you around by the nose until you're left shaking your head in the end.<br /><br />It starts off pretty benign. This relatively affluent, great-looking, New York couple falls on hard times. It is their fifth wedding anniversary, and their marriage has hit a rough patch. Then, she's gone. Just up and disappears. Looks like foul play. Is it? It's always the husband, isn't it? The author deftly takes the reader through their blissful courtship, joyful early years of marriage, grueling struggle and break-down of their relationship, and ultimate culmination of their relationship.<br /><br />The story is told from both the husband and wife's perspectives. Each chapter alternates from Amy's point of view to Nick's point of view. Since she disappears fairly early on, much of her voice is told through her diary. Nick's is told in the present tense as the investigation proceeds. Both characters are very complex. Amy's upbringing has produced in her a perfectionist that cannot stand to be seen as anything less than flawless. Nick is a Momma's boy. He is a pleaser and charmer. Each struggles to be the other's ideal without losing themselves in the process. As their facades begin to crumble and they fail themselves and each other, things go terribly awry.<br /><br />This is a book that has you thinking one thing, then throws you for a loop in another direction, only to change it up and eventually leave you holding your head in bewilderment. A great read. Couldn't put it down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book 3 was good but I already figured out the ending after book one. Still it is a great read and I couldn't put it down.
B0031RS588|4.0|To me this is a powerful book. Once the initial disquiet re the language dissipates, there is here a window on a way of life unfamiliar, i would imagine to many. Where as this might not be a great advertisement for Scottish culture, the depiction of the angry , chip on the shoulder, violent Scots male makes compelling reading.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 was the best in the series. The author not only had a superb story line, but the depth of her writing is spell binding. She let us into a unique world that is only sexual fantasy to some.
B00004XQ83|5.0|get this and a hot tub and a big ole' chunky southern siren and a half case of budweiser and spin this disk and just imagine the fun instore...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it.  it is so fun to lay back and be Irish.  if you like Mario this is the game for you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun little mini games to waste a few minutes here and there. once you get so far into it the challenge becomes racking up enough points to unlock the next game. it will be fun until the next game requires too many points and the games already unlocked are boring.
B004ZNACA6|3.0|cd's are cd's but for the price you would think that you would have better cases instead of folded cardboard.  that is my only complaint.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book as a whole is not a bad read.  If you are looking for an intellectually stimulating book, this is not for you (though I did find myself utilizing the dictionary feature of my Kindle App more than ever for this book).  However, if you can tolerate the over-used character archetypes and plot lines with a sexy twist and painfully overused statements then it is one you may consider picking up.  I would recommend that if you are skeptical, consider ordering this through a local library system (mine fortunately offered ebook loans).  I am glad I waited for my ebook loan as I am not convinced the book is worth $10, nor the series $30.<br /><br />I have read the entire Twilight (which I will admit I enjoyed) series and to me, this book follows a very similar foundation (at least book one, 2 & 3 haven't become available for loan, again, I am not paying $10/book).  Gorgeous, dangerous man meets young, innocent, coy girl with self-esteem issues and instantly they begin this internal/external battle about wanting each other.  As fate should have it they are brought together and girl finds out the dark secrets of said boy and she is both shocked and turned on by \\"his world\\".<br /><br />The 3 main differences I see in the two stories are:<br />1 -> Characters themselves (obviously)<br />2 -> Werewolf/vampire bit<br />3 -> A lot of sex (but you have to read good bit of the book before they kick in, but when they do, it's averaging 4x a day)<br /><br />Otherwise, it seems to me like E L James read Twilight, decided she liked the story but it was missing the sex, tweaked a few small things, and BAM! published a book.<br /><br />Now if you are a fan of Twilight, you will probably be all about it and see a lot of the similarities as I did.  I will read the rest of the series seeing as I have started it and I am interested to see how it continues based on the ending of book one.
B00881VLCE|4.0|it helps to spend time but I would like a better selection of puzzles. I had no problems with moveing pieces.
B000AYEL6U|2.0|Good movie but disc 2 has a crack and wont play.  Unfortunately, I waited too long to watch (or open it) to return it.  Lesson learned.  Love the story so far though. I'd definitely recommend buying, but open it as soon as you get it and check out the discs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm sorry...I had to give it a star otherwise I couldn't submit my review.  I want my money back!  Good grief...I am smarter than this!!
034580404X|5.0|This was my first purchase from Amazon, it was quick, easy and the best part inexpensive. I got a great deal, I had already looked around book stores, and to get all three for the price I did was the deal breaker.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This was a great movie.  We watched it twice back to back cause it is fast moving and wanted to see parts that we missed the first time.
0307949486|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of this type of book (crime novels), but after all the hoopla about Dragon Tattoo I decided to give it a try. I wasn't disappointed. Liz Salander, a troubled young woman who is also world class computer hacker and into body piercings, tattoos and kinky sex, teams with Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced Swedish journalist, to solve the disappearance and possible murder of a young girl years ago. What they discover makes for a shocking conclusion. I highly recommend this book.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This show is the best.  The plot twists and surprises.  In my opinion, this is the best season to date, which says a lot.

B0087DFIYA|5.0|I have always enjoyed movies with Mel Gibson in them and this was a great one! Full of action and adventure, you get to see Mel Gibson in an amazing thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. I know that some people have had concerns with Gibsons' actions in the past, but for me, I look at the work of the actor, and this is just another great example of the versatility that he offers in the movies that he is in. This movie is not for young eyes, but it is a movie that places you in a different role than I have seen him in in quite some time and it was a great change and he did a great job (as did the other actors in the film. If you have not seen this, I encourage you to see this today!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game. I can play it in my free time without everything bring broken when I return.

0439023513|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. Unlike many teen novels, it is well written and delivers precise, methodical accounts of the characters journeys. In this final installment, however, there are many questions left unanswered about the ending. We all want her to choose Peeta because he truly loves her but why is he in 12. Katniss and Haymitch are banished to 12 but Peeta is still not stable upon his return so how did they reconnect? We want to know that Peeta was not chosen by default which is what it looks like since she says it takes 5,10,15 years to have kids. Is she really waiting for Gale to come back? Haymitch had such a significant role in this series and there is nothing to say about his life even though he is with katniss and Peeta. Hopefully the movie version will be forced to close these gaps.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|love it! kids love it! better than the real thing for that matter! works great on my kindle fire! sm!

I advise you to download this game. Trust me, you won't regret it. Anyway who wouldn't download a fun game that's free?
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Okay, let me just start this off by saying that i did not discover the books before the show. I was introduced to the show by one of my old friends, she said she saw the first season and loved it. I had Netflix and it was on there so i decided to give it a go. I can honestly say that i am in love with the show. I have been hooked ever since i saw the first season. I got so into it that i started to read the series of books. And don't get me wrong i still love the show to death, and it will always be my favorite show. However i can say that i do enjoy the books a little more. The story line is more diverse and it has more twists and turns that just keep you hooked. The show has just as many twists but they are just a tad more expected in the show than the ones in the books. But one thing i can say is that i honeslty enjoy the way they portray the characters more in the show. If the characters in the books were exactly the same as the characters in the show, I would be in total vampire heaven..But out of 5 stars i rate this show a 5 :)
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This has become my favorite go-to game whenever I have some time to play a game.  Works great on my HTC Inspire.  Dozens of different courses to master, each one better than the last.  A definite keeper!
B005LAIH54|4.0|I read a lot of the reviews & didn't quite know what to expect, but I liked it.  How could you go wrong with Liam Neeson?  I think you got the drift whether you saw Clash or not,  Anyway it was a fun escape!
B008578PMU|3.0|The dog fighting scenes are great, but the acting is poor with the exception of Cuba Gooding Jr. And Terrence Howard. This could of been a great movie but I gotta say I wish I hadn't spent the money.
0099579936|2.0|I liked the story.  I can't tell you why, because I honestly don't know.  Maybe because the characters are so generic and vague that it's easier to insert myself into the story (which is the point of fiction, isn't it?)<br /><br />That being said, I hated the writing. It was unbelievably annoying that the only descriptors that Ana uses are \\"oh my\\" or sometimes \\"oh my(in italics)\\" or even \\"OH MY! (in italics with exclamation points!!)\\" Ive read a LOT of erotica (don't judge!) and one of the things I love about it is that when describing, the authors get....creative. One of the most common penile descriptors I always read (not just in erotica but also in just plain old romantic fiction) is the ever-overused \\"velvet encased steel rod\\".  sounds cheesy.  I can't ever remember thinking those words in the throes of passion.  BUT.  it sounds a hell of a lot better than \\"down there\\".  Ana, quite literally, never uses descriptive terms beyond those two words.<br /><br />HOWEVER.  I think people aren't really aware that this was originally written as Twilight Fanfiction.  Ana and Christian were originally named Bella and Edward.  The author changed (or was forced maybe?) the names of the main characters, but they are, in essence, still a nameless, faceless, shapeless, completely blank-slate of a girl (Bella/Ana) and an absolutely unrealistic, over-the-top, wealthy UNsparkly boy (Edward/Christian).  I can only imagine that since the Twilight series didn't include any sex scenes, just the basic fade-to-black, that the author of Fifty Shades thought to herself \\"if they had sex, it would probably be like this...\\" and she took pen to paper.<br /><br />The comparisons between Twilight and Fifty Shades.....There aren't really any.  They are basically the same books.  An awkward immature girl whose life didn't exist before she meets her hero an a hero who might as well have been named \\"John E. Fantasy\\". (The E stand for Everywomans) Even before I knew that the story was originally Twilight fanfiction, I saw the parallels.<br /><br />My biggest issues: At one point, Christian tells Ana to bend over, and actually pulls out her tampon to have sex with her.  This is my main point of contention with the entire book. I've never known a guy who is even comfortable looking at an unopened box of tampons, let alone one that is actually in use.  This is, honest to god, the most unrealistic thing I've ever read.  When I read that sentence, I actually had to put the book down and laugh out loud (much to the dismay of my tampon-fearing husband).  I know...it's fiction...you have to suspend your disbelief...but come on!!!! But then again, maybe I just don't know as much about the Dom/Sub scene as I thought.  Maybe REAL Doms are into tampon removal? I don't know.<br /><br />Ana orgasms on command.  This also does not happen in real life.  At least, not EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU HAVE SEX.  I can understand maybe if you were really REALLY turned on and your significant other was REALLY good at dirty talk, and that's what you are into.  It might (MIGHT) work once.  But this girl, literally, comes on command.  I could even see the significance of that being part of the BDSM scene, except in the context of this story, it's not.  She's just SOOOOOO turned on that him saying \\"come\\" actually makes her come.  If there are any virgins reading this book, or even this review, please be informed: This has never happened in the history of vaginas.  (it'd be a lot cooler if it did though...)<br /><br />There are more, but I really don't have the time.  because I'm going to write a book.  I've always wanted to write fiction, but thought to myself \\"no, I'll fail\\"  My vocabulary skills are not strong enough.  I can't describe things clearly enough for the reader to understand.  But clearly, I was wrong.  Apparently, I can write an entire series of fiction using only 3 or 4 descriptive terms (over and over and over) and write a best seller.  So keep your eye open for my book.  MaybeI'll name my hero John E. Fantasee......
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent book 2, makes me read faster to get to book 3!!  You fall in love with the 2 main characters, as I am sure all who read are able to see part of their own lives through Christian and Ana.
B004FOA84A|4.0|fun game. could use a few hints. played the hole game in one setting. wish it was longer. will try more games like this.
B004UID2LC|3.0|how do you even rename a song file? you can't put. who the artist or song is. little disappointed. tubemate is lil better
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love all three of these books I brought them back in April an read them six times or more since then  .I do read other books but  then I find myself going back to read 50 shades again I have them on my kindle then brought them on paperback  can not wait for the movie to come out but until then I will have to re- read  them again again because I love love these books .
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My 5-year old daughter loves the wall decals and shared the stickers with her friends. The package exceeds my expectation.
B00846REIS|3.0|I thought this was a good book but I have to say 50 Shades of Grey is still number on my list .I read this book in a day and a half and can not wait  to read the second book that coming out in  October . But I must say it seen like sylvia took some classes from E L james because the  story reads almost the same as  50 shades .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the different choices. something for everyone!<br />I love serpent! I love race car. and the parachute game rocks! love. it
030758836X|5.0|I am an avid reader. I fully agree with the numerous 5 star reviews. This book was uniquely written and a fun read. Go get it before someone spoils it for you by making the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is fun it's entertaining for the kids and even for me lol! It has cute little people on it too.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|classic wait to build or buy game. cute ties to great movie franchise. similar to farmville or frontierville. good eniough to hold attention for a while...
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I love this!! Add \\"Client 9\\" to this little number and you will have another excellent chapter to this ongoing story of greed, power, corruption and deception. This is better than fiction any day!!  Well presented, full, rich (so to speak), fast moving, exciting, interesting documentary.  I want more!! Again, another film I have watched a number of times on the Internet, now it is a precious addition to my library of \\"nothing but the best\\" films.  Matt Damon is a great narrator. Excellent research, succinct, opens more doors / windows to more - Insights.  All thumbs up.  Get it and share it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it great u have so many games to play and u don't have to download a lot of apps<br /><br />Jennifer
B004132HZS|5.0|I have read and watched everything Sherlock I could get my hands on, and when I saw this on PBS I found I had to get this too.  Very well done.  Get it!
B00428CPUY|5.0|Great music I love the whole thing. I thought it was a cd but o well just can't listin to it in my car.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|Wow.  I really wasn't expecting much, since nothing really seems to phase me anymore.  If you liked Paranormal Activity, you'll like this.  If you have seen so many horror movies that nothing scares you anymore, turn off the lights and watch this one.  Impressive.
B00005N5S5|5.0|My order was put in July 2,2012.it came before due date like express, couldn't wait. I am very pleased with.
0446572993|4.0|It has been a while since I've read a Baldacci, a Grisham or a Cornwell that I love, but David Baldacci's \\"The Innocent\\" I really love.  This one sucked me into the very center of the story from the first page.  It seemed that every page held a new twist or turn, and how the complicated means by which the scattered pieces of the crimes to be solved would be brought together seemed almost impossible.  But brought together they were in an ending that turned out not as I expected.<br /><br />Will Robie is an assassin employed by the U.S. Government.  His assignments have taken him all over the world to kill in order to protect people, but Robie has a conscience.  When he is given an assignment to kill a government employee, he quietly breaks into the apartment and gets ready to shoot, but sees something that makes him stop and he doesn't make the kill.  It doesn't go over well with a lot of people who are his superiors.  However, when Robie fails to shoot, a sniper in the next building over does, and kills the target and has Robie in his sight, too.  He manages to escape the shooter and gets on a rickety bus to New York.  On the bus he meets a bright, but tough, 14-year-old girl named Julie. From this point on, the novel explodes into a complicated plot of twists and turns and was very hard to put down.<br /><br />Julie has been in one foster care home after another because of drug use by her parents, but she always manages to make her way to her real home again.  The foster home she is in when the story begins is far worse than anything she would experience in her own house.  When Julie returns to her parents' place this last time, she witnesses their murders and manages to escape with her life.  She heads for the same bus that Will Robie is on, but with Robie sitting behind her. With a suspicious-looking man sitting between him and Julie, Robie knows that something isn't right.  Julie trusts no one and so far has done a good job of keeping herself alive after her parents' murders.  Robie wants to see that she stays that way.  As the story advances, FBI Agent Nicole Vance is assigned to help Robie find who is hunting down Robie and Julie and why.  There are several factors that Robie and Vance have to somehow piece together in order to find who the guilty parties are who are after them.  But finding out who the real target is up to Robie.  He just isn't sure if it's Julie or himself.<br /><br />The characters of Will Robie, Julie, and Nicole Vance are characters I really cared about and would love to see again.  By the end of the book, I thought that I knew them pretty well.  It would be a very nice thing to see Robie, Vance and Julie in another book in order to see how these characters' lives continue.  Will Robie might be an assassin who kills only people who want to hurt his country and its people, but he's an assassin with a heart who I can't help but like.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|are available from the start and others are to hard to achieve I would like it if this would change and maybe 30 games were unlocked
1595828753|5.0|I was excited to get these books and know what else the team would get into after ye series ended and so far am in love with it!
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|A nice and compact collection of one of the defining series of 90s American TV culture.<br /><br />The series is not only a manifestation of teen culture but its a representation of an Era in its finest glory.<br /><br />I d recommend everyone to purchase this if you are fan of dawsons creek and more importantly, a fan of good tv
B004EC5IUW|4.0|Fantastic remake of the original anime. Shingi is developed in a much better way, and more likable. Rei definitely got her own spot light that is well deserved. The best thing i like about this remake is that there is no more useless physiological bull crap (like the last few episodes of the original Eva series). A lot more action a lot cooler battle. 2.22 is much better then 1.11 because its action nature. 1.11 setup the story up for 2.22. The only down side I can think of is that some angel battle are on the short side, but never the less it is still very cool.<br /><br />Best to watch this on a really big screen (65\\"+), and with surround sound. If you don't have any of these then go find a friend who does. It is well worth the effort!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this game reminds of playing Mario when I was a kid on our old nintendo game system I have had so much fun!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this has been a fun app so far.  sometimes the controls are a bit lethargic or slow to respond but it is fun and easy to learn the various games.
B0063IH60K|2.0|After recent update, annoying ads almost make you miss the not-whammied RANDOM game mode. Usually when you play, that one doesn't let you win; you have to select WINNING game mode for that. I've played Solitaire (the basic Windows PC v) since the late 1980s, and have never found one that has so many no-solution games -- and that's with only 1 card -- not the standard 3!<br /><br />If you use Solitaire as a general timewaster, and don't much care whether you can finish a game or not, this is for you. Otherwise, don't buy.
030758836X|4.0|I read the first couple of chapters on Friday night. Then picked it up on Saturday morning and didn't put it down again until I was finished (well after mid-night). Manipulative, suspenseful, disturbing - lots or twists and turns - at times I actually gasped and other times I clapped. Don't read the reviews - best to go into it without a lot of expectations (and you want to avoid spoilers). Really good summer/vacation book.
0345803485|1.0|I am not sure how this book has grown to be so popular.  Surely it isn't the only or first book with sex scenes in it?  I mulled my way through it hoping it would get better and the real love story would begin.  It didn't.  I know it is fantasy, but it is like something a 15 year old would fantasize about. Much of it is completely unbelievable.  A naughty, rich older man whose wealth is unmeasurable meets his princess who miraculously changes him with in a few weeks. And Ana, who is going into publishing, doesn't own a computer?  In today's world?  The sex scenes are fun at first, but then they repeat over and over and over.  And over.  Christian is just too stalker-ish and appears to have magical powers or something.  There's just so much wrong with this book with the lack of depth in the characters, no real plot, the repetitive phrases....  Overall, just very lame and a waste of time.
B006GM8NXM|5.0|I started watching this show because my best friend recommended it, and in the first few episodes I said \\"this is just Twilight with boobs and swearing\\"...which isn't a problem for me since I'm a huge Twilight fan.  But after watching the show more and more it has really become something completely different from Twilight or from any other super natural story I've seen.  You fall in love with the characters and the INSANE story lines.  I highly recommend this show.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved the charcters in this book! I really felt like I was living it with them. Jamie can tear your heart out like no other. She has mastered the chase.
0694003611|3.0|I don't mean to be a downer but I don't really understand why this book is such a classic.  It's good, sure, but there are MUCH better childrens' books out there.  I don't feel like this is a must have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been reading fiction for 25 years, everything that I could.  From Poe to King, Verne to Bradbury, you name it.  This series was great, can't wait for more.  I can easily see this becoming a movie or television series.
0920668364|5.0|If you have children and read this book you will cry.  And you will also cry any time you even think of this book lol.  I got this as a gift for my baby shower and read it for the first time when I was pregnant and I bawled.
0060557818|5.0|Thank you Neil Gaiman for both disturbing and entertaining me.  Bravo.  Calling all authors, if you'd like a crash course in how to write good bad guys, this is it.  Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are absolutely disgusting.  In a good way.
B007Y2W44W|4.0|When the first single was released online as a video people was afraid of the clean vocals heard, I must say they fit perfectly the songs. This is another great release by Nile, ultra-fast drumming, very complex guitar work, and as mentioned some new vocal style here and there. After a couple spins i can say tracks 2 and 3 are outstanding. Most die hard fans (me included) won't be dissapointed. As a side note, the artwork is just awesome.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great entertaining games to keep you and the kids busy on long car rides! It is definately worth the down load.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game keeps me occupied for longer than I want to admit to! it really is a lot of work trying to keep my little city growing and going. I don't know how long this review has to be to get the points ; but I seriously need them to fulfilled the goals in the game and I don't want to have to buy them.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|There are many times that you will have two if the exact same thing, and only one is clickable. Other times, you are told to search for a thing (crown, for example)  and there well be multiple types of that thing. For instance, king AND a queen crown. It makes for a very frustrating experience. Otherwise, exactly the same as every other hunt and seek game out there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game my friends and family. all love this game I hope other people enjoy this game as much as I do

B007KZY1YY|5.0|Absolutely loved these books!<br />I heard teachers, at the Christian college where my children attend, talking about Fifty Shades and decided to take a peek.  Oh boy... I'm so glad!<br />And I have been referring it to everyone since.<br />I'd love to hear more about Mia & Ethan and also Kate & Elliott. There are two new trilogy's right there!<br />Also can't wait to hear the rest of Christian's  side of it.....
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Upon buying my Kindle Fire, I wanted a protective case that wouldn't increase the weight of my tablet while still giving some protection from minor damage. I ordered this in black and it's holding up quite nicely. It's very sleek and lightweight, and most importantly it does not add bulk to the tablet. The price was also reasonable. I recommend this to those who want something to cover your kindle, protect it from minor damages and still be comfortable to hold in your hand(s).
B00633W614|3.0|I looked forward to The Sins and how the family would move on in time.  The ending was not a good one, sorry! How long before the next chronicle can be available??
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As my title reflects full of shock but completely enjoyed and could not wait to read book 2 .  I was ready for more.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband as he is a big Beatles fan. Great performances and enjoyable for Beatles fans to watch and add to their collection.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|This film has always stuck with me because i get the same beautifully uneasy feeling watching it, always feel just as lost and confused as michael douglas... music is great as well!
B00845PV16|3.0|First, I am a big Nicholas Cage fan.  Second, I really liked the first movie. Unfortunately and as much as I hate to say it, the best part of this movie was the twinkie.  The writers and directer basically castrated the ghost rider and made him into a big pansy.  Three things would have helped this movie.  1) Get rid of the ridiculous cackaling that Nicholas had to do in order to keep the ghost at bay.  It was distracting.  2) Give the badass priests more opportunity to be badass.  3) Bring blue ghost in on the final battle.<br /><br />Another reviewer said that this movie spells doom for the franchise.  I fear he is correct.  Too bad.
B007L96SI6|5.0|Haley meets Bruno meets Corrine. This CD delivers all the sass and funk you'd ever want along with a sweetness in that incredible voice. Great writiing by the artist herself. The more you listen up, the more you like.
B005HSL626|4.0|I lov to play it. its so fun to play everything about it is so fun. nothing I can say is bad about it
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I played it sometimes and now it wont let me get back in that's so dumb and there's not really anybody on it any more so I'm gonna delete this app
B0086700CM|5.0|its so fun to play and additive and I lov that its on the kindle now so that makes me like it even more :)
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a pretty fun game if your reading this. buy this game its really fun!!!.....by the way its FREE!!!!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I love this game its fun and cute to play. its a good game to play and adorable. and u can act like its your own restaurant
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has many great features and gives you many versions to read. It also lets u search by word
B001CDZZI6|5.0|My husband had me read this and take the test (he used it at work). I loved it!  Spot on correct in terms of my strengths.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning more about themselves.
B006YDG0KG|5.0|THE BOOK IS AN INSPIRATIONAL AND SPIRITUL GUIDE TO MANKIND.IT ALSO TAKES YOU THROUGH A PRACTICAL EXPERIANCE OF LIFE.WE GENERALY TAKE THINGS FORGRANTED AND ROUTINE WITHOUT REALISING THAT HOW MUCH EFFORT GOES INTO PROVIDING US THE BARE NECESSITIES OF LIFE.TO SAY THANKYOU TO GODALLMIGHTY AND TO ALL THOSE INVOLVED IS OUR DUTY.BY SAYING THAKYOU AND BEING GRATEFUL TO GOD CAN ACHICE YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT IN LIFE WOW;WONDERFUL READING.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Really simple, yet chalkenging; a fun app. Multiple difficulties which means the app never gets boring, and enough puzzles that you never run out.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|THE ART OF STORY TELLING HAS NEVER BEEN SO GOOD.ONE CAN NEVER LEAVE THE BOOK TILL THE LAST PAGE IS OVER.THE AUTHER HAS DONE JUSTICE TO HIS NAME AND FAME.THE BOOK GENTLY TOUCHES SOME SOCIAL ISSUES WITHOUT RAISING EYEBROWS.IT WAS WORTH READING.
0143119680|3.0|Ok, this was a fun read.  NOT intellectually challenging, but well written, and it's not painful.  On the other hand, it's basically a romance novel with some interesting ideas tossed in.<br /><br />I gave it a 3 because it's an average between 1 (because it's basically a romance novel) and 5 (good writing and interesting ideas).<br /><br />I enjoyed it, it held my interest and it was interesting enough to cause me to shirk responsibilities in order to finish it.<br /><br />That said, it's NOT Twilight which was so badly written I could not get through the first two chapters.  It's NOT juvenile, and thank God, it wasn't a bodice ripper.  There is some sex, but mostly not, and I appreciate that, as I prefer not to be a voyeur looking into other peoples (even fictional) sex lives.<br /><br />I'd buy it again, and I'll probably read the next two.  I won't put it on my best-reads-of-all-time list.
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a great game the only problem is that if you're not far in the game you can't get money fast
B007V2UGPE|3.0|Great game.  Sucks when you go to play after spending money to upgrade your character and the game crashes and you lose everything.  Need to fix the crash bug.
0606259090|1.0|I read this book because several people mentioned it to me.  Though the book is about sex, I failed to find it sexy.  The characters are both unbelievable, and frankly very annoying. I gave up several times, but friends encouraged me to continue. I did finish the story, but with great effort. I was left wondering why this book has been so successful? The writing is juvenile and the content leaves nothing to the imagination.  I read many kinds of stories and would never recommend this book to anyone.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I did enjoy the movie for what it offered. It is good entertainment with majestic imagery, mostly solid performances and absorbing music. Having said that, it is a movie not without its flaws. Some of them are hard to ignore.<br />&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; SPOILERS AHEAD &#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;<br /><br />A SHIP OF FOOLS<br />One would think that when someone is making a trillion dollar investment and, to boost, having his own immortality ride on this expedition, he would make a more careful selection of his team. Not slap together whoever happened to be waiting for the bus at the corner, right? So who did we get here?<br />-- A captain that is more interested in getting in the pants of the owner's dominating daughter than what enters his ship or not.<br />-- An archeologist (intense Rapace was a excellent fit for the role) who supposedly has faith but that seems to exhaust itself on clinging to her cross. However, I am willing to give this some leeway as it is bound to come up in the sequel(s). I am guessing sacrifice and probably I am not alone in this.<br />-- A geologist/gun expert that is so grossly stereotyped and has such a bad temper (no one thought of running a personality screen BEFORE launch, right?) that his (telegraphed) death is actually a relief.<br />-- A Biologist who is eager to abandon all notion of evolution in favor of an alien designer at the drop of a penny. And his sole contribution, when faced with an alien creature that looked like a cobra (fear of snakes is innate, mind you), was to try to...pet it, while uttering &#34;here, kitty-kitty-kitty!&#34;.<br />Of course, said...&#34;kitty&#34; eats his face off. As a Biologist myself, I felt shame - and I have to ask: of all the millions of Biologists on Earth, why did they choose this hooded hippie again?<br />-- The owner's daughter who decides to follow her father in order to cause his death and finally inherit him. Would it not make more sense to simply wish him farewell and stay behind on Earth? There was no way this ship of idiots would ever return!<br /><br />PLANET-SIZED PLOT HOLES<br />Suspension of disbelief is a requirement for almost every single movie and needed in a large dosage for every science fiction one. Nevertheless, there are some thorns in my side that would not let go.<br />-- A spaceship that is capable of traveling between stars, entering an alien atmosphere without burning up and and being set down like a helicopter wherever managed to catch the team's eye at the last moment? No one even thought of scouting and mapping out the planet first in order to have a landing plan, right?<br />-- Said magic spaceship can also accelerate like a sports car in Earth-like gravity at a 45 degrees angle (in order to ram the alien ship) and the captain manages to make it do this, not in an g-suit and strapped in a harness, but standing up in his loose-hanging veteran jacket.<br />-- The archeologists were pursuing their discovery whereas the rest of the rag-tag team probably needed the money. But why would ultra-rich Vicker's daughter go on a mission like this? Did she have a death wish to undertake such a dangerous (and haphazardly slapped together) mission?<br />-- Relativity is a heartless mistress. Gliese-86 is 35 light years away. That means that even at light-speed, it would take 70 years to get there and back. Did she leave no one she cared for behind? Because almost everyone she knew will be dead by the time she gets back.<br />-- Okay now, what WAS the plan? Meet with these alien creators so that Vickers can become immortal? Did they have any indication that thiswas even remotely possible? Then how would they know about the mutating alien and have a plan to bring it back in a host in stasis?<br /><br />I saw it in 3D and, with the exception of the first 3 minutes, it was not worth the glasses hassle. An interesting prequel to the Alien Saga.<br />I only wish they had given the script as much thought as they did the cinematography.was even remotely possible? Then how would they know about the mutating alien and have a plan to bring it back in a host in stasis?<br /><br />I saw it in 3D and, with the exception of the first 3 minutes, it was not worth the glasses hassle. An interesting prequel to the Alien Saga.<br />I only wish they had given the script as much thought as they did the cinematography.

B000A5044C|5.0|What can I say beyond the acting, directing, and cinematography was not just good but excellent on all accounts.  The young lead in the film, named Akira, a 12 yo boy [current age 22 at the time of this review] and played by Yuya Yojira won the best actor award at the 2004 Cannes film festival for his performance in this film as he should have. But all of his supporting cast were equally good.  The story concerns the abandonment of 4 children Akira, age 12, his sister Kyoko [played by Ayu Kitaura] about 11, Yuki [played by Momoko Shimizu], his five yo sister, and Shigeru played by Hiei Kimura] about Yuki's age in the film.  Their young mother Keiko Fukishima, played by the well known actress YOU, is a typical irresponsible parent, who has four kids by several men, but is looking to find love and happiness elsewhere without the obligations of taking care of her young family.  Through various periods of abandonment by the mother which becomes final abandonment, although she sends money earned from her various dalliances occasionally, it is never enough.  Therefore, the care of his family is placed upon the young Akira, who is a mere 12yo child himself and he along with his siblings are forced to refrain from formal schooling so no one will discover their true plight.  He finds young love with a cute school girl Saki [touchingly played by Hanae Kan], about his age, yet his youth is stymied by being thrust into an adult role way before he should take on such burdens for himself let alone three younger siblings.  Because no one is to find out about the mother's absence she sneaks them into a new apartment, the two youngest in suitcases, and says that only Akira is to show himself, of child welfare might come and take them away. He gets involved with the typical street kids and throughout one has a foreboding of tragedy about to strike.<br /><br />The story is touching, but depressing, and yet you can't divert your eyes from the drama unfolding before them. This is one film in which the suspension of disbelief is total due to all facets of its production. I have never so effusively praised a film before and watch at least 300 different films a year, but in this case everything about the film from the wonderful cinematography with great lighting, the acting by all, and the superb direction and script by Hirokazu Kore-eda deserve equal praise.  My only regret is that I didn't see this film when it first came out.<br /><br />I would strongly urge viewers of serious drama to purchase this fine film as it is one you will want to see over and over again.lm in which the suspension of disbelief is total due to all facets of its production.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|As each of my children have grown and gone, our copies of the Star Wars movies have gone with them.  Now we have the latest copy of the complete series and will hopefully keep this one!  All the additional nerdy stuff makes the stories more special.  And the remastering for blu-ray is fantastic.  The terrain and backgrounds are crisper and clearer, adding new dimension to the time honored tales.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the first book I read by the author.  I'm thinking about reading Dark Places, which seems to have gotten a half star more than Girl Gone.  I called the book a roller coaster, because I found reading Part One on the slow side, but Part Two picked up and went into overdrive, and how it ties in to Part One.  Part Three for the most part was a good read, but I the ending was a bit of a thud/disappointing.  In Part two I found the \\"money belt\\" fell flat and considering the imagination of the author, IT could have been better thought out.<br /><br />It was interesting how the author was able to reach such \\"madness\\".  On the whole I enjoyed the book.

0143123173|5.0|I was drawn to this series by the TV show, which I like, and discovered a series of books that I love. Creative characters, witty writing, and a great sense of place and pace all add up to a classic modern Western. Even the most minor characters and mundane situations are crafted into engaging slices of life that flesh out the core parts of the plot.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|The Grey, 2011 film<br /><br />A man is hired by an oil company to work in an isolated location in the arctic. [The changing scenes are a distraction; this is a movie not a puzzle.] His job is to kill wolves near the settlement to protect the workers. [What attracts them?] Men board an airplane to leave for vacation (or rotation). Alwin wants quiet; he remembers his past. There is turbulence from a storm. There is noise before the crash. Alwin awakes in the snow and finds the crashed plane. There are survivors, some are wounded and die. [What is the point to this scene?] Another man laughs. Seven are left. They must start a fire, then walk south. They won't be easily found. [The language may be realistic but is overdone.] A wolf shows up to scavenge the dead. [Should they leave the crash site?] One man bleeds from a wolf bite. Is that wolf part of a pack? They might attack if they have a den nearby.<br /><br />There is conflict among the men. [The darkness detracts from story.] The men joke over their situation. More wolves show up. They keep a fire going. A wolf attacks but is driven off. Daylight reveals dead bodies. They decide to head for the trees. They collect wallets for the families. The talk tells about their characters. Alwin searches the wreckage. \\"God bless these men.\\" Wolves attack a straggler; he bleeds out. Dusk brings the wolves. \\"They're all around us!\\" A fire is lit just in time. \\"It worked.\\" Alwin has a way to use a shotgun shell against a wolf. \\"I'm not scared.\\" They hear the growl of a wolf. Then a wolf attacks! The men kill it, then hear the howls from the pack. They will cook and eat it. The wolves howl again.<br /><br />They continue to move out and find a refuge. The high altitude has an effect on a man. Alwin remembers his past as a child. There is a storm with high winds. One man doesn't wake up. They are near a river and devise a way to escape down a cliff with an improvised rope. One man has a problem. They continue to walk by the river.[No compass to guide them?] One man wants to rest. Is he tired of life? The two continue to walk. Two wolves approach and the men run. One falls into the fast-flowing river and is caught. Alwin expresses his frustration then continues to walk through the trees. He pauses, then hears a growl from wolves. \\"Once more into the fray.\\" Will you be surprised by the ending? [Was this movie a too subtle story of the effect of the economic depression of workers?]<br /><br />You can blame the producer, director, screenwriter, and the author of the original short story for this movie. It is not so much bad as not good. You may be sorry you spent two hours watching this movie. I understand that if you survive a plane crash you should remain near the wreck as it is more visible from any search plane. A smoky fire is a signal for help. This could have been titled \\"Jaws in the Woods\\". It is another horror story. This production company could have used somebody to critique their plot before they implemented it. Or whatever they use to plan a production. I heard the name \\"Alwin\\" but the credits say \\"Ottway\\". They needed to carry a pistol whenever you travel in a wild country. You never know.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put this book down. I Recommend it to all readers of every age. Both of my granddaughters read this book and loved it.
0345803485|2.0|Hats off to E.L. James! She certainly found a need in the book market. Fifty Shades of Grey is reality TV in print. It's voyeuristic, fantasy, sexy fun! The book perfectly characterises the fantasy of a \\"good girl\\", coerced by a wealthy, gorgeous man, one who is enchanted by the woman and changes his uncaring, sexually demanding ways to please her and only her. The book involves enough dialogue to keep a woman's interest and the reading is easy. So easy, you can nearly drive and read this book (although that's not recommended!).

1583334386|5.0|This book is based on a course in willpower the author (Kelly McGonigal, PhD) teaches for Stanford University. McGonigal is a good writer with a very good sense of humor and her book relies on solid scientific research related to the psychology of willpower. In the beginning, she encourages the reader to come up with a \\"willpower challenge\\" or behavioral change to work on during a ten week \\"home course\\" related to the book's ten chapters (studying one chapter per week). (And, of course, one could read the book all the way through first, if they prefer.)<br /><br />Most of the chapters focus on particular psychological challenges (one per chapter) related to willpower and one's efforts to create a new habit, or change an old habit. In these chapters, she explains the psychological mechanisms at play (often related to how we sabotage ourselves) and shows how they could be overcome. Numerous tips and exercises are offered to help the reader. This forms the heart of the book and the insights offered are priceless for anyone who wants to develop more willpower and be more successful at pursuing their goals. To me, this material is worth \\"5 stars.\\"<br /><br />Thanks to this book, after reading it straight through, I have resumed a daily meditation practice and resumed doing yoga. And I look forward to other positive changes as I work with it more methodically.<br /><br />One weakness of the book relates to the \\"willpower challenge\\" the reader is instructed to come up with in the beginning. For one thing, people who need help in creating a goal and designing a plan for achieving it (with short term goals, etc), are not given such assistance. A brief description of such things could have been put in an appendix, since this assignment was to serve as a background for the \\"course\\". Furthermore, throughout the book, there should be more references to this challenge, with the reader being encouraged to reflect on his/her overall progress with it (perhaps in a \\"willpower journal\\" or \\"willpower challenge journal\\"). The challenge, and how the reader progressed with it, are not even addressed in the summary questions on the last page. (For an excellent book that has everything one needs to know for creating and achieving goals, read Succeed by social psychologist Heidi Grant Halvorson.)<br /><br />One thing I have difficulty with is the author's idea of looking at your \\"self\\" that is motivated toward positive future goals as the \\"real you\\" vs the impulsive part of you which would therefore not be the \\"real you.\\" (page 104) In my opinion, this is bad psychological advice. While certainly one wants to emphasize the part of oneself that is oriented toward positive future goals, the sort of \\"judgmental split\\" that the reader is encouraged to create could result in denying or suppressing one's \\"undesirable\\" impulsive nature, which could make it less conscious and therefore more powerful (\\"what you resist persists\\"). Paradoxically, only when one is able to open up to, and fully accept, their impulsive nature (or any other part of themselves they have resistance to), without trying to make it go away, is it likely to transform or diminish. (In another part of the book, Chapter 9, the author does encourage accepting unwanted thoughts and feelings, which is the \\"right\\" psychological approach for things you don't like about yourself.)<br /><br />I would also have liked for McGonigal to have included a bibliography (ideally an annotated one).<br /><br />In addition to this book, I read two other books related to willpower. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg gives a simple but valuable presentation of the basic mechanism behind habits. (cue that triggers a habit or routine > the routine > the reward which one learns to crave) He then shows how to use this \\"habit loop\\" to create a new habit or overcome a \\"bad\\" habit. He also gives some helpful information on willpower based on research studies. Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength is co-authored by Roy Baumeister, one of the foremost researchers on willpower, and John Tierney. This book has numerous insights on willpower and how to develop it, as well as insights and tips related to setting goals and changing habits. The authors of this book have a good sense of humor.

B005LAIGSM|4.0|As much as I LOVE Channing Tatum I had a really hard time watching this movie.  I had read the book before watching the movie and had hoped the movie would be as good as the book.  The only thing the movie had in common with the book was the fact that the couple were in a car accident and that the wife lost her memory.  Other than that the movie did not follow the book at all.  Hence the four out of five stars rating.  Tatum is just so darn good looking and I wanted to really like this movie but I couldn't.  Read the book first!!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|My husband has a theory that even the dullest of books would be interesting if you add a few zombies; I think I have found the exception to that rule.<br /><br />First off, it was horribly written!  The same 5 or 6 phrases where used over and over and over again!  Was the editor asleep?  Does no one speak like a normal person or do they all just \\"murmur\\" and \\"whisper\\" when they aren't busy biting their lip or having their \\"blood sing\\".  I usually don't criticize writing style because the story is engaging enough that I don't notice it, in this case the writing was SO bad it was distracting from the story.<br /><br />And the story line . . . never have I liked characters less.  I didn't love Edward and Bella in Twilight but at least there were Jacob and Charlie that I liked so it was okay.  Ana and Christian are both horrible and need more therapy than his billions of dollars can buy, and there are no other characters to like!  Kate is okay and so are Elliot and Taylor but they aren't developed enough to even be considered minor characters!  Of course come to think of it, neither are Ana and Christian, they are just immature idiots who use kinky sex to solve everything.  I obviously don't expect my books to be too realistic (I read a story about sparkly vampires after all) but nothing about this is even mildly relatable, not their emotions or actions or anything!<br /><br />I honestly wonder how on earth this made it to the best seller list.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because now I'm morbidly intrigued and will probably read the next two books.  It's like the old hairy guy in a speedo; it's horrible and you know it's horrible  and it hurts to look at, but for some unexplanable reason you just can't take your eyes off of it.

B004RE29PO|5.0|I own less than 5 BluRays.<br />not because I am not a fan of good media, but because I don't feel the need to own many movies, when in this age we can watch things over and over, at will.<br />This is a different matter. My all time favorite \\"scary movie\\"<br />The remastering is phenomenal, and the directors cut is the only way to watch it. Crisp, clear, and for the most part, timeless. They just don't make movies like this anymore.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|I enjoyed John Scalzi's \\"Old Man's War\\".  But where that novel took breezy unrealistic dialogue to a 6 or 7 on the dial, this one takes it to 11.  All the characters in this novel speak very forced satire, all the time, and it quickly grates.<br /><br />*mild spoilers ahead*<br /><br />This novel was highly recommended by someone I think should know better, as the \\"funniest thing I've read in a long time\\".  Even granting that humor is very subjective, this is just not that funny.  It's \\"ha ha\\" chuckle-chuckle funny here and there, but it's written like it's a novelization of a bad TV series about a bad TV series.  And yes, it is in fact about a bad TV series, but I just didn't buy it.  This is the kind of stuff I'd enjoy and maybe bookmark if I encountered it in an Internet forum by an amateur author, but it just didn't measure up to what I expected by this author.
0439023483|5.0|My choice of reading is thrillers so when my sister told me she was reading this book I told her I didn't think I would like it. I definitely didn't want to read it after seeing the movie trailer. She insisted I would like it. Long atory short. It was great. Fast paced page turner.<br /><br />After reading the book I defintiry don't want to see the movie because I'm a bit squeamish LOL  i love a good writer that can make you visualize every detail. That's a good writer.<br /><br />The whole idea of being sent to a arena to fight to the death is just a bit much but it was definitely a good read.

0143038419|1.0|I know I am a little late in reading this but after I saw an interview that said that the book sold over 6,000,000 copies, I just had to read it.  This is not the worst book I ever read - but only because I read Pure Drivel by Steve Martin (I can't imagine anyone taking the title from him).  The book starts out with the main charter suffering a breakdown because life isn't how she thought it should be.  Sure she has a great home, a faithful husband, and a successful career but some how the reader is still expected to feel sorry for this princes.  To fix her life, she dumps her husband and takes a year long vacation -- yep, that's just how the rest of us do it.  For the rest of the story, this self-indulgent, over-privlaged WASP treks around the globe meeting very mundane characters and then struggles to make them sound interesting.  The most tragic character in the book never even has a tragedy, he just ALMOST had a tragedy.<br />I would tell you to just watch the movie but I watched it as well and it was even worse than the book.
1590171993|5.0|What a satisfying read.  I had never heard of this book, nor of author John Williams, until I walked into Kramer Books in Washington, DC, one afternoon in June.  It was mentioned in a staff note about another Williams novel, so I asked one of the staff about Stoner.  I bought it on his recommendation, and now wish I had asked for a few more recommendations.  Many thanks to New York Review Books for bringing it back into print.  I have now purchased two other Williams novels.  His writing has a clarity that few authors achieve (Wallace Stegner comes to mind as one who, for me, sets the standard, along with a few others).<br /><br />On one level (the most superficial), Stoner is a novel about the joys and politics of university life.  Anyone who works at a university will recognize that some things have not changed.  But that is really just the stage or framework for the novel.  On another level it is the story of a farm-raised young man (William Stoner) who goes to the university to study agriculture, becomes absorbed in literature instead, and realizes that his true vocation is teaching.  That story itself is an interesting one.  At its most fundamental level, however, Stoner is really about basic questions of how to make a meaningful life, and how to comprehend a life.  How to encompass, in words, in thoughts, what it means to be alive, to be a human being with dreams, desires, hopes--none of them reducible to the \\"goals\\" people are told are so important, but all of them constrained and in the end possibly shattered by the indifference of time's passing?  \\"What did you expect?\\"  The thrice-repeated question at the end of the novel contains the central question of the book.  The only answer that can keep it from being a tragedy must come out of a life lived with love, integrity, dedication to an ideal, even if implacable reality makes their achievement impossible.  They live inside the person who does not lose faith in them, and in the end, they liberate.<br /><br />This may not sound like compelling reading, but I found I could hardly put the book down.  It is beautifully written, and it worked its way into my consciousness and emotions so effectively that I am surprised it is not better known.  And the best part about it is that Williams accomplishes this without pretentiousness.  The power and clarity of his writing are such that he only needs to tell the story in all of its emotional honesty, and the reader's heart and mind know what to do with it.  It is neither an action novel full of suspense, nor a ponderous piece of literary artistry that is mostly about its author showing off.  So why isn't it better known?  Maybe we don't really want novels like this.  Maybe, but I could use a few more.

Draw a picture of my soul, and it'd be a scribble with fangs, \\" says Dark Places anti-heroine; Libby Day who in 1985 helped a jury convict her 15 year-old brother Ben for the ritualistic murders of her mother and sisters. 25 years later Libby is not the picture of mental health, she drinks, steals and lives a vague life funded by donations of well wishers.  Now running short of money she agrees to help the \\"Kill Club\\", a group of true crime fanatics; re-investigate the murder of her family and possibly exonerate Ben, who has a large following of \\"groupies\\" who believe in his innocence.<br /><br />Dark Places is a psychological thriller and murder mystery with twin story-lines. We read the build up to the 1985 murders in Kansas during a time of Midwest \\"satanic panic\\" while Libby's mother battles poverty, trying to keep a roof over the heads of her children and food on the table. The reader witnesses her struggle for survival while raising her daughters and battling with an aloof Ben. The narrative is almost painful to read, knowing from the first few pages that she and her daughters are destined to be murdered and her son convicted of the crime.<br /><br />The second and even more compelling story is Libby's. The destruction of her life, her interactions with the \\"Kill Club\\", and the re-investigation of the murders to help her brother (and earn a little spare cash) when she was once so sure of his guilt. Libby Day is anti-heroine, dark and complex. She is supported by a cast of characters who we alternately love and hate. Ben Day, who we meet as a complicated and confused young man.  In his youth he was the odd young teen who you hid your child from when walking down the street, but as an adult he has amassed a cult following of females who seek to prove his innocence and release him from prison. Mother Patty's struggle is the struggle of every single mother.  Money has run out and so has her husband. She has 4 children to raise including a son she is more and more anxious about. For the reader Patty losing her family farm is an interesting history lesson about the 1980's midwest, the corporate farmer and new technology was pushing out the small farmer while men and women like Patty lost their livelihood. Runner;  the worthless ex-husband and father is a small time pot dealer who sees nothing wrong with a strong word to his family while breezing in to squander what little they have, then disappearing when expectations are placed on him.  The book expertly weaves a mystery with hints of drugs, satanism, poverty, pedophilia, and conspiracy theory. Dark Places will take the readers to their very own dark place, but it is a compelling and suspenseful emotional journey.

Not entirely sure what to expect based on highly variable reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to find this book entertaining and a real page turner. It's an easy read and although filled with some unrealistic situations (I mean who has sex THAT many times a day?), the plot is good and you easily find yourself lost in the budding and tumultuous romance between Ana and Christian. I read the entire book in less than two days and quickly purchased the other two in the series. Read it...you won't be sorry.
B004UQ03P2|5.0|Great product, really cuts down on the glare from the glossy screen on my Macbook Pro. Also keeps my screen protected well from fingerprints and scratches. The fact that its detachable and able to be cleaned and reattached makes it a great product to have for anybody who's picky about keeping their macbook in good shape to last.<br /><br />Easy To Install - like 10 seconds!<br /><br />A little pricey but if you're serious about screen protection and you're looking to cut down the glare from the glossy screen then this'll do you just fine.

030758836X|5.0|An easy read with a very interesting plot.  I did not see it coming!  This the first book I've read by this author (as I saw the book reviewed in Entertainment Weekly and figured,  \\"what the heck?\\" ) and I'm now going back to check out her other books.  This one kept my interest throughout, and there were many times when I just couldn't put it down.  Great book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy playing Spider solitaire alot. It relaxes me after a day at work or before I go to bed at nite.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|First off, I want to say that I enjoyed Daniel Radcliffe in this movie. I don't think anyone could have done a better job with the script he had to work with. I like watching serious movies, and he played this troubled character well, without overdoing it.  However, the movie moves too slowly in the beginning and waits too long to provide some necessary explanations. Also, some of the special effects are too mechanical--cheap maybe?<br /><br />I didn't read the book, but the idea in this movie of what the woman in black is doing and why, and the way Radcliffe's character seeks to appease her made for a good story-line. While the ending could be called satisfying by some, I don't understand why the story ended that way.

B007Q1VUFA|5.0|It's great when an artist steps outside his comfort zone, and explores new territory..... successfully.  Ive been a fan of Chris Robinson and Black Crowes since the beginning.  Their last album ('Before The Frost') was a brillant culmination of the various influences that have shaped them; country, blues, heavy rock, americana, and was a solid collection of songs indeed.  \\"Big Moon Ritual\\" is yet another shade in Chris Robinson's colorful music pallette.<br /><br />This album flows with such ease and grace, and is a joy to listen to; also brillantly recorded.  It is hippie jam band music of the highest order.  It's refreshing to hear musicians playing in such harmony, truely a musical brotherhood.  Unlike some of the jam bands that beat you over the head with their unrelenting chops and virtuosity, CRB just lets the songs unfold in an organic natural way, revealing that under these jammy sounding tunes is some really fine songwriting.  It's also great to hear the return of the mighty moog synthesizer as a lead instrument, especially in the expertly capable hand of Adam McDougall.  On Side 3, I thought Steve Winwood had joined the party.  The guitar leads throughout this record are spectacular in a sweet Jerry kind of way, and always seem to be in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Chris Robinson provides some of the sweetest, most beautiful melodies of his career, proving again he's a clever wordsmith as well.  In the gorgeous \\"Reflections of Broken Mirror\\"......'my baby loves me like an autoharp.  she plucks my mind and strums my heart'.  Every song on this album is excellent, but \\"Rosalee\\" and \\"100 Days of Rain\\" are absolute classics that should stand alongside other hippe standards like the Deads' \\"Truckin\\".  I have enjoyed this record and played it the most of any record Ive bought so far this year.<br /><br />The vinyl is a very nice pressing; two 180 gram discs with the very cool Silver Arrow labels.  It also comes with a download.  The album artwork is a Roger Dean like moonscape or desert, very cool, as well.  While the pressing and mastering on this record are excellent, again mishandling at the record plant has resulted in unnecesary scratches resulting in surface noise in a few spots.  The harsh, paper inner sleeves doesn't help in that department.  Some of the better vinyls Ive bought recently came with the soft poly-lined sleeves.  Vinyl makers should include these with all new records, or at least stress to the people working in the plants to take a little care with these prescious black platters us music freaks love and pay so much for.<br /><br />As far as \\"Big Moon Ritual\\" goes, the vinyl is worth getting, (even if you hear a few stray pops). It really brings out the sweet organic warm vibe of this wonderful record!
0670921076|5.0|This book not only tells a compelling story but presents Beijing as it was during the last days of Colonial strengths just months before the Japanese invasion.  As a history it is dead on, as a mystery it is wonderful.  I totally recommend this book.
0439023513|5.0|i loved the story and cried at the end with joy at the ending and was so into the book that i couldn't wait to be able to get back to the book and hated for it to end.
B000056NX5|5.0|As a fan of JCS, I have both versions and several soundtracks. I saw this version live, before I got the movie. I was fascinated and surprised, since I didn't know I was seeing a different version when I bought the tickets. I was a bit stunned throughout the show, but pleasantly surprised by the time it was over.<br /><br />It took some time and research to figure out what I had just seen, and then I tracked down the video that coincided with it. Apparently, this \\"version\\" is similar in performance to \\"Joseph and The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\\" I say this because the premise is always the same, but the interpretation is left to the director and/or producer, so every time you see it, it's different.<br /><br />What I saw on stage wasn't exactly what I saw in the movie (the movie was MUCH better), but anything that has the music that I can sing along to is suitable for me.<br /><br />Just thought I'd counteract the Pro's and Con's, although the review was very well written and very concise. You used a lot of details that I would have had to look up; I'm just voicing my opinion.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I offended you, that was not my intention at all.

B0059XTTW8|5.0|This is the remade version of LeCarre's Tinker Tailor, two hours rather than six, remade as a history piece rather than a current piece, as was the Alec Guinness version. And that's the big difference. For Guinness and the BBC, they were able to film real time, in a world that existed as they filmed. The wall now is gone, Berlin is the capital of a united Germany, Citroen DS's and Austin/Morris 1300's are no longer found on every corner, and the KGB isn't there to frighten little children any more. I watched the tv Tinker Tailor, and Smiley's People when they came out: they were of their time then, and this one is of our time now.
0891419063|5.0|How anyone can rate this below 5 stars is beyond me. Sledge's captivating account of his time in the Pacific takes the reader to the front lines of battle. This book is as real as gets without having been in combat, and Sledge's delivery is flawless. The fortitude and tenacity these soldiers showed in the face of the atrocities of war is astonishing. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, first hand account of WW2 I have come across. \\"God Isn't Here,\\" by Richard E. Overton is also an excellent read if you enjoyed this one.
0345803485|1.0|I kept reading this book, waiting for something-anything that would confirm its place on the best seller list. I was sadly disappointed. Not only is the writing amateurish, there is no substance to the unbelievable story. The characters ( in particular the protagonist) are not developed in any way, so that one cannot visualize what they even look like! I got to the point where I was skipping over the plethora of sex scenes,to try and find some semblance of a plot/story.<br />I will definitely not waste my money on the next two books in the trilogy.<br />What a waste of time!

B0079XPUOW|3.0|Best prologue I've read in ages and ages - absolutely brilliant, if, as was the case for me, you enter it knowing nothing about the subject matter of the book. I'm planning to read that bit to my brother, over the phone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the entire books is a one-trick pony, all revolving tightly around a single, underlying idea and while it's mined expertly and exhaustively by Mr. Scalzi, all too often, it comes close to the edge of becoming boring.<br /><br />In particular, the book would have been better without the three codas, even if each had a little gem or two. I particularly wish I hadn't read the first coda, because the first half of that interlude is really mundane writing.<br /><br />A very pleasant read, that I finished very quickly, but not as satisfying as the four other Scalzi novels I've read.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Disclosure: I'm one of those Rush fans that has enjoyed all of their albums, even the lighter, almost jazz-like offerings. I've enjoyed dropping the needle on each new album wondering what it would sound like.<br /><br />That said, most of us long-time Rush fans became fans around (if not exactly) \\"2112.\\" Those earlier albums defined the \\"Rush sound\\" that polarized music fans. For those of us who loved it, we fell hard. We ate up \\"Farwell to Kings\\", \\"Permanent Waves\\", \\"2112\\", and even \\"Caress of Steel\\" (which polarizes even Rush fans).<br /><br />\\"Clockwork Angel\\" is a return to those earlier albums. This album flat out rocks! If fact, most of these tracks would not be out of place in the Thrash Metal category. For me, it belongs square in the classic \\"Rush Sound\\" Prog-Rock category.<br /><br />Grade: A

B00068TJM6|5.0|I've had this watch for over 5 years, hardly ever take it off. It's my third Seiko chronograph in 40 years, and I expect it will last as long as the others did, and I don't go lightly on them. The mineral crystal is slightly domed instead of flat like my previous Seiko's, and as a result of wearing the watch while working on my car, doing carpentry and other rough manual tasks, the crystal has been scratched pretty badly in the middle. It's not a complaint, just an observation. If I had any complaints, it would be battery life. I go through a battery in about a year and a half. It also has to be set manually for date when it goes from a 30 day month. My last Seiko chronograph would get about twice the battery life, and automatically jumped the 31st day on a 30 day month. It's a tough watch, takes everything I dish out; never a problem with the band, the clasp is as secure as a padlock. I get lots of complements on the looks of the watch, and would recommend it to anyone as an outstanding value.

B000MPEIF6|3.0|When I first heard that they were going to make a movie based of of one of my favorite video game franchises of all time I couldn't even begin to tell you the level of excitement I felt. I began climbing the walls with impatience and counting down the days until the films release. However after I viewed the movie I felt something completely different. Confusion and dissapointment, I couldn't believe that the film makers actually had the audacity to call this 'Resident Evil'. This movie goes against everything from the first resident evil game, and even finds new ways to annoy avid fans of the once great series of resident evil games.<br /><br />Instead of this movie following the Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. team an a mansion located in the Arklay mountains we instead follow a Spec Ops team hired by or created by Umbrella (I wonder why they don't just use the U.B.C.S.) a security operative, and environmentalist, and an Umbrella employee. So we are off to a pretty sad spot to begin with. This film feature zero, that is right, ZERO characters from the first resident evil game and doesn't even come close to even getting the basic premise correct. Instead of this taking place in a mansion, we are in an underground lab, instead of Jill or any other cool resident evil characters we get these, somewhat interesting, set of characters, we only get to see two B.O.W.s, and I really can't believe they did this but, they had the nerve to change the way the virus spread to Raccoon City. In the game William Burkin had just finished his work on the G-Virus when Umbrella sent mercenaries to retrieve the sample from him, morally wounding him in the process. With William's last breath he injects the g-virus into his system and attacks the mercs and destroys all viles of the g and t-virus. Some sewer rats start drinking and gnawing on the capsules and then spread the virus throughout the city. In this movie the idiot scientist decide \\"hey lets jut re-open the lab that we know is filled with dangerous monsters and walkers so we can find out what happened instead of downloading the security footage from a secure location.\\" Surprise surprise the virus runs rampant throughout the city.<br /><br />Now if the writers actually played the game, or even cared about the fans they wouldn't have had the movie end that way, but I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />As we journey throughout the new location (that being the underground lab) we get some really interesting scenery as we get to see locations of manufactured B.O.W.s' and even locations where they tested the T-virus and designed it. I was actually curious about where this road was taking us in terms of story, so as the Special Ops team is sent in to deactivate the lab's A.I. system they have to cut the power, which releases all of the walkers that were contained in the offices and testing room, and the group is forced to do battle. Here is where the movie actually becomes pretty interesting, sure this movie is a stab in the back to all fans of the games, however, there are still some entertaining moments of the film and this is certainly one of them. The group begin fighting the undead but are curious as to why they keep getting up no matter how many times they are shot in the torso.<br /><br />*Me personally, if I shot an attacker 7 times in the chest and they just shrug it off I'm going to aim for the head. To bad these characters would rather waste ammo than use their brains.<br /><br />Our survivors are then forced to fall back, but due to heavy zombie presence, are separated as the writers thankfully bring some parts of the resident evil games into this movie. What I mean by that is we get a licker, who shows up at the end of the movie, and zombie dogs. This is where I was very excited to see how authentic these B.O.W.'s would be, and they are very authentic and in fact very scary to see in a live action film.<br /><br />Alice wonders into a dog kennel and when I was watching this for the first time I said to myself \\"Oh please, please don't be a tease\\" and this anything but. It is here that we get an immensely satisfying battle between Alice and the zombie dogs as she takes on the entire kennel and even kills that last one with a pretty cool air kick to the face.<br /><br />Alice manages to regroup with Matthew and the others as they try and find a way out of the facility before they become trapped and left to die. They discover a way out through the maintenance tunnels only to get swarmed by walkers. They just barely make it out alive, but two of the remaining spec ops team members (Rain and Kaplan suffer bites and are now both infected) This is even worse for Rain as she was bitten earlier in the movie and now the infection is spreading even faster now. As they attempt to escape their current predicament one of the pipes breaks causing Kaplan to fall the zombie bit below, he survives his encounter and tells the group to leave him behind as they don't have nearly enough ammunition to kill the walkers and he is too far away for there to be any probable rescue. He unloads his revolver and realizes that he only has one bullet left, which he uses to dispose of a walker before crawling away.<br /><br />It is here that the remaining members of the group (Alice,Matthew,Spence, and a very much infected Rain) journey through the labs where the virus was being tested and manufactured, it is also here that Alice remembers exactly where the cure was located as well. When they arrive to this location she discovers the cure to be missing and we find out who is responsible (it is Spence big surprise there) as he locks the group in the room after he receives a bite from a walker. He makes his way to the train where he had the cure and virus the entire time, only to die from a very hungry licker.<br /><br />*I was very excited to finally see this thing actually have some significance in the movie, for the most part it just wonders around the facility teasing the fans with its presence. Though I suppose they were ultimately building up suspense for the creatures inevitable battle with the few remaining survivors.<br /><br />Kaplan rejoins the group as they make their way to the train, retrieve the cure and begin administering it to the infected members of the group (Rain and Kaplan).Only to have their happy moment interrupted by a still very hungry licker. Now we get, what I have to admit is a pretty cool battle. There is almost no stopping this beast, Alice even takes Rains .45 pistol and shoots three rounds point blank into its face and all that does is piss it off. But I have to complain about this part as well. In resident evil 2 you can discover a file that describes just how dangerous this monster is. The file says how its tongue cut a man apart, yet Alice gets hit right in the face with it and all that happens is she falls on her back.<br /><br />After defeating this monster the only survivors are Alice and Matthew, they make their way up to the mansion and are greeted by Umbrella scientists. Alice and Matthew are again separated and Alice regains consciousness in a hospital. She discovers that the city has been overrun and her battle is far from over.<br /><br />My god this movie was disappointing, there is almost nothing recognizable about this movie. I find it highly insulting to even call this a 'resident evil'movie when so much is changed. They changed the story,characters,location, virtually everything is different. With all that has been aid I have to confess that I actually kind of like this movie. I know how it sounds but it is actually enjoyable, even with all of the flaws.

B0073PPKNM|5.0|In the past two years or so, Melody Gardot has toured the world, in search of inspiration for this, her third magnificent album.  That might explain the title of this album, \\"The Absence.\\"  But I think the title is about something else:<br /><br />In last year's \\"Sophisticated Ladies,\\" Charlie Haden and Quartet West's incredibly romantic album, Charlie et al set forth about 6 1940's songs of love for the top female jazz singers in the world.  And leading off the set was the most romantic song from the most romantic singer of them all:  \\"If I'm Lucky,\\" sung by Melody Gardot.  In 4 years, imo Melody Gardot has distinguished herself as the most romantic American singer of all.<br /><br />And this album confirms it.  \\"The absence\\" is a phrase from the album's highlight, \\"Lisboa\\" (track 5), as in \\"the absence of pain.\\"  Bliss.  Pure bliss.  Listen to \\"Lisboa,\\" or \\"Se Voce me Ama,\\" (track 9) Melody's two duets with producer Heitor Pereira.  Watch the video of \\"Mira\\" (track 1) on You Tube.  How can you miss it?  How can you not feel it?  The smoldering, eye-locked glances of two lovers.  Children running and dancing on the beach.  The dizzying, illogical feeling of infatuation.  The warmth of the sunset on a clear summer day. The longing of a too-long absence.  The craziness right after a breakup.  The soft caresses.  The afterglow after making love.  It's all there, and then some.  This album is simply visceral.<br /><br />Apparently, a number of you in Ammyland do not agree.  And I will grant you a few quibbles. The sound gap in \\"Iemanja\\" is the most disquieting gap since Rose Mary Woods' 7-minute gap on the Watergate tapes.  \\"Iemanja\\" (track 11) sounds suspiciously like \\"Brazil\\" in some of its changes.  I don't find the big sweeps of orchestra off-putting, but I can see how some might.  Others have mentioned the clicking sound in track 3, \\"So Long,\\" though that doesn't bother me, any more than the woman shouting, \\"All of you!  Sing It With Me!  Okay?\\" in \\"Lisboa.\\"  (whatever you want to say about \\"Lisboa,\\" it is most definitely not a \\"sing-along\\"!)<br /><br />And ultimately,  I say:  So what?  This album reeks, drips, flows from love.  It is about love, pure love.  How can you \\"dis\\" love?<br /><br />This c.d. absolutely deserves a Grammy nomination.  There isn't another American album quite like it.  Normally I wouldn't predict that, as the NARA usually isn't too kind to third-world vocal jazz.  But the most romantic American singer on Verve?  I think it could happen.  RC<br /><br />12/24/12 - But it didn't.  4 star review in Down Beat, but no nomination.  Oh, well.  Someday, the NARA will catch on....RCtever you want to say about \\"Lisboa,\\" it is most definitely not a \\"sing-along\\"!)<br /><br />And ultimately,  I say:  So what?

B0074JOCIG|5.0|Most excellent DVD.  Each band member is outstanding, but Joe steals the show.  Guitar playing like I have never seen or heard before.  His voice is the icing on the cake.  I'd give it more than 5 stars, if possible. Play it loud and play it again.  He's the best!
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|What's great about it: True to life<br />What's not so great: Limited backstory<br /><br />Heretofore I've caught my share of small land locked salmon and trout in my neighborhood lake that was used for the setting of the opening Whale Hunt scene transformed into the Beaufort Sea. I was amazed to see in the movie though that we now have (or had) a whale in our lake through the magic of CGI (computer graphic imaging.) lol<br /><br />As to the movie itself, I couldn't believe all the scenes that ended up getting cut including some that were in the trailer. At least our neighborhood Jewel Lake and the whaling boat with its crew on the lake were prominently shown in the opening scenes of the movie. (Drew's performance on the lake/arctic sea as part of the back story though didn't make it.)<br /><br />It looks like they chopped other parts of her back story since in the promo shots they had her wearing yellow rain gear and holding a bucket which suggested they had planned to include the episode in Tom Rose's book describing the actual Greenpeace girl's efforts to save a Beluga Whale here near Anchorage by dousing it with water when it got stuck on the mudflats. (In that real life event she was almost drowned and her boyfriend ended up saving her life. True to her character as depicted in the movie, she had insisted to her boyfriend that her dog be saved first.)<br /><br />One cool thing that I was hoping might make it into the movie, and which apparently did, were some of the really neat sunsets that we had during the filming on the ice field set. When I watched those sunsets from my office window I was curious if the cameraman filming below me might try to include some. You can see one such spectacular sunset caught by the cinematographer just as the story fades from the whaling captains' meeting to the ice field set with its animatronic whale surfacing from the ice hole below.<br /><br />By way of review, I thought the character playing Malik, Nathan's grandfather, puton a masterful performance worthy of a supporting actor Academy nomination. To me the funniest scene in the movie was where Malik shut up the rambling Ted Danson's character by instructing the gathered Inupiats to start cheering. Although he is a well known Alaska Native performer here, this was his first movie role. The acting overall was quite good although some additional character development would have been welcome - obviously hard to do with the large cast and varied story lines that would have required adding more time than the editors were evidently allocated.<br /><br />Another piece of movie making trivia, dozens of period (1988) cars were used to circle the block during the Anchorage Greenpeace Office scene toward the end of the movie. Only a single red Pontiac survived the cutting room table as it alone was visible through the window as Drew Barrymore and John Krasinski reunited inside the office. As a point of interest, the movie makers went to great lengths to make this a true period piece from costuming to cars as noted above.<br /><br />Not to be missed in the DVD and Blu-ray are the extra features which are most interesting in depicting how the movie was made here in Alaska and the true-to-life happenings that were incorporated into the film.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you have made it through the first and second book...this one is even better.  I can't wait to see what else the author has in store for her future books!  She is an amazing writer.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|another great game from G5! Large variety of challenges, great graphics and game play! Would recommend any of their games!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you can make it through the \\"freakiness\\" of the first book, you will LOVE the second and third.  I'll be honest, I almost stopped reading after the 4th chapter...I was thinking to myself \\"what the crap!!\\"...but if you can skip past the parts you don't like and get to the amazing story, you will love these books.  The author is new and I have to say she is a great writer.  These books catch you and draw you in.  Its very hard to put these books down.  I read the bad reviews and I'm glad I gave them a chance.  You won't be disappointed!  Form your own opinion!!!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very entertaining ...but too hard to get the acorns.  The animals are cute. You should be able to finish the game without having your child purchase the acorns.  The scrat game you play to get acorns.....does not let you play for free a lot.  There shouldbemore ways to win free acorns since some of the items need to be purchased with acorns.

I'm on with the third and final book now and I'm finding it riveting.  The only thing I have against the series is all the product placement - can't remember off the top of my head but brands of notebooks, etc.
0156907399|1.0|I chose to read this book after reading several recommendations about how it is a model for how to write & construct fiction. Au contraire, this is quite simply the worst book I have EVER read. Turgid, boring, meaningless, confusing, tedious, pointless. I want a refund on the time in my life I spent toiling through this mess.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I bought this for my son's birthday. We received it promptly, however the controller has \\"dead spots\\" in it. My son did not like the controller at all so we returned it. We did receive our refund very fast.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It's a good game in Sim City mode but the Kindle Fire version doesn't have the new update 1.02 which makes makes major improvements to the game especially for those near or at level 50.  New tasks. It looks like you can go to level 60 at least (Scants Village with the update goes from 50 to 60).  More space to build and expand village.  It looks like its almost double the Borg space.  New thing and animals to add to your village.  It is also a little easier to get acorns that you need when you get to 50.  THE UPDATE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE IN ANDROID MARKET FOR OVER A WEEK.
0670023329|5.0|as a chinese native speaker, this is the very first english book i ever finished. i have to say it is an incredible experience to read the book, especially connecting it with my family's own history.<br /><br />i come from northeastern china. roughly the area where Shin fled into after his escape from north korea. and my grandfather was belonging to one of the first groups of soldiers to enter korea peninsular in 1950 secretly, even before the war officially started. he told me they pretended to be local koreans with wearing farmers' clothes. That year, my grandfather was 20 and served as a junior officer for 4 years in General Lin Biao's troop, which just finished fighting with Chiang Kai-shek's army one year before.<br /><br />i asked him many times, how it was during the war? what happened? he NEVER answered my questions directly but always gave me some vague words. all the things i knew from him are:<br /><br />1. he was there when chinese army took seoul in 1951, so he was the first one in the family who has been to south korea, next one is i myself, in 2003.<br /><br />2. because he is smart and educated, in later 1951, he is chosen as one of the two officers in his battalion to come back to china entering some higher military educational program, which made him to become an explosion engineer officer for the rest 30+ years of his military service.<br /><br />3. the rest in his battalion are almost all killed, in the hard battle afterwards, from 1951 to 1953. if he was there, he will die, and i will never be born.<br /><br />4. he always said, when he was in korea, in the cruel war, nothing big happened, nothing serious, he did not see much, did not hear much, that's it. if you asked for more, he will go to sleep or watch tv...<br /><br />5. he is one of the most honest and nice persons i ever knew. everyone in the family loves him.<br /><br />i don't know why i said these, i think i might just miss my grandfather. with all the things i read from the book, i cannot tell myself that what my grandfather did 60 years back has nothing related to Shin's life. actually it did, right? but for us, for this side of the story, it was long back and most of the stories are forgotten. dead are buried, memories are fading, the world is moving forward.<br /><br />but on that side, someone is still suffering from what happened 60 years back. this has to be changed without any excuse.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app runs great on my kindle fire and also on my iphone. I love how on my kindle it gives me a reminder. I would reccomend this app to anyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|i enjoyed the book and understand the idea of the complexity of relationships.  it was odd how it abruptly ended but it left me thinkimg about how we hate and love those around us and stay for what we get even when we think things are a mess. the book shows the reality of relationships. it might seem unrealistic but it is not.  stranger scenarios happen all around the world
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is a good game. keeps you interested and entertained. I am having a hard time getting to level 11 but other then that its good.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|The insulation crumbled off the cord leaving the wires fully exposed.  I can't help but think a fire could have started if it was touching something flamable.
B0085776BG|3.0|The story line is fine, but the acting and representation was a bit too Hollywood and hokey for me.  I am aware that a lot of factual information was trying to be crammed into one movie, but the mediocre acting left me disappointed at the end of the film.  The true characters were definitely heroes of WWII, but the way they were portrayed in this film had way too much Hollywood glitz added in.  Very disappointed in how these true heroes were represented.  I think most of them would have been grounded had they truly behaved like the \\"hot dogs\\" they were displayed as in this film.  Bottom line: I would recommend NOT buying and save your $$ for more of a documentary-type film.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana Del Rey has a great voice with a quirky musical style. Some of her songs sound like catchy pop songs colliding with the deep depression of Morrisey or the angst of Garbage. It sounds ironic and indeed there are a lot of in-congruence between the music and the lyrics. Somehow, though, it works wonderfully. A very different sound that I've heard before but it's great. Bought the album on a whim. I didn't like it at first because it's unexpectedly dark and creepy but it's really growing on me.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|If you love her music because she is one of the best singers you've ever heard, you'll love this album.  I think this album is great.  It's like listening to a modern day Off-Broadway show.  Very dramatic and compelling.  Flows from beginning to end.  As you can tell from some prior reviews, this is not meant for the easy to please crowd (and they have the nerve to say Fiona's unstable?, check out some of these one star reviews...phew). This album is perfect for people who like to hear an artist evolve.
0143105566|5.0|Although this is a spy story and a political thriller, each character in this novel leads very quiet life and is lonely. There was a leak of political  information and a murder occured. These events changed the life of Castle, the main character, who has been living quietly and carefully. Through Castle's state of mind, the readers can understand his imminent danger.<br /><br />  I've read this novel three times. Each time after reading it, I always feel a kind of discouragement, because in this story some 'clever' and 'mechanical' bureaucrats control the situation, and they lead Castle and the people close to him to tragedy. The bureaucrats don't regret anything. I think that it's very likely to happen in our real society.<br /><br />This is a little discouraging but a good realistic novel.
B0000027F8|5.0|I got this CD by accident when it was mailed to me as part of the previous resident's \\"RECORD CLUB\\" contract.  I'm an arch criminal for not returning it, I know.  Suffice it to say that I was not a fan of George Michael prior to the arrival of this great little postal accident, but the title intrigued me, and I did as instructed.  I've probably bought this as a CD or a digital download 5 times throughout my life...great album.  Anyway, I was updating my musical library on the computer tonight, and I got curious as to what others thought of this album.  Glad I'm not alone.
B007SGM084|1.0|After hearing friends rave about this set of books, I downloaded the trilogy.  They had given me an idea of what the books were about.  I am a voracious reader who enjoys many genres, and am open to new things.  I was horribly disappointed in the 50 Shades series.  Most of the writing sounded as if it came from an immature high schooler's diary.  I was subjected to the same descriptions and phrases over and over again.  The storyline is barely there, which is a shame because the character of Christian had so much to offer.  Granted, the sex scenes are steamy, but even they became redundant.  As punishment to myself for buying the bundle, I made myself read to the bitter end.  By that time, I was ready to beat both Christian and Anastasia severely, but they would have loved that.  Next time, I will wait for the hype to die down on the next \\"best read ever\\" and buy my copy at a yard sale for a quarter.
0307951529|1.0|After getting somewhat excited about this book, I was hghly dissappointed. I skimmed through it all in one night. Is far too general and fluffy, and needed much more detail. Most of the info seems like a rehash of other authors material, or is  available elsewhere online for free on various blog sites. The Four Hour Work Week was much better value and much more helpful and practical. A teenager knowing nothing about entrepreneurship might enjoy this book, but otherwise, dont waste your money.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Great app that is not terrifically challenging for adults, but is a great time nonetheless. Bautiful graphics, cool storyline and well worth the price.<br /><br />,
B005HS00V4|5.0|Should I be embarrassed that this type of artistry is possible and I had no idea OR simply just be amazed by how perfect every aspect of this PERFORMANCE is?<br /><br />This is the type of performance is only possible when everyone from the lights to the post production graphics knows how to bring everything together as a whole. What struck me to write now (while watching AGAIN) is how enthralling it is! This has to be watched without jumping around or distraction to really appreciate the subtle interplay between live action and post production done so perfectly that even the astute eye could miss it. Gabriel even knows this and thanks the production people. This isn't a review about them/that but rather my attempt to rectify the synergy in how every beat, emotion, graphic and interlude is just done RIGHT. A must experience
B007R3BFR0|5.0|Fresh off the success of Nirvana's major label debut \\"Nevermind\\", producer Butch Vig decided to start a band. He got a couple of old bandmates Duke Erikson and Steve Marker and rounded out the quartet with Scottish singer Shirley Manson. He decided to christen the band Garbage- which he named after he asked a friend upon hearing the group's sound. It was an unusual mash-up of rock and roll guitars, Nine Inch Nails and Ministry-like industrial sounds over hip hop drums. They released their self titled debut in 1995- spawning the hits \\"Queer\\", \\"Stupid Girl\\" and \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\". A few years passed on when they released the aptly-titled follow-up \\"Version 2.0\\"- which narrowly missed the sophomore slump by way of the pop single \\"Special\\". In 2001, they released their most ambitious record- as well as their most misunderstood recording to date \\"Beautifulgarbage\\". By the time they released their fourth album- the straight ahead rock record \\"Bleed Like Me\\"- they were having a little trouble within the band. So they decided to go on hiatus- one that would last five years. By the time they reconnected in 2010, they started writing and recording for a new album.<br /><br />In 2012, they released their first album in seven years, \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\". It's their newest recording on their own label Stun Volume Recordings after a long association with major label Interscope Records. On this new project, it's pretty much business as usual for the quartet- as they pick up where they left off. Sonically, it sounds like their first two albums- something one would expect from Garbage. They open the album with the synth heavy uptempo \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\", a song about Shirley refusing to fall for a man's long web of deceit. She gets optimistic about love on \\"Big Bright World\\" and refuses to listen to rumors about her love life on \\"Blood For Poppies\\". On their new album, they thrown in a handful of ballads sprinkled about- including the title track \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" where they ridicule persons with fake personalities. Shirley is her typical cynical self on \\"I Hate Love\\" as well as on the drinking themed \\"Battle In Me\\". While the regular release has eleven songs, the deluxe edition as well as the vinyl version both have fifteen tracks. They round out the album with the four songs- the techno inspired songs \\"The One\\" and \\"What Girls Of Made Of\\" as well as the ballad \\"Bright Tonight\\"  and the album closer \\"Show Me\\". Overall, Garbage's \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" is a return to form for the band. They may have been away, but not much has changed for them- and that's a good thing.Of People\\" where they ridicule persons with fake personalities.

B003XKPPOU|4.0|Movie arrived quickly and in good condition as most amazon products do. The movie itself has darker and more scary content than the other toy story movies with a particularly intense scene where the toys think they are going to be incinerated. Still has the great mix of kid and adult humor of the other movies and have only watched in blu-ray so far but plan to use digital copy too. Several good special features/shorts
B003DBOS7Y|2.0|Having read Nicholas Sparks previously, I knew that this would be a story to pull at the heart strings.  However, I was just convinced that Allie and Noah had fallen in love - their characters seem to be \\"one-note\\".  Ryan G. had a stupid look on his face most of the time, and Rachel M. did that funny high pitched laugh most of the time.  And the ending was just too contrived.  I did think that the visuals in this moving were stunning - that was the real star here!
B000007ODY|3.0|I guess you get what you pay for....but, there are other recordings of Brahms by Karajan and the BPO, which I assume are better.  This one has several flaws; first of all the tempi, especially in # 1 and #3, sound as though they have a deadline in the studio and must beat the clock; Brahms notorious (and unwarranted) thick, muddy orchestration is highlighted in these recordings (the orchestra or the recording engineers??) nevertheless, finally, it would have been helpful to have some samples of these recordings on Utube to preview.  There may be, I just didn't check in time.
0060557818|5.0|This book was very enjoyable. It almost seems as if I had heard the story before there are things that seem oddly familiar about it. I think that's because there are similar characters and similar stories out there. What makes this stand out is the subtle humor involved. Great storytelling, I loved the writing style and the characters. The Marquis de Carabas was an especially well crafted character.

B000NA22C6|5.0|I have to say with a film based on Stephen King writing and starring Johnny Depp and with a title like \\"Secret window\\" I was ready for a spooky Alice in Wonderland. What I got was a lesson in stress control and problem management.  I will defiantly keep this film in mind if I ever find myself in a similar situation.<br /><br />Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is a writer going through a divorce. He retreats to his cabin in the back woods to gather his thoughts and write his next book.  There he is confronted by a clearly deranged visitor, John Shooter (John Turturro) who accuses Mort of plagiarizing; if Mort does not confess then John will get him and his little dog too.<br /><br />How will Mort handle this? Will he get Shooter before getting shot? Will his diverse be settled in an amicable way?<br /><br />One thing I found in common with Mort is I also like corn however I prefer it raw.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere, the audible book, propelled me through the world that exists just out of our reach.  One we share everyday space with, yet seem to readily pass by.  This world, composed of necessarily (and I mean this in a good way) stereotypical characters, creates the rule by which we are to follow and understand the \\"London Below\\" world.  The seeming predictability of a characters behavior is that for a purpose - things \\"have to be\\" that way.  This story captivated me until I finished listening to it twelve hours later.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Strangeland is another triumph for Keane, with catchy melodies and stirring arrangements that put it on equal footing with Hopes & Fears and Iron Sea, and without the experimental side-steps that keep Perfect Symmetry and Night Train from attaining the same level. In fact it might be my second favorite Keane album next to Hopes & Fears. By all means go for the deluxe version, as all four selections are strong.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Ok, yes it's an \\"elite\\" \\"eroctica/trashy\\" novel that you know your older sister would read with the flashlight underneath the blanket when it was lights out at camp however, I do find this book to be quite interesting. It's not about the sex and the million times the characters mutter the same words - at least, not for me. I find myself looking into the deeper meaning of the book. (What meaning you ask?)<br /><br />I find that both characters Grey and Steele have many other issues that I think most people have gone through before. Not entirely experienced in the same way as the book outlines them but things that many can perhaps identify with. Steele seems to me to be just as human as many of us - she feels a need to be loved and cherished by this seemingly impossibly man so she lets him abuse her (to her liking in some cases) and when he has crossed the line, she steps up to strike back. She tests him and goes batty with her emotional turmoil and wants to question her own inner uncertainty when it comes to the relationship. I like that she has her inner goddess cheering for her as it symbolizes her inner sexuality coming alive but not entirely dominating her, which I found that I let that happen to me in the past. It took a minute to get that \\"diva\\" under control. I felt that I could identify with her self-esteem issues, beautiful/intelligent yet thinking she's a clutz and blah blah blah - I still have some of those struggles inside my head even now that I'm almost 40.<br /><br />I like to think that Steele is not addicted to the sex but to the lines of self acceptance that Grey taunts her with, the gifts - not for the $ but for the way that they(he) makes her feel about deserving them. Grey on the other hand sounds like a manic depressant - overachiever, needs everyone to answer to him,to his ego etc.. I feel that from what I've read, he definitely enjoys the mental challenges that she's putting him through - she tests him, defies him, questions his every move, does things that are unexpected. In my family, the last woman that someone met like that, my brother married her saying she was such a rare gem! It sounds to me like a good game of classic cat and mouse but what keeps me interested is who is the mouse and who is the cat. Each time I think I've got that figured out, some other emotional distress calls the other character out.<br /><br />I suppose I can identify so much with the feelings in the book/character development since I'm always thinking about people around me that fit these same descriptions. I mean who can say they've never had a Jose or Kate in their life? The deeper meanings are much more interesting to me..oh and the erotica part is \\"ok\\". If you can read between the lines and see the \\"other story\\" behind the erotica, I think you'll like it! I certainly hope that as I read the rest of the novels that Steele remains just that - strong as steel...es things that are unexpected.

Seeing this movie for the second time, I was moved even more. I remember the first time I watched it... to me it was everything. It still is. The Love that they have, is so real...so real...<br />I recommend watching this movie to anyone. I do not want to spoil anything about it. Just know that they are brothers, but Love is so powerful that there is no \\"boundary\\" to it. Watching the movie, you will begin to realize that as humans, we are Beautiful and Complex in nature.<br />This movie has captured the hearts of all who watch it. This movie is controversial, but it is loved more by all who desire the companionship...the relationship.... the Love that they have... so Real.
B004XUMN6W|5.0|Well acted, well written, and with plenty of action this is one hell of an episode. The other customer reviewer does not understand what he/she is saying.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />This is a sad and tragic episode. I won't go into depth but this episode will wretch your heart. However, it gives the series some balance with all of the invincibility of the main crew some of the good guys need to go down and this was a good way to do it.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Another great CD from a great band.  I enjoy listening to each and every song on this CD just like their first CD.  The songs that the lryics really hit home for me because of people I know in my life.  Somewhere I belong, Easier to run, Faint, and Breaking the Habit.<br />But just listen to the whole CD start to finish song for song and lryics for lryics and I am sure they will speak to you as they spoke to me because they were very powerful lryics.  Keep that mind open as you listen also and this band might shock you into liking some new music.
B005EM8O8O|5.0|I don't write many reviews but felt I had to weigh in on this book.  I am an avid reader but this is the first Robert Harris book for me.  I notice most of the negative reviews compare this to some of his other work.  I won't repeat a synopsis of the book as several other folks already have done excellent jobs.  All I can say is that if this this book compares unfavorably to his other work, they must be dynamite.  I thought the main characters were well defined and developed and the pace was masterful.  I highly recommend.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Linkin Park a great rock band and always will be.  I own almost all their CD's, I listen to each and every one of their CD's with an open mind because the lryics always speak to me for they tell you a story threw the lryics that Mike and Chester create threw their experiences.  I gave it 5 stars because only for one reason and one reason alone I enjoy every song off the CD even Chester screaming into the mike on track 4 Lies Greed Misery.  But I love the whole CD so I can't choose my favorite songs off it.  If your true Likin Park fan then pick this music CD up and listen to it with a true open mind for it has rock music, screaming music, softer songs, and so forth.  But to me this is one of the best CD's of the year and a great music CD from Likin Park and I hope they keep it up for all future albums.
0345803485|1.0|This is unequivocally one of the most dreadful books I have ever read!  I was so bored it took me weeks to get half way through it. I finally admitted defeat and put it down for good.  I simply could not justify wasting another moment of my life reading this drivel.  I fail to understand how this makes it to any best seller list in any part of the world!!  The writing is juvenile at best, and that is the kindest thing I can think to say at the moment.<br /><br />I have no issue with the topic of the story, I enjoy a good erotic story as much as anyone, and the world of Dominance and submission in particular is of interest to me.  However this book comes across as written by someone with no knowledge about the \\"lifestyle\\" she is writing about except what she has read on the internet.  It is not the subject matter that I object to; it is the horrendous writing and the completely unrealistic characters and story that I found truly disturbing.<br /><br />So many writers out there who deserve recognition and acclaim for the true talent they consistently display in their writing, and this garbage becomes a best seller???  Seriously?<br /><br />I will not waste any more of my time or yours repeating what so many others have said, other than to say that this book is AWFUL!!  This is $9.99 and minutes of my life that I will never get back...what a waste!!!  I regret that I cannot rate it as a minus 5 stars!!
B00004Z459|5.0|linkin Park's first cd amazing start for a great rock band.  To me this was mind blowing when it first came out and to this day still find it blows my mind every time I listen to the whole CD.  They also as a added point have one of my favorite music video's for the song In the End, so check it out on yahoo music.  If your looking for solid rock music from start to finish this is the CD for you to pick up an amazing album to blast in your car on the way to work.

158234082X|5.0|This is not the type of book that I normally read. After watching Bourdain on his show, I really wanted to read some of his work. I was not disappointed. Even though I am in no way involved in the food industry, and have no intention ever to be, Bourdain made reading about all of the finer details of the industry very enjoyable to read. That on top of all the personal stories made this a really great book.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Some people are so dumb, anyone read that comment all the way like 2nd to last er somethin'? Says this's a 1 dollar app at best?? Someone either really hares Spidey or not sober when writing their reveiw. I believe that 7 dollars is appropriate for this app. I mean how free roam app games are there?? I don't know of any. And then people complain about there being one boss when there's free roam on an APP. People are expecting way to much from an app.
B005LAIH3G|1.0|a crap movie,one of those movies were the 60 second preview, is the best part of the movie,very disapointed with this dvd,as they say never judge a book by the cover
B005IQZB14|5.0|Loved this book- story of self-realization and finding personal strength and abilities. Talks of challenge, fortitude and determination. a level of honesty that might come back to haunt the author.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This and Star Trek II, are the best movies in the series. The crew of the Enterprise are about to retire, and like the real world scenerio. When Cherynoble exploded, a Klingon moon explodes. Forcing the Klingons into  a situation where they have to make peace with the Federation, the federation offers an olive branch. Captain Kirk and his crew, now some have said that they didn't like the fact that the characters were portraid as being bigoted. Well I hate to break it to ya, but Nicolas Meyer is right. They were bigoted, Kirk didn't just dislike the Klingons. He hated them, And to disagree with William Shatner. But the Klingons were indeed looked on as the trash of the galaxy, what's awsome about this movie is that the plot to kill chancelor Gorkon. Is orchastrated my several people, including Gen Chang. A Klingon himself, and I must say that Christopher plummer plays him extremely well. Truly one of the best bad guys in the star trek universe, The Klingon ambassador is killed, Kirk and Mccoy are imprisoned. Accused of being the ones that set up the assassination, i do agree with one reviewer that the romance between Spock and Valaraas seems forced. Now while Kim catrell does an awsome job, that storyline could have been left out. And again to disagree with some reviewers, I thought the mind meld between Spock and Valaraas was fine. This movie has action, suspense, and it's a political Thriller. And yes Kirk comes to realize that peace really must exist between the Klingons and the Federation.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|quick entertaining fun, but i don't like all of the pop up ads. Especially when my kids play.  Its too easy for them to exit game to purchase items for points.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Now I'm not a huge Marvel comics fan, but i have to say. Having read some of the Iron Man comics, this movie is spot on. Robert Downey Jr. does an awsome job as Tony Stark, the good thing is , that this movie isn't afraid to be a comic book movie. From watching Stark build his suit in the cave, to all the interactions with the other characters. This is a fun movie
030758836X|5.0|A really explosive start; completely knocks you off your feet--I couldn't let go of it until the plot steadied a little, when it centred on Nick (the husband). Like a terrible storm, after the brief lull moments the plot explodes again, with twists that were totally unexpected.<br /><br />There were so many reviews for this book, I initially considered not to bother writing. However, the story and execution were so thrilling, that even if the words in the review are not read, its weight in votes gets counted.<br />Overall, a very entertaining read.
B0081L391C|1.0|How people get funding to produce this type of trashy movie is beyond me.  The best scenes are those seen in TV commercials the rest of the movie is potty / trash humor. I wish I had never rented this movie and could get my money back. I hate supporting trash like this, save your money and find something else to watch.
0385344228|4.0|A medley of ideas: love, filial duties, fragility of marriage, sociological concepts, murder, mystery and legal proceedings--all combine into a decent thriller.<br /><br />The characters are depicted in a way that sometimes lacks a degree of realism, though at times this approach works well, yielding an enigmatic perspective that flows well with the style of writing.<br /><br />On a more negative note: The plot starts well but slows considerably, which ultimately spoils the spectacular twist at the end.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is really good if you can get around the f word throughout the book I highly reccommend it.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|(I wrote this this morning on John Wetton's guestboard)<br /><br />Finally listened in depth to the new work on my home sound system this weekend and what a musical treat to the ears. My car system just doesn't pick up your bass work very well John. I also heard all of these different nuances in the background of the songs and it's an extremely tight piece of work. You guys have certainly created a vibe very close to the first album.<br /><br />John your bass work is thunderous, low and almost ominous. Your vocal work and especially the harmonizing is almost spiritual. Geoff seems to be the glue creating a sonic landscape around the tunes like a multi colored tapestry. I didn't think in all honesty that Carl and Steve could play like they've caught fire anymore but they've proven me seriously wrong. Carl sounds like he's tightened those drum heads and shows that he still has the fastest hands in rock today. Steve what can I say? I think this is some of his finest guitar work since his Keys to Ascension YES work in 96, 97. His work floored me there and it does so again here.<br /><br />All in all I loved Phoenix and Omega immensely, Extraordinary Life alone being a life affirming triumph. But here on XXX you've all given me the album that I was hoping for. What sounds to me like the true successor to the first album. Putting that Dragon and Pearl on the cover was a risky move on all your parts as it could have easily blown up in your collective faces if the work didn't measure up. No worries as the circle is complete and the music is fully worthy.<br /><br />Thanks again guys. I hope my words were able to express my feelings for the music. Looking forward to seeing where you guys take it from here?
B004EBZX6W|5.0|My home WiFi was running slow. Used this application to analyze the WiFi networks near me. The app even recommended the best channel for my router to eliminate interference and I now have the strongest signal! Easy to use and the outputs are easy to read and understand, even for a networking novice.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book was wonderful I read all three in a week. I wish there was more then only three books. I love that I was sable to read them on my kindle. What a wonderful experience.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Definitely worth $0.99. Fun mystery game with puzzles to solve. Nice graphics and storyline. Wish there were a lot more games like this.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Most games try to sell you on $5 or $10 purchases. I caught my son about to drop $99.99 for a pile of &quot;acorns&quot;.  No kids app should allow that. I will never install a gameloft product again.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I did not like this app. I was trying to make a spreadsheet and you can't without buying the full version.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is a tremendous movie in that you get a real sense of what our heroes go through each and every day for us. While the plot does get a bit campy and is somewhat predictable, nevertheless, it is awe-inspiring to know such warriors exist and protect us while we sleep.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!!!!!!!! I played it all the time on my brothers ipod and he would always get soooo mad but now I hav it on my kindle!!!!!!!!!!!! love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006H8BIIM|5.0|It's basically a tower defense game, but with the best graphics and game play I've seen so far. Also, you can build your structures anywhere instead of being bound to a grid.<br /><br />I had so much fun with this game. I finally beat it without any in app purchases and it was fun and challenging all the way. The game play requires some strategy and it seems like I'm always learning something new. Definitely got my money's worth out of it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it only has 15 levels in campaign mode. This game hasn't had any updates since 2010. It would be so easy for the developer to release more levels, but it has clearly been abandoned, which is sad for such an awesome game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The first digital reading I have ever done. It was so fast, and conveniently accessible to me wherever I went. And, the most important fact was that it was so low cost for such an awesome book. I thoroughly enjoyed it  and the one after it too. It was the fastest reading that I have ever done cause it was very difficult to stop reading it until it was finished. Thanks to Amazon, I was able to get it in no time at all and enjoy the book completely..
B0087OXDDC|5.0|Phrasal verbs wonderfully explained and put in context. Phrasal verbs made easy.<br />A clever tool for learning them in an effective way. Really helpful !

B005LAIIRQ|4.0|This is a dark film and does not have a \\"happy ending\\", but the ending is appropriate and poetic. Make sure you watch through the credits for a brief shot that takes place after the final scene. A very good cast and a very focused story.
B0049U4INC|5.0|Very well written and informative - I am sure to read this book over again to make sure I do not forget the concepts compiled by Mr. Kawasaki. A pleasurable read and pure nourishment for developing a business sense.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Seeing as how this album didn't get a US release until 2012, I'm willing to go ahead and call Imaginaerum the album of the year. Anette's vocals are powerful and haunting throughout.

Buy it!<br /><br />- Charlie Morgan<br />Best-Selling author of Sticks And Stones
0307949508|5.0|I normally do not expect a sequel to be better than the 1st book, but this one is an exception. I very much liked the first, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\", but this goes way beyond that book.<br />The book is not for a sensitive soul or an idealistic one. It is raw and brutal and touches on aspects of life that perhaps we would rather not know about. Somehow the author puts humanistic and idealism and heroism in that pool of muck and creates an ever twisting, riveting conflict.<br />The heroine is not saint. I loved her because she isn't a saint. She is not the sterotype smart blond with an improbable body (that we see so often on TV); she is a a waif. A waif with a piercing intelligence that will get her mission does. She is violent and extremely anti-social and a true misfit for good reason too. In this sequel the reason that the heroine, Salander, acts like that is exposed. We finally understand the roots of her behavior.<br />The actions and reactions of the people around her are written masterfully and convincingly. The threads of substories are interesting in themselves and you quickly realize that those stories are there for a reason and sooner or later all those threads will be woven together with surprises.<br />The sections on the outlandish connections the press made without proper documentation made me want to scream. However, I realize that this sort of exaggeration goes on everyday. Thus we are forced to look at the creation of sensationalism in the press and see what it is - it sells newpapers and ruins people's lifes. It judges without a jury. It labels and implies and misstates almost without restrain. It is out price for a free press but also the curse of it. If you read this book just to focus on this material you will have an eye opener.<br />I found myself reading this book much faster than the first. When I finished I just had to go out and buy the third and last book. I did not wait to order it from Amazon, but found it at a bookstore. This is something I rarely do, but the series is that good.<br />If you liked \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\" you must read this and then buy the third one too.is something I rarely do, but the series is that good.<br />If you liked \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo\\" you must read this and then buy the third one too.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was one of of the best books I have ever read.  I could not put it down, plus I had to look at the end to see what happened.  It was very well written considering it has such a controversial subject.  Would I read more from the writer, bring it on!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This series meets all my reading needs: long enough that I am not finished before it really gets going, intrique, danger and love. The element of the time travel is believable and makes for a more intriguing and breath-holding story. I have learned a lot about history as I have looked up the timelines and read about other things happening at the same time. I am already 2 books ahead of this one and they haven't let me down yet. Don't stop now. They get better and better!

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I am so excited by this series, this book, like the previous books in the series, was captivating  reading, the adventure continues with many unexpected events and characters. I so look forward to the next book, which I hope is not too far away.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|Wife is very happy with this item. I purchased it for her birthday and she is enjoying it very much. Thanks amazon for the great prices.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Persuasion is perhaps my 3rd favorite Jane Austin book, after Pride and Prejudice and Sense & Sensibility. After having read the book for the umpteenth time, I saw the movie on Amazon and decided to get it to my  DVD collection.<br /><br />Amanda Root was well cast for Anne Elliot, and Ciarán Hinds and very fine and dashing Captain Frederick Wentworth. My favorite of the cast was Fiona Shaw as Mrs. Croft, she was simply perfect, sister to Captain Wentworth and wife to Admiral Croft (John Woodvine). Corin Redgrave an absolutely perfect and vain Sir Elliot, Samuel West made a scrumptious Mr. Elliot but, Phoebe Nicholls would have been better in a Cinderella story as an evil stepsister, she did not work at all (for me) as Elizabeth Elliot. Sophie Thompson, as Anne and Elizabeth's younger sister, did well in portraying the slightly spoiled, unhappy, hypochondriac, bored woman with a little too much pride and too little tact. And last but not least Susan Fleetwood as \\"meddling\\" Lady Russel.<br /><br />The emotions between Anne and Frederick were a little understated, but I think that would have been the case given the time period. I did not doubt for a minute that it was hard for Anne to finally see Frederick again, though it was much harder to glean his feelings for her. It was subtle. Had I not read the book I would have thought him wholly indifferent towards her, up until he shows up in Bath. And I think that is the whole point of the story. Neither of them know for sure how the other one feel, but you don't get the whole \\"EMO\\" effect you would have seem if the story was written some 150 years later.<br /><br />I also find that the movie stayed true (enough) to the book for my liking.<br /><br />4 Stars.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Wife is very happy with this item. I purchased it for her birthday and she is enjoying it very much. Thanks amazon for the great prices.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Keira Knightley is perfect as Elizabeth Bennet. Then again, I don't ever recall seeing Keira Knightley in any movie where she didn't become the part and make it her own. Matthew Macfadyen was absolutely amazing. I really didn't think anyone could top Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, but somehow Matthew Macfadyen WAS Mr. Darcy, no doubt. Their chemistry was a perfect blend of annoyance and sparks, you were never quite sure what you would get. Rosamund Pike is perhaps one of the prettiest actors I can think of, and the most perfect Jane Bennet.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland & Brenda Blethyn were the perfect Mr. and Mrs Bennet. They too had a chemistry as husband and wife that was believable and loving.<br /><br />The best cast (IMHO) was Claudie Blakley as Charlotte Lucas. I think I liked her much better after seeing the movie. I have read the book a good maybe 25+ times (if not more) and seen the movies (both versions) many times.<br /><br />5 stars
B007P6VM04|5.0|Wife is very happy with this item. I purchased it for her birthday and she is enjoying it very much. Thanks amazon for the great prices.
B007C3TVNA|5.0|The movie is a chilling look at one mother's struggle to cope with a sociopath. It is a bit artsy; however, it is great.  Many of her flashbacks will stay with you for days.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy in all was a great read. I definitely will recommend this book. The characters were very interesting, which made me not want to stop reading it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Just great; this shows what excitement, drama, and intellect can actually be made for TV / movies. A thinking person's (adult sophistication, but \\"P. G.\\" for 10 year olds & up) thrillers - without Hollywood's lust for gun blazing, big explosions, and under currents of racism/ fear porn. Holmes, Watson, & all the trappings expertly weaves into 2012 society / technologies (Sherlocke armed with a MacBook, mobile texting Watson & Scotland Yard!)!<br />Where's more (Season 3)? Best TV ever???
B001EYU1VO|5.0|I have had this joystick for more than a year and every button still works, all axis responsive.  The buttons are placed very well.  When the joystick is extended properly it is very stable on a desk surface.  I bought mine at the store, I didn't order it.  The only minor complaints would be the location of the 5 button and slight stiffness of the X/Y axis, but no big deal.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The literary contributions of this book are nonexistent. Not being a prude,and in fact someone who enjoys good erotic literature,I purchased this book.  I could not dedicate the time to finish it as I found it poorly written, predictable and just plain redundant. Women have been duped!
0553386794|3.0|\\"Winter is coming.\\" The Starks, wardens of the North, understand this more than many. It will be a harsh and cruel season that lasts for years.<br /><br /> King Robert is circled by lairs and fools. Can he trust anybody? He's even unsure of his wife's family; The Lannisters. Do they follow his banner or another? There is one person above all he has faith in. His brother in name and won in battle, who fought at his side and helped gain him the crown of the Seven Kingdoms. He names and appoints Lord Eddard Stark as his Hand of the King.<br /><br /> Before they can leave for the Kings Landing, Bran, Stark's young son, accidently discovers the Queen's secret. She has been unfaithful and her loyalty remains strong within her family, the Lannisters and against those of her husband. To still the fallout, Bran is pushed from a tall tower.<br /><br /> One Stark down? Not yet. Another attempt is made to kill Bran is foiled but Summer, his direwolf saves his life. Their enemy or one of many is identified and the Starks seek vengeance and justice.<br /><br /> Across the narrow sea, a marriage is arranged between Daenerys and a fierce warrior clan in the hopes of making an army and taking back Rhaesh Andahle, their land.<br /><br /> I was not impressed by Book one of this series. I started by watching HBO and I was excited to read the book. I wanted those finer details the directors are unable to show on screen. I was disappointed. Where was the depth of emotions and details I saw on screen? They were missing as if this novel was written as a screen play rather than a slice of life. The motivation for the characters was as dry as when a history professor gives a lecture to grade school students.

0375842209|5.0|I absolutley loved this book. It took me a little bit of time to get into it but once you start to get invested in the characters it is so hard to put down. For younger people it is a good book to read to start to understand what happened in Germany during WW2 without totally scaring them off from the atrocities of what happened. Even though it is a young adult book I recommend it to everyone!!!!

0671027344|3.0|I´m a 21 year old who loves reading so naturally I became very interested on this book since everyone was talking about it. I´m not going to lie, the \\"On that moment I swear we were infinite\\" phrase really appealed to me.<br /><br />It´s a very thin and easy to read book. The language used (and the whole story) is meant to be understood by teenagers who might feel identified with the topics, but for more avid readers I would definitely suggest something else.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|like a picture search game and other minigames with a filler plot that keeps it moving. good on android tablet.  no gliches.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I thought the puzzles would increase in difficulty but they don't. Fun but not very hard to solve. Having to solve them in under 5 minutes makes it a little more interesting.
B004I2K4E8|2.0|I'm going to try to avoid commenting on the cast/performance because this is really a personal opinion.  Suffice it to say that I own a few versions of Les Mis already, and I liked this one enough to want to buy yet another, and I hardly buy anything. (I own 2 blu rays total, this and the Phantom 25th anniversary performance).  Sadly, the best way to know if you will like a cast is to hear/watch it first.  I had the luxury of watching it on PBS, and aside from Marius I loved it.<br /><br />Technically, however, this product is a travesty.  Visually, there is a very distracting motion artifact.  Another reviewer has pretty convincingly diagnosed it as a poor transfer from a 24fps source.  It seems like every second or so it's rewinding a fraction of a second, but trying to hide it by morphing from one time frame to the next.  You don't notice it so much when the camera is still and focused on a performer (if you notice at all, you might just think it's a shaky camera), but when it pans across the stage (like in the finale) it is almost headache-inducing.<br /><br />From an audio perspective, everything on stage sounds far away and tinny, while the crowd is crystal clear and way too loud.  I have to routinely turn up the volume for the performance and turn it back down for the applause. (this is the reason why I'm writing a review, I haven't seen anyone mention this flaw yet) I've done some testing, and at least some of this is because the 5.1 audio mixing is very, very intentionally terrible.  All the voices and 99% of the orchestra are in the front 3 speakers.  Meanwhile the surround speakers are literally 99% useless noise and a few randomly chosen instruments or moments from the orchestra.  I say useless noise because the surround speakers are almost exclusively playing a cavernous echo that makes everything sound far away and tinny.  That's right, they did it on purpose.  People don't buy home videos so that they can fantasize about sitting in the cheap seats, guys.  The surround speakers also carry the amplified crowd noise that I have to mute after every song.  As far as the \\"random bits of orchestra\\", let's take the \\"Look Down\\" prologue as an example.  Aside from the cavernous echo there is nothing that comes out of the surround speakers, except for the guitar riff between verses.  What?  Why?  And how hard did they have to try to do something so useless?  2.0 audio sounds better, which doesn't seem like it should be a valid compliment (they successfully remix the random bits of orchestra back in from the surround speakers, without adding the cavern or the extra crowd).  I'm not sure if it gets rid of all the \\"tinny\\" qualities yet, but it definitely helps a lot.<br /><br />While reading the reviews here, what struck me as really odd was the criticism of Lea Salonga, and specifically that her voice was weak -- of the Eponines and Fantines from the 3 casts I own (Broadway, 10th, and now 25th), I'd say Lea's is \\"strongest\\" in the sense that she has the best projection (which is what I think people mean by \\"weak\\" vs \\"strong\\" or \\"powerful\\").  I said I wouldn't talk too much about cast opinions, but I think the technical inferiority of this product might be partially shaping people's opinions of this performance.  I think the hollow quality of the disc's audio is hitting Fantine's role harder than most.  Just throwing that out there.<br /><br />I dug up my old DVR that has the PBS recording (digital 1080i) of this performance for comparison.  Off the bat, there is no reverse morphing effect in the video, which is a huge plus.  I think there are some re-compression artifacts from being broadcast, but that is small potatoes compared to the morphing.  Out of the box, the PBS broadcast sounds better than the blu ray 5.1 because there's no cavern effect, but PBS or my DVR did something odd to the channels.  I'm not getting surround left/right at all, and front left/right seem to be duplicated to rear left/right.  So there's no cavern or loud crowd, but then whatever random orchestral bits they put in surround left/right is lost (e.g., I don't hear the guitar riff in the prologue as described above).  Like I said earlier, I still haven't entirely decided if blu ray 2.0 audio fully gets rid of the empty quality of the recording.  That's probably the tiebreaker between whether I think PBS audio or blu ray 2.0 is superior (I know I've been satisfied with the audio spectrum of PBS, but now I also know that it's missing some unknown portion of the orchestra).<br /><br />Sadly, I can't think of another way to own the 25th anniversary performance, which I very much would like to have.  That's the only reason why I'm not giving 1 star to the product, because there is no other option (the 2010 cast recording is not the same thing).
B00371V6SE|4.0|It had a good story line. I found I couldn't put it down. The ending wasn't what I expected. Recommend it to all. Must read some of his other books.

0606259090|5.0|Anastasia Steele is young, naive and innocent, and normally the type of woman that Christian Grey is attracted to.  Though he warns her off, she refuses to leave and instead becomes putty in his hands - or does she?  How will this unlikely union work out?  Fifty Shades of Grey is bold, insightful informative, intriguing - and at times, humorous.  If sensual is a single sex word, then this book is meant just for women.  If it is not and you are comfortable with your sexuality and confident in your ability to make your own decisions and good choices, read this book.  It allows for a precipice edge virtual tour of a society defined taboo without the requirement to step off the edge.  If you are comfortable with your sensuality, it is a must-read for you; if you are not comfortable with your sensuality. . . it is a must-read for you!<br />  Eulus Dennis, author - Living Between The Line
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Nice change in puzzle style game play. Makes me really think about what I'm doing. I've chewed up quite a bit of time trying to solve these. If you want a game that while eat up time but you can drop without losing your place... Give it a try.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun. Makes you feel like apart of history. Played the game in Middle School. Nice to relive a part of my youth.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is a great realistic fiction novel by R.J. Palacio. August, the main character, was born with severe birth defects on his face. August's mother homeschooled him until fifth grade to protect him from the world. That's when they decided to enroll August into Beecher Prep Middle School. Middle school kids can be mean and not everyone was accepting of August. Fortunately, there were a couple of student's that stepped up and saw Auggie for who he really was.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this novel is that it is told in eight parts and each part is told by a different narrator. Auggie starts out telling the story and then in part two his sister, Via, is the narrator. Palacio does a great job of giving each character a clear voice so you can always tell who is telling the story. I liked knowing what each character's individual perspective was; it made for a much more interesting story.<br /><br />I love the overall message in this novel, \\"If every single person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place.\\" - Mr. Tushman, the Middle School Director. I highly recommend this novel to my students. We all could stand to be a little kinder to each other.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game started out fun, trying to figure out how to do each puzzle.  Then it continues being fun, as you work on harder and harder puzzles.  The game will continue to be fun, as there are a lot of puzzles I haven't gotten to yet.  It's worth the price because there are so many puzzles you will be playing this for a long long time.

Written from the perspective of 5 year old Jack, the story is engaging, the perspective is unique and the experience is both touching and horrifying at the same time.  It's a must read!
B007V508CC|5.0|After seeing so many bad reviews, I felt I had to weigh in. This album is definitely more \\"poppy\\" than their others, and that may be disappointing to some of Maroon 5's loyal fans. While I am usually not one to dig pop songs, this CD makes me want to sing along and dance in my car. Granted, there are a couple of duds on this album, in particular \\"Sad\\", but most of the others are just fun. I am hoping they will go on tour for this album soon because I can't wait to see them perform these songs live. Don't over-think this album. Just sit back, crank it up, and enjoy.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|Got this on time and boxed up so well that it was in pristine condition when I opened it. Lots of stuff in the box as stated in the material I looked at before purchase. IF!! you are a West Side Story fan as I am, you will enjoy this great blu-ray version. I particularly liked the commentary on the dance sequences. It was really well done and highly informative. The video quality is as good as it gets!  A real treat to sit down and watch. I recommend it highly.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well written and captivating to a fault! The fault being that not only can't you put it down, but when you find that you must, your every waking moment is thinking about what you already read and wondering what you will read next!

B001HN6922|4.0|Cars (2006) was set in the hopeful neon-infused twilight of humanity, robot creations still steeped in the better values of the creators.  Just after an unspecified human exinction event, artificially-intelligent self-driving cars emerge as the dominant beings on earth.  They lead an idyllic existence, enjoying the freedom to roam in world newly theirs.  Sport centers around more-or-less fair racing competitions, where performers and observes exhibit values and emotions that would make their ethics module engineers proud: misbehavior goes no further than shirking duty or physically aggressive racing.<br /><br />With global energy supplies running down, in Cars 2 the world of these self-driving, nanotech-expressive cars turns considerably darker.  It opens with a deadly battle over hidden oil reserves involving AI destroyers, huge explosions, and the movie's first fatalities.  In this militarized, postapocalyptic world, even simple tow-trucks bristle with concealed weapons.  Murder and deception are commonplace in the struggle for energy dominance.  The role of racer McQueen evolves from overpowered maverick rookie to naive foil, as he remains one of the few unarmed believers in the old order.  He races full out in an increasingly meaningless contest as darker and more dangerous forces battle all-out over the future of their world.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game!!! Fun to play would recommend it to anyone who loves puzzle games. A little challenging but loads of fun.

B005BOHYW2|4.0|This book alternately entranced me and drove me mad! The main character, Victoria, is a young woman brought up in foster care and community homes who loses her chance at adoption through her own actions. She is a self destructive character and continually fights shy of love, even of the touch of another human being. We see her previous life with Elizabeth, the woman who fostered her for over a year and wanted to adopt her. Elizabeth teaches her the language of flowers. We flash forward to her life as she makes a floristry business for herself using Elizabeth's teachings. She finds a man who loves her but initially throws it away in her self destructive distrust.<br /><br />The writing in this book was delightful. I loved the constant closeness of the flowers; they and their meanings were woven into everything. I found Victoria's constant rejection of love a bit hard to swallow. I would have thought that she would have valued it more highly than those who take it for granted. I found this aspect of the story hard to credit and rather over-emphasised. She behaved far too often as the petulant and stubborn child that I could believe in the first part of the story. It was a stretch too far to believe that she carried this forward into her later life to such an extent.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it was an entrancing story and very unusual in its conception. I enjoyed it a great deal and would recommend it to anyone, especially to those who love or work with flowers.

B007L3BMGA|2.0|I love books, I own hundreds. I didn't love this. I found the characters thin to the point of anorexia, the story poorly researched, and the editing almost invisible. I wanted to enjoy it - I had heard so much about it - but by page 12 it was becoming a struggle I was about to lose. It seems a shame really because with more work it could have been good.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is a skillful songwriter and has a rich voice.  This album is immediately appealing and is in danger of being overplayed in our house.  Sometimes album's that aren't so 'catchy' at first, have a longer play life in the end.  21 can't justy be classed as merely pop though,  although it's appealing there is a depth and maturity to this cd beyond her 21 years.
034580404X|5.0|These books are amazing. The material is seductive, and so addicting! I read the whole series in about 2 or 3 weeks. She's a great author...can't wait for the movie to come out.
0061990477|5.0|I first purchased The Thorn Birds in 1984 and have, quite literally, re-read this amazing novel at least twice a year since!  As soon as your fingers find the first page, you are no longer a simple reader of a fictional tale, instead you are transformed and become part of a journey complete with forbidden love, angst, sorrow, inner turmoil and internal and sacrificial strength.  If you are a woman, I trust that you will remember back to the very first time you fell in love and how he was (as most of us once thought) irreplaceable and would forever be embedded within the fibers of your being.  This is a story of Meggie Cleary and her lifelong struggle to overcome the love she has for the (forbidden) Priest, Father Ralph de Bricassart.  Their emotional journey through several decades will forever change the way you think about love and the sacrifices you made in your own life to have something you want or letting go something that is truly, not meant to be.  This one is a keeper!  My book is falling apart at the seams and is held together with two rubber bands so that should tell you something.  Enjoy!!!
006197806X|5.0|The second book of the series (Delirium). I liked the layout of this book. It jumps from Then and Now in each chapter until the Then and Now come together. I wasn't as impressed with the second book as was with the first, but that's not to say this one isn't amazing as well. It only took me one day to read this one, I couldn't put it down. I cannot wait for the last book to come out so I can see how this series ends.
0307592731|1.0|This stupidly named author Cheryl Strayed (can't she pick a better name than that?) tells all about her hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.  First, she is totally unprepared for the hike and expects us to feel sympathy for her.  It is her own stupidity.  Next she tells us all about her sexual and heroin adventures (which is all she seems to care about).  I kept thinking about her children and the life she is teaching them when they get old enough to read.  It made me cringe.  Thirdly she didn't seem to get any monumental new insights about life (the purpose of her trek).  My only insight was that this self-absorbed woman deserves our pity; but most of all I pity her children.
0061726834|5.0|This has to be one of the best books I've read in quite a while. I don't want to give away all the details, but it really makes you think. How different could our lives be if love was considered a disease, something awful to stay away from or risk death?<br /><br />I read this book about a month ago and I still find myself thinking about the characters and what life would be like if I lived in the world that Lena lived in.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Until reading this book, I was very confused with all of the information out there and it was preventing me from getting back to working out again.  This book speaks to you as if you had no knowledge about training and dieting, which honestly is great after all the misinformation that I've been filling my head with.  It's a very easy read while still providing great detail and analysis.  I read the book in basically one sitting and now I can't wait to begin the Year One Challenge!<br /><br />The best part about the purchase is the author himself.  I had a few questions and concerns after finishing the book and emailed him.  He was very quick to respond and provided helpful information and was very generous in offering his advice if needed in the future.<br /><br />Definitely the best $5.99 I've ever spent, and it will easily pay for itself with its advice on avoiding certain supplements that are just a money trap!

B00846TTDG|5.0|A great movie that depicts the respect, confidence and trust of each other that only exists for those of us that have served. The support for family and the willingness to put their lives on the line to protect the rights and freedoms of those that have never served or are not willing to serve.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I love all kinds of adventure games, but this game has no instructions. You find your self retracing your pathways over and over having no idea what to do, where to go next. Very frustrating. Can't believe anyone rated it 5 stars. Will stay away from any games like this.
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|This movie makes you think especially if you like continuity problems.  I expected perfection from Abrams and Spielberg.  You can sit back, like in Mystery Science Theater 3000, and criticize for a couple of hours with little rest.  If these numerous minor problems are overlooked it is enjoyable.  Be forewarned, the audio is very low but the action scenes are extremely loud so be prepared.
030758836X|5.0|By the time Nick Dunne provides us, his avid readers, with this insight into his character, we've already figured it out, thanks to Gillian Flynn's masterful ability to drop one twist after another into this chilling tale, in such as a way to cause a kind of literary double take of such magnitude that if it were a physical response, I'd by now be hospitalized with whiplash.<br /><br />This is certainly the best thriller I'll read this year, and possibly this decade -- and I don't say that lightly. Flynn took me on a hair-raising journey, the equivalent of speeding along a slick, twisting highway at night, with not even a railing separating the car from a plunge down a cliff and into the ocean -- and I simply couldn't put the novel down. Every time I thought I had figured out where she was taking me -- and at what point this novel would relapse into classic \\"thriller mode\\", with a relatively predictable denouement -- she proved me wrong. Better yet, she made each twist completely convincing.<br /><br />The novel itself is the saga of an unraveling marriage that climaxes in the disappearance of Amy Elliott Dunne, Nick's wife, on their fifth wedding anniversary. It's an ironic nod of sorts to so many true-life tragedies (there's even a vitriolic Nancy Grace-style television commentator!), but also a deep dive into a kind of toxic relationship that had me thinking three or four times about every individual I've come into contact with. Amy is the photo-perfect victim: blond, beautiful, the model for her parents' best-selling series of children's books featuring \\"Amazing Amy\\". But just how amazing is Amy? Well, fairly -- if perhaps not in the sense that we are used to viewing our \\"victims\\". The slow and gradual revelation of the layers of this story is tantalizing; the nature of what is revealed is chilling. And the real climax of the book is quite possibly the best I've read in any thriller -- Flynn shuns any thought of the \\"easy out\\" when looking for a conclusion, and the final pages left me gasping in astonishment at her imagination and the effortless way she holds all the strands of this narrative together -- and at the plot itself. If this isn't turned into a blockbuster movie, Hollywood execs should be lined up against a wall and shot.<br /><br />On holiday and it's raining, or too hot to go outside? Grab this, and you'll forget about your sunburn, your heatstroke, the mosquito bites and pretty much anything else. On the other hand, it will make you re-evaluate everything your spouse says and does for days and quite possibly weeks... It's not literature, but it's the epitome of a \\"thumping good read\\", and you should stop reading this review now and just go get it -- bookstore, library or just purloin your friend's copy before he/she has finished. 4.5 stars, rounded up.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I got an advance reading copy of this book via NetGalley.he final pages left me gasping in astonishment at her imagination and the effortless way she holds all the strands of this narrative together -- and at the plot itself.

0670023329|5.0|There is always a great deal of hand wringing when history's greatest monsters are brought down about why we didn't do more.  This is one of the most horrifying stories about a regime that exists not just to survive but to imprison and torture a large body of its own population.  The evil that is North Korea is laid out for all to see here. On a more disturbing tale is the story of how the moral compass which most us take for granted is wiped out here.  Family, love, compassion and kindness are all destroyed in this warped view of humanity.<br /><br />This is a book which should be read so that we know about it and can not say we had no idea.  It's a slow motion democide where the target is a nations very own people. This is a very important book.

This CD also channels Radio Ethiopia and Easter.  Banga is the perfect gift to Patti's fans as it is a reflection of everything she does best....the powerful songwriting, the spoken word, spritual and metaphysical content, all delivered with a whirling dervish beat. Banga is true rock and roll for the intelligentsia. The spoonfed masses need not apply. Thank you Patti and the band for your continued contributions to Rock n Roll history.

It is about leadership, creativity, and how people grow up to be what they are good in!<br />very socially aware and intellectually designed to be politically correct as much as a Sci-Fi can be.<br />I think this book gives you a short and great picture of what American SCIENCE-WARFARE(NSF-DoD) complex is all rooted. it gives you a big picture of what many adult kids in real-world are possibly doing with their life.<br />the end was not the best it could be but I think it is only because I am reading this book in 2012 and not 1985!<br />it was a great job and I feel trapped when I am thinking about buying the next one in the sequel!

0606259090|2.0|I read this based on all the hype and man am I bummed I bothered. It is VERY repetitive in plot as well as descriptive words. TRY A THESAURUS!<br /><br />I feel like this was written porn. It's not about the plot but about the sex scenes... which ended up being VERY boring! It was supposed to be very BDSM, which is way different than most romance novels so it was a breath of fresh air... except, other than a very few scenes (which were vanillaed up) they were all typical sex scenes.<br /><br />The romance was awful! The male lead had all the attributes of an abusive spouse. And the lead female was a spinless ninny who ate this shit right up.<br /><br />If you MUST satisfy your curiosity,  BORROW the book and know that you've been warned.

0345803507|4.0|This review is strictly my opinion, I was not paid to write this.<br /><br />In this final book of the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" trilogy, a lot of questions are answered. For those readers wondering exactly what happened in Christian Grey's past, \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" gives you the insight you were looking for. Also, for everyone wondering what is going to come of Anastasia Steele and Christian, read this book by E.L. James to find out.<br /><br />NOTE: SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT IF PREVIOUS BOOKS OF THE TRILOGY WERE NOT READ!<br /><br />A lot has happened in the first two books of this trilogy. Christian wanted Ana to be his submissive and Ana wanted more. Then, they both realized they couldn't live without one another and decided to meet halfway. Christian decided he would rather give Ana the hearts and flowers relationship she wanted than be without her. Ana realized that she loves Christian regardless of his excessive baggage and wants him however she can have him. Her inner goddess also secretly likes the kinky stuff. But Ana just doesn't like Christian wanting to hurt her. In this third installment of the trilogy, Ana and Christian take the next step in their relationship - marriage. They decide to change their wedding vows slightly because Ana doesn't want to `promise to obey' Christian. Although Christian's family wanted him protected by a pre-nup, he wouldn't hear of it. He figured that if Ana left him, then she could take all his money anyway if it made her happy. After their beautiful wedding, the happy couple goes on their honeymoon to several different places in Europe. Ana and Christian have a wonderful time together and speak of their future and what their time together may bring. Ana dreams of having children with Christian later in their marriage, visualizing a young copper-haired boy running around in the meadow of their new home. They are beyond happy in their own bubble of a world, and do not want to go back to reality. Unfortunately, reality calls to them sooner than expected. There is still trouble lurking in the shadows, wanting to hurt them. After the sabotage of Christian's helicopter, Charlie Tango, security has tightened immensely. Somehow, trouble still manages to slip by and keep Ana and Christian on their toes. Who would want to hurt them so bad? What else does this person(s) have planned? Is it somebody that Ana and Christian know? Will Ana even have the chance of her dreams becoming a reality? Find out in \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" by E.L. James.<br /><br />I rate E.L. James' book 4 out of 5 stars. I would definitely recommend this read to somebody who is interested in Adult Romance/Erotica. I have to say that this book has less sex scenes than the first two, but it definitely has its moments! This third book is more about the growth of Ana and Christian's relationship and where the future will take them. It also answers a lot of questions that readers may have had from the first two books. I really enjoy that I was able to get a glimpse into Christian's past to better understand him. I liked this book a lot and would love to read more like it someday. It has been said that James is planning to write a book(s) from Christian Grey's perspective. I would personally love to read that because there is just so much to learn about him. Again, I like this 4 star book and I would recommend this intoxicating, revealing, and fun read \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" by E.L. James.<br /><br />Brianna Lee of Brianna Lee Book Reviews<br />[...]sooner than expected. There is still trouble lurking in the shadows, wanting to hurt them. After the sabotage of Christian's helicopter, Charlie Tango, security has tightened immensely. Somehow, trouble still manages to slip by and keep Ana and Christian on their toes. Who would want to hurt them so bad? What else does this person(s) have planned? Is it somebody that Ana and Christian know? Will Ana even have the chance of her dreams becoming a reality? Find out in \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" by E.L. James.<br /><br />I rate E.L. James' book 4 out of 5 stars. I would definitely recommend this read to somebody who is interested in Adult Romance/Erotica.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this bible is a life saver. when ever i need scripture in my heart or even when i don't  understand, this bible is available  at the click of a button. I love all the different versions. it helps me to fully understand the scripture better.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book!  Don't just buy book one buy all 3!  It's a story that makes you rethink love and how your childhood makes a difference!
B007NWPB4S|5.0|Hay Carly,<br /><br />  Well, it was bound to happen... and you Carly, did a great job of the old familar Malboro man cigarette commercial melody and made it into a fantastic catchy, unique, pop, dance number...We look foward to more of your fun music that we can understand the firt time we hear it.

B0007TKH66|3.0|I didn't watch Enterprise in first run.  Partly because Voyager had been such a let down and then I missed the pilot.  It is much like DS9 in the that it is best viewed more or less in order.  (Prodcution/viewing order gets skewed a bit in season two.)  Last summer I watched all but a handful of episodes on the feed from Star Trek.com.  Free yes-- but it had a few episodes missing including one of the highlights of Season One- Dear Doctor.  This is probably the strongest first season of any Star Trek save for original.  Are there some clunkers-- yes.  But overall the good outweigh the bad.  Scott Bakula, John Billingsley and Prada the Dog do some great work here.  The rest of the cast is good enough.
B0081L37Z0|2.0|I watch this movie expecting to like it.  Good cast and a great tv show that has become a movie.  I am not one that normally complains about language in a movie, but in the first 20 minutes of the movie I bet they don't go 90 seconds with out someone saying the F word or worse. The story week and most of the humor wasn't what I think is funny.  A few good spots here and there but overall BAD.  I haven't seen a movie this bad in years.  Maybe 22 Jump Street will be better.
B007KDFWRG|1.0|The samples I heard tells me that the audio is very weak. The audio equipment they used was not worthy of producing a commercial cd. It sounds like someone trying to produce their own cd in their backyard. I heard Susan and Derek in a Crossroads DVD and they sounded light years better than Everybody's Talkin. Sorry, I will not purchase this one.
B0079K4WEE|2.0|The idea of every human loosing their senses one by one is made interesting since  the non essential senses such as smell, then taste are lost first. We can certainly live without those, even if life looses much of its sensuality. Even lack of hearing can be overcome. However, the people of the world are presented with the looming possibility that they will loose their last and arguably most essential sense, sight. Can the people of the world live without any senses? Unfortunately this is not the supposition addressed by the plot. Instead we are presented with people coming together and showing empathy and love for one another when it appears imminent that they will loose their last sense, leaving in the dark and unable to communicate with each other. While many people may indeed bond and come together at this \\"apocolypse\\", realizing that all of humanity is bound together in this calamity the fact that this realization will be fleeting before everyone ends facing the reality that all - children, mothers, young and old, are in line for a terrible death, likely either by starvation, exposure or suicide since food production and distribution will end as will all transportation and utilities such as heat in the winter. While these are the dooming physical effects of this calamity, just as bad is the loss of inability to communicate, required if we are to be able work together for the common good and to help each other. If the filmakers just wanted to show us that life is truly a gift worth living and that we should appreciate each other this draconianm and artificial plot is not required. And while the two main characters end up back in each others arms this is more their desparation and need for communion with another human being in order to share the terrible end that is about to envelope them and everyone else. Not exactly the most compelling reason for people to fall in love.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|I watched this with my hubby, 16 year old and my 12 year old. We all LOVED it.<br /><br />I'm not an action movie fan myself, but this was a great mix of drama, action, and most of all...a very creative idea!  I won't give anything away that's not in the previews, but these three boys (one of whom is super popular/fun (Nick Cannon) and one who is a trying to change, and the star who is backwards and from an abusive home) find this...um...this thing. This thing changes them and they find they have these powers that allow them to move things with their minds!<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Chronicle is that it doesn't rush the FUN PART! If you could move things with your mind, what would you do for fun?? Well, these guys come up with some really great ideas of how to have fun with this power, and to me it's the best part of the movie! Then things start to become more serious....plus there is that nasty abusive father to deal with....<br /><br />I honestly think if you have even the slightest interest in Chronicle, you should watch it. Like I mentioned, I don't do action movies like King Kong or war movies..anything with big chase scenes (yawn) or lots of damage being done. I LOVED CHRONICLE!!<br /><br />Please, Please, if you love it, ask them to make a sequel!<br /><br />Hope this helps!<br /><br />Check out my books :)  Sheri Gill
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Unlike most fans, I actually loved A Thousand Suns, and When They Come For Me is possibly their best song ever, but I won't get into that here.  I'm also unlike a lot of music fans in that I actually expect my favorite bands to evolve, and their songs are supposed to reflect that.  LP has done exactly that, and like all of their albums, its set up to listen from A to Z and they are one of the few bands that do this well.  As others have said, this has a mix of styles we've come to expect, and yes, Burn It Down is just part 2 of The Great Divide, but so what. If you've written more than a handful of songs, like these guys have, you've discovered that the ideas go in tangents as well as in parallel lines and sometimes you want to share all of it rather than toss out half of your work only because the song would be 8 minutes long instead of 4.  But I digress.  Living Things takes steps both into the past and into the future. While some tracks are nothing earth shattering, it can easily be said that most people reading this would gladly listen to a so-so Linkin Park song, than what passes for a hit song on the radio in 2012.  The best part of this album is that Linkin Park is still here, still sharing and expanding their incredible sound, at a time when many of their contemporaries have \\"left the building\\" long ago.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Talk about \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\"--ON STEROIDS!!  Nicely portrayed lead characters, each  with their own hang-ups.  Christian could have easily been a cruel, demeaning sadist or been totally deranged, but the author chose another course---controlling, possessive and needy with lots of issues but still lovable.  The Anastatia character was overly naive for her age and with no sexual experience at all (come on, in 2011!).  But the way the author had her trying to determine Christian's mood swings was so much fun to read.  And Anastatia grows to became her own woman, determining her own needs.  Erotic, sexy, everything the reviews say it is.
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|Bands with the kind of success and longevity The Offspring have had are lucky to write even one hit song 20+ years later, and they've achieved that and so much more.  Like your favorite restaurant, this album offers up a menu of the familiar, along with some new things to keep you interested and coming back for another listen.  An excellent mix of punk, rock, ballad, and some good old helpings of the irreverent quirk-filled style that made them famous.  I own hundreds of CD's and only play about 30 of them from start to finish every time I push play.  Now I have 31.

B007ELN8Y8|2.0|I almost stopped watching after the first half hour.  It seemed that nothing was happening in the story and the music was starting to grate on my nerves.  But since I already paid for it, I kept watching.  Unfortunately it didn't get any more interesting. I was not impressed.  Usually an Academy Award Winner is a good show; this one, not so much.<br /><br />I was aware this film was silent before I rented it, but I didn't know that it wasn't widescreen.  If I had known that, I wouldn't have bothered renting the HD version.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There is not much to complain about when it comes to this game. You get 126 games in one app for free, what else could you ask for?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This was a very simply written book with no real complex story lines to follow. Each climax amped up and spooled down very quickly so there wasn't time to wrapped around any one situation. Some of the parts of the books were more exciting than others and at times it was like reading the same chapter over and over again.<br />I was a bit reluctant to read these books because I heard so much chatter over the explicit nature of the content, but after reading them did not feel so shocked. Perhaps I was expecting the worst so middle of the road wasn't so bad. After reading them I was glad I did and glad I read them in the Summer when I tend to pick up books that require less brain power.<br />I am sure this author is a female because she perfectly captured that thematic dilemma with women. We all want that gorgeous, bad boy, unobtainable man that every woman would love to have and envies the woman who does. The fact that he is wonderful in bed, rich and has a great family just sweetens the deal. We never feel good enough or pretty enough to catch let alone keep a man like that and that is where the age old challenge begins.<br />Anastasia is relatable in that manner. The not obviously beautiful girl next store with a shy innocence and threads of that insecurity, but not only does she catch the guy, she turns the tables on him and leaves him chasing her trying to figure out how to keep her. Isn't this the ultimate fantasy?<br />Despite all the wonderful sex scenes the story was a bit hokey and unbelievable. It was a bit too happy ending with everyone realizing a beautiful love story and finding their happily ever after.<br />Again, this is a great \\"junk food\\" read if you just want a happy ending, easy writing and little mental stimulation. I read all 3 books on my Kindle and overall enjoyed the stories. Book 2 was my least favorite as there was the least substance to that storyline.<br />This isn't a book I would race out to recommend to my friends but if they showed interest I would tell them it was a worthwhile read.
0606259090|5.0|Okay, so if you are contemplating reading this book and you read the one star reviews, ignore them.  Those are from people who obviously don't understand the point of this book. No, it's not a classic.  If you want that, read Steinbeck.  If you want to fall in love with a book and its characters, read this.  The snotty reviews I read are obviously from people who are unable to differentiate between fine literature and a love story that is meant for a beach read.  No, it's not one of those books that you deeply contemplate, but it is one that will make you think differently about men and their relationship with women.  It will spice up your love life.  Trust me.

B007L7JY3Y|5.0|Love the tabs. Not as distracting as many apps I have tried. I think I can finally delete all the others I have tried.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Another great read and a good tie up of the story from the first 2 books.<br />Still some unexpected outcomes which keep you reading
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I really liked this book. The characters were fully realized and their actions, motivations and reactions were very believable. A couple of warnings, though. First, do not read this book if you're dieting or live a long way away from an immediate chocolate fix. Second, if you enjoy this book at all, stay far away from the sequel. It does not do this book or the author justice.
B003LPV960|5.0|I would say this is a must watch movie for anyone who has children in that 5-10 year old bracket. Mr. Brown loved his wife very much (7 kids in about 10 years.) His children are precocious and have been running off nannies. Finally the facially blemished Nanny McPhee shows up at their doorstop and takes charge of the household, using a certain amount of magic.<br /><br />Mr. Brown maintains his home because of money supplied by his wife's aunt. She insists he must marry by month's end or lose the money. So he contacts Mrs. Quickly, (this is another story where names have meanings) and asks her to marry him against his children's wishes.<br /><br />The children, who first view Nanny McPhee as an adversary, change their point of view to accept her. Emma Thompson stars in this movie as well as wrote the screen adaptation for herself (must be really getting tough to get roles). The acting was good and this is a movie adults will enjoy watching with their children.<br /><br />By modern standards, I think it smokes Mary Poppins.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't often write reviews, but I had to in this case. Wool is one of those books whose underlying story is so unusual and enthralling that it sticks with you for a long time. Probably forever, it's that good. The incredibly unique world that Howey creates is such an exciting change of pace, I can't believe I just stumbled upon it here on Amazon. I can't wait to read the 6th (thank GOD for kindle 1-click)!<br /><br />looking forward to the sand!

B0086700CM|4.0|I love temple run because it is very addicting to get a new highscore and to get all of objectives.  I also like how the red coins are worth two points and the blue coins are worth three points.  I like  the power-ups to get a lot of coins!  There are different characters to unlock and I switch to I like to use the best.  I think temple run ia awesome!!!!!!!!!
B000NTPDSW|1.0|This \\"Coppola Restoration\\" Blu-ray is NOT 1.85:1 as it should be, as Amazon says it is, and how it was originally released, theatrically.  Instead, it was pan and scanned to 1.78:1 (16:9) to fill HDTV screens without a small but necessary letterbox.  Therefore, part of every frame is cut out. It is inexcusable for this landmark piece of American film history. Amazon has the spec wrong, and the packaging conveniently does not list the aspect ratio. For all of the reviewers who don't notice or complain about this, maybe they have never viewed these discs. Unfortunately I did not notice until it was too late to return it, otherwise I would have. The video quality is also poor for the hype of it being the \\"Coppola Restoration.\\"
B007J5PAN6|5.0|Bought the deluxe version which appears to be manufactured in Malaysia.  This review is strictly on the quality of packaging and quality control.  All I can say is the packaging is TERRIBLE!  Both discs are so tightly stuck inside the paper cardboard packaging and it is impossible to remove it without smudging it with your fingerprints, and to top it off Disc 2 was stuck inside and when I removed it, there was sticky adhesive residue on the shiny side! Ugh!  The 5 star rating is given to Jason's performance, but I wish there was a separate rating for the packaging.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good game for sorting thru recognition. I usually dont get skunked, but most games  surprise me when I win. They seem like its over then suddenly its solved.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was given the 3 books by a friend to read.  This first book started out okay then it got ridiculous Miss Steele had orgasims at the drop of a hat, the repeated sex between her and Mr. Grey were the main topic through the book sounding like the author was a craved sex happy teenager who's only thought was sex.  Where was the story content in this book.  I love to read but this was a huge disappointment.  I finished the book because I wanted to see what the other 2 would lead too.  If I wasn't given these books to read I would have never purchase the next two.  I understand she is a first time author but didn't she have someone read this book and tell her how stupid it was.  If she would of made only one book out of the three and cut most of the ridiculous sex out it would of been much better reading. I have to say the second book was not much better then the first, but at least the third book Fifty Shades Freed had some story to it. [[ASIN:034580404X Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set]]
0345803485|5.0|Wow, this set of 3 is amazing. Never read anything like it. I was hooked about mid way through number 1.  I am on 3  and they just get better. Love Ana and Grey.

0385340990|5.0|After reading the book, Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, I've raved about it to all of my frinds and to the staff at my local library. Too read about what those strong and caring folks did without during WWII while under Nazi Occupation, is hard. They actually did make a pie from the potato peelings,using the mashed potatoes and sugar beets for a filling.  They did without many staples, eggs, sugar, flour, milk and...at the end of the war, hardly anyone had shoes to wear. They had officers who were right there, watching their every move and enforcing a curfew every night.  For five years they took the best of everything for themselves and left the islanders, wanting and almost starving. I've already bought one of the books for a sister and will buy more of them as gifts.  There are many funny episodes throughout the book and it not only enlightens but brings enjoyment to the reader. A fantastic book - so well written!!

B000P12LWY|1.0|I was expecting something on par with \\"Elizabeth\\" (Cate Blanchett), but was sadly disappointed. ..No lack of acting skills in \\"The Tudors\\", but the plot and characters are so superficial I had a hard time maintaining any interest.<br /><br />Jonathan Rhys Meyers is obviously an accomplished actor, but I think a poor choice to play Henry VIII. ..I would have prefered someone like Jude Law or Clive Owen, etc. ..Also, I don't find the character, Ann Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) exceptionally attractive, which makes it hard to buy into Henry's infatuation with her. ..To each his own.<br /><br />And the biggest problem I have with this series is the total lack of any likeable characters. ..Henry VIII is so loathsome, I found myself hoping for a natural disaster to wipe out Henry and all the creepy people in his royal court.

0307887448|1.0|Good science fiction always asks you to accept a few fantastical premises. Ready Player One certainly does. Start with your standard dystopian setting: near future, climate gone mad, mass unemployment, everyone struggling for a living. But somehow, despite food and energy shortages and everything else, a significant portion of the population spends significant chunks of time escaping reality in a massive multi-player on-line gaming realm called OASIS. It's a mix-up of World of Warcraft and every other multiplayer game ever - plus every popular gaming, TV or movie franchise ever: it's a game that lets you create worlds, and people have. There is no novel, TV or movie series so obscure that someone hasn't set out to re-create it in OASIS. And this is not exactly surprising as the game itself was created by a hard-core gamer and pop culture geek, James Halliday. It's his death that sets the book in motion, as he announces, via a recorded will, an in-game quest for which the real-world prize will be control of the OASIS (lifetime supply of Wonka chocolates, anyone?). Since the game accounts for a significant chunk of what's left of the world economy, this is a Big Deal. One the standard dystopian Evil Corporations cannot ignore.    Along comes Wade Watts, OASIS player and the novel's hero. You know from page one, almost, that he's going to win the quest, defeat the Evil Corporation, blah blah woof woof. But he also manages to make real-world friends, earn enormous amounts of money, get serious respect, win the girl, lose weight and get fit all by playing a computer game. Is this the ultimate nerd fantasy or what?    And he does this because, despite being only a teenager, he somehow managers to soak up all the pop culture trivia, including hundreds of books, thousands of hours of television and a lot of music - all mainly from the 1980s - so beloved of the game's creator - a man quite a bit older than him. (There's a list of all the pop culture references on the book'sWikipedia page.) OK, the boy is a genius - we're told that - but this is really something ...    And, frankly, it's unbelievable. I couldn't swallow the various premises of this book and I certainly couldn't accept a teenage boy basically duplicating the life experiences of his idol and doing it when electricity, water and food are all in short supply. Cline gets around the limitations of the scenario by having Wade make his way to one of the few real-world oases left, a town utterly dependent on OASIS' parent corporation for its existence and therefore assured of the basic comforts. That Wade does so by evading the surveillance of said Evil Corporation is yet another of the book's too-far stretches.    Ready Player One is basically fan fiction that got loose and got a publishing contract. It's entertaining, yes, but it's self-indulgent, bordering on wankery. That they author has recently announced a competition himself, centred on easter eggs in the book and with a replica Back to the Future DeLorean as the prize ... well, it doesn't endear him or the book to me.    [...]
B0086700CM|4.0|I like temple run but I think they need to make new courses to run on it gets kinda boring after a while
0385344228|4.0|This book is the story told from a fathers point of view of how far you would go for your child? Jacob's father is the narrator and the AD for the town of Newton when a young boy is murdered. The story is timely with bullying and the use of of the internet in the lives of today's teenagers. I enjoyed the book and while I could not put it down I was wanting to hear more from the other characters like Jacob's mom, Jacob himself and even some of the other characters in the book.<br />I felt like I was never able to get a full picture of what jacob or his mother is put through during the book. With that said, the book does not disapoint.

B007SGM084|2.0|I could have sworn that there was a lawsuit that caught Apple working with publishers to fix the price of E-Books and how great this was going to be for the E-book world. Well now we get a title in a trilogy that cost more for the download than it does for the paperback version of the book. What I find funny is that Amazon compares the price of the E-Book to that of the Hard Back copy of the trilogy. So it looks like you save but you dont because with the kindle you only have data not paper or ink. I feel that there is still a price fixing scheme in place but I think that it involves the book publishers not so much Amazon. Of course the fix is to stop buying all books get a library card, and check out the book for free, heck you could even give a couple bucks a month to library and they would appreciate it.
B003FSTN52|5.0|I don't usually purchase full seasons of TV shows I've already watched, mostly because of the expense. But I've so much enjoyed The Good Wife, I decided I had to purchase.

B0086213XW|5.0|This is the most visually compelling movie I've seen since \\"Submarine.\\" Admittedly this may be because I coveted all of Michelle Williams' wardrobe throughout, am in favor of twee aprons, and now desperately want my town to have a carnival ride that turns the lights down to hits from the 80s. It could be written off as hipster candy--a love triangle in Toronto among late twentysomethings--were it not for its watchful and heartrending take on life, mostly rendered through Williams' natural and exquisite performance.<br /><br />The story lingers on her every emotion, which is not to say it's self-absorbed and navel-gazing (I find \\"Garden State\\" unwatchable). Williams doesn't play a manic girl whose problem can't be explained, so let's chalk her up to be bipolar. Rather, she has problems with \\"the gaps in life\\" --one casualty of which is her 5-year marriage that is comforting and loving but not completely fulfilling--meaning that she is a perfectly normal person, albeit one who doesn't yet know what she doesn't know. But she takes steps to find out.<br /><br />The rival for her attentions turns out to be her neighbor, whom she has immediate chemistry with, compounded by her unavailability and yet ever-present near physical proximity. Their scenes together are charged, set to a great soundtrack, but not idealized--if you like these people a smidgen less, you may cringe at the words actually spoken. She can be coy and needy; his characterization actually seems to get thinner and thinner as the movie goes on until he is literally a shadow. But I think it speaks to the truth of the movie that he could be anyone. It's maybe not the partner you're with that makes you stay in or leave a relationship but the timing.<br /><br />This movie could have ended 30 minutes earlier to render a typical ambiguous but hopeful indie resolution. But to its advantage, I think, it continues forth and plays out to an ending steeped in the nature of real life.

B000002JSN|5.0|This is Led Zeppelin at their best!!  Zeppelin at their peak!  Creativity off the chart.  Not one bad song on this album.  There is straight up hard rock (Custard Pie, Wanton Song, Sick Again). Blues (In My Time of Dying). Folk and Acoustic (Bron-Yr-Aur and Black Country Woman). Psychedelic (In the Light).  Pop (The Rover, Houses of the Holy, Night Flight).  Funk (Trampled Under Foot).  Just plain old fun (Down By the Seaside, Boogie with Stu). Ballad (Ten Years Gone).  And KASHMIR!!!!!  The epitome of Led Zeppelin. If I was going to take one album to a desert island it would be Physical Graffiti.  Cannot say enough about it!!  One of the best albums of all time, period.

0307592731|1.0|I almost returned this book when I saw the Oprah sticker on the cover. Unfortunately, I took a chance on it.  Other reviewers have gushed over this being the story of a \\"transformational journey.\\"  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Ms. Strayed failed to learn even the most basic rules of backpacking; proper footwear and a light pack.  She appreciated little of the natural beauty of the wilderness, instead subjected the reader to constant whining due to her unpreparedness. She seems to have learned nothing from her promiscuous sex life and hardcore drug abuse.  Spiritually, she appears just as empty at the conclusion of her hike as when she started. The passage about shooting her mother's horse in the head multiple times to \\"put it down\\" was horrific, cruel and criminal.  She writes of the execution of a family pet as necessary because they couldn't afford a vet to perform a humane euthanasia. Did she not have the capacity to earn a few extra dollars?  If you are looking for an annoying and depressing read, this book is for you.
B00845PV16|1.0|I absolutely loved the first Ghost Rider movie, and still do, but this sequel is just so, so sad. From the storyline, to the special effects, to the acting, even by Cage, who is usually so good.<br />Overall, just very poor and very sad, if they had a rating for minus-something, I'd have chosen that.

B007C3TVEY|1.0|This has to be by far the worst movie ever and that's including Whoopi Goldberg movies. I don't know what retarded hipster made this movie but I've seen better movies made by 3 year holds with a camera phone. I literally rather chew on cardboard then ever be forced to watch this talentless dry movie that sucks more than a shop vacuum. Ugh sheer disappointment. The dog didn't even wanna stay in the room for this one. And he likes bad movies.

B004LWZW24|1.0|looks like a good movie halfway thru but then towards the end it becomes completely idiotic. i could handle some of the stupid things  that this movie threw at me but the end was what made me rate this movie the lowest i could possible<br />it has no true ending in my mind, just a slap to the face ........dont watch this movie unless  you want to waste almost two hours of your time and some money...please save yourself some grief from watching this movie and just rent something good instead.........like p2 or .....well anything

0756405890|3.0|This novel was well written, had very quirky and interesting characters, and I'll admit it did leave me wanting to know more, but I would not exactly call this the best book I have read.<br /><br />The whole novel is about a man telling about his past. That's right, the whole novel. A part of me wanted to put down the book, because after all, why would I want to read about things that have already happened? But there was another part of me that was hoping that this was all for something; that by the closer I would get to the end of the book, the closer I was getting to some sort of edge-of-the-chair-sitting ending.<br /><br />And well, I was sort of right. It was leading up to something.<br /><br />Another book.<br /><br />Can you say disappointment? That's at least my feelings with how this book went. Of course, if backstory is your thing, then you'll adore this book.
B0044DEAUA|1.0|Don't waste your money on this device. I ordered it to replace the Jabra that I had for 3 years. Should have stayed with the Jabra line. This little device only connects half the time when I am getting in my car. Add to the fact that the sound is never loud enough and the person you call can hardly hear you and you have what amounts to a really cool looking paper weight. Look elsewhere.
B0084BM7GW|5.0|I just watched the DVD Release on Facebook and this was well worth the wait!!!  I finally got to see Duran Duran in concert last year (twice) after being a full fledged Duranie for 30+ years and these guys did not disappoint!!!  This DVD captures the excitement of their live shows and takes you right back.  It gives me such a thrill to think back to all those who said DD was a flash in the pan and would disappear.  Not only did they not disappear but they are back and sounding better than ever!!!  I was one who never really cared for Andy Taylor and after seeing this I can say without a doubt that Dom Brown is a great fit and has become a true member of the band!!<br /><br />I can't wait to get my hands on this so I can watch it anytime I want!!!  Now I just need to figure out how to see them live again!!!

0385040253|5.0|For all the rope there is in the world that needs a knot, you would expect Ashley's to be much more broadly recognized.  To catagorize it as a book of knots is far too limiting since it covers  nearly every concievable manner to manipulate fiber stranded material across many trades and applications.<br /><br />Written from the perspective of a man who apprenticed on a square rigged whaling bark, where rope was a raw material and knots were tools,  it lacks the 21st century approach.  Since he is writing from that era, there is nothing on synthetic materials nor are there any photographs.  His line drawings do a fine job of conveying the ideas he is presenting, with the possible exception of a few of the very complex knots.  But what it lacks in modern parlance and presentation  it far more than makes up with richness and depth.<br /><br />Even though it starts out simply, it is not a book for beginners.  It would be better to start out learning a dozen or so knots and getting the feel of line in your hands as a foundation and then move on.  That way, Ashley can provide you with page upon page  of delight as another lightbulb goes on and you add to your knot vocabulary.<br /><br />An interesting transformation occurs as you continue to dip into this book: it becomes less of an instructional manual and  more of an epic journey that began thousands of years ago; one that you are invited to recreate with the knots that you tie.  Dive into Ashley's and you will never look at a piece of rope, line, yarn or twine the same way again.
B00846REIS|5.0|After reading this book, I agree that there are a lot of strong similarities to FSoG. So what?  Obviously, it is a theme that women are enjoying or the book wouldn't be so popular. I have said this in other reviews, but it is worth repeating...if you don't like this kind of book, don't read it. The storyline is similar, but the style is very different, as is character development.  I , apparently like lots of women worldwide, enjoy a story where the unlikely happens and people find love. I don't find it so hard to believe that two talented writers had similar concepts of what it looks like, and I've just read a third that is very similar by Kristen Ashley-another talented lady who sees merit in the same sort of storyline. I think Bared To You was fabulous, and I can't wait for the sequel.

B000FC10MU|5.0|Wow! I'd never read Neil Gaiman before and, based on the name, I probably wouldn't have necessarily picked up this book. As it turns out, a coworker lent it to me at work, and I found ,myself unable to put it down, reading on my breaks. When I got home in the evening, I realized I'd left it at the office, and I wanted to keep on reading so much, that I just bought the kindle edition and indulged some more.<br /><br />This story is new and old, different and mainstream, emotional, and spiritual, and physical, it talks to you about what you want to hear and what you'd rather not know, the characters are there for the knowing, the touching and the taking. I was transported, within the book and within myself. Everybody should read it, it really is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This was a purchase I made as a birthday present for someone I do care giving for, the movie arrived in less than 3 days, it was an overall success when presented as a gift.

After you are finished with Beautiful Disaster, pick up the Providence trilogy, they are so good!!! :) I hope she is writing more and more because I am in love with her writing!! :)
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Unmemorable but sweet, amusing, light read, not expensive so I paid for what I got.  I would probably not but another book by this author.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|This is not a religious book full of God like perspectives. In fact it may force you realize that God and perspective are one and the same. A book about breaking rigid thought patterns and interesting ideas with extraordinary information about the mind, body, soul, and the use of the universe as a guide. Humans can sometimes walk around awake while ignorant in voluntary sleep. Reading this book is the alarm. Wake up. A tremendously helpful book.
B0017R5UA0|5.0|This album is unique and worthy of your time, at least if you are at all interested in music with incredibly unique melodies and beautiful vocal harmony. When I play this album, I feel like I have been transported to an alternate world of lush beauty, where electronic music is unknown, and music instead has progressed from the folk music of the past into a strange and fascinating hybrid. More than anything, there is mystery and wonder that haunts me when I listen, and I want to keep listening, to keep inhabiting that world. The lyrics are definitely strong in every track, and remind me of a more ambiguous Simon and Garfunkel. Track by track, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Sun It Rises: 9/10 Despite a rather awkward beginning, the band introduce us to the gorgeous and otherworldly vocal harmony that immediately draws you in. A worthy beginning to the album.<br />White Winter Hymnal: 9.5/10 The big hit, which put Fleet Foxes on the map. It's a song that is so catchy and folksy that you almost overlook the dark lyrics about falling and bleeding in the snow.<br />Ragged Wood: 8.5/10 This song is great. Catchy introduction, with haunting melodies that arrive halfway through. It's medley that doesn't get old due to it's unexpected ventures into mysterious guitar melodies, only to return to the familiar and happy.<br />Tiger Mountain Peasant Song: 9/10 A winner, with dark lyrics. Musings on death sink into a confused confession of becoming something unexpectedly hideous.<br />Quiet Houses: 7.5/10 A breezy and simple love song. Disappointingly boring lyrics, and slightly repetitive sections do not ruin the track because the band's musicianship holds it together.<br />He Doesn't Know Why: 8.5/10 A great song, with sincere, ambiguous singing, but with a growing positive intensity.<br />Heard Them Stirring: 7.5/10 The wordless \\"aaahhh\\" and \\"ooohhh\\" singing coupled with the growing intensity of the guitar make for a highly listenable song, and the layers and deep drums combine for a great song.<br />Your Protector: 8.5/10 The flute in this song provides a mysterious overtone, and the conflict in the chorus and harmony is a masterful combination.<br />Meadowlarks: 8/10 A slow, thoughtful ballad that grows into haunting and unexpected harmonies. An excellent slow song that is extremely impressive.<br />Blue Ridge Mountains: 9.0/10 One of my favorite songs on the record. It is the pinnacle of folk combined with the masterful and mysterious melodies the band is great.<br />Oliver James: 7/10 A fairly disappointing end to a great album. I like sincerity of the singing, but the hymn-like style is undermined by Robin Pecknold's flat singing. Doesn't ruin the album though.<br /><br />Overall, an incredible album. Buy it, if you're at all interested in mysterious music that marries older folk-rock with fascinating new melodies and harmonies.
0061122416|5.0|One of my favorite novels. I think it would be very helpful if this book is a summer reading during high school.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|It seemed that the intent of the movie was to portray Lady Thatcher as little more than a power-hungry and selfish person who, as a conservative, was out of touch with everything and everybody.  Rather than focusing on her accomplishments or place in history, most of the movie is devoted to alzheimer's disease.  Kudos to the makeup artists.  The rest was very disappointing.
0767802519|3.0|I got the DVD in an orange bubble-envelope, securely taped shut and appropriately sized, but the DVD case itself was coated in a cracked plastic heat-wrap, and the disc wasn't secured to the inside of the case, and had some smudges on the Widescreen side.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|What could possibly happen next? Cloverfield. Directed by Matt Reeves and produced by J.J. Abrams. If you watched this in the theater you probably remember the experience. The amount of hype was monumental. The advertising campaign execution was brilliant.  That being said, the original way of viewing this film, is the best way. That original way being: not knowing anything about what is going to happen. In the tradition of the creators I will explain without spoiling. Cloverfield is a story of madness and chaos. The insanity unfolds in front of your eyes one fast paced step at a time. To sum it up indirectly: New York City is under attack. This clever film puts you right in the middle of it. How would you react in this situation? How would your friends react? How would the world react? Throughout the course of this movie, you might think about these questions. As in many great psychological thrillers, it is what you don't see that haunts you long after the movie is over. Many film goers are on the fence about this one.  Certain elements of it are amazing. Mystery, Tanks, guns, explosions, scares, and of course: girls. There is a something here for everyone.
0545265355|2.0|Every body was talking about The Hunger Games and how much they liked it, and how this is gonna be the new book series that will mark a whole generation, so I had to see what was all the fuss about. I bought the first book and I've read it, but I did not felt that amount of excitement or blood-rush while reading it. Nevertheless, I found some parts of the book quite boring.<br /><br />But, I always say that you have to get to know something (or someone) before you judge it, so following my own rule, I decided to continue reading the series and read Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I actually liked Catching Fire the best of all series, because it was promising something and I really looked forward to starting the third book, which ruined every little respect I had for the series and the author.<br /><br />I would dub this series by Suzanne Collins an awful attempt to make a crossover between the Harry Potter series and the Twilight Saga, picking up the best of both worlds. The only problem is that she epically fails in doing so.<br /><br />I admit, the Hunger Games series have their moments, but all on all, I do not think that Collins is a good author. I think that her writing is pretty shallow and situations and moments that could have been epic and memorable and give you the goose-bumps were just - empty and without feelings.<br /><br />When she tries to describe Katniss' pain on several occasions, she does that, but you can't feel her feeling for her main character which makes her look artificial and fake.<br /><br />Collins puts politics in her series, a lot of deaths (beside the unimportant ones, there are few \\"tragical\\" deaths of more or less important characters), self-sacrificing main character and friends who are willing to sacrifice their lives for their friends - things we have in the Harry Potter series. But, Collins is NOT Rowling (she just hopes she can be) and even (I'll say it, although I know how bad it sounds) stealing some of the sentences that Rowling actually uses in her beloved and most celebrated series, can not put the spirit and the feeling in the Hunger Games trilogy that a reader has while reading the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />And on the other side, we have a confused girl, thorn between two boys, trying so hard to make up her mind and make the important decision and choose one of them (although we all know from the first book who that is) - the main theme in the Twilight Saga by Meyer. The only difference between Collins and Meyer is that Meyer actually wrote Twilight because she believed in it and you can feel the connection between the author and the characters and how much she loves and cares about them, even though the plot and the story by itself are pretty lame. With Collins we have the complete opposite - she has a good story and a plot she follows, but she does not love her characters.<br /><br />On the themes and ideas the Hunger Games trilogy shares with the Battle Royale by Takami I'm not even going to start, because we all know where she stole the original idea from.<br /><br />I do not hate the Hunger Games trilogy, nor Mrs. Collins and this is not a haters review. I just want to say that there are so many great series out there who are really worth the public attention, and somehow books like the Hunger Games trilogy have it lucky on the bestselling lists. These books are not good books. Just books who actually sold very very well.

159102594X|4.0|This book was a fun, quickish type read.  For one thing, Joe Abercrombie is funny.  Not so much laugh out loud funny as clever funny.<br /><br />I haven't read the second and third books yet, so without knowing the ending it seems to me this first book is mostly plot/character setup for the trilogy.  Abercrombie does a great job of making his world vivid, believable, and unique without beating you over the head with it.  Mostly he accomplishes this by mastering the old \\"show me, don't tell me\\" (and using the bias of each character in the first person format).<br /><br />Some of the characters seem a little cliche, but in some ways that is what Abercrombie exploits-- he takes a cliche character but writes about their story in a very unique way.  I noticed other reviewers mentioning that the fight scenes are written really well-- I agree with that, and I will add he does a great job of making the fighting unique by having a play-by-play type description during which he truly shines.<br /><br />I just ordered the 2nd and 3rd book now, so I'm in for the trilogy after this start.

It is one of our preferred toys for riding in the car as it will keep her occupied.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I expect that Sherlock Holmes:  A Game of Shadows is the second film of an intended trilogy.  Leave us hope the final of three films gets to a point fast and stays there.  Certainly, Robert Downey, Jr., Jude Law and Jared Harris are craftsmen who can manage tight work.  (Indeed, for Robert Downey the senior, take To Live and Die in LA in which this staunch man appears.)  The public domain character Sherlock Holmes can be taken as Basil Rathbone, Robert Downey, Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch.  For Sherlock Holmes films without a twitch of computer generated imagery, the Rathbone series.  For overmuch CGI, the Downey series.  For in-betweens, the Cumberbatch series.  There's also the Jeremy Brett CGI-free BBC Sherlock Holmes.  For Robert Downey, Jr., head to head with Tommy Lee Jones, take US Marshals.  Head to head with Val Kilmer, take Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.  Pretty much both, get to the point and stay there films.<br /><br />Here I submit, as a retiree, to ample films viewing while wheeling an exercycle.  Not a moment sedentary and refreshments are at hand.<br /><br />Clint Williams

B0018PJEYY|5.0|This is a great album. I am amazed by the difference that a good remastering can make. The original Moody albums had some of the muddiest mixes of that era so this a treat. It also includes a nice booklet with photos, lyrics, and substantial liner notes for Moody aficionados.
B008H5J510|5.0|Adorable movie.  Lots of fun.  I saw the movie tonight with my 6 year old daughter and she was enchanted.  The music is great and the back story is wonderful. Lots of great energy . I am getting this DVD for her 7th birthday.  I am a new Katy Perry fan.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie is pretty awesome!  It features real Seals not actors!  The movie is definitely worth owning and I plan on buying it soon.  The action scenes were amazing and you do get a sense of what the Seals actually go through in real life.  The fears, the hopes and dreams are captured in this film.  It is a patriotic movie for sure.  If you can set aside your differences if such a film makes you feel uncomfortable you will enjoy this movie!
B005LAII1C|4.0|because the big jokes are spoiled, you've seen them. But enough remains, the smaller laughs to hold the viewer. Boston looks good. It is worth the time.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Pretty amazing app. Lots of features, including different views of the moon, see the phases for a whole month, information about the moon and much more. No GPS on the Kindle Fire but I just had to put in my location.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I've had this case for a few months now and I am still very happy with it. Its a very good solid case. The corners hold the Kindle in tightly and there is no danger of it accidentally falling out of the case. If you're looking for a well made, no frills case to protect your Kindle Fire you can't go wrong with this 1.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|It started out pretty bad.  But every time I thought, \\"Well, at least it can't get any worse,\\" it managed to do just that.  With the exception of Tom Cruise (sorry, but I can't stand the sight of him), I like most of the actors and actresses in this movie.  However, there's a reason that most of the actors and actresses in this movie don't typically star in musicals -- they can't sing.  I winced.  I groaned.  I put my head back on the seat and closed my eyes.  I couldn't wait for the torture to end.  Fortunately, my friend spilled a large soda all over herself, and we had to leave about twenty minutes before it ended.<br /><br />Personally, I can't figure why they'd cast Tom Cruise in the lead role in the first place.  Sebastian Bach or Jon Bon Jovi would have been better substitutes, IMO.  Sebastian Bach had the lead (stage) role in, \\"Jesus Christ, Superstar\\" for a while and Jon Bon Jovi has acted as a secondary character in many films -- they both can sing, they're both pretty hot, and they both were part of the 80's rock music era.  Tom Cruise?  80's rock star?  Really?  Ew.<br /><br />I originally thought this would be like the movie, \\"Rock Star\\" with Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Anniston, which I kind of liked.  I thought it would be a movie with a kick-a$$ soundtrack of original recordings as opposed to covers by people who can't sing.  And EVEN IF the singing had been better, I still would have perceived the movie as a spoof, mocking the 80's music era.  What can I say, except that it was my friend's turn to choose -- I wanted to see, \\"Brave.\\"
B007R3AZNK|2.0|There are not too many guitarists that can hold a stick to Bonamassa but for some, his continued efforts to become more slick and become more hit and pop friendly is wearing somewhat thin. But certainly as his popularity grows, this concern will mean little to Joe since he was disregarded by so many when he was being more true to important music history. There almost seems to be a \\"I told you so\\" mentality at work here, as if popularity and money determine importance in the scheme of things. Deep down, he knows it doesn't but popularity can be an addiction that proves to be too powerful for even the strongest souls. This albulm should send Joe into the realms of pop that he obviously desires and he will be able to kick dirt into the faces of those he feels turned their backs on him, but that happens to many musicians. He wasn't the selected one. But there is one area that places him in select company and that was his decision to use Howlin' Wolf's voice at the beginning of one of the songs, which is similar to what Kenny G did with Louis Armstrong. Oh sure, the pop fans will make nothing of it or even praise it but the fact is, he is stepping on sacred ground that matters to many. At one time, this seemed to matter to Joe too so you cannot just throw this fact away. There is a way to grow your fan base without turning your back on those that came before you. Hopefully in this regard, Joe will look within and not blindly follow those that only care about money and fame.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works like a charm on Samsung Galaxy tablet. No problem. The commands are intuitive. Easy to navigate. Overall, no problems whatsoever.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I'm using this on my Kindle Fire and can access my computer within range of my own wifi but not from anywhere else. Tried from several relatives houses and couldn't get in. Even when I have their password.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/14<br />The devs customer service very quickly left a comment on this review offering assistance. Now that's good customer service. With their help I am now able to get on my computer from an outside wifi, however Splashtop is still unable to \\"wake up\\" my computer if it sleeps while I'm out. So I have to set my computer to \\"never sleep\\" if I want to use it away from home. Hopefully there will be a fix for this soon.<br />Forgot to mention I'm using it on Kindle Fire.
B005LAIGNC|3.0|This movie could have been much better if Hollywood would have put politics away and used more realistic acting.<br />There is no dought how good those pilots fought back in the days and how hard it was for them to overcome and not to be acknowledged.<br /><br />Also too much was put in for a short time frame.
B0086700CM|5.0|um this isn't a fake review so what if the game is laggy it's probably your kindle or whatever device you have. Just play the game my God. all these bad reviews are you serious if this game stupid then why did millions of people play. get a grip if you don't like the game then delete it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the way it finishes the game when you are to the point you win.  I have played better, but not bad.
0062119044|5.0|At times the author uses words that I have never even seen or heard of in my life, sometimes two or three in the same sentence, but it does not detract from this great story. I like the fact that it is not documentary-ish, it does not try to come up with a blanket explanation as to why these types of events occur - the book focuses on this particular incident, this family, this one boy. I had no idea what type of an ending to expect, I was so eager to get to it, and I was NOT disappointed. It was a great read - it's the kind of book that my mind will always go back to, think about, and contemplate long after I have finished it.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Fun puzzle game that kept me entertained for a while. You have to think ahead and be ready to change the direction of the pipe openings.
0439023521|1.0|I have only read the book once, for overall impression, not the two or three times I generally read before posting a review. That being said, I'll probably go back and alter this review after doing the second and third readings.<br /><br />First impression of the Hunger Games . . . blah. The idea intrigued me to start. A tween book that tries to imply something about media hype and morality sounds like a good idea. On the surface.<br /><br />The author has done a disservice to the tween readers she intended the book to be for.<br /><br />1. The writing style. First person is annoying to me because it's a weak POV to write such a supposedly brutal book in. It can be done, but this author has not managed to pull it off. Secondly it's first person present. Present tense is . . . weak writing in any case. It sounds like somebody relaying what they're doing while they wash the dishes and talk on the phone. \\"Okay, now I'm prerinsing dishes. I put the cups in one stack, the plates in another, then I put the silverware in the sink. Next I scrub the silverware and sink the plates into the water.\\" Thirdly, her tense tends to flip flop. Occasionally she slips into past tense, then back to present tense, as though she's not sure what tense she really wants to use.<br /><br />2. Flat characters. Katniss is clueless, apathetic, and indecisive. Most of the important desisions have been taken away from her by circumstance, and the rest by bullying adults. Only a few decisions are made by her, and those tend to end in disaster for others because they try their best to please her, when she's not a person worth pleasing. I found her a very unlikable girl, because of her sullen attitude and her apathy toward anything that does not serve her own interests. Peeta on the other hand is the typical gentle soul, with not a stitch of guile in him. How he ended up with the career killers in the games is beyond me. He's likeable, but he's still apathetic to anything that does not serve his ownpurposes. Gale is probably the most motivated character in the books. His main motivation is to supply food and money for his family, and after Katniss leaves, also for hers. If the author wanted me to care about these characters she fell on her face.<br /><br />3. Alien world. The idea of reality television gone gory is not a new idea. Think Running Man, and the newer movie Gamer. While the books dredge up the idea of the message sent by those movies, it doesn't come close to touching the fear felt when one thinks that this kind of media might some day become the norm. Unfortunately the technology in the books is both alien enough to throw me out of suspension of disbelief, and not researched enough to make it believable. Medicines and technology can do miraculous things that stretch the ability to believe in them. Burn cream that heals after one application, a single injection that cures blood poisoning, magical cosmetics that erase scars and blemishes in a single application. My agrivaton with the technology is not enough to soil my enjoyment of the story, but it is a source of frustration when it kicks me out of the story and makes my mind wander to why or how that could possibly work.<br /><br />4. Political agenda. I won't spend much time on this, as someone else already mentioned it at length. The author seems to be bashing centralized governments, without justifying WHAT about them is so bad. Compound this with the loose resembelance to our own government, and you're left with a feeling of . . .<br />That's it. Just . . .<br />A lot of people are claiming that the author was trying for a 1984esk feeling for the book, but it doesn't even come close. President Snow becomes more like evil Emporer Palpatine from Star Wars as the series goes on. The rest of the Capitol citizens take on the image of cluless, childlike people who have no sense of reality verses fantasy. Compound that with the overwhelming influence of machavelian thought, and you get again, the flat characters with no care for anything that does not further their own goals.<br /><br />5. Romance. I realize that this is after all a tween book, and has some fomula involved that states there must be a love triangle. However, I think this type of book had no business being about romance. The book became frustrating quickly, not only because of the elements mentioned above, but also because the romance angle took too much of the center stage away from the moral questions the book was intended to adress. Add again, the machavelian motivations of the characters for why they chose who they choose, and why . . . and the romance is rendered more about convenience and selfishness than it is about romantic entanglment verses survival verses moral issues.<br /><br />Overall, I'm left with a sense of frustration. As a book for enjoyment, it comes close to being that. Not quite, but close. As a book that tries to bring up hard questions and induce deep thought . . . it falls flat on it's face. I wish I could say that the author did better with the other two, but she did not. Sadly I don't know if it was lack of experience in thought provocative material for older readers, or sloppiness of writing an plotting, I do not know. I just know that I'm disappointed.
B0013J1WKY|4.0|as usual, christina is a great live performer and the price of this video is better than a ringside seat.<br />she has quite matured in appearance but looks sexier.  one reviewer said that she has a \\"bump\\" during<br />this concert but it doesn't seem noticeable when i watched the concert.  christina as always gives<br />a hundred percent performance level rating.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is highly addictive so beware lol!! It puts your. hand-eye coordination to the test.  You can put real money into the game to buy coins, which allow power-ups and more characters, but the purchase is not mandatory.  You can gain coins throughout the run ad well.  I like this option of not HAVING to put money into a game just to be able to get anywhere...but seriously this game is free, amazing, and fun... what do you have to lose?
1583334386|5.0|This is the most informative, compassionate, funny, and practical self-help book I have seen in years!  It would make great required reading in high school if that meant the high schoolers would actually read it. McGonigal's years of experience with Stanford students have helped her tune her presentation to keep it light, readable, scientifically accurate, and most important of all, capable of producing a life-changing experience.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like it. Not violent. Beautiful graphics. Nice replay. Good for kids and  adults. Fun. Easy to learn, hard to master. I have no clue how to double jump, which always hurts my progress.
0143119680|5.0|When I first saw the summary for this book, I skipped over it. I didn't think it would interest me. I was wrong. It was a fantastic read, full of information on subjects that catch a readers attention and possibly, as with myself, want to research some of them. The story is wonderful and not typical. I enjoyed how the charters unfolded and the events. Great read. I've already ordered the second.
032147404X|5.0|although i liked vol. 2 better because it has more advanced techniques, this volume is a good starting point for beginners in photography as well as<br />some pointers for advance photographers who may have missed some techniques.  what is good about these series is its simplicity and the way the \\"secrets\\" are<br />revealed by the author which he states direct to the point without the mambo-jambo convulated texts that you read in other photography books.  each page shows<br />a sample photo and a short text about the photo technique which is short and sweet, easy to understand and quick to refer to later on.<br />most of the \\"secrets\\" here come from his professional friends who shared to him these \\"secrets\\" and for which he sharing to us readers which is<br />a very noble cause in my opinion.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play Solitaire and that's what this is. Although it gives you a score, it is not constantly pushing you to play faster or beat you last score. It is truly like picking up a deck of cards and playing a game, but a bit more mobile.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|The Curmudgeon is a fan of tradition. Whether it's pretending to not be home for trick or treater's at Halloween, or watching people suddenly become massive fans of bands and artists hours after hearing that they'd died, or seeing the latest \\"next Michael Jackson\\" from the X Factor be dropped from their record label, the old philosophy rings true; for there to truly be chaos, we must also have order. Or something.<br /><br />And so, here's the tradition I speak of; for every 50 of my one star name and shame reviews, I always pull back the curtain a little into my own personal tastes and preferences, and give you lucky people FIVE glowing, gushing reviews of the great and the good that makes my black heart beat. This is the first.<br /><br />What's surprising when you scan through the track-listing for this comprehensive Greatest Hits album of R.E.M is not just how many genuine hit records the band have had, but how surprising it is that these songs have become the radio standards that they are now.<br /><br />The almost incoherent babble of Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite somehow turns into a singalong anthem, even if barely anyone knows quite what the Hell Stipe is going on about. A pop record dedicated to Andy Kaufman? A top ten single called \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" actually exists. Then there's the bloody weird \\"Orange Crush\\", and the whip-smart lyrics of \\"It's the End of the World As We Know it\\"? contain an irresistible chorus you could stack books on.<br /><br />R.E.M are as acceptable on drive-time radio as the likes of Bon Jovi, yet the music could not BE any more different. Intelligent, wry, witty, often dark songs and a commercial sound can be a hard trick to pull off, but this two disc set shows that it's a feat R.E.M were more than capable of.<br /><br />So, it's been 30 years. Let's be honest, any band or artist with that longevity are never going to have their most recent material that can sit comfortably alongside their biggest hits. As great as the likes of the Rolling Stones or Lou Reed are, their new songs aren't a patch on the music that got them noticed in the first place. Well, R.E.M have never been a \\"typical\\" band, and it seems fitting that again they defy expectations of what to expect from a group with a three decade career span. The newer material contained here has some absolute gems that deserve as much attention as \\"Everybody Hurts.\\" The gorgeous, heartfelt pop ballad \\"We All Go Back to Where We Belong\\", surely the greatest song Burt Bacharach has never written, and, headache inducing title aside, \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter\\" is a pure rock blast with more life and energy than most bands have in their 20's. Quite from going out with an apologetic whimper, R.E.M were making some of the best music of their careers when they called it a day. Whatever split them up, a lack of creativity sure wasn't it.<br /><br />It was easy to take a band like R.E.M for granted. They've been around forever, right? They'll always be plugging away, touring the world, releasing a new album every few years. It's perhaps only now, when they really have called it a day with this farewell release, you realise not just how unique and brilliant they were, but how desperately we need a band of their caliber now. When you see the charts clogged up with witless, pointless dross that all sounds the same from no-talent chancers like Flo Ride and Niki Minaj, when we live in an age where Nickleback are considered rock stars, 30 years really was not enough time for R.E.M to shine.<br /><br />\\"Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage\\" may be a mouthful, but there's surprisingly little filler here. Casual fans who only know the big hits can discover truly great songs they'd never heard before , but it also serves as a fitting last hurrah for the fans, who will finally have all of these tracks on one collection. It marks the work of a band who never compromised, never sold out and who will go down in history as true American alternative rock icons. Bands of the future - take lengthy notes.<br /><br />And that's it for part one of five. Want to find out what else makes The Curmudgeon tick? We're just getting started...merican alternative rock icons. Bands of the future - take lengthy notes.<br /><br />And that's it for part one of five. Want to find out what else makes The Curmudgeon tick? We're just getting started...

B00447G29S|5.0|I used to watch this every year on cable tv, and every time, I would think \\"this would look so awesome in 3-D!\\"  When we bought our 3-D tv, this was on the very top of my wish list, and let me tell you, it is gorgeous in real 3-D!<br /><br />The movie itself is one of the all time greats, but I know there are people who don't like it because of the way that the people look - very close to real, but not quite, like  wax museum dummies.  If you don't mind that, the story is a flawless tale, describing perfectly all the things children think when they start questioning the Santa Claus mythology.  There is a surrealistic quality to the story-telling that makes the main character repeatedly ask if the events are real or just a dream.  The events bring to mind every Christmas movie and promotion that has ever shaped our ideas of what Santa and the North Pole should be, exactly as it must seem in the mind of a 10 year old.  The music is beautiful, and sends shivers up my spine.<br /><br />Even if you don't care about Santa Claus, 3-D, music, CGI, and are an all-around Scrooge, you can still have fun counting all the characters played by Tom Hanks.
B001JFZ118|3.0|Good movie, horrible sound quality. This is nothing that people haven't said before, but just to elaborate a bit more. The sound cuts in and out. Half the time, you can't make out what the actors are saying and there is no cc for English. The other half, the music and fighting is so loud that you have to turn the volume down. It's cheap to buy, but go for a better copy even if it's a bit more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it rocks it is very fun so awesome awe some cool better than mario better than super Mario hi hi
0385342039|5.0|Like other reviewers, I LOVE all the non-Shopaholic books from Sophie Kinsella.  During my afternoon drives home, I like to listen to these types of books that keep me engaged.  They turn every drive home into a 30 minute episode of show that I can't get enough of.  The book is the first one that I actually took the time to write anything about.  This is my favorite book so far from the author so far and the premise was a recipe for a witty and can't-put-down story!
B004VWH3KI|5.0|A well written book, in an easily readable format. I read through it completely in a couple of days, as I just couldn't put it down. Ray Bradbury is one of my favorite authors. I first read this book in high school, but really enjoyed reading it again. The book deals with such issues as predjudice, greed, ambition, murder and deciet, and all without failing to entertain.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I had seen the reviews for John Carter when it premiered in theaters and so, this was immediately subjugated to the \\"wait for rental\\" status that happens with movies that have extremely tepid previews, weak marketing and mixed or poor critic reviews.<br /><br />However, after having seen the movie, I am rather surprised that it fared as badly with critics as it did.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />My wife and I popped this in on a rainy saturday afternoon not really expecting much.  However, we really got caught up in the story and the great on-screen chemistry between Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins.<br /><br />The real weakness in this movie is the somewhat confusing plot... basically, the celestial \\"bad guys\\" are feeding off of the destruction of Mars, but Dejah Thoris, princess of Helium, is close to discovering a source of great power that can reverse Mars fortune.  The \\"bad guys\\" give a powerful weapon to the leader of the enemy of Helium in order to broker a forced marriage and ultimately destroy Dejah as well as Helium removing the threat for good.<br /><br />Sound confusing?  It is, a little bit... but it is very entertaining.  Other than the slightly confusing back-story my only real complaint is that the movie has a real anti-climactic ending.<br /><br />However, the movie is packed with action, great dialogue and the previously mentioned chemistry between the leading actor and actress that make the story that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />John Carter deserved much better than it got.  It's too bad that the terrible box office showing will remove any opportunity for a sequel.
B0086700CM|3.0|I love this game. It's awesome. But way too hard. Don't really play it often just because of that. Personally,  wouldn't have bought it. :-(
B005HP2JAM|5.0|This is a excellent documentary about the cave paintings in france. The 3d is native and it's a great little interesting set to watch. However they used two cameras hand held in some scenes that means that in some scenes the 3d doesn't come together well.Making bad ghosting problems. BUt the other scenes make up for this as  you get real depth and this is the only way to see this cave ever. No tourists will ever go in there. Warner Herzog who has made some great movies in his day including 'fitzcardo' narrates here. He's from GERMANY and has a accent but he's also a great filmmaker. With credits like 'grizzly man' and 'my best fiend\\" under his belt. The 3d is there to give depth and that's about it. This isn't a underwater experience. Too many 3d fans want things to fly out at them. That isn't the case with most 3d. It's just there for depth. This was shot in hd though and that helps. It's a wonderful show where you will learn things if you want something more then you will be disapointed.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|I had read many reviews regarding this film, and the general consensus was that it was extremely 'boring' and that the plot was 'hard to keep up' with. I wanted to decide for myself so I gave the film a try and surprisingly I was riveted from start to finish. Admittedly, I have never read the book nor seen the BBC version, so I cannot say how the film compares to those, but as someone seeing it for the first time, I absolutely loved it. The plot was actually easy enough to keep up with, once the code names are overcome. My advise is just stay with the story and let the plot unfold.<br />I'm sure most would agree the acting in this film is amazing. It is very subtle, nuanced and toned down. I love the general look of the film too. It looks very smoky and full of browns and greys. I had to take a star away because I thought that a scene near the end was a little bit rushed, but it did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />If you are looking for an action packed, car chasing spy thriller, stay away, but if you love subtleties give this a chance. I'm really glad I did.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love this game!!! Not sure why others have accidentally purchased. My two year old and five year old get on and I have never had an issue. Lots of fun!
B004EPYZT4|5.0|I read my first Conan story in 1972. At the time I was studying English literature at university.<br />Of course Howard's stories weren't 'great' novels. I didn't read them expecting a James Joyce dissertation of the human condition. They were just ripping yarns. That's all I wanted at the moment I was reading them, and that is what I got.<br />Likewise, I didn't watch this movie expecting a meaningful cinematic experience along the lines of 'A Passage to India'. I expected a ripping yarn. I got a ripping yarn.<br />I'm not sure what the folk who have bagged this movie were expecting. Its based on a Robert E. Howard character for heaven's sake, not an E. M. Forster novel.

B000W91RUG|4.0|I watched the show on tv and I found it to be very funny. I decided to buy it and was not let down Big Bang is a funny show. It has some funny science jokes as well funny friends.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Well, what can I say? It's a murder orgy signed Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />If you love samurai action and spaghetti western music, \\"Kill Bill, Vol 1\\" is for you. If not, you will probably consider this to be the worst slapstick-and-slash movie ever made.<br /><br />I admit I was sceptical at first, but I started loving the movie when O-Ren cut off the head of Mr. Tanaka for questioning her ethnic background (well, what would *you* do, huh?). The best character: Gogo Yubari, a sadistic and severely disturbed 17-year old girl working for the Yakuza. How do people even *come up* with characters like that?!<br /><br />The plot doesn't stand closer scrutiny. Let's just say that The Bride is a female vigilante who doesn't want to be sexually molested while comatose, and has a real crush on samurai swords...<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill, Vol. 1\\" is definitely worth five stars. But please don't tell anyone about this review. I'm supposed to be an intellectual, for crying out loud!<br /><br />I took a little souvenir, 57 pretty heads...
B0086DBE62|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this film, after reading several poor reviews, and my kids loved it. Some reviewers bashed it for not bringing much new to the story of Snow White, but it's a kid's movie, and kids aren't comparing it to all the other versions. On its own it is entertaining, well-acted, beautifully filmed, briskly paced, and lets the princess fight and make her own decisions. I enjoyed Julia Roberts in this more than I have in any film she's done in awhile, because she seemed to be having fun playing the evil queen, even relishing it. I didn't think she overdid it for a film like this at all. So overall, a very worthy family film for kids 6-10 or so.
034580404X|3.0|I think the second and third book was actually better than the first. I almost didn't continue reading but wanted to know what everyone was raving about. I think the characters were well written but the story was a bit explicit. To much information on an alternative sex life for my taste.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My book club selected this book for last month's book choice. It was a great read and I completely escaped from the \\"youth fiction\\" that was tagged to it I recommend!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|*Some Spoilers Ahead*<br /><br />This was only my second Stephen King book. I read The Stand (and loved it) a couple of years ago and decided to try this one. The subject of JFK's assassination has always fascinated me, even though I was born more than 20 years after it happened. The setup is great and the action that takes place in Derry is captivating - both the \\"test run\\" for the protagonist, Jake Epping, and his follow-up visit. It's when the story moves to small-town Texas that it loses its momentum and never quite recovers.<br /><br />Because it was never about Epping. He's amiable, sure, and doesn't do stupid things that made me want to throw the book against the wall, but he's as vanilla as you can get. The story is driven by the plot, which is a pretty damn interesting plot once you cut out the pages and pages of love story and the town of Mayber- that is, Jodie. I *live* in small-town Texas, and there's gossip, and evil, and delinquent kids here just like anywhere else. The perfect little town just rang so fake, and the section about it seems to go on forever. This I can't blame entirely on King - surely his editor saw how much filler was there and did nothing to get rid of it. Another thing he or she could have done is to cut out all the references Epping makes about \\"the obdurate past,\\" the \\"harmonics of the universe,\\" etc. How about letting the reader come to his or her own conclusions about hey, what a coincidence this guy has the same name as that other guy from Maine!<br /><br />One thing I will say is that King did a lot of research for this book, and it shows. I have visited Dallas several times and the street names leaped out at me. Recently, I visited the Sixth Floor Museum and was able to see the vantage point from where Oswald supposedly shot Kennedy. It was chilling to see it and then read about it even in a fictional piece of work as if it were happening. I know a lot of reviewers didn't, but I actually enjoyed the passages about Oswald and his family. Instead of this larger-than-life infamous icon, King reveals him to be a paranoid 24-year-old wifebeater with mother issues.<br /><br />The ending, thankfully, wraps up everything in a satisfactory way. But to me, it's too little, too late. Had this book been a couple hundred pages shorter in the Jodie department, I think it would have been a great time-traveling thriller.

B007SSEBCU|1.0|Well if this isn't proof that Meryl Streep could retrieve a scribbled shopping list from the garbage and make it look like The Taming of the Shrew, nothing is.<br /><br />What terrible left wing propaganda, making one of the most iconic women of history look like a narcissistic nut case.<br /><br />Don't waste your $3.99 downloading the video. What a disappointment to students of history who lived in her time.<br /><br />Typical Left Wing Hollywood claptrap.<br /><br />Shame!!!

B005LAII08|1.0|First of all - if you did see the trailer of this movie and think that you know what you are taking your kids to see,<br />think again!<br /><br />It is obvious that the makers of the movie maticulously ommited ALL and ANY violent and super scary scenes that the movie<br />si INFESTED heavily with only to make you believe that it is an  innocent story of a little girl with some personality<br />who simply is trying to change her faith ... with some element of Viking-like raugh dialogues and some bit awkward<br />scenes as a man showing his bottom to others - as it was supposed to make little ones to laugh and parents of them feel<br />at best unconfortable with such an scene.<br /><br />First the report from the audience - the showing we went to was packed to the brim and sold out. During the movie about 1/3 of the parents with small children left the screening with kids screaming murder and in pure horror inspired by violent and sudden scenes bestowed upon them by unexpecting parents who brought them for \\"innoncent story\\".<br />Whoever reminded  - the kids above 5, mostly boys and girls above 6 .. of whom you could see uneasiness on their faces and as parents all around us would check every now and then asking if they want to leave and if it is to scary, tried<br />to show they are \\"BIG\\" kids and can stay and watch this nonsense to the end as it was some sort of badge of bravery,<br />pushing themselves regualrly into the back of the seats on and on and on with every new violent scene and biting their fingers.<br /><br />I would not expect in my wildest dreams that intensity of the bad scenes can be so big and so sudden. The makers of the movie clearly had an agenda to scare all the little ones sensless.<br /><br />It does say PG - and if you think that since your little one previously saw and did not much of other PG movies then please rethink it with an option to leave the theather when you will see your little one not being able to handle it.<br />The problem with seeing this movie in the theather is that you can do NOTHING regarding PG-ing.. your little one,<br />PG stands for Parental Guidance.. and no, you can not provide Parental Guidence in the theather. You could successfully<br />foward the all bad and scary scenes should you watch it at home to shield your little one from the scare but then again<br />I would say that what is left is about 10 minutes of the material that is free of some sort of violence, obscenity and or nudity.<br /><br />This movie is hardly worth watching for little kids as I don't find any value in it, no entertaining value, no intelligent story, no captivating characters that a child can unify with. Just dirty comedy, obscene scenes and the violence of the outmost magnitude for the rest part. Hardly a good kid's movie.<br /><br />We are all used to the fact that Disney just CAN\\"T make a movie that won't try to push some eveil elements in it, for whatever reason - beats me... but this one is way pass the evil elements of your Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and the usual...<br />They are serious about scaring kids, and they want to do good job with it. However the parents are looking more and more often for gentle movies for their kids and programs like Elmo prove that one can make evil-free program and be successful, Disney does not quite give \\"much thought\\" to it.<br /><br />So.. be prepared, you are sitting there with your little one.. minding your own business and not even three minutes into the movie a HUGE, bigger then life bear jumpes at you the full size of the screen, roaring thorugh all of the speakers in the theather and promptly depraving the father of the main character of his lower limb - as the kids watch, in shock and horror..<br /><br />Okay you think.. Disney.. they had to do it,... and as your thought are racing through your mind and you trying to decide weather this was the most scary element, should you take your offspring and leave like score of parents evacuating at this point with their screeeeeeeeeeeeeeming kids, another though enters your mind.. neah.. my kid is a BIG kid, and that was probably the only scene that was scary. Big mistake.<br /><br />So, apparently this is not neither the only nor the scariest part of the movie.. they will pour now reguarly and the wild bears will be jumping at your little ones off the screan roaring and screaming regularly, add to it pretty intense scenes of fights<br />lacking othe cutness of those brawls of the TAngled or How to tame the Dragon.. and you just have really really brutal movie.<br /><br />The dialogues are over the top for the littlest ones and just enoguh confusing for the little big girls who hear words like \\"mother - I hate you\\" etc.. you might really want to think over the idea of watching it with your kid.<br /><br />The nudity.. oh yea baby.. I am not sure how comfortable you are with old and rather unappealing men running around the screan showing their BARE bottoms!!!!!  but you are there for a treat! add to it three little boys doing the very same thing and there you have it.<br /><br />One of the scenes that I personaly object to on many levels is a scenes showing the girl and the bear hounting for fish,<br />showing how they throw spear, how the poor fish is moving on the sharp stick still alive as they practice eating it alive..<br />this is very much in the face of all parents who are trying to show kids gentle handling of nature, animals etc..<br />It is plain scary to very little ones as all of the sudden they see a poor fish that to themis just as much a character -<br />being put on  a sharp spear  - one little girl in the theather screamed loud - mama help the fish~! help the fish! they are hurting it!!! and a second later the fish ripped into shreads sends the kid screaming in horror off the theather!<br /><br />yeah, things like that.<br /><br />And then you have those moments like the house of the witch where you wonder if they possibly could put any more hell-like<br />visions, and then you have a sensless fight with huge black demonish bear in the undercastle dengeon.. and dark forest..<br />as he fights for his life with another bear - up close and personal, super violent fight of two ferocious animals with roars and looks  more like beasts then animals - magic of the screen.. and special effects..<br />then one of them dies right in front of our wide open eyes as we hold to the last thread of hope that this is not how it will end.. there must be something more to it.. the big black bad bear who after all IS a spirit of the guy must be saved by the other bear and not just smashed in front of our eyes with huge stone!!!! so only his paw sticks out...  oh  yeah baby right in front of your little one's eyes.<br /><br />I personally think that this movie is as apropriate for kids under 10 as R rated movie. It is not only full of profanity, and bad language and violence that many of the R rated movies would proudly display but it is also just plain scary, it might<br />scare your kid for life if you ask me.<br /><br />I heard noting but talks between angry parents who to the last moment were hoping for some non violent and good outcome of it and nobody could really get going home with this happy cozy feeling.<br /><br />It is obvious that NO ONE making this movie thought even for a second about kids who will be watching it.<br />Unfortunately we live in the times when they will be making those movies as long as we are going to see them.<br />I for one feel cheated as I would never seat through it knowing what I am for and the miss-representing the trught<br />and real character of this movie trailer should be just illegal.<br /><br />If you plan to go and see this movie - do read ALL possible review checking and focus on the bad ones as the good ones are apparently not telling you what are you going to see, read all parental guides, all one star reviews and then know what it is.<br />I would definitely stay away from it fro anylittle girl under 10, and if you have a boy who can take anything.. then probably<br />7 would be the minimum, I saw many of 7 year old boys still leaving the theather crying so you be the judge.
0307887448|3.0|This is 1980's nerd porn spun into an exciting adventure. Remove all the 1980's references, and it's still an exciting book and a fun read.<br /><br />There were some parts that went 'huh?' at or had to suspend my disbelief quite a bit(and suddenly the protagonist is a commando...?? huh?), which is why I'm giving the 3 star rating, but over all it was enjoyable.<br /><br />A few things irked me, the 'nerds rule' attitude of the author that permeates the book, and some of the philosophy he communicates through his writing, but those are personal grievances.<br /><br />But over all an exciting read, with thrills and lots of fun.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This knife sharpener works very well!  Shortly after it was delivered I sharpened 3 dull knives and they are all sharp now.  It's easy to use the sharpener as the directions that come with it are very clear.  So for under $6.00 I would highly recommend this product.  Not sure how many knives I will be able to sharpen over the lifetime of this sharpener but with the small purchase price it works fine for me.
B005LAII9O|4.0|Oliver Stone returns to his most violent movie since \\"Natural Born Killer,\\" this time focusing on a couple marijuana entrepreneurs and their shared girlfriend.  Chon (Taylor Kitsch in his best movie role yet) is a former Navy SEAL who manages to bring back potent marijuana seeds from his tour in Afghanistan.  His lifelong friend Ben (Aaron Johnson) is hooked on Buddhism and doing charitable work in Africa.  His college degree is in business and botany.  How perfect.  Together they amicably share a love interest in Ophelia (another surprising performance from Blake Lively), who is known as \\"O.\\"<br /><br />As the story centerpiece \\"O\\" is the glue that holds things together.  She's also the chief weed sampler.  The story suggests that this relationship may be a bit more than two boys liking a girl but that question is never quite answered.  Hmm. All is well until they get an \\"invitation\\" to join a powerful Mexican cartel headed by Elena (Salma Hayek).  Saying no is not a good idea, as the guys are exposed to the grisly beheadings of cartel foes.  Elena and her California chieftain (an iniquitous Benicio Del Toro) need the secret to the THC-rich strain of pot so they kidnap poor \\"O\\" on the eve of trio's departure to a secret location in Indonesia.<br /><br />Here is Elena's deal.  She gets 30% of the revenue, $13 million up front and they keep \\"O\\" under wraps for 1 year.  After that, the business venture ends.  Naturally Ben and Chon don't like the arrangement.  Especially Chon who realizes, the ruse will never end.  Added to the fun is John Travolta who plays a senior DEA agent.  He is on the take from Ben and Chon and may be playing all sides.  Stone gets strong performances from his cast in this savage thriller.  I can't help but wonder however why Stone decided to go with two endings.  The first one was fine.
B007UQ5Z1G|3.0|Note: I understand that I will probably get a lot of negative votes based on my score, but try and read it to see where I'm coming from before you hit the \\"No\\" button.<br /><br />\\"Living Things\\" is Linkin Park's follow up album from \\"A Thousand Suns,\\" making this their fifth studio album. After the release of A Thousand Suns it seemed as if the fan base was forever split. There were those that said they had sold out, and there were those who said it's part of a bands nature to evolve and mature. Don't get me wrong I agree wholeheartedly that a band must evolve so they don't make the same album over and over again. However, changing your entire sound is not the way to do that. A Thousand Suns really broke my heart because this was a band I grew up with from the beginning, they helped me through a lot and it pained me to hear something that didn't feel genuine. I tried really hard to keep an open mind with this album and while I feel this album is much better than the last, it still feels a bit stale.<br /><br />Living Things starts with \\"Lost in the Echo\\" not a bad song by any means, but just like A Thousand Suns you hear a lot of electronica influence. Now I'm a man with a very wide range of musical interest, including electronica, but it just doesn't seem to fit. Overall the album plays a bigger role on musicianship than their previous release, but it's still not as prominent as it was in their first three albums.<br /><br />Chester's vocals in the album don't sound as smooth as they have in the past. Whether this is because of age or just years of doing live shows I don't know, but it's obvious they are a little rough now. When they released \\"Burn It Down\\" I wasn't too impressed with it. I felt like it was a step in the right direction after the last album, kind of reminiscent of \\"Minutes To Midnight\\", but it just felt like they were going through the motions. \\"Burn It Down\\" is followed by \\"Lies Greed Misery\\" which has to be one of my least favorite songs on the album. Everything about it irritated me, from Mike's lyrics to Chester's vocals just... ugh.<br /><br />\\"I'll Be Gone\\" comes next and once again is very reminiscent of the sound they created on Minutes To Midnight. It's nothing special, but if you were a fan of MTM then you'll enjoy it. One of the strongest, and shortest, songs on the album would have to be track seven \\"Victimized\\" Awkwardly placed between \\"Castle of Glass\\" and \\"Roads Untraveled\\" this heavy piece of music runs at approximately a minute and 46 seconds. One of my favorites on the album in terms of overall sound and lyrics, but it does suffer from a very lazy chorus.<br /><br />I mentioned earlier my distaste for \\"Lies Greed Misery\\" but it can't beat the overall hate I feel for tracks nine and ten \\"Skin To Bone\\" and \\"Until It Breaks\\" Here are the lyrics in \\"Skin To Bone\\" that just make me cringe: \\"Ash to ashes, dust to dust. Skin to bone, steal to rust. Right to left, left to right. Night to day and day to night.\\" How lazy can they be? I mean that's what majority of \\"Skin To Bone\\" consists of.<br /><br />Then everything about \\"Until It Breaks\\" irritates me. Mike's back to the same \\"hardcore\\" attitude he had in A Thousand Suns. He keeps trying to act like he's some hard ass talking about guns and it gets to the point where he quotes a line from the late great Notorious B.I.G. Then after every verse we have Chester with some lame chorus that makes you laugh because here we have Mike acting hard and then Chester comes in with some soft vocals. I don't know, Mike used to rap with a purpose and a message, I just feel like that's gone now.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Victimized\\" & \\"Roads Untraveled\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 5/10 - As I said earlier I understand a band must grow and evolve, but just changing your sound is not how you do it. Recently I've been seeing a lot of people say that \\"Meteora\\" was just a copy of \\"Hybrid Theory\\" I don't know if we're listening to two different albums, but never once have I felt that. Overall I felt this album was extremely better than ATS, but overall the band sounds stale. I realize that we will never get the Linkin Park from 1999-2003, and that's just something I will have to painfully accept.
0205313426|5.0|Brevity of words delivers impact. The discovery of expression in the brevity of words is a passion for the wordsmith.  \\"Elements of Style\\" is a deep dive into brevity in the fewest words. Creating the 'perfect' sentence and paragraph is my own obsessive-compulsive disorder. Strunk & White is a welcomed partner in my pursuit.<br /><br />The power of the well-engineered sentence and paragraph stands out and is noticed as a construct from out of the writing norm.  Strunk & White has a timeless depth of character rather like the \\"Art of War\\". I find myself re-visiting this thin reference time and again.  Divining just the right element and style to deliver the desired written outcome takes practice and experimentation. Strunk & White provides the essential companion. It may, in fact, be all you need to up your expression quotient.<br /><br />5-stars `I luv it!'.<br />.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a great change of pace from the usual lot of fast, flashy games on android. There are no time limits, there are no explosions, and there's no pressing sense of urgency. What the game does have are beautiful graphics, nice ambient music, and a pensive sort of style that's great for playing a few levels before bed or when you'd rather challenge your brain than your reflexes. I got this when it was the free app of the day, but would be very happy with it even if I'd paid for it.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|It baffles me that so many people have downloaded that other app (FREEdi) , yes I even tried it for a few minutes. The only thing is, TubeMate is a MUCH BETTER YouTube app than any I've been able to find from anyone else. This app lets you watch OR download, pick your resolution, and NEVER causes problems on my device. Videos always play smoothly, sound is clear, search function always brings back just what I'm looking for. The main thing you'll see though right away is the clean looking format and uncluttered look, unlike the main screen of the 'other' YouTube downloader. You won't be disappointed with this one.

B006P0FIGU|2.0|I know, this is an easy target. But the weirdest thing is, the hack screenwriters actually read the source material! To wit --<br /><br />- They get a lot of the names right for minor characters, like Jussac;<br />- In the first duel, Rochefort gets distracted from killing d'Artagnan by Milady's arrival;<br />- Porthos really does sponge off women in order to afford the latest fashions;<br />- Aramis really does sarcastically pray for his enemies after killing them (that's actually in [[ASIN:0199537267 Twenty Years After]]);<br />- Athos really does take Richelieu's written indulgence from Milady by force;<br /><br />-- and so on. And where the movie does depart from the [[ASIN:0486456811 source material]], a lot of its visual invention is actually pretty good. The \\"toy army\\" visuals in the opening make it clear that we're going to emphasize the fun, adventurous part of the story. And the reinterpretation of the musketeers' appearance is quite clever. Porthos as a shaven-headed, leather-clad tough guy is a good way to make him comprehensible to a modern audience. He's supposed to be imposing and brawny, and these visual cues convey that more clearly than the more historical depiction with long hair and lace doilies. Richelieu's contemptuous flattery of the king is perfect. The king himself becomes an effete teenager desperate for the queen's approval. He was much more cruel in the book, but this is a surprisingly good way to set up his jealousy of Buckingham. And, although d'Artagnan is a smirking, self-absorbed jerk...well, that part is actually kind of accurate.<br /><br />So the film-makers aren't talentless. The problem is that they have no respect for their audience. I know, it's Hollywood and that's hardly surprising, but still, one dares to dream.<br /><br />For example, the film-makers wanted their movie to appeal to pubescent boys. I can just imagine the boardroom meeting: \\"All right, people, this brainstorming session will determine our bottom line! If wedon't make our target ticket sales, you hack writers are out on the street! Now, what do the little SOBs like nowadays?\\" \\"Flatulence!\\" \\"Ninjas!\\" \\"Explosions!\\" \\"Hot chicks!\\" \\"Maybe we can make them fly? They did that in [[ASIN:B00005JPNO Transformers]], and kids love Transformers.\\" \\"What about kung fu? That's what they do in those Japanese cartoons, right? Kids love those!\\" \\"All right. Flying kung fu ninja chicks OK with everyone?\\"<br /><br />So, yeah, the good guys and bad guys fly on airships, and they launch explosives at each other, and stuff blows up. Needless to say, this leaves little room for dialogue. In fact, the need for more explosions seems to force the director to cut out parts of the script, so that the remaining dialogue is incomprehensible. So, Milady gets thrown off the port bow, and the bad guys are holding Constance hostage, and then Athos suddenly stops and makes a speech to d'Artagnan about the importance of seizing the day and living in the moment, as opposed to blind loyalty to king and country, whereupon d'Artagnan is motivated to save her. Leaving aside the question of whether this is in character (hint: no), it makes no sense. In this situation, rescuing Constance coincides with the king's interests. And if he meant that her safety is more important than the king's mission, attempting a rescue actually endangers her more. I think that no one read over the script, and this part is only there because that's the part in movies where the aloof guy is supposed to say something to motivate the brash guy.<br /><br />Also, the duel with Jussac is turned into a big kung-fu set-piece in which the musketeers slaughter about a hundred dudes. Contemporary directors have problems with this sort of thing. They mistakenly believe, having played too many bad video games, that fight scenes are more impressive if the heroes are shown single-handedly mowing down dozens of inept, faceless bad guys. In fact, the opposite is true. In the book, this duel takes place between four musketeers and five Cardinal's guards. This number of opponents is sufficient to make the scene immortally gripping, because the guards are part of an elite, some of the best swordsmen in France. A one-on-one duel can be terrifying, as long as the opponent convincingly looks like he knows his way around a deadly weapon. With a horde of opponents, however, there is no chance to demonstrate any actual fencing skill, and the scene is reduced to magical kung-fu decimating incompetent enemies while the camera impotently spins around.<br /><br />There's also some of that jolly old broad humour dealing with d'Artagnan's defecating horse and Planchet's alleged obesity. You know, there is nothing wrong with appealing to pubescent boys. But, during the past 100 years, The Three Musketeers has had no problem appealing to them. The thing is, the novel went for a rise. It appealed to their desire to be smarter, stronger, and more skillful, to their curiosity about the world, and to their fondness for rituals and secrets. The idea of political sophistication was interesting to them. Really, people are capable of more than Hollywood directors think.
B006G2124E|3.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />The Help is a pretty good movie with some funny moments, and a good look at the other side of households in the 1960's. The new Gwen Stacy leads a solid cast in one of the best films of the year. (However, The Artist earned Best Picture fair and square; I think that Viola Davis should have tied with Meryl Streep for Best Actress, though I have not yet seen The Iron Lady, and that Berenice Bejo & Jessica Chastain should have tied with Octavia Spencer for Best Supporting Actress; it has happened before, you know...two actors winning the same award). Throughout the film, I couldn't help but think with regret over how I impulsively ended a friendship I had with a black girl last year who had never been anything but nice to me. And that I sincerely regret.<br /><br />There was one aspect of a scene that I did not like, and it's probably not the scene you're thinking of. Though I will not say what that aspect is, I just had to say that.<br /><br />I give the movie three stars because it profanes God's name by combining His Name wth a mild curse word, thereby making it a strong profanity. Why do film-makers feel the need to disrespect our Creator by profaning His Holy Name? The third Commandment saith, Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.-The Second Book Of Moses Called Exodus 20:7 and The Fifth Book Of Moses Called Deuteronomy 5:11.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for only one viewing.

B005D0RDKW|2.0|I'll keep this brief since most other reviewers have touched on every aspect of what I am going to say.  It's time that bands realize that if they are recording a concert intended to be released on Blu Ray, they NEED to have the audio mixed well and the video quality needs to be top-notch - is there really an excuse for that not to happen?  There is no excuse for anything less, especially if we, the fans, are expected to pay Blu Ray prices.<br /><br />As for the performance, it is painfully obvious that Geddy is incapable of hitting those high notes anymore.  Sometimes I would cringe because his voice was so strained and pitch was so off.  I was perfectly happy with the musicianship of all the guys, but Geddy's (lack of) voice made this Blu Ray a 1-time-watcher for me.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really liked the character's moral/sexual struggle through out this book.  I really don't think it needed the erotica scenes, but they were there....and interesting but could alienate many who are not comfortable with their sexuality or sexual experiences. I got bored with the repetition of the erotica scenes but the sexual tension was fun !  Good read,but not all that it was made out to be unless maybe you are totally bored in your current relationship....in this case you may want to question who you are with if you really needed this book.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|The ideas presented in this book represent a quantum leap in the understanding of why some countries are poor and some others are rich, which is the main question that interests economists.<br /><br />The theses presented are simple, often repeated in the book so that no one misses them and supported with many historical anecdotes, which makes the reading pleasant and enriching at the same time. Unlike most of the books in these topics, they are actually proposing a theory and supporting it and not just combining pompous words which sound deep but that do not advance the knowledge of the reader a single milimeter.<br /><br />Although the ideas have been developed in scientific papers published in the most prestigious academic journals in economics and political science, they spare the reader of tables or mathematical equations. This book is not targeted at academicians but at the general public. If you want a more precise analysis go to the bibliography and check the papers they are building on. Almost all the claims they make in the book are supported by the most rigurous and advanced research. The authors have provided many good answers to important questions that neither economists nor political scientists were able to provide until now and have shifted the academic discussion many steps further.<br /><br />Unfortunately, their theses are way too advanced for the average level of knowledge of most readers. They also go against the most cherished beliefs of most of the professionals of development, economics and political sciences, in general. Their somehow irrational critics are to be understood from the psychological stress of seeing shaken the certainties on which their research was built so far. There is the rumor that Acemoglu was aware of this when he was developing these theories so he kept all these papers in a drawer until he got tenured and only then, once his position was secured, did he published the articles that have brought him to the leading role in economics and that form the backbone of this book. Reading the comments here and in other forums shows the inteligence of his decision.<br /><br />Judging by the comments, historians are also not happy that academic foreigners come from another field and all of a sudden cast light on the phenomena they have been studying for ages without being able to produce these theories by themselves. It is sad to read their unfair criticisms on this book. The book uses different historical episodes to illustrate their theses, but it is by no means a exhaustive account on the history of any particular country or period. Furthermore most of the critics by historians reveal the dramatic lack of scientific rigour of this discipline, valuing more the pure erudition of getting as many (irrelevant) facts right, rather than attempting to build a theory aiming at explaining them reasonably. Few historians seem to be questioning the theories in the book, but rather criticze the fact that they do not mention this or that thing they much like (or they are researching)<br /><br />To sum up, do not trust the noise the book is generating, it is proposing very advanced theories, that many people are not willing to accept because accepting them would represent changing many of their previous prejudices or beliefs, and we all know that some people would rather kill than changing a single supersticion. It does not answer everything, but it definetely brings the understanding of the problem of why some nations are poor and others rich many levels higher.
2070643026|2.0|Okay, I understand that Amazon was probably required to not sell the kindle version of the Harry Potter books directly on their website, but the shop.pottermore.com that they directed me to is just awful!  It's like they took every good, customer-friendly feature that Amazon has, and did the opposite.  I started out eager to read this book on my Kindle, but didn't make it all the way through the process.  I'm disappointed - not in the book, but in the buying process for it.
1878424319|5.0|The author isn't a literary genius, but I was reading for self-improvement and insight, not looking for excellence in writing.<br /><br />The title is the \\"hook\\" to grab the consumer's attention.  The vehicle that the author uses to introduce and teach the four concepts is \\"Toltec wisdom.\\"  There are parts of the book I didn't care about or disagreed with, but the gems far outweighed the parts that were of less interest to me.<br /><br />Ruiz's points are both simple and profound. He presents four practical steps that, if practiced consistently by everyone, would lead to having a happier life and create a better world. Sure, you've heard them before.  Most of us hear repeated information and advice when attending a class, sermon or conference but sometimes it's the timing in our life, the way the lesson is worded or the package it's presented in that gives you a different or deeper insight.<br /><br />This book shows that lessons don't always have to be difficult to read, overly involved or rocket science.  They have to be taken to heart and acted on.
B004W4N55C|5.0|I love this app on my  phone, but it freeze crashes everytime I use my Xoom. please fix this deve lopers!
B003D0ZNM4|5.0|This a wonderful 2cd set from EMI; a compilation of some of Arvo Part's most gorgeous compositions(Summa/Seven Magnificat Antiphones/Fratres/Festina Lente/Spiegel im Spiegel/Magnificat/The Beatitudes/Cantus in Memorium Benjamin Britten/Tabulus rasa/De profundis/Cantate Domino/Beatus Petronius/Solfeggio/Missa syllabica). The perfomers include: The Vasari Singers/Jeremy Backhouse/Choir of King's College, Cambridge/Estonian National Symphony Orchestra/ The Chillingirian Quartet. Part's music has been described as music in the style of a \\"new spirituality.\\" Its true. This is music for the heart and soul that elevates the spirit & consciousness that is gentle, spare, tender; that emits at the center of it: PEACE. I sampled and then purchased this music on Amazon which is offering it at a price that is extremely reasonable. Most highly recommended.
B0088TG252|4.0|I never purchased this movie, but I did rent it.  Denzel makes this movie worth watching, and that's the case in every movie he ever appeared in.  Denzel's character is what held my attention which I suppose is as it should be since he's the star. It would have been just another car chase and shoot-em-up without him.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Can you smell the cotton candy? Feel the empty peanut shells crunch under your feet. I was so transported by this book. Yeah, go ahead and pick apart the plot...blah, blah, blah. But at times I was so swept away. Great escape to a place you have never been before. After this book you'll feel like you have.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun game to play. wish it accumulated your coins though. exciting, and worth it when you have time to spare. def recommend.  clean fun for kids.
B002ZCLH5S|5.0|Such a great movie. Even back in the 80's the special effects are amazing! And to see all the stars in this movie as young men (RIP River) it takes me back. Totally awesome!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I will keep this simple.this app is by far the best Bible app in my view. gives me everything I need and all the different Noyes and highlights plus the ability to stream church and share verses on social media sights.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Title says it all. This is one of the best albums ever recorded. It melts several genres together in perfect harmony. This is the masterpiece of one of the world's great rock bands. Angst, Politics, pain, happiness and plain old fun all rolled into one and always supported by a great backbeat.  If you do not own this then you are not a complete person.
B005EHNMWM|1.0|I was told that this was the album that would rekindle my interest in Jeff Tweedy's music (something I haven't enjoyed since Being There) but, sadly, I still find Wilco lacking.  This album, like pretty much everything since Being There (excluding the Mermaid Avenue albums), is pretentious and utterly forgettable.  What has become of Jeff Tweedy?  Such a sad and boring album from a band that I once thought would be a favorite for a long time, and now I can't even listen to a single new Wilco song without feeling ill. This is simply terrible music. It's such a shame, too, because I know Jeff Tweedy actually does have talent.<br /><br />Wilco needs to go away so maybe Tweedy can find a new sound and put some passion back into his music.
0345803493|4.0|I dont know what is going on....I hate romance .....never liked it because they are so farfetched and predictable. I much prefer a good semi-violent murder mystery but I caved and bought the first one, and then the second. Ms. James must have good PR people because EVERYONE is talking about them. It appears that you either love the books or hate them. I gotta say I like the trilogy so far...very addicting. I'm finding myself very engrossed with the love story. Yes, the book is shocking with all the sex, BDSM, and language (the f word is overused in my opinion) but it is what it is...and it made James a billionaire. I do wonder how the movie industry is going to make the trilogy into movies? I have a feeling it wouldn't get a R rating. I do hope Ian Somerholder gets the part...he's smoking hot like our Mr.Grey. :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game I like having quests to complete.  it is an adventure you should try it thank you
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was very good! Couldn't put it down! I'm not a reader and it was totally an easy read! Now reading book #2! :)
030758836X|2.0|I loved this book at the beginning and couldn't put it down. I found the two main characters to be well drawn and interesting, and wanted to find out what happened with the missing wife. The twist in the middle was fine by me; but in the last third of the book the plot just devolved into a series of completely implausible events. In my mind, that's not a twist, it's just frustrating.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game it is the awsomest game I ever had in my whole intire life and I love it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it was pretty addicting. get it. even though you run out of energy still fin. like facebook games. good game.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Another great collection of songs from Nora Jones, thank you for all the wonderful music!  One of my most favorite cd's this year..
B0077ATSU4|5.0|Excellent movie. Emotions went to extremes. Even after multiple viewings, my wife still cries! Thomas Horn (the kid) should have won the Oscar for best actor. Don't understand why he was not even nominated.
B007MC0IAG|5.0|This new book is amazing! Tons of knowledge from science, in a very entertaining style. The references to the various myths is like spice in the dish. I immensely enjoyed the reading. [[ASIN:B0078XFYDA The Magic of Reality]]
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is amazing! I've read all five books in the Percy Jackson series,and the two current Heroes of Olympus books. Rick Riordan takes you through crazy adventures with characters of remarkable,super-natural abilities. The book is gripping,and once you're hooked,there's no going back. I think these books are great for middle schoolers like myself,though any ready can appreciate this book. I can't wait for the third installment of the Heroes of Olympus series,Mark of Athena. The only downside to these books are the cliffhangers that make me explode!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)  Keep 'em comin',Mr.Riordan!!!!!
B003K16P3M|3.0|I struggled to continue reading and was encourage to continue as the story started building up.  The entire time I read the book it seemed as though the story line would get more exiting but I never saw it get there.
B007FH9GT2|4.0|Yes, I enjoyed this movie. But it could be singularly do to Rooney Mara and wanting her in character to participate in by conceptual art series \\"Boxed\\"! Gorgeous.
B0002W19KQ|1.0|I saw this on TV and loved it, and was excited to finally find it on DVD.  The only problem is that the DVD I received is for Region 2, and I can't watch it.  Very disappointed.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|nice music and soothing graphics. i just wish i could find a way to  choose other songs.  all in all a pleasant experience.
