B001DUDKEY|4.0|Worth watching, as it is based on a good novel.  I enjoyed it and made me think afterward about how people in my own life influence me. Love Jane Austen!
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|I made it through 45 minutes of the dump movie. not sure if its a comedy or drama, but from the first minutes feld like a decsent into boredom. The only reason i watched 45 minutes was because i was stunned that it never ever got interesting and just could believe that anyone would spend money producing such a horrific movie....there isnt one thing good about this movie.... boring. They should be guilty for taking my money... Below the title it says &#34;hilarious&#34; youll need a few cases of wine or beer to crack a smile.
147674355X|3.0|*Potential spoilers in review*<br /><br />I read Hopeless a while ago and had trouble reviewing it. I still haven't quite figured out my issue outside of a strictly personal opinion, so take that for what it's worth.<br /><br />I loved the first half of the story. The characters are interesting, the plot moves forward well, and the way the twist is revealed definitely keeps you wanting to read more. I like that the characters felt real.<br /><br />Then came the end, more so the last few chapters. While I suspected the 'secret,' so to speak, all along, I don't think it was handled well. In fact, I was completely and entirely turned off by Sky's request, and even more by the fact that Holder actually goes along with it. It's completely against his character and just...dirty. I really, really hope it's not something the author hasn't personally experienced (as I wouldn't wish that on anyone), but I did find myself wondering, because it felt offensive to me. I didn't want to read more after that particular motel scene.<br /><br />Regardless, I did finish, and while the ending felt a bit rushed and oddly wrapped up, I do like the final bit with her mother and all the revelations there. I wish that one scene had been cut, and then the book would have been one of my favorites.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|I thought it was going to be funnier and tell more of the many things women have to deal with pregnancies. Loved the dads attitude though.
B008NW67E0|5.0|We really like this group.  It has a wee bit of an Irish lilt to is and it also has religious connotations in it.<br />It's all good.  Love it.

0316228532|2.0|There's a single word that perfectly describes J.K. Rowling's The Casual Vacancy: dismal. Not dismal in the sense of particularly bad, but more in the sense of depressing or dreary. What's interesting is that the word dismal does not actually appear in the book. But just about every synonym for it does. I chose one random chapter and took down all the words that contributed to its dismal feel. Here they are: stupid, nervous, dread, anxiety, overcast, irritated, anger, poxy, bitterness, misery, guilty, frustrated, shock, disappointment, cold, nasty, furious, disgust, horror, dull, dislike, intimidation, rages, frightening, insolence, gossipy, taint and exhausting. That's one chapter. There are lots of other chapters just like it. This book is a one-note symphony, Hogwarts without the magic, an unvaried slog through stifling, never-ending bleakness.
0962477060|5.0|I'm a self taught player. The light bulb came on for me with this book. I was able to &#34;see&#34; how it all worked and my understanding, not playing, lol, improved overnight. i knew EXACTLY where the chords were. I recommend for all beginners and intermediate players.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|this game is stupid you have to pay for the other 2 people to do their hair actually you have to pay for pretty much everything. ALSO it hardly gives you anything to do.
B008602KQI|4.0|I wish this movie had stuck more strictly to the book and covered as much of the story as the book did, but it was still an enjoyable movie. I look forward to seeing the next one.
B004QBWU02|5.0|I found both these items to be very good.the book well that my family history been a BERGOFF. The second one well that took me back to my younger days

0767836286|5.0|This is a thriller with a difference, if only because it does not have a happy ending. Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) is an ex FBI man whose wife Leah (Laura Poe) was also FBI and was killed in the line of duty. They have one son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark). Michael Faraday now teaches Civics at a local college. Coming home from work one day Michael discovers young Brady Lang (Mason Gamble) covered in blood staggering along the road. With Brady in hospital it emerges that he was injured in an explosion that he and his friends created. Once he recovers, Michael, his girl-friend Brooke (Hope Davis) and Grant become friendly with the Lang family. But father, Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins), is not who he professes to be. Through his professional investigative expertise, Michael finds out that, under a different identity, he was convicted of a bombing when he was 16. Michael believes he is now planning another attack. The plot twists and turns and includes the obligatory car chases, but is exciting almost from the beginning as the evil plot unfolds. Just don't expect a happy ending for this one. But it provides a salutary lesson in how extremists work!
B000088E6D|5.0|I especially liked to songs Buble chose to sing on this album...all familiar to an old lady like me.  His voice is so reminiscent of Frank Sinatra's.

B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The game would be better if it provided more of a challenge.  It really just consists of earning money to buy things, which in turn helps you earn more money.  There is no way to \\"lose\\" at this game.  I would enjoy it more if you had more at stake, such as dinosaurs dying if you don't feed them enough, or having to hire enough staff to make sure the park runs smoothly, or designing the dinosaur habitats to make sure they don't escape, or a time limit to reach goals.<br /><br />Having said that, however, the game does provide hours of fun and lets you be creative.  It's just not as fun as it could be.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Great movie with a great cast! The battle scenes were exciting with great special effects. I would recommend this movie.
B007FH9GT2|3.0|Not as good as the original Swedish version and maybe if I had not watched that one (as well as the other movies that go with it) I would have enjoyed this one more. :-)  I do recommend those ones; but be warned, they were made in Sweden and there is nothing held back.<br /><br />But it was still very well done.  The acting was excellent. The story line great.<br /><br />Warning: If you do not like to see people's pets killed, do not watch this; that was the only part that really upset me.<br /><br />However, it is also quite graphic so do not watch with young children.
1426209584|5.0|The photography in this book is amazing.  Having been to Papua New Guinea I know how hard it is to capture these images.  The in depth information on the life of each species is fascinating.  I truly enjoyed this book.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I love the first two books but I absolutely hate the way this book ends. My advise if you like books with fairytale endings DO NOT  READ THIS. I repeat... DO NOT READ THIS
B00846TRHY|5.0|Very cool - great acting and the story is just brilliant.  It is based on a true story and there are even little clips of the real person at the end (which I love).<br /><br />So, if you enjoy up-lifting, inspirational stories, this is one to watch.  I would watch it again (and Gerard Butler rocks too)!
1606995359|5.0|It's amazing how funny these comics are, especially considering they were written over 50 years ago! The colors of the art are extremely vibrant, much more so than the original comic books. This is an amazing collection that every comic book fan should own!

B005M48EKC|2.0|Not a &#34;Tie-in Edition&#34;.... Just the first book of the series.<br /><br />Was disappointed because I thought this book would be about the show, it's not, just the first book in the series.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Always loved Kevin Spacey and can't complain about Gabriel Byrne, Benicio delTorro and the others.<br /><br />Great twist.  Has always been a favorite of mine since I saw it when I was young.  I could definitely watch this again.<br /><br />If you enjoy great acting, a great, twisty, even twisted sort of plot, you are in for a treat and I highly recommend!
1932735410|5.0|I just passed the PMP exam, and I can definitely say that this book helped tremendously.  I have done project management for many years (on small projects), and had taken a series of on-line courses, so I thought I was ready. But when I took one of the practice tests in &#34;PMP: Practice Makes Perfect&#34;, I realized that I had a number of holes in my knowledge. Maybe I would have passed anyway, but with the cost of a retest over $300, I wanted to be sure.<br /><br />Just about everything I needed was here, and the few things I had to look up on-line because they were sketchily covered (e.g. PTA) turned out not to be on the exam. I found it easy to find the info I needed, and the charts and drawings communicated well. There is a density of information in this book that I found very helpful.<br /><br />I spent about 30 hrs studying for the exam over about a week (not counting my original on-line course). It was intense, but the book's style and exams are readable and interesting enough that they did not put me to sleep.<br /><br />Yes, the tone can be off-putting, as it sounds like a very experienced PM &#34;lecturing&#34; a newbie. But if you've really been doing everything in PMBOK, you probably are already certified, and certainly don't need a book.  For the vast majority of PMs who don't do all the PM processes thoroughly (if at all), the tone isn't too far off.  And it's a small price to pay for a lot of info in a dense and accessible package that still maintains a very readable style.<br /><br />Well worth the investment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|No wonder this book is a best seller, it's amazing! It really draws you in, and is full of twist you don't see coming! This book really shows how to have hope in the darkest situations. It will bring tears to your eyes, happy and sad. Must read!

B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I've watched DH for the past 30 years. I can tell you this, DH has always to me is flick that the biggest thrill is to see who John McClain is going to deal with this time. And every time I wasn't disappointed. That really begins from Die Hard I, where you see at christmas time out of no where, a bunch of terrorists took over Aka??? building ( whatever the name is), it forces John McClain a regular NYPD to deal with it single-handedly.<br /><br />DH2 Die Harder, John McClain waiting for his wife at the airport, and terrorists took over airport with his wife about a couple of hours before landing.<br /><br />DH3 with a Vengeance, John McClain became a lousy drunk and got kicked off the unit. Terrorists bombed NY city and request him to come back.<br /><br />DH4, this is actually pretty loose one for me, his retired and his daughter is captured(? I forgot the plot). But then John still managed to beat the bad guy at this own game at the end.<br /><br />Now, the common successful element in the past movies is quite obvious - DH always been a movie that is the enemy who bring up John McClain, its always the big bad terrorists were the center of movie.<br /><br />And it is quite obvious why this movie isn't working because the big bad guy is vague and pretty LAME. The Soviet old guy after reveal himself, he simply have no more input just stand there get caught until his daughter come in rescue what's the thrill to beat a dumb ** like that. And most parts of the movie is simply just about the old guy being trace and while John is tagging along, he somehow missed the injure all, but then he's not pursuing to break the game the Russian is playing.<br /><br />The whole plot in this movie is just rescuing mission, that is it, while all the other movies were about John breaking at the enemies' game.<br /><br />Another thing is John McClain was always been a slang cop, this movie really downplay that side of his character. I think Bruce Willis do get aged, but it's the script writers fault to play his character more serious than it should.<br /><br />I do still hope there will be Die Hard another day<br /><br />-[...]should.    I do still hope there will be Die Hard another day    -[...]
B0081L37Z0|1.0|What happened to the movies of the 80's?  Cleaner than this.<br /><br />Loved the fact that Johnny Depp had a small part but hated the references to sex and drugs and some of it was plain disgusting.  Kind of like the Jack-Ass movies. There was a really gross part at the end.  A lot of this had me cringing, rather than laughing.<br /><br />If you like that kind of stuff, go for it.  Do not watch with young children (thankfully mine were not there).<br /><br />I do love Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum though but the directing, well, it was lacking and kind of plastered all over.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a great book and it showed the power of friendship and strength. I think u should read this book.

B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My granddaughter introduced me to this app.  I just love it.  We have a lot of fun saying phrases and/or making noises so that Talking Tom Cat repeats them in a strange and funny voice.  Playing with Talking Tom Cat is truly a fun-filled experience.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|I can't stop thinking what would I done if I'm stuck in that situation, I think most people who watch this kind of natural-situation-disaster movie would at least think about it once or twice.<br /><br />#1 When you up that high and you can't climb down because there are no stage. The only viable option is to jump, but jump kills you because the fall.<br /><br />If I was one of them the next question I would ask myself is it possible to jump without getting killed and how.<br /><br />The fall will kill because your body accelerate while falling, if you fall without acceleration, then the fall won't kill you, simple physics - To make a parachute with what you got.<br /><br />They could have taken off some part of their cloth and tie them together, the jumper would probably still get hurt, but even a small jacket when you hold all four ends while jumping, it would reduce the falling speed drastically, specially they're in a windy weather, the wind would carry him in a small amount distance horizontally.<br /><br />It could be done.<br /><br />#2 But it isn't just the fall, the next guy climb his way down, it's the wolves killed him.<br /><br />Wolves are fake, period, I don't buy it. Wolves just don't camp around where a lot of human going up and down on daily base, to protect themselves being hunted. If you 2 minutes after you landed and the whole gang of wolves going at you, it's movie plot, noting more.<br /><br />**Movie's alright, but not the best kind. Try Open Water 2.<br /><br />-[...]
B00BC5I6Q2|2.0|The early episodes of this series are entertaining, but it dissolves into slackness, irrelevance, and a repulsive mixture of sentimentality and sleaze.  And there's something scary about it.  The British House of Cards is the straightforward tale of a paleo-conservative politician who gets fed up with the treachery and hypocrisy of his post-Thatcherite, neo-conservative colleagues and goes on a well-conducted rampage that leaves him as Prime Minister-- the boss. His opponents in the labor party are somewhat peripheral to his story, but they do have a presence, and there is a sense that a democratic government is functioning, however \\"dysfunctionally.\\" The American House of Cards is a twisted tale of a-- what?--a southern Democrat who gets fed up with-- what?-- the treachery and hypocrisy of the Democratic Party and goes on a-- what?-- a series of improbable machinations that continually blow up in his face and that leave him-- where?-- as the vice-president--the flunky.  Meanwhile, the Republican Party is virtually invisible-- there's no sense that even a two-party democracy is functioning.<br />So what does it all mean?  The British series means that paleo-conservatism can become very dangerous as it is repressed and disguised by bland political correctness-- and that is true-- as history has shown.  Francis Urquhart, the paleo-tory, is no fool, and a lot of what he says makes sense.  An American series could have said very much the same thing, because  the same is true of American paleo-conservatism.  But the series' creators apparently are so afraid of American paleo-conservatives that they can't even bring themselves to mention them.  So they give us Francis Underwood, a greedy, mean fool who makes very little sense about anything.<br />A footnote: one of the series' sleazier aspects is the ignorant and distorted way it tries to exploit environmentalism. Just  one minor example: A very smart nuclear power tycoon like the one in the final episode might be a birding hobbyist, but if he was he would know that sun conures don't much resemble the extinct Louisiana parakeet (except that both are medium-sized parrots) and that wood thrushes breed (and therefore sing)  in the woods around Saint Louis, Missouri, not hermit thrushes.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I can't believe how judgmental people are being about this movie! I was absolutely stunned.<br /><br />As far as Jaden's acting, I did not at any point find myself distracted by his acting chops.  I think he believably carried the movie.  Seriously, I did not once take myself out of the movie and think, \\"Wow...this kid has some work to do.\\"<br /><br />As was pointed out in a review, the beginning is a little abrupt.  However, you have enough to get you going and you get flash backs throughout the movie to offer some more explanation.<br /><br />Overall, I think it was a good story line with good acting and good character development.  I plan on buying this movie.
B000QUUD60|5.0|Because I still love Elvis just as much as I did the first time I heard his wonderful voice.  He had the most beautiful face of any man I've ever seen and the most beautiful voice to match.  I miss him stlll and am just happy that he left us so many beautiful memories of him.

B00C7JGDBW|1.0|It's just completely random. Everything all happens at once. No story.  None at all. I can see they were trying to play off the wizard has no powers  but they didn't have to have all 4 good/evil witches fall in love with him. And Vice versa. It was just so predictably unpredictable  I fel asleep twice then turned it off. I could see a good prequel in my head.  But this was just awful.
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|I like it because it has one of the world setup that I like from a comic book, and I haven't seen any movie adapted that yet. The world setup I'm talking about is the world is divided up and down, also applied with higher and lower quality.<br /><br />The visual side is amazing, that's a given, every scene is like one of those futuristic abstract artwork I used to be a fan of from big sites like 2advaced or Chpater3.<br /><br />The romance.. I say they pushed it, I like both Kristen Dunst and Jim Sturgess appearance, I think they have ok chemistry, but just don't expect something like lets say Jack and Rose that kind of tension.<br /><br />Its over all easy come and go movie, they have an interesting idea  but they're limited on what they can do, and they round it up to what is being seen now.<br /><br />Personally I think if this is a musical like Across the Universe would be much better.<br /><br />-[...]

The A lister is going B after few more titles like this one.<br /><br />Even at Lions for Lambs his portrait of probably the youngest governor gets my vote, Knight and Day has nothing, while the new M:I4 gets it he really should thank Brad Bird, he's a million director.

B005LAII3A|2.0|Redo this movie is plain wrong to begin with.    And the change they made was a lousy one, even less entertaining comparing to Arnold.    I'm really being fair to this movie, I tried to like it. And here's what I think.    Pro:  1)the graphic and technology taken in this movie is the only thing that you can say it surpass the first, but what do you expect after 25 years? Computer generated objects are pretty much flawless. And some angles at some scene are breath taken. But it really took down by the other facts.    2) The actors are more handsome, you can arguably say Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale are better at presence than Arnald and Sharon Stone respectively, forgive me but I would say the first one's acting seem more natural to me.    Con:  1) first off, no Mars?? this really pissed me off when I watched it, the Mars Myth was the key plot to the whole story, instead they have the splited colonies when it play absolutely no part in the story, this is a BIG BIG thumb down, way down way way down to bottom of the sewer.    They took it out because Mars colony isn't reality ( that no matter how hard scientist try it won't happen ever). But thats the first mistake they made that they can't distingulish the fake reality and possible future. In science fiction nobody argue what's possible in the future, when it isn't happening yet, just doesn't mean it won't. And that's what we used to like the first movie, introduce what it could be but not it gonna be.    2) no humor, this is another one I found hard to take it down, when I saw the first movie I was both impressed by how the plot was breath taken and how some scene was hilarious - like that when you see Arnald shot his ex wife and say \\"consider that a divorce\\". Instead they have everybody tighten their vein and read something out of the script.. it's uninspiring at the best.    3) no mutants, *sigh, they missed out all the goodies    4) no world change at the end, the ending of original was one of the most reflesh memory experience I had on movies, the world changed about 180 degrees at the last 5 minutes. And the movie lovely throw you a question to its reality just before blackout end credit roll up. This movie practically got nothing..    I used to call the first movie \\"total retard\\" for humor, but this, I don't bother to have another minute engage to it.    -[...]

B004W2V254|4.0|Not a big foreign movie with subtitle guy but this movie is an amazing story of the Germans during the Nazi era attempting to climb the eiger.  It does not appear to be 100% historically accurate but overall, a good movie.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers is the best super hero movie that ever made in the history of Hollywood, it's simply the best because what you're seeing is not one superhero movie, but 4.<br /><br />I've always love the movies that goes trilogy or even Quadrilogy, because it follow up what's been left off, and imprement, it brings you to the new era in the same universe. In reality, 99% of the franchise flops at the end, to name a few, Rocky, Back to the Future in the past, even new series like Twilight, LOTR, in a way, they left you a taste decline on every new one that you see.<br /><br />But not this movie, The Avengers, it work as an pentalogy but you can't call it a Pentalogy because the first 4 weren't prequel but they holds the prequel effect, in reality you can't appreciate this movie unless you've seen the other 4 or at least a couple of them. That's how it work. So this movie actually is built on a new way to produce franchise movies. There were the setups, and there is the feast.<br /><br />I was surprise how they contain each element so good, from beginning to the end, every 5 minutes were break down to be a winner, I can't seem to even find a scene that I would feel sorry for the film makers, the lines are hilourious at times, with good taste. Action scene often bring me surprises, an example would be Thor slam his hammer on Captain America's shield, it was the second after I saw that scene I realized I've always been wondering what would be the result of the impact! And it was really really thrill.<br /><br />-www.mixacase.com
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I actually quite liked this book.  Traditionally I only read Military Sci-Fi, thus this was far out of my genre, yet despite this, I found that Jill Sanders did an amiable job at bringing out an entertaining story in a completely civilian environment.  I was quickly able to build a connection with the various characters and begin trying to piece together what each subtle hint might later reveal itself to have been foreshadowing.  The characters were enjoyable and appropriately flawed, particularly the protagonist, Megan, as she certainly had a troubled past.  There were a notable number of simple typos, though I am more than aware that as an independent author, they are almost unavoidable.  Fortunately, the story was sufficiently engaging that it never really distracted me from the plot itself.  Lastly, by the time I reached the last 20% of the book, I found myself unwilling to break away until I reached the end.  The story had reached a powerful and thrilling climax in a way that I had not expected, though found to be very well done.  Overall, Finding Pride was a well-written experience to serve as my first foray into the genre, and undoubtedly a good read for those already embedded within the Romance field.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Fantastic live cd from the 50th anniversary tour. Couldn't be better! I was on the concert in Oslo and it was great.
0385344228|3.0|I picked up \\"Defending Jacob\\" based on its good reviews. This is a story of a prosecutor, Andy Barber and his family. Andy's son Jacob, a 14 year old teenager, is prosecuted for murder of his school mate. This event changes Andy and his family's life. Now Andy is on the other side of the prosecution tables. Andy believes and supports his son Jacob throughout the case. The book explicates in a grand way the feelings of troubled parents whose son is charged with homicide, and also gives a peek into the mind set of current generation of teenager. Overall the story is good, but I would say it is not very gripping. I read it over a span of 10 days.<br /><br />Overall the book is a good read, and I give it a three star.<br /><br />Happy reading !!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun I have no problems with it its really entertaing I like the themes they come up with it changes the<br />Game is not the boring old game but it changes every month or so like Paris or riodejano
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game. It has  great animation. The speed works out great starts out slow then fast. It gives my granddaughter hours of entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can't stop playing I want all the rewards so I just keep running. I like that each game is always a challenge.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|This CD has a great mix of different music. Of course it is straight from the movie and makes me  think about Edward every time I listen to it. Great music.
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|Most artist talk about making the album they wanted. They lead you to believe that the album was completely their own idea. What fans don't realize is there is a lot of pressure by record execs to steer an album a certain way. Kanye West has the freedom to make whatever album he wants. We figured that out when he did \\"808's & Heartbreak\\". Its kind of ironic that \\"Yeezus\\" released on the same day as  J. Cole's \\"Born Sinner\\". Both albums represent two totally different sides of hip hop spectrum. This album is a slap in the face to rappers who Kanye feels are puppets of the music corporation. While J. Cole talks about making the album he wanted, Kanye has made the album he felt he needed.<br /><br />\\"Yeezus\\" is a dark, bass booming album that will surely catch you off guard. (I advise you not to crank up your speakers when you first listen to this album. You have been warned). A lot of people are criticizing this album because of the lyrics, or lack of lyricism. We seem to forget that Kanye has not rapped since \\"Late Registration\\". Everything since then has been more rants than wordplay. As a Kanye West fan, I have learned to accept his rants and this album is full of them. The bass booming \\"Black Skinhead\\" is a full head on rant with no real direction. \\"I Am a God\\" is a perfect example how Kanye has changed. It is hard to believe that this blasphemous song was made by the same person who made \\"Jesus Walks\\" years ago.  Even without the egotistical rant, this song is one of the albums low points.  The good news is that the album has nowhere to go but up from there. The rants continue on \\"New Slaves\\" as Kanye points a middle finger at the music industry and the way they use black artist. This is the best track on the album. Kanye breaks out the auto-tune for \\"Blood on the Leaves\\", which starts off slow until the beat drops. Very good song until he goes into auto-tune frenzy in the last 90 seconds.  He continues the auto-tune on the solid track \\"Guilt Trip\\". \\"Hold My Liquor\\" was corny to me at first but then it grew on me a little. He ends the album on a high note with \\"Bound 2\\" which is a return to his soulful, \\"College Dropout\\" roots.<br /><br />The way \\"My Beatiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" ended, I didn't want to hear that sound again. Now Kanye West has continued that sound on \\"Yeezus\\". This may just be his worst album to date. (I'm still debating if this is worst than \\"Graduation\\"). This album is short on songs (only 10) and heavy on electronic beats. He has taken this album in a new direction.  I'm not talking about a complete transformation; he has brief periods of the old Kanye which makes me believe that he can turn it on and off when he needs to. Kanye is one of my favorite music artists. Not just rappers. He's a socialite with actual talent.  He has turned into something but we can't figure out what it is. But we accept most of it because he is great at what he does. \\"Yeezus\\" is  Kanye's \\"you can't control me\\" album. He made an album that expands past the boundaries of what people think hip hop should be. Those expecting to hear the \\"Late Registration Ye will be disappointed. Those days are long gone. What we have now is a rage against the system album that is still hip hop but with a very dark edge.  C-or\\" was corny to me at first but then it grew on me a little.

B005EY2XFC|5.0|one of my girl and mines favorite movies ever and now we have it on blu ray!  looks good sounds good!  we have made love many times with this movie playing in the background.  beautiful love story
0062101897|5.0|Harry Potter--Page to Screen. is a Wow!!of a book for the Potter fan who wants the details of film magic.  Loads of background art work as well as photographs to really involve you in the film making process.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This game has changed recently and I no longer enjoy it. The fact that people that pay for credits and power ups get a huge advantage over others is ridiculous. It's a waste of money and I would never pay for a free game and would suggest others don't for Bingo Blitz!!
B008KP6ENE|1.0|Until you master the movements, you are forced to re-start from very beginning each time you fail to complete the first level.  Doing the same movements over and over became quite boring too quickly.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I just received my Neptune today and tried it out in the pool.  For the past several years I've been using an original blue and white Swimp3 so my experience is relative.<br /><br />I was excited about the new connection to iTunes and was eager to try it out.  All of my music was purchased on iTunes so, no luck.  You have to convert every song just like before into MP3.  Only songs that you ripped off of CD's from iTunes are directly compatible.<br /><br />I wanted to be able to take advantage of playlists and figured that the addition of the big MP3 box in the middle with the screen would save me from having to listen to one linear list of songs.  Nope.  No playlists AT ALL.  You can choose to play music by an artist.  Or MANUALLY ONE BY ONE on the TINY PLAYER controls mark a song as a \\"favourite\\".  Wow.  No ALBUM, no GENRE, no file structure.  So basically, no real advantage over the original Swimp3 here unless you want to listen to entire albums.  The extra space is kind of a waste without playlists.<br /><br />The fit was about the same as the original swimp3 and the box that clips onto the back of your goggle band doesn't really make so much of a difference to water resistance.<br /><br />What I do like is being able to see what the battery level is and the less confusing interface.  I bought the Neptune partly because every time I wanted to use my Swimp3 it was discharged even though it was plugged in.  It takes more power to play than a charger provides I suspect and it would often strangely just turn itself on after a few minutes and drain it's own battery when I left the room.  That was pretty frustrating.<br /><br />My big hope - software upgrades.  Hopefully the people in charge of products care about making a good product instead of just selling the first pass to a million mildly disappointed customers.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|My Granddaughter had this in DVD for her son and I thought it was a cute movie. I learned it came in 3- D Blu Ray so I purchased a copy for the Grands and Great Grands when visiting. This just pops with much you miss on DVD. The detail really brings you into the story.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|one of the greatest of all time!  i used to watch this as a kid and laugh my butt off.  almost identical to the first and 100 times better that the new remake.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I do love all the characters so I'm excited there will be a couple more books, could read about them forever!
B00594XOZU|4.0|I gave four stars because I can't seem to find the sign out tab. But other than that it's great
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I  Was Surprised And Disappointed At Day's Ending. She Did Not FinishJusT To Make Money On The Next Book. She Better Be Quick With It.
B009O2XY12|1.0|I wanted Candy Crush, but can't find a way to order it for my Kindle.  This is boring will be removing it...
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|3-D really adds to this and the story is every bit as good as the first. Reviewing 3-D though is my thing and this certainly does not disappoint. They could have done better on reflection and depth of the paint jobs as in the first movie but because of 3- D I don't believe you miss anything.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I like Harry Bosch, though his behavior is<br />sometimes frustrating, even as a fictional<br />character.  I plan to read more Harry.<br /><br />Sam Lusk
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Another great story from Gaiman!  Mesmerizing, scary and sad in the most profound way this beautiful story will take me some time to fully digest.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Good kept me intrigued throughout the entire book but left a lot of unresolved issues. I know another book is coming out but I think somethings could have been resolved within this book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game and it requires some good eyes to find the ever-moving objects in each room. Love it...very addicting!!
B0057F869U|2.0|Viewing options too limited. One of my least favorite rendition of this great classic tale. Wouldn't have minded if I could have rented it, but was it was not an option. Not a happy camper. Well over priced.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|Heart of Obsidian was a really good read it keeps the story going from the others in the series but can also stand alone. I really like this series and can't wait for the next one.
0307716988|5.0|When I ordered this book, I was told it would be delivered between June 21 and July 12.<br />It arrived on the 12th of June: RIGHT ON MY BIRTHDAY! :-)<br />Knowing Michael wrote this book already makes it very special to me and while reading I can 'hear' him say these words; it's his style, his gentle way of talking and I LOVE it!<br />Although I've always been a fan and know a lot about Michael and his family, I was still surprised by certain things he mentioned in this book.<br />I often loan my books to people, but this one will never leave my room! :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome I think everyone should get it once you pick it up you would never want to put it down
B00DGN51O8|1.0|I watched this movie only a couple days ago and can't think of anything stand-out about it. I feel like I deserve a pat on the back for watching the whole thing though!
B006LSZECO|1.0|It may say something about me, rather than the book, but I've tried to finish reading it three times. I read a few pages and give up. The characters hold no interest for me, the story line is not engaging. If I hadn't bought this for my Kindle, I would be asking for my money back.
0374533555|5.0|This is more of a technical rather than pop culture book. However, the main introductory chapters are very readable and then the further chapters in the book are about a deeper look at the key topics. Well organized and thought provoking. dispelled many myths about how we think and make decisions.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|As I was reading this book I remember thinking, WOW, this is realllly slow.  It didn't seem to solve anything, just introduced meaningless story lines, and now I know why - it's not the END.  Nobody cares about Megumi, or the friend on the low carb diet, or the stupid reporter, or Corinne, who shouldn't have even been in this book.  The moments between Gideon and Eva I loved (except when she runs off like a baby and throws herself in the water- so stupid) but the rest of it I'm just not sure of.  What really bothered me: If I remember correctly, in the second book the cop said at the end that nobody cared about Nathan and the fact that he was dead or who killed him and that she was going to drop the case...and that is the TOTAL opposite of this book.  Shame on you Sylvia Day for keeping this going.  If I have to wait another 6 months to read the next book, I won't spend the money.  I liked a lot of the book but I feel duped and  I just hate that Sylvia thought it was ok to poke at my already worn thin pockets.  Not right.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|My brother and I love this series. We watch it many times and can't be bored to watch it. It's very fun.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Been a fan of Kanye since forever. Like many, i dont like his attitude but i do like his music.<br />I like the lyrics but the beat is bad. \\"Blood on the leaves\\" and \\"hold my liquor\\" are the only songs i kinda like.<br />The rest i dont care about. Consider my $11.99 as a baby shower gift kanye. I do like your music, you are a rap genius but i dont quite dig this album.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Takes me back to the days of childhood adventure. Fun for the whole family. Highly recommended flick for kids and adults alike!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book kept my interest from beginning until the end.  His parents were so certain of his innocence, and yet some of the things they remembered about his actions with others as a child should have been a big red flag.  The fact that an innocent man died for what he did and then he kills again was a shocking ending to this book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Couldn't put this one down. Blows so many others out of the water. Right on the money with the way men & women really think. Can't wait to read what you have in store for us next.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Although this game looks fun and interesting, I could not get it to download completely. so if I was you I'd keep looking.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Great app! I love playing with the different effects and doing different things to my pictures. Even my 5 year-old loves it;)
0425263924|5.0|I love the path that Sylvia Day has taken  Gideon & Eva.  Eva' s fight to be independent in her work yet totally Submissive and trusting in  Gideon. Gideons struggle  to allow loved ones in. Their pasts seem to only be the begining of their relationship. It makes me wonder how Eva & Gideon will overcome the past and the secret that they are both keeping in the present. I can't wait for book 4 :-)
B007712XAU|5.0|Seasons 1 & 2 were wonderful. I watched all 6 disk in one sitting. I'm glad I have Season 3 coming...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I like the way he ties all of his characters together.  Sometimes, though, if I didn't get a chance to read for a day or two, if was hard to remember how some of the characters fit into the novel.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed reading every page.  I could not wait for the next chapter.  It was hard to put down.  I have and will recommend this book often.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has faced hardships and knows what love feels like. Basically, anyone with a heart. This is a must-read that changed the way I look at life and how happy I am to have mine. The Stars were certainly aligned in the making of this book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It was a good game with great graphics. I  could not stop paying it, but I had 4 gigs of space left and it slowed my kindle down. It would not even load so I deleted it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I think this show is entertaining and interesting. I really enjoy criminal shows, and I love how the lady makes a life for herself even in the midst of her husband's corruption.
B008RKGF1I|5.0|saw the Broadway & loved it so wanted to see the movie again. The dancing in the movie was a little better, but both were great!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book taught me so much history about World War I and all the atrocities that went on during that war even though there were not yet nuclear bombs.  I love Ken Follett's writing style and how he incorporates all of his research into a novel.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!<br />It is the best game in the whole entire world. Get it and keep it...FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!! Get it.
B007RV5T1U|3.0|Modern dance film. Partly bw, partly color. Choreography was fine as were the performers. But it was episodic with little to connect the dances.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Was not able to locate where the product downloaded or if it did at all. There does not appear to be a way to follow up and I guess since it was free I got what I paid for it .... nothing.
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|Expected a better quality of music from Willie, but he is getting old, so I'd best just stick to his older music so that I can enjoy it more.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Worth the wait! More of the great sexual story... Does not diminish in intensity or story line. If you liked the first books you will like Entwined too!<br />Can't wait for the next adventure!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed this book even more than book one, even though they were equally good.  I learned so much about the rise of Hitler and the oppression of the German people during this time.  Once again, it taught me more than a history book ever did.
B00C2K5C2M|3.0|I really like using Lonely Planet for my travels. I have traveled to more than 30 countries using the Lonely Planet in paper back. I am using Lonely Planet Indonesia as I travel in Indonesia at this time. Just two or three countries of Lonely Planet in paper back can add extra pounds of weight to my suitcase. I just started using my Kindle to carry my Lonely Planet travel books. The Kindle does make it easier to carry more travel books and add very little weight. For this I am grateful. The Lonely Planet Indonesia has been helpful getting me around Indonesia. It helped me to find a hotel when I got to Jakarta and to Jogjakarta. It gave me the Information I needed to see the sights in Jakarta and for a early morning visit to Borobadur.<br /><br /> I am now on the Island of  Gili Trawangan. I have Lonely Planet Indonesia on my Kindle. Again I repeat this makes it light weight and easy to carry. The Lonley Planet Indonesia was helpful getting me around Indonesia from Jakarta to Jogjakarta to Borobadur down to Suribya and on to Bali then to Gili Trawangan and then onto Lombok. I don't book hotels in advance I often found what I needed in my Lonely Planet Indonesia.<br /><br />Some of the down side of the Lonely Planet Indonesia on Kindle is:<br />At times I find the Lonely Planet on the Kindle a bit hard to use; it does not have the ease of flipping from page to page like in the paper back form.<br /><br />The Maps are very nearly Useless. Even when zoomed in they are impossible to read.<br /><br />Information also seem to be abbreviated in some areas that are generally expanded in the paper backs. The list of places to sleep seems to be a short list and sometimes with prices for the more expensive hotels being in greater number. Unlike the more informative paper back.<br /><br /> The picture that lonely planet Indonesia painted of Gili Trawangan is a party party town. I almost avoided this Island because I don't party any more perhaps I came at the right time it is a busy Island but also had an easy enjoyable pace. Gili Trawangan is a place one can come to relax or party. I noticed very little of the party side.<br /><br />I will continue to use Lonely Planet for my travels.  I may be returning to the paper back copies because of ease of use and they give fuller information or perhaps I will adapt and use a little of both the Kindle and the paper back.<br /><br />I am heading for Sri Lanka in 10 days and then into India. I want to get the paper back Lonely Planet and pass on any more E-book copies for this journey.pace. Gili Trawangan is a place one can come to relax or party.

I waited with baited breath & even pre-ordered my 3rd edition before if was finished & published! To say I was 'hanging' out is an understatement.<br />I began reading the Entwined with You and once again got lost in the story, enjoying the momentum knowing it was building up to a crescendo..... Only to all of a sudden turn the page AND..... be confronted with a message from the author informing me that &#34; the story between Gideon & Eva is not yet over&#34; AND that she does not yet know how the story will finish??? REALLY?? Why wasn't I informed that I didn't have to pay for the FULL book yet- as the ending is missing?? Really disappointed and would not on principle purchase any other book written by Sylvia Day ;( no way t win a fan
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is one of the few movies in theater out there that was not designed to be entertaining. No, it was designed to be informative, and I am hecka glad it was made. This movie is important. It may even lead to major changes in the food industry.<br />Look at it this way. It's real simple. Right now, companies hold the most power in America, greater even than the government's in some places. But unlike the government, the company's goal is not to protect the people. No, the goal of the company is one word: profit. And when that ends up doing the opposite of protecting the people, ends up doing widespread and massive harm, the company doesn't care as long as it can get away with it. Because of this, companies need to be watched like a hawk in order to be safe. There are two groups that can watch the companies and keep them in line: the government, and the public. But with all the power that companies hold, they can influence the government to look the other way when it comes to everything that's wrong with the food industry. They can even get the government to help them, by creating subsidies to keep the foods that are the most harmful to us (corn, mostly) cheap, and by defending the unsanitary, harmful, and downright disgusting practices of the food industry in the court and in Congress. So since the government is obviously unhelpful in this matter, the only ones who can help the people are themselves. However, until recent events, the public was completely blind to what was really happening to the food they ate. Even with news reports of massive salmonella and e. coli outbreaks, even with diabetes and obesity on the rise, nobody seemed to bat an eye. But with the rise of books like The Omnivore's Dilemma, and movies such as this, the public is finally starting to realize the truth of the food industry. At last, major revamps are coming the way of the food industry. Just by watching this movie, you are doing your part to help. One thing's for sure: I NEVER want to eat another hamburger.<br /><br />As a side note, the food industry is only one of many. ALL companies are motivated by profit, most, by nothing but it. Just look around your house. 99% of what you see was manufactured by a company. Perhaps it's time that we start to take a better look at what's really happening in America--not just in the food industry.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Too much \\"I love you, can't live without you Angel\\" no guy is that outspoken on his thoughts of love.Same old thing!  No excitement..too much lovey dovey, needs more thrill. I was disappointed totally. Not sure I want to waste my money on next book!
B001NLKT60|5.0|The second of the trilogy that keeps you riveted as it builds on &#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo&#34; and  in the end makes you anxious  to get your copy of book 3 of the Trilogy. The characters become real and personal as you vicariously become immersed in the story.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Following the end of the 3rd season I needed more GoT in my life so I finally decided to delve in to the book series. I'm not disappointed and I doubt others will be either. It's nice to fill in some of the blanks that the series is unable to address. I highly recommend.

B00847KFDS|5.0|What could be better than hearing John Fogerty's unique sound paired with other talented performers? All the cuts on &#34;Wrote a Song for Everyone&#34; took me back to my favourite era, but it was the duet with Bob Seger on &#34;Who'll Stop The Rain?&#34; that grabbed me the most ~ two distinct and instantly recognizable rock n' roll voices together, posing a timeless question.

B0091THRCU|5.0|This case fits my phone like a glove. Very nice leather and well made. This is currently my favorite case!!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This is a really nice smooth running game that is actually fun to play!  The biggest problems are you have to link to social media to complete some of the tasks with no way to opt out or buy your way out of the task. Additionally, you have to purchase some of the main characters in the game. If not for those things the game would be a 5 star. I've simply excepted I will not be able to finish this game.

0756407915|5.0|I read The Name of the Wind and loved kvothe. Picking up the second novel I wasn't let down with its continuation of the story. I think some of the scenes in the Wise Mans Fear were a little hard to believe, however, the story still held its own and I'll definitely continue read the series. I think the worst thing about the series is how long it takes the author to release the sequels, but i'll bide my time patiently.

1416575464|4.0|I found this book to be an interesting approach to decorating.  It did guide me to think a bit differently than just looking for pictures of rooms that I liked.  It also shows photos of the same room decorated differently, which opens up one's thinking.<br /><br />I wish that it had dealt a bit more with styles, rather than just an eclectic method. Some of the photos were of rooms that I did not find attractive at all, just &#34;different&#34;.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this book for people who are wanting to educate themselves about decorating.  It definitely has a place in that collection
B004GHNIRK|5.0|My ever favorite Les Miserables! Victor Hugo's masterpiece. Thanks AMAZON for giving me a free download!!! LOVE IT MUCH! =)
1451662432|5.0|This is an excellent book!! This is more than a big people magazine article.  This is a very well written book.  As you turn each page you are filled with a desire to read more. After reading the book you will feel like you know him. Arnold is a very interesting guy. His story is spell binding. It truly is the American story come to pass.  He had a very definite plan about where he wanted to be. Then he focused all of his activities towards that goal. Through that Everyone can see the benefit of hard work through Arnold's story. You will be inspired about setting a plan for yourself after you read what it did for him.<br /><br />I think it has something for everyone. Naturally the person that loves the Schwarzenegger movie will love the book. You really get to know the man. The average movie fan will love this book. There are scores of stories about how the various movies were made. He also has stories about the inside news of Hollywood makes movies, masses finances, sets casts, decided on scripts and things like that. His stories about running for Governor is also very interesting. I think everyone will learn about why he did what he did. I also think his tactics offer great lessons for all about politics today. The last chapter about his rules of life is very educational.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|i haven't tried it out on the kindle yet but it is usefull. the only thing i don't like is that if you are sighned up for it you can change things and add things and they could be a lie but it is still good
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was a very fun and some what challenging game.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to solve clues and use more than 25 percent of their brain.  Can't wait for more rooms and awhole lot more challenges.

B00A8MGLAI|5.0|The author of the book that this film was based on also wrote the screenplay.  He did an amazing job changing the sequence in which the story is told, making the 6 stories intertwine in a seamless, connective fashion.  Great acting, makeup, effects, story, direction (directors of The Matrix & Run Lola Run collaborated together on this film), cinematography and looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.  A beautiful, ground-breaking film.  I've never seen anything like it.  Very, very highly recommended!!!
B0049J3QAY|5.0|I won't review the movie itself but I will talk about the delivery process from Amazon.  I rented Monstors, Inc. [HD] directly from my Tivo Premiere. The HD video & audio quality was excellent.  It only took a few seconds before the video started downloading. The extra cost for HD was worth the quality.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I loved this book it has help me with so many things it was worth the buy.  I think that every one should read this book.
B00BMCAM6M|2.0|I didn't like this app, at all.  I was looking for something close to a sirius radio, I love cultural music, this just was not what I wanted,.  Its not a bad product, it is just not for me.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I recently started reading the series and I am now into the second series. I heard there was a movie, so I had to get it to watch it. Although as usual there are a few minor differences between the book and the movie, but all in all it is a very good movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who has read the book as otherwise you will get lost quickly.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I had high hopes for this album & pre-ordered shortly after it was announced.  It did not disappoint.  Probably one of BOC's deepest album yet.  You can hear the influences of John Harrison (composed the soundtrack for George Romero's film, &#34;Day of the Dead&#34; ) and other 80s nostalgia.  Gets better with each repeated listen.  Highly recommended!
B006DPXFVM|5.0|There are mant noticable scenes that were deleted from the original. It was a delight to see them make more sense of the story.

B004SH40BQ|4.0|This is a great product. I use it with my &#34;old&#34; Ipod nano (which has no built-in bluetooth) combined with some wireless headphones. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it does tend to drain the Ipod battery quickly (it has no power supply of its own). Also, be sure to follow directions exactly when pairing or it will not work properly.

0385738765|2.0|We're back with Thomas again, and just when the Gladers thought they were safe, it turns out, well, not so much. Now, the surviving Gladers must wend their way through 100 miles of scorching hot desert to a safe haven where they will be given the cure to the disease that almost the entire world has contracted. Their memories still haven't fully returned, but Thomas catches glimpses of his past life. Is WICKED lying to them yet again? Of course, but in what way?<br /><br />I love the concept of this series, if only the execution wasn't so poor! This is the 2nd in \\"The Maze Runner\\" series by Dashner, and just as poorly written as the first. If I weren't so intrigued with the dystopian storyline, and didn't like Minho so much, then I would probably quit. But I'm now on the 3rd book, absolutely determined to finish the series just so I can figure out why the heck everything has happened this way!<br /><br />More reviews found at my blog: [...]

0385737955|2.0|This book is the 1st in \\"The Maze Runner\\" series by James Dashner. I picked it because I'm starving for dystopian teen literature from a boy's perspective. And while the storyline is intriguing, the book itself is so repetitive and poorly constructed as to make for a distracting read. If the concept weren't so intriguing I would have given it up 50 pages in, but by that point I was curious and committed so had to keep reading.<br /><br />Just be forewarned that the writing style will not please most adult readers, like myself. I persevered for the story only. I could care less for most of the characters, the male lead is especially bland, and I would give anything for a constant character representation that went beyond the sadness, happiness, anger that it seems every character feels.<br /><br />So, read it if you're desperate for male dystopian teen lit, but don't expect a masterpiece because you ain't gettin' one.<br /><br />More reviews found at my blog: [...]

1781162646|4.0|Joyland is quick, fast-paced read.  The basic story is about a heartbroken college kid working at a small amusement park over the course of a year.  This particular amusement park just might be haunted by the ghost of a girl who was murdered on one of the rides.  The supernatural aspect and the mystery mostly take a backseat to the meat of the story, the coming-of-age of Devin, the protagonist.  As he tries to heal his broken heart, he meets an interesting cast of characters that work at the park, as well as a terminally ill kid and his mom.  King is mostly known for his horror stories, but he's also very, very skilled at writing about the wonder and heartbreak of youth.  He's clearly an author who very remembers the roller coaster of emotions that come along with adolescence and young adulthood.  If you like his other coming-of-age books like The Low Men in Yellow Coats and The Body, you'll like Joyland.  If you like King, you'll like Joyland.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about the book appears to be a common one.  King seems to be losing his ability to keep politics out of otherwise great stories.  It started to creep in with offhand references to stereotypes of people King disagrees with politically, and has been slowly ramping up.  Under the Dome was a terrific book that was dragged down because King couldn't help but make the antagonist the most two dimensional Dick Cheney caricature he could write.  You'd think a whole novel about how much he hated Cheney would suffice, but here King gets almost to the end of the book before leaping out of the story to tell us all that Cheney should not have gotten a new heart.  It comes out of nowhere and seems very out of place.  I'm complaining, but please also understand that this is one line in the book.  Aside from a few NRA remarks, King minimizes the culture war nonsense otherwise.  I don't quite understand why a guy as sharp as King would think all us dumb proles care what multimillionaires think about Dick Cheney or the NRA, but something about being a skilled entertainer makes people think they should be taken seriously in other areas of life.<br /><br />Aside from that one complaint, the book is fantastic.  Highly recommended.eney or the NRA, but something about being a skilled entertainer makes people think they should be taken seriously in other areas of life.<br /><br />Aside from that one complaint, the book is fantastic.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was a great movie, if you like action. I would watch it again. It was much better than I thought it would be.
0307266303|5.0|This is a compelling book to read and everyone that I've shared it with has enjoyed it. There was lots of new and interesting information for me and it led me to walking barefoot during the warmer 6 months of the year when I can. Even if you have no interest in running or even walking barefoot, I think most people will find the book fascinating.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I like this reader on my Kindle Fire.  App continues to be improved, so I would certainly recommend without reservation.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I thought this was the last installment. Great read but I was disappointed that I have to go ahead and buy another book for the ending and wait another 6-12 months before I can purchase this.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I recently read a review of another Lee Child / Jack Reacher book that was done by a close friend and writer.  His review enticed me and he strongly urged that I begin with the first book of the series.  I was not disappointed in the least.  Child kept both the suspense and character involvement at a high level throughout.  There were a number of times that I thought that I had the plot figured out only to be surprised with a twist of the plot.  Great reading and enjoyment.
B006BQM762|5.0|I saw this in theatres when it first was released, didn't know that I'd end up liking it this much. I like it for what it is, a wonderful sci-fi adventure. Its not real, but it allows for an escape to a different time and place, and isn't that what movies are meant to do? I've seen this many times, and will be buying it on Blu-ray and DVD for the bonus features. I hope they don't make a sequel to this, it would sully what is this great film.
B009KEN87O|5.0|If cought up in a government office for hours this will make it seem you are at the Caribbean watching the waves. This is currently my favorite game. If you like galaga you'll love this one.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Grabbed this app for free and had a ball! The graphics are beautiful and game response is smooth and fluid.  Having never played this type of game before,  detailed instructions would have been very helpful.  Now that I have the hang of the game,  please keep the rooms coming!

B002ZG97EC|5.0|the movie is great and the characters funny as heck(IT's SO FLUFFY).  i love the minions are unique and really make the movie outstanding.  there should be a minion movie.  i bought the combo pack from Amazon with free 2 day shipping,which was awesome.  after i ordered the movie i got an email saying i could watch it right away via Amazon Instant Video, not that is service and a very nice surprise.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this book telling two very different but similar stories of being an orphan and in the foster system.  Two people who should have had nothing to bind them became friends.  Know that orphan trains were a part of our country's history and the author told the story that made me want to read more of her work.

B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Todd M. Thiede has done something I have never seen before.  He has taken a subject, wasting other peoples time, and he made it into a very enjoyable read.  Enjoyable if you like murder that is.  I have read many murder mystery books and this one is very unique.  It is written in the present tense and although that is unusual Thiede pulls it off with ease.  I also like reading the killers thoughts as things unfold.  I felt like I was a fly on the wall of each and every scene as they unfolded.  Great Job and I look forward to the next Max Larkin book
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I thoroughly love the game, but eventually when I try to load up and play it crashes. Then I uninstall and reinstall and am good for a day or two.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Mind challenging. Not overly difficult to complete but it definitely pulls the player into to the puzzle. Some levels are easier than others, but all are entertaining &amp; require thought. I am not easily pleased by most puzzle apps however, I enjoyed playing Can You Escape more than 100 Floors. My kids also enjoy helping me find and use the clues. Fun Game. NEED MORE LEVELS

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this to run while I am at the grocery store keeping track of everything while using my kindle fire as my calculator. Love it!!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I thought this was an excellent movie with great performances, and particularly liked that it was something different. Bradley Cooper earns the praise he received for this role, playing a man with mental health issues returning home after being institutionalized, and trying to win his wife back and start a new life. Jennifer Lawrence is even better as a young widow with stability issues herself, who manipulates him into participating in a dance competition with her.  Every scene between them is spot on in tone, dialogue and depth. The supporting cast is excellent and entertaining as well. It manages to mix poignancy and humor with dark truth, and creates an entertaining and even heartwarming story.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much! I never read this as a child and so I thought that I would see what I missed out on and I am glad I did. Very cute and heart warming story a must read at least once in your life.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it get more technical the further you go, but not to difficult that you will be stuck in a room for hours or have to cheat.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I would rate this with 55 stars if I could.  I love the whole series. I have recommend this to all of my family and friends. It hold your attention through out the whole story.  Can't wait for season 3
B0025KW29U|5.0|joss whedon is such a jerk!! how does he do it? how can he make me sob like a baby with what looks to be so effortless. this is a brilliant little series! i LOVE everyone<br /><br />also the special features has a hilarious take on commentary...musical commentary with such gems as &#34;i'm better than Neil&#34;
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I like where this story is going - so often dystopian trilogies fail to follow through on the promise of the worlds they introduce in the first book. In this case, I feel as if the world the author created has gotten more interesting. I also like the narration alternating between Ky and Cassia. I don't want to give too much away in terms of plot, but in this book they both escape Society and for part of it are searching for each other in the wilds. Once they find each other, they have to make difficult decisions about what to do next. The literature and art themes are continued and magnified in this book, and really trigger some interesting insights about the nature and purpose of language, art, and culture. That aspect of this trilogy is really what lifts it above the fray in my view. I usually don't enjoy the overly dramatic romantic plots, but I don't mind it in the case of this one, because poetry is the primary means through which the romance plays out.<br />My only complaint is that I felt the pacing in this book got a bit slow, so I docked a star for that. Looking forward to the final installment.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I liked it, not as funny as I was expecting. Worth watching at least once. Good bonding film for mom and son.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoy the series inasmuch as it is the same story line as a lot of other books out there. Same idea as Fifty Shades but MUCH BETTER written. I will give her that. The relationship is grossly unhealthy, but equally romantic and all of this just intensifies in the third installment. Overall, it's shallow but entertaining.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|When I like a movie I always like owning the whole collection so that I can watch them all start to finish.  This product allows me to do just that!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I hope they come out with another book I want more of cross I hope it comes out this year don't want to wait long
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|My family and I enjoyed this more than I thought we would. I had heard it was a bit dark, and so was concerned my 8 and 6 year olds would find it too scary, but it was fine for them. It is basically a `prequel' to the Wizard of Oz, although you (or your kids) don't need to have seen that to follow this.  James Franco plays a traveling magician who is swept up into a tornado (or dream, depending on your interpretation) and lands in Oz, where through a circuitous series of events, he ends up as the Wizard. Dorothy and gang don't figure in this story, though both the wicked witch (Mila Kunis) and the good witch (Michelle Wiliams) do. The special effects are great, and the story, although not terribly inventive, carries along well enough. Overall, it's a good family film - perhaps a bit too dark for the preschool set, but elementary age and up should enjoy it. Let go of your attachments to the original Wizard of Oz, and just enjoy this for the performances and special effects, as an entertaining family film.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a woman trying to climb the corporate &#34;jungle gym,&#34; this book is great.  I learned a lot and how to change on how I can do my future interactions in the business world.  I am currenlty looking for a new job and it's really helped in my search of potentially jumping careers.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is addictive and fun to play. It's frustrating because it takes a very, very long time to get the different shards  needed to activate the elements of kindness.  If you want a game that moves along quickly, this is not the game for you.

B000YJ54DU|2.0|I've read all 12 books in the Reacher series and I read a lot of the reviews of Nothing to Lose (Book #12) before downloading.  I'll admit, based on the significantly lower average reviews for this particular Reacher story, particularly the prevalence of 1-star reviews that consistently hammered this installment, I considered skipping this book altogether.  After all, my experience so far suggests each novel is largely independent of the other and doesn't necessarily require the reader to follow the series in order or, for that matter, read all the books.  That said, I also read enough 5-star reviews contradicting the negative reviews that I decided to take my chances and form my own opinion.  In fact, given the central issues of &#34;religion&#34; and &#34;anti-war politics&#34; cited by most bad reviews, I was motivated to prove to myself and others that they were simply injecting their own religious and/or political ardor into the mix, and ultimately this story would deliver on the &#34;Reacher formula&#34; of success.<br /><br />I believe Lee Child's success with this series is primarily based on each of our deep seated desire for justice in a world where so often we feel powerless or frustrated by the lack there of.  In Reacher, Child has created a character that has the intelligence, experience and physical ability to serve as judge, jury and executioner in a relatively believable way and Child places him into circumstances where this unique combination of assets can be utilized to their fullest.  At it's most basic level, Reacher is able to do things we all wish we could do, but can't...so Reacher does it for us.<br /><br />Secondarily, it doesn't hurt that Reacher somehow ends up always being associated with a good looking &#34;love interest&#34; (or is that &#34;one-night-stand interest&#34;) that adds a little intrigue and romance to each story.  This, despite the fact Reacher's personal hygiene and sociability seem to deteriorate with each passing novel, nearing the point of degenerate sociopath.  For example, just prior to his first carnal experience with this entry's fair maiden, Reacher realizes while dressing himself post-shower in his motel room en route to &#34;date night&#34; that his single pair of days (or weeks?) old, unwashed underwear is ripe beyond usefulness.  So he throws them away and presumably goes commando for the remainder of the story.  In this regard, Reacher, it's time to get a life.<br /><br />Thus, the Reacher formula simplified is JUSTICE + LOVE = ENTERTAINMENT<br /><br />So how does this book do?<br /><br />Let me start by saying the themes of &#34;religion&#34; and &#34;anti-war politics&#34; that were negatively highlighted by many reviewers do exist.  But you'll get most of the way through the book before these topics become important to the storyline and, up to that point, this book stayed mostly true to the Reacher formula.  In other words, I didn't agree with many negative reviewers that this installment in the Reacher series reflected a &#34;selling out&#34; or &#34;taking a pass&#34; by Lee Child.  I think most of this story was true to the Reacher brand.<br /><br />However, the last quarter or so of the story did begin to break-down for me for two reasons.<br /><br />First, I don't agree with many reviewers that, treated individually, the themes of either &#34;religion&#34; or &#34;anti-war politics&#34; were overdone in and of themselves.  I think the problem stems from the fact that both themes were so closely merged together over a relatively small section of the story that it simply becomes overwhelming and comes off as an angry rant by Reacher, presumably on behalf of the author.  So, while I didn't find either treatment offensive (people are entitled to their opinion and the story reflects a reality that exists), it does get annoying.<br /><br />Second (and for me the bigger issue), the JUSTICE element of the Reacher formula in this story ends up blending with the LOVE element in a way that left me disappointed and angry with Reacher's character, and ultimately a little queezy.  Normally, the JUSTICE element of the formula is focused on and limited to those &#34;bad guys&#34; that deserve it.  But in this story it creepily extends to Reacher's love interest, as he's cast alongside a female protagonist who, because of a tragedy that is disclosed later in the story, is struggling to move on from her past and form new &#34;male relationships&#34;...that is until Reacher comes along, sees an opportunity to &#34;fix&#34; this situation by taking her to bed and then forcing himself on her as a way to help her through her new found guilt that stems from their first encouter.  It's about as close as I ever want to get to psychological date rape, and it really bothered me.<br /><br />Reacher needs to limit his overdeveloped sense of judgement and justice to those who deserve it, and keep it out of the bedroom.<br /><br />Bottom line:  most of this book delivers on the Reacher formula.  But by the end things broke down to a degree that left me disappointed.  In hindsight, I would have skipped this book but for different reasons than most of the negative reviews I have read.nt in a way that left me disappointed and angry with Reacher's character, and ultimately a little queezy.

B00CA4S27W|4.0|I have been listening to this disk for a couple of weeks now and although for me it strays off the path just a bit, I am starting to like it more and more.  Even though there is nothing incredible on this record, and its certainly not their best work to date, it still carries a lot of what BN is now well known.<br />Believe it, these songs will grow on you.  Particularly interesting to me is \\"Carry on..Jon,\\" which apparently is the first song that I have heard of dedicated to his friend Jon Lord who died last year from cancer. Lord was a musical pioneer and virtuoso who, with Ritchie Blackmore, solidified Deep Purple's place in the history of rock. The song is also a great tribute to Lord. If you are a BN fan as I am, you wont go wrong. If you still are not convinced, it's time to wake up, listen to and enjoy their music.

0786886811|5.0|I really love this book, and there is no way that this review can extol all of its virtues! The best thing is how accessible Nigella has made all of these procedures. If I am honest; baking always seemed kind of terrifying to me and seemed like it was the territory of the expert. What this book does is demystify all of that and teaches you, in a very calm and freindly way, how to do it. Before I knew it I was baking home made bread and rolling pastry for pies and tarts. As she says; cakes, cookies, and other desserts are a snap and if you follow these methods, you will never see the need for a boxed mix again!<br />The writing, as ever, is wonderful. The text is warm, freindly, and inviting, and reading the book leaves you completely charmed. Again, her way of cutting through porcess leaves you feeling enthused and confident that you can do it. I have many other baking books (Richard Sax, Dorie Greenspan, Sarah Raven, Delia Smith) and all of them are good, but none come close to this. Those other books usually leave me feeling tense, which of course finds a way to sabatoge your cooking. Nigella leaves you feeling calm and confident, allowing you to have repeated success!<br />The recipes themselves are divine! Nigella has always had a knack with sweets, and this is a showcase for that. However, this book contains many recipes for savory tarts, pies, biscuits, and breads as well.Her flavor and texture profiles are always spot on: The Londin Cheese Cake has a light texture and a not too sweet tang. The Snickerdoodles have the feel of a doughnut, with a warm and spiced flavor. The Essential White Loaf features a chewy crust with a soft, fluffy interior. The Dense Chocolate Loaf Cake reads plain on the page, but is heady with flavor and unbelievably moist! Some other favorites include: Easy Almond Cake, Autumnul Birthday Cake, Banana Bread, Coconut Macaroons,Supper Onion Pie, Blackberry Galette, Chestnut Ice Cream Meringue Cake, Torta alla Gianduia, Brownies, ChocolateCherry Cupcakes, Snow Topped Spice Cake, Christmas Cupcakes, Cranberry Upside-Down Cake, Creme Brulee, Brown Bread, Finnish Rye Bread, Bagels, Flatbreads, Passionfruit Curd, Blackberry Jam, and Chinese Plum Sauce. I know this is a long list; but the book really does help you make a habit out of home baking, and you will find that there are countless reasons in which a home-made something needs to be produced.<br />My one suggestion would be to avoid the American print of this book. Unfortunately, the American publisher did a poor job in translating the recipes into imperial measurements. Go to Amazon UK, order the original UK print, and buy a food scale to help you with the metric measurements. This will actually help you as the metric system is MUCH MORE reliable when baking!<br />In my opinion, this is the best baking book avialable, and I reccomend it highly!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Just like the other 2 books in the series, this book is just &#34;okay.&#34; The story line is somewhat interesting in this book, with a few exciting interjections. The thing that bothered me the most about this book was the writing style. Terrible. Just terrible. The author often repeats the same words and phrases, which can get really annoying after the first 10 pages. And seriously, who calls their spouse my &#34;Mr.&#34; and &#34;Mrs.&#34; all the time? Ridiculous. These books are so popular because they paint a fascinating picture of a sex life that a woman can only dream of, not to mention the handsome rich man and everything that comes with him. For anyone who truly enjoys reading, appreciates the art of writing, and has at least half a brain and some decent education, they will probably scoff at this waste of paper.
0920668372|4.0|I loved this story so I bought 2 of them as present to my son and my daughter who are married with children.<br />The book was in great shape except the printing is not good as I expected.  However I recommend this<br />book and the service of shipping it was excellent

B00AYR2FOI|5.0|[[ASIN:B00A, YR2FOI Memphis]]<br /><br /> I love, love, love this cd. I love Boz Scaggs, always have.  I  have never followed his career, feverisly, but I have always lived his style. I missed him, very much for a long time and I was in another store and there he was.....I knew this cd had to go home with me.<br /><br />Memphis, is wonderful. The style and grace that he adds to these songs, is just so wonderful.<br /><br />The song \\"Sunny Gone\\" is wrenching, but so lovely and beautiful. It's my favourite. Beautiful melody, I just put the car cd player  on REPEAT and listen to \\"Sunny Gone\\" over and over....I cried the first time I heard it. I was not expecting to do so, but I had just lost my beloved Jack Russell Terrier and it made me think of him.<br /><br />To me, this cd is so worth the money and so very much worth the time and patience to listen to. It is not all upbeat and jazzy, like the old stuff. This cd has a quiet grace and a lovely manner. I think that the long absence of Boz Scaggs, was in some ways worth the wait.<br /><br />So glad, that he is recoding again...
B001AX9DT0|5.0|As with all of Ray LaMontagne's albums, this one is excellent. I can't get enough of this artist and can see myself listening to this album all summer..

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I liked this final conclusion (finally) to The Wheel of Time series.  Yes,  I have read all of them and am just glad to have all the characters complete their tasks or die trying.
0393338827|5.0|The book tells a compelling story, in simple words and with a passion.  It is a page turner, yet deals with serious (and sad and disgusting) matters.  Very enjoyable, and even somewhat educational.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|the game is incredibly hard challenging and has an deep and intresting story go buy it if in doubt. who puts a word limit on a review?
0061124958|5.0|This is my all-time favorite children's book! I could not wait to receive it. I started reading it to my girls the minute the UPS driver dropped it at the doorstep!
B0053FANT0|2.0|My husband watched the first in this serious - purchased both of the together - and after seeing the first one he said he had no desire to see the second one, so we returned this item.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some what of a challenge but easy enough to be entertaining. The puzzles start off straightforward,then you have to work for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is extremely addictive but it is also excellent for hand and eye coordination whether you're a 4 year old like my granddaughter or a senior citizen. It's very challenging, full of color and has surprises all the time. Looking forward to playing it.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This shows has  it all. A fasinating storyline, great performers, musical acts.  Debra Messing, Angelica Huston, Megan Hilty(?) great acting.  I truly hope it keeps running.  The guest stars are wonderful.  This show should win emmys galore.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|What a great movie.  Blu-ray really makes it pop.  Disk is working fine thus far and the price was reasonable.  What not to like?
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I do grocery shopping for both myself and my sister.  This gives me a simple way to keep track of both our needs. Is easy to use.. easy to read, and am sure it will come in handy as I find more occasions to use it!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I never watched this series and when it went on sale I thought I'd give it a shot.  The packaging is excellent and easy to organize, the picture is beautiful, and the series is funny and fun, plus I love to watch Rob Lowe working, he really is a great actor.
0618918248|1.0|Watch Kent Hovind's seminars on YouTube. Enough said.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Sooooo bummed when we realized we could not watch Season 3 yet.  We got hooked and found ourselves watching every night.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Story line picked up about where it was left off from previous book. New twists were added, but left incomplete....another book?
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I loved Hosseine's other books, but I found this one to be confusing. It was all over the place. Not as well written as his other 2 books. I couldn't wait to read it...very disappointing!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I play this on my Kindle Fire, and love it. But ever since the newest update (where you can release the animals) every time I log in, it downloads the update and I have to wait 2 minutes for it to load. This is the only problem, other wise I'd give 5 stars.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|What little girl wouldn't want to be her? Great story with a bit of a stretch on the mother bear.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|\\"I would see ideas in dreams...\\" This is a documentary about obsession, compulsion and a samurai-like focus towards perfection in one's craft- all elegantly wrapped in layers of humility. This is a portrait of eighty-five year old sushi master Jiro Ono. It offers insight into his life and the inner workings of his prestigious humble little 10-seat sushi bar Sukiyabashi Jiro. His story is beautifully told and artfully filmed. Highly recommended- especially if you have any interest in the culinary world.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|Classics all, classics both. Art and Neil gently nurtured a generation of Free Love freaks into socially aware yet tongue-in-cheek grown ups. Music for their times, music for our times, music for all time.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Make the poisons free but any way I like this app because Ben reminds me of myself because I burp and don't say excuse me lol that's it just make the poisons free
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Have been reading Jeffrey Archer for many years.  Stumbled upon this trilogy and read the first 2, and found I had to immediately download the third to my reader.  Couldn't put it down.  A well written book that keeps you reading.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This is a fantastic story of Noonien Soong's attempt to save his sons.  Mack is an excellent author weaving character development and drama into a completely original tale.
B003N0XDT4|1.0|Got it in the mail, overnighted it. Tried to charge for about 6 hours, unplugged it from the usb to PC charge and nothing. Turns out this is a common problem on various forums. Sending it back to try the more recent  FiiO E07K Andes Portable USB DAC Headphone Amplifier. We'll see what happens.
B00932A4XE|4.0|It was an easy watch, cute, funny, nothing special but worth the time I took to watch it.  Would recommend it.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|This movie was very disappointing. I was hoping for something a little like the wizard of oz only with better visual and sounds effects..you know.. up to date special effects. This movie was about three woman wanting to sleep with the same idiot, and all this idiot want's is to govern the people and have all their treasures for him self. What a stupid movie. It's like a love triangle..what type of audience was this retarded movie made for any way?
B00AQMSJI2|1.0|I don't like these pay as you go games.  The value is not there.  The land gets more expensive as you play but the money does not.  It would be better to play something else and invest your money in something real.
0060899220|5.0|This book is amazing and a must read! it was in fantastic quality affordable and shipped with great speed i would def consider another purchase!
B00005JLIU|5.0|I love this film.  I've watched it over the years so many times I think I have it memorized.  The production numbers are wonderful.  Julie Andrews is wonderful.  You can't go wrong with this film if you want pure fun.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have thought this entire series has been good and leaving you wanting more!  You won't be able to put the books down.  A must read!!
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Like probably quite a few people lately after seeing the film I went back to the source and started with the first book to see what this hype was all about.  Given that the book is always better than the film I was frankly a little disappointed.  The story line is good and the characters come across as at least real but I was expecting maybe a little bit more ( violence, mystery, twists? - not sure) but while I enjoyed the read and will probably invest in the next book when I run out of other authors, I am not in a great hurry.  Good stable but somewhat too laid back maybe?  Hopefully the next the series will be better.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Its all there in my opinion just what it is meant to be good guys and bad guys duke it out.. Arnold is getting a little older but still dishes it out .. If you like Arnold movies watch it to be entertained not intellectually stimulated... It also has pretty girls and a little humor can you ask for more just grab some popcorn enjoy..
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Nice graphics good storyline game hesitates a bit but not bother sons.  Playing on  kindle fire..  did get hung up when we n I had to play the piano in last chapter.  I couldn't play the piano quick enough, the kindle didn't react fast enough so I had to skip that game.  I can play the piano in real life so it shouldn't have been a problem.  I did the game a bit short for the price.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Why didn't this book grab me? Was I waiting for action other than the cerebral kind? I read it in a few hours..the prose polished and effective.  But am left unsatisfied.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best game because it is finally catching up to the pc version and has armor,buckets,cakes,eggs,and larger world spawn radius. In creative they added spawn eggs so it is now easier to make animal farms without any other apps!<br />And that is all I have to say . Sweat
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Call them the new Paramore, but I love them all the same. This was an awesome album. It has some of my favorite Paramore songs. Definitely worth the money! :)
B003B02OOG|5.0|Very suspenseful and fascinating.  Have read it for the second time, would recommend it to anyone who likes good books.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|like the hero.  Jack Reacher is an exciting character.  Bring on more of him and his exploits.  Couldn't put the book down
0143039482|3.0|I suppose the book has 'grist' for book club discussions about character.  However, the main character is so-o-o reflective it can drive you nuts.  There is not alot of action in the story, a lot of mulling instead.  If you're interested in what life was like in a zenophobic small town, East Coast USA 1960, you'll get a snapshot of a 'dark Andy Griffith' life:  town drunk, town 'tart', thin cop, fat cop, foreign guy.  I thought the first half of the book was more clearly written.
1440503257|5.0|I got this for my soon to be daughter in law and she loved all of the great recipes. Good purchase for any Harry fan!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I downloaded this game not really thinking it was gonna be worth my buck. I was so wrong! I love this game and have told friends about it who are having a blast with it! We try to challenge our self to see who can destroy the world faster lol. I love this game!
B001MBK3T4|5.0|I first listened to this  in my late teens(late 80s) and was knocked OUT by it . I listened to a lot of Black Sabbath with Ozzy but this was my first experience with Dio. I only knew him from Last In Line and Holy Diver. Excellent guitar riffs  and pounding sounds but its Dios voice that gave a real strength to this album.Haunting lyrics, &#34;eight miles high about to fall and no one there to catch you&#34; &#60;--- twentysix years later and I still get an odd uneasiness when I hear that .<br /><br />  A Very effective listening experience. Worth the price times 2 !
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is pretty good, but.... There are some issues when it comes to performing some operations. Sharing of posts is one of them. I have my regular fb page and one that I am administrator of. Sometimes I can not share content while using this app. Minor issue but I would like to see a fix for it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I used to have horses but due to travel and finances I cannot own them currently. this game is a fun little thing for those of us who can never get horses out of our systems
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is an eye opening book if you aren't familiar with the historical science of power. My Husband was an electrical engineer and so there has been plenty of debate in our house. This book is a fairly good read for anyone interested.
B00124FQCK|4.0|Ian Gillan im most familiar with from Deep Purple. I like his music but im just not big on his voice , he doesnt seem to have a lot of power in it. Listen to his screams , they actually remind me of Wendy O'Williams , not much power . Meh, what do I know. I DO know that the songs themselves are all pretty strong,good guitar and drums.Disturbing the Priest is perhaps the most epic song in the Black Sabbath library, ESPECIALLY with the wonderfully delicate Instrumental lead-in &#34;Stonehenge&#34;. Gillan may not have a great metal scream but he sure has THE metal laugh. His work with Deep Purple is also very good with quite a few stand out songs
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|took a long time to download this very cool game lots of fun glad i got it and it works great
1781162646|5.0|I'm still peeling from the sunburn I got while reading this on the beach (I was in Myrtle Beach, SC, just down the coast of his fictitious town in the story) .  I could not put the book down.  I've always been a fan of Stephen King, but with five kids, I don't have time to read a lot of his \\"typical\\" huge novels.  This book is all you could ask for in a \\"fun\\" read.  It's not too \\"heavy\\" or \\"deep\\" but it does have a good plot, interesting characters, and a good mystery, with a twist in the end.  All in all, this has become one of my favorite reads of late, and I tell everyone I meet about it.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I love this game bubble witch saga is one of my favorites that i play on FB. Now that  it's available on Kindle Fire HD I can enjoy it on the go. However the only reason I won't give it five stars. Is because on FB. The laser pointer is more manageable.  This version offers a update for Kindle Fire that conflicts and won't update on the Kindle. So if you don't mind the bulky laser pointer. You'll love this mind teasing bubble game.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|I like those type of movies anyway but putting Arnie in it was a good fit . He must have been practiceing his acting skills while Govenor of California
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|Good, solid listen. What IS there is very good. But, one has to wonder if this new formation of a band really had it all together, why wouldn't they put out a full CD? It's only 35 minutes long. Did they run out of ideas? Run out of good riffs? Also, the singer (whatever his name is) is basically just aping Tate. There is nothing talented about that. It's a singer mimicing someone else, that's all.
B0067R0APK|2.0|Too slow to load. Graphics not as good as old one. How can I get the old version back? Can't believed version is less than free one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun if u love horses u will love this game it has so much stuff to unlock and do.
006114665X|4.0|I'm into history and when I heard of this book I thought I'd give it a go. I'm more familiar with WWII than WWI so it sounded like a comprehensive tome. It's a big book, over 600 pages and I knew I had to buy it since there was no possible way I could finish it within a libraries check out time frame.  It's is a complicated event in world history with many actors, countries and political factions. I'm sticking with it but it is slow going. Some parts I have to reread more than once to comprehend what the author is trying to convey. Some of the language is &#34;British&#34; as well as the spelling/grammar that you have to slug through. Overall if you are a history buff and want to know more about WWI this is your go to Book.
B000001FT2|4.0|Grace Jones epitomizes 80's music, but with the soul of a poet.  The music isn't complicated, being mostly electronic, but danceable.  her lyrics are vague, but interesting and odd, while oddly connectable
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I love puzzle games. This one to me was really unique an very interactive. However I felt as if the puzzles were to easy and not very hard to figure out.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I'm excited to have QR back and sounding great. It is very telling after this release who was coming up with the silly text based song titles if you not Wot I mean.<br /><br />For someone like me having a good release by Alice in Chains and Queensryche playing as I go about my day is perfect!<br /><br />I agree about the mastering though. I'm no audio expert but from what I understand the mastering is what makes some of the songs the same volume throughout. I think that detracts from the obvious quality of the musicianship and vocals.
1400032717|5.0|I stumbled upon this and loved it.  Can't comment on how well it captures the asperger's syndrome in the main character, but I loved his narration and the end tugged hear on my heartstrings
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Tough record to make for AIC as they don't have the 'first record post- Layne' safety net any longer but, as it happens, it's actually a step forward from the excellent 'Black Gives Way To Blue', if a little less uplifting in tone. What we are reminded of constantly though is just how big a part Jerry Cantrell was of that early AIC sound. Layne  was fabulous and unique but Jerry was and is every bit as important. Singles ' Hollow' and 'Stone' are monsters whereas stealthier tracks like 'Choke' and 'Scalpel' only add to the record's slow-burn appeal. A must have for any fan of heavier music.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is another great book by Sylvia Day. I'm still in love with the characters and still interested in learning more about their history and what in their past makes them so connected in the story. I'm looking forward to the next book.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Kik is a good app. It is easy to use. There is really nothing bad about it but one thing and that is just how sometimes it takes a long time to send. But I like how it tells you when the person read it and when they are  typing. Because then you know if they are ignoring you or just haven't read it yet. So I do recommend this app!! :)
B009RH9FR6|2.0|I don't know what you mean by rotating, the only way it will rotate is if I rotate it.Look at the picture of the case,I would have to take the Kindle out of the designed holder to make it look like the picture which defeats the purpose of the case.<br />There were hardly any directions or suggested idea&#34;s on how to use this accessory.<br />The case itself is of &#34;good&#34; quality and should last. It could use more areas to store things and someplace to put some type of ID so it could be returned if lost<br />  I just had a thought,I'm going to the Kindle store and look for Marware and maybe I can find some ideas!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is different from anything on network television.  The saga of the family upstairs and their servants downstairs is well-told and well-acted, to keep viewers engaged and entertained in every episode, always wanting to know what will happen next.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Hearing this album was like seeing a dog again you thought was lost forever.....each song made me more angry at Geoff Tate......thank you Queensryche for coming home!!!!11
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The story is good, relevant, and used to be probably more truth than fiction. Good film for the classroom or counseling.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Just started watching the show and love it so far. Would recommend watching it. We are trying to catch up starting from season one this summer.
B000U6BT40|5.0|seems plausible for a sci fi show. the effects are great and the characters likable. too bad it only went for 5 seasons
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading the first two Hunger Games I was excited to read this one.  While Mockingjay was exciting to read, I felt it was a bit darker than the others.  I felt okay with the ending, but I wasn't super thrilled about it.  It was still worth reading though.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this app!! This is the perfect app for long trips because of the options you can use fir the persons hair!!! &lt;3 it!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|awesome game,  but one flaw it would be a whole lot better if you could lite tnt in creative mode.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I heard this monie was good but it is one of the best and destined to be a classic. Rooney mara was fantastic and craig was good too but the story line was my kind of script.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I found this to be a quick summer read and enjoyed this book as much as the first in the series.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I enjoyed his first two books tremendously and this certainly, in my mind, did not live up to my expectations.  The other two I could not put down but this story seemed shallow compared to his other books.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Just like the other two this one was a joy to read. Not as explicit as the others but kept the imagination going. Can't wait f or next book
B0092S4WLY|4.0|great game and I highly reccomend it for those who like puzzles- also if you like mysteries and like to solve them then this is the game for you!
0439023521|4.0|good book to read for school.it makes you think about the future.it makes you think about your children and grandchildren's future also. canat wait for book #2
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting!!!I cant stop playing and I almost unlocked everything in a short period of time! I would definitely recommend this game to people who like car games.
143353083X|3.0|The writing in this book is just way too small. I ended up ordering a full size version which is perfact me. It's a great study bible, but I can't see the words to good.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I really had a great time playing this. Scribblenauts is addicting, and I played it for hours and hours.<br />The only con is that there are only five worlds. Even after buying the world expansion, still only five.
6305882592|5.0|This is known as a cult movie.....  I was hooked the first time I saw it !!!  I have seen it a hundred times, and still enjoy it !!!<br />This is one where, even if you know what's coming, it is still amusing.  Two, actually three great performances, since his<br />mother is one of the main characters...  She is awesome !!!!!  If you like Cat Stevens, you gotta see this movie !!!<br />Got this because it was time to get the DVD.....  not the VCR tape,,,,,  LOL
9889979942|3.0|The book is too hard to hold comfortably because it is so thick. Because of its odd, small square size, it does not fit on my bookshelves.  The photos are great but there are so many it gets boring.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I feel like I got half a book.  The other two books were twice as big as this one.  Why?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great addition to the series. Already too impatient for the next one to come out! Can't wait to see where the story goes
B000V86OKG|5.0|I recommend Dexter to everybody.  It is one of the best series ever and the second time I'm viewing it.  So much I missed the first time and worth watching again!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Hard to miss with Homme, but this is particularly amazing. Given the the amount of time between records I was a bit concerned, but listen after listen there's even more to discover with Queens.
0385344228|5.0|I don't think I have ever read a book as strong as Defending Jacob.  The love of parents of their child is an unspeakable and unbreakable bond but to see it portrayed by Mr. Landay is a fete in itself.  Expertly written with very strong emotions from all of the characters in the book is sure to stay with you long after you have read the book.  I finished reading Defending Jacob two days ago and I keep thinking about it!<br /><br />What do you do when you are faced with a problem with your child or is there a problem at all?  These are only questions that a parent can answer but can they see only what they want to see?  Or do they think the worst?  Powerful writing by Mr. Landay to portray a family in turmoil.<br /><br />If there is a book that needs to be read, it is Defending Jacob.  Put it on top of your reading list and hang on for a superb novel!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved playing the other elevator game and loved playing this one too. Challenging, yet not frustrating. Looking forward to more rooms.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put the book down for a second.. Sylvia Day is my new favorite Author. She kept me on my toes waiting for this book to come out and she surely didn't disappoint.<br /><br />I can't wait for more!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this book, can't wait for book 4 once I started reading could not put it down till I was finished with it
159562015X|5.0|This book was highly recommended by a family member.  I have a non-profit and we are going to use it for a board retreat.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book raped me in the heart. It was so meaningful in many ways. So many lessons can learned and practiced from reading this book. Pretty much it teaches you how to live a good life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is the best solitaire app out there. the best features and the most fun. I love the help button.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|So many hours spent playing this game on each of my phones and tablets.  Probably the best game out there to convince someone to buy a tablet of their own ;)<br /><br />Looking forward to PvZ 2!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|As always, James Altucher's writing is both insightful and entertaining. I want everyone in my life to stop what they're doing and read this book...now.
8866135909|1.0|cannot return for an exchange - I wanted the larger one . Can nly get a refund then purchase again...Not a good policy .
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|I love that some of the songs have a Billy Joel (esq) sound. The entire album is infectious and continually puts a smile on my face =)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Let me start by saying that I read the first two books and have been waiting for the third to come out. For that reason, I hadn't read any reviews prior to reading this book and honestly I was already dreading an ending to Eva and Gideon. I am actually very excited that the series didn't end with this book! I also don't mind if Ms. Day stretches it out to the rumored five books.  I LOVE this couple and their complicated love story!! Like many, I started reading this genre with 50 Shades and loved that series. I let some of the reviews of the Crossfire series put me off to reading this series immediately but I have found the two series to be different and for me the Crossfire series is the better books.<br /><br />More specifically, this book filled us in on some further background on Gideon, Eva, and Cary.  It was full of the steamy action we are all used to with Gideon and Eva.  The couple has grown even stronger in their love for one another and a the while continuing to encounter obstacles. I am still undecided on my feelings for Cary. I want to love him but he has some major issues. Ms. Day developed the story wonderfully at a great pace.<br /><br />I can NOT wait to read the next one!! While I tend to agree that $10 a book is a lot for a five book series, I know that I won't hesitate on buying the next book!
0694003611|5.0|EXCELLENT condition, no problems, recommend this book to anyone looking for a great bedtime story to read their little one!
B004GXZ69W|4.0|At first I ordered the VM4RW because I wanted a wireless mouse, but as I feared it proved to be too large for my small hand. This mouse fits my hand perfectly (I measure 6.5&#34; from the tip of my middle finger to the crease in my wrist) and the wire has not gotten in the way (The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to it being wired. If it was wireless it'd definitely get 5 stars!). It's very easy to set up and use and I don't have to consciously try to hold onto it. One thing that did take some getting used to is where the thumb wrests is where the lights are to show what speed you have it set on and since the lights don't go off (like they did on the wireless) it feels warm and almost a little damp there all the time. Maybe a plus will be that my hand will be warm during the winter! This mouse has definitely helped the tendonitis in my wrist so if you're looking for some similar relief I recommend you give this mouse a try.
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|An unforgettable story! Betty's memory, explanation and description of heaven is breathtaking--so vivid you can see it and understand why she wanted to stay.  It helped me with a grieving heart.  I pray to the Warring Angels in times of need.  Inspirational.  Amazing.  Puts a mind and a heart at peace...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a really fun and great game for all horse lovers. Great graphics its the best horse game on the market. Must buy.
B008HK3S9K|5.0|It is just perfect for me I just wanted something small not bulky and something that would protect the kindle while in my purse
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Great read, very original story line. I only gave it four stars for the unnecessary use of obscenities. Looking forward to the next book!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I just could not put it down. Can't wait for the next great book by Sylvia Day. Another page turner I hope.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|The only bad parts for children is the giants eating people. I watch it two times, so it can't be that bad.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|It keeps asking me to buy more stuff....  It didn't seem that I could play any game without making more purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome I play it 24/7/52/12 and I cant wait to get back on it and play again
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|to start off, this is the first gaming specific mouse that I've used and I picked it based on its price and reviews, you can rarely go wrong when the ratio of positive to negative reviews is a 100 to 1. I looked over dozens of other mice from Corsair to Razer and decided to go for the cheaper mouse and I'm happy I have, saved myself about 30 bucks compared to those other mice. delivery was also super quick and Anker's follow-up customer service has been unreal, I wish more companies were like this.<br /><br />*keep in mind that I've only used generic mice that came with computers before this one so I don't have a ton of experience with gaming mice.<br /><br />I've used the mouse for a little over three weeks now and nothing's falling apart, there are no buttons that stopped working, the scroll wheel hasn't gotten stuck, the plastic feet on the bottom of the mouse hasn't started peeling, and there have been no issues with lag or tracking. in short, I received the quality, sturdily built mouse that I was told I'd receive. I think that about covers the potential issues with mouse.<br /><br />now, as for the mouse itself, it's bigger than it seems like in the pictures but it's the perfect size for a palm-grip user like me - and I don't have the biggest hands - and it has a nice weight to it, personally, I thought it was ok even before I put the extra weights in it but I could tell the difference after I put the weights in it and it feels pretty perfect. the biggest and only problem with the exterior of the mouse is that the right side of the mouse is made with a glossy plastic material and it gathers sweat and gunk and grimes up if you don't wipe it off every once in a while. it would've been better if the whole mouse was built with the same material as the plastic on the top of the mouse but it's nothing a little diligence and general cleanliness won't be able to fix.<br /><br />the placement of the buttons are pretty clever, I thought I might have issues with the three buttons placed on top of the thumb rest but they cradle around the top of your thumb without bothering you and makes it easy to reach and press which is helpful during furious FPS play. all of the buttons are fully customizable using the software so you can switch 'em to whatever buttons you want them to be and you have two profile settings you can save so you can switch profiles between different games, which is what I did, or save a profile for gaming and one for just regular internet shiz. the only issues I have is that because of the macro button on top of the scroll wheel, the scroll wheel itself is placed a little lower so you have to bend your finger back a little further than you'd normally have to. it's only a minor issue and it depends entirely on the user but I know some people have issues with stuff like that so I just wanted to give you guys a heads up.<br /><br />onto the software: it's really, really easy. the mouse doesn't come with any installation software but, really, it's not necessary. the download is light and quick and I didn't run into any problems installing it, you can also use the mouse without downloading the software either so if you don't have internet access right away, it shouldn't be a problem. the software is succinct and easy to navigate: there's a section for button customization, polling rate, and clickability or whatever, a section for adjusting the four DPI settings, and a section for the color customization. I'm not that good with software and there are some confusing stuff out there but this one is pretty intuitive and easy to use. I haven't run into any problems switching between profiles either.<br /><br />there's only one thing I really want to let people know about that I think hasn't been mentioned before and it's about the light customization. it's true that you have the option to customize the light to whatever color you want but, realistically, you only get the major colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, green) and a couple offshoots of those like teal and stuff. to be honest, it doesn't really bother me that the Anker logo can't flash azure or whatever but it seemed like something people might want to know about. you can only see the color when you're not using the mouse, anyway, as it's only the Anker logo that changes color and not the scroll wheel or DPI light.<br /><br />in short, the mouse is excellent and comfortable, as is the service because I've never seen another company contact and respond to so many reviews and problems before and if that combination continues, Anker's got a pretty loyal customer in me. also congratulations to you for reading all the way to the bottom. props.<br /><br />tl'dr: mouse is nice and comfortable, service is fast and reliable and friendly as hell, everything was cool.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book was so much better than I had imagined.  I felt her pain and fear and wonder.  I wish she had talked more about what she discovered about the other hikers she met along the way.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|This book is great it helps to get clear on what type of mind set you have. Ron B ya.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. It makes me feel like I really owns horse. The set up of the game is also good. I like the way everything looks.
0425263924|3.0|It was advertised as a Triology, however, at the end we find out that it will be continued maybe in another 4 or 5 books...........no ending to the book.  Now we have to wait for months for the next one to come out and then how long for the following one to come out?????  Very, very upset with this author!!!!!!
B00004YYDI|5.0|plain and simple... one of the best movies i ever saw... Jean Reno - 5 star, Natalie Portman 5 Star, everything about the movie including Gary oldman... 5 star...
B005COO1X6|5.0|My only complaint is that it ended too soon which is really more of a compliment than a complaint. Loved it!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I could hardly leave it down.  Enjoy the story line and was caught unawares of the outcome.<br />Lee Child one of the best fiction writers to date in my opinion.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Enjoying this game. Lots of fun. Kind of addicting at times. And I'm doing this review so I stop getting bugged about it every time I load the game. So good game. Enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wanna play more this game is very addicting. my son and I love playing this together its potshots fun fun fun fun fun
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book was fantastic! Can not wait to read the next two books! The worst part is waiting!! Although I am sure I will reread the first three just before the fourth is released, which is hopefully SOON!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is the first game I got and so far it is still the best. Can not wait to keep playing. Thanks for the app.
B00007KQA3|4.0|It was a well made movie. One that I think everyone should watch considering whats going on in today's world. It shows how quickly our society and rights are being systematically taken away
B007BFSYMS|5.0|just buy it.  you will be so glad you did.  its perfect for traveling or those nights its hard to relax &amp; sleep.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Entwined was good but, not as good as Bared and Reflected. This book had to much sex in it and also didn't solve any problems. I hope book 4 is a better read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Intelligent and gripping historically correct drama. Well cast with the most magnificant set and costumes. I am now hooked and I don't even normally watch TV  as most of it is mind numbing.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Best book ever. I hope Sylvia Day keeps this up, she is a fantastic author!! So much better than 50 Shades!!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|If you want time to fly, pick this game to make it happen. Concentration is so directed the clock has moved so.....fast. I have all 3 games. Each one is equally addictive!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is a lot of fun.  it is not too easy or too difficult.  a great way to pass time when waiting.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Beach Buggy Blitz is your typical racing game that features multiple characters and cars to choose (which you earn via coin collecting).  The graphics are pretty good when you factor the audience which this game caters to.  The only drawback would be that you play the same track but with different features on the track.  All in all, this is a fun game to play if you want to kill some time but don't expect to get hooked on the game.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter's love it.  Sometimes it inspires them to play salon at home with each other and that's why I love it.
B00BX8PG5M|4.0|If you're able to look past the fact that all of the Russians are played by Americans (running from Americans) who, with the exception of William Fichtner, never remotely attempt an accent, you'll find you're in for a real treat with Phantom. A cast of recognizable--iconic even--faces come together for this quiet, smart tale of intrigue. Ed Harris is as tremendous as ever but it's David Duchovny who turns in the most unexpected performance. A very enjoyable film packed with extras that are worth watching, especially in regards to the historical truths the movie is based upon. The metaphysical ending might confuse some but the visuals throughout the film lend to the 'haunted' aspect of the film. I'd say this is more 'U-571' than 'Hunt for Red October' but if you're a submarine fan, this is an admirable entry to the genre. The fact that it was filmed entirely on board an actual Soviet sub made it even more interesting. Enjoy!
0812550706|4.0|Ender's game is an excellent, intriguing story of a young boy brought up from early childhood to be humanity's ultimate weapon in their war for survival.  Well written, exciting, with many unexpected turns, Ender becomes Earth's last hope in a desperate struggle against annihilation.  His own internal struggle against manipulative forces all vying for his favor becomes a double plot and all with a nice surprise at the end.  I highly recommend this book.
B008KW43TE|5.0|It's a digital copy so it's really clear and I love Frank Ocean's voice. I think I've decided to buy digital from now on.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this game is fun. but... once you create a game on the kindle fire you cant delete it and it doesn't always give all the letter in the word
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a really good app. Very bright light. I have used this from finding where a botton roled to jamming at a concert.
B00957T6X6|5.0|It is a page turner and I'm throughly enjoying it.  Also fills in some of the blanks from the TV series.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I'm a huge fan of paper books. I never thought I would like this product, but I'm totally hooked. I still love physical books, but the number of free books available makes this like my own personal public library. I have purchased books, been introduced to many new authors and genres, Mostly I love the free books though.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Reminds me of the concert I attended a few years ago.  It brings me right back to that night.  Thanks.
B0058YPILY|5.0|i love this show and was so excited to get this season.  it is awesome and got here quickly! thank you!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's  a great and fun app to play when your bored or just wanting to play a game on you kindle ipod iPhone or computer ect
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|My quality of tablet is not good enough to fully enjoy this product. It does amazing things but wasn't very satisfying for sketching with my cheap android knock off. It sure has motivated me to get a better tablet though!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very good game,<br />. I would rate it as 4 stars.  Would be nice if you could get clues once in while.  All 3 of my girls really like it  we like to play it together.  I don't know what else to say about it except its fun.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|I can't even get it to down load,it has really good graphics it said,is really doesn't,it's like grand theft auto vice city
B002CPMB9O|5.0|Only a few get rich from the bottom up.its this stolen drug money by their grandparents doing illegal activity or ripn people off is now many families generations later are benefiting from stolen money.its the way it works.Hhm lucky bastards
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great fun on the tablet and reminds me of the Super Mario Kart races, spinning coins and all. Utilizes the tilt feature of your tablet. Worth every penny you don't have to pay for it.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Best read, Gideon and eva have grown so much. Loved it. As I knew I would. Looking forward to reading Captivated by You.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Love the story line.  Four stars is because of the ending! I really expected a stronger ending.  There really was no cliff hanger.  I wanted to be ready to read more of the series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love it This has been the best alarm app ever and free and very easy TO use too!!!! Out of all the apps I would highly recommend you to use it...
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|Their music is so uplifting and light. It's the type of album you will listen to loudly and tap your foot. It reminds me of being at a good family bbq around a fire pit.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|This is a must buy app if you use Picasa. I also use it for presentations since it displays jpg well. Just convert powerpoint slides to jobs.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|Laugh out loud fun which was incredibly hard to put down.  Now looking for the next Sophie Kinsella book to keep me entertained during my lunch hours and cold wintery day
B00C061I3K|4.0|At first the style of the Random Access Memories caught me off guard.  After listening to the whole album once, I felt disappointed.  I guess I was expecting something like Daft Punk's previous works.  But since spent the money on it, I figured I would listen more, and surprisingly it grew on me a lot.  The production quality is impeccable.  Many of the songs became earworms.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I love to listen to both albums together. I think I enjoyed the first album better than the second, but they still have the great drumming and banjo sounds.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I had a nonlinear account but now I can take it around with me so helpfull becausr I use my kindle fire I can't update profits pitcures and the profile extinguish can be hard but besides that I absalutly love it follow me on pinterest at Foley Corrigan-Halpern
B0074VA2T2|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old loves this game.  She plays it a lot and even my 5 year old will play it.  Very cute graphics.
1609617401|5.0|Explains concepts behind the suggested approach very well. I will recommend it to anyone willing to apply the concept to improve their health.
B007DIQC90|4.0|The music reminds me a little of Modest Mouse and I like the flow of the music. They have a distinct way of mixing their music and it's quite enjoyable for any type of mood you're in.
B006T3RM08|5.0|For me was awesome, useful and easy to use.... I get quickly after I made my order. Just buy it if u need it
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is such a fun game!  I have had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to fit things in the bag.  The graphics are super cute and I love how everything looks as it is getting squished.  I just wish there were a child friendly way to play.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Though, I haven't finished reading it.<br />It's been so long. I thank the work of Brandon Sanderson.<br />I haven't felt much difference between him & RJ.
0425263924|5.0|I enjoyed this series a lot. I had to wait 2 weeks for this one to come out and was excited when it showed. I just wished the next one was coming out sooner.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I'm not going to bore people with a review of the movie.  You already know if you like it or not.  The choice here is whether to buy the Blu-Ray (BD) disc or the DVD.  I have seen both and both look really good.  The BD, of course, does provide more definition and a richer look.  The audio of the BD (separation and dynamic range) is, also, slightly superior to the DVD.  But that kind of performance should be expected from a BD.  Ultimately, both discs will provide an excellent viewing experience.<br /><br />So, &#34;push comes to shove&#34;, which to buy?  Buy a used BD copy (only &#34;very good&#34; or &#34;like new&#34;) from Amazon.  I paid about $14.00 (with shipping) and got both the BD and DVD (one to share).  There is a &#34;digital copy&#34; but I never use it if access to it is still available.  The digital copy to download onto your computer or whatever can be time-sensitive.  (I have never understood the attraction of watching a movie on ones computer.)  Also, BDs have a coating on them that prevents the usual mars and scratches that can hamper a DVD.  So, chances are that you'll get a copy that will play just as well as a brand new disc.
B00C9U9YOC|5.0|I think this is a great record and am so happy I bought it.  It's the most cohesive Queens of the Stone Age record so far.  I can easily say that I like this album better than their first album.  Loving it!
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Kanye did it again. I love how he moves the culture forward. He's always thinking outside the box. 5 stars !!!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Having been at the show where this album was recorded (Houston), the sound on the CD is just as vibrant, and clear as being there live. A must for any Beach Boy fan's collection. Bruce Johnston's Disney Girl was no doubt the best I have ever heard him sing.  Wish there was a 10 star rating, this CD pack would get it!!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Its a nice family movie, we enjoyed watching it. My younger brother liked it a lot. Its a cartoon full of emotions.
B00377V6IS|4.0|I have really enjoyed this record.  The musical stylings are preferable in my opinion.  I think this album falls in the middle compared to how well I have enjoyed their other records.  Some are better and some are worse than this album.  I don't think the production quality was super high on this album.  But understand that they don't have the big bucks that other mainstream artists have.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|It is the middle of the Cold War and relations between the United States and the Soviet Union remain tense. The U.S. maintains a fleet of bombers carrying nuclear warheads within hours of targets inside the Soviet Union. And then something goes wrong. What could be viewed as serious scenario was instead created as a satirical black comedy by Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />In this film, a paranoid U.S. Air Force general orders a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. With the Soviets poised to retaliate at any moment, the U.S. President and his advisers scramble to convince the Soviet Premier that it was all a silly mistake and also try to recall the bombers.<br /><br />The film is a good satire of Cold War policies such as mutual assured destruction and the possibility of a \\"doomsday device.\\" All the actors in the film give great and memorable performances.<br /><br />This 40th anniversary DVD set also has plenty of bonus features including a behind-the-scenes documentary and discussions of the sometimes very real nuclear threat during the Cold War.<br /><br />In conclusion, Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is great and classic film. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a Cold War-era film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!!! Although i cant seem to get to the nether...... Althogh i can't figure out how to use realms
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I just love Gideon Cross!!! He is one fine man! Very quick read and enjoyable just can't believe there's more to come!
1423113462|5.0|As many of you know I am in LOVE with Rick Riordans writing! He is back again with a gripping new adventure that I was sure would not disappoint!<br /><br />We are introduced to three new characters who each have their own problems and secrets to deal with. We are immediately thrusted into action from the first chapter, Riordan does not let us down! The trio is whisked away to Camp Half Blood and immersed in the Demi-God culture. We learn the Gods have gone silent, there is a new Great Prophecy, a kid named Percy is missing and a quest to save Hera must be undertook. Is this all too much for the newbie's? I don't think so! Soon we are off on a quest to save Hera from her captors while running into Cyclops', Wind Gods, Ancient Goddesses and more before their time is up.<br /><br />Like all his other books we grow attached and form a bond to the three Demi-Gods...rooting for them on their journey. Jason, Piper, and Leo are each strong independent teens, each with their own powers and secrets. But they must trust in each other to succeed. Through out their journey I found myself guessing their next move, what the prophecy really meant, and where the heck Percy was!<br /><br />The ending leaves you wanting MORE and not wanting to wait a whole year for the next book in the series to come out! (Luckily now you guys don't have to) If you have never read Rick Riordans books I highly suggest you do and that if this one intrigued you start with The Percy Jackson Series because by the time you get to this one you will be fully invested in Camp Half Blood and what the Demi-Gods go through. But if not that's ok too J
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!! I am on it 24/7!! I recommend it for everyone! I am in college and when I am done studying, I am always am on this!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book goes into tangible detail that you can actually SEE make a difference! I have not figured out my man's love language yet, but it is not hard to demonstrate all 5 in the course of a day, not after reading this book!
B009CF7GRY|5.0|This is one of the few movies that is as good if not better than the original! Definitely a must see!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very good graphics and story line. I wish that there were more like this game. This game was very easy to play.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I like the series, was just a little disappointed with the length of the book ENTWINED. Wanted more! I still liked it though. I've seen some nasty and disappointing comments about the book and author, and really it's not all that bad. I just wish there was more! I do understand though, she is writing other seiries and maybe she just wants to work on the next ideas for this one a bit more, and that's okay with me. If it were easy everyone would do it. Think quality people!! I have been reading other books in between, like BEAUTIFUL DISASTER by Jamie McGuire and that is good!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book was ok. I was hoping for something a little more exciting as far as their story goes. It needed a little more drama with all the intense romance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Easy enough for my 7 yo but doesn't feel like a kids game. Very nice and well done. No popups or intrusive ads.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|$hould be free...already is free...wtf is there anything horrifyingly brilliantly ghastly about this calc or have i stumbled upon a wonderful new app?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is super fun and very very good. there should be more rooms though. as of now there are about ten.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Omg let go next floor please this is a very good game ... I want to play more :) when is the next round coming
0307346617|5.0|I have read the book and then seen the movie.  Both were great but I always like the books better they tend to be better in the details.  Max Brooks' attention to detail made it hard for the movie to compete with what I had envisioned while reading the book.  Excellent book!  I hope he has another novel in the works!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Very well written, I highly recommend this book. This book was chosen for the book club that I am in. I can't wait to discuss this awesome book with them. You won't be disappointed!
B004LZFWJO|1.0|Thought it would not limit my playing, but it cuts you off at 50k points. Stick with the free version! There is no extra challenge by getting an extra 25k points which disappoints me.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book, always turning one more page.  It has a decent end considering the nature of a series book. BUY it!
B0053FANRC|3.0|The movie was decent but I have to wait until F & F 7 because articles are saying that all the other movies tie into this one and Tokyo Drift might actually be the end of the series?  Weird.  I like Han in all the movies so in the end it was ok.  I could possibly change my rating after the F & F 7 but we'll see.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You can feed him , groom him , compete , and more. You can train him/her yourself or hire someone to. You can give lessons to others and earn money to buy things for your horse. You can get your horse a treat and pet your horse . It's fun and virtual
0375703764|5.0|I have never read anything quite so unique as House of Leaves. Multiple story lines, an odd but insanely interesting plot, sad times, funny times, ghosts, monsters, sex, an evil house...this review could potentially go on for days trying to tell you what exactly it is about. Its a book and a puzzle. A comedy and a tragedy. A wholesome family and an insane tattoo apprentice. I don't even know. Even after finish this one...I found myself constantly thinking it over, going back to it for re-caps...this one will stick with you for a long time.Love it!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Everyone should own a copy.  You do need a bit of dry humor in your soul however.  This is the third version I own.
B00CSSRPGY|5.0|Have been following her development and marketing over the last few years. This by far is just great. Every selection is a winner. Eliane's vocals just hypnotizes me. Naturally her instrumentals are in a class of her own. She owns this one!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addictive, challenging and fun. I really suggest you try this game out. My son likes it too. We often have to work on them together
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Not Friday Night Light, but still a great album. Most definitely better then yesus. If havent heard yet you missing out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great, love it, but wish it had more levels, hopefully they will make more levels soon. played great on my kindle.
B00C90T4QK|4.0|Most of the songs are typical Buble`, however he seems to slightly veer to another direction with new songs and song choices. Good addition to his collections, but his earlier releases &#34;I&#34; like better.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It works as well as you could expect a cord to work.  The five foot length gives a lot of flexibility as to where it can be used.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love subway surfers ! And I love that they update it like from Rio to Miami and so on ...now it's Paris !  Great job to the peps who made subway surfers :)  (and my little sis loves it ,so it's appropriate 4 7 yr olds) .
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. It fills the void left in a takers heart. Is defanitely worth your time
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I bought the immersion version, I have discovered that I get more from hearing as I read and that reading as I hear brings me much more under standing. I have enjoyed the kindle program that allows text to be read aloud and wish my iPad, Mac, and phone would also, now I double wish they would also. My pleasure in 're-reading Jane Eyre was tripled with the professional narration.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A great game my girls love it so much that they race each other to see who gets the most coins.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I knew it would be a strange movie but it really kept my attention and kept me on the edge, definately recommend especially if your into vampire type movies.
B009AMANBA|2.0|Great director and great actor do not make a great movie, I'm afraid. Nothing new in this movie and very academic direction. Misses some panache!
1439102430|5.0|Great, wonderful, awesome.  I am running out of adjectives!  Keep writing Kathy!  If you stop writing, what will I have left to read?
B008UX8G5A|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed it. I read the book in high school for a project and thus began my obsession with all things Tudor.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|It might be a chick flick but trust me the end will have most guys liking this movie too, if not then you may not have a heart.  Great Great Movie.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Thrilling movie, masterfully interpreted and directed, with no compromise to the politically correct. Agreeable surprise after the controversy around the movie.
0525953728|5.0|Saw this author on 60 Minutes. Thought the book would make a great gift. Went to the website and ordered it. Had the book in 3 days.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Needs more seemed realism that is promised when you are in the passage area I really just want the gems the real reason I'm even writing this
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|I would watch this again and recommend it to anybody I had never even heard of this movie but it was fantastic.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|If there was a 0 rating I would have chosen it. I thought this movie undermined the American family to depict it as crass, vain, deceptive, and disorderly. As if Lacing it with a scene of loyalty moment or a bonding moment over marajuana  will make it funny. I found the \\"comedy\\" insurd rather than true and relatable. Frankly it was an insult and I know the American family has more depth than that. Because  previews didn't suggest how drenched the movie would be with vugarity I was more appauled. Hollywood seems to think we want to see oral sex, teenagers and adults using to f bomb disrespecting their parents, and parents looking for an opportunity to use drugs but not until we've payed for the movie. Your first indicator of this mentality is the opening scene of sex and pornographic sounds.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The included antenna is fine, but I got a 10dbi omni, just a longer version of same, and it really opened my eyes to what more transmission power can achieve, the wifi link is a 2-way communication you know, transmit & receive, 2watts vs the typical 300-500mw (.3-.5 watts) really makes a huge difference, Buy it I hardly think it will disappoint !!
B00632HWOG|1.0|this app would never download onto my tablet, granted my tablet is not a kindle or a nook but nothing from your app store will download!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I checked for better instructions 3x's and still couldn't decide what to do, so I erased it.  It's gone now and I am out!!!
B0090KZDSK|3.0|Was disappointed with the 3rd book, it really didnt go anywhere at all.  Hopefully there will be. A 4th installment
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I have to admit that I was skeptical at first. Being someone who grew up on MGM's Wizard of Oz of course I was in love (and still am) with the characters from that film. To this day I still love it as a classic, at least for my generation. What also made me wonder about this particular film were the mixed reviews it was getting by the media. I always try to avoid reading movie reviews so I don't have any preconceived opinions.<br /><br />I was enthralled from the start! Was happy to see some references to my Wizard of Oz movie. The opening shown in black and white until he lands in Oz. The emerald city looking very much as it did in MGM's version. James Franco gave a good performance as the Wizard, the flying monkey's still as &#34;scary&#34; as they were. Michelle, Mila and Rachel as the Witches very well done.<br /><br />The overall feel of this movie seems to stay fairly true to the original L. Frank Baums Oz Books, which were a bit darker then the MGM Classic.<br /><br />I am a Grandmother now and I see this movie becoming one of my granddaughters favorites when they get a bit older tyo enjoy a film like this. A new classic for a new generation!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super cute game for horse lover's. My kids are able to navigate easily and learn about horse care.<br />Fun. Would recommend
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|A darker turn for Queens, but still incredibly smarmy and rocking just as hard. Just a great time overall. Pick it up and enjoy it on the road.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Each Teacher book has been entertaining and fun. Like each one so far, there has been a certain amount of predictability, and this one left me wanting to tell Teacher his assumptions were leading him wrong.<br /><br />Still have good read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you think outside the box! Some levels are very tricky and quite challenging. Can't wait for more levels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I agree with the majority of the other reviews..this game is entertainingly challenging. Sort of like a mystery and puzzle game in one. highly recommendable. Well except I was only able to play up to the 10th room??? so just as I really started to get into it -its over???? So cannot give 5 stars!
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I went into this movie with high hopes when it came out in the theater, and after I watched it I kept telling myself \\"That was great! It was really...it...looked good and it's an Alien movie by the original director, so I has to be great...right?\\"<br /><br />I even bought the Blu-Ray when it came out.<br /><br />I've watched it three times now, and I've finally decided to face the truth: this movie sucks.<br /><br />An analogy: Imagine you're making lasagna, and you've bought all the best ingredients money can buy: fresh ripe heirloom tomatoes, pasta made from scratch, grass-fed free-range sirloin beef ground, fresh garlic and basil; the works. Then you put it all together with a lasagna recipe written in crayon by a three-year old where all the amounts are wrong and instead of a great lasagna that impresses, it turns out as a dish the depresses: congealed Chef Boyardee from a rusty tin can.<br /><br />Others have gone into more detail, point by point, but suffice to say that despite looking gorgeous with great special effects (except for the plastic geezer), a mostly very talented cast, a huge budget and a tremendously experienced team of film-making professionals that should have known better, the movie stumbles from one stupid moment to the next stupid moment like a drunk hobo trying to stumble down San Francisco's Lombard Street. You'll smack yourself silly with exclamatory statements like \\"Huh? What? Why would you even.....seriously? Really, you would do that? Aw, come on. Now you're just being silly. No seriously, WTF people?!\\"<br /><br />Really, I despise this movie. I hate it for what it could have been, and what it became. It's a huge present wrapped in beautiful multi-colored expensive foil Christmas wrap that when you open it turns out to be a case of yellowed tighty whiteys, pleather stockings and one-ply toilet paper.<br /><br />Do I sound disappointed? Good, then know what I'm getting at.<br /><br />So if it has so many good elements, like the cast, effects, music and presentation, why I'm I giving it only one star? Imagine spending $1000 go to the Olympics to see Greg Louganis perform a gold-medal caliber dive: you sit in your $400 seats right next to the pool, with your $500 camera, sitting with your best friends to whom you've bragged about how this is going to be the greatest performance ever, and you look up with wide eyes teary with anticipation as he walks out on the high board...and he pauses, jumps...once, twice...even higher yet...and............<br /><br />....he mis-steps, flubs over the board, flailing through the air like a spastic monkey to land belly-flop upon the water with a tremendous, moist *splat*.<br /><br />As he floats slowly down, unconscious, to the bottom of the pool you look at the judges table and they score it: zero, zero, zero, zero and zero.<br /><br />So the reason I gave this film one star, is that I couldn't give it a zero.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, I almost forgot: NO SEQUEL!! Because even if it's good, it can't explain the hundred and twenty pages of stupid that passed for a plot in this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|No end. Silvia Day seems to have gotten tired of writing and just stopped the book in the middle of it. Terrible. I thought there would be an end to it. Now we just have to wait for a fourth book.
0811876373|3.0|I have been disappointed and maybe it is just me but even following the directions closely I still can not get my coating on my cakeballs nice and smooth.  =(  Also, shaping is extremely time consuming.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good movie with great action and some funny dialogue. RDJ works Tony Stark very well and is also very funny. Rest of the characters are slightly blander but work together in an overall fun action flick.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|Had to read this when it went viral, but it was outrageous in places by the attitude of the people involved. Think I was too much of a feminist to take this seriously, and yes I read the three of the books and it didn't get any better.....
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Couldn't put it down, Can't wait for the next one. She is a great author and I hate waiting. Will have to see what else she has
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very, very disappointed !! Preordered the book in Oct, 2012 didn't receive it until June 4th, then for her to end it the way she did was very frustrating don't think I will order the next one .
0375842209|4.0|Initially, I found The Book Thief difficult and the language pretentious to the point of interfering with the story. But persistence revealed a fabulous story and a writing style that draws the reader deeper and deeper into the experience. Zusak's style is dry, emotionless and incredibly sparse on description. Perhaps I am used to being spoon fed everything in a book, which made The Book Thief tricky to sink into. However, this 'skinny writing' forces the imagination to fill in the blanks, involving the reader more and more intensely with the world of the story. Once imagination has the idea, the story really flies, entering into consciousness with an intensity and thoughtfulness I have rarely come across.
B007TK77QE|4.0|A very different but good read , awfully sad in places , telling a good story of various characters , whose lives all intertwine in a strong  but ultimately exposing prejudice in all its ugly forms.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I really enjoy this game. tons of fun and time consuming. among one of the better games on my kindle fire that I love.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy books. You will be taken on a journey that you won't ever want to end. Definitely a page turner
B0099114WO|4.0|A clever and humorous look at an old, marital problem, and how the marital partners work it out. Superb actors Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones show that its never too late to communicate! Movie is light, fluffy and believable.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I  love books that when I start reading, I am hooked within the first chapter. This book does that!<br />Enjoy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers, it has amazing gameplay but it wont let me update the game when the update comes out. Otherwise its an amazing game. Hope you get it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good reading. Keeps your interest. Looking forward to the next book in the series. I highly recommend this book
0316247545|4.0|:3 the book is smaller than i expected but is good anyway, (i had higher expectations like more mythology stuff)
0823095223|5.0|this book is great, It tells you everything you want to know about process of making action figures and statues, even making molds and castings. If you'r interested in this kind of thing It's a great book.
B0073COMUW|5.0|Didn't really pay attention to full detail of bulb before purchasing, really caught my attention when turned on.  When they say &#34;Daylight White&#34;, this is absolutely correct, and I really like it. Reminds me of light from a skylight.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This book is one that will have you reeling, asking questions, and wanting to devour more.<br /><br />The story starts with a psycho killer who sneaks into a couple's home in the middle of the night and takes their lives. The only survivor of these murders is Mr.Bjornson, who is too stunned at the loss of his family to be of much help to Max, the detective assigned to this grisly murder case. As Max delves deeper into trying to understanding the psyche of this killer, he discovers that the killer has done this before in other Mid-western towns 10 and 25 years ago. Of the three known sets of murders, only Mr. Bjornson and a three year old boy ever made it out alive.<br /><br />The murder's  motive and peculiar habits is what drives this story. He kills people who he feels as if they are wasting his time. He charges them money as compensation for the time they have wasted. The murder is getting more bold and brash, allowing his death count to keep piling up. The author allows us to know the actions of the killer but still keeps him enough of a secret that we are unsure of what he will do next. This is an awesome, thrilling read.<br /><br />This book is not a waste of your time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A bittersweet but very human story following the lives of people caught up in a net of deception and selfishness.  An interesting read that provides depth of both character and place.  I enjoyed the journey.
0425263924|5.0|This is a really great set of books, I was surprised that I thought the story line was every bit as good as the shades of gray books.  I was surprised there is now a fourth book.  I really hope the author concludes the story line with the upcoming book, It is getting really costly for the reader to purchase books at the rate of $10 to $15 per book with a limited income.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|An introspective novel of male & female characters in an historic, culturally poor, ravaged, war torn country - Afghanistan. Staying largely away from government/political issues directly, this thoughtful novel provides keen insights into the daily lives of human beings living out universal problems within a corrupt system. Hosseini talently writes about the human conditions & hard choices his people have experienced in a very personal manner. I recommend this novel to those who appreciate such.
B008G3N71W|5.0|Failed actress Greta meets a stranger on a train. When he gives her his telephone number, the call she makes is the call of destiny. Under Richard's strict guidance, Greta learns to serve Richard until under his guidance she is ready to serve her art - as a star on the West End stage. There's plenty of - well, everything along the way, girl play, pony play, spanking, a chariot race a la Ben Hur with six strapping girls pulling their male drivers on high-tech carts; Greta even has a fight with a wild billy goat and wrestles the demonic creature to the ground. The story is pure fantasy, erotic fantasy at its best, well written and a real page turner. Wonderful erotica that I would recommend to anyone.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This is a great movie.  If accurate, it reveals things the administration has tried to cover-up.  Sometimes the sceens were switched so rapidly it was hard to understand the dialog or what was going on.
B003YI3D4K|5.0|This Brahms concerto recording is the stuff of legend and the story of how it came about is retold in considerable detail within the sleeve notes, as it was in the previous CD issues and the LP before then. Suffice it to say that Richter was on such form that the recordings were completed far ahead of schedule and with far longer takes than expected leading to a studio recording bordering on a 'live' occasion.<br /><br />The remastered recording is very successful indeed in all the expected ways of extra 'presence' and definition. The improvement in the sound of the following sonata is little less than startling. The recording quality of this hair-raising performance was always inclined to verge on the edge of aggressive but this new mastering has completely tamed the recording aggression while retaining the power of the playing.<br /><br />The Brahms concerto has tremendous forward sweep and energy, very apparent in the opening two movements especially. This is tempered by great lyrical delicacy in the slow movement and a dance-like lilt to the finale. The culminating effect is really quite unlike any other recording that I have ever heard of this work and the performance has long since justified its cult status among discerning collectors.<br /><br />The Beethoven is conceived on a very large scale with absolutely no trace of 'period' sensibilities of authenticity. Not unless authenticity must include what may have been in Beethoven's mind and simply undeliverable on the pianos of previous ages. Here we have Richter unleashed, so to speak. Tempi of the outer movements are very fast but delivered with amazing digital accuracy. The dynamic range has to be heard to be believed. This is certainly a great performance, but probably not a definitive one. It is best thought of as a uniquely powerful statement by an outstanding musician without regard to context other than to produce a white hot experience of music making.<br /><br />This is a remarkable disc with two remarkable performances caught in remarkably improved sound. It deserves to be considered as a very tempting purchase by any serious collector of special recordings and musical events.rkable performances caught in remarkably improved sound.

B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|These cards are amazing! They seem to send the message that you need at just the right time. I consult them daily for guidance and insight. Definitely a great App for a great price, but it's certainly worth much more!
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|A great book to follow Something Borrowed.  An insight into the Darcy character and her completely shallow outlook on life.  The middle was a bit long and seemed to lag, but once Darcy begins to transition and change you can't help but be curious as to where she ends up.
B00968TI64|5.0|The CD version I owned prior to this one wasn't one of those CDs brutalized by the \\"LOUDNESS WAR.\\"  In fact, it was relatively tame, but the instruments - drums, for example - had no punch, definition, or clarity.  This 24KT +Gold CD mastered by the wizard Steve Hoffman fixed the \\"blahs\\" of the original CD.  Full, rich sound - not compressed, no clipping - and Mr. Dio's voice brought out in all of its glory.<br /><br />If you listen to your music via good headphones or you listen on a decent home stereo rig, you will notice a huge difference between this and other versions (here's the one I originally purchased:  [[ASIN:B000002L61 B000002L61]]  This 24KT +Gold CD by Audio Fidelity may cost a lot more, but it is really worth the price if you like to listen closely to your music (i.e. listening is an \\"experience\\" for you, and you don't just have your music on for the sake of mere background noise).
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I rented this movie first and loved it so much I had to purchase it.  This was a good purchase in the fact that it arrived so quickly but I also got an Ultra Violet Digital copy for my PC and tablet.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|a good tune to ride down the road with the top down in the devil hours of the night!!! i love it
B00A757EFW|5.0|I loved this game when I was younger and I still continue to enjoy it today.  I never get bored playing it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. I can't wait for the next levels to come out. The puzzles are challenging , but not so hard that you become frustrated.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love love this series !!! I fell in love with the characters all over again! Can't wait for book 4 and 5!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoyed this episode of Season 3 and I'm looking forward to the rest of this season.  So lovely to have such quality viewing!
B008HK3XU4|2.0|I was really excited to find a case that could stand on its own...so I could watch Netflix. I have had this case for over a month and the padding that the Kindle rests on has stopped working correctly. Which is one of the main reasons I purchased this item. The other problem I have is the corners of the case have already started to fade away. I even spent more money to have the purple case and it's almost completely faded at the corners after a little more than a month of use.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Disappointed in the story.<br />Plot and to long, I watch tons of movies and am a writer.<br />Don't think I would recommend this movie.
1400069289|5.0|This book is very interesting.  The author talks about complicated topics by using simple language and clear logic. Even for me, a non native English speaker, it is enjoyable.<br /><br />This book helps me know more about my personal life as well as the society.  I especially like the part around big data (how Target analyzes customers' habits and targets the profitable market.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|can't wait for the next one!!! I am hooked on gideon! can't wait for the wedding and to see where this leads
B005K17RU0|5.0|Hard to find an EASY to use THOROUGH  AND FREE weather app. Has daily, hourly, current, radar, multiple locations, and warnings all at the touch of one button. No searching around and waiting for each of these things to load. Great app!
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|One of the best tv-series out there and the Blu-ray edition boasts great picture and sound, as expected. Kudos for speedy menus.

B000SW2F6M|5.0|I don't remember when this was film released in theaters but it is a must see. Enjoyed it very much!
B008M87GJK|5.0|It's connecting me to the world. Great feeling to have BBC. Could we expect more live news? Hope to find more live news.
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|The movie has an engaging plot but the vision of the future it captures is the real star here. The human computer interactions depicted were truly innovated when the film was release and are still referenced today. The movie alternates between heavy themes and light hearted almost quirky humor. I found these humorous elements a little out of place and inconsistant with the rest of the film however they do serve to lighten the tone after an intense sequence and give the viewer a chance to relax.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth watching if you haven't.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed it, except the ending.. and now I have to wait even longer for another one<br />to come out... love it..
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I actually really do like evernote. It is a great app for us ameturs... if you look in the permissions it shows that it gives you very, very, little privacy. They can sell anything you put in the app. personally this.isn't an issue, seeing as I'm a middle schooler who uses it fir to do lists and homework. it synge seemlessly to my iphone, kindle,laptop, and even to computers st school. I get that if you have an important job or whatever you might value your privacy, but if your grocery list id read by the team that makes the app, what does it matter!<br />personally evernote is a good app, that when used by the average Joe is not to shabby.  a word of advice: if hour job IS important, be sure to save your notes regularly.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|The only game I'd even consider doing a review for. I love it. It's so enjoyable and addicting. The best part is the huge map. Discovering new places is also really cool.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this very<br />Much always it kept u interested and wondering what next. Was going to take a twist. In it next
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The DVD was perfect, but the program is the best ever. Can't be a better evening than curling up with a great cup of coffee or tea and watching this amazingly written and produced series.
B00969PR18|1.0|Looks like google but nothing happened. The app downloaded its widget but nothing happens when I open it! This makes me sad, if it will not work on a kindle, don't sell it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Enjoy this game a lot. The puzzle can stump you at times back tracking helps if need to back up.
B00884GR0W|5.0|reminds me of skyrim and oblivion when im somewhere away from a console was really amzing for people who love to slay dragons you guys should try pc version of it its way better
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Could have been good, but just was not, boring overall.  when your Smart people are dumb, what can you do
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|After reading the book the movie fell short of expectation. The Reacher series offers a lot of opportunities for movies.
B004UID2LC|2.0|Since the newest freakin update were it shows the names of the video half of the freaking screen is blocked from view it sucks do not download
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I am eternally grateful that Peter Jackson directed The Lord of the Rings and did such an outstanding job. I enjoyed watching The Hobbit, however I think he missed the mark a bit with his interpretation.  The casting is good - although I definitely pictured the dwarves as -- well, a bit more like Gimli in Lord of the Rings.  These dwarves are too cute - and who knew they were Irish?  The thing I remember about reading The Hobbit as a child is that it was innocent.  The adventures were not as dark as Lord of the Rings.  The danger was really the Dragon - and the dark power that was rising was not really dealt with in The Hobbit.  This movie, in my opinion, misses the mark there.  Jackson is trying to set the stage for the darker tale to follow, and inserts too many things into the movie that were not in the book.  I also think it's a mistake to make this sttttrrrreeeettttcccchhh out into 3 movies.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|You've done it again.  Made the best terrible movie of the year!  For fans eyes only!  enjoy you die hards
B0062QRTKA|3.0|Unlike many of the FAOTD's that I have downloaded, this one was a little better than most.  The gameplay is pretty simple (and a tad redundant):  you guide Mo and his people through the parted sea, watching out for mummies and ships that shoot at them.  Jesus and Noah also make appearances and give you special powers.  I found it a bit odd that Jesus can drown in this game along with the drunken followers, but I have to admit I laughed when my six year old son shouted \\"Don't let Jesus die!\\"
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is an incredibly great book, and one that I would recommend to any and all to read. It is not only extremely informative about the ins and outs of Nikola Tesla's career and life story, it proposes profound insight into the understanding of achieving greatness and becoming an amazing human being. A truly great read that everyone should try, absolutely no complaints.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever watched.  I had heard about it and decided to try it myself.  I'm glad I did.  great entertainment.  Great writing. Great acting.  You get involved with the characters and begin to care for them.
B00CFOXBX2|2.0|With the actors, thought the plot would be well acted out, NOT.  Plot nothing new either.  don't be disappointing if you watch
B00A820UF0|3.0|It has some great artwork, but it feels like they held a lot back. Even though I enjoyed it, I paid to much for it.
B00AQSN7HE|3.0|It is a James Bond film with many of the actions you would expect to see. Acting was not as good as you come to know in the series.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Love this, it is perfect for binding game keys and is not too large for my small female hand. I am using it to play Guild Wars 2 and it is a big improvement on just using my keyboard.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Can't beat stalone.  The should never have remade this movie.  Does not improve on the original in any way... oh well
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it can be very addicting though I have to play it at least once a day how ever I think the game is really fun and interesting :)
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Get passed the gimmicky title and buy this book. It offers the best comprehensive strength training program out there to develop a well rounded physique with functional strength. This isn't about bloated semi-body builder muscles (big chest and bi's, skinny legs) or power lifting dead (lifting) heads.  Nor is it about endless circuits with kettle-bells or cables. Go somewhere else for that junk.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This thing is really cool.  It has everything and more that you could want in an galarm clock.  I love that I can have my favorite songs wake me up.  The math problem option is pretty cool too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Waiting for more with such an ending! Love everyone together in this, you all are amazing thank you!  Will be watching
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Keeps crashing and makes me start over! Very disappointed! Other than that very fun game has really nice graphics and really cool animals!:)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put this book down, finished it really fast. The next book in the series can't come fast enough for me.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Once the story starts to unfold it is difficult to put down. Beautiful descriptions and a surprising ending made for a very interesting story.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Expected this to be a great movie because the previews made it out to be so much more.  Just OKAY
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Wonderful! Captures the meaning of true love. A treat for all hopeless romantics, or those who are captivated by love and dream of being in love. There are truly angels surrounding all of us, so be aware of how we treat one another, an angel could be that next door neighbor who mows their lawn st 7 am, and you dont need to get up til 7:30am
B000FC0V3E|5.0|This is an amazing book. I actually saw the movie many years ago with Tyrone Power and Ava Gardner but the book gives you much more insight into the characters minds and emotions.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys a really good in depth story and anything Hemingway writes.
1400069807|5.0|The book has been a great revelation to me.  It goes into much detail in explaining how these three food elements have been manipulated by the food companies until they are so pleasurable to eat as to cause addiction and probably the recent explosion of metabolic diseases such as diabetes.  There's a great deal of scientific background in it, but it manages to hold one's interest because of the enormity of its revelations about what we eat.  The effects of salt, sugar, and fat on the human body are explained in great detail.  Processed food, its dangers, and government involvement in perpetuating its hold on American appetites (at great cost to taxpayers, by the way) are the subjects of this book.  It made me very sorry for all the poisons I've been putting into my body during a long lifetime.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Got less Tom Hardy than I wanted!  Overall long watch, but interesting enough.  Tired of Mr. Shia Lebeouf playing same character

B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|I know this movie got universally slammed when it was in the theaters. I know it is a ridiculous premise. I know, I know, I know.<br /><br />But it is is entertaining as hell.  Go ahead, lower yourself and spend an hour and ahalf watching the best witch fighting in recent cinematic history.<br /><br />It is a seriously fun movie.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Honestly do not know what the hype is all about.  Trying to make the plot suspenseful DID NOT WORK.  Just ok
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an awesome game Would love more levels ASAP.I love games that challenge me.Keep them coming! We need more games like this
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I loved reading this book. It was very easy reading and very suitable for a younger reader. Even though I'm not a &#34;younger reader&#34; it held my interest very well. Theodore Boone is an interesting young man who I would like see in a future novel as an adult attorney. He will be righteous and honest. Not as involved as Grisham's normal writings.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Reason to read it: I read his previous books and liked both.<br />It very entertaining and beautifully written.<br />I will  recommend it to my friends
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I suggest everyone to read.  Thought provoking, fun.  Looking forward to movie.  Thank you tom hanks for doing it!  yes
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Up to the end it kept you guessing. The story was artfully mastered to keep your attention. Definitely one read to add to your collection.
0374203032|5.0|Very different from Sandel's 'Justice', this is a study of the morality and economics of non commodity markets. There are sections on insurance schemes, nuclear waste, sports, unequal access, incentivization, hunting licences, viaticles, life settlements, and wildlife conservation. Some markets work against intuition as with the black rhino population in Kenya increasing due to land reservation from the lucrative market for hunting licenses. After Michael Lewis's 'Moneyball', on base percentage is no longer the value consideration it was as large market teams have appropriated Billy Bean's methods to equalize prices for the capabilities that he values. Other sabermetric considerations are not covered. Selling advertizing space on one's derrier is no longer just a weight loss aphorism. Maybe his next book will cover the silliness of paying for paper carrying bags and the bureaocracy of bottle recycling.<br /><br />The book reflects understanding and descriptive ability in the markets that he analyses. The best aspect is that Sandel is non judgemental, alowing readers to decide for ourselves on the morality of these markets. Procreative license as in China is examined along with rights to have a child. He suggests that ethics might be limited to where the price system breaks down.<br />It's a balanced approach to viaticles and life settlements. Waiting for someone to die is perhaps unpleasant for both parties, but not unethical. The seller obtains money for his health and living needs with the possible drawback of inquiries into why he isn't dead yet. Maybe the question of why, if such items are agood deal for the buyer, are they not purchased by the issuing insurance company is answered on the referenced website, Stiffs.com.<br /><br />Sandel examines the gift business saying that we can't buy friendship but there is a huge market in tokens of friendship. We can buy passes for traffic fast lanes and some doctor's now sell their doctor's cell phone number. Incentivizing kids for grades leads to potential corruption of paying teachers or administrators for their students performance. Refugees are paying for right to asylum. Influence peddling results in unequal access to Capitol Hill. Pollution permitting offsets are like the indulgences sold by the  medieval church. There's municipal marketing where communities sell naming rights to large corporations. Organ donations have long been remunerative. Babies and blood are bought and sold, although he makes the point that money is not always corrupting.<br /><br />Maybe the point is what money can't buy for people who don't have it. Otherwise the book is about surprises of what money can buy. Surprisingly very different perspective from the ethics of his prior book 'Justice'. In general, it seems that buying unequal influence in non material aspects is roughly equivalent to the complaint against commodity markets, although each case is to be considered under its own merits. It's very informative on the economics of the markets that he analyzes, although I wish he would have told me how the man in Florida made so much money by selling his insurance. Little of this is new, but it is edifying to see it collected and analyzed in one book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have played a few of these games where you look for hidden objects and this is one of the better ones.<br />The price can't be beat!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The could not have done better picking out the actors and actresses almost exactly what I imagined.  Nice job for once
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book. It was so funny it had me in hysterics at certain point. It was a refreshing way to tell a not so innovative story about a player who falls in love and acts like a stupid teenager when he doesn't know how to deal. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone in need of a good laugh and an adorable male character!
1400067936|5.0|The point of the book appears to be that life, especially economics, is more random than is obvious. There's lots of research and credit is given to prior work, but not to Bernard Malkiel's random walk idea. Taleb, taking after George Soros, is an admirer of Karl Popper's theories on scientific activity. After citing Popper's thoughtful idea that scientific truth requires the possibility of falsification. There are numerous anecdotes and examples many, but not all of which, are on point.  In an attempt at behavioral economics, he observes that the human brain is not wired for rational thought but for maximum probability of reproduction.<br /><br />Taleb falls for the popular myth that an infinite number of monkeys pounding typewriters will eventually produce the Iliad. It's also popularly applied to Shakespeare. It's not only not falsifiable but intuitively and mathematically fallacious. The situation is mathematically the same as a single monkey typing for an infinite time. The exponential probability of any monkey writing the Iliad goes to zero much faster than time reaches infinity, giving zero probability for the random authorship of Iliad or Shakespeare or even anything intelligible that is more than a very few characters in length. An excel program shows a virtual zero result with a very small number of repetitions.  It doesn't exactly spoil Taleb's contention that life is more random than it seems, but it weakens any contention of total applicability.<br /><br />He concentrates on the mismanagement of statistics rather than mistakes of application to non applicable situations. I think that most problems occur in the application of math and statistics to non statistical causes and effects. Risk is not always a statistical evaluation.<br />Politics now overwhelms economics. Its the endogenous variables that matter. In particular he blames mismanagement of Black-Scholes statistics for the LTCM debacle. It would seem however, that the Russian default that was a political phenomenon not a mathematical one.<br />Today's (6/20/13) meltdown is due to a Bernanke speech rather than any random event.<br /><br />The book mostly relates to finance, although aspects of human behavior are also cited. He favors Popper's contention that theory is never right over Auguste Compte's positivism. George Will sounds smart while Robert Shiller really understands market. We see only winners. It's noise if less than daily average. We need to understand confidence levels. Contrary to much self help market advice we can't fight our emotions. Taleb doesn't tell us how to take advantage of randomness. for the times that it does work. He says he looks for debacles. The book is well worth reading even if a bit long for the point of things being more random than they appear. Taleb is very convincing that there are no gurus in the world, but that includes himself.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|After you get to the harder stages, it is very difficult to reach the points stage within the 1 minute time therefore I tend to give up on it and lose interest in the game.

B00846REIS|5.0|What I appreciated most of this book -HOT sex scenes aside- was that it's a story about two normal, screwed up people trying to have a functional relationship. Gideon is oh so perfect and the fact that this man goes above and beyond to make things right and communicate, no matter how much he struggles at it, had me swooning through the whole book. However, I must admit I found Eva to be annoying and immature at times. I can't believe I delayed this book off my list for so long. I'm going back for more Gideon Cross!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can hardly wait for the story to continue for Gideon and Eva.  I want more, so much more to be known.

B008JFUTT0|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> 'Searching for Sugarman' is a documentary about a one-of-a-kind story that will never happen again. It's both bizarre and unusual as well as inspirational and uplifting.<br /><br />Back in the early 70s, a young folk-rock artist named Rodriguez (aka Sixto Rodriguez), put out two record albums which went nowhere on the U.S. charts. Faced with the prospect of supporting his family, Rodriguez gave up his musical career and became a construction worker, settling down in Detroit.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to him, those two albums made their way to South Africa, where he became a sensation amongst opponents of the Apartheid regime. In South Africa, through the 70s and 80s, Rodriguez was considered \\"bigger than Elvis\\". Somehow, no one in South Africa learned anything about Rodriguez and a rumor that he had killed himself on stage, became accepted as fact.<br /><br />In the late 90s, a couple of musicologists in South Africa began making inquiries out of curiosity, as to Rodriguez's history. After a long, frustrating search with no concrete results, one of those searching for their unknown idol, came upon a reference to Dearborn (Michigan) in the errant troubadour's lyrics. One clue led to another and before you knew it, the South African investigator was able to locate Rodriguez's first producer.<br /><br />To his amazement, the producer shocked his inquisitor by informing him that Rodriguez was still alive. Soon Rodriguez's daughter got in contact with the South African researchers, and filled them in as to her father's history.<br /><br />The great part of the film is that Rodriguez was invited to play live concerts in South Africa. His daughter commented that they expected a small group to show up but were completely flabbergasted when a sold-out crowd of thousands, showed up for her father's concert. Rodriguez himself, was amazed at the reverential reception that was given to him, but wasn't at all nervous, playing before all these adoring fans.<br /><br />How this unknown musician in the US, could have been such a sensation in South Africa, without anyone here in the US knowing about it, seems bizarre, in the age of the internet. But of course, all this happened before the internet was introduced.<br /><br />Most of those in the music business who had tried to make Rodriguez into a household name, were mystified as to why he never took off in the US. My opinion is that despite a great, unusual voice (in the spirit of Cat Stevens) and some catchy tunes and thoughtful lyrics, his arrangements seem a bit dated and corny (even back then). With what sound like synthesized strings, most of the songs hark back to the early 60s, with Rodriguez trying to meld a Dylanesque sensibility with Motown. It comes off as a bit old-fashioned and did not appeal to an audience who were more enthralled with the unencumbered folk or pop rock, that was popular at the time.<br /><br />We learn at the end of the documentary that Rodriguez went back to South Africa three more times, for more live concerts. We also learn that Rodriguez was extremely generous, giving most of the proceeds of those concerts to his friends and family. Rodriguez never received any royalties for all the sales of his music in South Africa, and it appears both bootleggers and a few unscrupulous music producers back in the US were to blame.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that Rodriguez never really found his muse later on, and hasn't taken up composing again. His inspiration was squarely grounded in his youth. The love for his music in South Africa remains, as the denizens of that country feel a great nostalgia for their own youth, where they recall their exciting days of protest, against an oppressive political and social system.<br /><br />This is a real 'feel-good' story which will make you smile as an extraordinary man is given his due, later in life, when he least expects it.re all these adoring fans.<br /><br />How this unknown musician in the US, could have been such a sensation in South Africa, without anyone here in the US knowing about it, seems bizarre, in the age of the internet.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy spending time with my Pinterest friends and to see what they are collecting. I guess it kind of keeps a person from being a hoarder. Maybe this is hoarding . I don't know but I sure do enjoy spending time on Pinterest .
B003VXMMTK|2.0|I'm a huge fan of British Dramas, but this one was so depressing and terribly sad. If it was a Shakespeare work, it definitely would have been a tragedy. :(
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great visual effects, if you found the book hard to stick with, the movie does a pretty good job getting the plot in
0061537969|5.0|Loved this book. Makes you look at your dog in a new light.  Ordered this for my daughter after reading it myself.
B00000JRTX|5.0|Maybe it's just my brand of humor, but I really like this movie.  Good cast, good story, memorable quotes.  Only drawback is Andie McDowell is a little wooden.  Otherwise, perfect.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Very addicting and very fun. This is what I want in a game. Happy as I could ever be.  Thanks.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great read. I recommend it if you like shades of gray books. Warning I had to read the rest of the books very quickly. I was hooked.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|If you like historical fiction you'll like this book.  It is similar in some ways to the Help, but takes place at an earlier place in history.  The book came quickly and in good condition.
0316056863|1.0|I read everything. Fiction, Non-fiction; doesn't matter. And I have one rule...I HAVE to finish every book no matter how boring, how uninteresting. I've never broken my rule until now. God bless Tina Fey but I only made it to page 115. I really tried to enjoy her life stories and attempts at humor but the book was just plain boring.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love it. Cannot stop watching. Greatful to have on Amazon Prime subscription and be able to watch anywhere on my ipad

0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg- regardless of how she got to the top- knows women leadership when she sees it. She understands women and has put her research into the book. While it's true that Sandberg's actual content is limited to about 170 pages, the notes she includes are important and worth looking into if a particular part of the book struck a chord with you. This definitely isn't a book she wrote quickly to make money; it's a thoroughly researched masterpiece to illustrate some of the hurdles women face in the workplace and what they can do to change them.<br /><br />Be the Master of your own destiny. Be the change you want to see in the world. Lean In. Whatever phrase you want to use, Sandberg emphasizes that women need to speak up. I beg you to get the book, read it, and pass it on to a young woman you know. Encourage tomorrow's women to be leaders and take action for their own futures and the next generation may just be the one that levels the field.<br /><br />Check out Cathryn Michon's review (from March 22, 2013). She's completely hit the nail on the head for this book.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book was very good, I had trouble getting through it at first but this is not the type of book I normally read.  Once I got to a certain place I was able to speed right through it.  I would recommend this book.

0765325950|1.0|This has been the 2nd biggest literary disappointment of my entire life*.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />I am not sure why this book took so long to get out as it is OBVIOUSLY merely a collection of notes thrown together and not fleshed out.  This book should have been called \\"Shards Of Loose Ends Not Tied Up\\".<br /><br />And the ending of this book is so bad my dog could have written a better one.  And as a matter of fact, here are her suggestions on how this book should have ended.<br /><br />It should have taken a few chapters to have tied it all up at the end of this book.<br /><br />One chapter to have everyone get home, start cleaning up their respective towns/cities/steddings/villages and get settled back in there with planting, watering, organizing, harvesting, killing off any laggards for the Shadow, hunting down Machin Shin, etc.<br /><br />One chapter to show us 2000 years down the road when the world has cleaned up and everything is running smoothly.<br />  The Gai'Shan can be the new gardners of the world having absorbed the Tinkers and maybe be Ogier trained...<br />  The Cha Faile can be the new guard of the world acting as police and arbiters of problems having absorbed the Aiel...<br />  A NEW source of power has been located...<br /><br />One chapter for 3000 years down the road after the breaking...<br />  The Sharran can be the new Aiel...<br /><br />For a series of books that have prided itself on the theme of \\"This has all happened before and this will all happen again\\" as well as \\"Everything is a cycle\\", \\"We are playing roles here\\" and all manner of that stuff, this was the ending:<br /><br />  They beat the Shadow and went home.<br /><br />What an utter and complete disappointment.  If this is how Barry Sanderson does his readers...I will NEVER pick up one of his books.  Ever.<br /><br />*The first being the failure of the author to finish the series:  The War Against The Chtorr by David Gerrold.
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|So encouraging and full of the presence of the Lord! I have always enjoyed music from Darlene and the Hillsong folk, this album is another amazing addition!
B00BD07SGU|5.0|I came across Amorphis through Amazon's suggestions and sound samples.  I find this service extremely helpful as I have an insatiable taste for music.  I listen to all sorts of music but rock and metal are my bread and butter.  I am now in my 50s but have no interest in mellowing and I love the fact that there are so many bands out there producing music but much of it is not available in standard music stores and even if it is you cannot try it before you buy it.<br /><br />Circle is currently the only album I have by Amorphis but what drew me to it was the intensity of the music, Tomi Joutsen's strong, deep melodic voice and the medieval folk overtones to a number of the songs.  Awesome!
B000SP1SEO|4.0|cool movie, cool stars, cool script and cool production!  can't say enough about it, and it was as fun as the first time I saw it.

B008JFUPK8|4.0|DC Comics has rivaled and preceded Marvel Comics for many decades with its roster of super heroes and is now attempting to reestablish their greatest character, Superman. Having been previously depicted in movies and television, Man of Steel is the biggest production to date.  Is it any good, and is it better than Superman Returns?  Yes and yes.  Despite a darker tone, (courtesy of the creative tandem of producer Christopher Nolan and writer David Goyer from The Dark Knight films and director Zach Snyder of Watchmen), this adventure is an entertaining action piece with a deep psychological subtext.<br /><br />The planet Krypton is dying, and scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara launch a spacecraft to send their newborn son, Kal-El, to a promising world, Earth.  General Zod (Michael Shannon), whose attempted coup is thwarted, is banished into a wormhole.  When Krypton is destroyed, Kal-El lands on earth, and through a series of flashback vignettes, we see the school boy named Clark struggling with growing pains and the values instilled by his adoptive human parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane)  who try to hide his superhuman strength and abilities.  As an adult, Clark (Henry Cavill) takes a series of jobs and remains anonymous, off the grid until odd reports begin to circulate of a mysterious man who saves lives with remarkable powers which brings reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) hot on his trail.  The setting shifts from the cornfields of Midwest America to Metropolis.  As General Zod reappears to claim earth for his race, the stage is set for a grand battle with the fate of the world in the hands of a true blue hero.<br /><br />There are some fine moments such as the young Clark befriending a former bully and being repaid in kind.  There is the tornado scene that brings Clark's non-use of his powers to a turning point.  Later, when the military first meet Superman and question his intentions, he responds by rescuing scores ofpeople and is vindicated in a touching moment.<br /><br />This Superman (with more than a passing parallel with Jesus) is depicted as an emotionally vulnerable soul, and although he possesses great powers and invincibility, he does feel pain especially when meted out by his own kind.  The whole film is ultimately a moral struggle and contrast between two fathers and whether their son's powers are meant for good or to be kept hidden no matter what the cost.  It's also about his personal journey to find his purpose amid a normal life and search for his origins.  Can he embody the best of both worlds, and to what lengths will Superman go to save humanity?<br /><br />Cavill is quite convincing as Superman, certainly an improvement on Brandon Routh's turn in Superman Returns.  Adams shows a thoroughly capable yet vulnerable Lane, a strong reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner to boot!  Her scenes with Superman work quite well especially in the quieter, intimate moments which one hopes will lead to much more in future installments.<br /><br />The supporting cast excels.  Crowe lends gravitas to a subordinate role, and he registers every time he appears. Diane Lane is good as the compassionate Momma Kent.  (Ironically Lane starred in Hollywoodland about TV's Superman, George Reeves).  Costner makes a strong impression as the resolute, adoptive dad who is willing to risk his life for a principal.  Laurence Fishburne is a more three-dimensional Perry White, and Christopher Meloni is effective as a hardnosed military commander.<br /><br />Special visual effects have come a long way since 1978's Superman when the slogan was, \\"You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!\\" Some of the effects show incredibly fast motion which makes you wonder how cool it would be to realize such DC Comic characters as The Flash.  While Hans Zimmer has the appropriate, heroic musical score in place here, John Williams truly memorable theme song is a hard act to follow.<br /><br />The action is not the cartoon variety; people do get hurt and some perish.  Regarding that final battle in the streets of Metropolis (previously depicted in Superman II), enough already!  We've seen The Avengers decimate New York City and The Transformers wreak havoc on a massive scale.  These scenes are becoming old hat (even in a post 9/11 world), and are starting to seem repetitive overkill.  Don't get me started on the obvious product placement; when it begins to be noticeable, it becomes annoying.<br /><br />Perhaps the only disappointment here is the lack of much humor or lightheartedness. There are a couple funny moments; the film could have used a few more.  One hopes a lighter tone is in store for the next chapter. Maybe we will see Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen who are both missing here. You barely see Clark Kent get his gig at The Daily Planet before the credits roll.  Oh, and contrary to the Marvel films, do not bother staying through the credits in hope of a post credit tease.  The film's greatest accomplishment is setting a strong foundation for the next Superman adventure and possibly the beginnings of a Justice League of America (emulating Marvel's The Avengers).  Wouldn't that be cool?
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It was a good book but there are too many cliffhangers. Also this was supposed too be the last book in the trilogy. Now Sylvia is coming out with 2 more Crossfire books. Wth?

B005LAIIN0|4.0|Brad Pitt has gone from youthful sex symbol to versatile actor and producer.  His biggest project to date is this filmic adaptation of Max (Mel's son) Brooks' novel, World War Z, chronicling a massive, worldwide zombie apocalypse. For a subgenre that has ranged from classic horror, (Night of the Living Dead), to science fiction, (Resident Evil), to modern updates, (Dawn of the Dead remake), and parodies, (Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead), this film represents a rare depiction of the zombie invasion as a global, mass annihilation.  Previously, these films focused on a small group of survivors (TV's The Walking Dead) with a news blackout and no idea as to the magnitude of the infection.  After publicized problems with the screenplay and director Mark Forster's (Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland) rough cut (particularly a climactic battle scene), a new ending was shot, and the result is a remarkably engaging film.<br /><br />Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), ready their two daughters for school and get caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and panic sets in amid an invasion of zombies who are bent on mindlessly attacking and converting humans into the undead.  As cities fall worldwide, the infection spreads exponentially with startling speed as the family flees to Newark for supplies and a lifeline from Gerry's former UN boss, but while the family finds a brief refuge aboard a US Navy ship, Gerry is called into service to find the source of the infection or risk having his family kicked off the ship as non-essential personnel.  Tracking down random clues across the globe in such disparate locales as South Korea, Israel, and Wales, the trail for a cause and potential cure proves challenging as time runs out on humanity.<br /><br />In many ways, this film, which shares much in common with pandemic tales as Contagion, Outbreak, and The Andromeda Strain, is more a thriller than horror, and that's not a bad thing.  Rather than relying on gross out murders and graphic blood spattered effects, this film looks at the bigger picture without sacrificing the more intimate moments of sheer terror, not an easy balance.  Don't let that PG13 rating fool you!  Some scenes are suspenseful and agonizing as the threat of zombies is ever present.<br /><br />The film, particularly in the Newark apartment scenes and an unbearable moment of truth at a World Health Organization lab, is like one big funhouse ride where the scares are just around the corner.  Other memorable set pieces include the opening pandemonium in Philly, which is well crafted and builds to an alarming level, a walled in city of Jerusalem stunningly challenged by a growing sea of undead, and perhaps the best moment, a horrifying passenger plane flight from hell that starts innocently enough but quickly devolves into an impossible situation.<br /><br />The film takes the scary notion of fast running zombies from 28 Days Later and adds even more lethal traits as in their ability to not only swarm like insects, but to hurl themselves with great ferocity at their intended victims even through car windshields.  Their victims aren't devoured as in other films, but rather a bite turns them into more zombies almost instantaneously.  They are also real sensitive to sound as Gerry learns at the worst possible moment.<br /><br />What distinguishes this film above most others is its smarts.  The script, while written by many hands, still shows an intelligent approach to a devastating crisis, and the dialogue never sounds phony.  Further, the film is like one big mystery with nature's clues in full view waiting for Gerry to piece together a solution.  Some of the plot points are a bit open ended and push the limits of plausibility, but things move so swiftly and convincingly, that most won't mind.<br /><br />The supporting cast is effective in brief roles with a strong turn by Daniella Kertesz as a soldier.  But this is Pitt's show,and he is the right leading man who has the presence and charisma to carry even a zombie film. Being able to improvise and display cool under pressure, he is the ideal savior that the world needs.  Perhaps his Gerry is guilty of being too perfect, but he does it so well.<br /><br />(It is amusing to note that Gerry and his family become guardians of an orphaned boy, and one wonders if Angelina Jolie was smiling at the parallels with her and Pitt's real life, nuclear family.)<br /><br />With a mega-budgeted production, the CG effects are a standout especially when creating the hoards of zombies, and there are many effective camera shots with some particularly startling, overhead views.  There is also great use of sound effects that add to the visceral chills while the brooding, pulsing music score (Marco Beltrami) complements the tension.<br /><br />A thrill ride from beginning to end, World War Z is a thoroughly entertaining, scary epic that takes the zombie lore and heightens the stakes with an impressive budget and a star turn by an actor/producer at the top of his game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent book I recomend it definately very easy reading and very entretaining too I read the three of them and enjoyed them
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The original plan was for it to be a trilogy. The author decided to drag this story out and despite her claim that it is to fully capture the characters' complex stories, there were at least 150 pages that could have been cut from this book. Do you ever watch a TV show and know that another season is completely a dishonor to the show and drags out the characters for no artistic reason but rather only for profit? This is kinda like that.

B003SJ4VJ6|5.0|Former Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) runs into difficulties as he attempts to complete his memoirs. His longtime aid turned ghost writer, died in an apparent accident. The publishers scramble to bring in a replacement, as to avoid any delays in publication. Enter Ewan McGregor as the unnamed replacement author, who is tasked with finishing the memoirs in a reduced time-frame, despite his inexperience in writing \\"political\\" memoirs.<br /><br />Due to Lang's scheduled speaking engagements, McGregor's character travels to the small town on Martha's Vineyard where Lang and his entourage are staying. As he begins reading the draft of his predecessor, he is bored by the writing, and realizes that he will have to start the narrative from scratch. During his interviews with Lang, he begins to suspect the Prime Minister of withholding some of the crucial facts from his past. He also begins to question the mysterious death of his predecessor.<br /><br />Lang's entire team is soon caught off guard by the accusation by his former Foreign Secretary of authorizing the illegal seizure of accused terrorist to be handed over to the American CIA for torture and questioning. This forces Lang to refocus his energy from the memoirs to repairing his reputation and defending himself against the politically harmful accusations.<br /><br />Of course, controversy sells. It is no surprise then that the publisher requests the memoirs be completed within the coming weeks instead of the original time frame. As the Ghost Writer investigates further into the life of Adam Lang, he begins to uncover inconsistencies in his claims. There are connections between Lang and an American professor (Tom Wilkinson) who is rumored to have worked for the CIA. As the Ghost Writer delves deeper into the life of Adam Lang, his is thrust into a conspiracy that spans nearly four decades. In the end, he must discover the truth behind the lies of Adam Lang before his meets the fate of his predecessor.<br /><br />The film is based upon the novel The Ghost by author Robert Harris, who also co-authored the screenplay with the film's director, Roman Polanski. This is a taut thriller, with quick pacing, genuine characters, and a twist ending that you won't see coming. The entire film feels cold and disconcerting, in thanks largely to the production design, cinematography, and minimal score. The plot generally stays faithful to that of the fantastic novel, echoing the political allusions to actual Prime Minister Tony Blair and his controversial relationship with the United States. This is a first rate thriller and possibly one of my favorite book to film adaptations.><br />The film is based upon the novel The Ghost by author Robert Harris, who also co-authored the screenplay with the film's director, Roman Polanski.

0743277708|5.0|This is the book that taught me to read.  I'd read books before, but I hadn't been absorbed by them, hadn't been taken into the world within the pages before.  Here is mythology.  Here are descriptive passages that vibrate with life.  More than that, here is a story of heroes.  Yes, they're rabbits, and beautifully, genuinely so.  But though this book is approachable by children--I was eleven when I first read it--it is a story about characters struggling to survive in a world full of promise, but with no guarantees.  Since my first time through, I've read it on average once a year since--going on thirty times now.  With each time, upon reaching the last line, I feel a tug to turn back to the first sentence and start again.<br /><br />Review by the author of [[ASIN:0983687242 A Draft of Moonlight]]

B00846REIS|5.0|\\"There were thousands of women in New York alone who could replace me in his life, but there was only one Gideon Cross.\\"<br /><br />The Crossfire saga is as good as it gets as far as whirlwind romance, all-consuming story line and captivating and unforgettable characters.  Best experienced, The Crossfire series is Gideon's and Eva's epic love story, both broken, flawed and co-dependent and yet so determined and relentless for their elusive happily-ever after.  Follow them through sky-high ups and rock-bottom lows as their relationship is tested with demons from their pasts, envy, jealousy, secrets and lies.  Yet their biggest obstacles will always come from within.  It's their journey of self-discovery and fulfillment and about pushing all limits and surrendering it all for love.<br /><br />Books must be read in order:<br />Bared to you (Book 1)<br />Reflected in you (book 2)<br />Entwined with you (book 3)<br />Untitled (book 4)<br />Untitled (book 5)<br /><br />Bared to you (book 1), follows Gideon and Eva from their first meeting.  Upon meeting Eva, Gideon has a singular goal and a very straight forward approach:<br />\\"Because I want to f~  k you, Eva. I need to know what's standing in my way, if anything.\\"<br /><br />He only intended to seduce her... but before he knows it he is all caught up in wanting more.  Their budding romance is electrifying, beautifully depicted with plenty of sinfully steamy sex scenes.  But they are wounded souls with much to overcome; vindictive villains, surprises and shockers.  Their against-all-odds love was just as spellbinding to read this third time around.  Book 1 does not have a cliff-hanger ending, instead is leads you right to book 2 for the continuation of their saga.<br /><br />Hero: Gideon G. Cross/28 years/Founder-Ceo of Cross Industries/Black hair/blue eyes/$$$$ (New worth $12 BIL.)/Forbes #25<br />Heroine: Eva L. Tramell/24 years/Ad agency assistant-recent College graduate/Bland hair/gray eyes/$$$<br /><br />Gideon Cross is my ultimate hero. His combination of larger-than life personality and uncanny good looks; enigmatic and elusive; intense and in-control; broken and flawed; ruthless and unyielding, yet when it came to his Eva vulnerable, relentless and human.  Six words to describe Gideon: Unforgettable, intense, ruthless, enigmatic, dominant and captivating.<br />\\"He wasn't just beautiful; he was... enthralling. He was the kind of guy who made a woman want to rip his shirt open and watch the buttons scatter along with her inhibitions. I looked at him in his civilized, urbane, outrageously expensive suit and thought of raw, primal, sheet-clawing f~  k~ng.\\"<br />***<br />\\"There was something sweet in watching him pull himself back together, restoring the façade he wore for the world while I knew at least a little of the man beneath it.\\"<br /><br />Like it or not, but Eva Tramell is everything Gideon needed.

B002ZG997M|5.0|I really love this movie, in fact I watch it over and over again, Denzel Washington is such a fine actor, everything he does is good.This movie is set in the furture after some sort of war, and food and clothing and water are hard to come by and the people trade one another for what each wants and needs. Another good movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|An eye opener and not to be missed--after all these years we have been trying to understand their culture,so different from<br />ours--- and are failing at this so miserably.  Lore
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|The product is good, is you only want  own the movie. you don't get much more. it would be cheaper to only buy a digital copy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it! Can't wait to read more!  I'm liking this series just as much as 50 shades of gray!! :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I went into reading this series with no expectations and I really honestly loved the third book Entwined with you!!!  I love the turn that Gideons and Eva's relationship went and I also am super pumped there are going to be more books to read!!  I know that some people were really upset and I was reading the reviews and I almost for a second debating even reading the third book because of all the bad reviews but I was very pleasently surprised and I never write reviews but I really had to write this one to let other people know that it was just as good as the other books and even better!!!<br />Enjoy!!
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Very usefull to help a beginner or even a medium trainer to get in better fit. Its totally worth it.
0525478817|5.0|I was really happy with this book, once I got it on my hands I couldn't put it down, John Green is really a gifted writer, I'm looking forward to reading more of his books.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|I like most of the songs on the album.  Some I like more than other, but can say that there are any songs that I just hate.  If you like alternate modern music then this is worth listening to.
B008J34466|3.0|I have every P!nk album and this one is my least favorite.  I love a couple of songs, but most of them are just ok.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Just like the title says I love this game. If you want to be like the hundreds of other people who love it you will get this game and figure out why.
B000PC0U1W|1.0|the sound was recorded so low on this disc that I turn the volume up all the way to 100 setting on my tv and you still can barely hear it.I'm not sure what to do with it.I have a friend with a video business,I plan on asking him if he has any ideas.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The book tells you what happened from each character's point of view. It was ABOUT IT DOSENT MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE
030758836X|2.0|Twice now I have started and tried to make myself finish this book but I just can't do it. I hate not finishing a book once I've started it but I just can't get into this story.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I love this book!!! This book is very interesting because a lot of unexpected things happen. I gave this book 5 stars because  I believe that it deserves 5 stars!! I highly recommend for you to get this book if you are into interesting books that will engulf your mind!! This book was so good that it only took me like 4 day to finish!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love the game but you can't move game data from one unit to another if you need to replace it. Level 8 is way too long. Too much time to reach required meters to move on to next level. Gets monotonous if you don't have unlimited coins and gems. I choose not to get the cheat.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a great author with quite a imagination.  Read 3 of her books now, with no regrets.  Keeps you interested until the end
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|Spoiler alert! Goodbye, Matthew. We'll miss your blue eyes and bright smile. The character was well done and the actor who played him (sorry, I forgot his name!) was really good in role. Be<br />t of luck in his future endeavors!:)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun,really makes you use your head,can be very addictive and a great way to pass time in a car or on break!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I think it's really fun. It just gets harder and harder. That's what I love about it. But it gets really annoying. Because you see when it comes to the railroad it slows me down so I fall off.  So not cool. But fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Game is easy, fun, and has awesome graphics.  Enjoyable no matter your age, especially if you.'re a fan of horses or enjoy &quot;raising games&quot;
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|The differences between 'Before' and 'After' have never been so obvious, as they are in this new blu version.  i can hardly wait until I've been able to enjoy 'all' of the Next Generations re-mastered with equally loving care.  As a sci-fi buff, I'm hoping to see Stargate SG 1 handled as well.  These are classics and should be treated as such.  All are worth the wait.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I've been a Bloons fan since 3,and,overall,5 was no disappointment. So,when I saw this Portable version,what did I think? \\"NINJA KIWI,JUST SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!!!\\"  Now,a few Pros and Cons:<br />Pros:<br />Has more Agents<br />Has more Tracks<br />Has In app purchases,for us impatient people (I'm lookin at you,me!)<br />IS PORTABLE<br />Has a \\"Lab\\". You spend tokens(Gained from beating Tracks or just buying them) to upgrade things in here,like popping power,starting cash,starting lives,pierce,MOAB-like bloon hitpoints,etc. Most of these are tiny,But DO stack with the Village Buffs.Very Useful<br />Saves your rank in the device,not your account<br />The sounds be all good n' stuff<br />Cons:<br />Is missing the Bloonchipper and a few tracks,(BUT HAS VERSION EXCLUSIVE TRACKS,DON'T FORGET THAT...bro)<br />Instead of unlocking Sandbox by leveling up,you have to spend $5,000 Monkey Money...HA! I got that with my Super Deluxe Awesomeness Pack IAP.<br />Miscellaneous:<br />Get this app.Now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It is much better than temple run! I would right down pros and cons but I can't find any cons
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I loved this movie when my kids were young and now I am introducing my grand daughter to it as well!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its cool fun and it teaches childern how to care fore horse and learns about how to compete and its plain out awsome
B00280LYIC|4.0|I started the hero's of Olympus series before this one, and I love them. Now, I'm starting to love this one. Percy has got me deep in Greek mythology.
B0001I561E|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when my kids were little and I am loving introducing my grand kids to it as well!!!
B007FIY3VW|5.0|I thought I would have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a GOOD app that would allow me to edit Microsoft Word documents.  I'm a writer, and ever since I bought my Kindle Fire, I have dreamed of being able to put my novel drafts on it and take them anywhere.  Now I can do just that!  I no longer have to print and lug around paper drafts!  THANK YOU, OLIVE OFFICE!<br /><br />My only complaint is that I can't edit PowerPoint documents, only view them.  But that's no biggie, really.  Maybe they will update this app soon to add that feature.  If not, that's okay.  I still love this app!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing well written and a great read. Bring on the final book I can't wait to find out what happens!!
0131480057|5.0|The foreword to this volume is by Tim O'Reilly. In it he states that an earlier incarnation of this book, now in its fourth edition, served as the benchmark for what his own System Administration book would have to strive for in terms of content and accessibility.<br /><br />I'm not a rabid consumer of O'Reilly books. Some of them are the best games in town, some not worth the paper etc. But in this case he is echoing my own sentiment with respect to the Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook (4th Edition).<br /><br />This book teems with useful advice honed over four editions, more than 20 years of experience half a dozen different flavors of the \\"unix-like\\" operating systems available, from Solaris through a rainbow of Linux variants to AIX, the mutant elephant in the room.<br /><br />The tone is not always agnostic, but if there are dissenting opinions to the view being expressed, they are presented and attributed. I like that approach a lot. Too much of the Sys Admin dialectic is needless (and all to often ranting) evangelism of this or that O/S rather than a cogent discussion of the matter at hand. Here, all voices are heard.<br /><br />The range of subjects covered is, to these eyes, a definitive and complete set, making  this book a swiss army knife for the Sys Admin.<br /><br />Recommended.
B002OTPBI6|3.0|A totally different theme with good acting throughout ,fine locations and good photography.,you should be aware that not every product that you sell is worth 17 words in a revue, or many people refuse spending their time ,putting 17 words together. I think if you didn't have the 17 word deal, you would get  A-HELL-OF-A-LOT,more revues.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Awesome game. But freezes up on my LG smart phone. But on the kindle it works like a dream and super fun. Hasn't gotten old yet.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book was ok. The author didn't please me with extending this story for another 2 books as I've read.  I was looking forward to finishing the series.  I'm not sure if I will get the next books.  There are many wonderful authors out there with great books to read and I want to read them.
B0016CBHXA|2.0|It appeared to be a bootleg.  Terrible quality. It was expensive for an old movie and definitely not worth it.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I was tired of replacing the &#34;cheaper&#34; chargers.  This one appears to be very well constructed.  Good tight fit in the socket
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Gillian Flynn's characters, always deeply flawed and emotionally unstable, are as addicting as they are tragic. I started with Gone Girl and am working my way backwards. It is a journey, to be sure. I hope to see more out of Flynn in the future. I also hope no one murders the film adaptations.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|it had a good story but man oh man it was very slow moving compared to other alien movies I KNOW THIS ISN'T AN ALIEN MOVIE! but it is from that universe I wouldn't buy it if I was you
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Use this on a daily basis for work.  We have a limited amount of this to work out product and I can set timers for each of my associates...micromanaging at its finest.
B009MO57H6|4.0|How can you not like resident evil? well I understand this movie is probably the weakest out of them but the graphics and idea of resident evil keeps me liking it I will continue to support this series and hope for some more likeable characters in future movies
B000JML7EC|4.0|For a free book it's a great choice. I enjoyed the old English and the plot was entertaining. Jim gets away with a Tom's but he is the hero.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I always liked the x-men ever since the cartoon when I was younger but the movies they came out with really stunk... until this one it predates the other line of x-men movies but it is way better in my opinion
0345803493|5.0|I loved loved loved this entire trilogy!  I think it was extremely brave of this author to present to the mainstream a topic that is so shunned, hidden and COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTOOD!!!!!  Kudos to E.L. James!
B000PMG16U|4.0|movie 1 feels just like the original movies same feel to it and darth maul probably the best villain in this era of star wars is awesome<br /><br />movie 2 it was ok the storys are always good I really think cgi did some damage on the star wars franchise<br /><br />movie 3 My favorite of the 3 obi and anakin dueling lots of fun in buying this collection
B000ICXQU6|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and every time I think it's a fantastic story and Julia Roberts does a great job playing Erin!  I highly recommend!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|this just has to be in your collection its a classic my favorite trilogy and it may never be knocked from that spot
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Easy to play, but hard to get through all the clues to open the elevator. Keeps you thinking. Hopefully the next few levels continue to be as challenging.
B000FIMG68|4.0|I bought this for my girlfriend I would be lost trying to watch season 2 this series is very confusing and i don't really wanna get into it
B002SHD9E2|5.0|It was a breathtaking beautiful performance and made my children fans of the musical genre. I would definitely recommend watching this more then once.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I love star wars always have always will brings me back to when I was younger and these cartoons will do the same for your kids
B0027MJU00|4.0|It was definitely a dark place to read this, but I couldn't put it down.  The ending was a little far-fetched, but that kept me guessing until the last minute.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have been following this series and I do like the story and characters.  I, however, would have liked to have known that this is becoming the never ending story.  I thought this was the last in the series and was disappointed that it is still on going.  I don't know &#34;what happens!&#34;<br /><br />So I woud suggest to Sylvia to &#34;wrap it up already!&#34;.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|If you like a challenge then get this game!  This is really hard but don't give up. It makes you think outdid the box
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and would highly recommend it - can't wait for the next one to come out!
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Simply outstanding! A real gem of a film. The costume and set designs by Cecil Beaton cannot be surpassed. I never tire of watching the film or listening to the Soundtrack.<br />IT DOESN'T GET MORE &#34;LOVERLY&#34; THAN THIS
1400049628|1.0|I purchased this book after reading the positive reviews.  This is really a loser.  It isn't funny, it isn't interesting, it isn't really anything of substance.  I forced myself to read through it because I had spent the money on it but it was really a challenge.  Save your money.
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|This Movie is a good value for the money. You get an excellent transfer of the film with enough added features to warrant buying on DVD. A fan of the film or not, this DVD is definitely worth serious consideration
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Great book.  I was expecting it to be the last of the series so I was really suprised when it ended the way it did.  Can't wait for the next one!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Exelent movie and well directed and acted. i have enjoyed this movie a lot. already watched few times<br />The Avengers: Best Yet! Can't wait for Avengers 2
B0060MYM7O|5.0|this product came on time!  I love this show!  I have fallen in love with the characters as they develop.  the first season left such a cliff hanger I can't wait to watch this movie.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Thank you for my CD I love it great sound this is a awesome and if I need more cds I will purchase from you I recommend o order cds from here.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book that makes me anticipate Rockingham even more. Can't wait to read it too I highly recommend this book
B005K17RU0|5.0|We just started using this app a couple weeks ago.  We have family all over USA. It is<br />Nice to see what weather is like where our family and keep an eye on our ever changing Ohio weather
B002DKGWSE|5.0|GREAT MOVIE VERY INTENSE MOVIE VERY SAD MOVIE TO I HAD SEEN IT BEFORE ITS JUST A GREAT MOVIE TO WATCH
B001AZFO14|4.0|It doesn't happen in hollywood to often, but this movie is amazing given that the main character's dialog is so little. Kurt Russell does more with a facial expression than most actors do with pages and pages of dialog.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I play this Josh Groban CD throughout the day; never tire of it!!!  One of very favorites; what an incredible voice!.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|The ones that gave it a bad review had to be watching a different movie than me. It was a great movie. It pulled me in to the point where I didn't realize I was sitting in my bedroom watching it. Few plot twists and great action. Not sure what else you could ask for. Can't wait for part 2.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|Playrix games are the greatest! Royal envoy is awesome on tablet, excellent graphics and as always great gameplay and storyline. Thank you for making this available for android!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I hate that you only get freakin 15 minutes just to build a stinken house or buliding i rather just play a game for 2 year olds:(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385349947|1.0|Here we go again with the \\"woe is me\\", feminist view that in order to be successful in the work place, you need to become more like a man. If only women could see how powerful they really are just by embracing a woman's feminine skills & using them to their advantage. Aggressive, ruthless, etc, are not what women want to become. Leave these to the men.<br />Another point I wanted to make with this book is that getting to the top in your career means truly sacrificing other more important aspects of your life, such as children, family, etc. There is no such thing as having it all, and more young women are realizing this. The latest studies are showing that even though young women are achieving more higher college degrees than men, they also do not want to sacrifice a rich family & a social life in order to achieve top executive positions. They do not want an all-consuming career that leaves little time for much else. The smarter, younger women saw this with the older feminists and are choosing more balanced, fulfilling lives.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is a match 3 game, but instead of moving individual pieces you slide the entire row, which is a neat twist.  I love the RPG elements.  It's not the most high-tech game on the market, but it's lots of fun.  Some reviews complain that it's tricky to figure out, but for gameplay reminders you can just scroll back to replay the tutorial level.  Or, you can just keep playing it -- it's not that difficult.<br /><br />The graphics and sound are low tech, but I think it's a good thing, it reminds me of old 8 bit console games.  A wonderful bonus is the lack of obnoxious permissions.  It only takes 3 hours to complete the game (now that I've gotten the hang of it), but I still enjoy replays.  Another nice bonus is that battery drain is relatively low.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I am loving this EP so much great sound and great vibe. Excited to see this band grow in the states!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Read it in a day cause I couldn't put it down and the only bad part is I have to wait for the next one to come out. :(
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I have recently read all of Kate Morton's books.  She is a great story teller and I have loved all of her books.
B008393Q2O|5.0|I love this app because I am constantly forgetting something. This gives me a way to jot a note or two.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I can not wait for the next one to come out.  Always a great read
B0090KZDSK|5.0|So loved this book that I couldn't put it done but very up set that now I have to wait til the next one comes out....please hurry up so need to know what happens to the newly weds
0345529057|5.0|Came quickly and at a great price, can't beat it! Just started the tv series so can't wait to get a more detailed story!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I love this game!!! The graphics and music are really cute. The game starts out really easily: You tap the waves to part them and don't let the people drown! It starts to get hard pretty fast as you deal with people who go the wrong way, fall asleep in the middle of the sea, or go really slowly. And don't forget the mummies!<br /><br />For those of you who were offended by the game, please, just relax! It clearly states that it's not trying to mock Christians, and it's not trying to convert those who aren't. I'm a Christian and, like I said, I love the game! The Biblical references are cute and not at all offensive.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to playing more of this game, which won't be a problem, because there are TONS of levels! Two thumbs up to The Pixelizers for creating a fun, innovate, and family-friendly game! It's awesome that this app was the FAOTD, but 99 cents is a bargain for this. :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the graphics are great the scenery is beautiful the noises are realistic the horses reactors if they are real I love this game and you will too
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|YES!  I remember how Queensryche started!!! This Cd reminds me of why I fell in love with this band!  That feeling of awe the first time I heard Operation Mindcrime.  I wont repeat what everyone has said here already.  Let's stop the belly aching about \\"loudness\\" and nitpicking.  If you are a true fan, you will admit this is a great Queensryche album!<br /><br />Of all the crap rock /metal music of today, there is hope for a band that many (including myself) gave up on years ago.  Tate or no Tate, this is the Queensryche that I love!!!<br /><br />5 STARS!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I can't put this book down. Thought provoking...a must read for everyone who wants to continue to grow...You can agree or disagree with the author but you need to be aware of the things that he shares in this book. A MUST for entrepreneur or those who're thinking about choosing that path.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this game is one of the most fun games ever. definatly gt it. I love the samurai he is the best
B00957T6X6|5.0|I typically shy away from extremely popular books, but I need to reconsider that attitude, because I do not regret jumping on the bandwagon at all... The plot line is thick, and leaves no stone unturned. It's amazing to me how Martin is able to jump from story line to story line without missing a beat. It's definitely a hard book to put down...
B007V4QMFK|1.0|I love Avril Lavinge, she is one of my favorite artists. The music isn't the problem (its AMAZING actually). The CD I received is. When i was looking to purchase one, i ordered a &#34;Like new&#34; one, i expected it to be like new, not a broken CD case that doesn't close with the cover falling off. I could have easily over looked it, and did. Then i put the CD into my CD player and i could barely even play because it was so abused. I'm incredibly disappointed.It wasn't an individual seller either, it was shipped from amazon.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Good movie with exception of the occasional use of the F-Bomb. That was unnecessary and diminished the quality of the film.  Overall a good flick.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Couldn't put it down, Mitch is back baby read this in three day/completely got sucked into the book and was totally surprised when I got to the end of the book where did my three days go!
030758660X|5.0|Great imaginative projects from easy to difficult. My absolute favorite was the wolf hat which turned out amazing! You don't have to love vampires to love these knits!
B006AN78XS|5.0|I'm surprised this movie isn't more popular than it is, but maybe I am a biased Woody Allen fan. I recommend this film for anyone with a little wanderlust.
B005KA188S|5.0|If you love Collin, ur in for a treat, soooo hot in this movie! I couldn't find this blue ray anywhere and amazon seemed to have the best price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a blast for kids and all the different places they go I love the game yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy I love this game
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and challenging, and requires one to actually think a little.<br /><br />I can't count how many times I've been stuck for a level for over an hour, and it feels wonderful when you finally get to the next one.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Addictive game.  The fact that there is much more to it than just matching 3 stars keeps me playing again and again.  The only negative thing I can say about it is that the instructions are obviously translated from another language, and not translated well.  But after just a few minutes of playing the rules became clear.  Easily one of the best games on my phone!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The easier levels are just that: easy.  But once you get to the medium, and especially hard levels, there is a lot of logic involved, and it's a great puzzle, to think:  Okay, this has to get to hear, but can't block off these paths.. but then I have to avoid this too!!!<br /><br />I greatly enjoy logic puzzles.  I wasn't too sure of what this was when I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire HD, but it's one of the few that peaked my interest when searching for apps, and I think this is a must have for anyone that likes logic puzzles.<br /><br />The only problem I've personally experienced, and I'm not sure if it's the problem of the app itself or the kindle fire, but I often get a message when first starting saying that an error has occurred, and to please re-download the app.  Sometimes it will say this two or three time, yet after it stops, I play it without any further problems.
B00B1EEKM8|5.0|I have been frustrated for years at the terrible quality of the Jurassic Park DVD since they loaded it with way too many extras, leading to an over-compressed looking film.  The Biu-ray does not disappoint.  It looks and sounds great.  I also appreciate the digital and UltraViolet copies (though beware...the Ultraviolet encode has faulty audio - you can find people mentioning it on forums and supposedly it will be fixed soon).
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I turned this movie on out of boredom and it being new to prime-videos, and was seriously blown away at how well done it was!  I'm not even into Katy Perry's music that much other than her radio play, and I was sobbing like a baby in this movie.  Great flick - really enjoyed it and would easily watch it again.
B003XVYLDU|3.0|this is one of those books that i found irritating because of the recurring phase. even not &#34;reading&#34; it but seeing it so often was irritating. i compare it, because of the irritation factor, to catcher in the rye and bang the drum slowly. they were irritating for different reasons which i actually can't recall. but there it is.<br /><br />aside from that i liked the story.  on the surface it seems kind of cool to time travel, especially the best moments of one's life. thinking about it now, it seems a bit sad. something to do with not being in the present moment.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Lee Child succeeded again to keep me glued to the book. It was a typical Reacher adventure ful of twists and turns.<br /><br />Jerry
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Ordered two chargers, and they were great at beginning with superb charging speed (displayed as AC) on Android phones. In less than a week one turned to USB charging type, soon started to stop charging intermittently. Switching back to older charger which stays charging to make sure the phone/cable are fine. Next day the 2nd charger started to behave same, i.e. slower charging, then stop charging intermittently.<br />Both are on the way back to Amazon as there is no replacement option for 3rd vendor. May try again later... or not.<br />Update 7/8: Received an email immediately from Anker offerring assistant. They believe the charger was defective and sent me two new units right away free of charge. Great customer service and looking forward to testing the new chargers.<br />Update 7/22: I have used both new chargers for two weeks and found some more interesting facts. They work sometime as USB sometime as AC charging. I eventually figured out that during a hot day (here is very hot during summer, 3 digit temperature) if parked car outside for long time period the chargers will act as USB charging. But as soom as the temperature inside the car comes back normal the AC charging mode is delivered. I'm more suprised that the vendor just sent me another follow-up email asking about how the new units have been doing. I'm very happy with this purchase and will definitely buy again from them. I've owned various other Anker products (external battery backup chargers) and never had trouble with any of them. This is the first time I experience issue but their customer service from this vendor is unbelievablly amazing.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Reading this book was not easy. A virgin who is in love with what appears to a compulsive very ricsexual predator who makes her a sex slave. The sexual scenes are well described. This is a raunchy book.<br /><br />Jerry
B0002FQAZM|5.0|this cd is pure rock and roll from days gone by.  the tracks will not disappoint and have stood the test of time.  thank you.
B000I8ERVC|5.0|What a classic had seen it years ago and enjoyed just as much the second time around! A must see

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I started this series of books just so I could help my son with his reading project.  I ended up hooked and had to read all the books.<br /><br />It didn't end the way I thought it would.
B000089RV6|5.0|back in black is a timeless collection of awesome rock and roll.  this is a must have for all rockers.
1781162646|3.0|I was able to read this book in only a few days but more because it was short and written in an easy prose rather than enthralling.  Not up Stephen King's caliber in my opinion.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|this cd is awesome and should be in every rockers collection.  i have darn near wore it out i have played it so much.  get it.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game has a lot of changes so that it is hard to get bored. Very different from candy crush I think even more addicting and It crushes bejewled<br />Rickiervt
B009GFEOY8|4.0|I am still not too sure on the film because my camera messed up most of the photos..looks like the camera messed up the chemicals so only half of the photo would come out..and It was just for testing purposes..I have just ordered another set for a new camera i have found
B003RUZKC8|5.0|We love Jeffrey Dean Morgan from Supernatural.  But in this movie we felt it was an ALL STAR cast!  Everyone did a supurb job and the story line kept going without a stall.  We expect to see this group back together for a second movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very upset with the ending, I guess I Just didn't want it to end! Having to wait for another book is torture! Addicted to mr Cross once again!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very fun it's not difficult but at the same time it's not technically easy but very fun I recommend it for anyone with hands LOVE the game do get :);)&lt;3 &deg;_&deg; #LOVE
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I play it on my kindle to.pass the time and it works great. I would recommend this to others.
B001RHOJSE|5.0|A must read for ordinary people.  It is a brilliant report of how ordinary people in a highly educated and civilized society can be led by their govenment into being a willing participant in a ruthless killing machine.  Reading it is a serious conscious raising experience relevant to our times.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I liked the book.  It kept my interest.  It was like a toned down version of Shades of Grey without the kinky sex.
B00999DFP0|1.0|Seasons 1-5 Bundled: $119.99<br /><br />Seasons 1-5 Individually: $14.96 each<br />  $14.96 x 5 = $74.80<br /><br />BAM!!!! I just saved you $45.19!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely amazing. This is my second time reading the series and I love it. Not just the sexual parts but the book itself is very well written. It's sad, witty, sweet, it's everything I love in a book. I'm anxious for the movie to come out!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Been watching Dex and his foul mouthed sister for 7 seasons. They get great guest stars and name brand directors (like John Dahl) so you know they are doing the genre up right. Unlike other dramas, not really one for binge watching. Savor them, one or two at a time. And watch after dark!
B009X01D9U|5.0|I love this purchase. It fits my Kindle perfectly and looks great. I especially like the band on the inside front cover, so when you flip it back to read, my hand fits in it and helps me hold onto it.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|BEHIND THE CANDELABRA looks at the man behind the myth of Liberace - entertainer, pianist extraordinaire and promiscuous homosexual.  Michael Douglas is just wonderful in the role; he has the voice intonations absolutely right, as well as the body-language.  His Liberace is so in love with his self-created myth that he cannot see beyond it; to say that he is massively self-centered is no understatement. At the same time Douglas portrays him as vulnerable; however much of a star he might have been, he needed young men to lean on as well as to take to bed.  Matt Damon is equally wonderful as Liberace's much younger lover Scott Thorson; at first rather bemused that the celebrity should take such an interest in him, and then falling hopelessly and yet eternally in love.  Steven Soderbergh's film begins quite humorously, with Douglas and Damon indulging in an elaborate courtship; but the tone soon changes as the film examines the lives of the ill-matched yet inseparable couple.  The material is sympathetically yet cleverly handled, producing a compelling piece of work.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|Interesting look into the workings of an interesting man that has created a successful business focused on one thing in a time of massive amounts of choice.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was a great addition to the trilogy.  The ending left you wanting more and also lead me to the conclusion that there is another book coming.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is totally awesome. If you play it once, its like whoa, i never wanna stop! I think it totally rocks because it's really fun, and i love how every once in a while, the place changes. Thats definitely amazing. I would reccomend this to anyone who loves games like this. Better yet, ANYONE
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I really like the fit and look of this case on my kindle. I feel that it is protected and stylish
0061122416|4.0|While I love a great story, I must confess that my chief impetus behind purchasing and reading The Alchemist was a peek inside the \\"Black Box of an International Bestseller.\\" I believe that I found my answer. Coelho captures soul-stirring universal themes in this novella. He infuses his own unique mystic idealism on the age-old, \\"The Secret\\" and his own special interpretations of omens or signs. But that is what good books do. No author can invent noble ideas, but he can pull them into his living room and chat with them and render his own whispering of his time with them. And that is what Coelho does. Other universal human themes such as striving for a dream, the universal language of Coelho's own modern humanism, and the willingness to risk all to make the impossible possible, also helped launch The Alchemist into international bestseller status.<br /><br />That being said, I reserve five stars not just for great stories, but great stories greatly told. Is this novella greatly told? Close, but no cigar. The sweet nectar of the plot is splashed on the reader rather than served in the noble goblets of its noble ideas, resulting in a rushed, undersized novel. Additionally, the ending possesses ostensible inconsistencies and contradictions with some of the core philosophical principles that Coelho instills earlier in the novel.<br /><br />Overall a worthy read, a great story, but not greatly told. Nonetheless, meets the criteria for the great story lover's book shelf.<br /><br />Yours in literature,<br /><br />J.G.C.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A must read if you are reading the series. The beginning wasn't as interesting as#4. In fact, it didn't become a true \\"page turner\\" until I was about 60% through it. What happens towards the end will surprise you and make you wonder.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|I've followed Zimmer closely for almost two decades now, and I'm still amazed at how many times he hits a home run. Man of Steel doesn't have the humability of the Williams theme, but I think Zimmer's is the more powerful score. This is the Man of Steel music of my lifetime and I couldn't think of a better composer to score it.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I loved this book and you will too!  I love the Tv show too and they are both well written.
1781162646|5.0|I listened to the Audible version of this book, and the reader could not have been better for the part.  The book reminded me of the older King books like Green Mile.  A meaningful and wistful tale of coming of age and love and loss.  Don't miss this one.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Do not read this book unless you want to be frustrated. I am so disappointed to get to the end and be left hanging. Not just hanging but the book just stops! This author obviously cares more about money than her readers. At book 3 I was getting a little bored with the story which is drawn out until more than half through when it picks up again then suddenly ends. I read to be entertained not frustrated! I will never buy a Sylvia Day book again.
B0000636NQ|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Ten Years After live on several occasions, all of which were fabulous.  This album is so close to that original experience tha it brings it all back home.  Love it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is incredible-sad in the way that life is, and comforting because we are all connected. I loved it. I will definitely read the authors other books now.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Doctor Who is an institution.  I grew up with it, starting with Jon Pertwee, the Third Doctor, and have made my way through each Doctor's incarnations since.  Nobody plays the part quite like quirky, sexy, brilliant David Tennant.  Nobody.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Such a great series. One of the most exciting and mysterious seasons of all of them! Watch if you want to be mind blown.
B00CKOQC9C|2.0|I found it boring. For science fiction, it had an amazing lack of technology vision. except for rockets to the moon (which were just bigger rockets than they had then) the technology was all of the time when the book was written. One example was that while people had commercial videos stored at home, they were all just film on reels.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I really loved this movie.  I like more intellectual movies so this wasn't really a movie I would pick but something drew me to chose this and I was so pleasantly surprised and entertained.  This movie was so enjoyable and positive.  Positive movies are rare these days and this one really made me feel good.  It was about love and change, faith and hope and how a little love can make a big difference.  It's a keeper--a movie to watch again.  A film with cult-potential.  Nicholas Hoult was really good in this movie too---well acted and impressive.  Highly recommend it! Watch it!
B006CHML4I|5.0|My vision is poor due to an autoimmune<br />Disease. The dial is easier to see than many. Thank you Seiko!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is awesome like the ones that proceed it.  I am currently reading another book.  I hope Sylvia releases the next one this summer.  I have more time to read in the summer.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|A gentle movie again, different, but I did enjoy it.................and there is a theme that if you listen, you will pick up!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I understand that they're trying to drag this out into a longer series...Trilogy means 3! Honestly, I can live with this series being longer, but the way she ended Entwined with You was awful! It just stopped, then there's a note from the author, indicating there will be more books.
B00847KFDS|5.0|Some new songs.  Some from his solo career.  And lots of Credence.  All are performed and produced beautifully.  Lots of duets here too with his diverse friends.  As a result John's singing is better than ever.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|The movie 'After Earth' seems to point that movie-making these days is moving away from a lot of the more introspective themes of the 2000s and becoming more epic and futuristic, a'la  80s and 90s.<br /><br />'After Earth' is a mesmerising epic that follows a journey of a father and son on a spectacular but dangerous foreign planet, Earth.<br /><br />Every great epic adventure would not be complete without some social commentary, but here such social commentary is only hinted at and ends up being redundant. There's a lot of this 'believing in yourself' ethos, which seems recycled from Bagger Vance, which he could of left at the desk of the 5 cent psychiatrist, but you're going to have to live with it, especially since the main enemy is an alien who can't see you, can only smell your fear (!)<br /><br />That said, the main storyline is exciting; you never know what amazing but probably fatal creature will be encountered next, you're always on the edge of your seat, never really knowing what will strike, from where, and a tiny bit of intended horror that doesn't really add to the movie at all.<br /><br />Probably the best thing to take from this movie is seeing how one generation underestimates the next, and the older ones find out those teenagers are a lot smarter than you think. The whole father-son conflict and resolution is really interesting, as is Smith's predictions of just what computers might be capable of in a thousand years. Definitely worth seeing.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|i enjoyed playing this game, I'm glad I finally got the app, been wanting to download this game for a while!!... (:
0307352153|5.0|I could not put this book down! As an introvert, it answered a lot of questions that I had about how to deal with myself and extroverts. Great read!
0786956291|3.0|First let me say it was disappointing to see the lengthy credits for this game do not include Gary Gygax. I can understand not mentioning him if there were no credits, but to have creative credits and leave him out seems quite poor form to me.<br /><br />This set is very inexpensively made. The cards are not actual card stock, instead they are thick paper that has not even been fully punched out. I understand this was probably done to hit a price point, but the general feeling is that this is a disposable set. I can't see the cards lasting very long at all.<br /><br />I can't comment on the game play itself as we are still working on it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book is just a well written sexy book & I can't wait to read the next one. I love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting, very fun, great brain workout and reflex work out. Great fun for children and adults alike. Would recommend for ages 7+.

1609611543|4.0|After ordering Wheat Belly book and the cookbook, the cookbook would have been enough.  This is a long sales-pitch why not to eat wheat.  The cookbook gives receipes which is what I wanted.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the combo of hidden object and escape games. However, I was bummed that it only has 10 rooms.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I enjoy Tom Selleck in this role, similar to Blue Bloods only down-scaled.  He is just an enjoyable, tough guy character.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a REALLY nice room escape game. I tried other ones &amp; got frustrated, plus, this has nice rooms with color! Looking forward to new rooms!
B004S49Z3W|5.0|Loved it. Bridget represents the modern day woman with our faults and good points. All woman can relate to and empathise with Bridget and thus, engage with the story.
0547391005|5.0|Purchased this item for my grandchildren.  The parents tell me the kids absolutely love the book and all that it contains.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This game amazing, addictive, and funny. I just can't put it down, if you want a great game this is it. It's a must!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Good funny episodes within the PG-13 range, it will make anyone over twelve enjoy a genuine laugh. My kid watches the episodes more than once !
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was a very good book!! I read all three books and rooted for Salander. She is a very unconventional heroine. Blomkvist was a tough and sexy hero. The cross examination of Dr Teleborian was genius!! I could not put the book down during that part!! What a great read, all three books!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved this movie.  I loved Iron Man and Thor.  A movie that combines them?  Yes, please! The special effects were amazing, acting ok.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game has many different aspects that keeps your interest. There are hidden objects, mystery and objectives that need to be met. It does allow you to have a narrative to help with guiding you thru how to play. Fun game.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Cute, but where the rest of rooms, only got 10 rooms<br />I like the graphics. Each room takes a minute or two
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you like puzzles you would like this game. It requires you to think about the items you've found and how to use them. Overall a good game.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I wasn't very exicted for this album beacuse of how his last one turne out. sure it was good but wasn't up to speed with Friday night lights or the come up ( cole's last two mixtapes that sounded like albums)  But i was copping yeezus so i thought id give him another chance and im glad i did. The album has a unique place in modern hip hop as a connection between old and new. The outkast sample is too dope! check out the deluxe version for the song is she gon pop. look it up on youtube if you want to know what your missing
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun game. I even win sometimes which is nice. I do not really like all the ads, but I can live with them.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I Love Cirque Du Soleil!  Couldn't wait for their movie to arrive!!!  Fantastic!!! Saw the movie and absolutely had to have it!  I will watch this over and over through the years!  Thank you
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Kept me hooked even though I knew what would happen at the end. Must-watch and a deserving winner of the Oscar for best picture.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A tad easy for an adult or teen but fun anyway. I have played more diffucult puzzles but they were not as enjoyable.good any age game if you arent looking for a challenge
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|A good movie set in England, the intrigues of love in this time period based on the book by Bronte.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|The only thing I think is wrong is when convert the video to mp3 more like an mp4. Now is more friendly
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Hmmmm, I don't know what to say about this book just like I gather Silvia didn't really know what to write. I have grown attached to Eva and Gideon, and that's what makes reading these three books so frustrating. Silvia do you think Eva and Gideon can't handle a stronger story line with real action and crisis? Please I'm begging don't make the 4th book more about ex boyfriends and girlfriends coming between Eva and Gideon, and then leaving Gideon to fix everything. Enough already just take the time to write a good substantial story. You're standing outside the door half placing your foot across the threshold to give us what we want. I want you to evoke emotions from me. I want to laugh, cry, get angry, even excited while reading your books. It took me forever to finish this book because I kept falling asleep. Readers if you have read the first two books then definitely read this one as well.  I only<br />suggest  that because I believe in finishing the whole series I start.  Otherwise I'd say don't start any of these. It's disappointing and they're a tease. They have possibilities of being better, but that's never delivered.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I got so surprise expecting an end....but can't wait for next book. I loved Gideon and Eva's story. It was so hard to put my book down.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Oh my gosh this game is so fun and totaly addictive!!! There is just 1 small problem it doesn't tern very well. But it's so worth it I like to play it right before bed. It clears my mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is truly amazing and is highly recommended for bored teens. It kills time and I have absolutely no problems with it. O MAY ZING!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved it, so intense!!:) I wonder if America will pick Aspen or Maxon? There both great guys but she can only have one of them. She could either be a1(princess) and marry Maxon. Or be a 2 and marry Aspen. It's a very intense love triangle. I suggest this book to girls who love love:) well they have to read the first book though ( The Selection). But an amazing book by Kiera Cass. I usually don't like love stories but this one I did like, I liked it very much:)  So the question is, who will America choose?

How can we get him back before torture makes him reveal everything??!<br /><br />This is a real page-turner.  If you start reading it, be prepared to give up real life for a day or two!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Thank you for putting movies with a message out there. We are encouraged in the Lord every time we watch it! Keep up sharing the good news!
0345529057|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire, starting with Game of Thrones, puts the EPIC in epic fantasy.<br /><br />With unequalled scope, narrative complexity and character variety, interweaving story archs, vast, implied histories, and a gradual unfolding both of plot and the world containing it, Martin's grand series is a worthy contender for best modern fantasy.<br /><br />I could say more but there is no need.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this when I was younger, and have reread it many times.  Definitely my favorite book, the series is quite good as well.
B001OL4TR4|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie!  Now I have it on my Kindle Fire.  I can watch it on my tv or anywhere!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love the diversity of all the beautiful animals, and the animal-catching game is loads of fun for the kiddies!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|My students to play this game.  It needs a lot of strategies and logic to play.  Even my Autistic student loves to play it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game. It keeps you on your toes. It's fun for kids and adults. Love the game. Definitely will recommend this to others
B008GXHOFW|3.0|My son bought this without my approval.  Want to return it.  Takes to much space on the Kindle  I hope I can return.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|interesting applications to current times.<br />After putting it down, I always found it difficult to remember where the book had taken me,
1449325947|4.0|I like the \\"missing manual\\" series of books and often find them very useful. But the learning level if different depending on the author for each topic. The author for this book knows his stuff. He's been webmaster at UC Berkeley and is a writer and teacher/trainer. As a beginner, I found this book a little over my head. I think I need to start with a more basic CSS book before I can \\"graduate\\" to this one. That doesn't mean this book is bad. I think it's probably very good - but I just can't quite judge yet because I need to start at the beginning.  :)
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Best Van Morrison compilation avaiable but would be even better if it as in chronological order!  Has most of his best songs and the sound is great.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love love love this game!  These types of games are my favorite. I can get lost in them for hours. Great traffics, storyline and games!  Decent price for this one too!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This app is amazing, it basically allows you to play magic by yourself (which is impossible to do elsewhere being it requires at least two people). As for the gameplay; flawless, minus an undo button for those silly mistakes made every now and then. I highly recommend this for current magic players and those who are interested to learn- being it supplies tutorials for newbies, and for you veterans, some extra practice.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the best game ever. best carictaer and every thin need to get thisawsome game for kindle fire everything is epic. veryawsome.
1616550414|5.0|The information in here is awesome! Okay, so it's no more than you could find online already, but it's way cool, and pretty nice to have all in one place. The timeline was really nice to get with it! The corners were a little scuffed on delivery, but eh, gives it character.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|A good story which makes you want to get the next in the series as soon as possible.  Gripping and exciting as we're the other two in the series
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Received book immediately. Khaled Hosseini is one of my favourite authors. Waited forever it seems for his next book. Excellent read. I would recommend this book.
B00BTYP6QE|2.0|so my baby cousin was looking 4 apps and then he clicked this app and wanted it. so now it wont install
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I finished this book so quickly I was beyond excited for it! It was just as great at the others but I feel like the author simply gave up at one point and said, &#34;eh that's good I'll just end it&#34;. How long do I have to wait for the next one?! I don't mind the series not being a trilogy because I could read and read forever. Overall it was a good book, I love Gideon and Eva.
B005V4ZEY2|5.0|the very best for security protecci&oacute;n in mobile devices, I recomend to all my friends.... 6 stars in my opini&oacute;n.....
B005FMZWD8|3.0|The fit & finish of this watch is outstanding. For the money (approx 90 USD when I purchased), you are getting a lot. Hold one of these up to other wristwatches in the $100-200 price bracket and the difference in quality is obvious; the Invicta 1513 is in a different class.<br /><br />Out of carelessness, I've already knocked the mineral dial window pretty good against some unyielding metal surfaces, and I've yet to see a scratch. However, I'm certain that with its large diameter and flat surface (i.e. no convexity, like some dial windows), a heavy blow to the center could crack it. But you were going to take off your nice Invicta before tugging at those brake rotors anyways, right?<br />On that topic, note the case diameter is 45mm, and the thickness is 12mm -quite large. This is just fine for me, but some folks might find this disproportionately big for their wrist.<br /><br />The luminous hands and numbers remain incredibly bright after just a little direct sunlight; you won't have an issue telling time in the dark.<br /><br />It's a quartz movement, and mine has not lost more than 30sec in the last month, which is to say it may not have lost any time at all over this period, since I'm not scrutinizing it below a 30sec error.<br /><br />If you're concerned about the odd lug spacing (21mm), don't be. A 22mm nylon or canvas strap will fit just fine. I replaced the stock canvas/leather combo strap as soon as I got this watch - just personal preference.<br /><br />I am giving four stars because mine came with a dead battery. Otherwise, it would be 5. It's possible this model shipped from the factory with a fresh one, then sat in a warehouse for 2 years. We'll never know. Either way, since other reviewers have shared this annoyance, this model might make for an awkward gift-giving experience. I'll further take the opp to say that I don't recommend changing this battery yourself unless you don't mind risking a permanent defeat of the water resistance gaskets, and a void of the warranty. This is just SOP for 100m watches, in my opinion. It shouldn't cost you more than $20 at a jeweler's, including price of the new battery.<br /><br />Update 8-July-2014:<br />The new battery I put in this wristwatch upon receiving it only lasted about 6 months before the movement would randomly freeze. Upon noticing my watch had stopped, I would reset it to the correct time. Repeat ad nauseam. Eventually I replaced the battery again. This resetting of the movement became increasingly necessary until May of this year (2014) when the movement would stop within 1-2min of resetting and it was clear the battery was not the issue. I took the watch to a local repair shop and the repair person concluded the original quartz movement had failed. He ordered and installed a new one for me. Cost of part was approx $60 USD. Watch has now worked great for a month with no loss of time.<br /><br />I should add that this wristwatch had never been touched by water, let alone submerged, so I reason that the quartz movement was faulty at time of shipment/purchase.<br /><br />As a result, I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars. I still like the watch, but I don't recommend purchasing it online unless you have a clock/watch repair shop nearby. Because it's possible other 1513s will ship with this same issue and, to my knowledge, the only alternative is sending this watch overseas for repair at Invicta.<br />I did not attempt to contact the seller for a refund/return.
B000HA4WTI|5.0|While not my favorite of the series (in fact, because of one scene in particular it's my least favorite) it's still a wonderful movie. Great acting, awesome sequences, and definitely fits well with the series.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|It has to be said that Bruno wasn't as funny as Borat by a huge margin, however 'The Dictator' comes much closer. It has those absolutely side splitting moments as well as the serious ones. Cohen definitely does his thing, in a movie that is much less of a mockumentary but definitely a winner.

0446554995|5.0|This is a fine ending to the long story of Pendergast's relationship with Helen. Of course it leaves us with further mysteries to solve as he is a character with more layers than a Vidalia onion. Fascinating and fun. It is amazing how these two writers are able to write about so many exotic places and so many outrageous ideas that they make clear--at least temporarily--try to explain them later!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it....I'm addicted. I played for 3 hours the first time I played. It is a great time killer. If you like to think and like puddles, this is a game for you. every level is a challange. Although at times it can get quite confusing.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|Format: Blu Ray<br /><br />Pros:<br />Got the three disc edition for under $8<br />Came with a free comic<br />Abbie Cornish, Emily Browning, Jenna Malone, Jamie Chung, Carla Gugino are all great actresses<br />The music selection is very good<br /><br />Cons:<br />Empty story<br />Overly dark<br />Poor use of high caliber stars<br />Very Grainy Blu Ray transfer<br />5.1 sound is awful and constantly having to raise and lower volume<br /><br />With a cast like this, I was hoping for a better movie. I really enjoy Zack Snyder's work. I loved Watchmen and Man of Steel looks promising (going to see it in a few days). This film though...something was definitely missing. The opening felt contrived and forced. It was overly dark and it made me feel like Zack knew he was skimping on the opening so he tried like hell to make the film dark to get the despair of the characters across. It didn't work at all and in the end, I didn't really care about what happened to them. While the visuals are nice at times, I felt like I was being bombarded with constant visual assault. I understand Zach has a certain style that he goes for, but it felt as if he just kept layering it on over and over to the point where I stopped watching the film at several times (I actually watched the extended version of the film over a 5 day span, constantly stopping it out of boredom and annoyance). As previously mentioned, the sound isn't all that great. I absolutely hate it when the dialog in films is kept at an unnecessarily low level. While characters were speaking in this film, I was constantly having to raise the volume so I could hear them. Then as soon as an action scene kicked in I had to lower it or be overpowered by gunfire and blasting music.<br /><br />Regardless of the sound issue, Zach did pick some good music for the film. I instantly recognized Bjork's Army of Me which I've owned on CD for several years (was on the soundtrack for the film Tank Girl). It was nice to see Carla Gugino in another one of his films. I liked her performance as Silk Spectre. She did a good job here as well. The rest of the previously named actresses could probably carry their own films without a problem. Unfortunately, I felt their talents were underutilized in this movie. Abbie Cornish in particular had a great performance in the film Bright Star. I knew this being an action film we wouldn't see the same performance from her, but I felt bad knowing that with all her talent she was held in place by a hollow and boring character.<br /><br />I'm also a little happy for them as they were able to let go of their more serious roles and just cut loose and kick some butt in this movie. It was nice to see them all having a good time with the sword and gun play. I think the overbearing visual effects hurt their good time though as they are constantly tugging at your eyes when you should be paying attention to the characters.<br /><br />Overall, this film for me was a snoozer. I just got bored with it so many times that I almost didn't finish it. I'd seen it in stores for a few weeks, but never picked it up as I'd read some bad reviews. When I saw that it was under $8, I thought what the hell. I'll give it a look. I can see why there were so many bad reviews though. I won't say the film is trash because it does provide a little fun if you have a couple of hours to spare. If you like a movie with some depth and a solid story though, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />2.5 / 5ther one of his films. I liked her performance as Silk Spectre.

B0045HCJRG|5.0|Branden Fraser & Alicia Silverstone knock this proverbial ball OUT OF THE PARK for a successful home run!!  I don't remember how many times I have seen this movie, yet it's all new & fresh every time.  It is one successful comedy that bring a laugh in every scene; EVEN when there are scenes with tension & drama, it is artfully combined with a comedic undertone or end of scene.  If laughter is the best medicine, then \\"Blast from the Past\\" is chocked full of healing!  Furthermore, there are NO insignificant or unnecessary roles/actors.  Each one brings something to the table.  I really admire what Dave Foley as Troy (Eve's gay roommate), and Harrison Young (the drunken bum, shacked up in the storefront, which is now over part of the bunker that Adam & his parents have lived in for 35 years & its elevator from which Adam, his mother & his father eventually appear & disappear, causing the bum to mend his ways [thinking he is having a profound religious experience] and makes the storefront a church.)  Both their parts offer irreplaceable dual tender and comedic moments. In my humble but extensive movie-watching opinion this movie is perfect (unlike many others I have seen), because there is neither anything that should have been added, nor is there anything that was redundant or should have been left out.  It's perfect!  Hurray to the Leading - Man Branden Fraser & Leading Lady - Alicia Sliverstone (BTW I LOVED her hair!) as well as the entire cast, crew, writers, etc. Five stars, and two thumbs up.

B0051OZ564|1.0|I rent cause I was think the movie was good but not, I think this is the worse movie I ever saw in my life
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book was captivating. ((I read through it in less than 24 hours. Partly because it was a smooth read, partly(okay, mostly) because I was intrigued by both story lines.)) also, i had last evening off, as well as this morning.<br />(Spoilers)<br /><br />PROSKIS!!:<br />The language of flowers, (I mean the language of flowers within the book, not the actual book) is so romantic and intriguing and a completely new concept to me. I hope I can continue the fascination this book presented me.<br /><br />The author has created characters you can relate to. Even if the recognition is is small. Small reactions, or instinctual ones ring true.<br /><br />Also, my attention kept coming back to this book. While I should have been sleeping, I wanted to know what Victoria would do next. While I was showering, I was frustrated I couldn't bring my kindle with me. You get the point. I wanted to knoooow, I couldn't wait to knooooooow what would happen to our emotionally troubled gal.<br />(Edit! A rose, is a rose, is a rose)<br /><br />CONSKIS!!:<br /><br />I have an active imagination, and perhaps the moments of physical character description came a little at a time, or maybe right when we met them, but I do not know what Victoria looks like. (Excuse that lengthy sentence.) As not only our narrator, but also our protagonist, I want to know who I'm rooting for. Or not rooting for. I want to know what Victoria looks like, I need to know more about Elizabeth's appearance. Aside from frail framed and dirty short hair with leaves in it, I couldn't pick Victoria out of a line up.<br /><br />The ending was rushed, predictable and clumsy. I am happy to have Victoria back where she unknowingly belonged the whole time, but the way she returned seemed rushed. Elizabeth and Grant, and even baby Hazel, loved her since she loved them,  and I can get behind the idea of letting her in so easily. But our girl, Victoria, proved herself to be just as disappointing to everyone involved, as she had always been. Hooray she confessed. Hooray she showed up. But, she deeply hurt everyone, and i mean everyone she has come in contact with, even in her adult life. What happened to earl? And renata? And even Bethany? She abandoned all of them.<br /><br />In conclusion, I guess our main character is a rose is a rose is a rose.<br /><br />^^^^^<br />Also, I just now got the book. Don't listen to a word I said. This book is effing awesome.

1609611543|5.0|Wonderful book.  It was written at a level most could understand.  Although there were some medical and biochem terms I could have looked up for more detail, but I felt like we could understand the message without going to all that trouble.  The graphs and charts based on data collected over the past 100 years made perfect sense as did the conclusions drawn.<br /><br />People recommended that I read (Why We Get Fat?) but this one came first and I couldn't put it down.  Wow!<br /><br />It makes perfect sense.<br /><br />After reading this book, I realize that in order to be healthy I need to give up the junk food and sugar that I eat in excess even though it is gluten-free.  It's not about losing weight; it's about being healthy so I can enjoy my middle and old age instead of having to deal with avoidable illnesses and excessive medications and their side effects in my later years.<br /><br />I wish all M.D.'s, parents and everyone else would read this book and make their own decisions on what to eat.  I think it would help everyone be healthier if they would avoid wheat and eat real food and healthy fats and oils instead of diet, low-fat, processed and junk food.<br /><br />So many of the people I care about, my family, friends and students or their families are ill and/or tired all the time.  I think if they read this book, it could help them overcome their digestive issues, acid reflux, skin conditions, their joint inflammation and joint pain, their diabetes, heart disease, asthma, ADHD, memory loss, etc.  Then they could lead a more active and healthy life w/o having to take so many pills.

B00BAVCD8A|4.0|Fall Out Boy - Save Rock And Roll<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />After announcing an indefinite hiatus in 2009, Illinois rockers Fall Out Boy make a triumphant return in 2013 with the release of their new album Save Rock And Roll.<br /><br />Over the past few years the band members have been exploring side projects they felt they could not do while Fall Out Boy was active. Singer and guitarist Patrick Stump released a solo album, Soul Punk in 2011, drummer Andy Hurley and guitarist Joe Trohman formed the metal group The Damned Things with Scott Ian of Anthrax fame, while Bassist and chief songwriter Pete Wentz teamed with singer Bebe Rexha to form the ska/electro pop band The Black Cards.<br /><br />With all of that out of their systems, the lads returned to Fall Out Boy with a sense of revitalisation and freshness. Save Rock and Roll has all the hallmarks that make Fall Out Boy a multiple MTV Video Music Award winner.<br /><br />The opening track The Phoenix is a big bold smack in the mouth, which signals the bands intentions, followed by the first single My Songs Know What Did In The Dark (Light 'em Up) which keeps the foot on the throat. Alone Together, Where Did The Party Go? and Death Valley showcase the band's ability to write a seriously catchy tune that won't escape your head and gets the toes tapping - this record will make you want to get up and move. A number of guest performers appear throughout the album, which includes American rapper Big Sean, Courtney Love, Foxes and Sir Elton John on the title track Save Rock And Roll.<br /><br />The album was produced by Butch Walker who has produced albums for the likes of Avril Lavgine, Simple Plan, Sevendust, Default and Taylor Swift among others. This is his second time producing for the band, having previously worked on their commercial success Infinity On High release, and the results are stunning. The sound is ambitious, polished and big...very, very big.<br /><br />Save Rock And Roll blurs the line between pop, rock, mainstream and punk but is one hell of a ride, one you'll want to take again and again.between pop, rock, mainstream and punk but is one hell of a ride, one you'll want to take again and again.

B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Tom Keifer - The Way Life Goes<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />Hair Metal. I just don't like the term. To the best of my knowledge, the phrase came to life at the beginning of the new millennium and is used to describe bands mostly from the club circuit in Los Angeles during the 1980s. Motley Crue, Poison, Ratt, Dokken and Warrant are examples of what people mean when they say \\"hair metal\\". I find it offensive because the term implies that any of these bands only became popular based on their image, their pretty boy looks or their monster hair styles, and that they had no musical substance or even spent any amount of time perfecting their craft, but that just isn't the case.<br /><br />Take Cinderella as a case in point. I know what you are thinking, another glitzy, glam, decadent example of 80s metal from the L.A. scene. Well firstly they weren't from L.A. - they were from Philadelphia, and secondly they were an outstanding hard rock outfit that took the time to mould some amazing songs and albums that went past the efforts of some of their counterparts.<br /><br />Sadly it has been a while since the band has laid down any new material, this is due in part to issues in the band and legal entanglements with their record company, however this hasn't stopped lead singer Tom Keifer from forging ahead and releasing his debut solo album titled The Way Life Goes.<br /><br />The Way Life Goes has been nine years in the making and was recorded independently of any record company involvement giving Keifer the freedom to create a solid rock performance. From the first few chords of Solid Ground, the album's opening track, with its bluesy rock flavour you get the feeling you are about to experience a very impressive piece of work.<br /><br />The album kicks into a higher gear with It's Not Enough, Mood Elevator, Welcome To My Mind, and Babylon. The album also contains a number of acoustic driven tracks throughout such as A Different Light, Thick And Thin, Ask Me Yesterday and The Flower Song. It has to be said that there are any number of songs that could have appeared on a Cinderella album and at times I had to remind myself this was a Tom Keifer solo project.<br /><br />In a lot of reviews you will read so and so is sounding better than ever, in this case that is actually true given Keifer lost his voice at the end of the Cinderella tour for Heartbreak Station in 1991. Since then he has re-injured his left vocal cord on a number of occasions and had to re-train his voice. It is fair to say his range, tone and technique is of a better quality.<br /><br />Once you strip away all the glitzy packaging from these 80s rockers you are left with no choice but to appreciate their musical abilities. Tom Keifer proves that on this record. After one listen you will see that Tom Keifer - The Way Life Goes is anything but hair metal.<br /><br />TOM KEIFER INTERVIEW ONLINE NOW AT FULL THROTTLE ROCK!day and The Flower Song.

030758836X|5.0|Don't want to give away any spoilers, so all I will say is read this book NOW!  This is an edge of your seat twister that really satisfies. I've already cast the whole thing in my head: How about Gwyneth Paltrow and Bradley Cooper??
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|Bon Jovi - What About Now<br />Written by The Rock Man<br /><br />From the get go let me declare my bias towards this band. I have been a strong advocate for this New Jersey rock outfit since 1984, long before they were household names selling out stadiums the world over. Back then they were like any other long haired, glitzy hard rock band trying to leave their mark on the world. In 1986 they did leave their mark, with their Slippery When Wet release and from there they have become one of the great rock acts in music history.<br /><br />By the time These Days was released in 1995, Bon Jovi had five outstanding albums under their belt, but These Days was the first time my faith in the band was tested, and sadly it wouldn't be my last - Crush (2000), Lost Highway (2007) - what were they thinking? Of course in between these shaky moments the band would redeem themselves with some solid efforts, however the band I grew up loving in the 80s has changed over the years.<br /><br />This brings us to 2013 and another chapter of the Bon Jovi story with the release of What About Now. This new album offers, for the most part, an enjoyable listen. Bon Jovi have become synonymous with big catchy arena rock anthems and that is what they serve up on this album with Because We Can, That's What The Water Made Me, Beautiful World and the title track, What About Now. What's Left Of Me has a strong Someday I'll Be Saturday Night feel to it and overall What About Now is a well made record. The slight problem I have is that from time to time I forget I am listening to Bon Jovi and I think I'm trapped in an asylum listening to Tom Waites. Tracks such as Amen, The Fighter and Not Running Anymore (a bonus track on some versions) couldn't be any further from the band of the 1980s.<br /><br />I don't understand why bands have to change or even tinker with a tried and true formula that has worked so well for them in the past. The perfect example of this is the artists that felt the need to compete with the grunge movement of the 90s by releasing their own \\"grunge style\\" album. Or in Bon Jovi's case, their 2007 need to channel Keith Urban on Lost Highway.<br /><br />Regardless, What About Now on the whole stacks up well with other releases from the band over the last decade or so. As always the song writing is very positive and offers hope in these uncertain times and the musicianship is top notch, especially guitarist Richie Sambora and lead singer Jon Bon Jovi who deliver strong performances throughout.<br /><br />There's enough on What About Now to keep casual fans more than entertained and as far as us die hards like myself are concerned, we'll continue to \\"Keep the Faith\\" and follow the boys from Jersey no matter what they do.pete with the grunge movement of the 90s by releasing their own \\"grunge style\\" album.

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Huge fan of the original Terminator.....but was more than a bit concerned about how good a transfer would be to BD/HD.  Turns out I didn't need to worry at all.  The transfer is spotless....saturated colors, HD level, and the sound is awesome.  If you're a terminator fan, definitely the BD version should be in your library.
0141192488|4.0|I love the story and the little extras contained in this book, but I don't like the color of the book or the pictures on the cover.  I just don't care for the pictures of the dragons or whatever they are supposed to be.  I would have liked a blue cover better with a different design.
B005LAIGWS|3.0|I was traveling when this movie came out, and never had a chance to see it in a theatre.  So when the BD came out, pulled the trigger.  Still debating on how wise that was.<br /><br />HUGE fan of the original Ghost Rider - that Nicholas Cage, laughing aside, was a pretty good character for this, and the story was well told.  This one, maybe not so much.  Obviously Fonda wasn't involved, but there really should have been a bit of a discussion on why a TOTALLY different dude was playing the role?  Also, the story was...shall we say, kinda weak.<br /><br />That said, the HD is solid, the saturation is perfect, and the sound is awesome.  So if you're a major Ghost Rider fan, grab it.  If not, Red Box is likely a pretty good option.

However the driver seems well supported, the mac install package went smoothly and my device worked quickly after reboot.  I'm sure that this adapter would work well for many other devices, but I can only speak for my personal experience which has been good.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I liked it works well no complaints.  It was free which was a great price, would recommend it does what it says.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|One of my all time favorites of all the super hero movies out there. I watch it over and over!
B002SRQ214|5.0|made a big difference after I installed the Quad core.  Playing BF3 game was crashing and frame rates were really bad. I had a bottle neck at my CPU I had a great video card but it was heald back by the CPU- quad core made a huge improvement in my system
B002VECM72|2.0|Even the new one you sent me still does play in the machine.  All the rest of the movies you have sent play good and i have no problems with them but for some reason this one just will not play in my machine.  So i have not watched it yet.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Had to watch this movie for a graduate school project on mental disorders in popular media, very good movie. Portman, Kunis and the other actors and actresses did a very good representation of the intense pressure in the enclosed world of the arts and ballet specifically, and how easily things can turn worse.
B00821OX98|2.0|Good show not enough action. I wish it were more like x-files. It is ok to watch i guess. I like it.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I love the writing style of the author, and the message.<br /><br />I agree 100% with all of the methods and ideologies he talks about in this book. It is interesting to take a little peak into the life of convict, while learning more about body weight training.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I loved this book- a great read & have shared it with my teenaged daughters who also loved it also. Beautifully written with great insight into the teenage mind as well as death & illness. Heart-warming & highly recommended!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Son played for a few months, got pretty far and now it will NOT play and NO ONE will help!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love this game....the background music is so calming too! The puzzles are challenging but still fun and progress as you learn.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I bought three kindles. I bought two for my kids one for my niece. All three of them we only one year and six months old. They no longer can be charged.I tried to use a new charger no luck. I called kindle they told me there is nothing they can do to help me. I'm looking into a law suit. I want my money back or all three of them fixed or replaced.
B00003CXCT|1.0|FAIL.....give us the originals. I grew up watching the ORIGINAL versions on VHS. So many fans want the original cuts....why not give it to them?<br /><br />Thankfully Lucas was greedy and sold the rights to Disney.
B00821OX98|4.0|I really enjoy watching this show. Special effects are great for TV and the storyline is interesting! I was very excited to see they came back for a third season
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|it was a pretty good movie but its just like dear john and the note book put together.  like a scary movie but not really lol but it was pretty good.
B00005RDRO|4.0|This is a fun movie. If you enjoy Neil Simon movies you will enjoy this movie.  No major whodunit but still some questions. There are funny twists and turns. I enjoyed going back to a funny time in movies.
B001KZG99A|4.0|love that movie. its was really good i like the 2 and 3 as well.  but the first is really great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I just finished accidentally deleting the app by mistake while removing from favorites but get the app I give it five stars it's worth the seven bucks so get the app it is the best app ever created.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game keeps me coming back for more! I have tried other dragon games-none compare to this one! I totally recommend this game to anyone that enjoys great graphics-dragons-dragon combat- very glad I found this game!! Thank you!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It is one of my all time favorites. If you look deeper than the surface you will find a guy who has lost his way and so in love with a girl, that is trying to find hers, that he will do anything and be anything just to make her happy. He knows he is not good enough for her but can't seem to leave her. The relationship between Travis and Pidge is explosive but I couldn't tear myself away. It is a must READ!!!!!
B005544V6A|5.0|I wanted to catch up on the first two seasons of suits before the third season started and now I have and can't wait for the new season to begin.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can you escape is an awesome game!! The game is hard but not to hard but is challenging!! Waiting for more levels please!!!!
B001AQMBKA|5.0|Excellent story and others, you should see it or if you've already seen, a great collection for you, buy now!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game. It is really fun and addictive. I'm really happy that I downloaded this game. I really love horses and this game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of the top three games in Champaign Illinois I will NEVER stop playing it in my life
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|With a wedding to kick off the season and other surprises sure to be revealed, Downton Abbey is set to become your all-time favorite show. A lot of us do not have the time to sit down and watch the show every week during its regular season; therefore, we need to watch the episodes online.<br /><br />Amazon has the corner on this market. You cannot see Downton Abbey on Netflix or Hulu Plus. It is a shame that Amazon feels it has to charge the Amazon Prime customers to view these episodes. They should be part of the Amazon Prime package. That would be the right thing to do and would attract even more future Amazon Prime customers.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|can't stop listening to this album and neither can my spouse... would recommend to anyone.  they recently showcased on ROTR
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Amazing and very entertraining movie, great actors. Glad things have change thru the years, can't imagine living in fear for your life every day. Overall very informative 1917 era.
1476734941|4.0|I expecting more recipes! I liked the information about how fast diet works, but I need different and easy recipes to prepare daily.
B00APJLY0Q|3.0|A cute family movie, however my Kindle will not let me watch it for some reason.  Otherwise a good movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love how they are growing closer together and so much more trusting of each other.  I love all the loose ends because I know there is so much more to come in the next book! Can't wait! I love Gideon just as much as I loved Christrian Grey!  As much as the books are similiar, they are also very unique, with a very different style.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its a fun game but doesn't compare to the first one, which I like much better.  The first one has better graphics and is more fun.
0439023491|5.0|I typically don't like to read books if they're part of a movie series -- until after I see the movie. But my wife has already finished reading it and it's killing her not to talk to me about it. So I'm reading at a slow pace, trying to wait for the movie, but fast enough that I can talk to her about what I already read. Personally, after seeing the first movie, and seeing Jennifer Lawrence all made up on the red carpet and in magazines, I'll be watching the movies and finish reading the series just to see her.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|This ap was unsatisfying as it does not allow for putting pictures into it. You could n't put pictures onto the notebook pages themselves.
0439023513|5.0|I haven't read this book yet, simply because I prefer to see the movie first and then read the series. My wife loved it, though, and it was part of her Mother's Day presents.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|The best game I have gotten.  It was super fun and amazing.  I love the graphics way better than the first edition.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My Bible it' always there for me in good and in bad days. It teaches me more than any university on earth could.<br />It answers all my questions, and makes me a better person. You don't have to take my word for it, just get yourself one and read it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent book.  I so enjoyed watching and listening to Mr. Hosseini when Andrea Mitchell was interviewing him.  I'm glad I read the book before seeing his interview
B001GUXJQA|4.0|This was my second book of the Harry Bosch novels I read. These books are hard to put down. They keep you guessing and on your toes. Can't wait to keep going through the series.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was so looking forward to this book and very, very, very, very disappointed that it is being continued.  I'm looking forward to the next episode but please makes this the last and don't make your readers wait 'months'.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Unbelievable! How named as trilogy if you finish the third  book without an end?<br />Sylvia Day have stoped the history without no sence!<br />I am not going to read the others..... If we are talking about making money, try other way!
B009XY97VC|5.0|I like it better than invincible and archangel, it's a close tie with archangel actually. Swooping melodies, epic crescendos, each track is packed with personality, and flavor. You get some fast, some slow, some dreamy, some heavy... Not sure what I think about the After Earth song... I think the vocals could have been better.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it! If you liked fifty shades of grey you will love this book. I'm going to get the next book now.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Purchased the 80 chip pack. Was charged but did not receive. Buyer beware. There seems to be no way to contact the game for them to correct.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I thought it was really good. Thanks I liked it a lot .I thought they had a great chemistry together.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Strong female lead<br />Action packed<br />Characters fleshed out really well<br />Gets you emotionally involved<br />Wonderful love story<br />More detail/plot than in the movie
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I have been using this app for a day and it gets the job done. I'm glad I bought it.
1781162646|5.0|I read this book over a two day car ride.  It's a coming of age story that is inreresting & funny & if one has ever had their heart broken you will be able ro relate to the main character's struggle. Totally recommend this book. Stephen King once again delivered a great story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So easy to connect and catch up! I love it, social networking is the new way of life. I'm not a teenager but it is the best way to communicate in this new age of  internet and computer advancement.
B001AXKXBW|5.0|I put this up with Pink Floyd's &#34;The Wall&#34; and Queensryches &#34;Operation Mindcrime&#34;!  Great concept album, a Dream Theater must have!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play lots of bingo on my Kindle and this is my favorite!!  The bingos are plentiful.  My only complaint is that near the end of available bingos it counts down so fast that it is hard to call a Hinton before the round ends.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|I love pixar films!!! Especially when there not at regular price!!! Package was small and not in a huge box for 2 items that i purchased.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best and you should definitely get it.it's really fun and exciting.this game is really worth getting
B0036S4CTS|1.0|I received this book for free from a friend whos work gave it to him before the movie came out. I love reading and it was free and it had that great sticker on it saying New York Times best seller so I was happy. Right off the back I wasnt a fan. I love to read so I kept reading hoping that the author would pull something and keep me engaged. The plot was terrible, some jerk who thinks hes too good for anyone and the school girl who yerns for him. Every \\"year\\" in the book was the same, he was still a jerk and she was still the school girl. Then when he finally comes to reality the stupid twist comes. I was so angry to read the book at that point I was beyond words. I still had hope though... When the movie came out I made someone take me...I wasnt going to waste my own money and see the movie adaptation. Hoping that Anne Hathaway could bring something to the book but no, still terrible. Dont waist your time, I have no idea how this ended up on best sellers, I am assuming the authors book before this was better and his followers read it being hopeful. Afterall just because it was a \\"best seller\\" doesnt mean the people that read it liked it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was a great informative book too read. What else can I say? This is a great!book<br />I love reading it.
1932100660|5.0|This book will change your life! Read it to help you rethink how you look at food and live a healthier life. It is worth the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This Is a really good game for kids and it helps entertain kids. I love it myself it keeps me busy as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't stop playing. Awesome concept. Good graphics. Download it to see for yourself. Challenging but fun. My cat watches me play it all the time. That's all for now. Have a good day everyone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this escape. Better then floors. Has puzzles, key, movable items, and some surprising codes. Can wait for more levels.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I downloading my music to the alarm clock so now I can hear beautiful music from my favorite band maroon 5 when I wake up!!!!!!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is not that bad. I thought it would be horrible but it's not. I love to play this now I can't stop. You should really get this game and  it's free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow! Subway Surfers from Amazon has great graphics and doesn't have any glitches. It is so much fun and addicting. Download it and see for yourself. You will not be disappointed, believe me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read this book probably 12 times and I thoroughly enjoy it each time I read it.  It always feels fresh, new and unique each time.  This is by far Orson Scott Card's best book.  The characters are three dimensional and Ender just feels &#34;real&#34;, almost like OSC wrote a documentary rather than a novel.  I can see why this book has been studied by military officers over the years.  I wish the Shadow series could re-capture the magic of this book but alas, I never could get into it.  This and Speaker for the Dead are by far his best fiction simply because the world he has created feels &#34;real&#34; with characters who think and do things that only real people would do.  Can't recommend this book enough.
B009EFP278|5.0|Excellent dance music.  Great new songs.  He is a very good entertainer.  Saw him guest on a few chat shows and had to get the cd.  Great summer music
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Although I love these books,#5 is not my favorite -- not enough Ayra & other favorites for me and too many new characters I don't care about.  Also too much fighting detail and not enough dyrewolves! Finally, when will Dany reach the west and have meaningful interactions with hwe
B0056JJXOO|3.0|This is an old film with some nudity of the Juliet and Romeo young characters.  Since it is an accurate recreation of the original Shakespeare we watched it with our 13 year old prior to his reading of the original play.  Not a very moving story as depicted in this film and, of course, nearly everyone already knows the ending.  You won't be enthralled, but it is a classic that is useful as a supplement to the study of Shakespeare.  Just be aware of the brief partial nudity in the last half if your using it with pre-adults.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a most enjoyable Solitaire app.  The graphics are terrific, and very sharp. If you like playing Solitaire, this is the one for you!  It won't disappoint.  I highly recommend it.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I love sci-fi and brain twisters.  This movie doesn't make sense on so many levels.  Not worth even spending time critiquing it.  If you never see this movie you will never miss it.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|If you enjoy Andrea Bocelli's voice, there's plenty to love about this DVD.  My only &#34;complaint&#34; would be that it should have been about a half-hour longer; the concert sped by very quickly!  Time flies when you're having fun.  All of the guest stars' voices blended nicely with Andrea's, and I enjoyed the variety of songs - from &#34;Ave Maria&#34; to &#34;Santa Claus is coming to town.&#34;  The DVD is of good quality; even on my ancient 1997 TV the picture and sound are quite satisfying.<br /><br />Bocelli's voice ranges from operatic (&#34;Adeste Fidelis&#34; and &#34;Angels we have Heard on High&#34;, for example) to lyrically beautiful (&#34;Silent Night&#34; or &#34;White Christmas&#34;) to softly enchanting (&#34;Caro Gesu Bambino&#34;).  I especially enjoyed the original French version of O Holy Night, which is titled &#34;Minuit Chretiens&#34;.  Also, the duet &#34;What Child is This&#34; with Mary J. Blige is especially memorable.<br /><br />Even for folks who might not be Bocelli fans, this is nice, old-fashioned Christmas family fare with a good selection of singers for the duets - Mary J. Blige, Reba McIntyre, Natalie Cole, Katherine Jenkins....and even the Muppets manage to sing Jingle Bells with gusto!  In addition, the adult choir, the children singing on &#34;Santa Claus&#34;  and the Salvation Army boys' choir do a beautiful job, as does the orchestra.  What's not to like?
B000TEUSJK|1.0|It wandered and sucked,every minute of it! Don't buy this as it is a rambling waste of time! Keep your money!!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I just love this game because it is a new version of cut the rope, one of my favorite games.  I like the portals that come up when you beat a section of levels.  I like the new things that they put on there (chains, blades that cut the chains) because  they don't have them on regular Cut the Rope.  You will love this game.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|High price, well built, many extras (filters, stand and case)<br />Many features, works well on my D300s,D5100,D7100.<br />Yes, I would recommend it to others.
1419702238|5.0|I must admit that the literature is not the best for my six year old, however he has been taking this book with him in the car! I have never seen this before.. he actually loves to read it aloud and I find him reading the book on his own! I promote that!<br />Towards the end of the book, we started reading the book together and it was actually entertaining.  I would like to read it from the beginning! Ha.<br />Thank you!!
B005LAII80|5.0|One of the most underrated movies of 2012. Dredd sadly fell short here in the states due to poor advertising and the attachment of the 3D tag in the name. Those of us who did see it though have fallen in love with it. It was the best movie of 2012 and will go down as one of the greatest cult films of our generation. Here's hoping pages like 'Make a Dredd Sequel' lead to a much deserved sequel. This movie kicked so much butt and deserves better. Instant classic in the same vein as Robocop, Escape from NY etc.<br /><br />[...]
1401937519|5.0|I love this book.  I purchased it as a gift for a very special friend.  There is lots of wisdom in this book.  It's written in a concise and easy fashion.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|The free version had lots of activities and lasted a long time. I didn't hesitate to purchase the full version because the game had just the kind of activities  I enjoy. There different scenes to visit and find useful objects. There were various actions which you have to figure out. in some of the hidden object scenes you have to come some objects. Love I want more like this.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I have read all three books. I found this book interesting however, some parts seemed to be a repeat of details in &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;. The introduction and concluding parts of the book were those I enjoyed most, although I didn't feel that in the end connecting all the people was done clearly.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I loved hearing all the music.  I love all his music and lyrics.  It was an experience to listen to his friends, family and the Wailers talk about him and share their experiences. I highly recommend this DVD.
B008XGW1CI|5.0|Originally posted on The Canon!<br /><br />I have to admit, I didn't think she could top Harry Potter. I mean, let's be honest - Harry Potter made me fall in love with reading. I hoped for an owl to drop a letter from Hogwarts on my doorstep on my 11th birthday. How on earth could she top that?<br /><br />Oh my lanta.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy begins with Barry Fairbrother's death, leading the whole town slowly into a state of pure and utter chaos. Barry seemed to be the man who held the shaky glue of the parish together, but with him gone, the entire house of cards simply collapses.<br /><br />I will admit, I found the synopsis a little dry, but the book itself had such beautiful language, it made my little English major heart go pitter-pat. And the intricacy of the plot: everyone was connected to everyone, in some way, shape or form. Everyone has a secret. I don't want to go into character motives or plot too much (I really want you guys to read this!), but I will say I was astounded at the depths of the characters (although I shouldn't have been - look at Harry Potter). I loved how she incorporated different aspects of the British culture (varying accents, for example) as well as the prejudices and pride that each character carries around in their heart.<br /><br />This book astounded me, and while it took me a few chapters to sink in, I wasn't able to put it down after 50 pages. The characters are so vibrant, so intricate, that I forgot I was sitting in the break room at work - instead I was transported into the chaotic, drama-filled world of Pagford, following each character's story and constantly viewing the others from different sides. I'm in love.<br /><br />Side Note: Don't let the cover fool you. Truly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Try to make sure you don't get caught! In this game you have to collect as many coins as possible as you can, stay away from the guard, and try to beat your highest score! Have fun like I did in this exciting good game! :)
