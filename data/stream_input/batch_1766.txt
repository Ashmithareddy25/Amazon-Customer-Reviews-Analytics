B008Q09K2U|5.0|This is another great story told by a master. It still doesn't reach the heights of The Lions Game but it just as grippping and of course the on-going wit of John Corey just makes the book so much more readable and you just can not put it down.<br />Bring on more!!!<br />Peter Sands
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I downloaded quick office after trying office pro and olive premium and that the Quick Office for 0.99 was a really great buy!<br />I give it 5 stars and will buy the upgrade for 4.99!
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I got about halfway through and couldn't take any more.  Slow pace, characters boring, and way too descriptive. The abundance of 5 star reviews makes me wonder how many of them were paid for.  I've never read a book that was so highly rated, yet so disliked by myself.

B004WMKSH2|5.0|This was another great movie for Harry Potter fans; can't wait to watch the sequel! Although i'll be sad when it's over; last Harry Potter film....
B000SGSU58|5.0|When I can't put down a book I know it is good. When I can't put down a series of books I know I have hit the mother lode. I'm still reading about Harry's adventures as an LAPD homicide detective but I literally can't put these books down except for today since we're loading our moving van to move to the LA area and, yes, I have a list of Harry's haunts I want to visit when I have some free time. I hope the series never ends...
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I liked it because I like the Harry Potter series and I enjoyed watching a movie after reading the book.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I love all things Disney and I loved the story line.  It is a great movie for the family and there were important lessons for children and adults. As usual the animation was outstanding.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|This is a great first album by Phillip Phillips. I am glad that &#34;Home&#34; was included, but the original tracks are just great with that unique Phillip Phillips sound. If you liked him on Idol, I highly recommend this album!
B002MCD0GU|3.0|This movie had a few laughs, but a pretty uneven effort compared to the Borat Movie. Your mileage may vary.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|My whole family has caught the superhero movie bug.  While some superhero/comic book based movies have left a lot to be desired, this one was fun enough that we saw it in 3D opening weekend and again at the second run theater in town.  Then, we waited with heavy anticipation for this one to land on our doorstep to savor during one of our pizza-and-movie family nights.  This package did not disappoint.  We added the extras to our iPad and explored along with the movie as it ran for a second time that weekend.  Pure entertainment.<br /><br />Now, the countdown to Iron Man 3 begins...*sigh*.
B007MJSYF0|2.0|The quality of the movie was not good, kept buffering for obtain connection and the movie itself was not what I expected. Glad it was over.
B0044CBMVG|4.0|Maybe it is the nerd side of me that keeps making me come back to this show - not fully certain, but I'm a fan for sure.  The seasons have been rather variable over the years, with changes in relationship dynamics, Jeffersonian staff, and now the baby.  Some would say the shark has been jumped, but I hope this show hangs around for a bit longer.  I'm not a horror movie fan, but I do enjoy the soft gross-ness of the bones and guts found at the various scenes.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Enjoyed it. Just to purchased to pass the time away turned out to be entertaining, the movie needed to buffer often though.

0679720200|2.0|* My true review is 2.5 stars. I think it to be more a 2 than a 3.<br />* I did not read it for luxury or enjoyment. It was an assignment.<br />* Please read this from the point of view of a student in English class.<br /><br />This book does its job relatively well. It is thought-provoking, disturbing, and well written. I enjoyed the writing itself. Fundamentals, indeed, good job, round of applause.<br /><br />This book was, in the end, about a view of life different from what I have. I was not, however, doomed to hate it for that reason alone. But dislike it, I certainly did.<br />I am in no way the kind of person who enjoys nothing but uplifting and happy literature. I enjoy the thought behind this book, its unique presentation using the main character as a symbol of human consciousness on the most basic level, and the way even his view was presented. I respect it to a degree. I do, however, shortly after finishing it, find that the useful thought behind the supposed moral was completely lost in a tornado of hopelessness. Even the ideas of the book were swept up into doom- a screeching, hard slam against a wall that stops you completely.<br />Where this book and its ideas went seemed so beyond anything that can have a name, \\"existentialism\\". It just seems like an excuse to be absurd to me.<br />You may not agree with my impression, but as a single reader, this is what I got. Nothing but hopelessness. In the end, everything was nothing. I have a big problem with this idea in general, and I found myself feeling like the chaplain at the end, with tears in his eyes, trying to no avail to change an unchangeable man. The character was a sort of anti-human whom I could not understand or relate to, however hard I tried, and whose ideas were so wrought with a suggestion that simply seems idiotic and null to mention that I am still finding that my thoughts are overlapping.<br />If what this character thought were true, and everyone on earth came to believe it someday, then I don't think the world would exist. I don't think anything would. There would be absolutely nothing behind it. It would make no sense, and nothing as great as the universe can possibly be so senseless and pointless. As this man might agree, there should be reason behind everything- and past our fluid human consciousness, I am positive that there is.<br />Sitting here now I realize that this might simply be the point of \\"existentialism\\", and that this sort of thing is allowed. If that is the case I hope to avoid this kind of literature in the future. Even then I did not enjoy this book and I wish I did not have to read it. It depressed me and drowned out my curious thought, and instead of thinking about life and pondering like I thought I would be at the beginning, I couldn't help but wonder what the point of being upset OR pondering was. A book that does that is simply out of my comprehension. Maybe I'm simply too above or below the thought (your call!) to appreciate this. I can only hope so. But even then, I presume that would be pointless too.<br /><br />To be fair: if you enjoy this sort of writing, and want to get so deep that you don't even know where you are anymore, and wish to be quite likely disturbed, then read this as you can probably handle it.<br />If you are looking for a regular book, or simply a thought-provoking one, look elsewhere to books that offer items you can actually utilize.<br /><br />Good riddance to The Stranger.I don't think the world would exist.

B000BB1MI2|5.0|I've seen this movie before and didn't like it because the whole time I'm just comparing it to the orginial movie. This is definitely a different take on a remake but I thought it was very well done. Johnny Depp is so weird and is just an amazing character actor. But if you think it's going to be just like the originial, don't waste your time. If this movie wouldn't have been a remake and instead been an original, people may have sung a different tune. Try and watch it again, for the &#34;first&#34; time, maybe with an open mind.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could not pit this book down.  During each moment in the book I felt what the characters felt & was sickened when I smelled what they smelled.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|On a scale on 1-10 how bad is the pain? This book it's a 10 (10 x a million to be exact).<br /><br />*The next rant possibly contains spoilers.. so if you haven't read the book wait to read my review. Also, I am not reviewing this in any set form as I would usually, because I am have so many things to say about this book.*<br /><br />I will start by saying, this book is amazingly written and beautifully tragic. It left it's mark. I love it and I hate it! The love of my (book) life died last night and my heart is still reeling. Just the thought of TFIOS leaves me in a puddle of tears. Everyone has been up in arms about it, and I have had it on my tbr list. The funny part, I had NO clue what this book was about. I just borrowed with the expectations that it would be good. But when I learned this was a book about cancer, I knew it wouldn't end well.<br /><br />I fell in love with Augustus Winters.. who wouldn't!?! His character had such a big heart.. he was funny, giving, kind... beautiful! He wasn't down due to the fact that he had one leg, he wasn't down because most of his friends were dead or dying. He was a wish fulfiller and even after he was gone he still managed to giving Hazel Grace her wishes. I loved him for the egg scene and even more for editing his eulogy.<br /><br />I liked that he was a tenured professor in the Department of Slightly Crooked Smiles with a dual appointment in the Department of Having a Voice That Made My Skin Feel More Like Skin.<br /><br />Side notes: I am from Indiana, and have visited most of the places mentioned in this book. I had no clue who John Green was, nor the fact that we shared a state. My obviously small minded self, had serious doubts that a Green could deliver a convincing female POV, in which he proved me wrong!! I also work in the research field that seeks to improve (hopefully cure) cancer, and this book is quite possibly the best motivation.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I love the versitility of Johnny Depp, he can play many different role personalities and still will not be out of character.  Some parts were funny, overall it was ok.
1451620829|5.0|Tells it like it is in the life of rock n roll.  I don't read much because I don't really have the time, but this is one book I wish I could read all the way through in one sitting. I find it very interesting and well written from one of my favorite drummers. It tells of his view of rock and roll and the band with what I sense to be with honesty, doesn't seem to be hiding or twisting the truth about anything. A true look into one of many great rock and roll heros lifestyles. I also read Ace Frehley's book and pieces of the same stories do match up. All in all a great book and I'm only half way through it.

B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This DVD is basically TV form, but without commercials. Once one is done, the nest comes right after the credits, which aren't very long. Each episode is about forty five minutes, great for a long road trip. Definitely worth the price!
B00846REIS|5.0|Just like fifty shades of grey, if not better! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the fifty shades series.
B009AMANBA|5.0|To say that Daniel Day-Lewis inhabits the title role feels like such a total understatement. The iconic role has been the career-peaking touchstone for dozens of esteemed actors since the dawn of cinema including Henry Fonda, Raymond Massey (who earned an Oscar nomination in 1940 for his Lincoln), Gregory Peck, and even cast member Hal Holbrook (who plays Republican leader Francis Preston Blair here), but none have come across with the deceptively casual verisimilitude of Day-Lewis in Steven Spielberg's masterful 2012 historical drama. The versatile actor is able to bring multiple layers of human dimension to a public figure known to us only through books, marble statues, or perhaps a childhood trip to Disneyland where he remains an animatronic mannequin in \\"Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln\\". Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner ([[ASIN:1854599828 Angels in America]]) wisely do not attempt an episodic treatment of Lincoln's life but rather focus on January 1865, a critical month at the beginning of the President's second term when he was undergoing the most important event of his life.<br /><br />Based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's superb treatise, [[ASIN:B000N2HBSO Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln]], the 150-minute film focuses on the conundrum he faced in pushing the 13th amendment, the abolition of slavery, through the House of Representatives toward legislation while facing immense pressure among all factions to end the now-four-year-old Civil War and reclaim the Confederacy into the Union. The movie's deliberately narrow focus allows us to see Lincoln as a relatable human being, someone with a determined sense of mission but also less than ideal with a surprising albeit understandable streak of opportunism that a broader biopic would have glossed over. It also means the story consists of subtle moments rather than milestone events that would signal the next historical battle. Although Spielberg bookends the film with unblinking scenes of carnage true to the period, the film relies primarily on the human drama that comes from the argument of opposing ideas and the minutiae of political strategy used to win favor among influential politicos<br /><br />It's a story that has obvious relevance to the Washington political scene of today. The movie also examines the additional burden Lincoln was experiencing with his fractious home life. He struggles to keep the peace with his tempestuous wife Mary still grieving over the death of their third son Willie three years earlier, as well as their first-born Robert who becomes desperate to enlist in the Union Army against his parents' wishes. Kushner's superbly understated screenplay lets the plotlines intertwine organically and keeps Spielberg's tendency toward bravura filmmaking in check. Only toward the end when we recognize what is about to happen to Lincoln did I feel Spielberg's use of unspoken prescience a bit too heightened. The performances are stunning examples of what great filmmaking can generate with the right cast. Day-Lewis' Lincoln is for the ages. It amazes me that Liam Neeson was attached to the project for six years before generously abandoning it because Day-Lewis appears born to play the role. With a choked Midwestern tenor, he vividly evokes a man gifted at conflict resolution and oratory splendor but not above manipulating information to achieve the greater good.<br /><br />Two other performances are nearly as stellar. Tommy Lee Jones hones in on his particular brand of irascibility to bring fiery abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens to life, and Kushner gives him the lion's share of clever vitriol in the script. As Mary, Sally Field is a constant presence but has probably about three showy scenes where she is able to show her considerable talent to the full. Nearly a half-century since [[ASIN:B000E3L7DM Gidget]] and more than a decade older than Day-Lewis, this diminutive actress gained 25 pounds and defies the odds by immersing herself completely into all the conflicting impulses that made Mary such a complicated, controversial historical figure. There are five Oscars among this accomplished trio, and more could very well be forthcoming. Many other actors in the expansive cast are worthy of mention, including James Spader's surprisingly amusing turn as a Republican lobbyist, Hal Holbrook's avuncular bluster as Blair, Gloria Reuben's quiet fortitude as Mary's confidant Elizabeth Keckley, and David Straitharn providing a jittery voice of reason as Secretary of State William Seward. A few actors like the omnipresent Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert are not given enough time to flesh out their characters. Regardless, it's a masterful film that captures lightning in a bottle.letely into all the conflicting impulses that made Mary such a complicated, controversial historical figure.

B006LSZECO|5.0|A lot of mystery novels claim they'll keep you guessing. This one actually delivers on that promise. I came to this as more of a fan of literary fiction over genre stuff, but I think fans of both will find a lot to like here.
0061474355|5.0|I forget exactly when or who in my family first picked up Sabriel at the library, but it has been my favorite book ever since turning that first page.  Sabriel is an instantly loveable character who you root for all the way through some pretty heroic and somewhat terrifying feats.  Her companion through the book is a witty white cat, whom I fully intend on naming a pet cat after someday.  If only my cat could talk back as snarkily to me!<br /><br />If you are a fan of strong female leads, adventure in unknown, but somehow familiar landscapes and peril, then Sabriel (and the rest of the Abhorsen trilogy) is for you!  It's well written, well edited and well printed (unlike some books in recent years *cough* the hunger games *cough*); so no typos, great descriptions and fully fleshed character development.  You'll quickly find yourself re-reading it multiple times a year, listening to the books on tape (read by the great Tim Curry!!), and dreaming of living in the Old Kingdom.  It's just one of those books you want to crawl inside and live in and never have end!

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Some of the reviews I have seen on the Wise Man's Fear claim that it doesn't quite reach the level of the Name of the Wind, but sequels so often do. While it doesn't reach the greatness of the Name of the Wind, Wise Man's Fear still delivers. We get more of Kvothe's story, both of his past and hints about how he got to where he is during the present time of the story. This sequel does a lot at looking into Kvothe's character, not how he acts, but how he feels. The relationship with Denna in this book takes on a whole new aspect, and it works. The only thing about this book is that it really does nothing with the Chandrian and the Amyr, which is kind of the overarching plot to the series, but what it doesn't to advance that part of the book, it does a lot in advancing Kvothe as a person. Anyways, this book isn't like a sequel that you would have to muddle through just because you feel obligated to finish it for the series. The read is still a very good one, and can easily be read. The plot is paced right, and we get the same witty Kvothe that we've grown to love.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|I like very much the music of George, and this CD specially.<br /><br />I would recommend it to all George's fans.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I know I'm a little late to the coming out party for The Name of the Wind, and since then Rothfuss has written the sequel, but this book simply blew me away. Rothfuss delivers an amazing read in his debut. Kvothe is the clever, witty, human character that can easily be loved by readers, and Rothfuss plays of that excellently. Not only that, but the plot Rothfuss develops is one that actually makes since for Kvothe (I won't give any spoilers). We don't see a book where the main character is able to just breeze through his problems, which someone like Kvothe would be easily able to do in most scenarios. In some books the author makes the characters around the plot, but this doesn't seem the case with Kvothe. We get a strong, likeable character, who could easily overcome many obstacles, but instead, he's faced with things that are tough for even him. This is the only book I have ever read twice, and I loved it even more the second time a read it. If you're ever looking for something that isn't only interesting to read, but also fun and exciting, pick up the Name of the Wind, and you will not be disappointed.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|A Clash of Kings was equally as intriguing and fun to read as A Game of Thrones.  If you liked the first book in the series, you'll like this one as well.  It starts off a bit slow with even more names and places to learn, but quickly picks up speed in a race to the end.
B008MEM24S|4.0|If you aren't a fan of Phineas and Ferb, then save your money and play &#34;Where's my water&#34;. But I love the cameos by Major Monogram, Carl, and Doofenshmirtz and it's a fun puzzle game.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Wild is about Cheryl Strayed who endured the death of her mother, a divorce, several broken relationships, and a string of poor life choices before deciding to hike the Pacific Crest Trail...alone.  The memoir tells of her decision to take the hike and details the highs and lows (literally and figuratively) of her journey.<br /><br />It is well-written and engaging which makes it an easy and quick read.  Although some parts are cringe-worthy (isn't it always when you are on the outside looking in on someone else's life?), it was an enjoyable book.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|I thought this was a neat story and do not regret renting it. The movie doesn't beat around the bush on the idea of &#34;class warfare&#34;, and the screenplay writer was clever to make everyone stop aging in their mid-20s. That lets the director cast a bunch of popular actors and actresses, who I think did good jobs. Vincent Kartheiser stole the show as the megalomaniac banker who in any other movie would have to be played by an older actor. If you go into the movie knowing there are plot holes and inconsistencies, you can enjoy a movie worth talking about the next day.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Can anyone think of collaboration between composer and director in Hollywood that has ever been as fruitful as that of John Williams and Steven Spielberg?<br /><br />Unless you count the one between Bernard Herrmann and Alfred Hitchcock (which didn't end so well for either man), or Ennio Morricone and Sergio Leone (which ended with Leone's passing in 1989), there really hasn't been one.<br /><br />Whether it's the soaring textures of E.T., the menace of JAWS and JURASSIC PARK, the nobility of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, or the dark Jewish undertones of SCHINDLER'S LIST, Williams has proven to be a great foil for Spielberg's style of filmmaking ever since the two first worked together on THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS in 1974.  And once again, with the score for LINCOLN, the Williams/Spielberg collaboration reaches yet another milestone.<br /><br />Utilizing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus (Spielberg shot the film in Illinois and Virginia), Williams provides one more great score for a film that explores the most pivotal three months in the development of our nation as presided over by the man, Abraham Lincoln (portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis), who is arguably our nation's greatest president, as he tries to end the Civil War and to pass the all-important 13th Amendment to the Constitution that will put an end to slavery for all time.  The score reflects Lincoln's trials and tribulations, and also utilizes traditional Civil War anthems (\\"The Battle Cry Of Freedom\\"), and even old-timey Appalachian-style instrumentation (fiddle; mandolin; claw hammer banjo) on the cues \\"Getting Out The Vote\\" and \\"Race To The House.\\"  And as Williams is so often wont to do, he even evokes Aaron Copland in the noble \\"Petersen House/Finale\\" cue, which may remind one of Copland's stirring work for narrator and orchestra \\"A Lincoln Portrait.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line here is that, much as Spielberg has made films that people are going to remember throughout the ages, so too has Williams created music for those films that will also live throughout the ages.  LINCOLN is a tremendous addition to this collaborative canon, and must seriously be considered for any awards afforded to it.

It starts off funny and ends with an explosion of smaltz.Pat Solitano(Bradley Cooper)is released after 8 months from a state psychiatric institution after having nearly beaten a man to death,into the care of his mother(Jacki Weaver) and father(Robert De Niro).He is a handful and very explosive,waking up in the middle of the night,telling his parents he doesn't accept a Hemingway book he's reading,then proceeding to turn over the house to look for his wedding video.His wife Nicki has taken out a restraining order against him.He wants to slim and read through all her high school English books, improving himself to get back to her.Then he meets the mysterious Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence),a young widow who's just as volatile and medicated as himself.She agrees to help blunt and tactless Pat rebuild his marriage but has an odd favour to ask in return,to join her in a dance competition and train with her for it.David  O'Russell is good on indie-type films like Three Kings,Spanking the Monkey.This has an indie sensibility.<br /><br />This film has some outstanding performances especially the central one of Jennifer Lawrence,without whom the film would have dropped off the radar.De Niro too is superb as the father who wants to bond with his son and opens himself up,yet also seeks to integrate him into his life,yet is at the receiving end of the potential violence Pat is able to unleash.Jacki Weaver is good as the mother who thinks everything can be made right with crab-cakes.Chris Tucker is good also as a fellow sufferer he met in the institution.There are some well-rounded cameos of minor characters and scenes,e.g. when Tiffany and Pat go to have a meal at Tiffany's friend Veronica's and Tiffany and Pat are just too honest,saying they want to leave half way through,not interested in the lies and half-truths of suburban life.Pat has a tendency to get into fights,a characteristic he shares with his dad.I thought Cooper had a tendency to mistake quirkiness for bipolarity and mixed the two up.I also think the dance competition/rom.com dissipates the real urgency of the mental illness as a subject. One for the Oscars and prepare to take your hankies!Entertaining rather than deep.The silver lining of Hollywood.
1451695195|3.0|I liked the book because I enjoy NDE and related topics in general. I think anyone interested in afterlife studies would benefit from reading it, as would some skeptics and scientific types. But if you're distracted by poor structure and things like run-on sentences, you may have a hard time getting through this book. Dr. A, understandably, is much more fascinated by the complex workings of the neurocortex than the typical reader would be. Long passages about brain function are interwoven with tales of his other-wordly and family experiences in a way that's a bit awkward. I hope he'll consider using a ghost writer in subsequent editions. Still, the story is fascinating enough and the price low enough to give it a read.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I have only watched through episode 4. Am having to pace myself. We don't get showtime so I want to wait til I can get the second season to watch continuously. It's hard though, the kinda show you wanna curl up on the couch and devour the first season in one sitting. Fantastic!
B007TMON8M|5.0|Love this game! Not only does it force you to think, but it rewards you for it. The previous reviews I read were a bit extensive, so I will try to be brief. Once I got through the levels, I challenged myself to get three stars on each, then to make the top of the high score list. Knowing I made the cheapest working blueprint of the day is my favorite part. Great app for a quick break.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I love this case and everyone who sees my Kindle remarks on it. It is sturdy and provides good protection without being too bulky. It also fits around the Kindle tightly. I keep my Kindle in my backpack for school and this case has done a great job keeping it safe with all of my heavy books. I would recommend this to anyone searching for a straightforward non-leather case that doesn't want to add too much weight to their Kindle.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I liked that the violence was kept at a minimum.<br />The cast and costumes were excellent.<br />A good family film
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I literally could not put this book down. Some people criticise the premise of this story, but if you truly think about the world these people live in... desperate times lead to desperate measures. Once you keep your mind open to the idea of this story and what these people have to go through, you will really be able to understand the dynamic twists and hidden jabs at the politics of this world. The ending is a bit of a sudden stop, but luckily for us the next books are out and you can keep reading this series. If you are looking for a good read, start now and be prepared to not want to put it down!
6305428042|5.0|Chose all 5 stars to  rate Hocus Pocus as it's enjoyable for ANY age and actually has a good plot. Plus Bette Midler is super halerious!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books were so much better than I expected. I was hooked by the first chapter of the first book. I even told my kids they had to read the books before we would see the movie. Suzanne Collins has a true gift in writing.
B00013F38K|4.0|Very first movie of Kung Fu was great and David Carradine did a spectacular job portraying a Shalom priest being so humble yet, had the karate moves!
B007SGM084|5.0|These are the best books I have ever read. I even have a few other people reading these. I could read these over and over. E L James truly has the gift of writing. I truly hope she writes more!
B005JU5JTI|1.0|Kind of bummed. I thought it would be better. I wouldn't say don't watch it but don't waste a lot of money on it.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|excellent,thought-provoking movie...got my attention from first scene to the last...we..are..not..alone! I just love these kind of movies...makes you wonder what if?
B003E88TKS|4.0|I had to watch it for class. We discussed the lifestyle of the main character and how it related to the other characters.
B006YC74E8|5.0|I haven't used this yet. I have used the camera; however don't know how to edit. I'm just learning to use the Kindle.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It followed nicely after the previous movie. Good adventure and a little over the top action scenes, but that is what most people want (not me). I close my eyes when the screen starts moving too fast.:)
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I've been a big fan from there first recording together, not to mention their individual recordings.  The only thing I hate is I can't seem to catch these guys in concert.  I will anxiously await their next recording.
1423140605|5.0|This book followed very well after the previous books in the series. I enjoy this author. I enjoyed reading this book. My grandchildren have read it and my sons also, so it will be well used.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Loved this  book.  The more I read and got to know Pat, the more I liked him and had sympathy for him. What a great character he was. I enjoyed unfolding his story through his eyes and hearing the way he described his world through his mental illness was touching. He made me laugh and cry many times and I was always rooting for him. In fact, all the characters were so strong, I loved them all and felt like I knew them. Tiffany was different but I enjoyed getting to know her and her story and thought the friendship between her and pat was funny and authentic. Great book!  It will stick with me for a long time - all the best ones do!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book is great.  I love the way Kate Morton weaves a story - it keeps you wondering until the end of the book  And it is a nice long read - something else I love.  Hope she writes another one real soon!
0062127241|4.0|Good year by year accounting of the motivation and forces behind Pete's song writing and the band's history.  Recommended for serious WHO fans.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Used it with a Macbook Pro Laptop and Mac ENC Navigation program. Very sensitive even inside the boat just put it near the front windshield

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a very well written trilogy. You feel as if you know the characters on a personal level. You find yourself on an emotional roller coaster. I highly recommend this trilogy; you will find you can't put it down!
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Does what it is supposed to do (and quickly) with no fuss.  That has to be the gold standard for a CPU.  You just don't have a need to think about it, except in a positive sense.  This CPU can be overclocked, if that is your thing, but not as much as the K series cousin.  The trade off is that this chip has all sorts of security and virtualization functionality the K series doesn't.  Take your pick, you will be happy with your choice.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Just like everyone else says, every song is great. \\"Little Talks\\" is well known, but it's just one of many outstanding tracks. Saw them live November 2012, and they were excellent. They were also very appreciative and a little overwhelmed by the size of the crowd in the sold-out venue. It's nice to support a band on their way up. Can't wait for the next album and/or live show.
B003IY48PS|5.0|Who could've imagined Ash in HD thirty years ago? Maybe Sam Raimi did, but he's a visionary. This is the original that started it all... without this one to set the stage we would've never had the pleasure of hearing,\\"Hail to the King, baby!\\"
B008JGSM6G|3.0|...and it kept asking me to log into amazon store. You can keep bypassing it, but that got annoying. I uninstalled the game.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|Absolute classic! This whole series MADE Bruce Campbell. He's not bad in 'Burn Notice', but this is his defining role for sure. For those who don't know, 'Evil Dead 2' is a bit of a re-boot of the original 'Evil Dead', but both are classics. You NEED to see this one before you watch 'Army of Darkness'. Confound your friends with all the classic one-liners you pick up from watching these films!
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|when i bought the product it worked fine, but after about couple of weeks of use it was not working. this is too expensive for it just to break down after 2 weeks of use. compared to the cheaper ones this really sucks. DON'T BUY if i could i would give this a 0 star.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|Still the badass Bond of Daniel Craig - who is my new #1 007, with Connery as a very close second - but not near the excitement of Casino Royale.  It does, however, begin right were Casino left off, and finishes the story nicely.  Looking forward to seeing the third Craig installment in theaters soon.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have never found another pair of headphones quite like these and doubt I ever will again . I dislike earbuds , I have tiny ears and find buds hurt and are always falling out. I have been using these style of headphones for well over six years now and  am hooked on Sony's headphone . They are lightweight and the sound quality is amazing. Nike has a similar style but it cost like 60+ dollars for the same thing. I use my headphones in the gym to block out the noise of other  weightlifters and the headphones do great being tossed around my gym bag or back pack . Most of my pairs have lasted at least six months , the only pair that died sooner was the pair I had on while I was on a run and was caught  in a downpour .
B000MRA5NS|5.0|From a die-hard Bond fan who grew up with Connery and Moore, I honestly think Daniel Craig is the best 007 yet.  He's brutal, unflinching, and an absolute bad mo-fo.  1080p HD just makes it all the better.
0385536828|3.0|Slow going and rather boring for the first three quarters. Very detailed and somewhat confusing -- needlessly so. The final 20 pages or so are terrific, and these sort of make the read worthwhile, but do not read them before the rest of the book or you will waste your time and have no understanding of what's happening. This certainly is no \\"Atonement\\". Overall I expect much more from Ian McEwan..
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app! It is so useful to me and has been for a long time. I love the variation of options we have as well as the ease with the layout. One of the supreme note apps of the few I've been exposed to or used.
0316228532|1.0|I loved the Harry Potter Books because of the positive tone to them.  This story was just too dark for me.  The humor eluded me - which might be due to the fact that I am an American instead of British.
B0091LS07E|4.0|De Novo Adagio (intro) - A short and simple intro that showcases the classically trained skills that some may have forgotten Ms. Keys possessed. Would have been lovely if this were longer with lyrics attached. I wonder what that would have sounded like.<br /><br />Brand New Me - The intro goes straight into this song, which actually brings the lyrics that I hoped to hear mentioned above. I think this song is a personal note to all of her critiques out there that have had issues with the way her personal life has resulted to the past few years. She talks about her growth, and how no one should be mad or feel bad for the changes that have occurred with her. This song is about accepting oneself, and not worrying about the opinions of others. It's a really good song with a poignant message. However, there were essences of straining in some areas of the song.<br /><br />When It's All Over - Right away reminded me of an old school, late 60s/early 70s kind of feel. I really appreciate the different directions that are shown throughout this album. This song is about accepting the fact that you loved someone, regardless of the amount of time you had with that individual. It's about living the love in the moment, and not worrying about what may happen tomorrow. I don't think it has a foreboding vibe or nature to it, but more-so growing old with someone and enjoying the time you have with them, for life is impossible to foretell. And the inclusion of her son at the end was sweet.<br /><br />Listen to Your Heart - Smooth mellow song that would definitely fit on the adult r&b contemporary stations. I think this would definitely fit into that vein. The title of the song essentially reads the entirety of the song. It's about listening to your heart and going after what it tells you. Going after what you truly desire when it comes to love. About not fighting what is in front of you or meant for you.<br /><br />New Day - Boom. That is what I first thought when the beat blared through my headphones. Alicia Keys and crew are able to converse piano keys with heavy bass and different beats, which not everyone is capable to do. This is about rebirth, and getting ready and prepared for that celebration. This is a song that will definitely be on repeat. Though I can't say I loved the ending. If they could fix that, I would be in love.<br /><br />Girl on Fire (feat Nicki Minaj) - I appreciate the fact that Nicki did not bring her alters to this song. She was serious, or portrayed her lyrics with the modicum of seriousness that this song needed. This song is about women who are strong, strong-willed, independent and capable. So many people fit this image and can relate to it, so it's sort of an anthem for every kind of woman out there, wherever you come from.<br /><br />Fire We Make - I love Maxwell. I will always be one that appreciates his music and see his concrete, genuine and accurate talent. It's amazing that he doesn't have more Grammys. Alicia starts this song off attempting to get close to hitting some of those high notes/falsettos that Maxwell is famously known for. This is a very sultry and sexy song. It was very strong of her to include Maxwell on here.<br /><br />Tears Always Win - This song brings me back to the Diary of Alicia Keys. Again, it has the old school flavor involved, maybe circa the 50s/60s. I could see this being a single. One of my favorites off the entire album.<br /><br />Not Even the King - Short and simple song about love being the only thing you really need to take from a relationship. Materialism and all of the extra stuff can only last so long.<br /><br />That's When I Knew - Interesting use of a guitar utilized in this song. Something I wouldn't exactly expected from Alicia Keys. It's about surrendering to the obviousness of loving or falling in love with someone. Sometimes people make it so hard, but the simple things can at times help you realize the reality the situation.<br /><br />Limitedless - What can I say about this song besides the creation of a new word? Reggae/island influenced, which actually isn't foreign to this artist. It's a very catchy song about love being relatable to an infinity of possibilities.<br /><br />One Thing - I can't say that this will be one of my favorite songs on the album. She sings about choosing 'one thing' over anything else. That can be interpreted as anything to just about anybody (which could be a good thing), but when it comes to specifics I think she is speaking of her son. There are moments where she strains a bit.<br /><br />101 - The longest track on the album. Starts out very quiet and relaxed.The message I get is basically what sets you apart? For her it's putting 101% percent in everything. It has a strong ending (which I very much liked), but her voice definitely strains.<br /><br />Girl On Fire is vulnerable, playful, soulful and empowering. These are some of the definite themes interlaced throughout the whole album. Yet love seems to be the main one that carries the others. It is obvious that Alicia Keys is especially happy with her life at the moment, and because of that and her talent she has been able to showcase that throughout her music for her fans. She has gone through an evolution that is very clear, and she is one that allows and can portray it in her music. She is a talented individual. However, I have to say that I am worried about her vocal ability. In some of the songs on this album it was seeming a bit strained, or rather raspy, and I see it has transitioned from her stage performance to her studio album. I think one Vivian Greene is in the same genre with her album The [[ASIN:B008OHV4P6 Green Room]] where I mentioned the same thing in my review there.  I know many hope for her (or even the both of them) to take care of her voice so she will have no worries on sustaining a lengthy career.out this song besides the creation of a new word?

0316069434|5.0|I've read all of the Harry Bosch novels and I love every one of them. Michael Connelly is a terrific writer and I really enjoy his books.
B006H5120E|5.0|Although seen many times, this 3D Blu Ray DVD makes it a whole new expierence.  The movie is so crystal clear, the 3D makes it come alive, you are &#34;in the scenes&#34;.  This would make a wonderful holiday gift.  I would recommend this to a friend.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|With each album from Rihanna I become a bigger fan. I am really impressed at how she puts out album after album and multiple #1 singles on each album. Rihanna is a true Superstar.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I saw Avengers at the movies.....twice. It was a must have for my collection of Blu Rays. I've got the unction to pop it in now! Great characters and great storyline.
B000L53D4O|5.0|it will be a great learning experience for my granson it will be a beatiful experience for him be learning with the toy i recommended to other people to buy this product
B0058VW36U|5.0|Lots of fun Makes you use your mind Makes me laugh everyone should get this game fro the money lots of playtime
B004UID2LC|5.0|This application is pretty awesome. I love being able to watch you tube videos that are now downloaded to my phone.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|The price was good and it arrived quickly.  The combo pack with blu-ray and dvd plus the digital copy is always great, you can watch you movie anywhere.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Never was a fan of Rod Stewart but I love Christmas music and had heard a sample from this album. I love it! It is rather &#34;old school&#34;, good classic tunes with a soothing quality to his voice. Highly recommend if you enjoy singing along to Christmas music.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Cloud Atlas was the kind of book I didn't want to end, I wanted there to be more stories, or for each story to be longer.  While some could criticise the author for not exploring each character/plot sufficiently, I think this was intentional, and very much reflects the nature of the stories (letters, journals...) in which you do only get to glimpse the surface.  The structure of the book may not please everyone but I loved it, there were only a few moments when it seemed trite, but they were more than made up for by mostly brilliant writing and truly interesting characters/ideas.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|Lovely to revisit such a talented artist.  'Little Dorrit' and 'Barnaby Rudge' are my pick as the most enjoyable if not universally regarded as his best.  Everyone must read Dickens before they die! Reading 'Bleak House\\" as I write this review - which is shaping up as delightful (although there is blackness to come). The inclusion of his \\"unfinished symphony\\" 'The Mystery of Edmund Drood' with the addition of one of the many attempts to complete it by others serves to showcase Dickens brilliance in writing.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely LOVE these books! I read all 3 books twice in 9 days, the story grabbed me and I couldn't put them down. Wouldn't have taken that long if I didn't have to sleep or go to work... The sex scenes didn't bother me as they have some people. FABULOUS BOOKS!!!
B0015AARJI|4.0|If you have ever played a Sony console this controller will sit in your hands like it was barely even there. I prefer this to the bulkier approach of the Xbox 360 controller. Not to mention the rechargeable battery pack that has a pretty good life span.<br /><br /> My only complaint is that the controller seems to make a lot of \\"poppy\\" noises that I can hear through headsets when playing online, especially the ([])button.
B0037VIBGY|3.0|Yeah, this movie had it's good parts, but for the most part was annoying. Then again people tell me that Clockwork Orange and Requiem For A Dream are amazing, and I think those movies should be forgotten for all time, as they were terrible.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my friend showed this to me and I'm officially addicted!! great way to pass the time. I love puzzles and I love this because it is a great way to exercise your mind.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! It is a low budget movie, and it is noticeable, and it does involve a considerable amount of suspension of disbelief, but it IS AMAZING!. I recommend it to everyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I ordered two of her other books.  Once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down!
B0063IH60K|5.0|A quick and fun game to fill time and give a stress free challenge. All the ads at the beginning of hand a little tiresome but free app.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of his better books, but a little fractured at points.  They usually flow better, but I still give it a 5 star rating.  I have read every one of his books, he is the greatest.  Yes I would recommend.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|Great for working in confined areas day or night. I have been through several head lights over the years and this one has been the best so far. When I use it, its on my head or laying next to the work (on) for 7 to 8 hours. Its not heavy or hot and batteries seem to last for a long time with the LED bulbs. If this head light completely fails to be useful and ever goes into the great beyond,  I'll replace it with another one.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|For the price it works well, no issues or problems so far. It is lightweight and durable, my daughter is happy with it.
0375507256|4.0|This 2011 Christmas gift collected dust for months after I first tried to read it. I thought the beginning 12 pages were slow, but everything after that was mind-blowingly awesome. It's a smart and beautiful collection of stories.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I'm using this book to publish my latest manuscript on Amazon Kindle. I would have been better of if I had read this book before I began writing.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|The film is ambitious in attempting to dethrone Avatar as the best religio-sci fi film.  Whereas Avatar built on the notions of human foibles and the goodness of animism, complete the holiness of nativism, Prometheus devalues human existence by suggesting that we are the products of alien seeding.  To slap us in the face a second time, the film goes so far as to say that we were a mistake and thus worthy of being wiped out by those who planted us on earth.  The special effects are slightly above average.
B001CEE1US|5.0|this movie is how i imagine an LSD trip is like, the visual effects are incredibly colorful and vibrant, definitely in my top 3 favorite movies given the nostalgia factor and the fun action sequences. great price, great movie. basically the matrix on wheels &#62;:)
B001OKQ7BG|4.0|If you like Elvis or are otherwise into charasmatic performers, you will love this movie.  It has enough behind the scences footage to give it intimacy than one gets from watching a simple on stage performance.
0316044938|5.0|This is an interesting book and probably one of my favorite books I've read this year.  The writer seems to understand pain and loss and shares those things in her words, but she also understands hope and does a beautiful job sharing that feeling as well.<br />The fact that there are over 300 one star reviews is proof that everyone doesn't like every book.  I can't imagine why anyone would hate this book, but some do.  I shake my head in disbelief at those people, but whatever. This is proof that every book isn't for everyone.
B0027ZCQ4E|5.0|The Bourne series, absent the latest rendering without Damon, is addictive.  I have seen each of the three films five or more times.  The Bourne Identity is the best of the three and among my five all-time personal favorite movies.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|It's a great movie with great actors. 3D is amazing, and the price from Amazon couldn't be beat. If you don't like this movie, you might want to check your pulse!
B002SS8S7E|4.0|This movie made me a Christian Bale fan.  He is a fantastic actor and will someday be recognized as great.  The special effects are super and the story shows how a person of wealth can be socially valuable.  That is a nice twist or departure from demonizing those who were born into wealth.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I got it free during a promotion so no complaints. It's not the best music but it is a soundtrack to the movie so.. buy with the right expectations and you'll be happy.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Amazing book to read. Would recommend to anyone who likes fifty shades. Can't wait for entwined with you to be released. Highly recommend
B00866JL96|1.0|Poorly acted.... very poorly. The war scenes were horribly done. Just wasnt a believable movie.<br />and I in general like to look at Zach Effron. But this movie was more then i could stand to watch even with that bonus.<br /><br />Dissapointed in the movie as a whole.<br />and didnt live up to the other Nicholas Sparks book movies
B003TSEEDY|5.0|You just can't stop reading because every page just gives you more to think about. It makes you think about your own life in a completely new way and then the ending changes everything you thought you just figured out.
0062127241|5.0|Yeah. This is a great autobiography. I'd just finished Keith Richards' &#34;Life,&#34; which I loved and this was a great follow-up. More intellectual in a lot of respects. Very Pete, if that makes sense.
075669812X|5.0|I can't wait to give this to my 5 year old.  He adores Ninjago and will absolutely love looking at all of the pictures in this book.  The book is great quality and it's much larger than I anticipated.  It also comes with a minifigure that you can either keep with the book to protect the integrity if you are a collector or to give to your child to play with instead.  A definite must for any Ninjago fan.
030758836X|4.0|Very good book. I like twists, turns and misdirection. I liked the characters and the plot.<br /> My first read of Gillian's will likely read one more.
080214473X|5.0|Great book. Very well written. You feel like you are there. It was a horrifying experience for our troops and it allows you to live it through their eyes and thoughts. Amazing read. Highly recommend it.
B00008RWC2|5.0|This is the best makeup book by far.  Full of great ideas and instructions.  It goes as far as to give step by step instructions on different makeup looks and how to acheive them.  AWESOME book.
0525953728|5.0|This book gives away no secrets as we were possibly led to believe. There are details which allow you on the inside of an incredible operation in the war against terrorism. You are in on the reasons for this type of operation over other means to accomplish the same thing. I read this book and then saw the special on CNN: The Killing of OBL. The book provides much more detail that you might not hear anywhere else. Men and women in special operations help our security and preserve freedom. If we are going to fight the enemy, this seems a much better way to do it.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I was very excited to read this account but found the hype more than the book actually was.  Christians will find the  accounts of the writers meetings with the beingsmofmhis heaven hard to accept.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I believe that the frown above best sums up my feelings about this series....very badly written and cheap aiming story!!
B004ZNARH4|5.0|The immersion box set is amazing.  The remastered disc of the studio album, the live concert from Wembley, the books of photos and other memorabilia:  all are excellent.  But one of the main reasons I bought it was to get disc 6, with an early studio mix of the whole album, a song from the unfinished Household Objects album, and early live and studio versions of On the Run, Us and Them and The Great Gig in the Sky (but with different titles).  You can listen to the evolution of these songs over time before the final album versions were recorded.  This box set is something I had dreamed about years before I even heard rumors that such a box set was going to be released.  Now I just hope that immersion box sets are made of their other albums, such as Meddle and Animals.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it does freeze up every once in a while but I can close it out and reopen it and it works great.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Fun, light , silly Christmas movie.......We've been watching it every year since 2003!!!! My children are 17 and 7 and they each look forward to seeing it.
1451627297|5.0|Dare I say it - my favorite King novel to date. Reading it was somewhat remeniscent of reading James Patterson's [[ASIN:0446676438 When the Wind Blows]] - discovering one of your favorite authors in a genre outside of their norm and loving the writing all the more!<br /><br />I think pretty much everyone knows the plot by now, but I will repeat. Jake Epping has been cornered by a local businessman and coerced into doing the unthinkable - going back in time and completely changing the course of history. Jake decides to experiment first - changing the life of one of his own students, before he takes on the challenge of preventing the Kennedy assassination.<br /><br />Jeannette comments in her review ([...]) about the honesty of the romance in this novel - and indeed maybe a little out of the King norm, but all the better for it.<br /><br />So many reviews complain about the length - my only complaint is that every New Year I start out with sore arms from holding my King books over Christmas break!<br /><br />I will be recommending this to many - and can't wait to see who grabs the movie rights. I'm hoping for a mini-series myself:)
B0043HA1K0|5.0|John legend is my heart, and I absolutely adore the roots, so this album is a win for me. Love it.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Soundgarden is indeed back, and they sound as good as ever! This album feels like a natural progression for them, as if they hadn't taken 15 years off in between albums. Their unique voice has been sorely missed in the world of alternative rock. I can't wait to hear what they do next!
B0099G3I96|5.0|I have always loved No Doubt, and this album does not disappoint. Glad I got it at such an awesome price.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Very Phil Phillips and reminiscent of Mumford and Sons.  Put the car windows down and turn the volume up - this CD takes you for a great ride.
0547884591|5.0|If you read Seth Godin's, The Dip, you know that being the best in the world will get you what you want. Armed with Tim's gorgeous thesis on learning you only need to put the effort and you're there. Myself being a neuroscientist and pianist, I know how hard it is to get good at things. Every once in a while you discover a method that allows you to do something like you've never before , and you say \\"if I only knew about this years ago!\\" This is one of those. If you ever wanted to learn ANYTHING, you need this book, ASAP! I've already used the memorization tricks to learn all the 101 two-letter scrabble words in a couple hours. I can still write every single one of them days after not thinking about it, and I have a terrible memory, just ask my wife ;-). Discover it for yourself.
145210655X|4.0|Cute and kinda short but a great table book. My wife, son and I all liked it for different reasons. I would have given it 5 stars but for the price it needed to be a bit longer.
0345529057|5.0|Earlier bindings were not so robust, but this collection has not fallen apart. It is thus easy to re-read or loan out to others.
B0045XICB2|4.0|I was catching up to see the final film.  It was enjoyable, the acting seems to be improving. Worth seeing
B008602KQI|5.0|Came in the mail in perfect condition. I had already saw the movie and just wanted to own it and watch again.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|it was a lot smaller than I thought and for the price it is not worth it! I do not get what the hype was all about
B00A5052YE|5.0|This is Alicia Keys' best album and the songs are inspiring and very in depth! Such a strong and inspirational artist. SHE has proven herself worthy of being called THE QUEEN OF R&B AND SOUL. Please buy this album!
B007X15GRQ|4.0|Drama with plenty of action expect the unexpected Mark is great at his job but you be the judge I recommend it.
B009P5S11G|1.0|this album is same as any other rihanna's cd, only have a couple of ok tracks and thats it. what a waste on with a good voice she has.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's GGGGrrrreeattt ! If you are into horror with lots of action this is for you; This movie seems more like a drama, mystery with action and horror all rolled into one. But the directors do it sooo good all you do is enjoy every minute of this film. Make no mistake it is a gory- bloody mess; but each season of the walking dead has you craving for more two thumbs up and 5 stars is my rating hope you enjoy it.
1451695187|5.0|I liked this book  because I lost the love of my life of 52 years and 8 months on 19 Apr 2010.  Although I have always believed the Bible, this book lets me know beyond a doubt that when I am called home,  June will be there to meet me.  I especially  liked the Poem that was attached to the picture of Dr Alexander's blood sister who had died earlier and she was the young woman who guided Dr Alexander around  heaven.  I plan to have the poem read at my funeral for my two Children and gradchildren.  With a slight modification June an angel took my hand.<br /><br />James H. Addy
B00062PN6I|5.0|There great expected them in white. But silver is cool to. There great, light they are what I like looks, and adjustment that look great on me. Headphones are nice when I am creating music mixes and etc.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|well worth the price.  my favorite so far. hope the next one comes out soon. couldn't put this one down.
1416549447|5.0|I have a few races under my belt but am not exactly a seasoned runner, I found this book to be very helpful in improving my form.  It won't help you immediately get faster, or add miles, and you must train to get the benefits from it.  However, I don't think<br />I would have made the improvements that I did without it.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|Just what I expected, and even slightly more. Almost perfect. Great songs. Huge ballads. What more? [[ASIN:B009A9EQL6 Music from Another Dimension! (Deluxe 2 CD + DVD)]]
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I was loooking for a collection of the sherlock holmes stories and found this for my kindle.  I love sherlock and was thrilled to get the whole collection at such a cheap price, and didn't have to wait to start reading it.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Fun game with many levels, never gets boring, and everyone plays and looks forward to the next challenge. Great game.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|i like that it shows that it is o.k to be upset and everyone makes mistakes.  you have to think before they act
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This app is a great introduction to music using a game format. My daughter has been playing for days now.
B002ZG999U|2.0|I was prepared for this to be terrible, but I wasn't prepared for it to be as boring as it is.  The film is just not interesting in any way.  The characters are not engaged in the action, so there's no reason for the audience to get engaged.<br /><br />It's just so boring listening to these over the hill nimrods acting badly and delivering their lines poorly.  Your time would be better spent watching their other, older movies.  Those movies might be campy and dated, but at least they're trying.  They're just phoning it in for The Expendables.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|I probably would've gone with 31/2 stars if I could.  This was an entertaining action film.  Wife & I both enjoyed it.  It was a little hard to understand all the dialog due to the English accents.  I considered turning on the subtitles or CC, but I don't like to be reading during action movies.
1892005034|5.0|This book is a good starting point to learn what NVC (NonViolent Communication) is all about. Reading it, you will learn that our culture is a \\"Domination System\\", where concepts of right, wrong, good, and evil sabotage our ability to communicate our needs to each other. Our language supports the illusions of \\"enemy images\\", and that the only way to get what we want is to either punish or reward others for their actions. Marshall teaches us how to recognize these pitfalls and traps of our language. He helps us probe and explore the needs behind our language, and then how to translate those needs into words so that others can understand what we need without feeling judged or threatened, or feeling as if demands are being made of them.
0061122416|5.0|I've read this book more than once. It describes persistence/relentlessness, destiny and omens in a very simple and easy way. Buy it, read it, love it....and then buy it again for someone else :)
B006N9XHLQ|3.0|I've enjoyed the Adrien English series, but I'm getting tired of the romance, relationships upstaging the mystery.  I'd also enjoy it more if Mr. Lanyon actually wrote an ending for the books, instead of making the reader read the next book in the series to find out how the characters ended up.
B000XXI8EO|5.0|I have US size 9 feet and got a US size 8 which fit perfectly. These shoes do not require breaking in and are very comfortable right from box. The shape and cut is perfect and the boots are very comfortable to walk in. I recommend this!
B009K72G8I|3.0|i love star wars clone wars. i hat the price for episodes. we are in hard economical times but yet some how digital downloads has continued to rise in price to the point of becoming the same as if you drove your car and purchased it. how sick is that! you dont have a case for it. you dont have previews of up and coming shows on it and yet we have to pay all this bread for it. something has got to give.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Full of surprises, suspenseful and as usual kept me hooked until 1 am. I recommend it to all J G addicts.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is one Christmas movie that is watched every year in our house without fail....and we are all adults now.  It rises above all Christmas Carol movies in my opinion.  This movie has a wonderful soundtrack and the Muppet interaction is fantastic and funny.  Michael Caine is marvelous as Scrooge as are all the human actors...What a total joy this movie is at Christmas for all ages.  You can't miss with this one!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|With an all star cast and non stop action this was a great movie!! I would recommend this movie to any one over 16!!
B001NLJ33K|5.0|Great direction, great soundtrack, great script some acting could use help. Movie is underated beautiful and the epitome of cool!
0547884591|5.0|Really cool book. Totally worth the $20.<br /><br />Tiny little insights like how to shoot a basketball was mindblowingly simple. It has made me go and buy a basketball and practice.<br /><br />Other insights on manners like where to put the bread and drink, as well as fork and spoon/knife, left & right, 4 & 5 letters, was very cool.<br /><br />Haven't read much past the first section because I keep jumping back to fully absorb the material.<br /><br />Give this book a shot even if you aren't that interested in learning to cook, which at the present, I am not.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and good luck to Tim!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|As a huge fan of past series including Sopranos,Twin Peaks,Oz,I have to say this beats them all. OK,maybe ties with OZ.But its funny,horrifying,and touching,all rolled into one great story!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book starts with a questionable premise but step-by-step works through problems in a very believable fashion.<br /><br />Stranded on Mars. You need to survive and travel a long distance for a possible rescue. Oh yeah, you are on an inhospitable planet, too.<br /><br />The book makes you think with a bit of humor added to bring in some fun. Try this book.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Works great, I play it all the time without problems.  I recommend this app if you like to play solitaire.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Had a Kindle got a Lenovo tablet with an Android system, no problem at all, very smooth and quick, very happy
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My son talked me into watching this show and I put it off for a year,  Finally I watched the entire first season and was totally hooked.  The cast of characters are very believable and some you grow to love and others to hate. This current season is packed with suspense and surprises. I thought this show would be a second rate horror series,but it is for those who love drama and great acting.<br /> I am so glad that Amazon offers this to those of us who can't see the TV show due to any reason.  It is well worth the small fee it costs. Very affordable and the quality is first rate.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This movie was fresh and &#34;out of the box&#34;  The whole family enjoyed it, even hubby!  It was well worth the $1.99 rental fee.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|I paid for this and could not watch it the picture was so bad. Try the same movie on VuDu and it was perfect  I will not be wasting my money on your service again. What a rip off.
B007SGM084|3.0|I bought the trilogy, but honestly I've only read the 1st half of the 1st book.  Sure it has some interesting sex in it, but honestly, it's written for a young adult.  I found nothing engaging about the characters.  Don't bother...
B0067RQYNW|5.0|works great. its only a trial, but is very useful. haters of this app suck 8======D and don't know a good app when they see it
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I have seen all of the Stone films and thought that my Mother in Law would also enjoy them so I have purchased the entire series to date for her Christmas gift.

1401307450|5.0|I am a fan of the Chili Peppers but nothing overboard.  I stumbled across the book years back and since I like biographies I decided to give it a try.  Could not have predicted that this would become one of my all time favorites.  So well written, so entertaining, so enjoyable and inspiring to read even though dealing w/ some dark content.  Cannot recommend this book enough.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I just finished \\"The Haunt\\" and I simply loved all the time I spent beating that game.<br /><br />First, I must admit that I needed to review the walk-through at several occasions because I could not solve or puzzle or I missed a clue. But this a reflection of my abilities as a puzzle player, not on the game itself. The puzzles are well thought out and never felt cheap. There are plenty of clues dropped all over the game to help you solve them.<br /><br />The game strongly reminded me of the classic game from the 90's \\"The 7th Guest\\". The game play and the quality of the puzzle is similar except that you tap your kindle fire instead of clicking your screen with a mouse.<br /><br />The visual in this game are simply stunning. The graphics are gorgeous and the music simply haunting. This is definitively one of the best games I played on my kindle fire.<br /><br />The only complain I have is that you cannot zoom on the scene pictures which makes it harder to find the extras like the moths, coins or puzzle pieces.<br /><br />I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a beautiful cerebral game and is tired of slashing the screen and wants to solve a game using deduction and logic.<br /><br />A fantastic game with a great attention to details!

B008D36INE|4.0|Like a lot of people who filed reviews, when I saw this for the first time I had no idea what I was getting into. And it starts sloooooowwwwwlllllyyyy. And darkly. And in a manner that leaves room for confusion. All that said, you'd expect a slamming review. Not so. I couldn't give it five stars simply because of those features that would make it hard for a lot of viewers to get into it. But I gave it four because I watched it all the way through, because it grows in power and it grabs you, and not least because it touched me emotionally in the way that good films will.<br />  The film is simple in concept and quite cliched because it's been done 10 million times in films and theater and books. It's the classic love triangle. Sir William (Simon Russell Beale) loves Hester (Rachel Weisz) who doesn't love him but instead loves dashing Freddie (Tom Huddleston), who enjoys her body but doesn't love her. William is an intelligent, accomplished lawyer and mama's boy who married the well bred and very hot Hester but obviously is not a stud.<br />  Hester, who hates the overbearing mama and lacks any spark at all in her personal relationship with Sir William, falls in love with a flirtatious hot stud fighter pilot Freddie (this is the 1950s in Britain when they were the equivalent of almost forgotten rock stars today). And falls into bed and there are a few nude scenes showing them coiling around each other in bed that explain the immediate physical attraction of both. You can't quite get your head around a mental vision of the older, rotund Sir William doing the nasty with the gorgeous Hester. Which explains why Hester is willing to walk away from a marriage to a man that brought her wealth and security and intellectual companionship for the heady hot love of a younger man.<br />  As has been noted, this is well acted. It's slow and probably a lot -if not a majority - of today's viewers will never appreciate that because they'll never stick around long enough to see the performances - not enough car crashes or exploding buildings or big guns and with the exception of the one bedroom scene- not nearly enough skin. But it is an actor's movie.<br />  Hester could be offsetting. Gorgeous, hot, with a mouth that begs to be explored and eyes you could fall into. Who could feel sorry for that? But you do. Anybody beyond puberty could understand for force that drives her from her physically unappealing husband for the long, lean, lithe, handsome Freddie. Superficial, sure, and you understand that while sex is a big part of the attraction, it's not nearly the whole answer. There's a line later in the film that explains why she falls so hard for Freddie and it's because in the 1950s, Hester has never been with a man that made her realize what true physical and emotional love feels like. And the emotional flows from the physical.<br />  She loves him. Enough to walk away from a man who loves her, has never done anything to deserve her betrayal, who still loves her and maybe always will. But that doesn't overcome the attraction to Freddie. She loves Freddie enough to want him even though she knows he doesn't love her, to degrade herself by begging him to come home, by fighting for just another few hours even knowing it's all ending.<br />  Sir William is an accomplished, intelligent man who loves a woman who he knows he can never hold, can never satisfy,  in the bedroom. All his accomplishments, his power, his wealth, don't matter to a woman obsessed with another man.<br />  And handsome, sexy Freddie is a man lost in yesterday. Like high school athletes whose greatest moments are lived before they turn 20,  for Freddie 1940 and the Battle of Britain in which he and other men saved Britain and maybe the world from the Nazi hordes was the high point of his life. Now he's unemployed, hitting the pubs, enjoying a hot married woman who enjoys him and if she could just accept the fact it's a fling he could be satisfied. But she insists on loving himto the point of trying to commit suicide in despair over the fact that he doesn't love her back. That's a lot of pressure on a guy who just wants to forget his life in her arms.<br />  And because we're obsessed with happy endings, this is the ultimate downer of a movie. Movie's aren't supposed to end this way. Not today. That, more than anything else, explains the dated feel of the film.  What it is - is a tragedy. Where everybody hurts and everybody loses and life just comes along and smacks the hell out of you when you're not expecting it. Which also makes it true to life<br />  All that said, if you've ever loved, deeply, strongly and sadly, this movie will speak to you. Love doesn't always end happily. There are days when I think it almost never does. But I like to think there might be a future for the three hurting people shown in this film. You have to hope so, anyway.to the point of trying to commit suicide in despair over the fact that he doesn't love her back.

0741470314|5.0|Upon the recommendation of my wife, I read Dr. Moriarty's book.  I must admit that I was not a huge MJ fan, although, I had enjoyed some of his music. I found the book to be a passionate account, giving me an insight into the complex life of Michael Jackson, especially the last few years.  I applaud the author's humanistic approach.  I'm not often compelled to write a review or offer an opinion, but in this instance, I applaud Dr. Moriarty's work - a job well done.

0385336691|5.0|I am re-reading The Hard Way for the second time.  It was my first Jack Reacher and I have now read all 17!  My husband and I are hooked on Jack Reacher and I plan to read all of them through again.  I am NOT normally a fan of this genre but these books are outstanding.  I especially like that Lee Child manages to write such great action books without all the bad language -- proving that it really isn't necessary if your writing is good enough!
0470474874|5.0|excellent reference guide.  finding it very useful.  everyone in the dept is using it on and off as necessary.  wonderful book and very well written
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought that it was a fantastic way to follow up the first book, and at the same time, prepare for the final chapter in the story.

B009E3EXMU|5.0|This is an amazing DVD. It has the show plus the entire rehearsal the night/week before which gives you a very personal and different version of the same setlist (they even rehearsed the encore :). You also hear the band through just their stage rigs and not the arena's PA system like you were seeing them in a small club or something. Vintage Zeppelin, Heavy, Avante Garde at times and Spot On! Simply Amazing!
B008MJC6ZS|4.0|Attesting to their durability and talent, has been rocking for decades. DROE delivers what we expect: Speed and heaviness, with vocals that can be understood - Chuck Billy's got a great voice for metal/thrash, and Alex continues to provide metal thrills, trills, and rampage. Every song is a winner.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|having trouble wading though it. it is difficult to follow, just like the movie. not sure what about it is dragging me down. its one of those things where you need to finish the book to appreciate it- or see the movie more than once!

0060786523|3.0|I had a hard time getting through this novel.<br />First it was way too long.  Second, and --that's the main reason--there were too many foreign words to understand.<br />For someone who doesn't speak Hindi and has not sufficient knowledge of India's mufti-cultured society, it will be helpful if the Hindi words were translated into English or explained next to the Hindi.  Relatives, festivals, professions, political structure, societal hierarchy etc. etc all in Hindi.  For the reader it is an interruption of the narrative.  Plus, too much dialogue, some banal or unnecessary.
030758836X|1.0|i am a minority of one.  I found this book full of needless foul language.  However, I will give the author credit for using the F work as 4 different parts of speech.  The plot was improbable and about a 1/3 of the way into the book, I was able to figure out what was going on.  I will avoidMs. Flynn's books in the future.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|So glad to have the Anthology now on Blue Ray.. so brings out the dripping acid & action..Segourney broke out of the mold in these movies to the benefit of other actresses, as capable, brave & tough..well done...Great Amazon Price as Gold Box Selection too..Thankx

1409136612|5.0|This was a quick read, but as always, Maeve Binchy knows how to interweave characters to make them lovable even when they don't start out lovable.  I enjoyed this little story as I have enjoyed every one of her books.  I will miss her books very much.  She is an ultimate story teller.
B005IS565S|5.0|This cd is everything I thought it would be. Every song is just tremendous with Death Punch attitude. It is one of those cd's you put in you cd player and hit play. No searching for for just two or three songs you like because every song is great.
B005HI4LMS|4.0|Great movie to watch and kept me laughing the whole time. Grab some friends, snacks and sit down for a good night of laughs with this one.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|OK, so I'm a 50+ fan of the twilight saga.  Yes, the books were better, but the movie was pretty good also.  I just hope she writes more books!

0316212377|3.0|Banks may be one of the most ambitious writers in SF right now, tackling subtle themes and taking large risks. You've got to give him props for his reach, even if his grasp sometimes falls short--as it does in The Hydrogen Sonata.<br /><br />Shakespeare wrote, \\"There's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we may.\\" The theme of the novel is manipulation. People and events are manipulated on multiple levels. The question is whether or not they can realize the manipulation and transcend it.<br /><br />The Gzilt are a race that's as old as The Culture; in fact, they helped found The Culture but decided at the last minute not to join it. (Or, perhaps, they were refused admission.) Now they are preparing to take the next evolutionary step: Subliming. The events of the novel take place in the final days before the Gzilt move on and leave this plane of existence. The question that propels the plot is whether the Gzilt religion (famous throughout the galaxy as the only one built on truth) was actually the result of manipulation by another, older, race. If the Gzilt were manipulated, will it affect their decision to Sublime? If The Culture learns the truth about the beginning of the Gzilt religion, should the Gzilt be told? Ultimately, though, the answers to those question are not especially important, because there's so many other instances of manipulation going on.<br /><br />The problem with the story is that the characters' motivations seem weak. The antagonist--the master manipulator, if you will--seems driven by the thought of how his name will be remembered by posterity. Considering that he and the vast majority of his entire race are just days away from leaving this plane of existence for a higher--and to us, incomprehensible--existence, this seems kind of Ozymandias-like stupid. I'd like to think a being, who has risen to the near-top of his ancient and complex race, who's just days away from Subliming, might aim a little higher, or be more informed by the lessons of history. But in any case, that seems to be his motivation for manipulating his entire race, and for killing many others. It didn't work for me.<br /><br />Similarly, the motivations for some of the other characters--mostly in the higher echelons of the Gzilt military--were never explained to my satisfaction. (I could write another couple of paragraphs about how the Gzilt are organized into a military culture but, ostensibly, aren't an especially violent race. Banks shows us that cultural lie as the plot unfolds.)<br /><br />Banks' universe is a huge, sprawling, place; he shows us his universe through what is essentially a travelogue or series of scenes set in different locations. Truly, he is a master world-builder and it is in his diversity of vision that his mastery manifests itself. But even there, sometimes the scenery overwhelms the weak plot and weak character motivations, leaving us with pretty pictures deviod of much meaning.<br /><br />There are no real heroes in this story. The ostensible protagonist is literally being carried along for the ride. Another Special Circumstances agent is woken from her suspended animation, has a mini-travelogue adventure to learn some facts, and then is returned back to sleep, without a single change in her character. If anything, it is the Culture ships, and their avatars, who are featured and who move the plot along. At this point, I feel as though Banks has grown weary of writing about humans and human analogs. I feel he's much more comfortable writing about his Culture ships, with their in-joke names and their ship-to-ship dialog, laced with barbed irony.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I've read almost all of Banks' SF works and will undoubtedly continue to buy them as fast as he writes them. But I'd like to see him imbue some hope and heroism into his \\"human\\" characters, if only so that I don't feel so disconnected from the characters the next time I read a Culture novel.the lessons of history.

B009157BWU|5.0|I first saw Chimpanzee on a long overseas flight.  This short movie, narrated by Tim Allen, about the life of a little chimp named Oscar and his clan, was very sweet and moving.  I actually decided to rent it here on Amazon so I could watch it again, this time with my family.  It's a great family movie, not too long, and you learn a lot about the life of a chimpanzee!  ALSO, I am NOT the type of person who ever watches nature shows, nature movies, or National Geographic, but I still found this movie very engaging and was able to stick with it the whole time...even wanting to see it again :)

0316228532|4.0|There are many things JK Rowling is good at but I think one of the best is how she writes teenagers. She did it well in Harry Potter and she's done it again here, though here the teenagers are a little less magical and a lot more realistic and sometimes dark.<br /><br />When I started reading this book, I have to say I found it tedious. It was a slow start, with many households and characters to introduce and the idea of anything council or a little bit political makes me switch off very quickly. But I owed it JK Rowling to see it through and after about 100 pages, certain characters and situations started to entertain me. As the story progressed it got more interesting. My nitpicks were the slow start and the amount of characters to remember. There are 6 families and every family has at least three people in it, and all interconnect in one way or another in this small town. It was hard to remember who was who, especially with names like Simon and Colin, Terri and Tessa.<br /><br />On the whole though, once I could get a grasp on the characters and who belonged where (I should have drawn a wee diagram) it was good. It was a raw telling of people at their worst and sometimes best.<br />I'm glad I read it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I've used this application before and I still love it! It is simple but yet perfect for what I like!
B001ED7C58|5.0|The best cd ever compared to the Breaking Dawn Part 2 soundtrack and score. This soundtrack is very enjoyable and brings back memories from 2008.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I don't like that I can only see few things on my News Feed. It only shows like 5 stories and that's it! And there is no way I can check the other ones

B006LSZECO|2.0|It took a lot of reading for me to get interested, the writing is boring and the end is even worse.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've heard about this game a lot and I never gave the big step and downloaded it. Until now. I seriously can't stop playing. It's so good and fun!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I think its a great app because u can look up what u want and it pops up right then and there this app is awesome I reckamend this

B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this game about two weeks ago and I have played nothing else since.  I am totally addicted to this solitaire game!  It is so easy and fun!
B005CM9DX6|4.0|I remember reading that this was a divisive album before hearing, but wow, just looking through these previous comments really confirms it. I think Im a pretty level headed fan of music and not a black or white, all or nothing superfan who wants a band to stick with one sound only. That being said, this album is pretty good. Not great, but pretty good.<br /><br />If all Opeths albums where 9s or 10s, this is a solid 8. If you come to Opeth for their aggressiveness you will understandably not like this, but if you come to Opeth for their creativity, musicianship and boldness, PLUS if you are familiar with the works of bands like King Crimson, then you will find a lot to enjoy with this album.<br /><br />Opeth has 9 fantastic albums under their belts, you cant expect them to keep making the same thing over and over. I personally love it when a band walks away from their established sound to try something new (see Adore by SP), and thats whats happening here. Yes a couple tracks cover a bit TOO much ground to the point of sounding unfocused, but thats my only real problem with the album.<br /><br />This album reminds me a lot of 'Starless and Bible Black' by King Crimson, so if you like that style, then approach this with an open mind and most importantly, give it several spins before making up your mind, because like all Opeth albums, its incredibly deep and rewarding. I think that the creative contingent of Opeths fanbase will find a lot to like here.
B003KK6GJQ|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is about sisterhood, choices and the sacrifices we all have to make in life. Should it be us or our parents who have the right to decide what's best for us? This book will keep your interest to the last page. It's also an emotional roller coaster with characters that are not very likeable. It's real.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|Loved the movie and the soundtrack is awesome. If you like musicals you'll love this movie and soundtrack. Listen to it all the time!
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Perhaps I expected too much because it was such an original (and exciting) idea, but the final product left me feeling kind of disappointed.  Some of the writing was okay, yet the plot as a whole made me feel as if I'd seen this before -- very stale and/or stupid (Vampires on the field at Gettysburg?  Really?).  My biggest problem with this movie was the special effects -- there was too much of them!  This movie would have worked much better as something dark and gritty, but this movie was way too overboard.  In short, it was an FX spectacle... many of which were of eye-rollingly poor quality.  The best FX are the ones you never see, but I guess nobody ever told this to the director.  This makes me think Timur was a poor choice for this project.  I know &#34;Wanted&#34; was cool, and he has done other things I liked.. Just not this one, particularly.  This was far too stylized and slick, with perfect, digitally-added blood splatters that felt wrong every time I saw them.  I suppose the concept was to turn a potentially dark Thriller into a bad Matrix clone.  Not awful, the idea alone is interesting enough for a view, but not great either.  This movie left me wanting much more from my Alternate History flick.
B0086700CM|5.0|it was so fun on the phone but it was so small so I got it for my little girl to play with it was bigger than a phone.
0452289963|5.0|This is one of the Best self-help books I have ever read.  Was so glad to receive it in time for the televised class with Eckhart and Oprah.
0786955570|5.0|Great game that plays well enough like 4th edition.  Very suspenseful, and NEVER the same game twice! Grab some friends and dive into Ravenloft!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|As an avid fan of &#34;Phantom&#34; - seeing the performance live numerous times, I would rate this as a fantastic viewing experience.  If you have never seen the production live, or if you are just missing your experiences of seeing &#34;Phantom&#34; live...you will not be disappointed.  In fact, you'll be delighted!  Sierra Boggess steals the show as a perfect 'Christine.'
0786956291|5.0|Great for someone just getting into 4th Edition, or new to the game of D&D entirely. Presents the rules in an easy to ready format along with the prepared adventure.  Great starting point for anyone!
0345803507|1.0|The author was genius in waiting to publish until all three books were written. By the time the reader gets half-way through the first book and realizes how repetitive the book reads, many people like me who bought all three books, have already spent the money, making E.L. James a millionaire and wasting their time and money. I'm no prude but have read more titillating and less boring books. Seller not responsible for content and was prompt about shipping and books arrived in perfect condition
B009XY97VC|4.0|I have not listened to it enough to judge whether I will rank it up there with TSFH's previous works but I do like it.  It is interesting that there are lyrics that you can actually understand on two of the songs.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Would never stay on my head, but they lasted a long time. I just wore a hat with them or used bobby pins to pin them to my head.
0385344333|2.0|I am a true Lee Child fan and have read every Jack Reacher book. Like all other Lee Child fans I eagerly anticipated the arrival of \\"A Wanted Man.\\" How terribly disappointed I was with it. I cannot recommend this book be purchased as it does not come anywhere close to other Jack Reacher novels. Is Lee Child losing his touch or taking advantage of his legions of loyal Reacher fans to make lots of money. Somehow, he approved Tom Cruise as Reacher for the forthcoming movie. I am sure the dollars involved helped.<br /><br />I hope the next Jack Reacher novel is one worth buying and reading. This one is not.
B007M45PMU|3.0|I love the songs in the beginning of the CD. And I love their hit single &#34;Ho Hey&#34; but a lot of the tracks after that are kind of forgettable to me.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|I was looking for a solution for my Samsung Galaxy Nexus device to steady it for shooting fireworks at night.  It is cheaply built - but more important, a decent sized phone doesn't fit in the holder.  Save your cash and find another solution because unleess you have an older iPhone?  You're probably out of luck.
B002GJI8PM|5.0|It is wonderful to hear the soundtrak...the movie is wonderful but the music is just as wonderful to enjoy itself.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Even though I don't care for Tom Cruise I love musicals and enjoyed this on.  Love the great songs and story was cute.
B002UTKSBK|5.0|We are enjoying the soundtracks very much.  It is nice to enjoy the wonderufl music and sound that made this music so memorable.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Who doesn't love the lion King? This is a another product I got when expected and arrived in great condition! I was excited to sit down with the kids and watch it with them! Another great product :)
B0063IH60K|3.0|I cannot see why I would use this game much, since solitare is a waste of time in a busy day. But this version IS well designed.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|This was the only Movie I was missing for the full set, so I couldn't be happier. It arrived when expected in fine condition! Once again no complaints. Happy customer :)
034580404X|5.0|It is a great erotic novel, it takes you to another place...love it! Also it was great buying the trilogy!
0547884591|5.0|I just finished the 4-Hour Chef. 3 sittings, cover to cover.  Tried a few suggestions for learning and cooking with great success. I've read Tim's other books and this one fits right into the set. Tim is a great aggregator of ideas and presents them clear and in context. I love how he truly mixes different subject matter domains under a single title. Inspired us to get doing! I'm looking forward to his next book! suggesting a \\"better parenting\\" or even a \\"DIY/maker/craft/renovation\\" book. :)
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this version of solitaire.  I especially like the ability to pick winning hands.  It deals well and the layout allows for bigger cards.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I enjoy David Baldacci's work as I like escapist spy stories. The Camel Club is the name of a group of friends who investigate incidents of national security that they become aware of.  They use their multiple skill sets and past experiences to solve strange happenings. This one begins with the accidental discovery of a body by the members of the club and the subsequent life and death adventures they get into as they race to solve the crime, save their loved ones and dismantle the larger terrorist plot.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a great book. I have been lifting for about 3 years straight varying between arnold inspired body building workouts and westside barbell powerlifting style. on my own i lifted hard and worked my way down from about 200 lbs to 170 lbs, but i could never gain weight the right way and get the definition i wanted. I have been following Bigger leaner stronger methods about 3 weeks now (and not perfectly yet as i havent been portioning my food exactly yet) and i have gained about 7 lbs in 3 weeks. The biggest thing for us guys to understand is we arent professional lifters and we cant train like them, thats why our results are hindered. Michael Matthews addresses this and explains the proper training methods for us non professionals to do to attain our best gains. I am making the best gains of my life and this book helped me all the way
0061537969|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost a pet that they think of as family.  You will laugh, you will cry, but most of all you will feel good.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is not as complex a story as Pillars of the Earth or World Without End, but is an excellent continuation of Fall of Giants. The history is well documented and the character development and their intertwined lives makes the story interesting. It also provides insights into the terror and tragedy of Nazi torture and killing of Jews and others as well as the spying and horrors of the Soviet Union. It is also insightful on how some German people took tremendous personal risks to stopped the Nazi regime. I look forward to the final book in this trilogy.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found this novel to be very complex, hard to follow. The ending did not satisfy my need for an ending with the love triangle.
0817439390|3.0|The vocabulary and terminology used in this book are above my level of knowledge in the photography field.  Perhaps with more practice and experience, and more reading in other venues, I'll be able to process and utilize the information presented in this book.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Just as described and beautifully packaged. The sets and costumes are amazing. Also, entertaining to watch and to try and spot the historical differences.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I guess maybe I just expected something more.<br />The socio political commentary is mostly well done but on some points seems dated.
B007MDB71O|5.0|So sad this movie didn't do better at the box office! It is really beautifully done. Excellent cast, acting, dialogue, story and great special effects. I'm old enough to remember when the paperbacks and artwork for John Carter, Dejah Thoris, Tars Tarkas, etc, looked very cool to me. All of the actors did great jobs with their parts. I was especially effected by the beautiful Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris. I found myself thinking, \\"all the actors were great in this movie, but how did they get an ACTUAL princess of Mars down here to Earth to star in one of our films? Hah! Anyway, this movie deserved much better success in theaters and to call it a dud just seems like complete nonsense to me.<br /><br />I would say that choosing the name \\"John Carter\\" instead of \\"John Carter of Mars\\" was a mistake (though I can think of a couple reasons why they might have done that), and my recollection of the marketing for the film seemed sort of weak or unfocused. Beyond that, I'm sort of at a loss at the failure of the film to do well. Just bad luck for everyone involved in its making. I sure hope Disney continues with this series.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Johnny Depp seems to either hit or miss with his movies (in my opinion). This is more like a foul ball that was almost a hit. It could have been better, but thankfully it wasn't worse.<br />It has it's funny moments, serious but not dramatic scenes, then I'm not sure if overly dramatically or just poorly written and directed moments.<br />My wife and I rented it and are glad we did, but are happy we didn't buy it.
B005LAIGWS|4.0|This movie was closer to the comics than the first. It used the visual `style' from the comics, and totally incorporates it into the movie. Think Sin City..... People criticized Nicholas Cage, but he really portrayed the insanity of the Ghost Rider, and the panic instilled in the comic book character. The Ghost Rider special effects are even better in this movie.<br /><br />Ciar'an Hines is excellent as Roarke (the Devil on Earth).<br /><br />Best scenes...the Ghost Rider taking over the gigantic Digger Machine...AWESOME! Johnny Whitworth (Carrigan) reborn by the Devil into a creature of decay. Everything he touches, peole, sandwiches, an apple, all rots and decays in his hands. Until he grabs a Twinkie, and nothing happens. Cracked me up. And Whitworth . is even better after he becomes The Decayer<br /><br />Other nice move was Christopher Lambert as the Order Priest. Perfect casting, even it was for one minute. I man, how cool is it to have The Highlander do a cameo?<br /><br />As to the plot, the Ghost Rider ends up being the protector of Nadya and her son, who just happens to be the mother of the Son of Satan, Danny (Fergus Riordan). There is a lot of The Terminator 2 in the story. Do not judge this flick until you've seen it. Again, it is a better rendition of the Comic Book than the you think.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love watching the full episodes that were intended for viewing - not the shortened USA episodes... Perfect buy for DA fans!

B009YU62H2|4.0|You wouldn't know it was their first album in sixteen years. King Animal delivers the familiar sound you expect from Soundgarden. I especially like \\"Taree,\\" \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\" and \\"Rowing.\\" It's a genuine rock album.

B006Y5H74W|5.0|I love that this musical has a plot to it unlike Glee. Kathryn McVee is outstanding as both an actress and a singer. Who knew? She is worth investing time in alone but the other characters are rich as well.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I have not played this game.  It was purchased for grandsons because it was something they wanted when I visited them in the fall.  It does however, look very interesting and certainly better then all the video games they play.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Detective Harry Bosch stories are simply the best. If you love walking thru the minds of a good detective then Harry is your best.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|Ordered the product along with a pair of wireless headphones.  Paired immediately with headphones but the ipod basically had to have line of sight with the headset to work within 3-5 too; 30 feet distance, not even close. Put the ipod on your belt, lose connection. Thought maybe it was my headphones so I paired with my EVO. Worked flawlessly at gym this morning so it is the bluetooth adapter that is issue. Returning today and will try another brand.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Love this movie. I also received it before it was expected. Can not wait to sit and watch it again like it was the first time
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is the most incredible book I've ever read.  How anyone could have survived what Marcus did is absolutely beyond anyone's imagination. I've actually had the honor and pleasure of meeting this brave soldier and am proud that I was able to tell him in person how much my family and I appreciate the sacrifices him and his fallen SEAL Team members have made for our country.  I would highly recommend this book to everyone that would like to read a true account of what these men go through.
B0053O89IS|5.0|My daughter and I love Criminal Minds.  She is collecting all seasons, as it is one of her favorite TV show.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Only thing bad about this is the earphones go out really quick but they did last about 4 months. The mic is crisp and clear and doesn't pick up music so it doesn't annoy the crap out of the other players.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter, but I have read these books!  They are totally awesome!  They are very entertaining!
B000YHG72E|4.0|This is a Christmas movie that everyone in our family enjoys. It is clean enough for our five-year-old to watch and he loves it!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|It's nice to be able to get radio station that I would never be able to listen to otherwise. Works fairly well.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|To anyone buying the version of the Blu-ray that comes with the digital copy, please be advised that you will only be able to get the Ultra Violet version and not the file from iTunes. For some reason this is advertised as saying that it comes with both, but when I tried to redeem the iTunes version it said it wasn't available in the US.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book is well written and grabs you.  Easy to follow although the setting is in England.  Still consider it as a \\"must read!\\" As you get nearer to the end, it is harder to put down!!
B004V5A7K8|4.0|Brings back fond memories of the original video game.  It runs fine on an android tablets (Ice Cream Sandwich) but sometimes it hangs.  I may be the operating systems fault.  Recommened
B00371XIP8|5.0|I've always loved these movies. It's an action packed and it doesn't hurt that the brothers are good looking with great bodies.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|I love the writer's style and content.  I will look for another Michael Pollan book when I finish this one.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|This was a very good movie the sound and colors were great storyline starting to get a little old but watch the latest series.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Gripping read that keeps your attention. Some of the main characters are placed in contrived situations as they always seem to be in the middle of historical events like Forrest Gump, but I suppose some of that is necessary in order to move the plot forward.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Hard to believe the man who sang &#34;Maggie May&#34; is now singing christmas songs.  I bought without really checking it out and when i received it was surprised to find him doing some duets.  One with Michael Buble.  I don't know if it's just me, but sometimes when Rod Stewart sings he sounds like &#34;Mr Herbert&#34; from &#34;Family Guy&#34;.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|the game is so fun I played it on Wwii and.computer i was waiting for the game when I heard it was coming out
B00186LO00|5.0|What can I say, you either like Southpark or don't.  I love it.  The writers invented very funny characters and very funny stories.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|Setup was easy, though it irked me you were forced to install iTunes to use the software. Generally speaking, the software is good at separating songs on an LP, but if there are very quiet moments in a song it can split songs unexpectedly (but nothing you couldn't fix with Audacity freeware). My pet peeve with that is when you finish one side of the record and it has six songs on it, the software will come up with six fields for the song names, but only one for album and artist, so if it is a compilation album you will have to go back in and fix artist names later on your files (or record one song at a time, also a hassle) It does not show the time for any of the songs, so if it unexpectedly split in seven sections, you don't know on which song it happened. The sound quality is ok, not great. Overall it's an easy and relatively inexpensive way to turn the old record trove into mp3's and fun to listen to forgotten songs, but if you really love an album you may want to just buy the commercial cd if it's available.

038572179X|5.0|McEwan's England of the turn-of-the-twentieth-century is so superbly realized, it makes it possible, after immersing oneself in the novel, to see whereever-it-is-you-are, now, the reader, more clearly.<br /><br />Lofty claim, you say?  Well, it doesn't stop there:<br /><br />- this novel evidences \\"why\\" we die (through the figure of Briony, at life's end, in the \\"Epilogue\\" of the novel; not that she has a \\"gentle into that good night\\" awaiting her, no, not hardly -- but everyone's DEAD, London's WAY different, WHERE is there to go, really?  Things have been \\"exhausted,\\" in more ways than one ... )<br /><br />- having read it twice in two years (spontaneously -- which might sound redundant to point out, but, how often do you hear THAT?), and tried, as hard as I might, to delineate whose \\"fault\\" it is -- tracing the \\"fault lines\\" to try to find the \\"nodal point\\" for the central tragedy, the door swung open, the flip switch that, yes, would mean, sorry to say, YOU did it, pal -- I found myself cleverly outwitted by McEwan's narrative strategy, nay, his very INSISTENCE, that all of the \\"tripwires\\" are simply the result of the war, industrialized and immense, coming in, too soon, too fast, for anyone to see coming and adjust to!  (Unfortunately, of course, this \\"no-fault\\" zone-shifting makes it all the harder for people to claim back what they did/didn't do: hence Briony's pursuit of the \\"Atonement\\" of the title, done in spite the darkening shadow(s) blotting out humanity's - and, thus Humanity's -- immediate reach ...)<br /><br />- the \\"semi-psychosis\\" Robbie Turner has to result to (after the offhand psychic trauma at the beginning of Part II, witnessing the banality of a child's severed limb nestled in the crook of a tree branch) is one of the most successful interior limnings of such distress I've come across, outside of John Shirley's and William S. Burroughs's fiction (\\"o.k., save the woman because you can ... wait, you could get YOURSELF killed ... wait, rely on your two friends ... wait, THEIR judgment's not so good!\\", etc.): a sort of don't-look-down psychic \\"tightrope-walking,\\" in which the losses at stake are both the loss of the \\"self\\" and of one's physical life, both needing, absurdly, insanely, regardless, to be managed & preserved in awkward tandem throughout the march to the beach and, thereafter, Cecilia  ...<br /><br />IN SUM:  You're better off if you buy this & read this as soon as you can, toting it around with you, in your day-to-day.  Leave the driving to McEwan: he won't let you down, until the ride's over, until it's time to get off, and then, you'll be changed -- your worldview & empathetic range \\"expanded\\" -- for good!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />[TRAILER:]<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Above all, she wanted to look as though she<br />hadn't given the matter a moment's thought, and<br />that would take time.<br /><br />- [Cecilia], p. 123<br /><br />Which way?

It was the sound of panic itself, mounting and<br />straining toward the extinction they all knew, indiv-<br />idually, to be theirs.  It was a sound you were obliged<br />to take personally.  Turner guided the woman through<br />the gate.  He wanted her to run with him into the cen-<br />ter of the field.  He had touched her, and made her<br />decision for her, so he felt he could not abandon her.<br />But the boy was at least six years old and heavy, and<br />together they were making no progress at all.<br /><br />He dragged the child from her arms.  \\"Come on,\\" he<br />shouted.<br /><br />A Stuka carried a singlethousand-pound bomb.

B0087ITC9C|5.0|Great film...the in-flight soundtrack is excellent...opening scene gives us a glimpse of the main character's distored life waking up from a hang-over. The two time Oscar winner may earn a nomination, but he will not win because of that (go ask De Niro). A much better performance in 'Flight' (character driven) compared to 'Training Day' for example according to critics (several years ago) they compared Russell Crowe's performance in 'Gladiator' to 'A Beautiful Mind' and it was said Crowe should've won for 'Mind' instead of 'Gladiator'. The same could said here...supporting cast are excellent - John Goodman is a cross between \\"The Dude\\" and a RET. hippie from Woodstock. Don Cheadle plays a no-nonsense attorney. Zemeckis may have earned himself atleast another Best director nomination...will he win? - well he has already won with this movie.

It's particularly good for those who are on a constant quest on how to improve one's life. With the four easy steps, some more challenging than others, it's well worth trying and having in one's library.

B002U6CJCE|4.0|I never saw the original ones but this one was good action packed. Good to see Van Damme coming out with many movie lately.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I love reading the thrillers gendre and I watch too many crime shows on TV, so hence I thought this plot was a little drawn out and predictable.  Dont get me wrong, there were moments where I was caught in the description, but the plot left me with 'ooh, it is a who's done it' and the outcome once revealed, the rest was tedious and the ending was weak.<br /><br />I just think in part 3 of the book - it was in crazy land and no normal person would stay unless they are equally mentally ill and it just didnt seem to fit the character than was in part 1 and 2 of the novel.  Sometimes, you can try to be too clever and it is hard to unravel and connect the dots to make sense of it all.

B00338QENI|5.0|This is a wonderfully well written book that is a mixture of biology, medical ethics, and a biography about a woman named Henrietta Lacks whose tumor cells (HeLa) were taken w/o her consent that became immortal.  These cells have been used to help cure and/or create treatments for many of the illnesses that have plagued man-kind for centuries.  However, who was the woman behind these cells?  Is it okay to just take someone's tissue without their knowledge? Is it okay to make a profit off of it? Is this tissue still considered to be property of the individual once it leaves the body?  Rebecca Skloot discusses these questions and more in this amazing book.  I can't put it down! Highly recommended!

B007MNV5WU|2.0|I purchased this for my daughter to play. Luckily, my wife likes it too. The game works OK by her estimate, with a huge caveat. During game play, you get certain credits for various things. The conditioning is to click the credit counter (I think it is eagles in this game) to play through the level. At some point, when you have no &#34;credits&#34; left, a pop up offers more. If you are too quick on the trigger (maybe based on the conditioning), you will PURCHASE credits. OK, everyone needs to make a buck, so if it were a free game -- live with it. Not so much if I paid for the game. Some things you can't get to without spending additional money. Adults can make their own call on this, just be aware that your child may be racking up charges on your credit card, depending on how you set up the account.
B009YU62H2|5.0|I love me some SG, but I can't say I've always dug them. Hardcore SG fans would probably hate me because I like their mid-to-late 90s stuff.<br /><br />I had some reservations about this album and about them reuniting. But I had to get this.<br /><br />Started out just okay to me. I ended up sort of doing something else, not paying strict attention. Then A Thousand Days Before came on. &#34;Alright.&#34; Valley Floor: &#34;Now we're talkin'&#34; Then Bones of Birds came on and I was all in. I listened to nothing else for about 3 days.<br /><br />I can't recommend this to all hardcore SG fans, but I really like this a lot. Very much follows the lead of Down On The Upside, which I loved.
B008NB0SQO|2.0|I can not believe the stupidity of Disney in cutting Whan Love Is Gone from this otherwise great movie.  I own every previous version of this movie and it was irritating that my family could not watch the movie in wide screen with the full content of the standard version.  I had been waiting to buy the Blu-Ray version knowing they couldn't possibly make this mistake again.  Well I guess I should have known watching Disney's actions of the recent past that they would fail once again.<br /><br />In my case the butchering of the movie means though I have bought all the other versions I will pass on this one.  It's a shame that they have blown it again.  If they ever put the movie back together in Blu-Ray I will purchase it, but until then I will put up with the butchered wide screen DVD that I already own.
B009MF56GC|3.0|it's not bad. best thing is the violence. disapointed at the picture though ..too grainny in too many parts. that's a turnoff. wouldn't buy again
B0053O89Z6|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!  I haven't watched all the episodes yet, but the cast of characters are great. People in their 20's and 30's (maybe even 40's and 50's!  sorry, nothing but love) can definitely related to a number of things discussed on this show.

The quality on the kindle fire is excellent - I don't know if I'd call it HD, but it's good quality.  Very good purchase for 2.99!

B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Take's one back to the old Rebus days.  In some ways not so dark as the older Rebus books where he got entrenched in Edinburgh's suburban slum life, but Scotland's gangster underworld still plays a big part. Bit of a fresh breath getting up north for a lot of the well-crafted story.  Kind of fun to browse Google maps/ street view as you follow the peregrinations. My only complaint - finished it too quickly!  Better read it again.
B009KYXEY6|1.0|I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend that LOVES Lana Del Rey. He already owned &#34;BornTo Die&#34; but when I saw that there were three additional tracks on this &#34;Born To Die&#34; disc I bought this CD instead of just the &#34;Paradise&#34; CD.  Well, the joke was on me because there are not three additional tracks even though they are listed on the back of the CD. I could have just bought the &#34;Paradise&#34; CD and saved the additional money. Shame on them for advertising songs that are not there!

I don't stress myself out to make it in time to watch it when it airs because I thought that I could come here immediately after and watch it!

B005PWPUW6|5.0|First, some of the stock images are outdated.  The model I got (From Amazing Deals Online) also has a Line Out for headphones in addition to the RCA plugs even though that is not listed in the specs for this cheaper model.  As far as I can tell you get the exact same unit here as you do in that other thread (http://www.amazon.com/D3-Digital-Converter-Optical-Toslink/dp/B005K2TXMO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354035488&sr=8-1&keywords=dac) it just doesn't come with an optical cable which I didn't need.  The toggle for optical/coax has been moved and is now a slider on the back of the device.  If you look through the images here and in the other FiiO D3 thread that comes with an optical cable (http://www.amazon.com/D3-Digital-Converter-Optical-Toslink/dp/B005K2TXMO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354035488&sr=8-1&keywords=dac) you will see some of the updated images that don't have that metal toggle switch.<br /><br />I am using this with a very inexpensive Emerson TV (LC391EM3) I got at Walmart.  It only has a Coax out for audio (and headphone out which I don't like to use because then you have to use the TV volume).  The receiver I have is an older Sony STR-D350Z from the 90's which doesn't have optical/coax audio inputs.  I am using this to watch cable TV from a comcast pace high definition cable box using HDMI in to my TV and coax out to this FiiO D3 which then goes out to my receiver via stereo RCA.<br /><br />I am also using this with my new Nintendo Wii U.  That is also going HDMI in to my TV, out to the FiiO D3 and then out via stereo RCA to the receiver.<br /><br />***Remember to set your cable box or any component like a Blu-ray player to output L-PCM or PCM or you will not get audio as this FiiO D3 cannot decode Dolby or DTS.  Most equipment allows you to change the output type or will default to L-PCM or PCM like the Nintendo Wii U.<br /><br />This thing works perfectly for me.  There is no hum or hiss at all no matter which pieces of equipment are on or off.  I cannot even tell I have the thing installed.<br /><br />I am powering the FiiO D3 using the USB port on my TV so I don't have to take up an outlet for the plug which is really nice.  The FiiO D3 comes with a usb cable and wall adapter which makes me think they had this sort of setup in mind when they designed it for people who have a USB connection.  I used sticky backed velcro to mount the unit to the back of my TV and cable ties to clean up the cables so it looks very professional.<br /><br />I am more than happy with this unit.  It keeps me from having to use the headphone jack on my TV to my receiver which is a pain because then you have to set your TV volume correctly.  Using the Coax out means I can mute the speakers on my TV and not have to worry about the volume of my TV at all and can control the volume strictly from my receiver.  I'll take a picture and add it to the customer pictures to show how I installed it.even tell I have the thing installed.<br /><br />I am powering the FiiO D3 using the USB port on my TV so I don't have to take up an outlet for the plug which is really nice.

0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef again demonstrates, as did his previous books 4-Hour Life and 4-Hour Body, that Tim Ferriss is a master of quickly grasping the macro view of any subject and using that to identify the most efficient and effective micro steps to learn the subject quickly and easily. His approach is creative and ingenious, and this book contains many, many examples of how he has used it to learn seemingly disparate subjects to a high level.<br /><br />The most fascinating part of the book to me is an inside view on how Ferriss thinks. He is definitely outside the box, and makes it clear why that is necessary and useful if you want to exercise control over your own life. His message is clear--anyone can learn to learn anything. Mastering learning is the first step to get the skills and expertise you want, to work how/when/where you want, and--in short--to live as you want.<br /><br />At first I thought the book was a little disjointed, because so many subject areas are introduced. Cooking is just one part of it. However, once I began to take more of a macro view myself, I realized that each subject example demonstrates variations on how to apply the learning techniques the book is trying to teach. Working at the macro level takes a lot more mental energy than operating on the mundane day-to-day level. It's something many of us are not used to doing. Seeing the big picture is something formal education rarely teaches (or even encourages) us to do. Ferriss, in my opinion, is exceptional for having achieved that style of thinking, largely on his own.<br /><br />Overall, I was fascinated and delighted with the book, and highly recommend it for people who want to learn how to get out of the box, too, in their own way, and create a self-designed, intentional life. The book is worth some serious study, in my opinion.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Orphan is one of the films that really surprise you. I thought the storyline was original and the acting is flawless especially Vera Farmiga and newcomer Isabelle Fuhrman who plays the creepy, sinister Esther. I knew there would probably be a twist ending, and there is but I didn't expect the truth about Esther to be so twisted! I throughly enjoyed this thriller, I highly recommend it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a wonderful overview of the Civil  War and the events that led up to it as well as an indepth look at Lincoln and the members of his cabinet. It led me to also buy a new bio. of Seward. I highly recommend this book.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I love this! I got chills when I heard the songs in the movie. Having them in my personal collection is total ear candy!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Very challenging and fun to play once you start its hard to stop. Plus you can't beat the price. Graphics are awesome too.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|While this flick didn't really surprise me, it did it's job.  Yep.  That was a guy who looked like Honest Abe, and he did kill the undead with his axe in some pretty nifty ways.  But the &#34;emotional&#34; moments of the film felt out of place, the belly laughs that are inherent to this kind of campy thrill-ride were too few... and don't get me started on the whole Mary Todd courtship.  Eeesh... awkward.  Those factors coupled with some occasionally ragtag CGI made watching Abe a bit off-putting at times.<br /><br />Still... overall, it was good-not-great, with some visual appeal and creative violence occasionally bogged down in it's need to tie in historical moments of Lincoln's life.  While it might be fun to watch with friends and crack a few jokes to, don't make the mistake we did and have it follow 'Cabin In The Woods', which does a much better job at blending humor and gory mayhem.<br /><br />As far as the actual product is concerned, the DVD is pretty standard fare.  It offers a little documentary about bringing the book to the screen as well as audio commentary if those things interest you.  Nothing terribly special really.  It was delivered quickly and in excellent condition for a reasonable price... so there's that.<br /><br />3 stars for this odd blend of genres, atmospheres, history and mayhem.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've not read a &#34;murder mystery&#34; for years, thinking them too formulaic or obvious. but this book took control and wouldn't let me put it down. Chock full of good, black humor and VERY well-developed characters. Amy and Nick's marriage defines &#34;dysfunctional&#34;. Especially recommend for all you married folks....
B004HGBUR0|4.0|One of Trail of Dead's best records!! Great record to begin with if you are just discovering them. The packaging for this album is awesome!
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Love the style of how it is written - as a reader you get the chance to understand each character's perspective. Great images of India!
B00138KLDY|5.0|This definitely is the Essential Bruce Springsteen set to have!  Has all the songs you are looking for as well as some ones from the vault!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love it it is fun but at the same time it is addictive! you just want to play it all the time
B004A2U4V4|5.0|This definitely is the Ultimate Collection, has all the classic hits you expect, plus a few newer hits as well!  Definitely worth every Penny!
6301449142|4.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE, HOWEVER THE COLORIZATION PROCESS WAS NOT THAT GREAT...BUT THIS MOVIE IS STILL ONE OF MY FAVORITES...
B0083GCK5G|4.0|Definitely not a bad CD, definitely on the slower side, but the harmonies are still great!  Definitely a must have if you are a Beach Boys Fan!
0307463745|3.0|I've already forgotten who recommended Rework to me even though it was only a week or so ago. But something about the recommendation must have made an impression, because I made sure to get a copy as soon as I could. A week later I brought it home, and read it in about an hour. It's that fast. Rework is in-your-face, two-page chapter advice on what to do and not do when starting and running a company. How to stay small, be profitable, and enjoy doing it. It is not a business book. Not a self-help book either. Sometimes rude, naggingly we-are-right, and more than once contradictory. (And the jacket recommendations are too over-the-top --- one reviewer says he'd choose someone who read this book over someone with an MBA. Um, how about an MBA who's smart enough to have read the book? Or knew these things before the MBA and didn't forget them?)<br /><br />I overcame these feelings because the book is not advice. It is a description of what already worked, and continues working, for the authors. They did not even mean to write the book: it's just a by-product of their successful software business. Like those \\"inside the making of\\" freebie videos on movie CDs. Or the plywood made from waste sawdust (the latter is the authors' own comparison).<br /><br />Rework is a good antidote to all the hype about startups, venture capital, and exit strategies. Keep it simple, very simple, solve a problem that you need solved and enjoy solving. Arrange to make a profit from day 1. Stay honest. Be real. Get a good night's sleep.<br /><br />Will reading this book make you successful in your business? Of course not. You have to be able to actually do what it says. That takes self-confidence, character, and old-fashioned hard work. (Though not too hard -- no overtime!) The authors don't want you to think they're old-fashioned, but it's misleading that they're in cutting-edge yet super-simple web software. You don't succeed in that without those old-fashioned qualities and abilities. And being good at what you do.<br /><br />Postscript: I just have to tell one story that rings true with their \\"give me a break, get real\\" attitude. I went to my computer to write this review online, and discovered ... no internet. I checked the modem, saw no internet, and after checking the cables, phoned the ISP. The first two messages after I got through the menus were, \\"Due to the stormy weather, there may be intermittent disruptions in connectivity,\\" and then, with a background of hold music, \\"to save waiting time, you can enter a support call on our website.\\" And this is a good ISP. I could not make this stuff up. Oh, by the way, I checked out the window: it is not raining or snowing. Not even windy.ing good at what you do.<br /><br />Postscript: I just have to tell one story that rings true with their \\"give me a break, get real\\" attitude.

B0065CCM76|5.0|This CD is amazing, well produced, and doesn't leave out many of Bob Seger's hits at all!  Definitely would recommend this for any Seger Fan!
1576875776|4.0|I am a big fan of Vivian Maier. This book is well worth it for any aspiring photographer. Truly undiscovered talent in her time...
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I thought the game was geared toward kids. My seven year old really likes the game but gets stuck on the same level and is well no longer interested. I feel like I wasted my $$. I don't like to play it either.  I thought it was going to be fun since my son loves to build things with Legos. But this is a bit over the top.<br />Disappointed.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|i have always loved a christmas carol because charles dickens is one of my favorte authors and i would reccomend this movie to anyone who love's charles dickens
B008XG1X18|5.0|Best place to go to share recipes, decor ideas, and crafts with friends and be inspired. I love Pinterest for all occasions!
B008458O3S|4.0|I'm writing this just to counter the \\"most-useful\\" review that says this is a slow-paced game.<br /><br />I picked up this game with it was FAOTD and only recently have I just finished all the levels, unlocking \\"bonus\\" levels I didn't know existed.<br /><br />This is a logic game -- there is no timer, nor any need for \\"speed\\".  This requires figuring out the correct approach to laying tracks and switches to route trains though painters and splitters to reach the right destinations.<br /><br />The challenge of the individual puzzles has increased as the level has increased.  Many of the puzzles are simple looking yet cunning in design.  (an example is \\"Rocky Road\\" in the \\"Oakville\\" bonus level).  The author deserves credit for creating such an excellent app.<br /><br />I would highly recommend purchasing this game for the mental challenge.<br /><br />I wish the game didn't have the annoying \\"rate me\\" buttons nor the links to facebook, etc, so that it would avoid the annoying extra permissions.  I took off a 1/2 star for the network permissions required by the app.<br /><br />I also took off a 1/2 star because this versions lacks some of the features the iOS version has, such as the ability to play user-generated levels.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|So far we love guessing all the characters and playing the game. Even my four year old princess fights over the game with her brother! Awesome when we are on the go!
B008GXHOFW|3.0|I haven't. got this game yet but amazon can be good bad boring but mostly boring I not saying that its totally bad but amazon you need to get better and try and see if you can get some apps from apple because you guys are not going to last in the future and get some Color on the original kindle sincerely. iman
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I found the story line original an entertaining.  A favorite 'Flash Back' was the one with 'Gerry Perry AND His PUPPET'!  As well as poor 'Disgusting Donald' believing he was being stalked.  Each mini story line within the major story was fun and somewhat relatable to those of us who have kissed more than their fair share of frogs.  Terrific ending!  As for the theme of the movie goes, I agree that 'YOUR NUMBER' doesn't matter.  Mainly because my number is probably closer to Colin's than Ally's.  Great chick flick.  But I think guys will get a kick out of it too.
B003Y8YXFS|5.0|I bought the album when it came out and loved the music.  This music will continue to some of the best ever written, performed and produced.  I am now playing this music for my 18 year old goddaughter and she loves it.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|This was a delight to listen to.  The songs grabbed me on the first listen.  I absolutely love \\"Burn Money Burn\\" and every other song on this wonderful album.
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|The Paleo diet has a sensible explanation for why most of us are overweight.  The authors approach makes good sense. Let's just say reading the book and making changes will help you take and keep weight off.  While this type of eating my not work for everyone, I wanted to trim off 10 pounds and have successfully done so by following the guidelines in this book
B0031SCV46|1.0|Several years ago, before any of the reviews here were published, I bought an M Audio Oxygen 49.  I gave it away only because I wasn't using it.  I bought another sight unseen online last week, not realizing it had been redesigned.  The old one was very well built, with a piano-like action, solid keybed which required a reasonable amount of pressure, and was gray in color, a really solid built controller.  I tracked down a picture of the old design just now online, there is no mistake, I clearly recognized the old one for it's gray color and keybed.<br /><br />This new one is a piece of total junk.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  Back it goes.  The kedbed feels like a child's keyboard, the keys are not level, the accidentals seem small and very low, and the keys have a really, really cheap feel to them.  The entire keyboard feels totally cheap, and in all my keyboard experience, and I've bought a lot of them, this keybed is the worst.<br /><br />But it did get some good reviews here.  So you'd better try it out first, at least to feel the keybed and action, before buying it.  If you like it like this, fine.  But don't buy it without at least checking it out in a store first.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I had been waiting for this novel for a while and eagerly read it and enjoyed it thoroughly.  It ias a wide span trying to cover a lot of world events that most readers are aware of.  Of course, Follett had to omit some key events from WWII, but that did not detract from the cohesiveness of the story and the interlinkages of the characters.  From page 1 I was caught up in the novel even though there were parts that meandered, almost as if Follett got tired at certain points in the story. Follett trats all parts of the story fairly and with dignity, trying hard not to be judgemental and succeeding.  His characters were built out well and we felt for those who suffered.  The world events were interesting background for the development of the characters and their stories.<br /><br />Ever since Pillars of the Earth, I have not been disappointed with any Follett novels and I look forward to the last book of the trilogy whenever it is completed and published.  It was testimony to how enjoyable the novel was because I was left wanting for more at the end.
B007THA4FI|4.0|As with her first endeavor, I wait anxiously for her next. Her whimsical humor and depth of understanding human nature shines through her writing; she never fails to entertain and move her readers.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I have read all of John Grisham's novels, even the sports ones.  I am usually entertained by them but the earlier ones had more substance to them.  The recent ones were mainly one dimensional and predictable.  The Racketeer is somewhere in between, and I hope it signals a turn around to writing novels with a little more substance to them.  The first part of the novel had overtones of the Shawshank Redemption.  Thereafter Grisham led (or misled) us  down a path for the latter half of the novel which had me guessing for a short while.  The novel is entertaining but easily forgettable.
B0091XRL86|2.0|We tries to watch it with two 7 year olds and a 2.5 year old. They were bored and uninterested.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Very nice to see the movies from my childhood! There should not be a minimum number of words required for this. It is asking too much.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read them all and this is my favorite. I could not put it down. Great story.Great characters. It was a good read.
B007X16GFC|3.0|I just didn't like the movie. It was seriously lacking in all aspects of the plot. I knew what was going to happen in the first couple minutes.
B009CG2YDE|4.0|This is a game worth the dollar as long as you enjoy a retro tilt action game. There are 20 levels with fun game play sure to amuse the kid in you.
B00846REIS|3.0|I was surprised at how close Crossfire was to the first Shades of Gray book. It was worth a read, but probably won't read others in the trilogy.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This movie probably isn't for everyone, but it has a unique sense of humor and an excellent visual style that is very endearing. I personally was not a fan of director Wes Anderson's well known film The Royal Tanenbaums, but this movie far surpasses Tanenbaums in almost every way. The acting is excellent all around, especially Edward Norton, Bruce Willis and the 2 kids who play the lead roles. If you're in the mood for something a little different, this movie is for you.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The ending makes me want to read the next book right now! The book is very different from the others in some ways. Other ways it is a lot like the others. I like all the suspense in the book. It makes think what is going to happen next.
1433209160|5.0|Excellent narrator. I belong to a reading (listening) club in which the members circulate their CDs to each other. Everyone is enjoying this audio as much as I.
B006PYHYXG|5.0|Not much to say.  I'm using 2 of these with the [[ASIN:B0036FQ23A Ergotron LX Dual Side-by-Side Arm (45-245-026)]].  Fits perfectly on my monitor arm and gives more room to maneuver the monitors.  A bit expensive, but quality costs $.  Great product and great product line.
0062112430|5.0|This book is very well written, has amazing emotional depth, and is one of the best books I've read this year. Great start to what promises to be an even greater series.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I don't know anyone who can't use a bit of help cleaning up files and useless stuff on their computer, tablet,  this is marvelous and easy to use. Certainly glad I downloaded it.
0060254920|5.0|I purchased this for my nieces for Christmas. It arrived quickly and in great shape, no damages. I know the girls will love this book as much as their mother and I did when we were kids :)
B009NQKPUW|2.0|No big deal. Similar to Aliens but not nearly as good. I felt that the movie was trying to relive the glory of earlier successes. Nothing unique here.
B001CQONKY|4.0|I purchased this for my Sister for Christmas, it's what she wanted, and it arrived quickly and in great shape, no damages. I'm sure my sister will love it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to all the teenagers I know and when my kids get older to then especially. It is great at highlighting the confusion and struggle of being a teen and discovering the world. Very easy read and very captivating.
B009OA57MI|4.0|The program locks up on my Kindle Fire, so after getting an reply back from the developer, they said you need to close all running programs before running ANF.  That helped the program run better, but still had a lock up or two.  Otherwise the game is fun and a challenge.  Landing on the carrier is difficult, but can be done with practice.  I would give it 5 stars if there were no lock ups.
0375507256|1.0|The writing was far below my expectations. Lots of hype, but very little delivery. I found it quite tedious with very little impetus to keep me reading.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|There are many people out there who already own the digital versions of some or all of these games (Flow, Flower, and Journey) and may be wondering if it's worth getting the disc.<br /><br />I owned them all, plus the soundtrack to Journey and some of the themes, but being a PS Plus subscriber, I was running awfully low on hard drive space so getting some games on physical discs was my plan for a while. Then I could take them off of my HDD and let it breathe a bit. I figured with Journey CE, I'd be taking a few of the smaller games off plus gaining some cool extra content like the soundtracks I didn't have and the documentaries, etc.<br /><br />Well, it makes you install the games onto your hard drive, and not just part of the games. All of them. And not only that, once you click to play the games, you have to have the Journey disc in the system for them to work.<br /><br />So it was easier to delete those installs and re-install the digital versions. At least then I didn't need the disc to play since they were taking up the same drive space either way.<br /><br />Was it a waste of money? No, I don't think so. The mini-games are simple and require two players so I get little use out of them, but I do enjoy the music, all the extra avatars and themes, and the documentaries are very nice! For fans of these excellent games, it's worth the money for these little treasures and to further support the developers.<br /><br />However, if you're only concerned with the games and was thinking of getting it to have them in physical form, you may want to stick with the digital versions.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I bought the blu ray this Black Friday at a great discount, but since I'd never seen the movie, I decided to pay the $2 before opening it. Over half the movie could have been obliterated on the editing floor and I'd have been a happier woman. Tree branches turned into snakes, the forest floor teamed with bugs. I got that she was out of her mind with fear and confusion, but really, that could have been conveyed so much better. The only real saving graces to this movie are the rousing speech Snow White gives (though not on the same plane as Braveheart, LOTR: Return of the King, or Independence Day, as leaders' war speeches go) and the last five minutes. Having seen only the first Twilight movie, once, I had no idea what all the fuss was on Pinterest about Kristin Stewart being completely unable to emote. Her face changed to one of only three expressions throughout this film: gaping like a fish, confusedly frowning, and completely blank - the last of which I believe was supposed to convey her joy at seeing her &#34;beloved&#34; at the back of her throne room. The premise was good, and Charlize Theron played the evil queen Julia Roberts could only hope to be, but Snow White just fell flat. I will be returning the blu ray.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|This is a good game however you need to know this game is not the same as Dungeon Hunter 2 it is not a full RPG experience. It is like a RPG but a mix with different levels... hard to explain but you may want to go watch some videos of the game play before buying this one.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Since his passing he's still the best in the business! I liked the album because it's similar to seeing him in person in 1965 at the Newport Jazz Festival.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|My eight year old son and this is a great casual gave for me. You can play this at different levels and there are things you can unlock. You can change the backgrounds as well as everything else.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|This movie lacked plot, although the view was nice!!! I wish they would have developed the characters relationships further, but I guess that's not what some people were looking for in the movie!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|How can you go wrong... Angry Birds and now with the sling shot of planets. This is a cool game to play for casual players.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Although the writing won't be winning any prizes, it's an interesting read with some good twists.  It kept my interest the whole way through.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|You can install Plex on your pc or mac and then have it stream your videos to your Phone, Roku, Xbox, or PC.  This is a great free media server.  I used to pay to have one and now I use this one and it is very nice.  It also finds the cover art and text about the movies or tv.  It also shows the star rating to help you know if you might like it or not.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|The backpack you are looking at right now is a great buy if you have the money. This back is very innovative and I can tell you why. Certain features in this backpack are how you can push down a flap and the back pack will stand strait up(without leaning against anything),two(2) water bottle holders, netted area to keep items like headphones,so much more and of course A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE are some of the awesome things about this back pack. I Bought this backpack for my kid in middle school and he has said how awesome this back pack has been serving him. I can not say enough great stuff about this backpack. The only possible things that could be a set back is one,the price because it is $65.00 that might not be in budget (totally worth the money and the quality is super)and two, its size. It is not a \\"huge, funny looking it is so big\\"backpack but don't get me wrong, it is a bigger backpack.If you have a smaller kid, don't let this be a set back because the straps are adjustable to practicably a toddler size and there is MORE than enough padding in the shoulder straps so now madder how heavy the load is,it will be easy and comfortable to carry it. I hope this review was what you were hoping it to be and I tried to include common Q&A's so thank you for reading.
B008458O3S|5.0|I loved playing it and was happy when I saw my eight year old playing this and loving it. I would recommend it as a great app to have.
1476715904|4.0|This is a great YA book - if you don't like stories written for teens then you're probably not going to like this one. The poetry aspect didn't really inspire me but I wasn't distracted by it either. The story itself is well-written and enjoyable. It's a little predictable but so are most YA books. The sequel \\"Point of Retreat\\" is just as good (IF you like teen books).<br />My only complaint is I didn't like the different viewpoints by book. I wish the author would have alternated viewpoints through out each book by chapter instead of the first book being Lake's viewpoint and the second book being Will's viewpoint.<br />Disclaimer: I received the Kindle book in exchange for my honest review.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I loved this casual game and recommend it to anyone. You combine elements like water, fire, dirt to make new things and after you have completed most of the game there is more things that open up to you to do.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follett writes in an easy style. He makes the historical come alive with different viewpoints, he reminds us that there are two sides to all issues , and that heros and villans are all just people trying to survive the world as it existed at that time. This is the perfect book to relax with it requires no hard thinking.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|I've been reading Deb's blog for a few years now and have gotten a reputation as a good cook solely based on recipes from her site. This cookbook has amazing recipes that read like a friend talking you through it in your kitchen. Deb has a good story behind every recipe, and she makes each recipe approachable.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|This book was a waste of time shifting back and forth thru time with no real string to bind the story together. I finished it only because I cannot stop a book halfway through no matter how bad, I keep hoping it will get better, this didn't.<br />Don't waste your time  or money.
B007SGM084|5.0|I found it to be a page turner. I was pleasantly surprised to find that along with the eroticism, there was a good story line. The characters really kept me engaged. The author  successfully incorporated suspense, protagonism and action along with the erotic, romantic relationship of the main characters. It was exciting trying to figure out what was going to happen next. I almost did not read this book due to all the hype on TV... Then mostly poor reviews on my Kendall. I'm really happy a friend pushed me to read it. I would love to see a sequel, continuing the lives of the main characters in this story.  DG
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A great story that keeps you turning the page until the very end. Once again Grisham tells a story with enough twists and turns to keep your mind engaged until he bring it all together at the very end. Great for a weekend when you have nothing to do.
1451695195|5.0|the  clarity of the experience and the depth of thought in how  the writer presented the<br /><br />experience was unique and moving.
B009VB97EY|4.0|I watched Magic Mike for the same reason every other female would--Channing Tatum dressing down and shaking his booty across the stage. However, I was nicely surprised by the realistic portrayal of the film. It is not your typical mushy gushy chick flick, but goes deeper by showing very human/real emotional angles. I was generally unimpressed by the acting of most of the cast, but Channing Tatum stood out for his great acting added on to the expected sex appeal.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer is fast paced with lots of plot twists and turns.  It will keep you guessing till the end.  Not a literary giant, but a great, fun read.

So I looked up Tim on Youtube.com and here was this strange 25-35 year old alien being slightly balding like me (only his hair was blond), in a black shirt who reminded me of Ferris Beuller. He reminded me of a high school classmate of mine who used to smoke weed religiously and get straight A's in calculus. A true life hacker. I was intrigued.<br /><br />What's ironic is I first went to read and buy the 4 Hour Work Week in a Barnes and Noble in Manhattan in 2007. Some 5 years later, I'm teleported into \\"the heat in the kitchen\\" literally shaking hands with Tim in Panera Bread on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, flicking it up in photos with him, while 1000+ book stores are boycotting The 4 Hour Chef. He's relaxed, happy, has a box of sharpies, a large iced tea, a small crowd of PR people helping him take pictures, and a line of fans waiting behind me for their turn.<br /><br />I handed Tim my 450pg. self-edited, self-published, underground tome book as a gift (thinking, why did I do that? - my book has too many f-bombs in it), and proceed to watch Tim sign his Trilogy for me: The 4 Hour Work Week, The 4 Hour Body, and The 4 Hour Chef. We took photos, chatted it up, and prepared for our Book Armageddon war heroically and stoically: 1000+ Book stores vs. 4 Hour Chefs (Master life hackers, New Rich, Digital Age Sages, Accelerated Learners, and as Steve Jobs would say: \\"People who are changing the world.\\"<br /><br />What does it mean: \\"If you can't stand the heat...\\" Former president Harry S. Truman was well-known as someone who spoke very real. Nowadays politicians are just that \\"Polished-editions\\" They say Jesus spoke in parables, so we like a guy who tells you like it is: Harry S. Truman was quoted as saying long before his presidency: \\"I'll stand by [you] but if youcan't take the heat, get out of the kitchen.\\"[1] Malcolm X said, \\"A man who stands for nothing, falls for anything!\\" This is why I proudly stand by Tim Ferriss' and his new book The 4 Hour Chef. The 4 Hour Chef is really a book about meta-learning (accelerated learning), which makes most old school methods of learning skills by rote in public schools look as obsolete as tape cassettes.<br /><br />In the book, Tim states, \\"META is where you'll learn to mimic the world's fastest learners. It is possible to become world-class in just about anything in six months or less. Armed with the right framework, you can seemingly perform miracles, whether with Spanish, swimming, or anything in between.\\"[2] As a devout student of Neuro Linguistic Programming, Neuro-Associative Conditioning, Human Needs Psychology, and Strategic Intervention, I find the modeling elements to be very powerful. In fact before I really knew what to label it, I used many of these methods for creating many skills in many areas of my life. On page 38, Tim gives us the framework for META Learning as an acronym: DiSSS<br /><br />PRIMARY PRINCIPLES (DiSSS)<br /><br />Deconstruction - What are the minimal learnable units, the LEGO blocks, I should be starting with?<br /><br />Selection - Which 20% of the blocks should I focus on for 80% or more of the outcome I want?<br /><br />Sequencing - In what order should I learn the blocks?<br /><br />Stakes - How do I set up stakes to create real consequences and guarantee I follow the program?<br /><br />SECONDARY PRINCIPLES (CaFE)<br /><br />Compression - Can I encapsulate the most important 20% into an easily graspable one-pager?<br /><br />Frequency - How frequently should I practice? Can I cram, and what should my schedule look like? What growing pains can I predict? What is the minimum effective dose (MED) for volume?<br /><br />Encoding - How do I anchor the new material to what I already know for rapid recall? Acronyms like DiSSS and CaFE are examples of encoding<br /><br />How in the world was such an avant-garde book about accelerated learning boycotted by 1,000 retail stores? Why would major bookstores boycott a book that helps people learn anything faster?? Especially when our society is $16 Trillion dollars in debt. We need citizens who know how to do things, especially cook and eat healthy! Oh, of course, it's not because of the amazing content, the beautiful photos, the detailed expertise about cooking and global fine cuisine, the amazing color tabbed organization, the incredible content. It's not because this book can help anyone learn anything faster, or improve our society. It's not even because this book will transform lives, giving us all a better way to view our health and food consumption considering farming, agriculture, and the environment is changing right under our noses. One fact from this book: 50% of Farmers will retire in the next 10 years, gulp. We have more prisoners in America than farmers, if that gives you an idea.  Maybe it's the gutting of the deer on page 274 and 275?<br /><br />So I'm thinking, ok Barnes and Noble, I can see how you can reject my book. My book is loaded with F-bombs, Hip Hop rhetoric, and will raise the consciousness of youth to mind altering levels that you want to keep as dumbed down consumers in our society. You don't want America's youth to be Healthy, Wealthy, and Wise. I get it I get it. Fair is Fair. You don't want to go making young kids smart in America because... Hmmm they'll start writing, publishing, & distributing their own books and put you all out of business, and put nails in your coffins while singing \\"Lose Yourself\\" in the music by Eminem, and \\"I Can\\" by Nas. Hey, you have to protect your self-interests!<br /><br />But don't boycott our beloved Tim, the Digital Age Ben Franklin!  Tim's a great guy and he only uses f-bombs sparingly, he uses footnotes, and MLA guidelines in his blogs, and the man designs books like Germans design cars, or Steve Jobs designs computers. If you big book store chains are boycotting a Tim Ferriss' book, something is wrong. Something is terribly wrong. The revolutionary Hip Hop book will not get in the bookstore, now Tim's book about Learning and Cooking will not make it in a Barnes and Noble Bookstore either!? So what do you want people in America to read!? Garbage!?! Barnes and Noble do you know how much money we spend on you and how many mastermind meetings Generation Y students have in your café's with our Apple laptops and Iphones? Do you realize that you are messing up our style and swag!? Do you realize how many sales you are losing!? Haha....is this the best you can do while you \\"chew on your pencil eraser with attempts to erase us\\" (to quote Nas)!?<br /><br />Is this boycott all because Tim is the first to be published through Amazon?! If that's your way of sending a message to future self-publishers, digital publishers on Amazon, or authors, you are fighting a losing battle. You might as well hang up your pocket protectors, your khaki pants, and bifocals and call it quits. \\"Oooohh, we're trembling all over our laptops and bit torrent downloads, while we are taking min-retirements, view city skylines, travel, and live like millionaires.\\"<br /><br />Ok, business is war. Basically, major retailers are boycotting this book so that it will not sell, and you want all authors to have to submit our work through traditional publishing and brick and mortar store front channels. You reject independent authors like us en masse anyway. Guess what we're going to do, we're just going to empower authors to buy more books, and also raise money for teachers through DonorsChoose.org. The 4 Hour Chef is a fantastic book with strategies we can use to help all people and even kids learn.<br /><br />So that's all, if you love cooking, buy a couple copies for yourself you'll thank me later, because you'll never run into this book on the book store shelf because book retailers don't want you to! Artists, writers, & educators, like you and I can find new ways to get around traditional barriers to getting our work out to people. As a writer myself, self-publisher, and someone passionate about education reform; this is a moment for authors and teachers to send the message that we are going to grow our kids to be brilliant, not allow them to continue to be dumbed down, and herded as zombies into consumerism.<br /><br />The 4 Hour Chef (obviously) is more than a cookbook. Although the cooking instructions, and learning how to cook are a sweet bonus. As someone who studies nutrition, everything is in meal preparation and being able to empower my clients to eat and prepare a variety of nutritious meals. To have it broken down in a way that teaches cooking, allows me as a personal trainer to transfer the skill of cooking to my clients as well. Not to mention the recipes, which are specific masterpieces that build on the artistry. Better cooking is a journey we all must take. We absolutely all must learn to feed ourselves in a healthy way and improve our wellness. I think this book is an outstanding tool to do that. The Chapters are broken down by these beautiful colored tabs into what Tim calls  \\"THE MENU:\\"<br /><br />1. META-LEARNING (YELLOW- META) - L'ANTIPASTO - Before you learn to cook, you must learn to learn. META charts the path to doubling your learning potential.<br /><br />I found this chapter to be very helpful, and I'm glad he gives a broad overview of how to follow the process of META-LEARNING. It really sets your frame of mind that you can do this. You can learn to cook. Swim. Shoot 3 Pointers. Shoot Rifles. Speak in public. Learn multiple languages. Start a business online. You can do it!<br />2. THE DOMESTIC. (BLUE - DOM) - IL PRIMO - where you learn the building blocks of cooking. These are the ABCs (techniques) that can take you from Dr, Seuss to Shakespeare.<br /><br />This chapter is like the primer to dust of the pans in the kitchen and get into cooking shape. I'm as guilty as the next guy for eating Tuna out of the can, microwaving plain egg whites and eating them quickly with no flavor, and slapping meals together without much thought (as long as they are healthy). But many of my clients do not share my same Spartan enthusiasm for eating broccoli or spinach for breakfast. But here is the key, to create healthy, and nutritious meals, that look good, are good for you, taste good, and are good for others!<br /><br />3. THE WILD (PURPLE - WILD) - IL SECONDO - Becoming a master student requires self-sufficiency in all things. WILD teaches you to hunt, forage, and survive.<br /><br />I showed this chapter to the doorman in my apartment building. Boy was that a conversation starter! He talked about killing animals where he's from in the Caribbean. The other guy was looking at Tim gutting a dear with a funny look of disgust. This is about Survival. After just having survived Hurricane Sandy, and delivering turkeys and food to families in the Rockaways amidst dust, torn down homes and debris, as well as listening to KRS-ONE's song \\"Disaster Kit\\" This chapter has my full attention. Thank you Tim. F-you Barnes and Noble! LoL This chapter is what we need to give us certainty, in some of the uncertainties of our basic survival as humans. All the tools are listed which one needs to survive in the wild.<br /><br />Tim points out some important issues. One. In 2012 we all are addicted to the digital world and GPS navigation. Digital dependency is a habit that might be useful to break. The more detached we get from nature the harder it will be for us to survive should a natural disaster occur. Secondly, because we are so dependent on the electrical grid (even if the power does go out - As it did in Hurricane Sandy) we often have no fail proof plan for generators, food storage, water, and heat etc. He also points out in his NERT (Neighborhood Emergency Response Team) training that it could take a long time for a rescue team toget to you, which is what happened with Staten Island residents after Hurricane Sandy. He gives us the rule of threes for how long we can survive without: Shelter 3 hours, Water 3 days, Food 3 weeks.<br />4. THE SCIENTIST (RED- SCI) - IL CONTORNO - is the mad scientist and modernist painter wrapped into one. This is where you rediscover whimsy and wonder.<br /><br />This chapter is very interesting and great for exploration and curiosity about the biochemistry of the body and the chemical reactions of food in our body. This is also a great chapter to understand supplements and ingredients that are in foods. The other cool part about this chapter is understanding chemical reactions: Gels, spherification, emulsification, foams, solvents, powders, fermentation, dehydration, oxidation, transclutaminase, the maillard reaction, pressure cooking, denaturation, liquid nitrogen. He also has a cool section on the NYC Food Marathon (Tim eats 26.2 dishes, in 26 locations in 24hours), which is a love for New Yorkers, with the addresses and locations of great spots to eat. That alone is worth the price of the book in itself!<br />5. THE PROFESSIONAL (BLACK - PRO) - IL DOLCE - Swaraj, a term usually associated with Mahatma Gandhi, can be translated as \\"self-rule.\\" In PRO, we'll look at how the best in the world become the best in the world, and how you can chart your own path far beyond this book.<br /><br />In this chapter, we get the proper process to become a Professional Chef. I'm sure this one will increase the birthrate! Many ladies love to get to a man's heart through good food, and many men love cooking a classic timeless meal that makes a woman smile. If we're going to live 5 star lives, it also might help to know what's on the menu, or how to read it for that matter. We get to peek inside the mind of professional Chef Grant Achatz of the Alinea the #1 ranked restaurant in the United States and #6 worldwide, according to 2011 San Pellegrino Top-50 Rankings. We learn that\\"Flavor is For Pussies\\" and that to \\"create a meal that people talk about for years, we have to consider a full sensory experience, including texture, presentation, service, and more.\\" Why, as Tim puts it, \\"When you think about food creatively, you think about everything creatively.\\" We learn that to be Avant-Garde aka (THE BEST IN THE WORLD) we have to raise the bar in: creativity, complexity, volume, timing, and consistency. We also learn Grant's 10 principles of Creation: Serviceware, Reversal, Technology, \\"bouncing\\" Flavors, Rare Ingredients, Form Mimicking, Texture Manipulation, Profile Replication, Themes, & Aroma. And last but not least we learn in the 4 Hour Chef about: Finesse, Sense of Urgency, and Simplicity. This is how we create masterpieces with our dishes, or any skill we want to be world class in.<br /><br />I was so inspired by this masterpiece of a book that I am applying Tim's META-Learning formula and strategies to become a consistently paid Professional World Class Speaker (Top 5% of Speakers In the World) in 6 months by taking my current $2,500 per diem in Speaking revenue to $25,000 per diem, consistently by a 6 Month deadline June 1st, 2013. Snooki of Jersey Shore was paid $32,000 to speak at Rutgers University, and Rapper Lil' B spoke at NYU, so clearly I have more to learn about the world of paid speaking. Bristol Palin does conferences, fundraisers, special events and holidays, as well as abstinence and \\"pro-life\\" programs for $30,000 an appearance. Her mom Sarah Palin only charges  $100,000 per engagement. Kim Kardashian routinely rakes in $50,000 to $75,000 for appearances. My speaking ability to change a person's life and wellness is at least worthy of being heard by society, if society is willing to pay these fees for celebrity! The old guard of speakers say I should \\"pay my dues\\" wait for years and years until you are \\"accepted by the NSA lecture circuit\\".... What's a digital age life hacker who wants to be a world -lass speaker in 6months to do?  Enter my new buddy Tim Ferriss and The Four Hour Chef... Sound impossible. Not with META-Learning.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of my all time favorites! The characters are so rich and feel like I know them.  The show is engaging and almost too real. I wanna check for walkers after every episode, lol I can't wait for each new episode to see who the next new face will be, or which of the old faces will be taken. Great show!!
B00866H7SS|5.0|I Loved it, can't wait for the 3rd book to come out!! Also like that the lead is a strong character.
B0091XRL86|3.0|The kids got a giggle out of it, but I was not impressed. It seemed a bit boring. The kids only watched it once, usually if they Luke a movie they will ask to watch it again.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|An easy light teen read, I enjoyed it as it was easy to get into and follow the characters. Not for the more mature readers.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a wonderful visual reference to save pictures and their links so you can revisit an item and go back and make that recipe, crocheted item, crafts, gardening project, etc. I love Pinterest, and it is easy to get addicted. I use it on PC and on my i-touch as well as my tablet.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I really enjoyed both 1&2 books! At first I thought it was too similar to 50 Shades but I couldn't put it down!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I tried this first on my pc (a compaq presario) so that I could look at a couple books that I was interested in. That led me to purchase a coby Kyros tablet and downloaded the Kindle for Android on it. I am thrilled. I could have gotten a plain kindle, but wanted a internet access. I love the way the Kindle for Android works. It is easy to read, simple to use.
B007R41E8O|3.0|i enjoyed this game. good for the price. stopped working a few times while in play on my kindle and had to repeat a few steps. other than that, good graphics and great ho scenes..
B000JMKQX0|1.0|This is was one of the worst books that I read for a long time. He is just working the cliches over and over again. There is nothing new or original. It is hard to understand how this book got such a hype. Even if this was free, I wouldn't recommend anybody to read it.
B006ZAZ31U|3.0|Its was a good book, unpredictable at times and exciting. I thought it was a bit long winded and lacked great detail of all the heroic actions that he earned his medals from. Not that its a bad thing but it has alot of preaching for god, but as you read the book you will understand thats the way he would have wanted it.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|This was a present for my dads birthday he is into all of the classic rock and there are some really good songs on it and he liked it very munch
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have read several books on navy seals and this one doesn't fall short of the best. Well written, there are points in the book i have to remind myself that its real, that him and his team endured and sacrificed as much as they did. You really get a chance to know and respect the lives of all these men and the sacrifices they make.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This cable has a great length but i thought it was going to be a lot thicker but it still is doing the job
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I have read several books on the subject of the seals and this one is the best by far. Its nonstop action from beginning to end. Extremely well written. The situations and experiences this man endures will amaze you and bring you to the true core of the greatest men that live and die for each other and our freedom.
0783226837|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over.  Love the characters.  Easy and enjoyable to watch over and over.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very high paced action, very well written. The book really takes you to the truth and the unprecedented task of finding and capturing osama bin laden. You really get to see the moral fabric of great men who ask nothing in return for thier lives to protect us as a nation
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Ive been lifting on and off for several years now and reading this book helped me realize significant gains esp in the squat and deadlift. I also liked the movement tutorials and cleaned up my form on all the major lifts..great book.  Definitely recommend for new and experienced lifters.
B00138CXFS|5.0|\\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" is a great work of art.  The Jefferson Airplane was one of those many San Francisco groups that emerged during the era of the Summer of Love during the late 1960's.  The album contained two Top 10 hits, \\"Somebody To Love\\" reaching #5, and \\"White Rabbit\\" reaching #8 on the Billboard Hot Singles chart.  The album reached #3 on the Billboard Albums chart.  Jerry Garcia from another San Francisco band, the Greatful Dead once said during the making of the album, \\"This is surrealistic as a pillow\\".  Although he was never present during Jefferson Airplane's recording sessions, that was how the album got its title.  Grace Slick, Marty Balin and Paul Kantner share vocals on various different songs on the album.  Once you hear the tracks it has a great sound that will take you to the times of the West Coast sounds of that era, regardless if you were around those times or not.  Other tracks like \\"She Has Funny Cars\\", and \\"Today\\" are well worth listening to.  \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" captures the psychedelic era of 1967 and still sounding great today.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|It started out a bit slow,  but picked up momentum.  In the end I was rooten for them.  I didn't like the way it ended, there should been more there .
0316098329|5.0|A gripping novel from the unique viewpoint of a 5 year old whose life revolves around a confined place where his mother is held captive.  He calls this place Room. Room and his mother is all that 5yo Jack knows other than the captor, Old Nick, whom he is kept away from safely in a wardrobe. Gripping right from the start, memorable, astounding, frightening all describe this incredible novel.<br />It has been two years since I read this book and I still refer to it, talk about it to other writers and readers. What a brilliant slant: the voice of a 5 year old telling the story. Kudos to writer Emma Donoghue!
0425263916|4.0|It' Full of hot passion and love, and make u whanted more and more. What i can say about Reflected in you, is that despite of all  the barriers between them, their love always win ...
0525953728|5.0|I purchased this book, because I wanted to know the truth about the raid on Osama Bid Laden compound, not what the media has been telling us. Its a grerat Book.
B000GIXLO8|5.0|It was just as I ordered in great condition and I am very happy with the movie. It is one of the best!
0547884591|4.0|I am currently reading the 4 hour chef and about 1/4 of the way through.  What you get in the front end of this book is the method Tim Ferris has used to master many skills, from kickboxing to tango.  The vehicle he is using to teach this method is cooking.  What I love about his books, the (4hour work week and the 4 hour body also) are that he teaches things that can be applied RIGHT AWAY, and not just in cooking but in your everyday life.  Tips on how to focus on whats most important in order to get better results.  I am not a chef, but learned from a few when I was in college working in a restaurant.  I really think this book could teach anyone the skills they need to make their own meals.  I do this already, and have still learned a ton.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone interested in either cooking or learning any other skill.
B003AKLFAG|5.0|This is really a fantastic film.  The other 5-star reviews are adequate so I will simply add my rating to the tally.<br />Great film.
0307887448|5.0|Could not get enough of the book from beginning to end. Wish there was more to read and anxiously awaiting a sequel.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a nice hidden object game with a good storyline. I have played this on Facebook and the play on Kindle Fire is not much different. Some of the graphics are rather small which makes the game much more challenging. Though some have complained of having to purchase things in order to play,  I have not found this to be at all true. Play smart and your resources will last.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|This is ok, but not very easy to use. I would like more functionality out of it. Too hard to navigate.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|The bulb replacement is awesome, much brighter easy to replace, etc.  The button switch is junk, it rattles a lot, doesn't fit ALL maglite-esque flashlights, and overall feels cheap.  Luckily all i wanted was a good LED conversion for my old flashlights.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Keep this one handy for rainy days. One of the best shows on TV, pulls the viewer in like Lost did a few years ago. Great writing, so enjoyable.
0316228532|3.0|One of the main characters drops dead on the second page.  You spend the next couple hundred pages sorting out the large cast of characters, their children, all their connections and their nicknames.  JKR should have a glossary for names. It is very entertaining and hard to put the book down once  you learn the names and relationships of many characters.  It almost seems like a sequel.<br /><br />This book is not written with the eloquence of prior Potter series, and lacks the creativity.  It focus on selfish, superifical adults and children who have their own agendas.  The death of one character leads to people getting paranoid as a power struggle erupts for a Council seat.  JKR tackles social issues such as drug addiction, adoption, racism, and people using deceptive Web postings to hurt others with unintended consequences.<br /><br />Overall it is entertaining if you can survive the first third of book.  There is heavy use of English slang(nappy's ?)largely unexplained and memorizing of people's nicknames if you don't want to be confused!  I think the speed of introducing alot of characters(20+) is chaotic.  This book exposes the very dark side of human nature, I don't understand how someone could say it is a comedy!  It is anything but funny.  I think cynical is better word.  The only reason I pushed myself through the beginning is because I loved her prior series and was curious what her message was with this book. The ending offers some hope for the good side of human nature but leaves some issues still unresolved.  Maybe another book for more solutions?
B005O7PXNS|4.0|Castle has a good story line, and with the whole season on a Kindle, it's easy to catch up on past episodes.
B005KELW26|5.0|This is the one that I wanted. I didn't want the other one. I didn't get the Kindle fire HD. I only got the Kindle fire. I like this one much better and I like the fact that it has a cloth to wipe the screen.
B008NABUU8|5.0|This is a great game.  Love to play when waiting or needing to kill some time.  The levels get harder &amp; harder
B0057UA4FY|5.0|My son is a huge Star Wars fan.  He loves this DVD!  There are multiple episodes on multiple DVDs - a good buy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books were good.  Needed to keep reading through all three.  Could not put them down.  Could have been one book.  Only complaint....WTH were we left out of the trial and only give that psychotic episode with drug induced, in and out of consciousness of our heroine.  We deserved to see how that played out.  It was chicken shit for the author to leave it out.  If you can't do the scene justice....re-write until you can.  Sell out....big time. After that....it was just to wrap the whole thing up and get it out in the stores to start making money.  Sad.
B00A12VJZM|5.0|Grrr!  has all you would want for a Stones fan!! Rock on!!  From the first song 'til the end it's quite a ride!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|In this book there were no people with noble intentions.  I think you'd have to believe that people are inherently bad to have written like this.  The only &#34;good guy&#34; is someone who is dead.  It's not realistic and it's a big big downer.  I coud not wait to get through this book, constantly hoping for some goodness to shine through.  In the end...I just got to the end.  It was a complete waste of time.  No redeeming features.
0887431461|5.0|My daughter, who just turned four, LOVES to do these.  The only downside is that she's almost done with it after just 3 weeks because she wants to do 10-15 pages a day.  But there could be worse problems, right?
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I bought the movie for my younger siblings and they were thrilled to watch it. When they're happy, I'm happy :)
0547884591|5.0|I started reading the 4HWW last summer and I've been hooked on Mr. Tim Ferriss ever since!  I have read all his books, followed his blog, etc etc.  I was so hooked on this book I read it in 2 days, although I did scan through a couple sections.  I love learning the secrets in learning anything and all these life hacks are in this 1 single book.  I have never read a more perfect well put together book.  This is an easy read and you won't want to put it down.  I seriously can't stop making compliments about this book.  After reading this book, I have put my business plan on the fast track by applying his methods in every book.  Thanks Tim Ferriss for writing these books and changing my life.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I really like a capella music and these guys make all the different sounds.  It's so fun to listen to.
B00914JWSW|5.0|&#34;Release Me&#34; is the title of Barbra Streisand's new album. I did not know what to expect. You hear the term , outtakes, you assume that the songs are lesser efforts than what  Barbra included on her records. Some of the cuts were supposed to be included in a 3rd Broadway album that never happened. ( Songs from Hallelujah Baby, Finian's Rainbow, Brigadoon, The Wiz).Other songs  like Didn't We, Willow Weep for Me had been recorded by a lot of other artists. To me, the standout song is Barbra's recording of Randy Newman's ,&#34;I Think It's Going To Rain Today&#34;<br /><br />If Barbra Streisand has any more hidden treasures, feel free to release them.<br /><br />Outstanding recording.<br />Highly recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I had heard of this game and looked for it on the app store and finally found and bought it. Great and challenging game. Easy 5 stars!! The last levels are my least favorite.....
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Got my blood pressure up! Fast paced. I always like Tom Cruises movies. Good action, if not a perfect story line.
B000NY12CI|5.0|It was so well written and I feel I have learned so much form another part of the world. I feel every woman should read it.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I love anything Van Morrison does. This is a great cd! I listen to this at work at my desk. Great music always from Van.
B00ABO573A|4.0|True love can be difficult to realize in the face of innumerable and unknown life impediments. These impediments, along with self-inflicted wounds from the emotional DNA we all carry (and which often expresses itself in relationship(s) with others), leaves these two people blissful, vulnerable and ignorant.  Drug addiction or an addiction of any kind is anathema to any relationship(s). Often there is the enabler/co-dependent and the addicted one, who doesn't perceive the danger ahead. We get all of this in Keep the Lights On. It is a roller coaster of discovery for both of the individuals in the relationship, fascinating and heartbreaking to watch, but never vapid.  Over a decade, the individuals in this story really do try to find a way to make their relationship work and it was refreshing to see the enormous, even herculean effort the two principals in this love drama expend in order to save each other and their relationship. The acting is superb and the attention to detail in the direction (showing not telling), draws the viewers into the depths of what two individuals may experience on the road to finding themselves and one another.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Did not make it all the way through the movie, special effects were good, but kind of the same old story, just being honest, I heard good things, but eventually just existed the program.
0547884591|5.0|I'm not done reading it yet, but already I have got way more than I expected, and I expected a lot. I thought I was used to the Ferriss effect after reading the 4 hour week and the 4 hour body but I am still flabbergasted. The book is so rich in tips, tricks, out of the box thinking and wonderful quotes, not to mention the wonderful \\"teach you how to cook\\" lessons and \\"apply to almost everything in your life\\" advices it's simply amazing. The instruction is simple to follow, no BS, backed up by research and often counter to current knowledge yet always straight to the point. Seriously, this is the kind of book that if you only follow 10% of the instructions can totally change your life. I don't know how he does it, just pushing the bar higher and higher every time. It's pure delight. What's he going to tackle next? Spirituality? BDSM? How to cure cancer? Fix global warming?<br />I've been a fan since I read that article in Wired magazine, then bought the 4 hour body, the the 4 hour week and couldn't wait for this one. I tell you, this man might just be the Leonardo Da Vinci of our times. If he ever runs for president, I'll become political and work for his campaign.<br />It is not only a cooking book like no other, it's way, way more than that. Simply delivering way more than expected... Brilliant!
B003HV0TN2|3.0|This one gets as much hype as George R R Martin's Game of Thrones Series so I was expecting to go along a similar ride. It was in fact not very similar at all. More like a plodding, unamusing version of Harry Potter at University without all the character development or a particularly likeable lead. In fact the lead was boringly narcissistic and many of the other characters only there to support the lead character. There was quite nice world building and an immediacy to the environment so thats why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2.But this is not a &#34;mature&#34; book. Strong characterisation is important in my choice of novel and this certainly didn't have that. I also found the story quite plodding as well. Worth a read if you're a fan of fantasy.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|My son loves this movie....and so do I.  We watched on Amazon Instant and it was great! Do yourself a favor and watch it with your kids.
0380789035|2.0|This book was one of the most painful reading experiences I can ever recall having. I had zero connection with the main character. The story is bafflingly disjointed. I purchased it solely on the 5-star reviews here on Amazon, an impulse buy. Never again.<br /><br />There are some interesting elements and concepts, for sure. But it's a mess. I struggled to finish it over two months, when a book this size should take me 2 weeks max. SO PAINFUL
1451613512|1.0|A perfect fit into our new American liberalism. Why not change history also. Oliver Stone? Who can believe this guy? He wouldn't know accurate history if it bit him on the \\"left \\"side! Typical of the manure we get from these people who want to rewrite history to fit their agenda. I really feel sorry for the younger generation that this filth is put upon. As one review stated \\"Use the book to start a good fire and read real history. Like \\"A Patriot's History of the Modern World\\" - by Larry Schweikart.
1451695195|2.0|THIS BOOK BEING BY A NEUROSURGEON, IT WAS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND. I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT READING THIS BOOK. BUT WAS SO DEEP I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT. I GOT NOTHING OUT OF IT. WOULD NOT PASS IT ON.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Love the visuals. Entertaining, interesting and charming all at once. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are a treat, as always .
B008KE3960|5.0|Kept me inthralled with it. Couldn't put it down. The planes are a good brain teaser on where to deploy them
B008RYN44U|4.0|I saw No Doubt on television a couple of times and love their title song.  The other songs on the album are okay and sound similar.  I think I prefer to watch and listen to No Doubt perform, but the album is still enjoyable.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|If you found this album thanks to the two most popular songs on the album to date (Tonight and Some Nights) you would be doing yourself a disservice by not purchasing the entire album. Yes, the entire thing. From intro to the closing note is a musical experience. The intro is reminiscent of old-school albums and artists like the Moody Blues and Alice Cooper (not their sound, but their intro-style), and serves as an interesting teaser to the rest of the album which shouldn't be overlooked. Then we hit the real songs, which will bring you through several different emotions. Yes you'll love the upbeat and catchy tunes of Some Nights and Tonight, but don't overlook the other songs that can be somewhat darker, and at times less catchy, but always as deep or deeper. If you only know fun. through their most popular songs, you need to listen to the rest of their songs. They are reminiscent of Queen but with less of a rock edge. If fun. continues in the right direction they could be something major!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I got this movie because I like Charliz Theron. Big mistake the movie was long, boring tedious. To make matters worse they cast Kristen Stewart in the lead...I just don't get why she was even cast in the first place, it was like watching paint dry.
B002FOQY2M|4.0|If you found fun. when they put out their seconds studio album Some Nights you may have just been passed over by the mass merchandising gods who control what you see ads for and what you don't. Then again, now that you've been warmed up to fun. maybe this will serve better as a second purchase than a first contact. While not quite as catchy and full of lyrics that will hook you from first play, this album shows a slightly less refined fun. that still bears its heart and soul for the listener to empathize with. First listen you might scratch your head and wonder if you are listening to a demo of fun. that should never have made it to your ears, but by the end of the second listen you'll start learning the lyrics and singing along. Needless to say it grows on you and by the third and fourth times through you'll be hooked, singing the songs right along with the band. So if you truly enjoy fun. for their entire second album Some Nights then you should give Aim and Ignite a fair shake, and if you let it repeat just once odds are you'll be very tempted to listen to both Aim and Ignite and Some Nights ever time you get a fun. craving.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Enjoyed it until the final chapters.  Would like to know how they got out of Yemen and back to NYC.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|The prose of the book are terrible, the repetition of phrases is mind numbing but I loved the book and couldn't put it down
B0018OAMPA|5.0|This product came on time, looked as if it was barely used, and the discs were all in working order.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|not a bad sequel but you had to have read the first and had to read the third for this book to make sense
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't put these books down, the keep me wanting more. I can't wait to read the third book in the series.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|As the third part of the set this book was predictable, boring and ridiculously fantasy based, a 'happy ever after' ending? Really?
B009E3EY38|5.0|Was never able to attend a Led Zepplin concert growing up, but this DVD sure does make me feel like I can now say I have attended.  Great concert and performance by all members especially the drum playing of Jason Bonham - his father would be proud of him.
1609611543|5.0|This book and author can be summed up in just two words: absolutely genius!  It was an extreme eye opener.  Every person in the medical field should have to read this book.  They would actually start figuring out why we're all so fat and unhealthy.  Life could be so much better for so many people.
1847879071|3.0|Discovering Statistics Using SPSS<br />This Discovering Statistics Using SPSS textbook was OK, but contains too much unrelated verbage. Not sufficient in statistical detail.

I have lost 6 lbs (144 lbs today), lost cravings, and read the entire book in 2 weeks (first book to finish in years).  It is not about weight loss but their note that not eating a lot of the salty snacks I used to let me drop some of this water weight.  Now I understand why I should be eating certain foods.  My lung capacity is more, my skin is clearing up, and I sleep better.  Just some of the skeptical things I read in the book and my co-worker told me.  Had asthma as a kid and have sleep apnea now so sleeping better is a huge thing for me including more air into my lungs when I breath.  Definitely it is an on going experiment how to make food taste better and I belong to two Asian food  eating clubs so I love to eat.  there are more positive things but you have to do it to believe it.  Enjoy
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Love the game, but during the last update a glitch formed..  Unable to plant 1/2 the crops. The game shuts down when you select the planting screen.... PLEASE FIX
B000FA675C|4.0|With all the controversy surrounding this book when it first came out I wasn't sure I wanted to read it.  I am glad I decided to read it now. I have a new found interest in symbols and cryptology. This is not the faith shaking story i was lead to believe but an interesting twist on an age old quest. I couldn't put it down, suspenseful, insightful and compelling.
0452295548|2.0|the story had value in author's accounting; but when this book was presented to another surviving stroke victim, this person felt that the story line was too self-centered to offer insights that another victim would likely experience.<br /><br />parts of the book were really valuable in giving insights into victims unable to communicate and, as such, should not be discounted.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|i love this movie and movie quality is excellent. now i can watch this movie when ever i want.  by KCP
B00499LTLM|5.0|I avoided this Sherlock adaptation at first. Not because the modern setting put me off, but because I didn't want to get invested in another BBC import (I'm looking at you Doctor Who). But, I kept hearing wonderful things about it so I figured I'd give the free Amazon Prime Video a whirl. I'm so glad I did! This Sherlock has been my favorite adaptation, by far. Holmes always used any and every method of technology available to him, so why not texting, the internet, and the like? Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss (Executive Producers, writers, and all-around Sherlockian fanboys) have done a wonderful job adapting the stories and putting them in a modern context.<br /><br />Now, to address a few of the issues I've read in other reviews. Yes, it is only 3 episodes per season. I know Americans (me included) tend to be spoiled by 22 episode seasons, but let me tell you they do a lot with 4.5 hours! Each episode is like a movie (a fact that Gatiss and Moffat are quick to remind us) and you can tell a tremendous amount of work goes into making them. Yes, it is a seriously small season, but I feel the quality/quantity tradeoff makes a world of difference.<br /><br />Next, there is Sherlock himself. Yes, he's kind of a ass- well there's no kind of about it, really. He was written that way, plus we're meeting him at the same time John is. John hasn't become his social barometer yet, so he's at his prickly finest when we first meet him in the St. Bart's morgue. It's actually one of the things I love about this series. We see Sherlock grow and change as his friendship with John develops. He's always the smartest person in the room and sees that as license to say what he wants with no regard for anyone else. John is able to shape the behavior without yelling at him and calling him a freak as so many others do. The \\"a bit not good, yeah.\\" moment was lovely to see when Sherlock realizes he may have said something inappropriate.<br /><br />Overall I would say give this a chance. It's some of the finest TV I've ever had the privilege to watch.ome of the finest TV I've ever had the privilege to watch.
0380977788|5.0|I've been reading Gaiman since last January and each time I pick up a new book I think 'yes, this will be my favourite'. Can they all be favourites? I wish this book had been around when was 10 on. I love the tone of these types of stories, and the bold, brave heroine.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Our family loves this film.  The story is a bit predictable but the ride makes it worth it.  We have been pleased with the blu-ray version.  It has the usual sharper picture and more vibrant colors.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip gets 5 stars for his first album! He did not disappoint us . His haunting, unique voice breaks through on every track. He gives us everything  from rock, to soul, to playful lyrics.Of course, there is no video, but his music is so alive...I &#34;see&#34; every performance. Perfection!
B006OAB432|5.0|This product comes with one record and a CD of the album built into the case as well.<br /><br />I typically leave the plastic that comes with the record on and unfortunately this one is a bit loose so it is kind of a pain because it bunches up as I put it back on the shelf.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to a friend.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Nice history refresher. The author seemed to have been inspired by a much earlier novels by Upton Sinclair covering a similar historical period. Characters somewhat cardboard like. Predictable but entertaining plot.
B007MAET4O|5.0|This product comes with two records and a CD of the album as well.  I am always happy when these come with a CD or digital copy since I don't have a record player for my car!<br /><br />I enjoy his older stuff as well as the new more folksy American sound on this album.<br /><br />I found this a good pressing and the Vinyl sounds even better than the CD.
B009NH9IMM|5.0|This is a great blu-ray release.  It's a best buy exclusive, but best buy has none in stock.  Amazon had it for a fair price.
B007DIQAXI|4.0|I love the pink color of the records (there are two).  I took advantage of the digital download of the full album which came with the record and was pleased.<br /><br />The only downside that I have found is that when I listen to the record there seems to be a slight pitch bend during some of the sustained notes as if it was slowing and speeding up just a touch which I have not heard on any of my other albums or on the digital copy which came with this.  This could be just my copy that does this but I was a bit dismayed.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this product.
B008JAG2AA|5.0|Was in high school when the first one came out and loved it, and have never been disappointed with any of these movies.
0812984412|1.0|The Literati Fraudsters were out in full force praising this pathetic excuse for a novel. The San Diego Union Tribune found it \\"Audacious\\". Yeah, well it was that. Passing this classic illustrated comic book off as literature was recklessly brazen, that's for sure. The Sunday Times, London, said it was \\"Astonishing...The way Mitchell inhabits the different voices is close to miraculous.\\" Really? Every voice is exactly the same - garrulous, narcissistic and nerdy, except the first voice, Adam Ewing, the 19th Century gentleman sailor, whose language is a bad parody of 'Talk like a Pirate Day' -- Har there, Me Mateys, there be trouble brewing. The Washington Times critic liked the \\"Nabokovian delight in word play.\\" (A little warning to this critic - Nabokov's ghost is gonna get you for that.) And he goes on to laud the book's 'provocative grapplings with the great unknowables..\\" You must forgive him, he's from Washington D.C. where there is a lot of provocative grappling and many great unknowables...like the budget, the deficit...  Mitchell \\"whispers\\" in the ear of The Village Voice \\" with a fizzy, dizzy energy.\\" And here's a sample. Don't laugh now, Bill Smoke, a hit man, (Could I make this up?) \\"A piece of advice, Richter, on how to succeed in the security business... The dumbest dog can sit and watch. What takes brains is knowing when to look away.\\" Bill Smoke was blowing a little eponymous stuff you know where, but I took his advice and looked away from this train wreck. If you want to read a real book, try anything by Ellery Queen, a couple of Brooklyn guys who knew something about the writing game.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Again an excellent book by Follett. Well researched, this novel continues the saga through WWII with an interesting perspective of multiple famileis and countrys. Though one must take with a grain of salt how the characters just happen to be in the right place at the right time, it is still a very entertaining read. Looking forward to the 3rd book.
B008FPZQQU|1.0|but musically, I did not find the disk appealing other than one cut. Sorry, I would not buy it again if I had the option.
B006H5120E|5.0|For anyone who loves this movie like myself, you have to watch it in 3-D!  For a change, this process only enhances the movie rather than slapping you in the face with special effects.  It's almost like seeing it for the first time.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is a great game until you reach the glitching with mine it gliched and I couldent move forward at all in all this game is great exempt for all the maintenance and glitches and how it all shuts down a lot but when its not its a fun game.
B001I0T92Q|4.0|This works well for my PSP allowing me to use two 32GB cards at once. It only reads as fast as the machine and cards but for the price your not going to find better. Plus it works in my Camera.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I have bought this in VHS & DVD. This is the first one I bought on Blu-Ray and it is much better. I have bought this movie over 8 times already but this is the first Blu-Ray.
B0089ZEEYG|3.0|FUN App I don't have that much else to say about it. But I got it for free on App deal. :-);-)
B003B1X80Y|4.0|No issues with the product. Brand new in the original packaging, nothing else to be expected. Definitely a girls movie.
0060245867|5.0|Let me start by saying that this is a wonderful book that I enjoyed thoroughly as a child. However, there is more here than initially meets the eye of the casual reader. This book is not simply a story about the perils of giving baked confections to a rodent. It is, in fact, a parable about the dangerous results of charity. \\"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\\" does a wonderful job of teaching young readers (or even younger listeners) how terribly wrong just a small amount of goodwill can go. In a world such as ours, there are few lessons that are more valuable than one that teaches that helping your fellow man is a huge mistake with serious consequences.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you like thriller movies this show it the one for you!  It keeps you on your feet and always guessing! You never know how they will ever survive and who is else is out there.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Great book, a classic!  I bought this from my daughter after she read &#34;Number the Stars&#34; in her 5th grade class.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have watched for a long time.  Great story line...characters that keep your attention.  I will probably purchase all of the seasons, even though I watch on TV.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Mattel designers did a great job on recreating the likeness of Katniss.  My daughter is tickled and wished there were more Hunger Games Barbies to purchase.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm happy that I had the opportunity to read the books before watching the show.  Both are good, but the books provide considerable more insight to the characters.  Can't wait for the next one!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Let's you check near by activity and see the strength of of all the signals and how they vary . Very entertaining to say the least
B004LROMQG|5.0|I've been a fan of this series for a long time and enjoy watching them over and over.  It's a good family show.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It's a must-have for cello and piano lovers who don't necessarily like listening to classics all the time. Nice interpretations of popular music. Nice take on combining the classical and the popular.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As with the other books in this series...you can't put them down once you start reading.  Never a dull moment and the detail is fabulous.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Suspenseful and a great love story. I have seen them all! This is the prelude to the last movie which will leave you breathless!
B009VB7QQA|4.0|If you read the book and hoped that the movie would be like it, you will be disappointed.  The only similarities between the two seem to be the fact that good ole Abe killed vampires.  The story lines are really completely different.  I put that out of my mind and just tried to enjoy the movie for what it was.  The special effects and fight scenes throughout the movie are incredible.  It was an enjoyable movie.  The biggest disappointment of differences between the book and movie was the ending.
B0078N2T8I|5.0|Take Shelter was one of those movies that never lagged, it wasn't a show that kept you on the edge of your seat but it had a steady pace throughout.<br />They used everyday actors, which made the movie more realistic. You couldn't help but wonder if he was mad, in a constant dream state or was everything he saw real.<br />I will watch it again this week with family, and have recommend it to friends.<br />It's good watching a show with little vulgarity, no nudity or sex and the violence is all in your head when you watch and try to figure out what's going through his head.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Okay, first, I'm not really a Woody Allen fan.  I have no other movies of his on my \\"All time favorite\\" list, but this movie has made it into my top three movies of all time (the others are Il Postino & Amelie).<br /><br />The music alone is enough to love this movie, but Owen Wilson is just an absolute perfect cast as Gil, the writer who yearns for another time, another place.  This movie is visually appealing and if you have any knowledge of writers, you will enjoy the cameos of past writers throughout--Hemingway is my favorite, but I also love Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein and the guy from The Piano as Dali.<br /><br />So many great lines throughout.  Yes, I have heard a couple friends of mine say \\"it's kind of slow.\\"  Well, it is.  The opening scene of Paris is about 4 minutes of music and shots of Paris.  That is the beauty.  However, my 11 year old daughter has watched this more than once and if it can keep her attention, it will probably keep yours if you aren't someone who normally watches thrillers and big-explosion movies.<br /><br />I have watched this movie about seven times and it just never gets old to me.<br /><br />If you have ever yearned to live in Paris, write a novel, or for another time, this movie may be a good fit for you.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The movie starts out great, with spectacular scenery, and intriguing scene and then kicking in to the action.  Pretty quickly we are following the starship Prometheus on its secret mission.  The setup is a pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo, but still hints at a cerebral plot.  Though the protagonist (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend look and act more like movie stars than scientists, the fact that they are supposed to depict scientists seems hopeful.<br /><br />Yet, the movie quickly degenerates into Rambo-like action.  Wind hurls our heroes around and mysterious aliens attack them, and they jump and shoot and cut and run and fight.  Tom and Jerry cartoons have deeper plots.<br /><br />It's a good movie if you like mindless action (sans car-chases and machine guns, sorry).  The scenery and special effects are worth watching.  Acting and dialog is mediocre to so-so, and the plot is from a vending-machine.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game on my kindle fire, its the basic solitaire game runs great and is perfect for spending a little down time. its even better that it is free. great deal!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I really loved this movie. I watched it once on Netflix and when I saw it on a black Friday special I knew I had to buy it. I am an adult who still loves new Disney features and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to watch it with my mom.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of the best movies ever made.  Acting, story, plot, cinematography, and scenery all combine for a memorable experience.  There are some tough parts (graphic) and some tender points but in the end you'll feel hopeful and full of life.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I saw it in the theaters, and own it, and it gets better each time I watch, as I can pick up on more things, I wish just once that Leo DiCaprio would win an award for one of his movies!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer was everything I expected. I enjoy John Grisham's writing and needed something light to escape to. It definitely did not let me down. If you like John Grisham, you'll like this book. The ending was particularly interesting and a good weave.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I did not like the tv show.  A dull soap opera with cheaply done spooky sets.  I dismissed this movie when it was in theaters.  The trailer fails miserably.  Because I am a Johnny Depp fan I rented it when I was bored and it was cheap.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I expected a shiny lump of coal but found a nearly discarded gem of a movie.  The cast is top notch and the sets and cgi are indistinguishable from reality.  They somehow kept the theme and backstory but replaced the stupid soap opera core with an uplifting and fun resurrection of family and personal integrity plot.  You come to care about barnabas and his family by the end.
079073639X|4.0|This film received universally negative reviews and performed poorly at the box office when it was released in 1998. Because of that reputation, I avoided viewing it until just the other night. I almost feel like I'm going out on a limb when I admit I really enjoyed it. The acting was great, especially Sharon Stone, and the plot kept me guessing until the very end. Granted, the concluding scene itself was probably the weakest thing about the movie. Sometimes the action was a little hard to follow. I suspect that was an intentional reinforcement of the dream-like narrative, though there are some genuinely clumsy editing transitions. What I liked best about the film was its emphasis on the character's psychology, as seen mostly through the eyes of Hoffman's character. I guess anyone who has worked in a dysfunctional office can relate to the petty little psychodramas that deprive the participants of true insight and, for these characters, much, much more. Ultimately, I found it quite compelling and would probably watch it again sometime down the road.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I am re-reading Les Miserables after reading it many years ago and seeing  a stage production of it.  It is still a good read.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This is a terrific story about losing yourself on a quest to find yourself.  A sort of modern vision quest.  Slightly overshadowed by the tragic reason for it and the lead characters one character flaw.  It's a great adventure though and full of wonderful characters that the boy encounters along his journey.  I recommend this film to anyone who's heart yearns for freedom and the open road.
B0095R64AO|3.0|This movie is Somewhat funny at the beginning and then starts to get a little crazy. Would not buy it but was a good rent
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game to play while watching Tv or waiting on someone. Graphics are nice, execution of play is easy to use.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Not the worst movie ever but definetly not the best movie ive ever seen. It entertained for a bit. Would not buy.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is my favorite movie with Will Ferrell.  It is sweet, wholesome family entertainment for the holidays or anytime you want to laugh.  Ed Asner makes a perfect Santa and Bob Newhart is great as adoptive dad &#34;Papa Elf.&#34;  Really, most of the casting is spot-on, except maybe for Daniel Tay as Michael, Buddy's half-brother.  His performance comes off as sullen and, frankly, he is an unattractive child.  Overall, however, this is one worth purchasing for your collection of holiday movies.  We have it on VHS and DVD, but we couldn't find either the evening we ended up streaming it from Amazon...another good, reasonably-priced option.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book. Can't wait for the 3rd one to come out. Really enjoy the characters. The author really leaes you hanging.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|But.....  If it's creators actually got what's in this movie off the book they must be on crack.  John Carter in the book was nothing like the character they invented for the movie.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Seriously, any book this guy writes I like.  What a pleasant surprise to see some old faces appear again,  Joe has a way of making grim and dark events seem less so with the human aspect of the characters he writes.  Someone might be a ruthless ice cold killer, but not always, and it also depends who their friends are....<br /><br />Books don't have to be sunshine and happy and I love that Joe's aren't.

B001NLCBJI|5.0|Bill Murray as an aging movie star is humorously brilliant.  So much of life is in fact &#34;lost in translation&#34;.  The story makes an excellent metaphor for life.

B000SOYEQY|5.0|The cinemetography is extraordinary as is the mesmorizing performance of Peter O'Toole as the conflicted Lawrence.  There is much said here that is pertinent to the issues still facing the Middle East.
B003O86FMW|5.0|one of the best series of books i have ever read. cannot wait to see all the movies! love it!
B001DUDKEY|4.0|If you're a lover of Jane Austen, this is the best movie of the book.  The musical background is Chopin, which is irresistable.
1589946006|5.0|A great product at a great price! I've kept the &#34;big&#34; ones for myself, and I've handed out the &#34;small&#34; ones to various friends and family members...
B006G2124E|4.0|There were understandable changes made in the story in order to move it along as a movie.  It still made a good movie, although everything was much clearer and far more nuamced in the book.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found this book entrancing.  The beginning chapters were a little slow, but as the story developed, I couldn't get enough of it. Don't start this on a Monday. It's is a &#34;can't put down&#34;  readathon
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I was playing the &#34;free&#34; version of this game and got to the point where I couldn't stand the &#34;ads&#34; any longer so I purchased the game.  I have been playing it regularly ever since. I have an Android tablet and I have had wonderful success in purchasing and downloading media from Amazon.com.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is super fun for the whole family.  It is simple enough for my little girl but challenging enough to have my dad and I fighting over the game.
0547884591|4.0|Want recipes AND outdoor survival tips?  Need a kitchen guide on using liquid nitrogen but includes basic knife skills too?  Have a hankering for a cook book with a few f-bombs thrown in?  If you answered \\"no\\" or was just bewildered by this description, you probably need this book more than you know.<br /><br />The 4 Hour Chef is about learning new skills with cooking just being an example (a big, multi-hundred page example). So the author doesn't lay this out in the traditional 'baking' or 'main courses' sections.  Instead he takes you through a progression designed to teach you cooking from the ground up but landing you in the Michelin Star quality at the end.  Impossible?  Perhaps but the tools, shortcuts and recipes are all there, along with delightful jaunts along the way on how Tim learned many of his skills (these are actually lessons on how to obtain skills yourself, cooking or otherwise).<br /><br />Is this book perfect?  No sometimes (even given the size of the book) he seems to skip a bit between lessons (perhaps by design, maybe you are supposed to fill in from actual experience) and not everyone may appreciate his 'talking with a drinking buddy' style of prose (cursing and all).  However if you are a kitchen-phobic or want to learn Swahili but don't know where to start, then this book will be equally adept at helping you.<br /><br />My only other knock is some mis-steps by Amazon Publishing in the print run.  Although the color pictures, printing quality and paper is generally good, of the 3 copies I purchased (one for me and the other for friends) all had some pages slightly stuck together and one had a tear in the pages from being glued improperly.  No fault of the author, but shame on you Amazon.<br /><br />However, do yourself a favor and get this book - it will expand your mind and (maybe) make you into a great cook. How many books can claim that?
B001GJ3BPU|1.0|Awful movie!! Terrible plot! Corny fight scenes. I would not recommend watching this movie at all. I gave it a one star because that was the lowest rating I could give it. If there was any lower rating, it would have gotten that.
1582701709|5.0|What a truly amazing book! I couldn't put it down AND couldn't stop talking to people about it! Those who were already aware of 'The Secrets' existence agreed wholeheartedly how positive and uplifting it is and those who hadn't yet been introduced to this life altering lesson in life found the enthusiasm in others over this book infectious!<br />'The Secret' teaches you how to be you, how to live life at one with the universe and how to be truly happy, it's mindblowingly amazing!!!
B008AX18Y6|4.0|Salman Rushdie is so absolutely one of the best writers I have read and &#34;Josep Anton&#34; is an exellent book. Go on Salman we are out here waiting for your next novel. Don't let anyone ever stop you.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Its good but could be a little better. I mean a lot of calculators can do the same stuff but, its good to have just-in-case.
B007XF0X16|3.0|The movie is an OK movie but the only thing that bothered me was that the case came broken ;( I don't know about everybody else but it gets on my nerves when a case comes in a bad condition.

B000Q7ZO8U|4.0|Got a great deal on this video.  It seemed a little long at times but was a good story and cute.  Tom Hanks narrates and is several different characters in the movie.
B006OFN0SE|2.0|Clint Eastwood's gung-ho flag-wavery butts head-on against historical fact in  this one.  But before ripping it a new orifice I'll mention the film's better aspects.<br /><br />Leonardi DiCaprio made a valiant effort portraying a man who took pains to be humanly unknowable.  J. Edgar's homosexuality, as well as his other psycho-sexual hangups, were handled with dignity and pathos: no silly tutu tripping, as per Oliver Stone. These were doubtless key to the man's character as the All-American Javert.  And the attention to period detail was meticulous. This gave it my second star.<br /><br />The real problem is in Eastwood's presentation of Hoover's worldview as if it were a necessary - or even credible - response to the reality of his times.  Slice and dice it any way you try, but the real J. Edgar was a true fascist; a racist, power-mad opportunist and blackmailer, as ugly a character as anyone he railroaded to prison. Or possibly worse: what longterm damage did Emma Goldman or Alvin Karpis really do to the institutions of the American Republic?<br /><br />Hoover's publicity-seeking as \\"Mr. G-Man\\" is taken to task well enough.  But other inconvenient facts are dealt with as cavalierly as in his files.  The 1919 bombers were not \\"Bolshevik-Communists,\\" but Italian-American anarchists.  There was no rooftop sniper at Centralia: this was just an excuse for drunken veterans to march on a local IWW hall and lynch its occupants, murdering one in the city jail.  The steel strike of that same year was not led by \\"the Communists,\\" but by the United Steelworkers, with Hoover's Bureau as corporate strikebreaker. Eastwood delights in nasty little digs at two liberal icons, JFK and Eleanor Roosevelt, via unexamined tidbits of slander from Hoover's \\"secret files.\\"  In these scenes you see his smear tactics in operation.  Yet the audience is left with this disinformation intact as \\"proof\\" of J. Edgar's skill at police sleuthing.  The Director's files contained so much nonsense as to be worthless.  Their only value lay in Hoover's authority to make them true because he said so, and ruin lives and reputations thereby.<br /><br />In the same disingenuous manner does the scriptwriter and director sidestep Hoover's role as the American Beria from 1938 on: first as \\"smasher\\" of \\"fifth columnists,\\" then as the cold war arm of HUAC.  We hear Hoover denigrate Joe McCarthy as an \\"opportunist\\" - talk about pots and kettles!  It wasn't the KGB who fed McCarthy and Cohn the tainted meat for their public cannibalism.  Hoover's own coddling of the Mafia complements his war on Rev. King and the SCLC.  But the civil rights movement was one elephant that couldn't be sidestepped, even by Clint Eastwood.  This final crusade against the public opinion that served him so well finally discredited Hoover and his Bureau of Inquisition.  Top it off with his moral blackmailing, while hiding his own \\"inadequacies,\\" and you have a dark portrait of the typical hypocrite-persecutor.<br /><br />Eastwood no doubt thinks he's offered an impartial portrait - judging by his remarks in the special feature interview - presenting the Director as a basically honest American patriot whose virtue became his vice.  Hoover in fact coined a new political type, as \\"flaggot.\\"  He magnified, and outrightly invented, enemies to justify his ever-expanding powers, using his files as a cocked gun at the head of anyone who might threaten him.  The relish in the scene of a 1919 anarchist being beaten on the floor, with true Rodney King flourish, epitomizes the flaming cold war passion still driving Director Eastwood.to be worthless.

B009LDMJGA|5.0|Soundgarden have released an amazing comeback record in King Animal.  Not that they ever released a bad album by any means, this one just continues their lineage of excellence.  The weakest track on the album is oddly enough the lead single Been Away Too Long, however, it merely falls into the 'very good' category.  Blood On The Valley Floor is my favorite cut and exemplifies my opinion that this release could easily have fit between Louder Than Love and Badmotorfinger in their catalog; it feels like a bridge between the two.  Excellent release by an excellent band who have been away too long indeed.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I love this series. The story line is so twisted and convoluted that being able to replay the entire season makes understanding what's going on much easier. And from the first few shows of this year, I can see I'll need them on DVD too!
1416955070|2.0|Giving this two stars is a gift. Had I realized the book was endorsed by Stephanie Meyer I would have skipped it.<br /><br />Start with the bad relationship framework and angst of Twilight for your base. Add the least appealing elements of Harry Potter (the drama and angst of books 5 & 6). Throw in some of the demon fighting and hunting of Buffy The Vampire Slayer. And what the hell, have some more relationship drama and angst. And top it off with a weird smidgen of Star Wars.<br /><br />Clare got her start writing fan fiction, which I can see because I don't feel like she committed to any character or story decisions. It felt like she was waiting for feedback from the audience so that she could change the story for approval. Fictional cowardice. None of the characters were defined enough for me to care about them at all. Clarey is not compelling. Not quite Bella Swan pathetic, but not far. Jace is a sarcastic jerk, and Clare is unable to generate any sympathy for his dark and mysterious past. Simon, Clarey's friend, fills out the obvious and weak part of the apparently necessary love triangle. But wait, there is more! Now you get an additional love angle for free! (I won't go in to particulars on that angle in case someone reads this and actually decides to read the book.) I would have rooted for the supposed evil mastermind, Valentine, but Clare was never able to generate any character traits or feeling of menace from him either.<br /><br />The things that make Harry Potter and Hunger Games work is that they are not about the romantic relationships. The romance is secondary to the needs of the story. Harry needs to live, to survive, to defeat Voldemort. Katniss needs to put food on the table, to protect her family, to survive. Those characters had inner strength and hard choices to make. These characters are just pathetic to me.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Nice size..not too small but not too big!  It has pockets for the extra batteries, chargers or anything else you need to tuck away<br />ok after using this for a month, I've realized it could be a little bit bigger.  I ordered an extra battery with a external wall charger and with the other chargers, there's really no room in the bag for it.  I'm still happy with the bag but would need to carry something seperately.  I guess I'd rather have it this size than something huge that I'd hate to carry

B008JGSM6G|5.0|when I first started playing it I thought &quot;well, not too bad. fun but not challenging&quot;. then I got to the higher levels and my brain had to work harder to figure out the solution. I love it! thank you for an addicting and challenging game!
B000NY12CI|5.0|What a great example of how a person can come from a very poor background in many countries and still be an influence in the world.  Hardships galore are a part of this book and well worth the read.
B005KP77WE|5.0|The orignal was a great movie. So i thought i would give this one a try. I liked it just as well if not more so than the orignal.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Generic, boring and not a thriller.  Too much John Corey wise-ass comments.  Not the old Nelson DeMille suspenseful entertaining novels.
0896898288|5.0|I had seen this book mentioned on many blogs and saw a lot of the blocks that the bloggers created using some of the modern prints and I was hooked! Just had to get this book so I can make these cute blocks. I love working with the smaller blocks and as soon as I find the perfect line of fabric to purchase I will begin my own Farmer's Wife Sampler Quilt. Can't wait!!
B007SNFTAI|4.0|Having grown up in Great Falls, Montana, and then living many years in western Canada, I identified with this story immediately. I still am unsure why it is titled, &#34;Canada&#34;, but found the content interesting and accurate. It reminded me in many ways of my own background and kept my interest throughout.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|The DVD was great and a perfect addition to the Collection of Robert Pattinson films.The movie came in the time that was stated and condition.
B009S33I68|5.0|Much better than the movie...very poignant and realistic. A must for readers wishing to understand the Vietnamese War. I will read it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is awesome!!!!! every teen and middle Schooler  should get it! doesn't cause any problems and speeds you through your math;)
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|this game is addictive, until you get to a point where the app starts crashing all the time, forgetting what you have accumulated and completed.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Having been unimpressed with the last 3 by Alicia Keys albums I was skeptical, but open minded in listening. I am surprised, impressed and delighted with this mature and wonderful album. For the most part this is a personal and thoughtful production. Leaving in the vocal imperfections increases the intensity and emotions of the performances.<br />The Pop audience that thinks they know this artist may be disappointed. The pandering to, and courtship of, the young cynical audience is mostly gone and a no nonsense approach to just making good music is put in its place. If you like good music you will enjoy \\"Girl On Fire\\".
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Ordered this movie because I love it!<br />Movie came quickly and was a great price for the Blu-ray/DVD and digital copy.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|What can you say, this is an all out action fiesta with Thor for corn-sake!! A great debut for the Thunder God.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like a lot of the teamlava game , the thing I hate is all the pop up that come on before you can play. I rally hate that wish they had all the game that are on ipad some of the better ones they don't I just got a kindle and they are not on it.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I bought this for my son who has watched it over and over again I think he really likes it
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My husband, son, daughter, and myself loved this movie. It was well done and the graphics were wonderful. It also allowed for conversation with the kids about how to take care of our planet.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Great music by a great new band. The beats are good and the vocals are fantastic. Can't wait until their next album
B007LE2VDM|5.0|Enjoyed Jar of Hearts and Distance - sample listened to the rest and it made the decision to purchase easy.  Enjoy all the songs - and haven't skipped one while listening to entire album.
0547884591|4.0|If you are familiar with Ferriss's other works and enjoyed them, this new book will not disappoint.  If you are new to his style, you might be a bit let down by the breadth and depth of his inquiry.  While he definitely gets into the heart of cooking and breaks food down in his trademark style, he probably could have spent more time on the food and less on all the other tangents he goes on.  Still, the book is thoroughly entertaining, packed with loads of interesting information and anecdotes, and certainly has plenty of inspiration for both novice and seasoned cooks alike.
159420411X|5.0|A well written logical books. Easy to read but provides inside into analytical testing and how we should be viewing and analyzing the current problems in hand.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I thought: 'a different story'? Kool!<br />But for my taste there are too much male stripper's dances. I got clearly the point about this (a bit particular) men's work after the second dance if not sooner, why insist on that?<br />Mike is very good in dancing I guess (not a specialist here) the others I would say less.<br />If you are tired of cops and conspiracy give it a try.
B0009UC810|5.0|Another blast from the past. Funny and with a slight message. It was their hay day for making a good movie. I love the music in it too.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and was so glad to finally own it! It will be a CHristmas present for my sister, who also loves it.
B006PAZMMK|3.0|This album is great. I will say this though, I got sick of it rather quickly, but this is a personal experience. Dubstep in general got old rather quickly. I was a super fan (or bandwagoner if you will) for months, then all the sudden it fell of the map.<br /><br />I recommend it to any dubstep fan however.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very well written. NOT a gore-fest but more of a social study of social breakdown in the face of a calamity. A terrific read - gripping! I truly could not have been more surprised. Its got me thinking - and arming myself....
1878424602|5.0|I love this little book and it has a special place on my bookshelf so it can be reached easily.  I love the truth and wisdom this book gives and everyone who reads it will find their own special meaning.
B002SYXCVK|1.0|Not happy feel good holiday music. Very whinny and same sound. No pep in the music. No beat to it
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I love this author. His stories are deep and moving.Also read the kite runner. Historical and personal stories told in each story.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|The plot moved along much more quickly and with less interest than other Pixar movies.  Enjoyed watching it, but it's not up to the story telling standard of the others. Also disliked the low class humor.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I received in the this in the mail today. I can't wait til I have time to watch them all.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|I ran Passmark Benchmark tests on my new system, and it always came short of the I7, but if you have some serious cooling, you can overclock this thing up to 5 Ghz. Mine is at 4.0 with a pretty good cooler, not water cooled. Paired up with a Gigabyte 990FXA MB, and 8 GB of Corsair RAM, and this is a sweet system, and much cheaper that any Intel machine.
B00ADII8YE|5.0|The Walking Dead is probably my favorite tv show due to the dramatic story line, intense action, and the overall awesome post-apocalyptic world they've created.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I finally got a motherboard I can grow into. This MB supports AM3+ CPUs which I am using (FX-8120). It supports SATA III and USB 3.0. Get a SSD (Solid State Drive) and this setup will scream. The BIOS has tons of settings and even a tab dedicated to tweaking your RAM, CPU or PCIe speeds. It's SLI ready so you can put a pair of blazing video cards in for extreme gaming - SLI bridge cable included. Cool power saving feature powers down the system when not in use, and you can just tap a key on the keyboard to instantly wake it back up, no need to boot up. The only caveat is that the SATA connectors are on the side, so if you have a small case, there may be issues with the cables getting in the way of something. I have a Cooler Master G-Lite, and it fits fine.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Well, I'm a big fan of the Reacher books to start with and this one did not disappoint me.  I found it topical, fast paced, with unexpected turns.  I'd recommend the series to anyone.  I've heard that they plan a movie with little Tom Cruise to play 6 foot plus Reacher.  Never pull it off.  My son, who is also an avid Reacher fan, says no way is he going to see that.  Reacher's size is such a vital part of his persona!
1419705849|5.0|this is the best book yet!!!!! i started reading and couldnt quit !!!!!!!! i finished it in 1 hour!!!!!!!its worth it!!! im a seventh grade 14 year old.

1465001107|5.0|loved all the pictures and can't wait til 2013..just really some great pictures...a must have for sure...its worth the money.
B008BM9L72|4.0|On first reading I found the first book silly but it intrigued me enough to read the second then the third.  Having re-read the whole series I enjoyed the banter but not the internal musings of the heroine which I found tedious and often skipped.  Some of the erotica I skipped as well as it also became repetitive.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|I would have liked a little more from the book to be included. Missed some really good parts. Seemed liked the movie was rushed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good book.  Keeps you involved and does not slow down. Very powerful statement on government control. I highly recommend.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It was a wonderful movie and funny.  With a very nice message.  I encourage for all couples to watch. We loved it.
B005WTR4ZI|3.0|The basic argument here is that yes, machines are stealing our jobs. But they're not taking away the unskilled labor so much now (as opposed to what occurred in the 19th century); rather, they're optimizing what are usually known as semi-skilled occupations (bank tellers, etc). The key, the authors insist, is or us to become even more skilled and innovative.<br /><br />While much of this argument makes sense, as a teacher, I became wary when I reached the “education“ section of the novel (near the end). The authors claim that technological developments will be able to make more (and better) students--large, online forums, smartboards, computerized testing. It‘s in direct opposition to the milennia-old ways of either one-to-one teaching or small classrooms. I can't buy into these new methods quite yet. Multiple choice assessments and algorithms are useful... but they can't replace the real, meaningful discussions that happen in smaller classrooms. For these, computers may help, but certainly aren‘t necessary.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|No. It does not have the extended episodes, but HEY! This is how the creators of the show want it to be remembered. The set also includes a lot of extra stuff not seen in the other releases. Plus! They remastered the series AMAZINGLY well. It's beautiful to watch. Shut up about the very little that has been cut, and enjoy this amazing series in HD 1080p!
B006LSZECO|3.0|After all the recommendations, I was very disappointed in the book, especially the ending.  The story became very stale after a while.  When I finished, I thought &#34;why did I read this?&#34;
B002W2U3H4|5.0|A great movie for any age.  Watched it twice. Evev got a lot of ideas for a Lions Christmas Party.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoy a story with a different twist. Definitely a little twist. I will be on the lookout from anything by Hugh Howey. Please give us more!!
B000JMLFLW|4.0|ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok and it was free so not too bad
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Love him - love the album.  Shows his range of song styles.  Been waiting since the end of American Idol for his first album.  Well worth the wait.  Would love to have a recording of Phillip's duet with Elise, &#34;Someone that I used to know&#34;.  Can't find it anywhere.
B000IMKDPC|2.0|This movie was really terrible...<br /><br /> Out of the many Super hero movies to come out since 2000-2012 the X-men series to me was the worst and the one that followed the comic book the least. To me this is like watching Dragon Ball Evolution, it's just that horrible.<br /><br /> I really still to this day don't understand why people say they love this film even fellow X-men fans because I don't get it. Ever since I was a kid I used to collect the cards, read the comic books, play with the toys, watch the show and play the games. A real live X-men movie was something of a fantasy, and to find out it was actually happening was a dream come true. Anyone who has ever cracked open a comic book or watched the Saturday morning cartoon show on Fox knows that this movie is NOT the X-men and neither were any of the sequels this thing spawned. Some characters did look good like Mystique haha no I take that back. They all look as though the person that designed them for the movie never read the comic book. Mystique is a vixen and a sexy blue skinned red haired seductress not a lizard woman but, that's just many problems I had with the movie.<br /><br /> For starters with the custom design not even in the picture it's really about how they portray the X-men and their relationships to one another. First of all the X-men even though not officially act as a military group. They have Ranks and Teams that they work with under the command of Professor X. Storm leads one Team and Cyclops leads another. Storm is not a background character she is key figure and 2nd in command to Professor X. She is the Xavier's Right hand and Scott is his left hand. Now that leads to other things about this movie that are off. Wolverines relationship with other characters in this movie. For one thing Wolverine does not like Cyclops and he doesn't bother himself with him unless he has too which means he mostly spends his time around storm when it comes to finding out what he needs to know or getting his orders. Storm and Wolverine are actually very close friends and he's probably closer to her than just about anyone on the team.<br /><br /> Which leads to another problem with the movie when Rouge is introduced. Wolverine and Rouge are not buddy buddy their just acquaintances like Co-workers. Rouge is also a grown woman and not a little girl. Jubilee however is a young teenage girl that Wolverine adores and she looks up to and admires him. For some reason this movie completely turns character roles and relationships around and that breaks the story completely.<br /><br />So as you watch the movie you think to yourself mostly ... \\"what?\\" ... \\"that's not how that happens?\\" \\"What the?\\" .. hey \\"why did they do that?\\" and so on and so fourth. Basically they completely rewrote the story of X-men just to fit it into the big screen. This is mostly a movie about Wolverine,Cyclopes&Jean Grey all the other X-men are just background characters. I did enjoy seeing Magneto and some of the other Brotherhood of Mutant villains in this one but, they kind of ruin them in a way as well. The villians in X-men aren't really Villains, they both want the same goal but just go about achieving it in a different way. Xavier wants to coexists with humans and Magneto wants to eradicate them. The movie never really explores the characters in that right and just makes this seem like another good guy stops bad guy comic book movie and that is NOT what X-men is about. The villians are just as favored as the heroes and both sides should have been explored and explained better I think.<br /><br />They tried with this one and it was a hit with mostly people who don't know much about the X-men but for the rest of us we were expecting to see our beloved comic book characters come to life and it didn't really happen. The characters in the movie are much much much weaker than they are in the comic books. I didn't understand that part at all as the other movies that came later like the Hulk,Iron Man,Fantastic 4 and all the rest did a good job at showing the strength of the characters but the X-men really didn't do to well at that. Especially with Storm and Wolverine.<br /><br />Overall this move came and we all went to see it and it was a hit but, I don't feel like the X-MEN got the type of movie treatment that they really deserved.Fantastic 4 and all the rest did a good job at showing the strength of the characters but the X-men really didn't do to well at that.

1452110581|5.0|I just spent way too much money to replace my quite new carpet so the title of this book struck a cord and I couldn't resist ordering it. I needed both a bit of sympathy and some humor. This book is really a treat for those of us who live with and love our cats. How often do you find a book written by a cat?

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I loved playing this game, but it has starting crashing with the Marmalade error - too many layers on the palette, or something like that. It happens on both my kindle (free version)  and my android phone (paid version.) Reported the problem, but have received no response.
0395389496|5.0|I purchased this item, because one of my students that I tutor with has been experiencing difficulties in reading.  THis story has inspired him to work hard and to read with fluency and confidence.  He was so happy when he was able to read the entire story through with confidence.<br />Thank you,<br />Julie Krohn
030759565X|5.0|I love Deb's blog because everything I've made from it is amazing, and if anything the book is even better. Same beautiful photos and disarming style, but it fits on a countertop and contains everything from excellent basic recipes with a twist (Slow cooker black bean ragout, which includes pickled onions as a topping option) to crowd-pleasers for the holidays (Butternut squash and caramelized onion galette). I looked through it with the feeling \\"Where have these recipes been all my life?\\" and can't wait to cook even more from it. I usually buy cookbooks with the best intentions and look through them, then forget to use them, but SK is out on my countertop for daily perusal and grocery-list making. Some of the recipes are labor-intensive but the result is ALWAYS worth it!

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I never saw this movie until one day my kids picked it at the library.  We laughed so hard at it.  So we had to get them a copy of it for Christmas.  So late to the party on this one, but excited to know there is a sequel coming out.<br /><br />Yes my kids love the minions, and so do I.

B003G4W49C|5.0|The first time I read Ender's Game, I was in my Senior year of High School in a one-semester English Literature class. The book was assigned on a Monday, and a paper on it was due by the following Monday. The majority of my class, myself included, felt there was no way we were going to be able to read an entire book and write an A-grade worthy paper in just 7 short days.<br />I have to thank my English teacher for having such good taste in literature as well as having such complete faith in his Seniors. Not a single one of us went without turning in a paper. Every one of us had finished the book in less than 5 days, and got grouchy when we had to return it to the book monitor, it was that awesome.<br /><br />Eleven years later I've bought the book in paperback twice (the 2nd time because a friend I loaned it to loved it so much he kept it), and once for myself for my Kindle and two other times for friends who wanted a little literary enrichment in their lives.<br /><br />The story line is unique and individual, the characters are so well defined they almost seem like they're real. The ingenuity and complexity of thought that went into the design of Ender's experiences and how he thinks is absolutely brilliant. Read it for the sheer intelligence and genius, if for nothing else. I, as so many others have stated in their 4-5 star reviews, promise you cannot go wrong with this book.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Been a Deftones fan for quite a while now and I'm glad to see them put out such an amazing album. Koi No Yokan hits on every emotion possible and leaves you coming back for more; purely addicting. They have grown but not forgotten what has made them one of the most solid bands. Get this album!!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have been watching Susan Boyle's career ever since she came on the scene. I have all her albums so far and will continue to buy them.  They are prize albums in my collection.  Susan cracked on a couple of the songs but all in all, she is direct and on target and on key.  It is a very well produced album and the orchestra behind her is top notch which she deserves.  The songs all made me cry because I have seen all the shows on Broadway where these songs were intruduced and they ALL brought back wonderful memories of the original performers that introduced them to us on Broadway. Susan has four albums out in four years and it is hard to wait a whole year to get another one, but if I must, the wait is well worth it.  Great job, Susan!  Thanks for the comforting entertainment!
B00A11AN6O|4.0|It's nice to know that if you don't already subscribe to Amazon Cloud Drive that you get 5GB for free with this app.  If you are already a Cloud Drive subscriber there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't add this app.<br /><br />It was easy to install, it is easy to use and (contrary to other reviews I've seen here) it does keep my folder structure and that means it is easy to find ANY photo!<br /><br />The only slight drawback that I see is that there is no way that I have found to start a slideshow once you bring up a group of photos.  If it had this feature, I would have given it five stars.<br /><br />This is a must have for anyone who either already has Amazon Cloud Drive or someone who wants to get 5GB of Cloud Drive storage for free.  Highly recommended!
B0098460O4|4.0|I agree with Simon on this one - Jonathan is strong where Charlotte does not have the volume but there are moments they do sound good but Jonathan can do it alone like Andrea Bocelli.  He will be able to sing with all the stars of his choice soon.  At his age, he is very polished with his singing and with a rew more years under him, he will be a top performer performing all around the world solo with a fine orchestra.  If it was the mix that made Charlotte sound weak, it was poor mixing, but after seeing her perform on tv and the album, she does not have the \\"it factor\\" to truly complement Jonathan.  She needs to practice her breathing to get that voice out she is holding in at the present tine.  I loved the album though and will buy the next one that comes out just to see if there is any improvement if Jonathan decides to keep Charlotte in the mix.  Charlotte is a beautiful woman and does have a voice but it needs to be pumped up more.  When Johathan sings then Charlotte follows, it seems she is whispering in comparison to Jonathan.  I know they wanted to stay together but for Johathan's career, she needs to step back.  Sorry, Charlotte, but that is how I see it as well.  The best to you both.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This app provides all the functionality you need in an advanced calculator. Some ability to modify the skin but the default is best. Works great on the new Kindle Fire HD.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|first of all I would like to start that I love the game oats free and all. But this game is a ripoff why because this game is charging me real money for no reason
B000002JOF|5.0|Personally, I love this effort...my sweet heart doesn't. I owned this recording on cassette tape....that is why I ordered the CD. Chris Rea chronicals a society's movement into desperation....he chooses the freedom of Texas. All of the music is understandable and original. All the words in the songs form a wonderful message. Of course the melodies will stick in your mind. It is a study.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book and this whole series really-it is a fun, sexy read and a great discussion topic between friends and yes-even with my husband!
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I tried installing this from the Google Play Store to my Nexus 10 but instead of \\"Install\\" it says \\"Your device isn't compatible with this version.\\"  I gave it three stars because I can't honestly evaluate it but am annoyed I can't install it.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I probably know more about S&M than I ever care to know but I found the book to be very entertaining--especially the characters.  I've been stressed out for quite a bit and needed something easy to read just to take my mind off of things.  This is exactly what the book did for me.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great app-has given my family hours of fun and is especially convenient on road trips. Easy to use and serves as a good skill builder.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked seeing the evolution of the characters throughout the series.  What is especially fun in this one is where you get to see his point of view.  That is almost another series on its own.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app. I love the daily reminders and the devotionals and the easy share feature. I have enjoyed this app.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|Decent app with good features, but the password function doesn't work properly. Sometimes the back button is active and you can bypass the security straight into the last entry you made.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am a big fan of romance and suspense but held off on reading these because of their explicit nature. I finally gave in to the peer pressure and have enjoyed every minute!
1423140591|5.0|Not-so-brief summary:<br />~Percy wakes up after a really long nap and can't remember much about who he is. He makes his way to a camp for demigods, but even though he feels like he belongs at a camp, he feels like he isn't at the right one. Everything feels off to him, like the names of the gods and even the way they behave.<br />~Hazel is supposed to be dead and can pull riches from the ground that have a tendency to kill anyone who touches them. But Hazel has an even bigger secret and she's afraid that her friend Frank won't want anything to do with her if he finds out.<br />~Frank has been told his whole life that he's from a long line of heroes, but with is bulky build and being slightly klutzy, he feels nothing like a hero. And Frank also has a secret that he's keeping from Hazel.<br /><br />Percy, Hazel and Frank seem like an unlikely trio for a quest, but they head to Alaska to free Thanatos, the god of death, from the clutches of Alcyoneus, Gaea's first born. It's a big quest, especially since none of the good guys can win a battle with the Doors of Death open and Death himself unable to take souls to the underworld, but if they don't succeed then they, along with all of their friends, are in big trouble.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />I loved being back in Percy's head! I love Rick Riordan's books. There's so much action from beginning to end and this 500+ paged book flew by. There are three different POV's in this book and I had absolutely no problem keeping them all straight in my head. They all have unique personalities and are very entertaining.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />I wish Annabeth would have made an apperance in this book, but I guess I'll have to wait for The Mark of Athena to see Percy and Annabeth reunited. Good thing it's sitting right next to me :)<br /><br />Brief thoughts:<br />It was nice to see some of the old characters again and I can't wait to (finally!) see them all come together again. The books are written for a younger audience, but I thoroughly enjoy them :)dience, but I thoroughly enjoy them :)

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Of course I loved it! Went to see this in theater 4 times, and this is probably one of my favorites of the series, I put it in when I need a background movie or just some relaxation time. I still don't like a few of the things changed, but hey, a movie won't always be exactly the same as a book. Recommend, recommend, recommend!

B008NNNF7G|5.0|This is the album of the year! You can just leave the album on rotation, it never gets old. A little country, a little rock, clever lyrics, just a great album overall.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I have owned this album on vinyl since it first came out, and the CD version sounds just great (even without the scratches and pops).<br /><br />If you are not familiar with this album, it is one of the best of its genre and era.  Good song writing, splendid musicianship, and a strange sense of antiquity.  Enjoy
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Personally I really enjoy this album. More than anything the vocals are peculiar and interesting. Add some unique instrumentation and a great collection of songs it does make. I have been listening to this frequently since its release and still enjoy it very much.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|It was a cute movie. There were a few funny scenes. I was hoping to laugh more than I did. For a kids cartoon, it ran slow every once in a while. After renting it, I wasn't urged to go out and buy it.
B007885IJU|5.0|Very nice package and great audio quality. This album in particular is well worth owning for your record collection. If you love the Lumineers already it is well worth the investment.

They had amazing lyrics paired with a unique music style and I couldn't resist looking more into them.<br /><br />After checking out more of their music I was hooked. They have uplifting, challenging lyrics paired with awesome vocals and unique musical backdrops. I'm smitten with this band and with this CD and listen to it on repeat!

B007N5YIUS|5.0|My grandson loved it.  I downloaded for him kept him busy for hours.  He said it was great,  He is 9 years old
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I liked this movie, I am a huge Ridley Scott fan. I also know and love the original Alien films. This movie is strangely fascinating and a little cryptic at times. It is a huge step away from the Alien films, so don't try to get your self ready for battle scenes between a heroine and an alien...yet. I did find the fact that I had to go around online to find plot explanations a bit weird, but also interesting. There are several scenes that make you wonder why these characters are flimsy and poorly defined. But it is a beautiful film, cinematically speaking. If you are a true fan you wouldn't pick it apart too much and hope that the sequel redeems the flaws.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My grandson loves anything with angry birds written on it and this game was no different.  He loved this game.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|I love twitchtv and have become a big fan over the last month's Its low rez garbage and you can not log in, and there are limited features. On the right track make this a paid app and charge two bucks and make it what it should be.

0316228532|5.0|I truly enjoyed the characters in this book.  They were real, more real than we would like to admit.  The story lines moved along at a good clip. I had some trouble, at first, keeping the characters and various relationships straight, it was worth it in the end to pay attention.  As a social services professional, the story lines struck me as being sadly realistic.  As much as I hated that the ending was not a happy fantasy, it was true and plays out all too often in the world today.  This book explores some of the same themes as Harry Potter but in a much more mature and frank way.  It is a book I will probably read again and will recommend to anyone who asks (even those who don't ask, unfortunately for my friends).
0802473156|5.0|Gary Chapman always delivers quality. This is the book when it comes to relationship building. I highly recommend this book to all.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Last season's breakout comedy on Fox, this is a hilarious series about one woman rooming with three guys, all of whom have their own wacky quirks. Breakout performances by Max Greenfield and Jake M. Johnson round out the superb cast.
B008E77AEK|4.0|When reading 'Trojan Horse' it's apparent the writing is not of a seasoned author, but the premise of this novel is what sets it apart.  It's sci-fi (comsci-fi?) completely based in the facts of technology today; exploits of today's computer and phone technology used in international espionage and terrorism.  In this regard it reminds me of novels like William Gibson's 'Spook Country' (\\"5 minutes into the future\\") and while 'Spook Country' has the benefit of coming from a more established and talented author, I enjoyed the grounded premise of 'Trojan Horse' more.<br /><br />The first 20% of the book was extremely jarring to me though - the author often steps out of the story to explain technical concepts.  I understand why he felt the need to do this (hey, not everyone knows what DNS is) but I felt even if it dealt with technical concepts I did not understand (say medical terminology) somehow it could have been handled with more finesse.  I kept expecting a quiz at the end of the chapter!  Thankfully, Russinovich hits his stride, and by half way through, I really didn't put my Kindle down.<br /><br />Beyond the technology basis of the book, the rest is fairly typical us-versus-them, good-versus-evil, spy thriller stuff complete with a good explosion, which is all reasonably compelling.  The author's investigation of the characters' inner thought processes adds a lot to the story.<br /><br />On a side note, it was also a fairly weird experience to be using procmon and a few other tools Russinovich has produced for work related technical investigations whilst reading this novel.<br /><br />Given this is only the second novel of Russinovich's, I am definitely keen for his future works!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Who doesn't love the walking dead. If you watch it you get hooked. Has to be the most talked about show this decade.
B00ADII8YE|5.0|Holy Crap!!!  I struggled through season 2 thinking I wouldn't watch season 3, but Holy Crap!!  You think things couldn't get any better and they do!  I guess there was some character development in season 2 with some of the relationships, especially Daryl's loyalty to the group.  I think he will be conflicted but ultimately HE is gonna be the one to take his brother out.  He is gonna have to choose and he will choose the group.  This has one of the 'LOST' situations where you wonder how the heck they are gonna get out of it.  The only thing I can see taking down Woodbury is for them to round up a hord of zombies and run them into town.  Kinda a cruel way to take everyone out but hey, it's a man eat man world out there!!

We lost the first one, so we opened the second one and the quality was not the same. Open threads and seam had a small hole without any use, the pacifier had a longer nipple so we are returning the defective one and ordering two more; hopefully we will get lucky!<br /><br />Our 3 month old loves it, well he loved his first one, and wasnt that excited as the backup one felt different....

I am so excited that I just made 3 pumpkin pies that all came out with a great crust.  I borrowed the book from the library to try a couple of things and with my wonderful crust experience, I just bought the book.  I can hardly wait to try some of the other recipes that normally I would have passed over in any other book.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|The film was a Must See recommendation from friends, with the requirement that we had to first watch Captain America and Thor, first.  Both prerequisites were very good.  But the hyped Avengers was a disappointment, becuase it lacked tight plot progression and ran far too long.<br /><br />Still, Avengers has lots of good special effects, just too much for our tastes.
B009CO0SI4|5.0|I feel this album is a stronger outing then Ms. Orton's previous CD, Comfort of Strangers. While the electronica of her earliest work is missing, it has been replaced by the swirl of strings bowed and plucked. Her voice is in fine form, the vague, spacey lyrics hint at longing, love, infidelity, change. If you're a fan you won't be disappointed, lush, sweet, sad, Beth has returned.<br /> Unfortunately there are two versions of the album, the Deluxe has 3 more songs including a cover of Neil Youngs, &#34;Goin' Back&#34; which could have been written by Beth. The price difference  between the various versions on amazon was dramatic, if you can, buy the deluxe. One wonders what these record companies are thinking, calling illegal down-loaders thieves.

B003B02O14|5.0|Grisham;s books are always entertaining.  I look forward to his new books.  Havn't read The Racketeer yet.  Have ordered it.
0385535147|5.0|While I have yet to have time to read the my copy of the book, I had it sent directly to my parents.  Within 24 hours of having received the book, it had been read cover to cover.  Another sensational book!
B008HK3XKO|3.0|The problem I have with this item is that it does not stand up well. When I fold it as shown in the picture, it keeps slipping, so I have to make a couple attempts before it will stand without falling flat.
030726999X|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for at the right price and came on time.  I would recommend this item.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|&#34;Jelly&#34; is adorable. You can earn him hats, dress him up, and virtually pet him. So cute for young (and old). It's sort of a physics  game if I can stretch it that far. You have to draw the jelly lines in the exact right spot and move them left, right, up, down to get jelly to bounce exactly where you want him to in order to get his feather. The levels are fantastic as you go through different climates to get Jelly his feathers to fly, which is really all he dreams of doing. :-) Just so cute. And fun. And addictive. Well worth the money!

B0086DBE62|5.0|LOVED it. Great little story. Julia Roberts plays a great villan. Love love love the costumes and sets. Cute - funny and enjoyable movie.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Great show! Very addicting. Watched the entire season in two days. Planning on buying the rest of the seasons very soon.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Our Family enjoyed it. Even our 13 year old son. It was better than we expected it to be. Cute funny and enjoyable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You have to read this with an open mind, the story is great. This is not &#34;Mommy Porn&#34; as so many have labeled it. There is a very gooid story line and it gets wrapped up in volume three. Do not judge the characters until you have finished all three books. Enjoy!
B00973DDN2|5.0|I bought this for less than $8, a great price for an album that's got some great tracks, can't beat the value.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Really, really wanted to like this movie... The best parts are in the trailer.  I wanted to shut it off after the first 30 minutes, and I should have.  It starts a love plot and never touches it, doesn't deliver with the action, and gets ruined by Kristen Stewart... I want my money and time back.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss is a huge inspiration to me. Her courage for her sister and her strength to take care of her whole house hold after her father passed away. I've read this book many times and i love it more and more each time.
B0027P2ZWC|3.0|The sound of this musical is like a live concert, which it was.  So when listening to it at home, you can't help but hear the \\"outdoor\\"/concert sound of the recording.  I bought it coz it's an ALL-STAR cast.  I'm just not very happy w/ the \\"concert\\" sound of it.  I prefer the clearer sound of original London and Broadway recordings.  But don't get me wrong.  It's a good cd.  An All-Star cast indeed :)
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book so much, i'm an avid reader and i can usually jump right into another book, but this book took time to get over. i was completely moved by the characters. After this read, John Green is one of the first authors i recommend. This is definitely the best book Green has ever written.
0470901071|5.0|Recommended by many, and now one more endorsement. The cost of the exams requires you to take no chances and this guide delivers on preparing you for the exams.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read all three, and yes i'm ashamed. This book is the Twilight saga character for character. You can definitely tell this was a fan fiction.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|The sweetness of a serial killer continues.  You want nothing but the best for this guy, you want him to &#34;get away&#34; ...you want his life to be good, and what kind of &#34;deviant thing in me&#34; is there, that makes me glad when he finds a new kill .  Sorta like Dirty Harry, but with intelligence and stealth, minus the bang bang boombady...of Harry.<br /><br />The genius of the series has me hooked, but I make it last.  I pace myself to watch one episode a day...at night. And then it falls apart and I'm left sitting there, mind reeling at the twist thrown at Dex.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it was a bit expensive but there were so many twists i didn't know which character i wanted to come out on top. the end however was a bit disappointing. I'd recommend this book.

B009LK6JS2|4.0|this app is great but it coulb be better with more missions, more terrain, more planes and a way to tell what side of the carrier the wire is on. i hope the developers take these sugestions into the app to make it 5/5
B0078X2LKY|4.0|We also have an animated version on my iPhone, as well as the newer version with Elmo and Grover. Hope to see that version soon!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I just got my Kindle a week before Thanksgiving.  I've been playing a ton of free and demo games.  I liked a lot but couldn't pull the trigger on buying any.  Until I played this game.  It is really clever and above all fun.  The puzzles are fairly easy but well thought out.  I really liket he gameplay and it's cool using a character you have drawn.  I totally suggest buying it and it's well worth $1.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|I thought it was an excellent movie. Didn't quite know what to expect, as reviews were not exactly descriptive. A movie that shows characters who don't fit the mold, how people need to really, REALLY learn that people are unique, and develop behaviors that embrace the differences in all. Good for families to teach their kids to view differences in friends and others as OK, as a learning experience, and something to broaden their perspective. Some parents may not like the friendship that develops between the two main characters, especially if they have children in that pre-teen age range, but also to see that what adults may view as wrong, is to give too much &#34;shame&#34; to something that children don't quite have the knowledge of.
B00993FEUK|5.0|How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it/really liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />Norman Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a young boy with an unusual gift; he can see and communicate with the spirits of the deceased. This makes him a social outcast to nearly everyone, including members of his own family as they think he's just a weird kid. Although one kid in town thinks what he can do is awesome, portly optimist Neil Downe (voiced by Tucker Albrizzi). One day, Norman is approached by the town crazy, Mr. Prenderghast (voiced by John Goodman) who warns Norman of an ancient curse on the town that only Norman can stop. That's all I really wanna say in terms of the plot, as I don't feel like giving away anything else.<br /><br />This truly is one of the best animated films of 2012; really, it could be one of the best films in general of 2012, and just one of THE BEST animated films. People often forget that animation is not a genre, but a style of filmmaking. So for those that think this movie will be \\"too scary\\" for kids, then you seriously underestimate how tough kids can be. People also forget that ratings are on movies for a reason. This movie is rated PG (practically a hard PG give certain moments in the film) so you should have a general idea of what age group this movie should fall into. Personally, I think kids who are Norman's age (11 for those that don't know) and maybe even kids a couple years younger. Seriously, I saw tons of more \\"intense\\" films as a kid and they didn't traumatize me. Think about Disney for a moment; people associate it with a mystical fairy tale land of sweetness and enchantment. But then really think about how intense those movies could be. Snow White (which has the wicked queen being crushed by a rock), Cinderella (who's emotionally and physically abused by her step family), Sleeping Beauty (that features a fight with a dragon and mention to the fires of Hell!), Bambi (where a poor baby deer loses his mother), The Lion King (a lion cub's father trampled to death by a herd of wildebeests), and several others in their catalogue. Disney almost always had some pretty dark undertones. Look at classics like the Secret of NIHM or the Neverending Story. Adults forget that kids are a lot tougher than they thin, and while dark imagery may frighten a bit, once you have a triumphant end all the other bad stuff fades away. ParaNorman is such an example.<br /><br />This movie hits all the right notes. The animation is AMAZING, the voice casting is fantastic (people will also often forget that voice acting does require some talent and the ability to emote), the look of the movie has a classic horror feel to it, the comedy is funny, the horror at times actually scary, and the drama will tug at you. It also handles death very well and respectfully for the most part. The characters are also great, even some of the smaller ones. A good layer to the whole thing is how Norman interacts with his family. His sister, Courtney (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is your typical teenage girl but not overly annoying, his mother (voiced by Leslie Mann) is your typical protective mother who sticks by her son because that's what a mother does. But of all the family members, the best to me was Norman's father (voiced by Jeff Garlin) because we see that he does genuinely love his son, but at the same time is frustrated that he doesn't understand him. I can relate to that for sure, I think most can because there are those parents who get upset by their kid's strange behavior but they still want to do what they can to show they care even if they don't always go about it the right way. Of course the standout character is Neil because of his optimistic view of everything despite his various problems (like irritable bowel syndrome) and willingness to stick by Norman no matter what. John Goodman stands out tooas the crazy old bum. The moment we learn the full story of the curse is simply tragic and if you're not crying from it you'll definitely be crying on the inside.<br /><br />Personally, I don't get how anyone could rate this below 4 stars. I mean, I get that we all have our tastes and opinions, but seriously, this is by no means a bad movie, especially when compared to the dreck that passes for a lot of kids entertainment these days. This reminds me of movies I watched as a kid, back when people didn't assume kids were fragile and always needed you to hold their hands. So in conclusion, see this movie! It's an essential view for anyone who just loves a great story.as the crazy old bum.

B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Loved this movie! Always loved entertainment that showcased girl power! Also a good movie for families, especially mothers and daughters, to show each other's perspective, how that can harm relationships, but yet show that each can learn from the other, and see each other in their light, not in stereotypes.
9500426404|5.0|It brought me back to my childhood! Great work of fantasy where worlds are crated and you get to travel to all of them and wonder how they survive!
1592400876|5.0|Ms Truss has given the literary world an excellent book that delivers an important message for all would-be authors, report-writers and minute-takers. Written in an amusing yet authoritative manner, this should be prescribed reading for all scholars at secondary and higher educational levels, who are required to master the intricacies of English language punctuation.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Amazon mp3 is a really easy and great way to get music. Plus it's really affordable. Go ahead give it a try.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I do not write amazon book reviews often although I should.<br /><br />4HC is a very unique book. A lot of people bash Tim, but he really know how to \\"learn\\" and understand things. Not many people can say that. I am impressed by the way so much information is presented so well. Congrats to the author and also the person who designed the layout of this book. I am currently reading this on iPad (Kindle app) and it look gorgeous. Eagerly awaiting my hardcover down here in Santiago, Chile. Tim come down here and do a 4HC tour.<br /><br />I have never taken so many notes within the first 100-pgs of a book. I am very excited to read the rest of it and I am sure I am gonna enjoy it.<br /><br />Cheers.

B009XY97VC|5.0|I have purchased all previous albums by Two Steps From Hell, but this one takes the cake. I always put this music on at the gym. It's a perfect mix of pulse-pounding epics and emotive scores. If you love great epic music, you'll love this album.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|I can't add to anything that others have already said. This is EPIC! If you are a Zeppelin fan, GET THIS! This DVD (no matter how bad the editing may be) was truly an incredible experience for me. The only thing better for me at this point would be to have attended a live show. Oh, how I wish!<br /><br />Now, quit reading the reviews and JUST BUY IT ALREADY!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Not a lot of new information on NDE here.  What is new is the prospective it comes from.  The doctor did an excellent job of explaning the science behind how somethings like this can occur.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a fun game and its pretty addicting.  a fun way to pass the time.  i like the little clips they play at the movie theater.  wish there was a way to get more silver coins tho.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|But, agruably one of the best marketeers of this era.  He had great vision and an uncompromising, non-wavering search for the best product.  Didn't chase marketshare - sought best products.  I'm going to buy a MAC the next time I buy a computer.

B0098WWEH8|5.0|I enjoyed this album much more than Grizzly Bear's first album, and found myself listening to it on repeat for several weeks after I purchased it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I started reading this book because it was recommended by several coworkers. At first, I wasn't at all sure if this was a book for me. But, I am glad that I kept with it. It really makes a person think...not to mention, given a new meaning to, \\"our children are our future\\".<br /><br />I would recommend this book to others.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|With all the pre release pub, it didn't live up to its predecessors. Slow moving at first. Effects were pedestrian. Plotlines muddled. It began as Star Trek, ended as Halloween. Even the 3D was nothing special.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|works well and sharpens my knives well. i am either using the serrated sharpener wrong or it just doesn't work well, my guess is operator error lol
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Get the app!<br />It's great for young children to bronies to non bronies. I think anyone could enjoy this game. It's free. You can purchase gems to buy things in-game. But you don't have to because as you level up you will get one once in a while. I think this game is great and anyone could enjoy it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Other 5-star reviewers are right. This won't disappoint. Don't shy away if you're an amateur.  I am not in perfect shape and even the first (easiest) workout is customizable.
0547884591|5.0|I'm still working my way through this book (you actually cook things over the course of weeks/months and it's 600+ pages long), but it's great so far and will continue to be I'm sure. It is very well put together, has tons of great media to keep you interested and involved, and is packed with lots of useful tips and tricks of the trade. Many of which I've already used (ie roll a lemon before you squeeze it; most things can be cooked at 375 degrees).<br /><br />My girlfriend and I hate to cook and aren't good at it, but we know its a key ingredient of having a healthly lifestyle. Plus it makes you feel much more self-sufficient, so this book came at a perfect time.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Tim's previous work, and price wasn't a consideration when I bought it since I would have paid double to get it, but I do want to make a mention of it. It's hard to believe a book this large, this in color, and this detailed retails this low. I don't know of any book near this price point that can come close to it's utility.<br /><br />Highly recommend for anyone thinking they want to get on track for 2013.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book One left me upset by the ending.  However, Book Two hooked my interest, and I was in it for the long<br />haul!  The mystery of Christian's past intrigued me, and the suspense grew as we were offered a glimpse into<br />his upbringing, his passion, his intensity and cruel, dark side.  Must be true, that the love of a good woman can rescue and change any man!  I enjoyed this book, but it must be read as a trilogy, or it's like putting a jigsaw together with missing pieces to the puzzle.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Gladiator is one of the greatest action movies of all time.<br /><br />The acting is incredible, and received multiple Academy Awards. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are absolutely amazing.<br />The action is great. It excites you and draws you in, and has the highest quality.<br />The plot is perfect. From general to slave to gladiator, all on a great revenge plot. Perfect.<br /><br />If you like action movies, historical movies, or nearly-perfect movies, you must watch Gladiator.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The first book ended badly, but I was delighted to discover that it was part of a trilogy...so I read the 2nd and<br />3rd, and each one got better and more interesting.  And who doesn't like a happy ending?  Actually, I felt that<br />I knew the characters so well by the 3rd book, that I actually missed them when the book ended.  I felt that I<br />had lost 2 close friends!  I would love to see a Fifty Shades MOVIE!  I'd be the first in line!  All in all, I felt it was a good read, it held my interest, and the sex segments deserved an Olympic God Medal for endurance...whew!
B00003CXRM|5.0|If you like the Coen brothers, you must see this movie.<br />If you like well-done, situational comedy, or classic-feeling comedy, you must see this movie.<br />If you like retellings of The Odyssey, you must see this movie.<br /><br />Overall, a different, but a great movie.

3421044309|4.0|Germany is now not remotely as divided as the US any more. While American rifts go much too deep for comfort and far exceed healthy levels of conflict in debate, German disagreements between political camps have often been of the not so exciting kind. You could also call that more civilized.<br /><br />The book that I `review' here caused a heated controversy in Germany. Published in 2010, it achieved bestseller status and divided the population across party lines. Many of its supporters are right-wingers and populists, many of its critics are from the 'pro multi-culti' camp. But the front lines are not so easily demarcated. The book criticizes the current government as well as previous governments. The author was threatened with expulsion from the Social Democratic Party for his opinions. He seems to have a fairly broad backing in the population, though none of the important parties wants to support it.<br />Angela Merkel put her foot into it when she stated publicly that the book was not helpful, though she admitted that she had not read it.<br /><br />The author was a top state banker and a state politician (on the `Land' level, as finance senator in Berlin). He is not a diplomatic talent, but a rather dry and meticulous personality, with a certain tendency to unnerve people. The reception of his book has seen a surprising amount of misrepresentation and unfair attacks. It is partly his own fault, as he seems to go fishing for opportunities to provoke. I was prepared to be negative, but found the book better than expected. More rational, more logical, more convincing. Quite improvable though.<br /><br />What is it about? German population trends and long term international competitiveness. As the title says, the author thinks that the country is 'doing away with itself' by not paying attention to the shrinking of its educated population and the growth of a parasitic underclass, consisting of immigrants as well as the indigenous 'precariat', ie the people who are not willing to play by the normal rules of society, but subsist on welfare and reject education. Immigrants from some parts of the world (mainly Turkey and Near East) are seen as abusing the German welfare state, which is facilitated by failed immigration and welfare policies.<br />The author rejects negligent tolerance towards political Islam and takes a position of secular enlightenment. He accepts the label  `liberal fundamentalist', but is accused by many of being a racist. I can't find fault with his basic position.not willing to play by the normal rules of society, but subsist on welfare and reject education.

0865479410|4.0|I am a sucker. Feature a writer on National Public Radio, and the interview is mildly entertaining, I will buy the book. I will also probably read it -- the only question remaining: will I actually like it?<br /><br />The Antidote, for sure, is personally fascinating. I abhor positive thinking, gravitating instead toward reality. But I didn't come by this easily. In my early 20's, I became obsessed with all manner of self help, positive thinking and new age spirituality. I devoured (embarrassing) self help books, feeling temporarily inspired by them while making feeble attempts to put the words into practice. Inevitably, I'd feel like a failure for not being able to be perfect -- or even slightly \\"better\\" than I was before; I'd feel consumed with anger and resentment, too, that my problems didn't magically go away; that life wasn't easier. It took me a LONG TIME to realize that my faux spirituality was primarily the cause of my dissatisfaction and pain.<br /><br />My actual problems were far less annoying than the books I was reading to solve them.<br /><br />I wish I'd read The Antidote 15 years ago.<br /><br />The Antidote travels familiar -- to me, a junkie, at least -- terrain. If you've ever read a book on buddhism (through a pop culture lens), for instance, much of this won't be new: accept life as it is. But the context will; the author blends storytelling, cutting edge research, personal anecdote and wry humor into this compelling case for what he refers to as the negative path; the wisdom of the Stoics as a sane approach to life.<br /><br />I am torn as to how many stars to offer; for whatever reason, I wasn't in love with the book as a whole. The author is certainly a talented writer, but I felt like the book went on and on. And on. This kind of thing, yes, is highly subjective, so take it with a grain of salt. To me, this book would have been a lot better had it been a lot shorter. I often feel this way about non-fiction books -- that there's a quota to fill. What's wrong with lean and mean?<br /><br />(OK, OK: the book is not actually that long, so maybe it's my attention span).<br /><br />It also bears mentioning that reading The Antidote is not actually the antidote for, really, anything: you actually have to live -- which means accepting that life is hard and messy and sometimes ugly and awful; it means not constantly trying to escape it.<br /><br />But if you're obsessed with The Secret, then you need this book. The Secret will not-so-secretly let you down, again and again. The Antidote contains actual valuable advice: there are no shortcuts, magical thinking is useless and, my favorite: a little negativity will make us happier.ill.

B002JH3TW8|5.0|Works great to adapt my newer laptop to older drives, or enables me to connect a few in series, and easily transfer data from older to new drives.
B000641D2Y|5.0|The First and Second Home Alone movies are so fantastic! i love to watch these every year! The cast is great and the movies are fun for the whole family!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My whole family enjoyed the movie.  Lots of good laughs, very visually appealing.  Didn't have the emotional depth it could have.  The &#34;dark bear&#34; was very scary, partly BECAUSE of the visual intensity.  My eight-year-old girls were a little overwhelmed by that part.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I don't really know what I was expecting with this movie but it wasn't the best I have seen or the worst. Charlize Theron was awesome in it! I was very impressed with her acting. She definitely carried the movie. But otherwise it didn't really hold my attention.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It was a fun game. I loved the game it was very fun.Minecraft is the most fun thing ever.  :)
1932100660|5.0|I had been considering going vegan for many reasons. I am a scientist so I needed the facts - I had seen Dr. Campbell speak and wanted to read in depth about his study. This book has changed so much about me and my eating habits. It is a wealth of information! I highly recommend this book!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Good quality video and cheap price. I would recommend this movie to others. I would also recommend prime to everyone out there!
1575666286|5.0|This book is a great reference book! I read it cover to cover and learned so much from it! I don't need to go full out on this therapy but I do detox regularly and this book has some great pointers on it!
B0087ITC56|3.0|The title is a little misleading. This is a story about an alcoholic substance abuser (Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker) who has yet to come to terms with his problem. The flight incident happens early in the film while the rest of the film documents Whip's denial of his problems. What muddies the water is that Whip, while drunk, is a better pilot than anyone is sober.<br /><br />John Goodman provided the comedy relief for the film. I wish there had been more of him in the film. Nadine Velazquez provides the full frontal nude scene at the beginning of the feature.<br /><br />Denzel Washington creates a good character, but the plot was weak. It wasn't a flight film. And as far as a man coming to terms with his alcoholism, it didn't exactly grab me. There was some questions involving Denzel's secular views vs. the religious views of those around him. The co-pilot's wife caused laughter believing the accident was God's will.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs, nudity, no sex.

B006FO3ERQ|4.0|The characters in this book come alive through the memory of an older man telling you the story of his starcrossed youth, from what he recalls was the youth's perspective. There is a cultural picture of post WW 2 America, and major changes are brewing in his family where he is a fraternal twin, soon to lose his parents to jail, and be ripped into a life in  a Canadian backwater hotel . There is danger, and survival and secrets in the book which are resolved in the telling.
B0025KVLT2|1.0|tThis album is another rip off....It contains a mini documentry....That is all....I travel to Asia often...I will now buy a counterfit copy.<br />Amazon why are you selling this rip off
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This novel was recommended to me from a friend that was in a book club with me some years ago.  The story line captured me from the beginning, and I did not want to put it down as it delved into the character so well.  The early life experiences of the main character shaped the emotional side of her life (as it does for many) and it was both frustrating as well as exhilarating to read of her journey.  To introduce the emotional definition of flowers as a form of therapy was brilliant on the part of writer Vanessa Diffenbaugh.  Do not pass this one up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love the big easy to see keyboard.<br />would recommend this app to everyone.<br />easy to use and a wonderful addition to help when I need it.<br />thank you
B003VS0CX8|3.0|I think I was so mesmerized at the great value of this combo pack that I failed to realize that the DVD portion does not included commentary. With that being my fault for oversight, it is still a bummer that the DVD doesn't come with good features like the BlueRay does. Great movie and great quality though!

B005HJWWW8|1.0|I bought this for use with a set of Beyerdynamic headphones. It had been plugged in to my Macbook Air as well as my Galaxy Nexus phone. It was plugged in to power most of the time, primarily purchased to drive 250 ohm headphones.<br /><br />The build quality seems off. The plastic housing seemed to have been through some heat causing the plastic to slightly deform. The device worked, however, so I used it.<br /><br />I did not use any of the special pre-amp EQ settings. I didn't like it jacking with the audio as I prefer my source to handle this. I was a little confused about the pre-amp EQ setting light at first as it wasn't all that clear where to find this (I was watching the front of the device, not the back, and expecting the LED in the corner to change).<br /><br />The device was actually pretty easy to use, and the clip made it easy to wear when plugged in to my phone.<br /><br />I was surprised to find the quality of the audio amplified was pretty good for what seemed like a cheap compact amp. It drove my 250 ohm headphones quite well. I was prepared to give this a 5 star review for the performance I got out of it at the price that I paid.<br /><br />However, after just over a month of use, it stopped powering on altogether. I don't know if I have a rare bad device (it gets reviewed so well...maybe premature reviews before others had died?), if it suffered heat damage during production or shipping (hence the slightly deformed plastic, it never got hot while being used), or if I was exceeding its specs with the source or the headphones (no limitations listed).
B003XVYLDU|5.0|A gentle and tragic and imaginative and very, very humane prose poem on the tragedy of war, focusing on the devastation of Dresden by firebombing. Vonnegut has distinctive voice. Because he uses whimisical sci-fi fantasies to balance the terror and agony of his main subject, this is often misunderstood as a science fiction book. It is a major work of serious fiction. A great novel.
0547884591|5.0|Life is filled with too many straight line processes, best practices, narrow minded solutions and short sighted perspectives. But thankfully, Tim has once again dug another path for us to follow. Filled with his usual creativity and unique strategies.<br /><br />A great read for everyone who enjoys an entertaining approach to experiencing life in a new light.
B005V4FJC4|2.0|I liked but never &#34;loved&#34; several of the songs but hated this rendition of &#34;Baby, its cold outside&#34;. Loved both versions in the movie Elf so I was very disappointed with this rushed version.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|after I had seen it in the movie and it was even cheesier on a small screen without the effects.  Still liked the costumes, and of Course Charlize Theron is great.  But yawn...
B00271SFB6|5.0|Best Bond character yet! Still like the old 007 movies, but Daniel Craig makes it much more exciting, realistic and suave.

B009RI4ZKC|1.0|I fell asleep about halfway through while watching it !  I thought it would be better based on the other reviews
B0051RP4DA|5.0|Sometimes an entire album is great. It's simple and timeless. Mostly i figure musician are full of themselves when they release an album like this, but I would like to thank Eddie Vedder for this. Full of himself or no, this is greatness.

1476715904|5.0|I choose to read books by emerging authors.  I was pleasantly surprised by Colleen Hoover's story and style of writing.  I was immediately engaged in this book and the end of the chapters lead me to want to read on.....That's when you know reading a great book.  Well done, Colleen....Thank you for creating captivating characters with a great story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thought all the 5 star ratings were a fluke.  I held this in my wish list and kept passing over it.  When it was my turn in my book club I put this up for vote and it won. I'm the only sci-fi reader in the group so I was a little nervous, but they all loved it.  Most of them even purchased First Shift on their own!  Stop wondering if it's worth it and just buy it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This novel kept my interest throughout.  Just when I thought I had it figured out, a surprise awaited.  An excellent read.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|The download was quick and easy. It's a good book to read. I've already told several of my friends, I recommend it to anyone.

B00756GKBA|5.0|Don't listen to bad reviews , it's sad that anyone can writte a review, even if they haven't boughten the album. They are all gaga fans.<br /><br />You may not know many of the tracks because they are not played in the radio but this album is so good because it is a variety of different types of music for every fan.<br />My favorites are: girl gone wild, gang bang, masterpiece ( beautiful ballade), falling free( ballade), giv me all ur luvin remix version ( only available on deluxe album), some girls, love spent, turn up the radio, best friend ( this one takes time for you to catch it, but its a<br />Nice song) I'm addicted!<br />I can't stop lisenting this album.<br />THANKS Madonna!
B00005JNS0|2.0|This is a very long one note joke. Lighting Mcqueen is not that interesting. Most of the cast are stereotypes. The moral is phoned in right from the start. Worst of all,the story itself is very predictable. Surf's Up would do a similar story the very next year after this was made. The A+ moments are the first-rate animation,the amazing race scenes and the crash scenes. I'll give them that. I give this film a 3 out of 10.
159420411X|5.0|As someone who deals with Bayesian methods all the time, this book is spot on. It is very well written and shows, through examples, all the nuances that can go into prediction tasks. I feel that I have to further emphasize the clarity of the writing, as not many books aimed at non-academics do such a great job emphasizing important points simply without sacrificing accuracy.

B00A3YTC6Q|1.0|This movie sucks! It was poorly written and made to attract idiot by getting quote on quote \\"hot\\" people who could not act if there life depended on it. There is no art to this movie unlike the first and second ones. This was a waste of time and money. And what the jack is up with the cover photo. And there was too many celebrities and bad music. The first and second movie was about art, dancing, love and life this movie is about making profit from mindless drones.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|If you would like to learn how to inject peace into a chaotic life this is the book to do it. Easy read but requires effort to put into practice. You don't get something for nothing. Sometimes I practice a little a lot.  One, two, three minutes at a time throughout the day. Sometimes I have the time for a longer meditation. It's all good.<br /><br />If you have ever given thought to meditation I recommend this book. Easy to read, clear instructions, and a gift that keeps giving.
1439102813|5.0|This was suggested to me by several friends and relatives because my mother suffers from early onset dementia.  I found it hard to put down.

Somewhat sad of course because of the subject matter, but still enjoyable.  i've passed it on to other friends who have family members with similar diagnosis.

B00006I53S|4.0|I bought this lens about 1 year ago, together with a new Canon Rebel T3i.<br />This being my first DSLR, I decided to buy close to the entry level. However, I wanted to buy a lens that could last me longer than the camera. I can see myself upgrading to a full frame later on; I didn't want to invest too much in EF-S lenses.<br />I would call myself an experienced amateur. I took about 2,500 photos so far, both outdoor and indoor.<br />Here is what I liked:<br />  - it is an excellent all-around lens. I keep it mounted most of the times. The focal range on a cropped sensor corresponds to 45-215, which is great for most common situations<br />  - picture quality is generally very good for someone at my level<br />  - price was very attractive for a lens with this focal range<br />  - weight and length are tolerable for everyday use<br />Some negatives:<br />  - the lens extends when facing down. This makes it less compact and a bit less convenient to carry than I'd like<br />  - 'tolerable' weight means it may still be too heavy for some<br />  - 28mm on a T3i doesn't cover the wide end adequately; leaves me wanting for a wider lens<br />  - you almost always need flash indoor; F3.5 at 28mm is not nearly enough for shooting in natural light<br /><br />The last point is really evident when you compare its performance to the EF 50mm f/1.8 II, a very cheap prime I bought a few months later. I am annoyed by the plastic feel of the 50mm, but f/1.8 allows me to take great pictures in low light.<br /><br />Overall I recommend the EF 28-135mm IS USM. Just make sure you can live with the shortcomings listed above.

B009NQKXYK|5.0|Great addition to the Alien Universe -- great acting, great visuals.  Definitely one you will want to watch a few times.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Everyone needs to sit down and watch this movie at least ones. How much are you willing to give up?
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I know it's only a step passed Angry Birds Space, but the way they've included the Star Wars story line as well as given you progressive abilities with the characters (like light sabers and blasters) is a lot of fun and adds to the strategic puzzle of all the levels. If you're an Angry Birds fan and a Star Wars fan, then you'll probably enjoy this mash-up.
0395389496|5.0|I wasn't expecting the cd to come with the book so that was a very pleasant surprise. This book is made with quality and is made to last for years. Can't wait to watch my nephews open theirs on Christmas Eve!
B005NKGEP2|3.0|This is not bad book but it's messy. It jumping all the time in time and place, that's annoying. I am from Europe and most of these places are familiar. There is plenty of facts etc. so it's easy to notice that writer has been even done really good background check or visited on sites in the book. We are expat family ourselves so I was surprising first how accurate he can write from expats normal daily life.<br /><br />Anyway, this is good reading but you really need to pick it up every night. It will not happens automatically (like in cases where book is really interesting)
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I agree with many other reviews that noted this is the most &#34;Disneyfied&#34; of the Pixar movies, and much for the worse. The story is clich&eacute;d and lacks the genuinely touching moments that characterize the best Pixar movies (e.g. Wall*E's pining for Eva and the opening scenes of UP). There is a mildly feminist, anti-tradition message to the movie, but mostly it's the standard teenage rebellion story (with happy ending). Not recommended except the the visual effects.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I don't normally read this type of litterature, but it was recommended by my son. Pleasantly surprised is the best word I can think of. Alot of details regarding weapons and strategy, but the story kept things moving along and kept it interesting.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|With an action cast as magnificent as they had in this film, and obviously high budget, there is literally no excuse why every scene shouldn't kick major ass and leave you totally satisfied. Unfortunately the opposite happened-- Every scene seemed to zoom by, without any truly &#34;cinematic&#34; moments that are memorable. Every amazing introduction of each new character was less than lackluster, and the action wasn't anything that we haven't seen before.<br />To have Jean Claude VanDamme as the bad guy was the coolest thing ever, and the actual movie failed to live up to that premise.<br />As a side note, I'm also really tired of looking at CG blood explosions. It looks fake, it's always over the top, and never adds to the scene. The action giants in this film came up in an era of real pyrotechnics and squibs, and the action in those films is still better.
0547884591|5.0|Having been a loyal Ferriss fan since 4HWW, it was a given that I would read this latest installment in the 4hr series, although 4HC isn't exactly just another installment. Instead, Ferriss takes the maverick philosophy that made 4HWW & 4HB so unique, zooms out, and shares an aerial view of how to apply this philosophy to anything. It's the core of the first two books, with a heck of a lot more added. Haven't finished reading the 600+ pages just yet; I'm excited to take it all in over the holidays. I guess some might find the length a bit tedious. I, on the other hand, feel just like my favorite canceled TV show just released six new seasons. Deeply satisfying so far.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good story line, and written well. It shows how wealth can affect a person and how child abuse can go undetected
B007SGM084|5.0|This was something different for a change, it kept me interested and wanting to keep reading!  The first book was pretty good, but the second book was excellent and made me look forward to the third and final book.  Even in Vegas at the pool all you saw was women reading the books with the black covers!!  I hope there are more books coming in this series!
B008RZF1UO|5.0|Although I will miss Khan, the new singer is great for Kamelot.  I love that the album has a story behind it.  The music flows well and sounds amazing.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves this type of music!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Really loved it.  John Green deserves infinite pizzas for being such an excellent author.  That, it would appear, is all.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I settled on a 4 star rating because i thought it was ok, but my husband loved it.  There was a lot of potential in this movie to be amazing, but it just wasn't there for me.  If you don't have any expectations of the movie give it a try, you'll like it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Truly exceptional book.  I highly recommend reading it; it may well change your life.  Infinite pizzas to John Green.  Aye.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I recently got this game (Love it by the way) for the free version and a saw on youtube that it has had a update and my kindle fire says there is not a update for it so is there updates for the free version or do I have to wait?

I just made the basic chocolate cupcake with cream cheese frosting...soooo good. the cupcakes came out so fluffy and I couldn't stop eating the frosting D:<br /><br />anyway, lots of nice pictures, almost for every recipe. a bunch of resources in the back and tips in the front. the only way this could be better was if it provided nutritional data for the completed cupcake.<br /><br />I'm definitely gonna use this a lot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great conclusion. Hot! More dramatic and you finally understand why Christian is Christian. Ana and Christian needed this ending. But will admit it took me a little longer to finish than the first two.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I was concerned going in that I wouldn't love this Reacher novel.. and even a good friend warned me &#34;it really drags on..&#34;; needless to say I went in expecting the worst.<br /><br />Couldn't have been happier.  What some perceive as &#34;slow&#34; just builds more suspense.  Those who get impatient really need to stick with it.<br /><br />Now I'm left waiting on Lee Child to get with the program by:<br />1) writing me a new Reacher novel; and<br />2) sorting out that Tom Cruise in no way shape or form matches Jack Reacher, so I hope you can at least get it right on the second film.<br /><br />And Lee, if you're reading this and need the opinions of your target demographic, well, by all means, give me a shout, we'll chat.

145162607X|4.0|This book was my first foray into Gregory's novels about The Cousins' War. Although I did enjoy my journey into the life of Anne I will say that perhaps I should have read some of the other novels first.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter is the story of Anne and her sister Isabel, daughters of Richard of Warwick who becomes known as The Kingmaker. Stories around the kingdom hold that no man can hold the throne unless Lord Warwick says so. But he may have finally met his match as Edward York, his own protege, is placed on the throne. Immediately Edward disobeys the orders of the Kingmaker and his actions, along with the actions of his lovely bride, Elizabeth Woodville, result in a war that is fought in open battle and behind closed doors.<br /><br />While their father is playing at ruling England, Anne and Isabelle find themselves being used as his pawns, often sacrificed for a larger reward. Will either of them finally achieve their father ultimate goal of having one of their children as the heir to throne?<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of the youngest daughter, Anne who finds herself at the behest of the men who surround her. In her world she is surrounded by constant plotting and scheming as everyone tries to claim the throne for their own. From the time of her birth to the time of her death Anne can never quite say who is truly her friend and who is just trying to manipulate her.<br /><br />The novel has many fine qualities: the development of Anne herself being at the top of the list. Although she too often finds herself in the wrong place surrounded by the wrong people, Anne remains a likable leading lady who is doing the best she can to survive. The book is well paced and well written which is always a positive. Just when I'd start to get a bit bored something would come along and grab my attention again.<br /><br />I will say that the book is not without its flaws but I think that may be my own fault seeing as how I jumped into this book without reading any of the others from Gregory. I never quite knew how to take many of the characters because they were other introduced to me through the eyes of Anne. Being as how she was very biased in much of her thinking I started to hate some characters and later found myself wondering if I should like them. There were others that seems to be good people but then some odd bit of news made me wonder if they weren't lying to her all along. It was very hard to discern how I was supposed to feel about people like the Queen and George and especially Richard towards the end. And at one point during the novel Gregory made a line that the Queen had known about one of Richard's actions all along. This was never further discussed in this book but I'm assuming this was a reference to one of the other novels.<br /><br />I suppose if I read the other book I'd be able to gain a better perspective on the true nature of the players in this game for the throne. This isn't reflecting poorly on the author at all, in fact it made me want to read the books better to understand the truth behind the real Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Anjou.hout reading any of the others from Gregory. I never quite knew how to take many of the characters because they were other introduced to me through the eyes of Anne. Being as how she was very biased in much of her thinking I started to hate some characters and later found myself wondering if I should like them. There were others that seems to be good people but then some odd bit of news made me wonder if they weren't lying to her all along.

And at one point during the novel Gregory made a line that the Queen had known about one of Richard's actions all along. This was never further discussed in this book but I'm assuming this was a reference to one of the other novels.<br /><br />I suppose if I read the other book I'd be able to gain a better perspective on the true nature of the players in this game for the throne. This isn't reflecting poorly on the author at all, in fact it made me want to read the books better to understand the truth behind the real Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret Anjou.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game! The graphics and interface are flawless and you don't have to spend any money to enjoy it. You also don't have to bug all your friends about being your &quot;neighbor&quot;. Great for all ages.
1401322786|3.0|This is a 3.5 star review for me.<br /><br />I bought the book via my kindle and read it very quickly, it's a short novel with easy language so I was finished in just a few hours.<br /><br />The book is about 3 people: Dor (a prehistoric man who discovered time and is now being punished for it), Sarah (an overweight high school student with no friends), and Victor (a wealthy businessman who is dying from cancer).<br /><br />The story of Dor happens to be the only one I really liked. Sarah's story was so predictably cliche that I couldn't help rolling my eyes even as he describes her anguish. Victor's story was also supremely overwrought with cliches (except for the story of his future which I found extremely intriguing). Many of the scenes were well written, particularly the story of how Dor became imprisoned, but others were a bit confusing in nature (i.e. the whole hour glass scene towards the end with all 3 characters, I wasn't able to picture their movements).<br /><br />Overall the moral of this book may be hokey and overly sentimental but it was told in an novel way (pardon the pun). I have been an Albom fan for quite some time but this didn't really come off like the Albom of past novels. Not sure if that's a bad thing per se but not what I expect when I pick up one of his books. I won't pretend I was particularly impressed but I'd still recommend this to friends just because the concept was unique.
6302158095|5.0|This is quite possibly the greatest Disney animated feature ever made. It was made it 1940 and has no sound in it.
0061474355|5.0|I read this book in my Children's Literature class during college and fell in love with the story. While we read many books, this was the only book that got me to the store to buy the others in the series. Such a wonderful series. The author's writing and descriptions of Sabriel's world is outstanding and pulls the reader into the story from the start. If you're looking for a book that you will read over and over again, look no further! Sabriel is that book!
1451695195|5.0|This book was written for the average reader to understand even though the author is a Neurosurgeon.  It was a very quick read.<br />It provided a different way to think about the afterlife.  I happened to see the interview with Dr. Eben Alexander on the Dr. Oz Show.  It was interesting to see the spirit shining in him today after his experience!
B008NW67E0|5.0|love the music,  would travel some distance to see in person.<br />Mumford and Sons makes you want to dance.  i love the love songs.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|I bought two of these Beatles box sets in hopes of putting one away for future generations to enjoy.  I am an avid vinyl collector / enthusiast borderline audiophile.  I know my way around my turntable and currently running an older kenwood with an audio technica cartridge.  Trust me when I say; my geometry on my table is correct in every way.  I keep my styluses clean and replace them every so often; I am also a firm believer in a wet wash record system and I wash everything new and old before it hits my turntable for the first time.  Sometimes things get washed multiple times if I still see pressing oil or debris on new records after the first run through.<br /><br />I just want to clarify that I know my vinyl and am far from an amateur.  However after cleaning these records and listening to them in order most of the good ones sounded excellent.  I heard details that I never heard on any Beatles album bfore.  However, in the first boxset I had 8 defective records out of the 16.  The 2nd box I planned on checking the original 8 from the first box and try to make one good set.  I did not touch the other 8 albums just the 8 I found bad from the first box.  Out of that I had 5 bad ones.  Either with strings of pearls; scuffs; sounds like a sand storm or skips in the vinyl pressing itself.<br /><br />So I contacted amazon and told them about how dissatisfied; I was with the purchase and I told them I wanted one box replaced and the other box I wanted refunded.  They did exactly what I asked and quickly shipped a replacement.  Tonight the third box showed up and I thought let me check the 5 that were bad from my 2nd box and see if I can get a full box.  Nope not possible because I found 4 defects and I tried to play the abbey road lp and it sounded like a sand storm.<br /><br />This set is entirely to expensive for the vinyl to be sub-par.  I have better finds in the thrift stores for .25 to a dollar.  These records are not as clear as they should be when you listen to one of the defective pressing.  I was extremely impressed with the first few before i got to the bad ones.  Please Please Me; With the Beatles; and Hard Days Night were out standing as was the help album.<br /><br />However it was all down hill from there from the audio perspective.<br /><br />The jackets and sleeves were top notch the art work is amazing and the fact that they ship all the records in anti-static sleeves is a nice touch.  But as impressive as this box maybe if the audio is crap then I am sorry I can't be proud owner of this set.  I won't be trying the mono releases either; I always enjoyed the stereo releases and I am sorry but Apple missed there mark.  I really wanted this set to be great; I had been waiting patiently for this set to arrive since the 2009 Stereo remixes.<br /><br />With all this being said the third box is also being returned since it is below my standards; I don't think I will get another chance to buy new Beatles vinyl but whats the point if you can't enjoy it the way you should be able too.one of the defective pressing.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|I expected just your typical hero beats up bad guys, but I was surprised with a plot that has left me wanting to see more.  I curious and anxious to what comes next.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I have nothing negative to say about this movie.  A must see if you like action.  You don't need to be a big comic book guy or have seen any of the other movies with these superheros (Although I'd recommend the Iron Man movies) to enjoy this movie.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Superior fantasy fiction which maintains the high quality of the 1st book in the series. I thoroughly recommend it. Surprisingly good.
B0049VZ222|5.0|unless you're really freaked out by zombies (which I am), just watch this show.  Two days after buying season 1, you'll buy season 2.<br /><br />*I don't understand, however, why they can steal and wreck really nice cars, but they drive around full-time in cars that keep breaking down and they can't find parts.
0547884591|5.0|This book is a concentrated dosis of Pura Vida. Avoid reading it at your own risk.<br />But Could you like Star Wars and not watch the trilogy.?

B008QTVNUI|4.0|I'm late to the Homeland 'game' and am just now watching.  I would have given it a perfect score if not for the last episode where I would have been more impressed had the bad-guy done what he was intending to do.  Otherwise, a pretty riveting set of episodes and I'll buy season two when it's available.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|This is basically an 80s horror flick with the wolves playing the role as the killer.  Amazing how they can run so fast in the deep snow, yet the humans are falling over themselves trying to get away.  Don't waste your time on this.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I was surprised how much I liked this movie.  Lost of action, funny and there are some clever sub-plots.  It reminded me of the first Star Wars.  It wasn't what I expected....pleasantly surprised.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Saw Il Divo live in Orlando on their Wicked Game tour.  The show was awesome and reliving it through this CD is even more awesome.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I always enjoy reading NDE testimonials.  I would have gone 5 stars but sometimes the medical info was a little boring, probably cause I didn't really understand it.  But overall I would recommend this book.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Tried it for about 15 min. and then deleted it. Just wasn't that easy to navigate through it. Wife wasn't that impressed with it. Sorry.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved how the story ended. Only criticism would be that through the entire series you get to see how Ana helps Christian through his issues, most importantly his mother, but it jumps to a resolution at the end of the book that you don't get to read about. I would not say that this detracts from the book in ANY way. I personally really enjoyed how they worked things out and came to understand each other and wished that this piece would have been developed upon. I'm trying not to spoil it for anyone. Enjoy!
0811876373|5.0|This book was AMAZING. I decided to start doing cake pops after I had a friend that made them and they were delicious. Last week I just made a batch of cake pops for my daughter's first birthday and they came out DELICIOUS and its all thanks to the tips I got from this book. Everything from crumbling the cake down to decorating. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have some fun baking!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Even though there was a lot if talk about this book I could have never lived up to how fun this book was to read. Yes you get your fantasy kicks but the development of the characters is such a better reason to read this series.
B0095R64AO|4.0|I was not expecting to like this movie! I downloaded it to watch on a recent plane ride & was pleasantly surprised, plus a little embarrassed when I caught myself laughing out loud a few times. It was probably 10-15 minutes longer than it needed to be, but the writing was witty & not as much a &#34;chic flick&#34; as I expected. I've actually recommended it to a few guys, since I thought a lot of the humor was very guy-friendly. Great surprise, I'm glad I gave it a chance.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You can't stop after the first book. The scenarios, although would most likely never be something any one would encounter, were so engaging you feel like you are an active participant in the room.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is very Entertaining and I will probably buy full version.  My kids love it and got me to try it.
B007JNWJMI|5.0|I really love this app. Great to give a special touch to those pics you love but would look better with a filter.  I enjoy taking pictures but when I want to share this is the app I want to use. So far worth the money ... Now it's in my top 5 apps.<br />It has a time bar so you can choose filters by year. Pretty awesome.<br />realmente me encanta. Es genial para darle un toque especial a esas fotos que tanto te gustan pero que lucirían mejor con un filtro. Me gusta tomar fotos y cuando las voy a compartir esta es la aplicación que uso. Hasta ahora ha valido el dinero pagado... Está en mi top 5.<br />Tiene una barra de tiempo que da opciones de filtro por año. Bastante chiva (chevere, tuanis, cool, buena onda)<br />:)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 does not lack Walker action and the story line continues to surprise. Say good bye to some favorite characters and welcome some new and old ones.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My kids love this game. It makes them think and its totally cute. If you love Angry Birds you will enjoy this game.
B00684J49U|5.0|I laughed & I cried.  It was awesome!  I received the DVD's very quickly and watched the whole season in a few sittings.  I'll be sad when the shows ends.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire and I followed all recommended steps to get it to print, and it wouldn't work.
B007MDB71O|4.0|This movie was pretty awesome. It's a movie appropriate for all ages. John Cater would make a great Christmas gift.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book.  I would highly recommend for those who prefer a gripping, unforgettable, &#34;realistic&#34; view of the zombie apocalypse.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|very good must have on any mobile device. facebook twitter r the best features. needs more India specific feeds. thanks
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie. The family loved it. My daughter did get scared during the fight scenes. Probably not such a great movie for kids age 5 and under.
B0092W2GSG|5.0|I really don't understand why this band doesn't get more respect. This release illustrates their continuous growth over the years and positions them in a rather unique niche in the music world.
B007MG360G|3.0|It wasn't  Awesome cause, I spent money for only like two hours worth of making new animals and just to say when you mix whale with shark you get MobyDick instead of whale sari its not right but just don spend your money ok people? Now have fun with the normal version. Oh one last thing! Use your computer to play a game called Animal Jam. When you play you can talk to others make friends and more! NOTE Animal Jam if for KIDS ONLY no adults the HQ will catch you and send to police department so play with KIDS ONLY and I repeated cause there is many nasty adults reading this so DON EVEN TRY us kids think differently and we KNOW who we dealing with so don even try us.... oops forgot this a revise on an app sorry /;) winky smokey cool face LOL!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I really liked this movie. It took a bit to get going but then I was laughing so hard and the little girls were so cute.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. The romance had me sitting at the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down!
B004RSCWZ2|4.0|This is NOT a rockin' blues album. It is a soft, low-key, mellow blues album. Susan Tedeschi is her usual beautiful self. Her voice is one that I can listen to all day and all night. Simply one of the best female voices out there right now. And this is her perfect element with Derek working a subtle slide and dobro sound in back of her, slow grinding blues. Derek does not shine. Instead, he shows no ego here and lets his wife glow. Beautiful effort, but with the exception of \\"Learn How to Love\\" (a little more upbeat, with a melodic tempo sorta like Zep's \\"When the Levee Breaks\\"), this is not one to rock out with. Just listen to the soothing sound of Susan Tedeschi. Derek's a lucky man.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I watched an episode of Dexter on my Kindle Fire.  The clarity was amazing.  Just like watching it on a good TV screen.  As a matter of fact, the resolution and the sound were so good, I watched an additional episode the same day.
0385535147|4.0|The story is suspensfull, full of interesting facts on the penal system.<br />Just when you think you know the plot, it turns another direction.<br />Grisham is true to his writing style of his previous books.<br />I would love to see this book made into a movie.
B009CG2YDE|5.0|great game to pass the time! totally fun! the game is very easy too control. I wish I could give it 6 stars!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has so many twists and turns it should be a street in San Francisco. You're kept on the edge of your seat wondering from one page to the next - did he? did he not? Who's lying? Where does the truth really lay? Just as you come to a conclusion, your concept is blown out of the water. And the end is deliciously twisted and so forbidding for the future. If there is a future.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|What a terrible story.  It is!  But told in an easy and moving way by Jaycee that made it a riveting and very important story.  It brought awareness through her story,of sexual abuse, substance abuse, lack of neighbor and community insight, as well as the serious errors of probation departments and police.<br />Jaycee's writing and story brought me to reality, sympathizing with her past and hopeful for her and her daughters future<br /><br />I recommend you read this book.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Blu ray was a great purchase! Loved how the movie looked on my 46&#34; TV with the surround sound. Words are not enough. lol
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Can't stop listening to this album.  Lord knows I waited 11 years for it, but I am so happy for some new Aerosmith music.  Flashes of the early days, flashes of the Stones - some raunchy rockers, haunting ballads, many many brilliant moments.  Steven's lyrics are so much fun.  Something for everyone who loves the greatest band that ever rocked the world!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|For any fan of the Batman franchise, this is a must buy. The acting, the plot the everything, make this the BEST installment in the series.
B0071WQ7WU|4.0|I have fallen in love with this band. This album is very good - I prefer the harder rock songs and this album has some great moments.  Too many ballads for me to give it 5 stars, but that's just an opinion.  The lyrics are really meaningful on many of the songs.  Their ballads do sound great live, however!  Rock songs sound even better live!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved this book. It's like The Help meets Gone With The Wind. Fascinating story, felt very connected to the characters and I couldn't stop reading because I had to find out how it was all going to end. That my friends, is my definition of a good book!
1582701709|4.0|I love the content, hate the format.  I love bright colors - think SARK books on steroids.  (The brown dull format is a downer for me, but I'm sensitive to brown. and I'm not a fan of it; however, I can appreciate that brown/tan/neutrals appeals to the masses.  The content is something you have to digest.  Sometimes people think this is repeated information - and it is.  Even Rhonda Byrnes references previous books that the Secret embodies, but you have to digest this and dissolve your negative programming.  The only way to do that is to repeatedly reprogram yourself.  That's the gist of this book, and others like it.  5 stars for content.  Took one star away because I can't read the book for long because the tan color makes it uninspiring to read.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|Not as good as 50 shades, although the end of the book was excellent a refreshing change! Good build up and wonder!
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This is something I need to reprogram myself with over and over again.  Let's face it - scorpios can be vengeful:-)  I have noticed a difference in my life by offering love instead of hatred and ill will.  Many mini-miracles have happened.  I'm not yet quite to the point of having love being instinctual; I have to consciously make the decision, but I thank God for this tool that is getting me closer and closer to offering love as natural instead of ill will.<br /><br />I enjoy all versions, the Kindle version, the hardback, and the CDs.
0547884591|5.0|Every book Tim Ferriss writes changes your life. This book is no different. Actually, out of all his books, this one is probably the most life changing...<br /><br />Before buying this book my cooking skills were nil. Zero. Make stuff hot and eat it. If I want good food, go out to a restaurant. Cooking seemed boring and kind of hard, better left to the experts.<br /><br />The book teaches you very slowly and simply the basics of cooking. How to use a knife, how to cut stuff using dim mak, how to poach things, how to braise things, how to make a salad that isn't crap, etc. The book also teaches you how to make some incredibly tasty slow carb meals that will impress your friends and are easy enough to make on a routine basis. I eat the \\"4 Hour French Omelets\\" almost every morning, and Chinese chicken at least once a week. Before reading this book, I didn't even know how to make omelets that actually folded correctly.<br /><br />It's easy to read, the meals are easier to make than you think, and they are tasty as hell. I can't believe this, but after reading and following the book, my friends are actually complimenting my \\"chef skills.\\" I'm the guy who couldn't cook a proper omelet, and now I am cooking meals that amaze my friends for their taste and presentation. I laugh and think to myself \\"I read 4 Hour Chef, learned some basic concepts, applied them, and waah lah! It's that easy!\\"<br /><br />It's my favorite of Tim Ferris's books. It is perfect for anyone living a slow carb lifestyle, who wants to learn to cook meals that are tasty. Tim figured out that you only need to learn a minimal amount of stuff to become pretty competent in the kitchen. Once you learn it, cooking is a blast.<br /><br />If you don't believe me, I Instagram a lot of the meals here: [...] instagram.com/jrushie
0307887960|5.0|Great diet - easy to follow.  The different phases of the diet make it easy to follow, and if you slip, you can revert back to the Attack Phase
B005FISBTO|2.0|The makers of this dvd set give away the ending in the previews. The suspence is gone before the show starts. I am VERY dissapointed in the production of this! I have bought every season until now. I won't be buying the next one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fun! Fun! Fun!  If you ever wanted to know about kinky sex but were afraid to ask, this is the book for you.  Could not put them down.
0718158113|5.0|Delightfully charming in appearance, equally charming to read, you won't be surprised to find the meals you create from this cookbook make your taste buds melt until you find after a few mouthfuls you will only be able to pronounce it magnafic in French or at least, a French accent.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Great read for those that are interested in American History.  I got it for my Kindle Fire, and loved it.
1439152802|5.0|I loved this book!  Usually, books this long do not keep my attention, but this one did from the start to the very end.  The author does an excellent job of not letting the changes in narrators/time periods become confusing.  I became invested in all of the characters, and had to keep turning pages until I found out what happened to them all in the end.  Lyrical but realistic writing about England in the time of WWII. What an ending!!!  I can almost always guess the ending of a story by the middle, but I didn't at all with this story. I will remember these characters for a long time.<br /><br />***This was from an advance Netgalley copy
B00785P2QC|5.0|wow this game exceeds expectations and i like the trucks and dumpsters and factories... its allnaround cool.  the roads, houses, farms, and vehicles are cool.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Enjoyed this book tremendously!!  I learned a part of history that I was not familiar with. A very emotional story with a beautiful ending!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a great book. I loved that I could go from one book to the next. I cannot wait to read more books by this author
B007SGLZP8|5.0|An enjoyble fictional adventure from John Grishom.  Not his ususal legal battle but still some interesting legal twists. I found myself anxious to finish the book and wasn't quite sure if I was for or against the main character.  The ending made me realize what I had been hoping for all along.  LOVED IT!!
B004AQR24W|1.0|First off, this barely counts as a movie. Secondly, I 'm embarrassed I paid money to watch this. I would have been better off watching one of those inane talking animal films. Sylvester Stallone 's latest \\"movie\\" is a hackneyed action film with bad stock characters, a predicable plot, and bland dialogue. This is what happens when a bunch of has-been action movie stars try to get one last hurrah before they are forgotten.<br /><br />Again, I can't stress these facts any more: do not buy, do not watch, and for your own good don't bother with the sequel. I think I've made my point.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|LOVED Wool!<br /><br />And now learned that I love Hugh Howey.<br /><br />He's great.  Fun book, quick read, sort of sci-fi sort of tech fantasy.
B001EL6EHC|3.0|The dvds in the collection were excellent, but the remaining box space included tiny bells with place cards  which were useless.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I can't imagine the courage it took this author to write this book for us.  What a thing to endure!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I recommend reading this excellent  biography and then seeing the Spielberg film. They remind us that democracy is not chaos.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you interested to the very end.  The writing is superb.  Can't wait to start the final book in series
B00364K6YW|5.0|I actually owned the newer version before getting married and thought it would be awesome to be Mr. Darcy. I personally like this version way better than the new version. You get so much more information and backstory on all the characters. Great movie. I would recommend this to anyone.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I've had this in my shopping cart for several months now, and when it dropped to $33 on Black Friday, I knew it was time to pounce. I am super excited and have been waiting for this day since the first film came out on DVD.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Cute movie, not one of his better ones but still worth seeing. I think it's more of a young persons movie.
B002NHIJTW|3.0|That's about all there was that held my interest in this first episode.  I loved all of the music that they played, but I could see right away that it would get caught up in all of the teen angsty soap opera-ness that is the WB or CW as it has been renamed.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Have been a fan since I was a kid...and like many different periods of their career.  There are many GREAT things about all era's of KISS!  Although these tunes are far, far better than Sonic Boom on the whole, Paul's voice is clearly (and sadly) shot.  Where gene sounded, well...totally shot live on the last couple of tours...he sounds bad ass on this disc and HE is the one who shines.  One can't help but think that they are a total parody of themselves though at this point.  I love Eric and Tommy...but dudes...lose the make-up already, get into writing some tunes that are't silly \\"70's geared\\" lyrics or \\"Rah rah America shit\\".  There was a time and a place for that stuff...and I love it all...but it's always killed me that \\"Carnival Of Souls\\" never had the chance to shine...as I'd hoped they would roll down that road to stay \\"current\\".  Highlights here...every Gene tune on the disc!
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I can't help myself.  Every now and then when a pop single comes out bubble gum or not it's catching and addictively so.  With it's upbeat tempo and catchy lyrics it's hard to say no.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's a decent addition to the series. Not nearly as good. As the ugly truth, but if you are collecting them (like me) you have no excuse to not get this novel.
B002N7CTKM|5.0|I love all the nods to 80s fabulousness. I know that this will be one of my favorite shows, and I can't wait to see where they take this show.
1419702238|5.0|See my review of &#34;...Movie Diary&#34; as this will be the same. Once a child gets started, they almost always have to keep on going with the Wimpy Kid... so beware!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I kept hearing songs on the radio that I loved.  When I took the time to look it up I found out it was Florence + The Machine. Excellent stuff.
141970642X|5.0|While it's true I am not the reader of this book (or series...) the mother of the intended reader said as soon as her daughter got the books from her Grandpa (me...) that she went into her room and began reading! To say she's &#34;hooked&#34; would be an understatement. These books are really good and clean and seem to create a thinking process that keeps the kids looking for the next one to read. That is good.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|You can't go wrong with $.99 for an entire album, especially something as happy and fun as Bruno Mars. I love this album.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book, and was pretty much obsessed with it! I didn't want to stop reading it. Loved it!
030758836X|5.0|Best book I've read this year!  Unique concept and storyline.  The ending was amazing!  I highly recommend reading this book
0345802934|5.0|First things first. The title has nothing to do with IQ. The first character is the number 1 so the title is a play on George Orwell's 1984. Just in case you were wondering if I selected the title because of a possible correlation in title and my intellect!<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with Japanese author Murakami, his novels are critically acclaimed - he has been awarded the Franz Kafka Prize, the Jerusalem Prize and many others - and are a fantastical mix of surrealism and a rich (sometimes dense) detailing of everyday life. He consistently deals with themes of loneliness and alienation and soul, the self and reality (and especially perception/imagination and reality). 1Q84 tackles all that and adds acute questions of the-ends-justify-the-means murder, religion and cults, destiny, sexual abuse, revenge, and parallel realities. Oh, it takes a while to catch on, but first and foremost, it is a love story.<br /><br />Was it listening to Janacek's Sinfonietta that sent Aomame (\\"sweet pea\\") into another world with two moons? Did Tengo see the same two moons when he rewrote Fuka-eri's crude draft of Air Chrysalis? (And by the way, was that a story from the fevered imagination of a 17-year-old girl or was she describing things that actually happened?) Will either of them survive the revenge of a cult group called Sakigake and the brilliant and relentless pursuit of Ushikawa - a man with a large misshapen head that shouldn't be able to follow anyone without being noticed? And what of the \\"Little People\\" - who seem to hold special powers in 1Q84 and that seem to be looking for a bridge to 1984 - are they neutral or as malevolent as we suspect? And the big question: did Aomame and Tengo have to enter 1Q84 to find each other after 20 excruciating years of separation from each other and disconnect from the world around them? I don't think it's a spoiler alert to say that they became soul mates at age 10.<br /><br />Enough. You're with me or not. If I've scared you off completely, don't run away before reading the last sentence of this paragraph. If you've read other reviews I've written what you might have already discovered is I don't actually review books - I recommend books. Sometimes quite different books.  I know Murakami is not for everyone - though 1Q84 sold a million copies in Japan alone - and I'll have to admit, it's not my usual fare. But I recommend this book for its dense, other-worldly beauty - reading it creates that curious sensation of wanting (even needing and willing) it to be done and to never end.<br /><br />I read the lovely boxed set that was given to me as a gift by my son Merrick.ompletely, don't run away before reading the last sentence of this paragraph.

B004G600A4|5.0|My girls love this movie.  They have watched it at least 20 times since we received it a few weeks ago.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I'm such a Nelson DeMille fan that I was really taken aback by Panther's main character. His constant wisecracks ruined a really good story for me. About every third page I wanted to slap him and say, Shut up, John. Because of that, I won't read The Lion. Too bad.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I play these point and click adventure hidden object, puzzle games way way to much to be normal.....however I think it qualifies me to say, \\"BUY THIS APP! Stray Souls:Dollhouse Story is one of the coolest time sucks  out there!!!!\\"  Interestingly creepy storyline (with a skip option for those of you in a hurry ?)  the option to play casual or (I forget what they called the more difficult one but you catch my drift). Alawar usually puts out quality games and this is no exception. Worth it at twice the price! (No, I'm. not being paid to gush like this, ) the game is just THAT good. I played on a Kindle Fire. This is me and I approve this message. tee hee LOL. Thanks for reading this whole review,  you ROCK! You're my favorite you know. I feel as though we connected on a gaming level don't. you? Go on Grasshopper, it's up to you now.  ( I think I may need a 12 step program for rambling reviewers....Hello,  my name is &@%&@%@ and I'm a rambling reviewer! ) Okay you really have to stop reading now. Go outside get some air, have a glass of water. Make sure you minimize your screen when the boss walks by. It's. important to appear busy. I have to go man please....move on,  maybe give a different reviewer a chance. I mean it's possible they absolutely hated the game. Go on get out of here....get now...go on go on I don't. want you here....LEAVE DAM#IT! !!! Have a Happy... go on why not have two!?
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Maybe not on par with Toy Story or Cars, but still a fun saga for everyone from the wee little ones on up.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Definitely up to expectations.  I wish Vince health and recuperation since I jealously can't wait for his next submission.  Keep writing.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|good movie; I liked it better than when I first saw it since I'd just watched Casino Royale and the action in this movie picks up right after that movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and think the app is easy to use.  I can explore and save things I like from my iPhone and Kindle Fire.  Then I also have a quick way to show people what I am talking about if it comes up.  I have used it to share Christmas gift ideas, remind myself of what I am looking for in a store, share ideas for events like baby showers, etc.  It definitely comes in handy!!!
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|The graphics was very realistic.  Wonder what they use to create it.<br />The storyline is weak, in my opinion.  Nothing compelling to keep me interested.<br />Some part was ridiculous but I cannot tell because I do not want to ruin it for other people.<br />The most entertaining part is the tripplets.  Overall it's worth the $4.99 for the family and kids.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author keeps you guessing, which I liked.  I also enjoyed the character development.  I did struggle with the writing from time to time because it isn't written in a way that I felt sounded natural for people to talk.  However, that may just be a personal preference thing and other people may not agree.  I gave it four stars though, because I did enjoy it, but I did not love it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This free app syncs with multiple devices.  It also works well with Evernote Food which helps you keep track of your favorite meals.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is really fun and very addicting! Hard to put this game down. Many fun mini games to help pass time.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod Stewart's voice brings a new life to Christmas music. His mixture of standards and not-so-standard Christmas songs is unbelievably exciting and soothing at the same time. The duets are incomparable (the combination of Rod's raspy voice and Ella Fitzgerald's and Michael Buble's creamy voices are divinely inspired) and Rod's love of great R&B Motown style is showcased perfectly. Merry Christmas Baby joins the list with Johnny Mathis and Bing Crosby as a new Christmas classic.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|After you play this game for like 5 min. you'll need to start spending some money to go any further, lame!
