B000000OE7|5.0|Well, Ive been a queen fan for few years now, and Queen just isnt as good without the direction and guidance of Freddie, who wasnt alive for much of the musical arrangement on this album. Ive also heard the original versions of the Freddie mercury solos that were featured in the posthumous 'The Freddie mercury Album' which can be found on Mr Bad Guy. I actually prefer the originals, and some of the re-mixes are terrible compared to the originals, it seems they tried to mould the songs with the music of the time, trashy early 90's dance beats. Compare 'Foolin around', 'Living on my own',and in particular 'Your kind of lover' which they ruined, and wasnt actually that bad in 'Mr Bad Guy'. <br /> <br />In this album I cant argue they have done very well under the circumstances. The album musically, lacks some of the magic that can be found in all the previous Queen albums. There is definitly a missing Mercury perfectionism. What brings the album up to standard is the song writing. The lyrics are  beautiful in songs like 'Too  much love will kill you' and 'mother love', and 'winters tale' are very moving. 'Winters Tale', with Freddies vocals soaring, you can tell he was putting all his effort into it. His voice seems slightly 'tightened' possibly by illness. Very moving. Its such a shame that the rest of the band overlayed their vocals mid way through the song which just didnt work. Not the usual quality of the Queen Choir. <br /> <br />Musical Quality - 3/5 <br />Song Writing - 5/5 <br />Overall - 4/5 <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JLWN|5.0|When I first heard the name of the movie, I thought \\"Equilibrium...oooooook.\\"  At first, I wasn't really interested, because of the name...but then I got to see it when one of my friends had me over to watch movies.  I remember being hooked from the first scene on.  I had never seen a martial art with the gun as the central weapon, like the gun kata, before, nor have I seen it since.  What drew me the most to it, however, was not the gun battles or betrayal...it was the immense emotional conflict in Jon Preston, the main character...here was a man who, however accidentally, stopped his dose, and then saw the world with open eyes for the first time...and saw that the world he was loyal to was not what it should be.  He experienced anger, passion, frustration, humor, sadness, suspicion, shock, disgust, happiness, and absolute conviction-being that he knew what the right thing to do was, and then went and did it.  I definitely think that this movie was shafted out of awards, and should actually be recognized as a standard for emotional conflict and action.

0393312836|1.0|All this book is is a book of slang, and if you can get past the slang it is just a sob story of some dumb teenager too stupid to figure things out for himself. Burgess does make a good point about how training people to be good is taking away their identity but that issue is resolved too quickly. <br />If you are looking for a truly thought provoking book with similar ideas read A Brave New World which is actually worth the time.
B00005N5S5|5.0|In the post-apocalyptic future, reigning tyrannical supercomputers teleport a cyborg assassin known as the \\"Terminator\\" (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back to 1984 to snuff Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son is destined to lead insurgents against 21st century mechanical hegemony. Meanwhile, the human-resistance movement dispatches a lone warrior (Michael Biehn) to safeguard Sarah. Can he stop the virtually indestructible killing machine?
B0000020C4|5.0|With a stellar cast backed up by more than 200 strong voices and a wonderful orchestra, this concert has so much power that you'll stay glued to your seat 'till the end. The quality of the performances is topnotch (as expected from the aptly described Dream Cast) and the atmosphere is as exciting as can be.  <br /> <br />[The most notable performance, as many reviewers have pointed out, is from Tony and Olivier winner Lea Salonga, whose outstanding interpretation (right combination of dejection and bitterness; the great emotive voice is, of course, already a given) has provided the character Eponine the attention it deserves. Unfortunately for Frances Ruffele (whose non-stellar presence matched by her whiney, squeaky voice that leaves much to be desired kept this charming character out of the spotlight), comparisons are inevitable and her fans will have to content themselves with EXCUSES that Eponine is not a beautiful character and therefore deserves an ugly voice.]  <br /> <br />If you want the complete score, definitely get the Complete Symphonic Recording (which also has a good cast). If you want attention-grabbing performances, however, this is the album to get!  <br />
B00008PC2O|5.0|A decade after Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) destroyed the original Terminator, a second unstoppable killing machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives from the post-apocalyptic year 2029. But this time his mission is to stop an even deadlier Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), made entirely of shape-shifting liquid metal and determined to kill young John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance. Sarah, John, and the Terminator counter by going after the scientist responsible for developing Skynet, the computer system fated to destroy humanity, leading to an explosive and spectacular clash with the fate of humanity in the balance. Whereas James Cameron's original THE TERMINATOR was a low-budget marvel of efficiency and speed, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is an action-packed blockbuster with some of the most amazing stunts ever filmed and ground-breaking, Academy Award-winning special effects. Star Schwarzenegger was paid in the form of a $15 million dollar jet to revisit his most famous role as the Terminator, this time made kinder and gentler against the silent, relentless T-1000. One of the most popular films of the 1990s, James Cameron's action masterpiece is both a thoughtful look at violence in human nature and an exciting, nonstop thrill ride.
B00003CXCT|2.0|After I read the reviews, I borrowed the set from a friend. I asked how he liked it and all he said was \\"See it for yourself and you decide\\". After seeing the revised editions, I have decided that I would much rather see the original trilogy digitalized without all the new edits and changes. I think the edits ruined the set for those true fans of the original Star Wars films. Sorry; I'll keep my original VHS copies safe and protected until the originals are digitalized with upgraded sound and without the unnecessary changes, and I certainly won't be buying any new DVD sets until they are done properly.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Any true fan of star wars would not be angry just because George Lucas added some extra stuff...THEY ARE HIS MOVIES, and he can do with them what he wants. If he doesnt want to release the uncut or edited versions of the movies, then so be it! Live with what you have! These are the cenamatic marvels they were and still are! Buy these so the younger generation can enjoy them also! Great for all ages!
B00004BZ0N|4.0|To me this is an awesome rock record by a great punk band. They were able to transition from fast pissed off punk to a more subtle atmospheric rock sound in less than two years. While i would get the self-titled alum first i would get give em enough rope second so you can see how they were  begining to trasition and ultimately write london calling which is a sort of concept album in itself. Best songs: \\" hateful\\", \\"rudy cant fail\\", \\"lost in the supermarket\\", and \\" guns of brixton\\"

B0002OXVDW|5.0|When the DVD format appeared several years ago &amp; the studios began rolling out their catalogs on DVD, &quot;That's Entertainment&quot; was scheduled to be released but was shelved for a future release date. Well, the wait is now over &amp; it was well worth the wait.In addition, &quot;That's Entertainment: Part 2&quot; &amp;  That's Entertainment: Part III&quot; were released as well. You can purchase these movies separately but for all of you who remember these gems &amp; are planning to buy them, you absolutely must get the box set which not only has the three movies, it has a bonus fourth disc &quot;That's Entertainment: Treasures From The Vault&quot; which is only available in this &quot;Trilogy&quot; set. The packaging is normal (cardboard box,plastic cases, single sheet insert) but the movies themselves are gorgeous! the colors are vibrant which shows off a lot of what went into making the films &amp; the sound has been given a Dolby Digital 5.1 upgraded. If you love the original MGM musicals, your DVD collection will be incomplete without these movies. If you love these movies, Your &quot;That's Entertainment&quot; collection will be incomplete unless you buy the &quot;Trilogy&quot; box. Thank You.
0783232039|3.0|This is billed as horror/comedy, and I object to that billing strenuously. I can't recall one scene where I felt any real terror, but I did laugh out loud several times. Apparently what makes this a horror film is that the central theme revolves around one really mean little doll, his conflicted bride, and the death of a bunch of people. So that's what horror has come to in the United States. It's kind of sad. <br /> <br />Still, this movie had its merits. Viewed strictly as a comedy, it actually works. The performances were strong, even if the writing was over the top. There are a number of inconsistencies in the film, the most glaring of which was the amulet that Chucky needed. As another reviewer noted, why does he need that amulet now, when he didn't need it before? Perhaps there is a reason and I missed it, but I don't think so. But more importantly, Charles Ray didn't die with that amulet on. It's cheap and insulting to your audience to go back and rewrite events of the first movie so that they fit this one. That's an unwritten (or maybe someone wrote it down, like Robert McKee) rule of story telling. <br /> <br />Impressive here is the inclusion of a gay character. When's the last time you saw a gay character in a horror film (even if the film really isn't a true horror film, it's classified as such, and viewed as such by many)? Easy answer: never. So, kudos for that. <br />
B00005JMXX|5.0|I just finished watching this movie. It was awesome! If you're looking for an action-packed movie with killer special effects, then you should definitely see this movie! I was on the edge of my seat through the whole thing. Totally awesome flick. <br /> <br />One flaw in the plot is that it blames humans on global warming, when actually this kind of climatic change will happen/is happening because of regular cyclical solar weather and earth magnetic pole changes (although we should be conscious of not exacerbating or speeding up the process through our own pollution). If we just look at what was happening geologically 10,000 years ago on this planet, then we can see that these types of Earth changes are just part of the deal here on this planet.  <br /> <br />The scary thing is that something like this can and probably will happen, although doubtfully within a couple of weeks like it did in this movie! Still, it gives a lot of food for thought for anyone who is fascinated by the coming Earth changes we are already seeing evidence of during our own times through stronger and more frequent hurricanes and earthquakes and greater volcanic activity. <br /> <br />Regardless of the science, though, this movie is highly entertaining and fast-paced; extremely enjoyable to watch. If you enjoyed movies like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and Core, then you will like this film. It's even better than all of those. And I just can't say enough about the special effects. They were amazing.
B0002I831S|3.0|I got up and left after starting disc one to write this. I am disappointed seeing Kirk in Ep. 8 as the 1st show of the box set. I do understand that this is the airing order but I thought this was an all encompassing set; pilots and all. I feel a bit short changed as I have been waiting for this, like most people, for a long time so I can get the whole back story.
B0000020C4|5.0|Some people would like to make it appear that there is this dichotomy regarding the Eponine portrayals made by Lea Salonga and Frances, but the thing is, there really isn't.  The way ALL three recorded actors (Kaho Shimada, Lea, and Frances) performed their roles showed that they all characterized Eponine in the musical (not Eponine in the book) EXACTLY the same way: someone suffering from unrequited love and life's other misfortunes.  The only differences were in their respective ABILITIES to show the character: Kaho Shimada in her CSR performance was able to capture Eponine's loneliness, but failed to show her frustration.  Her performance was also hampered by her lack of fluency in the language (though her determination and success at learning the language just for the recording was impressive).  Frances, in the lackluster London and Broadway versions, showed a lot of emotion, but succeeded only at releasing emotional whining.  Her squeaky voice, her inaudible speech, her inability to hold notes, and her general lack of good vocal technique add to her failure in giving dimension to the character and the character's ability to generate empathy and sympathy from the audience. \\"Who cares if Marius doesn't fall for Eponine?\\" is the audience's general reaction to Frances' whiny portrayal of Eponine.  Lea Salonga, on the other hand, takes the character to a whole new level.  Showing exactly the varying levels of frustration, anger, bitterness, and resignation a REAL human being who's gone through Eponine's experience would [as a great actor would], coupled with an impressive ability to articulate the words clearly and hit the notes perfectly [as a great singer would], Lea Salonga has shown the world how significant this role could be given the proper attack.  She's a hundred times better than either Kaho or Frances combined in doing this role. <br /> <br />For those using the excuse that the Frances' interpretation of Eponine is closer to the character in the book (andtherefore justifying that she should eat her words when singing and whine all over the place using her squeaky voice), you should think of a better one that actually flies.  This is so pathetic!
6304493681|5.0|If you hear the word \\"anime,\\" or Japanese animation, and instantly think of popular shows like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Dragonball Z or Inuyasha, then it's high time to re-think those perceptions. \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is japanese animation for adults, in terms of both content and thematic material.<br /><br />Based on the original Japanese manga by Masamune Shirow and directed by Mamoru Oshii, \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" represents some of the best Japanese animation has to offer. Along with \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and \\"Spirited Away,\\" this film is one which truly showcases the creativity and artisitic potential of animation as a medium. Despite being almost 10 years old, \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is a movie which still resonates with audiences of today.<br /><br />The movie centers around Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg police officer involved in some vary dangerous work. The story starts with a bang, almost literally, as the Major assaults a secret meeting by jumping off the top of a building and shooting through a window, then vanishing. Everything about this sequence -- the gorgeous animation, the high-octane action, the developing story -- sets the stage for what is to come.<br /><br />The animation of \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" raised the bar and set the standard for future animated films. The animators somehow combine the violence of the story with an unparalleled beauty in the animation that still stands out today. True works of art are timeless, and that's just what \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is: timeless.<br /><br />Of course, much of the animation is used for the many action sequences in the movie, which are quite unforgettable. From heavy-hitting gun battles to a one-on-one fight with an invisible enemy, the action in \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is breathtaking.<br /><br />The story is surprisingly complex and engaging for a relatively short film. Involving government conspiracies, a talented hacker known as the Puppet Master, and some really excellent science-fiction concepts, \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" expresses some pretty deep themes about what being human means, what constitutes a human soul (or \\"ghost\\"), and how we define ourselves as individuals. The ending is surprising and will keep you thinking.<br /><br />Simply put, \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is an animated film that sets a high bar for other animated films to achieve, on all fronts. From storytelling to animation to thematic material, it's just one of the best out there. Definitely not for kids, but well worth viewing for almost any adult. You'll hear its whispered messages in your ghost for some time afterwards.e Shell\\" expresses some pretty deep themes about what being human means, what constitutes a human soul (or \\"ghost\\"), and how we define ourselves as individuals.

B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is one of those movies that's one can't say enough about, but it's also so very easy to say too much. What I say about likely won't capture what makes it so utterly charming and inescapably honest.<br /><br />There's the standard stuff -- the performances, for example, are uniformly excellent. Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey deliver what may well be the finest performances in their careers for this film, and Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson, Elijah Wood, and Mark Ruffalo also show up with some wonderful acting. The visual effects are sharply original and incredibly well-executed, so that they add to the film's story rather than serving as a distraction from it. The script is top-notch, conveying a rare complexity and a clear message through a unique story that nevers fails to captivate.<br /><br />If I say that this is now one of my favorite films, will that mean anything to you? It is one of my new favorites -- frankly, it's one of the best new movies I've seen in a long time, and it's a movie I know I'll be thinking about for a long time to come, and which I'll see many times again. I already know this, because it's captured my spirit and my imagination in a way that only a few movies have. \\"Fearless\\" was (and is) one such film, \\"Leon\\" is another. These are among my favorite movies, and now \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is too.<br /><br />The concept of the film is deceptively simple, a straightforward \\"what-if\\" story: what if painful memories could be just plucked out of our head? How would that affect our lives? How would it affect our selves? To explore this concept, \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" looks at the lives of two lovers who were once happy, but had a painful breakup. The film takes us through the process of one of these characters, Joel, as his memories of Clementine are removed from his mind.<br /><br />The way this movie expresses memory is what makes it so magical. The fractured, interconnected, tenacious nature of our most treasured memories is examined closely here, with an honesty that is refreshingly rare. The complex way Joel's memories intermingle (like his childhood memory of Huckleberry Hound and his adult memory of Clementine's name) is expressed with such clarity, such honesty... here's the part where it would be easy to say too much and ruin it all. Suffice it to say that this is a film which understands how we cling to our memories, how our memories cling to the heart, and how the heart yearns for that which is lost.<br /><br />Have I said anything to convince you? I don't know... I'm still a bit swept up in the movie myself, and that's all I'm really trying to say here. The acting, the writing, the direction, the music -- all were excellent in \\"Eternal Sunshine.\\" But what I really want to get across is that here, here at last is a film which might just capture your imagination the way it has mine, which might just set your heart beating and your mind racing and your soul reaching out for an unnamable something, a something which we rarely see but can all understand. Love, memory, loneliness, pain, and hope. It's all here, in a form so pure that it almost overwhelms.<br /><br />If these things mean something to you, as they do to me... if they're important to you, then I'd say this is a movie you might just come to love.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|It is a very hard line to cross in today's cinema to make a film that part comedy and horror film. Normally, when this happens we end up with something like the Chucky series. It began serious, but after seeing the new preview, I know they have given up serious horror and invaded into the world of campy horror. I was afraid at first that this film was going to go into that direction, but then I remembered ... this film wasn't made in America, it was made in Britain where the humor is actually intellectually funny. As I was sitting and enjoying this film from beginning to end, I couldn't help but wonder why America has not been able to master this style of film yet. Why is our comedies still heavily based in the sex humor or bathroom jokes? While there were some in this film, I felt the majority of the humor was logic and intelligence based. \\"If you listen to the words, you will laugh at the jokes\\" style of comedy instead of waiting to see who will fall over what first.<br /><br />With its firm grasp on the comedy aspect, Shaun of the Dead delivers an exceptional grade for its creativity. It takes a lot of brain work to be able to think of a story about zombies where our main characters are oblivious to the fact that anything horrible is happening in the world until the second act. That was actually some of my favorite parts of this film. I was there, sitting in the theater, knowing that it was a zombie film (still, can I call it that?), and nearly missing the entire zombie clues going on in the background. My eyes were focused directly on our star and scene-stealer duo, Shaun and Ed. One of my favorite scenes of this film is when Shaun is going to work after the dead have risen and goes through the motions as if nothing strange is happening while there is chaos and destruction all around. How many of us have gone to work and not even noticed anything-different happening in our daily routine. Sometimes we get so caught up in the motion that we miss any different actions. I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />What also made this film work on every level was the cast. Director Edgar Wright has done a fantastic job of placing the right actors with the right characters. They were each believable in their own part, and I loved every scene with Bill Nighy. He was perfectly cased and you could just tell that he loved being in this film. That is another great aspect of this film. It was a fun film and you could tell that the cast was having fun with their roles and were comfortable in their environment. So many times we watch these style of films and we see miscasting and uncontrolled actors doing anything to ensure that they stay at the top of people's minds. This wasn't happening in this film. I wasn't familiar with many of the actors, so I couldn't play favorites. All I could do was sit back and enjoy everyone and everything.<br /><br />I would like to end with the comment that this is still a zombie film. It is a love story surrounding a zombie film where the director has chosen to emphasize the love story instead of blowing everything up. I know that sounds strange, but you will get used to it American viewers. I mention that it is still a zombie film because I do not want people going thinking that this is a spoof. While it does pay homage to several of the classic horror films, this film stands on its own two feet. It had blood, it has violence, and it has those infamous scenes of people's heads being blown apart. That is why we see zombie films.<br /><br />Overall, if you love zombie films and you are a fan of The Office or any Hugh Grant film, than Shaun of the Dead will appeal to you. I don't remember the last time I witnessed such a creative film.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****tions.

B000099T2L|3.0|\\"Crazy In Love,\\" \\"Naughty Girl,\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" are awesome. And....that's it. How in GOD's name \\"Me, Myself And I\\" became a hit I have no idea. Probably just because she was the one singing it. They just randomly picked the third least horrible song off of this album and somehow made it a radio hit. Don't expect to get a single ounce of enjoyment from this that you didn't already hear from her on the radio. Other than the radio hits, this is pure filler. Ridiculously ballad-heavy and in some places foolish and airheaded, songs such as \\"The Closer I Get To You,\\" \\"Speechless,\\" and \\"Signs\\" are just plain terrible. The beats are incredibly mediocre and childish, and the lyrics don't say much, either. I can understand why \\"Crazy In Love\\" would become a huge hit-very good song-but the rest of her 'hits' blew up as much as they did because of her looks and her butt. America just can't get enough of her looks and her butt, so hell, why not keep her on MTV? Just like J. Lo. Beyonce, stick to the dance songs. That's really all you're good for.
0805076476|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk is amazing. He writes in the way that one thinks. He gets his imagery and messages across in a hilarious and interesting way, every time. His imagination never ceases to amaze and amuse me. Read This Book.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|This movie is like a throwback to Universals 1950s creature features.  While I understand that it's meant to be an homage to those films, this just doesn't do it for me.  Granted the special effects are very good, but the plot is thin and the story kind of jumbled up.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are very good, but both are capable of so much more.  As horror flicks go, it's good, but don't expect to see anything knew or exciting in this film.
B00008OLYN|4.0|I actually purchased Damnation upon reading the good words by Anthony Lucasson of Ayreon on his recent Human Equation CD and enjoying Akerfeldt's contribution to that work; however, this Opeth CD hardly blew me away at first. I stuck with it, though, and as Lucasson also said, it grew on me to the point of near addiction. I think it was just a matter of getting oriented to the brooding melodies that signify this CD. It is now amongst a regular rotation of my listening lineup, along with Deliverance. I have to thank Lucasson for introducing Opeth to my hungry-for-good-music appetite.
B00005JMXX|4.0|The producers kind of hit you over the head with this movie's message:  global warming is bad, man!  Be that as it may, this movie is exciting from minute one and doesn't stop until the very end.  The science seems sound, the plot is great, and the actors are top-notch.  One of the best films in which Dennis Quaid starred in very long time.  The movie is, of course, effects-driven, but that doesn't take away from the film.  Just watching that huge tidal wave hit New York was damn spectacular! On a poltical note, it was kinda funny to se the vice-president character made to look and sounds so much like our current VP:  potty-mouth Cheney.  Overall, this film is summer movie escapism with a message tucked in underneath. Very enjoyable.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The fifth star that I give to this product is for the release on DVD of the Star Wars Trilogy (DVD at last! wahooo!!) but for the movies itself I'm giving four stars (but that is exactly my ranking on all releases I've seen; some pros and equally cons). Honestly, I think the people that will like this particular release will buy it and those purist that will hate it will not. All we know already Lucas' willing to change over and over this trilogy. So really it is of no surprise any change on this box set. <br /> <br />But no worry, I think Lucas is a master of merchandising so I'm sure he will release a ORIGINAL-TRILOGY box set, a FULL STAR WARS SAGA box set and maybe an indivual episodes release (I based this teory on last decade's products on VHS: \\"Original for the Last time remastered\\", Special Edition, Special Edition w/ Episode I -or II?- previews). Besides, somewere in the future Lucas will be one with the force and, perhaps, the Star Wars rights will be on hands of many guys who will pay too much money for make their own additional changes for our children, grandchildren and so. There will be Star Wars for a long time yet. <br /> <br />Of course no release will be perfect for everyone, I belive if some Original Trilogy with only remastered audio and video were avaliable, there will be, also, a few purist that could think of those remastered features as \\"a destruction to the efforts and fights of those who worked so hard on a first class audio/video quallity on 1977\\" or they could say something like it was a natural response of a specific idology on a specific time with specific technoogy and any change on it will represent a violation to its integrity or... well anything. <br /> <br /> My advice: Buy it if you feel it's just right with your own appretiation of the Star Wars Saga. If it is not, wait for a release that will... I'm quite positive it will happen.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|VAN HELSING is supposed to be a lighthearted, camp homage to the monster movie genre. And it would have been just that but for the overwhelming pace, relentless CGI visuals (some shockingly mediocre) and the barrage of special effects which render it virtually unwatchable. It's said that 980 different special effects crowd this two hour movie---Is that all? It's all proof that even a $150,000,000.00 budget doesn't make up for a lack of plot and a script that seems pasted together with bubble gum. By the time the credits rolled I had a severe migraine headache.<br /><br />Clearly a devotee of the \\"Kitchen Sink\\" school of filmmaking, director Steven Sommers is absolutely hamhanded as he crams in every contrivance he can find, from an out-of-control team of horses racing toward a cliff with our hero in tow to Frankenstein's monster being grotesquely, repetitively barbecued alive to sailing ships at sea to gatling guns and rapid firing crossbows to sexy vampire women having threesomes with Dracula to werewolves. The Mummy never makes an appearance but that's only because Sommers already did two \\"Mummy\\" movies and used him up.<br /><br />The scenes shift with dizzying speed, pyrotechnics and rotating cameras give the viewer a sense of vertigo, and so much visual information is compressed into every second that VAN HELSING soon degenerates pointlessly into a visit to a carny House of Mirrors. It batters your brain and can't be grasped.<br /><br />Sommers substitutes frenetic action for storyline and CGI for characterization, wasting an opportunity to tell a really engaging story, and add a great chapter to the monster movie canon.  Sommers has said that he sees his films as reimaginings of the classic tales. Such an outlook could inspire some really great filmmaking. Unfortunately, here it doesn't.<br /><br />In what I could comprehend as a plot, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) the original vampire slayer, travels to Transylvania to assist Princess Anna Valerious (a very sexy Kate Beckinsale faking a deplorable Transcarpathian accent) in ridding the world of Dracula. It seems that the indestructible Count is planning on populating the world with thousands of vampire progeny (courtesy of his three wonderfully underdressed wives, the best element in the picture). In order to animate his undead spawn electrically he has to use Frankenstein (the monster, not the Doctor) as a kind of (quasi) human circuit breaker. The unfortunate monster is quite human here, a kinder, gentler version of Mary Shelley's creature.<br /><br />Throughout the film we are tantalized by hints of a deeper, darker relationship between Van Helsing and Dracula. Van Helsing is wearing a ring with the Dracula family crest, so the possibilities are tantalizing. Is Van Helsing the Son of Dracula or Dracula's brother? Is he, with his apparently superhuman abilities, one of the Undead? No, when the secret comes out, its that Van Helsing, The Fearless Vampire Slayer was in a past life...a Fearless Vampire Slayer. These are the kind of missed opportunities that dominate this picture.<br /><br />Jackman is the best thing about VAN HELSING. Dressed in Clint Eastwood's \\"second\\" wardrobe from PALE RIDER, and behaving like Pierce Brosnan in TOMORROW NEVER DIES, Jackman carries off his role with panache, humor, and grace. The character of Van Helsing demanded a great deal from Jackman physically, and he doesn't stint himself in the stunt sequences. Jackman is absolutely watchable. He definitely put himself in the running for James Bond with VAN HELSING.<br /><br />Beckinsale is maximal eye candy in this film. Although there are no love scenes and no bare flesh, Beckinsale's modern take on Late Victorian fashion doesn't disappoint. Her acting is only passable here, but it doesn't seem to matter, so little is required of the character.<br /><br />Robert Roxburgh is a total waste as Dracula. With absolutely no screen presence at all, Roxburgh weakens the entire film with an insipid performance, a shifting accent, and what's worse, no respect for the monster archetype character he portrays. Hands down, he's the worst Dracula ever to be onscreen. Bela Lugosi must be turning in his grave.<br /><br />In truth, the cinematography and the \\"period\\" atmosphere hold up remarkably well considering the crystal methamphetamine-fueled quality of the picture as a whole. VAN HELSING is good moviemaking gone rabid. A responsible editor and fifteen minutes of celluloid on the cutting room floor probably would have done VAN HELSING no harm and much good.the monster archetype character he portrays.

B00006SFLV|4.0|I have always disliked teenagers. When I was a child, they frightened me. When I was an adolescent, and was forced to spend most of my time in their exclusive company, they depressed me--all the more so because I was one of them. As an adult, they annoy me. As such, I tend to detest every TV show or movie that deals with their \\"issues\\". But I must admit that this show, with its undeniably superb quality in every aspect, forced me to reconsider my lifelong stance. As much as I hate to admit it, a TV show actually adjusted my attitude towards an entire demographic class. I still prefer to avoid interacting with them, but when I do, I am much less judgmental and cynical towards teenagers than I used to be. But it must be said that the show's writers displayed an acute sensibility to every character in every age group--the parents, the little sister, the teachers, the grandparents. The writing--and the acting and directing--achieved the sublime task of bringing the conflict and ambiguity of each person's inner life into the audience's radar. It's almost as if the viewer is deified, transformed into some sort of angel or ghost that can read the hearts of people who try so hard to hide them, engendering a profound, almost supernatural, empathy. When I first casually tuned in, half way into something like the fifth episode in its original airing, I was stunned. At first I didn't know what it was--I landed in one of the scenes where the mom and dad are interacting by themselves. The music and camera work kept my thumb off the remote, but I became enthralled by their portrayals. When I realized it was \\"that new teen show\\", I was tempted to skip it, but I couldn't. I watched the rest of the season religiously. A beautiful example of what good television can aspire to. I was always impressed by Claire Danes--she perfectly braided the foolish self-centeredness of adolescence into the wistful, reflective wisdom at the character's core. So much of the show was on her shoulders, and she carried it like a true professional, making it look easy.nd she carried it like a true professional, making it look easy.
B000002ILG|2.0|To be frank, I still have a copy of this on CD...and I still listen to it sometimes. But I would be kidding myself if I said that I feel the same way about the music of White Lion at 27 as I did at 12 or 13.  <br /> <br />This is a decent album with some hits from my childhood, such as \\"Wait\\", \\"Tell Me\\", and \\"When The Children Cry\\", which I did find to be sonic brilliance as a girl of 13, but however after growing up and finding out about bands such as HammerFall, Powerman 5000 and Iced Earth, I can say that I now consider White Lion to be \\"kiddy rock\\" only suitable for listening to when no one is around to hear you doing so. <br /> <br />However I am not above admitting to having been a White Lion fan as a child (heck, we all liked 'em as kids, didn't we?) and will say that White Lion had two special things going for them, one being Vito Bratta's guitar playing, and while he is no Stefan Elmgren or Zakk Wylde, he could definitely hold his own in the 80's. The other being Mike Tramp. Not for his music, but because he was so great-looking, that if you were female in the 80's, you had to notice, and 14 years later as an adult, I now realize that the guy couldn't sing to save his life, but he looked so good trying that we all bought the albums. <br /> <br />But, I'm getting off the subject here, so here's my review: This is an album that is fairly palatable to listen to when you don't want anything too hard or too soft or anything that will make you think too much, as most of the songs here are listenable, but some such as \\"Lady of The Valley\\" and \\"Lonely Nights\\" aren't due to the fact that WL try too hard to tackle what they consider serious subject matter.  <br /> <br />I am giving an honest opinion here when I say if you can find it for $10 or less, pick it up. It IS worth that much. Otherwise don't bother. Save your money and buy some really good metal, such as anything by HammerFall, Iced Earth or Powerman 5000. <br /> <br />The reason I gave this title two starsis because, whereas I found it disgustingly brilliant at 13, by my standards today as 27 year old music journalism major this is nothing to stand up and cheer for. <br /> <br />Buy only if you liked this band as a child.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|The movie has a horribly weak plot and mediocre special effects. I am giving the extra star because I was interested enough to keep watching till the end. Don't make my mistake.
B0002IU988|4.0|This is a great album.  I liked Creed and I like the new Alter Bridge.  They are different, of course, that is what they were going for..no doubt! <br /> <br />I look forward to the next album!
B0000CFW87|1.0|Like much of the easy listening music out these days (Kenny G, Celine Dion, and Norah Jones) Josh Groban's music is nice sounding but it lacks musical nutrition. He is the musical equivalent of a Twinkie..sweet and fluffy, high in calories but low on protein. I normally wouldn't take the time to express my dismay on  matter this, but where I work,I have to listen to the local \\"soft rock favorites\\" station and if I hear \\"You Lift Me Up\\" one more time, I may do something foolish like kidnap some thirty something office woman, tie her up and make her listen to \\"Earache My Eye\\" by Cheech and Chong....Not really, I just need to vent..Especially when it kicks into that Gallic Irish vibe....how cliche! This music aims for the lowest common denominator with no specific sentiments other than the usual \\"I love you and I would be nothing but navel lint without you\\" nonsense. Don't get me wrong...I love a good love song as much as the other person..Hell, I am even a bit of a romantic. I love the music of Carol King, Bread, Barry White, The Carpenters as well as contemporary grooves like Kruder and Dorfmeister, Massive Attack,  Zero 7, Air and Crazy Penis (The UK's best kept secret) I think the the thing that bugs me the most about Josh and his ilk is that it's generic...generic music,generic lyrics...Yes the production is nice but its not inspired or innovative. It's bland,pedestrian and prosiac. Thers no groove, no\\"Umpf\\"..This music doesn't make me want to fall in love,,it makes me want to listen to punk music and incite anarchy...and I'm 40! God help us all if Josh ever does a duet with Celine Dion...I think we were warned about this in the book of Revelations! Be afraid, very afraid.
B000089RVX|5.0|Haunting and energetic songs full of passion, love, and loss.  Dark and meaningful lyrics that really make you think.  This is a hauntingly beautiful and solid album! <br /> <br />
B0002IQJUK|4.0|I have to say that I took away one star simply because of the fancied up pop/rock disc 1 part. I don't like the way they dressed up Gavin's obviously r&b soul voice with a bunch of pop/rock catch tunes and beats. I mainly listen to the Stripped disc 2, it is the most moving, emotional, and great display of Gavin DeGraw's vocal and musical talents. If you want to hear the real Gavin DeGraw listen to the Stripped version.  <br /> <br />The Stripped version is the version that should have been put out in the first place but we all know how much the mainstream loves pop/rock music. Now don't get me wrong, some of the dressed up pop/rock versions of a few of the songs like \\"I Don't Want to Be\\", Crush, and Just Friends sounds really good. But overall, it's not as good as the live acoustic versions of those same songs on the Stripped side.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this version of Chariot to people who don't mind listening to different versions of the same songs with one extra song thrown in on the Stripped version. It's a great cd! Buy it!!!
B00005JMAH|3.0|The Prisoner of Azkaban is indeed my favorite novel in the series thus far, and I was very excited about the movie. However, to my dismay, it was a poor representation of the book, in all of its glory. The scenes were choppy, many important aspects of the story were removed, like many of the quidditch matches, for example. The time and place in which Harry receives the Firebolt is a horrible misrepresentation of the sequence of events in the novel, and the movie fails to explain Harry's success in the quidditch tournament without the Firebolt. Furthermore, there are instances where this movie is not even true to the direction of the first and second movies! Unless, through some supernatural force, the landscape of Warthog's grounds can change its formation, then I see no resonable explanation for the appearance of the grounds. The Whomping Willow appeared atop a hilly cliff, whereas, in the Chamber of Secrets, it is upon a flat courtyard just outside the castle. Furthermore, the journey from the castle doors to Hagrid's cabin appears much steeper than it has before.    <br />On a final note, and with no offense to Michael Gambon, I do not feel that Gambon portrayed Dumbledore accurately and with the same calm fierceness that Richard Harris brought to the character. Gambon's Dumbledore appeared shifty, and somewhat insolent. The movie did not touch upon Dumbledore's most important interactions with Harry, the ones where it counted, and I was disappointed by this. Overall, I would have enjoyed the movie much more, if I had not read the novel first. But, since this is not the case, I cannot say that I am pleased with the movie's turnout.
B00006V9A0|1.0|I think our prayers have been answered. Yes, it seems the Nirvana boxset is slated for a Nov. 23rd release. It will contain a whopping eighty one (!) songs total, says NME. And that includes the raw mix version of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" before Albini got his baby oil-covered hands all over the song. Plus, it'll have the KAOS radio show AND some video/accompying audio from their March 1987 house party gig that Kurt, Krist, and Aron (yes, I said Aron) played. Yeah, us die-hard fans already have it on \\"Nausbaum Road,\\" but it'll be great for you guys to hear/see it too. PLUS it'll have one of their January '93 Rio studio sessions and parts of the previously-unsurfaced January 16th and 23rd 1993 Rio shows. I couldn't forget to mention those home demos either. ANYWAY, for the love of Pete, bypass this thoughtless compilation of songs we've heard too many times, and save every cent you earn to buy the admittedly overpriced boxset... and then burn it for me because I'm a poor sod. Beat that Ty.  <br /> <br />Cheers!
B000094HMU|4.0|Well, this is a very large turandot.  The sets are lavish and the stage action is evocative of chinese new year.  The costumes appear to be, almost incredibly, detailed!<br /><br />I own several Turandots, but I the vienna Marton, Carreras, Riccarelli is the most fruitful comparison.<br /><br />Musically, Levine conducts a more restrained Turandot than Maazel.  He holds the orchestra back a bit more, more than likely due to the size of the Met.  But I have no complaints on this reading, it is a 5 star reading.<br /><br />  Turandot is the Dramatic Soprano Eva Marton.  When choosing between this and the other option, consider that here her voice is more forced and squealing.  Her top is extrodinary to behold, a real force of nature.  Soimetimes the squelch is exciting, but it is not healthy.  He costume is much more impressive in this Met production, and she is dowright scary.<br /><br />  Domingo plays Calaf.  He is, to me, surprizingly overwhelmed bythe orchestra.  This true from the end of act 1 until act 3.  When the orchestra turned up the heat, domingo was drowned out.  Now, Placido sand this role with the legendary Birgit Nillson in 1968, and he was heard just fine.  The difference here is the constant forcing.  He appears to be under great strain, (noting the 2nd act Crack at \\"No, Gli Enigmi sono tre!\\"<br /><br />His acting is intense and heroic, with much posturing and heroic arm gesturing.  It is clear that Domingo was a bit overtaxed by the tessitura of Calaf.  He does, however, excel whenever the Orchestra allows it.  The Vienna production features Jose Carreras, who, unfortunatley, has many of the same problems.  Although, If I were forced to choose Calaf, I would choose Carreras as Calaf.<br /><br />  As Liu Leona Mitchel really shines.  Signore Ascolta is well sung, and she is a wonderful actress.  Paul Plishka, who these days can be seen as the Judge in Sweeney Todd, is a perfect Timur.<br /><br />  Overall, this is the most Lavish production of Turandot, with the best costumes, the best Staging and the most overwhelming scale.  The Vienna production, available on video, is perhaps a touch more polished.th the best costumes, the best Staging and the most overwhelming scale.

B00000JCOV|5.0|again. im seeing people who hate slipknot. those of you who do are stupid. this cd is great. some of these songs arent too good, I know. But lots of the songs are really addicting. and if your one of those ppl who only like this cd just because of Wait and Bleed, then you suck. cuz that song is overplayed and isnt really even that good. the songs worth hearing on this cd is (Sic), Surfacing, Eyeless, Diluted, Spit It Out, Only One, and Me Inside. But i would definitely recommend you try out Vol. 3 first because its much better than this cd anyways.
B000002BPS|4.0|Coming off of the multi-platinum success of 1994's \\"Smash\\" with the combination of switching labels, from punk rock label Epitaph to Columbia, it comes as no surprise that \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" received a lot of heat from critics and fans alike. It actually seems a little confusing when you listen to the album. The Offspring kicked it up another notch, spinning out a harder, edgier metal album with less of the poppy hooks than it's predecessor. In addition, there were several fans (you may remember) claiming that they \\"sold out\\" to a corporate label. After listening to the record, it's obvious that that is completely untrue. The combination of punk and metal easily stamps this CD as the heaviest record they've ever made. Although it may be a bit inconsistent and sloppy at times, the record is still incredibly fun to listen to.<br /><br />There are some head banging tunes that scream for you to turn up the volume. I'm sure everyone remembers \\"Gone Away\\", which still receives airplay to this day. Other standouts include \\"Mota\\" (marijuana, if you didn't catch that before), \\"Me & My Old Lady,\\" \\"Meaning of Life,\\" \\"Intermission\\" where it sound like Dexter is dropping the kids off at the pool and \\"Change the World\\".<br /><br />All in all, \\"Ixnay on the Hombre\\" is sadly the most forgotten album in their discography, being dwarfed by \\"Smash\\". It may not be their best album, but it's definitely not their worst. Even when their off, they still manage to create a seriously rocking piece of punk revival that is a lot of fun to listen to.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|wow. i cant believe most of you. saying slipknot has no talent and their music changed to much to be liked. This cd was amazing. Their other cds are great too. there are great songs on this cd like Blister Exists, Pulse of the Maggots, The Nameless, Three Nil, Welcome, and pretty much all of them are great. and theres nothing wrong with having at least one or two mellow songs. I would definitely recommend this for metal fans and slipknot fans. dont listen to those retards who say slipknot is a poseur or anything. Theres no way you couldnt like slipknot, for all we know they secretly listen to it. slipknot is most likely the most unique band out there. if you like slipknot I would recommend you try bands like Slayer, KoRn, System of A Down, Metallica, Murderdolls, Disturbed.
0140431179|3.0|I have never been able to develop an affinity with Stevenson's writing. The reasons for this are indefinable, but the fact remains - I do not care overly much for any of his work. \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" is the only one of his works from which I have gained any satisfaction. Its brilliant characterization, its seductive atmosphere - both serve to give the story depth and immediacy. For all that I couldn't rate it higher than three stars. I suspect that at least part of the reason is that \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" has become so deeply rooted in pop culture that most people know exactly what the relationship between the two men is, thus removing the element of tension from the story. For me, the biggest problem I had was the anti-climatical ending. While the final two chapters shed a great deal of light on Jekyll's actions, I felt as though Stevenson was beating me over the head with his themes. I would have prefered something more subtle. As for the other two stories in this particular edition ('A South Sea Bridal' and 'The Ebb-Tide'), towards them I feel quite indifferent.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I am a fan of Mr Moore not so much for the content but for what happens after people watch his films. In a time when everyone is afraid to discuss issues and question authority his films are desperately needed.  <br /> <br />Even the most hardcore republican who follows all Bush dictates without question needs to watch this film (I'm a former fiscal conservative republican). If you support these wars you need to see what it is really like out there in Iraq for the soldiers. You also need to see the grief a mother goes through when her son is lost. These are not propaganda pieces but are real people and footage. If you still think preemptive war against a non-threat like Saddam was worth it then you cannot deny the price to be paid now and for some time in the future (can you say higher taxes and draft?).  <br /> <br />Watch the film. Ignore the part that makes Bush look like a fool if you can't take it (first half). Form your own opinion. Talk to a stranger about it.
B0000640VN|1.0|Let me say first that I don't hate all romantic comedies.  This review is not a genre hit piece, but an indictment of the themes of this particular film. <br /> <br />The titulary Kate is one of the most regressive film heroines I have seen in recent years.  Her exhaustion with her career and with modern life is a perfect example of what the current crop of feminist backlash thinkers would have you believe about the condition of American women today.  Too bad for them, it's complete bunk.  The idea that a successful, smart woman like Kate would jump back in time to an era where a woman's worth was completely dependent on her husband, and where enfranchisement was decades off, just to have someone make her toast with mascarpone for breakfast is offensive.  And the idea of the modern American man as either a predator or a buffoon (or both, which J.J. is shown to be) is equally offensive. <br /> <br />I could provide you a scene by scene academic analysis of how the film constructs these ideas, but an essay of that length is not possible in this forum.  Instead I will say this: if you decide to see this film, just keep these implications in mind.  No film is \\"simply\\" a light, romantic comedy as some would have you believe Kate & Leopold is.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|First off, Ellen Burstyn is the STAR of this movie, shining like a nova in a no-holds barred, courageous, unique performance. She was nominated for the Oscar, and booooohhh! to the Academy for passing her by. Perhaps they could not handle such pure brilliance? <br /> <br />The story is not so unusual, and surely there are even more brutally honest films dealing with drug addiction, than this one. What is unusual, however, is  the editing, especially towards the end, when we, the hapless viewer, frustrated because we can not reach out and put an end to their suffering, watch all four protagonists get tossed from one end of Hell to the other, in short, brutal sequences, so fast and furious that we can not even keep track of what is happening.... and perhaps because it's better so because the pain and agony we are presented with is simply too realistic and impossible to bear. <br /> <br />Yes this is a cautionary tale. What makes it stand out from among  the others is that it encompasses four different people. Director  Darren Aronofsky is outstanding. By including the mother, Ellen Burstyn, and her fast rollercoaster into Hell because of a jaded doctor who carelessly prescribes high doses of diet pills, he has enriched the plot. Though middle aged, Sarah Goldfarb has lived a secluded life and thus is an innocent, with an old-fashioned trust in the omnipotence of her doctor. <br />Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) lives in Coney Island, and is the mother of Harry (played by Jared Leto). Sarah gets selected as a guest on her favvy TV show, which jolts her out of her apathy as a lonely widow, wishes to lose weight to look good on screen, and finds the aforementioned doctor.  Meanwhile, her son Harry, his girl friend Marian(Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans) step into an accelerated ride into chaos. <br /> <br />There are enough plot twists to keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, plenty callous scenes to infuriate you. Harry ends up in the hospital with a clearly life-threatening inner-arm infection from heroin usage, and the doctor, instead of treating him PRONTO, calls the police and has him tossed in jail. I am not sure if such a thing can be done in the real world, or perhaps this is just naive outrage on my part? <br /> <br />Another amazon.com reviewer, \\"Pen Name: Mr. X (NYC)\\" offered a good observation on August 9, 2004: \\"... this movie doesn't make the character's bad decisions equal bad outcomes, the director forces these bad outcomes onto the characters with unrealistic events. Diet pills don't produce what you will see in this movie, and they arent going to use electro shock therapy. \\" <br /> <br />Mr. X. is correct, not everyone will freak out on diet pills as Sarah Goldfarb does here, and not every drug addict takes it to the bitter end to end up in jail or in a sex-party for freakish, well-dressed, pillar of the community type of men. Yes indeed some drug addicts might encounter angels who will lift them out of Hell. But do you want to chance it? <br /> <br />I used to be a die-hard can-do, will-do, person. I did not believe that there is such a thing as an \\"addictive personality.\\" But my opinion has been changing lately. Yes, it is quite possible that not only is there an \\"addictive personality,\\" but \\"addictive chemistry,\\" meaning you are born with or later fall prey to chemical imbalances that leave you vulnerable to be hooked on all kind of things, from drugs to alcohol and cigarettes.  So, it's best not to play Russian roulette, don't unchain the sleeping beast, and most importantly, don't ever be too sure of yourself! <br /> <br />Parents, do indeed serve this film to your teenager, along with his/her Wheaties and multi-vitamin pill, for breakfast.
B000089CJI|5.0|This CD is amazing and has inspired me in so many ways. I've never identified with music so well before or ever felt such a sense of overwhelming peace while listening to music before. No matter how bad of a day I'm having, Postal Service's music totally transmits to a higher place where I know everything will be better. While I love Death Cab for Cutie I must say that I love Postal Service much more and will be greatly disappointed if they don't release more music. I couldn't say anything negative about them if I tried...they're simply amazing.
B000001FOL|5.0|I've listened to this album literally hundreds of times, for reasons I can't entirely explain. It sounds like a joke - a heroin-addicted German model singing artlessly in English, with violins and flutes? Come on! But this cuts me to the bone, every time.    I'm not sure this is a CD to be recommended; I'm truly afraid to buy it, myself. Would I listen to anything else if I did?    Paralyzingly, ridiculously beautiful. Thank you, Phil.
068987474X|4.0|Honestly, I liked this book and found it amusing.  It's well written with great humor.  It was able to give me some insight into some of my previous dating experiences.  However, I don't think it's the be all and end all of relationship advice.  While I do think there is some truth in what Greg Behrendt says, I definitely think there are some exceptions to every rule.    I would recommend this book to other women and I probably will adopt some of the dating approaches.  In a nutshell, the message of the book is quit is to quit accepting bad treating from men, and making excuses for them.  Who can argue with that?  Instead of sticking with a loser and justifying his bad behavior, MOVE ON!  There are bigger fish to fry.    It may sound harsh and depressing but honestly, it's liberating.  When I think about how much time and energy I could have saved it boggles my mind.  I stuck around for so many jerks and put up with such bad treatment.  Knowing how much time and energy I'll save in the future is a beacon of hope.    While the book is enjoyable and funny with good advice, I'd take everything in the book with a grain of salt.  There are no absolute's.
B00009AOBI|4.0|This is an incredible movie, about a deformed child whose mother runs with a biker gang and as a result, he was raised around people of this ilk. But instead of having a low sense of self, he is surrounded by people who love him. The day he enters into a new school, his mother and the gang accompany him. At first he is afraid, but the support he has from his mother (played by Cher)is more than enough to get him through. He is a bright kid who has street sense and a kind heart.  <br /> <br />You know what is going to happen and the morning Cher comes into his room to wake him for school, only the most coldhearted can hold back the tears. This movie is about the love of life and how powerful support from peers and family can be. But this kid's handicap can nowhere compare with that of black kids who are castigated and locked out simply becuase of skin color. As a teacher myself, I recommend this movie to middle school kids as part of their \\"ethnic studies\\" requirement. They might not be able to deal with the race issue, but \\"Mask\\" will teach them the value of character, and that the old saying is correct; \\"The strength of criticism lies only in the weakness of the person being criticized.\\" Think about it -- and get this movie; don't rent it, BUY it!
B0002KVUKW|1.0|My favorite all-time movies, the ones I've watched repeatedly for more than half a century, are Universal's monster prototypes: the Mummy, the Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein. It was with supreme excitement that I finally got to watch the much hyped \\"Van Helsing.\\" I left with a throbbing headache and with so much disgust I wanted to gather a mob of villagers to storm the movie honchos that green-lighted this $150 million project. First, it looked like the movie was filmed through a pitch black filter. In many scenes, it was impossible to make out the figures and especially the monsters. Secondly, there was so much going on that I gave up trying to figure out the plot. Thirdly, the monsters were disasters. Dracula should have been a sinister, unearthly creature but to me it looked like amateur night in Dixie. The werewolf was obviously such aCGI created creature that you felt no fear. The magic of the old movies is that they introduced audiences to one monster and a small group of people. You got to know them. Even when Universal combined several of the monsters into one of its great horror-fests, like \\"House of Dracula,\\" \\"Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman,\\" you became intimately involved with the key figures, the victims and the monsters. In \\"Van Helsing,\\" it was like a visual circus gone mad. One positive result from this movie: Universal has recently released all its famous monster legacies in beautifully created packages and at amazingly low prices. Let's say our prayers that there is no sequel to \\"van Helsing.\\"
0440180295|3.0|This book is defenitly one of the 20th century's finer works of liteture but one would have to have a taste for unusal writing and ideas. A balanced mix of science fiction and historical events and unheroic characters to create a novel that has lasted it's time and times to come. The ideas that are presnted throughout this novel are not easy and but beautiful if one can be opened minded to them. <br />     I suggest to try to read this and finish even though the writing style is unnatural.
B00005JMAH|3.0|As a Harry Potter fan and a fan of Prisoner of Azkaban in particular, I looked forward to the release of this film. However, I was disappointed in the lack of story behind the pretty shots and artistic moments. <br /> <br />I can understand, due to time constraints that some things needed to be cut. I'd forgive leaving out the Quidditch Cup if there was other things going on. There were not. How is is possible to make a film of Prisoner of Azkaban and not explain about James Potters' friends as animagi? If you didn't read the book, you'd have no idea what was going on in the movie.  <br /> <br />Also, while the film was dark, I didn't get that the sense of fear regarding Sirius Black was a big enough issue. If that aspect was palyed up, then the film would have been that much more intense. <br /> <br />If you want to understand the story of Prisoner of Azkaban, read the book. If you want to be left confused by a film with chunks of story left out of it, by all means...see the film.
0307203204|5.0|I have a 3-month old baby girl, and since her birth, I've been looking for short, colorful books to read to her that would be interesting to her. I've bought some books that were recommended to me, but they just didn't seem to fit her age. I came across this book at Barnes and Noble the other day, along with some other books I'd been looking for such as \\"Goodnight Moon,\\" but since I was only buying one book that day, it had to be \\"I Can Fly.\\" It grabbed me from the beginning - the cover's adorable illustration accurately depicts what the contents of the book's illustrations will be, and there are just few enough words on each page for a baby to enjoy, ie \\"A bird can fly, so can I.\\"  This is a Little Golden Book, but the pages are hard and not bendable for younger children so they won't tear them or eat them. It's exactly what I was looking for. I am so pleased to have found it!
B00028HBKM|5.0|This film truly amazed me.  I have heard arguments debating if this is Protestant or Catholic--- either way, It is SO relavent to human life!  (Get beyond your rhetoric people!)  The point is the portrayal of LOVE!  This movie movie moved me far beyond tears, this movie changed my life.
068987474X|1.0|I've never seen \\"Sex and the City\\", and now I'll make sure I never do. This book just rehashes \\"The Rules\\" ad nauseum. If you accept simplistic stereotypes of the sexes, then enjoy. But if you have evolved enough as a human being to understand that people/relationships are complex, skip this book. OK, I confess; I didn't read it entirely, either; just a portion. That's as much time as I was willing to waste, and I'm CERTAINLY glad I didn't invest any money on it.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|because of another reviewer who noted that he was playing a record, not a cd.  So I bought the LP and wow, that terrible car radio sound was gone.  The cd is the 'compress the dynamics to make everything loud' careless engineering of the computer age.  Now I could really hear the fine playing of not only Clapton, but Billy Preston and Jim Keltner.  As for the critics of his being a rich white boy, Clapton does not attempt to impersonate Mr. Johnson.  That would truly be disrespectful folly.  Instead he does a genuine and involving interpretation of the inspiration of his youth.  Still, you might be moved to check out the original.
B00000K3G8|4.0|The original LP version of this was a mere 9 songs, and was absolutely brilliant. I remember playing it constantly, wearing it out much like my two album \\"The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads\\" double live album. I also got to see the concert film at some midnight show and was enthralled...a concert movie for people who liked music! I loved it so much that I eventually got David Byrne to sign the book that came with the album.<br /><br />So I was really hyped to hear that the entire concert soundtrack was about to be reissued on CD. Seven extra songs! Warm with nostalgia, I finally bought the disc. Boy, was I let down. First, it isn't the whole concert. \\"I Zimbra\\" is particularly missed. Then, of all the crappy songs to include over that one, we have the Tom Tom Club and their SERIOUSLY dated \\"Genius Of Love.\\"<br /><br />One of the brilliant things about Talking Heads is that they may have been trend setters, but they were never trend mongers. The music sounds just as fresh today as it did when I slit the shrink wrap on the 1984 Album. But the Tom Tom Club was a lightweight side project that scored one novelty hit, and it sticks out like crayon smears on a DaVinci. I reach for the skip button just about everytime its lame, cliched, and oh so 80's stage patter starts to invade what used to be a flawless CD.<br /><br />It takes what used to be a 5 star CD and knocks it down by one. It also provides continual proof that that not all unreleased tracks are really a \\"bonus.\\" Since it has finally come out on a double disc, I strongly recommend the remastered and reissued \\"The Name Of This Band is Talking Heads\\" over this. At least the expanded tracks aren't an emarrassment.
068987474X|1.0|An excerpt from the book: <br /> <br />\\"I hate to tell you, but that whole \\"I don't want to ruin the friendship\\" excuse is a racket. It works so well because it seems so wise. Sex could mess up a friendship. Unfortunately, in the entire history of mankind, that excuse has never ever been used by someone who actually means it.\\" <br /> <br />Funny.....I've had a female friend or two that I was attracted to but genuinely didn't want to ruin my friendship with.  I've known others who have been in the same situation. <br /> <br />There are a plethora of such quotes from the book I could say the exact same thing of. <br /> <br />What can I say?  This book is filled with nothing but huge generalizations about men that simply are not true.  And what purpose will it serve?  To ruin potential relationships or romantic interests with men they could have otherwise pursued?  Oh wait, no....man pursue, woman submissive and wait; man hunt, woman nest and cook. <br /> <br />This book is absolutely ridiculous, and I shudder at the thought of women actually using this as a source of advice on dealing with men.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|Just like a man, even if he is a marionette.  If you've seen the movie, you know exactly which scene follows it.  By the way, that scene does not go on too long, it's friggin' hilarious, and you know it.    Yeah, people are right when they say that if you like \\"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\\" you'll enjoy this one.  The most perverted and profane satire since SPBLU made its way into theaters over five years ago, easy.  It's just fortunate that Trey and Matt's projects are so appropriate for the times.  Of course, that is exactly what also dates their material, but that's a small quibble.    The visuals are meaty and expensive, the songs are laugh-out-loud funny (\\"But what would yew dew...\\" \\"Team America, f--- yeah!\\" \\"I'm so ronery\\") and above all the puppetry is craftsmanlike.  Those who can't get into the gross-out humor (endless vomiting scene) will appreciate the technical aspects of it, if for nothing else (the puppet sex scene, hehe).  Listen, that scene was hard to pull off, you  know.  But Trey nails the look of it with those quick dissolves.  It had me in stitches.    Bottom line: this should've been released during the summer, alongside \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\".  Because they both have Michael Moore in them.  Hehe.  If this type of gross, violent, profane puppet film tickles your fancy, then definitely check out Peter Jackson's stellar achievement \\"Meet The Feebles\\".    4.5 stars.  This film deserves your money -- matinee or evening.
0792833236|5.0|_Raging Bull_.  Just say its name and the film has a power and presence that few films have.  Before I watched the film for the first time, I had alternately heard it described as \\"the greatest film ever made with the most powerful performance of Robert Deniro's career\\" and \\"some boxing movie.\\"  After having seen it, I can definitely say that _Raging Bull_ is anything but \\"some boxing movie.\\"  But, of course, we all knew this.  Just say its name.<br /><br />Shot in black and white, combined with a plot that has become all too characteristic of other \\"boxing\\" movies and men of rage, _Raging Bull_ derives all of its energy from the explosive performance of Robert Deniro captured against the backdrop of a host of characters that fuel, support, and withstand his rage.  While they are sometimes prone to falling by the wayside, both Joe Pesci's and Cathy Moriarti's performance deserves a close look.  Without them, Robert Deniro would have no home to wreck, no relationships to crush, and the film would not have created the same level of sympathy.<br /><br />Yet it seems wrong to speak of sympathy.  What are we watching?  Certainly not tragedy-Scorsese does not sympathize with our raging bull, except when he's in the ring and seems untouchable and beyond the realm of pain and punishment.  The film reaches beyond the limitations of its own plot and continues to follow Jake LaMotta's fall long after he exits the ring-like watching a man have the final shreds of life squeezed out of him long after he's down.  And yet, at the same time, we do feel for LaMotta's character, beyond all logic and explanation.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is the album that turned me on to Eminem. Its got everything that takes the fun out of watching Television! Its got things your priests, teachers or parents would beat you up for! A super fun album to listen to.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I have to be honest with you, im not a religous person and that might be the reason that i dont like this film. Ive only been to church once (which was very boring i might add). The real problem with this film is that to me its just a guy getting whip and punched for 2 hours. And you know what that doesnt make for a good movie that makes for a movie that is really boring. The most fun i had watching this film was counting the times jesus got hit and cherring for the jews just so i could be on the winning side. <br /> <br />Basiclly if your not a religous person i dont beleve that you will like this movie but if you are religous then you will love this movie (even though you have allready seen it). Me i want my money back from Mel Gibson.
1400049628|5.0|Anyone who has seen a load of zombie films will love this book.  It is essentially a parody of a survival guide for zombie outbreaks using observations from many famous zombie movies and Max Brooks' own warpped mind.  He looks at many facits of zombie survival from the type of weapons and supplies to stockpile to engaging zombies in underwater combat.  The final 70 pages includes \\"recorded\\" zombie attacks which are amazingly hilarious.  Buy this book.
B000002H70|5.0|I heard the Cure a few years ago. I had no idea who they were. About a year ago, I decided to buy one of their albums. I had read a review for 'Disintegraton' and bought that. When I got home, I listened to the entire thing, beginning to end. When I was through, I had smiled and cried.  <br />   This album is poetry. Robert Smith is one of the greatest and most underrated singer/songwriters of our time. His voice is impossible to describe. There are some catchy singles on this album such as 'Love Song' and 'Pictures of You', but there are also some epic songs, like 'The Same Deep Water as You' and 'Disintegration' itself. <br />   Usually, I rate all the songs on the album from 1-10. Every song on this gets a 10. Every song is beautiful and worth it. <br />   If you are even remotely curious about hearing what The Cure have to offer, BUY THIS.  <br />   It is worth 10 stars.
B0002Z0EYA|1.0|Hollywood has managed to do it yet again. Whether its William Wallace in 'Braveheart' (Historical fact,Wallace was actually a murdering, loathsome individual who was either feared or hated by his fellow Scotsmen) or 'U571' and the submarines' capture of the German 'Enigma' code machines in WW2 (Actually captured by HMS Bulldog of the the ROYAL NAVY, the British Navy) you can be sure that Hollywood will not let historical fact get in the way of whatever story is in the frame this month. 'Troy' is no exception. Just watch the film and completely forget that it is supposed to be looking at a period in time of ancient Greek history or mythology and just enjoy it as you would say...'Friends' or 'Pet Detective'. When Hollywood gets hold of anything remotely pertaining to any historical period or event, expect it to change dramatically for the worse! They'll be saying that there was even a  US WW2 pilot who played a significant role in Britains 'survive or die' struggle in 1940 - The Battle of Britain...oh hang on, they already have. (By the way, a genuine American pilot DID  actually fly at the end of the battle but with no confirmed 'kills' but I thank him for his service of course anyway). Expect the film out shortly showing him (Tom Cruise) saving Europe all on his lonesome of course! HOLLYWOOD....PLEASE GET IT RIGHT NOW AND AGAIN!<br /><br />Terry McCormack<br /><br />Fareham<br /><br />Hampshire<br /><br />England
B0001AVZA8|3.0|If I wanted to make a traditional romantic comedy for adults, I'd set it in or around New York, I'd have sophisticated and financially well off characters, I'd thrown in a little british farce, maybe some slightly dated but cool music, and end it at a very romantic location. In a nut shell this is \\"Something's Got to Give\\", it's also \\"You've Got Mail\\" and it's \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" as well as a host of other popular romantic movies. What sets \\"...Give\\" apart is not the story or the direction so much as the acting. Everyone in the cast does a superb job, but it's the chemistry between  Nicholson & Keaton that makes this cliche of a movie work. Maybe it's because they play shadows of themselves or maybe it's because the trust each other, I don't know. I just want then to make more movies together.
0792165020|5.0|When picking out films to see, I usually gravitate toward the \\"small\\" independent type of film usually avoiding the larger \\"major\\" productions.  Thus, I avoided \\"the Talented Mr. Ripley\\" up until recently.  My mistake!  \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" is outstanding and has, to me, everything a movie should have to make it the \\"complete film experience\\"-great script and direction, great acting, wonderful sound tract and beautiful cinematography.  This film has it all!   The acting, by all of the actors, is superb.  Matt Damon, as Tom Ripley is outstanding.  He portrays a very complicated character believably.  At no time are you aware that he is acting.  This character does things that are, indeed, despicable; however, due to the acting skills of Damon, I actually liked the guy and felt deep sympathy and empathy for him and for his desire to be someone else   (I think we all have been there-at least I have-fortunately all of us don't do what Tom Ripley does, in the film, to achieve our wishes).   To me the last scene of the film is fantastic and heart breaking due to Matt Damon giving a gut wrenching performance--the character Tom has finally found someone to love, and has found someone that accepts him as himself but due to past deeds and the need to keep his past hidden, he has to kill the person that could have brought him love and happiness.  As usual, Jude Law, as the playboy and errant son Dickie, is awesome.  He plays a cad but due to his acting skills you, like this cad.  Gwenyth Platrow gives a \\"knock-em dead\\" performance, as Dickie's girlfriend starting out as a plastic rich \\"air-head\\" and ending up as the only one that really knows what has happened to Dickie when he has disappeared and becoming a completely different person because of that knowledge.   Her knock down drag out with the character Tom is great.  Cate Blanchett plays a socialite- debutante-type wonderfully.  The acting alone would have made \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" a great film; however, there ismore!  The film has one of the best sound tracts that I've ever heard.  The sound tract makes use of Renaissance Church music, so-called \\"Classical music\\" \\"cool\\" jazz and one of my favorites I (if not my favorite) pop standards-\\"My Funny Valentine\\" sung wonderfully by Matt Damon.  The sound tract is gorgeous!  What impressed me the most is that Matt Damon and Jude Law took the time to learn to really play the instruments that they were suppose to be playing in the film-Damon, the piano and Law the saxophone.  One of my favorite scenes is in the smoked filled American-jazz nightclub--fabulous.      The recreation of 1950-era Italy is great and it is shot beautifully.     If you want to have an enjoyable film experience, buy this film
B000021Y7X|5.0|I'll admit it, I do not like 80's music. I find it poppy and annoying. But this, thi performance is a work of art. It made a Talking Heads fan out of me. It is not only interesting to watch, building in size and excitement; it'll make you dance whether you want to or not. I cannot say enough about this simple but amazing performance. Buy it, I guarentee you will NOT be disappointed.
B0000028SR|3.0|Its amazing to me all of these people throwing out their Springsteen because of the current political issue.  GROW UP!! <br />Why do I include this here?  Because when this album first came out I was among the many fans extremely dissapointed over the disbanding of E Street.  Now, ten years plus later I know that this was a necessary growth step for Springsteen and that these songs were better than I was able to give them credit for at the time.  As time goes by we learn and opinions change.  If you disagree with what Mr. Springsteen is suggesting than vote for Bush.  Its that simple isn't it?  Don't throw out a fine collection of music like this or Essential or The Rising whatever else you might have DUMMY!!.  As for the album itself while I do still agree the production is a little on the glossy side songs like Human Touch, Cross My Heart, I Wish I Were Blind and Soul Driver have stood up as true gems in the Springsteen cannon.  Also worth a listen is the live \\"Plugged\\" versions as they are done in a more raw and immediate style that better shows their strengths.  Who knows,  you conservatives may find in ten years, as I did, that Bruce (\\"A man brings his country to war over false pretense he loses his job, its not rocket science\\") was right.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Possibly the worst film in the history of the world. I don't think I would be far from wrong in hypothesising that this film was made entirely for the sake of the special effects (like the recent Star Wars movies) and not for the sake of making a good film (like the recent Star Wars movies). I spent the entire film sighing and wishing that it would end. There were so many cliches in the dialogue that after a while I was saying what each character was going to say before they said it. There were so many scenes where people flew around on ropes or got thrown through walls that after the first half hour I was waiting for the next rope or wall scene to show up every five minutes. (Hey, maybe if I'd timed the gaps between each rope and wall scene I'd have had something to do other than watch this film). The plot - oh Lord - I think they got their kids to write it. The writers kept trying to top everything they did, throwing in each new utterly predictable \\"surprise\\" with absolutely no concern for how insulting it would be for anyone with an IQ. As for the special effects - I have a theory that the people who make these movies are so determined to show off their CGI technology that they deliberately make all the effects look like effects. That way people can go, \\"Gee, look at that great effect.\\" Wouldn't it save a lot of time if they just made the CGI effects look real and maybe put a signature or something next to it (e.g., \\"This is a CGI effect made by such-and-such,\\" or even \\"Kilroy was here.\\")? Honestly, this movie was a horrible waste of time and money - my time and my money. I could have had more fun and saved myself a lot of time and money by repeatedly banging my head against a wall for a few minutes. I'd have probably got the same effect too.
B0006213WG|2.0|I bought this CD because I used to like Sum 41 in the old days, when they wrote great original stuff, like on 'Half Hour of Power', and 'All Killer No Filler\\". I read in some reviews that Sum 41 had changed, and their new album was a great, new side of Sum 41. How wrong they were.  <br />The first thing I did was listen it through once. Being a student of music theory, I could instantly tell the chord progressions, which were, mundane and commonplace. Also, being a guitar player, I played several of the songs, and, it turned out that most of the chord progressions were exactly the same than many of their old songs. Even the ones that I didn't recognize as 'used before' were so incredibly simple, so unimaginative, it's hard to believe the Island Records didn't end their contract with them!  <br />However, in the mindless 'Pop-Punk' era, fans will listen to anything. I must admit the melodies are not bad, but anyone who knows the slightest bit about music will be driven up the wall by the childishness of the whole arrangement. It looks like after the success of their first three albums, they are running out of ideas. <br />Some examples of the repetition of the progressions are: 'Pieces' and 'Thanks For Nothing', 'Some Say' and 'Handle This' - the melodies even sound the same!! There are countless more. Another track - 'Slipping Away'- has chords so simple it's just not acceptable!! However there is one song - 'We're All To Blame' which is very original, and should be an example for the rest of the album- but it's not. <br />Another very annoying thing about Sum 41 in general is the lyrics. They are clichd, meaningless, bad grammar sentences, with the main focus on making them rhyme. I recently bought the new Green Day album, which is probably the greatest CD I have ever bought. Now THAT is what I call music- great lyrics, extremely varied style, just...original. <br />Overall 'Chuck' has put me off Sum 41 for the rest of my life. It is mostly because it feels like Ihave just bought a 'Greatest Hits' album containing all the songs I already have. It's too similar. The only difference Sum 41 has made in this album is turn off the distortion in a few songs.   <br />
B0002ZXCY4|4.0|Another mind trip down Arjen Lucassen's melodic and enthralling lane! Ayreon's 3rd full-length album has got yet another story-line prog rock-opera approach, and features many talented vocalists from different bands around the world, such as Threshold, Arena, Marillion, The Gathering, and Within Temptation. The story this time is of 8 characters being plucked from different times of earth (Barbarian, Highlander, Hippie, Egyption, Indian, Roman, Knight, etc as well as Peter Daltry doing narration) by some unknown alien race, and placed through some kind of journey through, yes, an Electric Castle, as well as other places of time and space. Some will live, some will die, etc, etc. The 2-disc newly released version features CD-rom on both discs on the making-of the record, and though the album itself isn't as good as his latest masterpiece \\"The Human Equation\\" there is still plenty to love on this.  <br /> <br />We start off w/ an 11-minute opus \\"Isis and Osiris\\" which is easily the best track off the album. Featuring very atmospheric, and sweetly melodic acoustic guitar, this song features clean male and female vocals which stretch out beautiful harmonies. The songs gets louder when the prog-metal guitars and orchestrations kick in. More of a spacey prog metal track. After this is a more jazz/blues oriented song w/ very big, warm and gruff male vocals but still has an underlying space-prog foundation. The song leads into beautiful female indian chants. All tracks on this first disc are good. There is a plenty mixture of all different forms of music as well as instrumentals. From epic sung arena-rock style choruses to psychodelic passages to melidious opera vocals all with a spacey foundation.  <br />The second disc is where the 4/5 star review really hits. Though there are genuinley good songs on this one, Arjen seems to have a problem (as he did w/ the following record, \\"Flight of the Migrator\\") with overdoing guitar, keyboard, and vocal runs. This along with a morebasic use of metal riffs as well as orchestrations and not many deeply entrancing or hypnotizing vocal harmonies contribute to an overdone collection of songs where only about half will keep you coming back. There are some brilliant vocal layering techniques he uses, so i gotta give him credit for that; most especially on the opening track \\"The Garden of Emotions\\" where in one spot there are 3 different vocalists singing three different sections at the same time, yet it all fits! \\"Evil Devolution\\" is somewhat lazy in that the verse is straightforward and the orchestrated chorus isn't that interesting, plus it's too short. Highlighted tracks here are \\"The Castle Hall\\",\\"Tower of Hope\\" (which unfortunately only really has a good chorus but not much else), and the beautiful 60's/70's prog-rock Beatles influenced \\"Another Time, Another Space.\\"  <br /> <br />What I love most about Arjen is that no matter what type of music you're into, metal or not, anyone can appreciate the fundemental beauty of his music. this isn't just good rock, it isn't just good metal, it isn't just good prog; it's great music for people with great taste in music. I would personally pick this up second to his latest album, because though it's not quite as good it's still got a lot to give. A very atmospheric album delivers, though not all its songs are successes, but at a low price w/ an abundance of good songs, what's stopping you?? All hail Arjen! The Master of Prog!
0385512104|4.0|\\"Chapters in books are usually given the cardinal numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6 and so on. But I have decided to give my chapters prime numbers 2,3,5,7,11,13 and so on because I like prime numbers.\\"<br /><br />So says Christopher Boone, the protagonist, and REAL author of this book. Indeed, this is the first book I have ever read, in which the chapter numbers exceed the page numbers, and it is not the book's only unique feature. Charts, graphs, pictures, maps, photos... all of these media are employed by Mark Haddon, to help us see into the complex mind of the autistic Christopher.<br /><br />When Christopher discovers a neighbor's murdered poodle, he sets out on a quest to unmask the murderer. What he ends up discovering could not be further from his (or the reader's) suspicions.<br /><br />The earth-shattering revelation sends Christopher on a new, and unsuspected journey... one fraught with nerve-rattling moments of sensory overload as he narrowly escapes (time and again) from those who would try to thwart his progress.<br /><br />It is a story of the hero's journey, the hero being equipped, in this case, with nothing other than amazingly keen powers of observation, a (thankfully) unused Swiss-Army knife, his father's bank-access card, and an unswerving desire to re-identify with the love and acceptance of his parents.<br /><br />I found the book very unputdownable. For all of its digressions, it remains fast-paced, exciting, swift, engaging and wonderfully witty.
B000000OQF|5.0|Their best. Definitely.  i've outlined the songs below: <br />1.Welcome to the Jungle-5/5- A great opener- a perfect song.  Axl sounds great.  Slash sounds great.  Everyone sounds great in this song. <br />2.I'ts so easy-3/5- Nothing to write home about.  just a passing song. <br />3.Nightrain-5/5-What a song!  It is amazing!  Not to be missed.  Why the hell isn't it on the greatest hits- it should be!!  Slash does some immense guitar skills in this.  Starts off kind of AC/DC style and then gets progressively harder. <br />4.Out ta get me-5/5- Another goodun.  Some good strong vocals. <br />5.Mr. Brownstone-4/5-Begins crap but gets better. <br />6.Paradise City-5/5- WHAT AN AMAZING SONG! Starts off real well with acoustic guitar and heavy drums and then it gets proper GNR when it breaks into distortion guitar- the guitar at the end- well just hear it.  It'll be love at first listen! <br />7.My Michelle-5/5-Really good.  Starts off really quiet then breaks off into extremely heavy distortion guitar.  Possibly the heaviest on the album. <br />8. Think about you-3/5- just another passing song <br />9. Sweet Child o' mine-5/5- Possibly by far the best.  It's my favourite anyway.  It starts more rock than heavy metal, but have you heard the guitar solo?  You should.  That's where it turns proper heavy metal.  Amazingly fast- on a par with Eddie Van Halen speed.  One of my favourite all time songs. Great intro riff too. <br />10.You're Crazy-4/5- The fastest on the album, a good song, but at times I feel it is a bit too fast. <br />11.Anything goes-3/5- A bit crap to be honest- but hey! It's the only crap one on the album. <br />12. Rocket Queen-5/5- A GREAT ender. Truly stunning.  Starts off kinda soft, but then Slash takes it into a new section with a different tune, with a heavy but very tuneful melody.  The vocals build up with great backing guitar, to a climax of a victorious end, leaving the listener on a high after listening to the song. <br /> <br />So that's my review.  This album is not only filled with great songs but also great lyrics.  I seriously advise getting it, even if you are not a big heavy metal fan.  Anyway, how can sales of 14 million be misleading? <br /> <br />Cheers. <br />Craggaz(it's not my real name) <br /> <br />
1400032717|5.0|This short novel is written from the perspective of it's main character, an autistic boy. In an often bewildering, over-logical style this gives a humoristic perspective on some incidents going on. Although the humor will make you often smile, there is a serious undercurrent.  <br />The strength in this book is in the respect with which the author treats the way of thinking of the autistic character. Thus creating an imporession of the world that is sincere representation of an autistic world, which to us, is often funny.
1892005034|5.0|Marshall Rosenberg's Nonviolent Communication practice gives people a practical tool for manifesting spiritual principles like nothing I have ever seen before.  NVC empowers us to create a quality of connection with other people that makes it much more likely we can have peace, harmony, and resolution in our conflicts.
B0002EXH4A|3.0|Megadeth reached the peak of their career with this album, afterwards it went downhill fast. The good thing with this album when it came out 1988 was its unique and thrashy sound that was partly due to the production. This remaster takes that away, it's like all the atmosphere is gone. It's still a good album though but get the original that came out 1988 if you can. By the way this album slays anything metallica has ever done! Master of puppets, eat my shorts!!! Dave Mustaine is the true metal hero!!!!
B00003CXXI|5.0|Shrek was hilarious!  There was so much comedy, and the story was so entertaining.  The characters were memorable, and each had something to offer.  For example, Shrek offered his loner personality, and yet, showed feelings for the brave and independant Princess Fiona.  Donkey is yet another comical character that deserves a lot of credit!  I think he is the best character I've ever seen Eddie Murphy play.  Even my parents thought this movie was funny, which shows that it's not childish humor.  The setting of the movie was interesting and original, too: A medieval fairy-tale land.   <br /> <br />Overall, I would say this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!  I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh, but parents who don't approve of \\"potty humor\\" might find it to be crude.  Like I said, though, I think it's hilarious, and worth a watch.
B0002EXH54|5.0|You don't want to miss out on this piece of thrash. Remaster or original doesn't matter, get them both just in case!! This album made Megadeth the kings of metal and it would only get better on the next album!
B00005JKCH|4.0|I saw Spider-Man 2 before the original Spider-Man, and I have to say, I think the 2nd movie was a big improvement of the 1st.  Not that the original movie was bad, but I personally think the 2nd movie was better.  You have to see the 1st movie to understand quite a bit of the 1st movie, though.      I think Tobey Maguire plays the role of Peter Parker very well in this movie, as does Kirsten Dunst with Mary-Jane.  I personally love Kirsten's hair red, and I think it looks much prettier long then cropped.  Anyway, I found the Green Goblin's outfit to be rather poorly made, and quite fake in appearance.  The Green Goblin himself was a tad unreal, too.  But the movie still had a lot of action, adventure, and what made the 2nd movie so good, romance.      Overall, I would say that if you plan on seeing the 2nd movie, enjoy movies about superheros, are a Spider-Man fan, or are a Tobey Maguire or Kirsten Dunst fan, you will probably enjoy this movie.
B0002EXH5O|2.0|This remaster is worse then St.Anger. Get the original at any cost!! RIP is the last good effort from megadeth although it is a bit stiff. If you want flawless flowing thrash check out their earlier works.
B0006213WG|4.0|...but it's been taking up space in my CD player since I bought it. They sound a lot different from their previous release, but I feel like it's an improvement. More than Metallica like previous reviews have said, I hear an influence from System of a Down, which is a good band to mimick. A step in the right direction, I would definately reccommend this CD to almost anyone who stumbled upon this page.
B00004SA86|5.0|Mahler... Ahh, whenever I hear that name, I almost emmediately think of the blazing Coda of Symphony No. 1, Which I think Kubelik does the very best. The Entire first symphony is very much alive, as it should be, considering Mahler's young age, when he wrote it. It's full of enthusiasm and love, also terrible pain, which eventually resolves into a triumphant closing with 7 horns, 4 trumpets, and 3 trombones playing \\"victory\\" fanfares.  <br /> <br />The second symphony is very dark in the first movement, full of death! After that comes the lightness of the second movement, which should be performed in a very Viennese manner, which Kubelik conveys surely and clearly. The 3rd movement, should be nervous, which it is, and the great \\"cry of despair\\" is breathtaking. The 4th movement, sung softly, and touchingly, is a beautiful view of God leading one into eternal bliss. The Finale is wonderful, a musical view of \\"DIES IRAE\\", the end of days, graves opening, the dead rising, judgement... Wait! Mahler said \\"There is no judgement!\\" All is peace! HEAVEN! HEAVEN! HEAVEN! ETERNALLY!!!  <br /> <br />Symphony No. 3 is a natural phenomenon. The first movement, is a powerful spring march, \\"What the mountains tell me\\". The second movement is \\"What the flowers in the meadow tell me\\". Also very viennese. 3rd mvt. is the \\"Animal\\" movement, with a posthorn solo in the middle, played very well. The fourth movement concerns Man... The Midnight song from Zarathustra by Nietsche. The fifth movement rises to the realms of Angels, a boy's choir, and women's choir, with bells, and light woodwinds sing about heaven. (Mahler was obsessed with the idea of heaven) The Last movement is a broad adagio, in which the music moves from a calm peacefulness to a powerful \\"portrait of God\\", the movement was called \\"What Love tells me\\", could also be called \\"What God tells me\\", since God can be comprehended only as Love. <br /> <br />The fourth symphony, is the smallest of the brethren... No trombones or tuba... A graceful first movement, followed by a deathly scherzo, with a mistuned violin, to imitate the fiddle of death. The third movement is called \\"The smile of St. Ursula\\" a slow variations movement, with a beautiful highpoint, in which the \\"Heaven\\" theme is played on horns and trumpets. The finale, is a nave song of a child's view of heaven. One interesting parenthesis, is that in this recording, the soprano, Elsie Morrison, is Rafael Kubelik's wife!  <br /> <br />The fifth is the most popular of Mahler's symphonies, mainly thanks to the Adagietto, used in the film \\"Death in Venice\\". The Adagietto was written as a proposal to Mahler's fiance, Alma Schindler. They married shortly after this. The first movement is a funeral march, opening with a trumpet solo. The tension in the beginning of this movement is immense! The second movement is actually the main movement, in sonata form. Very violent and angry music. The third movement is a scherzo. Then the Adagietto, scored for strings and Harp only. a 10-minute piece, which is full of softness and passion, LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! The Finale is a D major Rondo, with a secondary theme borrowed from the Adagietto, and the symphony ends happily. <br /> <br />The sixth is commonly known as the \\"Tragic\\", because it doesn't end positively like the others of Mahler's symphonies. Marches and violent outbursts, soft love, and passion, all is in this music. The end is simply crushing! BANG! The hammer of death blows one last time... Putting an end to this life... <br /> <br />Symphony No. 7, can be called \\"Nachtwanderung\\", because the mood in it is that of the night. A very impressive first movement, opening with a Tenorhorn solo. The second mvt, is called \\"Nachtmusik\\". The third is a spooky scherzo, \\"Schattenhaft\\", shadowlike... The fourth movement is a second \\"Nachtmusik\\", Andante Amoroso, with guitar and mandolin. The Finale is bright C major, the day is come! Bright, glorious morning! It opens with a timpani solo \\"Mit bravour\\".  <br /> <br />The eighth, the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", is very well played and sung. Almost too long and complex to write about, the first movement is a 25-minute hymn to the holy ghost, \\"Veni Creator Spiritus\\", and the second movement is a musical adaption of the final scene from Goethe's \\"Faust II\\", My favourite part of the movement, is Doktor Marianus solos, the \\"Jungfrau, rein im schnstem sinne\\", and the \\"Blicket auf\\". The final chorus, \\"Alles vergngliche\\" is incredible, beginning from a ppp slowly growing into a blazing torrent of sound, in fff! In the final instrumental coda, 5 trumpets, and 3 trombones are added, belting out the \\"Veni\\" theme from the first movement, to round this gigantic work off to a close. <br /> <br />The ninth symphony is about death. In the finale, Mahler sings, aye, sings, from the deep of his soul, his thanks to this life, this world, nature, God, everything! A very moving piece. <br /> <br />The First movement of the 10th symphony, is a new style in Mahler's music, and I have to say, I enjoy listening to it the most, at night, with the lights turned down, with a glass of wine... Just letting the music pour over me, fill my soul... Very nice! <br /> <br />So, to round this review off, I'd say that the First, Second, Third, Eighth, and Tenth make this set worth buying. To get another good second, try Chailly's. For another excellent eighth, Chailly again. Fifth and Sixth? Try Karajan... Ninth... That would be Karajan again, perhaps Klemperer... Fourth? Any recording will do, but for a really good one, here it is! The Seventh is way too slow in Klemperer's reading, but for a breathtakingly powerful Finale, get the Live recording of Abbado's with BPO. The tenth (The whole thing)... Chailly or Sir Simon Rattle.
B0002Y69NG|3.0|I'm a big The Matrix fan. Don't get me wrong, the first movie blew my mind and made me squeal with fangirlish delight. Mr. Smith practically made me melt into a puddle of happy teenage goo when I saw it. The first movie was brilliant.    They should have left it at that.    The second movie, Reloaded, is all right. Not as good as the first, but really, who expects a squeal to add up to the original? We really should have learned that by now. Getting rid of Bullet Time and doing almost everything with computer graphics took away from the movie, and all the philosophy they threw at you seemed rather disjointed and.. dumb. But all in all, Reloaded was worth the money I shelled out to see it, and it's worth buying on DVD if you go for this sort of thing.    Revolutions, however, was to Matrix fans what the last episode of Neon Genesis Evangelion was to anime fans. It's just the Wachowski brothers flipping us off and saying 'deal with it, idiots, cause this is all you're getting and we have your money'. It was crap, it insulted me as a fan of this series. I would not buy it on it's own, and I will not watch it again. I can't keep typing about that movie or I will grow angry about it.    The Animatrix, while beautifully animated, borders on boring half the time. Most of the stories aren't worth watching, and the few good ones don't seem good enough to buy the DVD for, especially since it makes frequent appearances on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network.    The extra DVDs, the 'Revisted's, I have not viewed, but I really wasn't all that interested in how the movies were made, what experiences the cast went through, and all that junk. Perhaps they're worth it, perhaps not. If you typically watch the extra DVDs that come with movies, though, I'd imagine you'd enjoy them.    So if we have this set here, with all of it together, I say if you liked at least 2 of the 4 main DVDs in the set, go ahead and buy it. I probably will, and I'll just ignore the Revolutions DVD flat out. If youonly liked one of the movies, don't even bother.    But considering how cheap it is, I may as well.
B00006HBUB|5.0|I bought the scooby-doo2 monsters unleashed 1st. This wasn't available from Walmart when I wanted it. <br /> <br />My interest in this is based on Sarah Michelle Gellar. I've enjoyed everything she's done so far. This was better than scooby-doo2, but then sequels seldom live up to the original. <br /> <br />It has a PG rating which invalidates those ratings talking about how it will scare small children. And restates the obvious that this is NOT a movie for children. <br /> <br />This wasn't written for small children. It's in the same category as the word 'Campy'. It has subtle innuendo, and is aimed at the teen market and older. <br /> <br />It was enjoyable for the high quality sets, and story line. <br />I rated this 5 out of 5, and scooby-doo2 4 out of 5. <br />
068987474X|5.0|This is definitely a book catering women, particularly women that had their heart broken by the wrong men.  The book offers wisdom and allows women to see the irritating men behavior in a brutally honest way.  I would say this.  If you are experiencing a serious heart break, this book is NOT recommended.  You want other books that are lighter to at least make you feel grounded first.  This book will create lots of anger you have on this man who just broke your heart and you do not need books to stir up your anger.  If you have a big ego about yourself (which probably will make you feel really good because you have too much pride about yourself), please put the book down because this book will serve your ego.  Your ego does not bring you happiness and personal fulfillment.  Later, you will just ask yourself why your Mr. Perfect guy has not shown up.  This will make you feel miserable.   <br /> <br />However, if this book helps you to bring the problems/issues to the surface and realize the honest truth - \\"He's just not that into me\\", go read it.  If you decide the \\"your fantasy about the guy\\" is ruining your life, or giving you false hope about the relationship, it is better to take the belief that \\"He's just not that into me\\" than dwelling on.  Why?  Because we women just deserve so much better.   <br /> <br />Of course I think men are complicated.  Men are human beings and they are of course capable in having complex emotions that they cannot even acknowledge.  A breakup from a guy is hard to take.  I admit it because I had it twice and each time is devastating.  It makes me seem like I worth less.  To realize those two men are not that into me is tough because carrying onto those fantasies are supposed to validate my self-esteem.  However, that is not the truth.   <br /> <br />Why hang on to the fantasy of these men might ask me back (or change) in order to validate I am a worthy person?  Why can't I be happy about myself and be self-reliant?  Why should I ask someone else to bring me happiness, especially the guy who has just broken my heart?  Why should I look outside for love when the most important thing in life is about loving myself?   <br /> <br />We women are taught to be understanding, gentle, loving and most important of all - selfless.  I hate to see women being selfless because we are all so beautiful and worthy individuals.  Why should we diminish ourselves just because these men/jerks break our heart?  Yes, we need to understand some of these men/jerks have their own psychological issues and/or maybe they are just not that into us.  Some probably went through tough lives, tough divorces.  Some are commitment phobic.  Some does not know who they are.  Some cannot acknowledge their inner most daemons and fears.  Some just does not get the meaning of relationships but pretend they know it all.  We need to understand and be sympathetic.  Don't get me wrong.  They crossed our lives and we were in love with them.  Of course it is hard to let go of them.  However, why should we treat ourselves terrible (be around with them when we feel terrible about it) and be their \\"therapist\\" hoping they will change, while all we need to do is to clearly draw the line and move on?   <br /> <br />I am a person that walked through a transformation process as a human being.  I can tell you that people do not change from their old pattern easily if they do not feel the need to.  They just do not unless something hard hits them.  How do I know?  Because I was one of them.  It does not matter whether you are a man or a woman.  People change only when they truly realize the need to change for the better.  We do not have the power to change any other individuals except ourselves.  These men who treated women like \\"crap\\" just need to realize it on their own about why they have those issues or if they are simply just not that into the person.  If you are the lucky one, maybe this man will one day realize their behavior and apologize.  However, it is not your job to wait.  It is not your job to be their therapist (they can pay to see a therapist if they want.  They can get books.  Be real - you are not the professional).  It is certainly not your job to change them because they will not change for you (especially if they are just not that into you and/or they have psychological issues).  Your job is to love yourself and to take very good care of yourself.  Your job is to not to judge yourself because he broke your heart.  Your job is to be gentle to yourself and avoid self-defeating words.  Your job is to heal your heart and be happy on your own.  Your job is to find ways to break away from him, run away from him as far as you can.  Trust me, if it was meant to be, he will one day chase you down and find you.  If it was meant to be, your heart will heal first and then somehow both of your lives will merge again and find each other.  Otherwise, if he isn't that into you and it is not meant to be, why do you want to be with someone while you are fully capable loving and caring yourself?  You deserve better.  <br /> <br />I like what the author had in the last section, listing the qualities about who you want to date.  This is what my therapist told me to do and it brings consciousness about who I want to be with.  It is nothing about judging the men who has broken my heart.  However, it is about whom I feel I deserve to be with.  If creating a list of qualities about a man you want to be with serves your ego, stop it and learn how to let go of that ego first.  However, if the list helps you to build up your self-esteem and helps you realize who a person you want to be with, go ahead and do it!  You will benefit from it.                <br />
B000003TAB|4.0|-Why did you review this? You've probably never even heard of this album! And if you're going to talk about that 'Appetite for Destruction' hairmetal bulls**t then go talk about it in a review for that album. Well I actually like 'Welcome to the Jungle' and 'Sweet Child o' Mine' but that was all, hah! Now I'm reviewing the album! But seriously dude, I'm almost positive you've never thought this existed much less even listened to it, this was not a big album, it didn't even go platinum. You probably saw it right next to Nevermind and decided to give it a horrid review just because it was Nirvana! One thing: LISTEN BEFORE YOU REVIEW! <br />  About this album: I actually enjoy it, it isn't my personal favorite of the bands but its still good. I recommend it for die-hards and other big Nirvana fans.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|If you are thinking about buying this movie,don't!This has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a really long time.The special effects are not that special and the acting by Dracula's brides is simply laughable.While Dracula himself could use a little charisma.The only redeemable thing about the whole movie is Kate Beckinsale and the few scenes of Hugh Jackman shirtless.
B00005JNEI|5.0|What could I say that has not been said about the Bush family?  And why dosen't everyone in the United States see his stupidity, the lack of leadership ability he has demonstrated, not only as a President, but as a private sector leader of failed companies? <br />Anyone smart or not can see and hear his stupidity. He speaks to people like him, not to the American people as a country.  His Father has bailed him out of everything he has evey done. He does not care about you, he cares more about his dogs on his Texas ranch than he does about me, you, or this country.  Michael Moore, you are a great man. Why don't you run for President.  You would make a great one because you have what it take to get the job done and this film serves as your resume to that fact. I truly respect you and wish you continued success.  If you, the American people, don't buy anything else, buy this film. I myself have been in the professional video, audio and film business for 20 years and Fahrenheit 9/11 is one of the best films of it's kind I have ever seen.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Rather than Radiohead, I hear a lot of Remy Zero circa Villa Elaine.  Not much Radiohead here, but still a fine album.
B00005JMXX|1.0|This was the most horrific acting I've seen in a long time! And I don't think it had to do with the actors personally, but the dialogue from the script and the story/plot line. It was hard to like or feel connected with any of the characters- and half the time you're thinking- what are they doing? I just wanted the movie to end and it felt like it never was going to. Some advice-Don't waste your time or money on this one-unless you're really desperate for a movie to rent.
B00000099Y|1.0|It started off as a nice little idea about providing the angsty disenfranchised young people of today with an alternative to hip hop metal but now it's got silly.    The recipe for success of the most lauded and hyped band of the past 30 years or so:        6 teaspoons musical competence  87 oz creepy lead singer  24 lbs Tony Iommi guitar mimicry  840 fl oz. faux mysticism  18 tablespoons potty mouth lyrics        Put in a mixing bowl and whisk for 666 minutes. Then put into Satans crucible and cook until crap brown, or wait until Saturn rises in the House Of Gemini and The Secret Of Existence appears to you among the lyrics of Stinkfist and then you UNDERSTAND....        Come on Tool are for people in an HP Lovecraft phase. I bet you're all trying to obtain a copy of The Necronomicon too right? And maybe some original copies of Metal Hurlant? Autographed Moebius posters? And a skull shaped Mary Jane pipe? Well we all grow up eventually. Face it bands are divided into \\"bands it's cool to be into\\" and \\"whipping boys\\". It's a black and white definition. Music is sometimes of trivial importance in the never ending search for credibility. And Tool are one of tbe lucky ones who make it into the \\"cool to be into\\" category. This album should be shoved up  Maynard James Keenans bottom as an enema!     In truth I wouldn't give this 1 star, maybe 2, but since you all praise the everloving crap out of this band I consider it my duty as an impartial moderator to totally annoy you.
B000002H33|5.0|This is a classic album from a band who had it all fuigured out, then tried to turn commercial, which along with their half-assed attempt to become an alternative band led to their downfall. Anyway, Master of Puppets is one of the greatest thrash album ever recoded, and there is not a single flaw. Every song is delivered perfectly, and Cliff's bass combined with buzzing guitars creates a thick sound, for a tight album. Even the longer pieces have great clarity, and don't run off track. This was the last GREAT Metallica album, and although And Justice For All was also quite good and expirimental, it was the intro for the Black Album, which was the begining of the end for Metallica. Master of Puppets is the definitive Metallica Album and can be put to the same standard as Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood.\\" If you don't own this album, you should concentrate on getting it.
B00005JMXX|3.0|I would actually give this about 3 & 1/2 stars, but this really would have been a better movie if it was presented as a \\"what if\\" documentary instead of trying so hard to be an epic. The special effects are best on the big screen. It tries to answer the question \\"what is global warming and what could happen if it goes unchecked?\\" What if the effects were not going to take 100 or 1,000 years to show up, what if they happened the day after tommorow? It actually gives some explanations about how the climate works and definitions of how it's affected by warming and what could happen eventually that are worth knowing about. They try to humanize the special effects with stories about people caught in the various storms. They focus mainly on Dennis Quaid's family: he's been trying to ring the warning bells without sucess for a long time and then it's too late, his son is stuck in N.Y. as the storm hits, he tries to overcome impossible odds to get to his son, his estranged wife is a doctor who refuses to leave a very young cancer patient alone in a hospital, his son is trying to survive a the \\"storm of the century\\" with his friends. The real problem with this movie is that there is too much going on for it to be as tightly focused as it needs to be because they're trying too hard to make both an ecological and political statement. <br /> <br />It also features a younger President with an older V.P., who feel the economic cost of doing something about global warming is too high to warrant action, especially since it can't be determined exactly what will happen and when. Does that sound at all familiar to you? The only things missing were a Presidental/V.P financial stake in the continued high use of fossil fuels and a seven minute shot of the President sitting in a chair looking dumbfounded when he heard about the devastation in New York. But then it would just have been Fahrenheit -911 instead.  <br /> <br />Those with a child-like wish to have the President pay for his mistakes and see the VP both admit to and apologize for his mistakes (instead of saying \\"go #&@$ yourself\\") may be gratified by this movie. I'm glad I saw it, I get the dangers of global warming, but it's jut not a \\"must buy\\" movie for me. <br />
B000000OSE|4.0|1. Right Next Door To Hell: A quicken, with good verses, but the slightly annoying chorus kind of brings it down. 7/10 <br />2. Dust N' Bones: One of the highlights here. Not the fastest, or loudest, but it makes up in songwriting and arrangement. This song isn't tiring in any way, shape, or form. Great song. 10/10 <br />3. Live And Let Die: Very good song, but Duff's singing in the backgroud is just plain gay. However, once Slash get going on the melody riff, you'd wish this song were longer. It's not quite perfect though...9/10 <br />4. Don't Cry: Uhmm, this song is rather broing, and if it weren't for the solo I'd probably skip it. It's ok, but it's just not for me. 6/10 <br />5. Perfect Crime: A speed rocker, and it gets to the point with a very blunt chorus. Not the greatest, but nevertheless...8.5/10 <br />6. You Ain't The First: I don't like anything about this song, other than the fact that it's short. An acoustic Izzy song, and it's just sloppy. 3.5/10 <br />7. Bad Obsession: This song has a cool feel to it, and it features strong piano/keyboards/organ. Meanders on a little too long, but it's still listenable. 8.5/10 <br />8. Back Off Bitch: An avarege rocker, although the chorus doesn't really work for me. 7/10 <br />9. Double Talkin' Jive: Another highlight, and this song on the other hand, has a GREAT chorus. It's short and to the point, and it will get a 10/10 <br />10. November Rain: Alright...I personally think this song is a little overblown, but at least, with it's highly accented production, it doesn't feel loose or choppy. I really am not sure what to give this song for a review, but it is quite good. 9/10 <br />11. The Garden: Not bad, althoguh Alice's part has some odd lyrics. Despite Slash's best efforts, this song kinda overstays its welcome. 8/10 <br />12. Garden Of Eden: Very Quick. Another speedy one, but it's got better arrangement. Not bad...9/10 <br />13. Don't Damn Me: Actually one of the better songs on here. It's one of the longer ones, but is tight nonetheless. This song has an excellent chorus. Ahh...what the hell...10/10 <br />14. Bad Apples: This song has a funny chorus, and a great solo, too. Other than that it's kinda boring, but it's a good song. 8.5/10 <br />15. Dead Horse: The acoustic guitar at the begining AND end (whcih sounds completely out of place), drags the song down. Plus, what's in between those acoustic parts is rather meh. 6/10 <br />16. Coma: Well, I might go as far as to say this is the best song on here. There are many different parts, and the main riff is just awesome. Suprisingly, Slash only has 1 solo (which is odd considering the song is 10 minutes). But what this song lacks it more than compensates with a great ending, and some intersting parts where orther voices come in and start talking all at once. It's really very cool, and you'd have to listen to it to understand. 20/10 Great Closer!
0399241515|5.0|Scorpia being the sixth book in the Alex Rider Adventure Series, it shows that Anthony Horowitz is absolutely trying his best. In the previous book, Eagle Strike, Alex found out that his uncle was a contract killer, same as Yassen, who was also a killer. Alex always thought that his uncle was MI6, but he was wrong. In this book, Alex had two choices, go back to MI6, or join Scorpia to take revenge and fight the MI6s. Really exciting book with minute to minute excitement wanted by everybody. When you finished the first page, you won't put it down, because Horowitz already gripped you in. READ ON!
0060012331|4.0|Ok, I have not read any of the Discworld series at this point in time, but the title struck me as a bit of an allusion or, oppositely, an originator for Mr. Bobo's Mouse Circus in Neil Gaimans \\"Coraline\\" (great book, for a kids book)...does it interest anyone to know that Gaiman and Pratchett intersected about 1990 or so to write a novel together, \\"Good Omens\\" (another kick-nuts book)?

0393035158|3.0|After I read an excerpt in the LA Times, I couldn't believe that the paper was publishing Harris' views. Two of my students were working on essays exploring the concepts of jihad and holy wars, so I recommended they check out Harris' argument. I've just finished the book myself, and it feels like an author's first work, with all of the energy and passion on one hand, and the grad student's (I was one too) desire to fill one's document with all of one's reading, thinking, and experiences--however tangential to the whole.<br /><br />The enthusiasm Harris brings to his thesis carries you along, but with (as he acknowledges readers often do, late in his text) a tendency to skim as you go. The neuroscientific and philosophical byways do not always end up supporting his larger points, and the enormous space given his admittedly thoughtful footnotes may point to a problem he and his editors faced when assembling his shorter but still rambling musings into a more cohesive form. I'm still puzzling over his closing statement that mysticism is more rational than religion, but it's a good koan upon which to meditate!<br /><br />His instruction that if all of us simply answered our children's questions honestly, the problems caused by unjustified dogmatic positions and unproveable belief would end appeals to me as does his assertion that we need a stronger force to end dissension caused by religious intolerance's alliance with world-ending technology. But, like many rational claims, how we could go about this seems as unsolvable a dilemma as how to forget that we know how to blow the world up in the name of a deity or a secularized creed.<br /><br />Humanists for centuries have been advancing such claims, at least since Voltaire, and, as Harris emphasizes, our world's in far more danger now that intolerance carries a nuclear and biological key to open Pandora's box once and for all. I recommend his book for its often bitterly amusing archness, its insights into the warped policies historically and currently advanced by (mid)East and Western regimes, and his defense of mystic and not religious introspection--muddled but nonetheless demanding consideration, at least on an individual level.  His desire, however, to put neuroscience, often arcane philosophical debate, and somewhat unclear analogies from these to bolster his ethical position does weaken the stability of his broader, often idealistic and impractical claims in the cause of a secular humanism that would somehow replace our habitual credulity. All in all, congratulations to him for stirring up a too complacent embrace of wobbly tolerance and patronizing acceptance of what in fact, as Harris labors mightily if too clumsily to reveal, are dangerous and life-threatening calls to destroy us all in the name of an unknowable, irrational apocalyptic eschatology.policies historically and currently advanced by (mid)East and Western regimes, and his defense of mystic and not religious introspection--muddled but nonetheless demanding consideration, at least on an individual level.

B00005JLYW|1.0|I tried very hard to get into Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, but it's so bad I think slitting my own throat would have been more fun. I ended up just channel surfing the night away. I can't believe crap such as this gets made year after year, guess that's what happens when you replace studio heads with clueless MBA clones that can't make a decision without consulting the day's horoscopes. Even more upsetting are \\"directors\\" like McG who kept getting gigs without showing an ounce of ability to tell a story, or direct for that matter. I think I can do better working from my trash bin of bad ideas than McG can on his best days, and I only have half a brain!
B00000GAIW|5.0|-Creative-Challenging-Irreverent-Amazing-Solid-Incedible. Aqualung stands as a masterpiece in the history of Rock as so many things. At this point in Tull history, Anderson had taken the band fom blues to folk and now to progressive folk-rock. Ther song Aqualung stands as Tull's best normal length song. And more timeless songs follow...you become hooked. Tull will intoxicate you with revolutionary conceptual irreverance. As a Christian, I would avoid 'My God' and 'Hymn 43', but everything else I find acceptable-to-slightly offensive. If I could own only one Tull record, it would be Aqualung. It is undoubtably their greatest achievement.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|The film consist solely of interviews with one Robert Strange McNamara (yes that's a real middle name), who as Secretary of Defense was involved in the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War, not to mention the firebombing of Japan while serving in WWII. His story is roughly divided into 11 lessons, with the majority of them devoted to the Vietnam War. This is really a fascinating look back on our own history, where events become frighteningly demystified over the course of the film. Highlights include discussions on how close we came to full out nuclear war over Cuba, and how he would have been tried as a war criminal had U.S. lost WWII for firebombing Japan, where more than half of the civilian populations in dozens of Japanese cities were killed. Morris smartly didn't allow the film to degenerate into a talking head picture by using various archival footage and computer graphics, among other things, to counterpoint McNamara's statements visually. Morris employed that method with a high degree of effectiveness, and along with McNamara's engaging personality and surprising candor made sure we were never bored. Perhaps the most chilling aspect of the film is the discussion of the Vietnam War, which errily parallels our current war with Iraq in too many areas. You would think the mistakes made and the lessons learned from Vietnam would be applied today, but all we are doing is recycling the same mistakes and uncovering new ones. This should be a required viewing of any presidential administration and we can only hope the situation in Iraq doesn't deteriorate as badly as it did in Vietnam.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Dream Theater-past their musical height? I don't think so. This newest release showcases their new musical direction: prog metal. Dream Theater has gone for a heavy sound, but ToT is distinctly a melodic metal album. Dream Theater, a prog band, does lots of instrumental work which I find awesome, as a proghead. If you are not into bands like Genesis, Yes, and Kansas, you might not think so. I find particularly amazing John Petrucci's guitar work in the instrumental sections of This Dying Soul, probably the most striking track. Overall this is a solid release from an amazing band
B00008EY65|2.0|What a major disappointment. Maybe I expected too much from Guillermo del Toro, but is this the same guy that made the great Cronos and The Devil's Backbone, not to mention the at least entertaining Blade II. Why do directors always screw up their dream projects? This movie had one great character (the sardonic Hellboy) and one cool villain sidekick (knife wielding Kroenen) trapped in a clich&eacute;d story that never went anywhere. I think del Toro just got too ambitious and bite off more than he could chew, trying in vain to juggle too many things at once. Sometimes that is admirable, but not when the whole things turned into such a complete mess. There is a director's version DVD coming out later this year of course, but since it's longer and not shorter, I doubt it will stop the film from simply clonking along.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Moore is great at what he does: Spinning a series of video clips to match his personal view of the issue. This movie is no exception. It's not at all a documentary, and if you know that, and loath/hate George Bush, and don't like to research the facts of a situation, but let a filmmaker with a hardcore view of the world dictate your views to you, you'll love this movie. LOVE it.
B00004Z459|4.0|SHUT THE F**K UP!  NO, they are not the most original band out there.  YES, some of their chords and techniques are simple.  But ease off, people! <br /> <br />It's still music.  I really enjoy their rap/alt style, and simple though their lyrics may be, they are quite enjoyable.  And what's all this obsession about hardcoreness?  WHO GIVES A RAT'S ASS?  The point of music is to be GOOD, not just HARD.  If you want hard, all you need to do is go outside with a cheap electric guitar and a karaoke machine.  turn them both to max, play the lowest key on the bass, and scream as loud as you can.  WHOOPDIDOO!! HARDCORE!  but GOOD??? NO! <br /> <br />Linkin park is not hardcore, but they are GOOD.  And that's why this CD is so successful- because people didn't care whether or not it was unoriginal or not hardcore or stupid or simple- they just cared about it being good.  This IS good music.
068987474X|5.0|I'm an avid fan of \\"Sex and the City.\\"  So it was with a sense of deja vu that I read the title of this book, \\"He's Just Not That Into You.\\"  This phrase was the mantra that freed Miranda from the usual vicious cycle of obsessing over the vagaries of male dating behavior. <br /> <br />Detractors have pointed out that the observations of this book are too simplistic, given the complexities of human behavior.  Yes, the human male is a complex animal BUT sometimes the information one needs is just that simple:  \\"He's just not that into you.\\"  Note that the phrase doesn't need to specify WHY or HOW he's not into you; he just is NOT.  Consider it a \\"get out of emotional jail free\\" card. <br /> <br />I'd also like to point out that the observations of this nifty little book apply not only to women but to gay males as well; to anyone who has had less-than-satisfactory romantic dealings with a man. <br /> <br />I just love it.
B000000H5J|5.0|The first FF song i heard was Linchpin, which is why i never really liked them. Then i heard this album and have etched the word Demanufacture into my skull. Each song takes you on a journey, from the no turning back attitude of Demanufacture(the hardest song on the cd) to the melodic Zero Signal which to me is symbolizing trying to communicate with God and not getting an answer. <br /> <br />Songs to check out-- <br />Demanufacture <br />Zero Signal <br />Pisschrist
B000002HH9|2.0|To this day, Wild Mood Swings is my least favorite and least played Cure album.  They attempt to do dance music on this one, yet never really pull it off in most cases.  Most of the album never grabbed me.  Only The 13th was the best song. The '96 songs that were selected for '97's Galore are the ones I skip the most on that CD.  Robert Smith's writing and the band's music seemed to have lost ground.  I don't think they recovered after this one.
B00008EY65|1.0|I fell asleep watching this movie. Although the special effects are good, the movie falls short of anything resembling \\"entertaining\\" or \\"worth watching.\\" People who like the comic books or other silly sci-fi-action movies will like this film, but if you like interesting/good/not awful movies, skip this one.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|...Pistache .... the script is along the lines of the original Baron F. creation .... bits and pieces borrowed from Polanski, Whale, Coppola, Murnau, etc. etc. etc. even a nod to \\"Q\\" from the Bond series [yawn!]<br /><br />Great effects, but that's about it - add a lackluster cast, and what do you have - something for pre-teens, nothing sophisticated.<br /><br />The heroine does not shave under the arms [that odd ill-fitting red ball gown!] - she's also rather quaintly referred to as Romany Royalty ..... where's the garlic?  The Hero? - a vaguely sketched J.

B000059Z8J|5.0|It is a rare event when a great story, perfect casting, excellent acting, prescient directing, and an absolutely stellar score come together in a single movie.  However, when you add to that mix a person who could take an iconic figure like Superman, and give him a heart and soul that embraces everything good and right in the world; you then have the legend that this movie has become.  Thank you Mr. Reeve.  In 1978, you not only convinced a 13 year old boy that a man could fly, but that by embracing what's good and right in this world, we all could soar.
B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam - Vs. (1993)<br /><br />Contrary to some reviewer's opinion at Blender magazine, I would rate this sophomore effort lower than their phenomenal debut \\"TEN.\\" For one thing, \\"VS\\" recycles some of the best ideas from that album, particularly the guitar style found on \\"Even Flow.\\" Still, the best songs represent a mature and confident step forward for the band that easily elevates my rating to 5 stars.<br /><br />\\"Go\\" - big and bombastic, this one is a true balls-to-the-wall rocker full of thrashing energy. ***1/4<br /><br />\\"Animal\\" - a scathing indictment against sexual predators. One of PJ's fiercest, best songs. *****<br /><br />\\"Daughter\\" - The lyrics initially confused me, but I eventually sorted them out in my head. A worthy classic. *****<br /><br />\\"Glorified G\\" - a slam against a certain misguided mentality among Americans concerning guns. Also a pretty cool song. ****<br /><br />\\"Dissident\\" - an unusual song, like \\"Daughter\\" this one really grew on me. I'm always amused at musical purists who complain about Stone Gossard's playing, how he doesn't adhere to a standard 1-4-5 chord progression or whatever. Get off it you snobby musicians! Rules are made to be broken. I wonder why Pearl Jam is so popular and beloved if they're so bad. *****<br /><br />\\"W.M.A.\\" - drums from a dark subterranean jungle and a bad-a** bass line bring home this harrowing protest against police brutality. A truly awesome cut. *****<br /><br />\\"Blood\\" - even more noisy and bombastic than \\"Go\\" and not as good a song either. ***<br /><br />\\"Rearviewmirror\\" - great rock n' roll, heavy on the roll. This one concerns personal emancipation and looking back in anger. *****<br /><br />\\"Rats\\" - a funky, quirky little groover. Also a fun, wigged-out rock song. While it describes the habits of rats, this song is actually a critique of people. *****<br /><br />\\"Elderly ...\\" (now known simply as \\"Small Town\\") - a gorgeous, melancholy lighter-waver and Pearl Jam classic. *****<br /><br />\\"Leash\\" - another wild thrasher, Vedder screaming. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Indifference\\" - one of their all-time greats.

0671027387|3.0|This was my first Dan Brown novel. Typically, I don't read much fiction, but on a recent plane ride I needed something a little easier to read than a textbook.<br /><br />This book is a political / technological / adventure story that takes place over the course of a single day. The plot is rich with twists, turns, and layers of detail. It reminds me of Red Storm Rising, though with significantly less depth and length.<br /><br />I found the plot to be a little predictable. I figured out, or had theories on, several of the plot twists well before they occurred. Dan Brown's foreshadowing is very obvious in this book, and I prefer it to be a little more sneaky. Further, I found the romantic subplot to be a little contrived.<br /><br />Many would argue that some of the encounters detailed in the book where simply not realistic. While I agree, I also recognize that this is a novel that is supposed to be entertaining. So as long as you're willing to overlook what could be described as fantastic luck on the part of the protagonists, you will get a kick out of their action-packed string of mishaps, discoveries, and impossible situations.<br /><br />Having said all of that, the book was an interesting read. It was tough to put down until I was finished with the story. If you can get past the shortcomings, it's a fun diversion.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I watched VAN HELSING not once, but twice ~ very unusal for this movie goer.  Hugh Jackman's charming heroics throughout the movie were enough to woo me to watch again.  The digital effects were exceptional.  Check out the bonus features that describe the making of the film.  Impressive!  Take for granted the cinematography that goes into movie making.
B00005JMUA|4.0|This is a great movie, don't get me wrong. It is extremely well made, and a whole lot better than most other movies of 2004. <br /> <br />However, Kill Bill Vol.1 is just better. The plot additions that Vol.2 brings are not great. Some plot twists are kind of lame, namely a romance that is revealed that makes the story kind of pathetic, simple, and very \\"Hollywood.\\" <br /> <br />It's good enough, but Tarantino has done better.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol is an acquired taste to say the least.  Their dark soundscapes require some getting used to but once the listener is able to appreciate the catchiness of the hooks they will only want more.  Turn On The Bright Lights is one of the most layered and intricate albums of the last decade or so and studying this album pays off.  \\"Obstacle 1\\" is without a doubt one of the most memorable songs of all time and the rest of the album follows suit.  Each song is a lead in to the next while being its own amazing seperate entity that craves attention and admiration.  Interpol has what so many bands lack and that is build up.  Interpol knows how to build a song to musical bliss and every track sports that trademark here.  Once the listener is able to pierce the dark droning of the album, they will be in for a real treat.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|Simply put, Madeleine Peyroux sounds a great deal like Billie Holiday. Perhaps she has elements of other great singers, but Billie's influence is most prominent. Having said that, I'm absolutely blown away by this cd. Peyrous stretches this time and does her own thing. The songs are well chosen and suitable for Peyroux's song stylings. This is soulful, jazzy, and blusey. Someone once said of Holiday \\"it ain't jazz, it ain't the blues....I don't know what it is, but you've got to hear it. My sentiments exactly.
B00008OLIC|1.0|But unlike the Chinese appetiser, this stuff stinks. And to think, it's actually an improvment over their earlier tunes. Such cheesy, weak musicians. Partying with them must've been far more fun than hearing their music. The most interesting thing about this album is noting the real-life kickstart to the heart one of these musicians got from an adrenalin shot right after an overdose of smack before going onstage (was it Nikki Sixx? Oh, who cares).<br /><br />The only one in this band with any real talent was the drummer.<br />ATTENTION TOMMY LEE: You've GOT to make another METHODS album! It's by far the coolest thing you've ever done. Get biddy wit' it!
1577311523|1.0|Plenty of other reviews here to point out the strengths of this almost trivial little book. The big problem I had was with the amount of ego Eckhart inflicts upon the reader. The stuff he's sharing is ancient wisdom, not \\"his.\\" If you want a guru who seems to enjoy basking in your admiration, you'll like this book. If, on the other hand, you appreciate the self-deprecating aspects of most \\"masters\\" this author will turn you off in Chapter One, if not earlier.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie was a good escape from reality by allowing one ot laugh until they forgot about whatever bothered them. I play this whenever I am down or depressed, it always lifts my spirits.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Simply enough, this is a great film. It is not Tarantino's best (Reservoir Dogs? Pulp Fiction?), though. It has strong editing, writing, and action, but the acting is somewhat forced on Thurman's part and I've been told her Japanese is horrible by a friend that is Japanese-born.     Despite that, (...) [it] is EXTREMELY entertaining and fun to watch. It is worth the rental fee or DVD purchase, for sure.
B000099T2L|5.0|Well as we all know this was Beyonce's first solo album and man was it great! Her first hit from the CD (Crazy in Love) was a infectious, awesome song that made you want to get up and dance every time you heard it! After that her next smash was Baby Boy, a sexy, urban, dance song that was a pleasure to hear. Then the slow, but sexy, Me, Myself, and I was out and made every person who heard it feel like singing. Then, she got her sexy, sensual, TRL retired hit, Naughty Girl, which in my opinion is the best song on the C.D.! With this CD, Beyonce proves that she truly is amazing! <br />1-Crazy In Love (9/10): awesome song but the rap brings it down a point <br />2-Naughty Girl (10/10): Insane! How can anyone have so much talent and use all of it in one song! THIS SONG IS AWESOME! You can't listen to this song without turning to stereo on full blast. <br />3-Baby Boy (10/10): Dance song that has an urban feel a regae (spelling?) touch <br />4-Hip Hop Star (9/10): A little too much rap but certanly a great song. Every word from her mouth is amazing! <br />5-Be With You (10/10): Best ballad of all time! If you are a sucker for a killer slow song that you can have in your head all day...this is it! Man this girl can sing! <br />6-Me, Myself, and I (10/10): A feel-good-about-yourself for all the ladies goin through a break up. Awesome song. <br />7-Yes (10/10): A great song! Addicting and singable. <br />8-Signs (5/10): The song has a great beat but is inturupted by the totally random, totally annoying yelling of \\"REWIND!\\" by Missy Elliot...maybe she should stay in her own songs and leave the signing to the pros. <br />9-Speechless (10/10): At first it seems like it drags on forever...but then after a few times listening to it you will love it! Great song. <br />10-Thats How You Like It (10/10): Suprsingly the rap in this song doesn't sound bad and makes the song sound very nice! One of the few songs that can pull off a rap/pop duet. <br />11-The Closer I Get To You (9/10): A little slow but definitly a great song. Great to sing along to. <br />12-Dangerously In Love 2 (10/10): Great song, sounds like the Destinys Child song but is done with a differnt tune! What a voice she has! <br />13-Beyonce Interlude (10/10): Just the sound of her voice is great.... <br />14-Gift From Virgo (10/10): Great Song....no more to say...just great. <br />15-Daddy (10/10):Great Song about her father's dedication and love. What a great kid... <br />So in the end the CD is...well, great. Don't belive me? Buy it! I promise you will not regret it! And if you are one of the people who deicide to say things that are oh-so wrong about Beyonce's Album then maybe you should go watch this years grammys again! 5 i belive ;) <br />Well, that's my review...ENJOY THIS CD!! <br /> <br />
B0001UL7RY|5.0|WOW!what a second album! I thought it was great. it was so amazing. It is very deep,emotional and more moving than her first album. She is definetly here to stay!pick up this album!!!it's sooooooooooooooooooooooo amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ROCK ON AVRIL!!!!1
B000002JSN|5.0|This is one of the absolute best Zeppelin albums and definitley one of the best rock albums ever. This along with IV are the two must have Zeppelin masterpieces. IV displayed Zeppelin as they migrated away from their bluesy roots and indulged in folk and celtic flavorings, Physical Graffiti shows them doing it all, from raw roots blues, to middle eastern hard rock, to simple folk ditties. Plant and Page shine as do the Bonham/Jones rythm section. The absolute best track on here is the exotic hard rock of \\"Kashmir\\"(which is about heroin or forgein lands depending on how you read the lyrics) which is one of the most excellent songs ever recorded. Double albums are commonly critisized for over indulgence and too much filler material but this is not the case in Graffiti which is only too good to be real!
B0000X61VE|4.0|This really is a great tape. Effective and fun and, both in it's time and now, refreshingly drastically different from anything else out there. It's true, some jerky movements could injure somebody who isn't used to exercise, and the movements are performed fast. But it seems to me fast things or things that use momentum, if done safely, just work the body a little differently, not ineffectively.  <br /> <br />The previous reviewer is right on the mark to compare exercise trends to diet trends. Those of us who have followed exercise commentator advice for decades can well imagine how today's trends would have been panned by experts in 1992. There were such exaggerated concerns about balance and people falling and hurting themselves during movements, I recall. Can you imagine the screeching from experts in the past if experts on every new show were telling beginners to do strenthg moves while wobbling on a balance disk or while leaning precariously back on a big ball?!  Suddenly it's ok, and recommended, with not a peep from anybody about the safety of it. The point being that just like with the diet end of things, the experts will always be changing their minds.
0783117523|3.0|Angelina Jolie is the only good thing about this movie. The writing is sub-par, the story is simple, and not to mention it's a TV movie, so not much money went in to making it interesting to watch.  <br /> <br />However, if you like Angelina Jolie, like I do, then you will like this movie. It showcases her body above her acting ability, but she still makes this movie 3 stars instead of 1.
B000084T18|1.0|Gangster rap, heavy metal and violent videogames are the reason why our children are violent and there are so much violence it todays schools. This cd features killing, violence, and it will turn your nice normal kid into a violent, gangster type kid, and its been proven by the MAVV.
B0000062GE|5.0|When I heard the song SAVE YOURSELF. I really liked it. I also heard lots of great things about this album and how it was SW greatist record. I enjoyed every song on the album. The song I liked the most was track #9 SOMETIMES IT HURT. Its very emotional and at the same time it has a industrial flow to it. Track 9 is the one song I never get tired of listing to. Also if you enjoyed this album I would also recommend UNGOD which is their first album.
B000003N7K|5.0|I have known about the voice of Johnny Hartman for years, but I have just discovered this CD.  Hartman's voice is simply beautiful.  Lush and smooth as velvet he carries each song in this CD to the best it could possibly be.  Coltrane is wonderful too.  Never overwhelming, Coltrane adds just enough to make this a very, very special CD.
B0002O7XWC|5.0|The extra music CD is a nice feature and brings back memories. The added documentary of making the film is the best feature. I truly enjoyed it though I wasn't a heavy pot smoker type in those days. I love bikes and the idea of riding across the country in the 60's was much more of an adventure than it is today. Believe me.<br /><br />The philosophical viewpoints being expressed by Hopper and Fonda are a close look into the basic feelings many young Americans had in those days. The conflict in one's mind of the idea of what freedom means to different people is excellent reference material for anybody analyzing where they stand on such matters. It was amazing Dennis and Peter didn't want to make judgment on the Viet Nam War by talking about it or showing scenes they could have included. See the CD to see what I mean. I believe that was good choice. College profs should make a lesson plan based on this movie. Us old guys remember the times like it was yesterday. New young whippersnapper college students will see this as ancient history.<br /><br />The best part of the documentary is the inclusion of real people along the way picked on the spur of the moment by Hopper. They give the film far and above what any actor could bring to the screen for authenticity. That's what makes this film a cult classic...a legend in the movie business if you will. Those real people are incredible. See it for yourself as they go over those scenes - shear brilliance on Hoppers part. Hopper is a brilliant actor too and he really gets your emotions bubbling.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The first \\"Matrix\\" should be the only one. The second two films are severly lacking in all the ways that make \\"The Matrix\\" great: Pioneering special effects, mind-blowing story, and innovation. This movie rides the coat-tails of the first one with little success.  <br /> <br />It failed to keep me interested, or awake for that matter. I watched it once on the big screen and once on the small screen, and I recommend seeing this in the movie theater for the special effects.  <br /> <br />Skip this one and get \\"The Matrix\\" instead. <br />
B00005JNEI|2.0|While the argument that this film's only aim is to achieve controversy is pursuasive, it is by no means conclusive. <br />Yes, it has necrophilia, incest, prostitution and intense violence, but to talk only about these things reduces the film to a petty little gratuitous teenage-angst rant. Or, as one reviewer has claimed, this is shock value without purpose, place, or reason is somewhat naive. <br /> <br />The film is a work of genius. Fantastic, visionary, apocalyptic. <br /> <br />Micheal Moore displays the carnivalesque workings of the body to the full. Where others have chosen to shy away, Moore explores every crevice of the grotesque, literally dissecting it to its corporeal elements to discover just exactly where are heads are at. The dead body is central to the film. Typical outdated stereotypes of the human mind, and indeed of America, are discarded along with the decaying flesh. Namely, preoccupations with politeness, taste, manners, and rational, institutional values are laughed at and abused. These things, along with sexual life, eating, drinking, and defecation have radically changed their meaning. <br /> <br />The film is made in a time where America and its people are questioning and trying to define themselves. The warm closed insular security of the American economic womb has been violently ruptured. Jobs and moral values are no longer stable in modern-day America. Just exactly does it mean to be American? A number of middle-eastern influences confuse the cultural collage that the USA in a time where not many things are stable. Boundaries that did exist are no longer there. Being polite, reserved and rational with a nice institution to support you is no longer America. <br /> <br />And this is where Moore comes in. Moore explores boundaries and then seeks to subvert them. Sexual boundaries do not exist. One is free to have sex with one's daughter or drink the breast-milk from your wife because there is no where to stop when there are no borders. Bypushing the boundaries and bringing them to the fore, Moore questions what exactly makes us tick. Where are we when there is no one to define us? We may have the trappings of civilized beings, but we are after all bestial.  <br /> <br />The home video camera work gives the film a haunting sense of reality and naturalness to what was previously considered to be unnatural. The dark sense of humour permeating through this real texture transcends this film from generic classification. It is a grotesque operatic romp mocking the polite film establishment, politics and society and repressive stereo types.  <br /> <br />It questions why we find such interest in watching these things, and most disturbingly, what should we feel when we watch them.
B000001ELR|2.0|Aside from the cover being my favorite KISS album cover EVER, Creatures of the Night is 1 of my least favorites from KISS. Don't get me wrong, the title track is a great opener and it definitely ROCKS! But the high points for me are \\"I Love it Loud\\" \\"I Still Love You\\" & my favorite from Creatures \\"Killer\\"     Even though I only give Creatures 2 stars, I still recommend it.
B000683VI4|2.0|I can't really give this more than two stars, for several reasons. For one thing it gratuituously tells us repeatedly that a romantic couple who are its subject didn't get along, not to mention that how their romance started in the first place is improbable and hokey to the hilt. It even throws in some disappointing scens of ugly fighting to prove its gratuitous point that the couple didn't get along. But the main reasons why this movie is overall disappointing relate to a central secret, concealed for a while. But the secret becomes all too obvious by at least halfway through the movie. Then the movie becomes overlong, ponderous, and sourly sentimental. <br />But the silver lining to this cloud is how the movie brilliantly showcases the stunning talents of Rachel McAdams. May she go on to exercise those talents fruitfully in many a movie, unlike all to many contemporary actresses! She puts herself so completely into her role herein as to resemble in no way her villainous but equally well-acted Regina George. How refreshingly versatile in an age when we have actresses like Ashley Judd, who seems to insist on always playing essentially the same obnoxious \\"ball-buster\\" in all her movies! I can't remember another case of a performer taking on such divergent roles as Rachel McAdams has in her last two movies, so as to challenge audiences to believe they are actually watching the same actress in both. I hope the movie-making world fittingly values her talents and does not let them be wasted. But that is iffy in a world and age where an actress such as Kirsten Dunst can go from a performance that should have won an Oscar in DROP DEAD GORGEOUS to being so gratuitously and egregiously de-flowered in THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and then to doing little else than fluff in anything since. May Rachel fare much better than that!
B0001XAPX8|4.0|Enough ideas for a dozen ordinary films, with some great sequences, and terrific acting from all concerned, I was engrossed from the beginning. No satisfactory artistic resolution as in a three act drama, but stimulating nonetheless.
0131177052|5.0|(Copy of a review found at [...]) <br /> <br />The Point <br /> <br />If you need to fix, maintain or extend code without tests, and you're trying to do it without having a copy of this book by your side, you might as well just jab yourself in the stomach with a knife. Michael Feathers does for legacy code what the Gang of Four did for design: establish a vocabulary to make it easier to understand and communicate about how to work with legacy code. <br /> <br />The Details <br /> <br />There are some books that we use as references when we teach courses or do some consulting. These are usually the fundamental texts that provide an appropriate foundation for the reader in a given topic area: Java programming, programmer testing, enterprise architecture, what have you. Even before the book had been released, we were recommending it in courses on Test-Driven Development. The reason is clear: true greenfield projects are few and far between. A team trying to adopt Test-Driven Development has enough to learn; we can't leave them to their devices to figure out what they're going to do starting Monday. \\"How do we deal with the 250,000 lines of untested code we still need to use?\\" A Master Programmer cannot leave a team like that hanging. <br /> <br />Enter Michael Feathers and his years of experience rescuing legacy codebases. He has distilled his secrets into a collection of fundamental techniques combined with a catalog of strategies and approaches. In many ways, WELC is like other \\"how to\\" books: it starts with setting the context for the techniques, describes them with examples, then adds a catalog of ways to break dependencies in the back. One of the things that differentiates this book is the chapter titles. They are whimsical and, as a result, effective. Some examples follow. <br /> <br />    * It Takes Forever to Make a Change <br />    * I Need to Make Many Changes in One Area <br />    * My Application Has No Structure <br />    * This Class Is Too Big and I Don't Want It to Get Any Bigger <br /> <br />We have struggled with maintaining existing code, and in the process have had many of the exact complaints that Michael has made into chapter titles. Each chapter is rich with useful examples in Java, C# and C++. You'd be surprised how many requests we get for courses teaching Test-Driven Development in C++, and they have plenty of legacy code to work around! Michael's conversational style gives you the feeling of having him along side while you work, and frankly, you can't get Michael for only USD 45 plus taxes, but the book is a bargain at twice the price. <br /> <br />Post Script <br /> <br />In order to add book reviews to this web site (masterprogrammer.info), we needed to add a feature to a small amount of legacy code in PHP. (We're still learning how to test-drive PHP-based web sites, so we've made the classic mistake of worrying about it later. See how easy it is?) We used techniques like Sprout Method to make safe changes to the code that generates our Self-Study bookshelf while adding the ability to link a book to our review. What more proof do you need? To purchase Michael's excellent book, go back to our Self-Study bookshelf and click on Working Effectively with Legacy Code.
0790731452|5.0|All about the passivist approach to national defense. A hillarious look at how wishful thinking can prevent people from confronting even the most obvious of enemies (think terrorists).<br /><br />It's a pretty off-the-wall flick, but my humor leans heavily toward the absurd and silly
B000009EOR|4.0|The song selection could've been a bit better. For example, \\"King of the Night Time World\\" \\"Strutter\\" & \\"Calling Dr. Love\\" should've replaced \\"Cold Gin\\" \\"Love Gun\\" & \\"Sure Know Something\\" but, oh' well. Killers is still worth having especially the Japanese version or better yet the Australian version which includes \\"Talk To Me\\" instead of \\"Escape from the Island\\"
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park is a great band. Not the best, but they're pretty good. This CD is consistant with their abilities, and once you start talking like a loser, and saying, \\"they're posers; linkin park is for pussies who can't listen to real metal\\" and just judge the songs, you'll realize they're not all that bad. <br /> <br />12 songs make up this CD, and for all of you who say they can't write don't know a thing about lyrics. <br /> <br />1. Foreword - this isn't a song; just an introduction that, if not played before the first song is nothing more than an audio clip. 10/10 <br />2. Don't Stay - this song is the closest Linkin Park will ever get to real metal. It's still a great song. 8/10 <br />3. Somewhere I Belong - this is a beautiful, dark song, but only at the chorus does it become rock 7/10 <br />4. Lying From You - this song's a cross between rap and metal, and about how we will often lie when we can't add up to what we're expected 9/10 <br />5. Hit the Floor - a good punk song about lies and the liers who tell them. 9/10 <br />6. Easier to Run - a really sad, angry song, of a wierd style, but probably one of if not the best song on this album. 10/10 <br />7. Faint - a fast pop rock song with a little screaming at the end. Not the best but still fun to listen to. 6/10 <br />8. Figure.09 - I'm still not sure what the title has to do with anything, but it's once again a cross between rap and metal. It's about someone who has given their life up to convenience others, and has forgotten themselves in the process. 7/10 <br />9. Breaking the Habit - a wierd quasi-rock song about being dependant on things. (most likely drugs) 8/10 <br />10. From the Inside - a straight up rock song, fueled with despair 8/10 <br />11. Nobody's Listening - if there's a dud on this CD, this song would be it. It's a failed attempt at rap, but a good chorus, nice instrumentals, and few nice lines save it. 5/10 <br />12. Session - a haunting intsrumental similar to Cure for the Itch (Hybrid Theory, 2000) that mixes Techno, Classical, and Rock to make a pretty, fast, and bizarre song. 10/10 <br />13. Numb - great song. The lyrics flow well, and the melody kicks. 10/10 <br /> <br />The only elements that got this CD 4 out of 5 stars was Nobody's Listening, and chester's occasionally annoying voices of Chester and Mike. They don't, however, ruin the CD at all. Overall this a great CD. Buy it.

B0000C0FJB|4.0|As a long-time Rush fan I couldn't help buying this new record from the canadian trio. Besides, I had just to get ready for the magnificent live happening in Milan and this was the best way. What can I say ? A very hard sound, a return to the original power of the first four albums, aligned with the new and increased musical soundness of the latest work, \\"Vapour Trails\\". <br />Why 4 stars?  Rush music and technic do not really deserve such high (and noisy) effects from the audience:there's a better way of mixing (see other masterpieces like \\"Exit Stage Left\\" or \\"A show of hands\\"). <br />For Rush maniacs a must; for newcomers a good way to taste what this band was able to do in 30 years and what they can actually do on stage.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Guided by respected critics of all musical genres, I have selectively purchased almost 1,000 CD's.  In my opinion, Stevie Wonder is the only artist who has consistently approached the ability of Mozart to channel Spirit into music.  Upon closer examination, the methodology underlying this majestic album becomes apparent.  In most of the tracks, Stevie Wonder has blended each of the four great root inventions of the twentieth century, into a unique mix of `total soul'.  He has uniquely combined the Gospel vocal melodies of Sam Cooke, the Blues bass runs of Muddy Waters, the Funky drum rhythms of James Brown and the Jazz keyboard / horn improvisations of Ray Charles and Louis Armstrong.  That is what makes this album the greatest single accomplishment in popular music of the past 50 years and why the history books will record Stevie Wonder as a virtuoso amongst the other musical giants. <br /> <br />Other songs which approach the level of the 15 best songs on Songs In The Key Of Life are: Golden Lady, Higher Ground, Jesus Children of America, All in Love is Fair, Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing, He's Misstra Know It All (from Innervisions), Superwoman (from Music Of My Mind), You Are The Sunshine Of My Life, Tuesday Heartbreak, Superstition, Blame It On The Sun (from Talking Book) and Smile Please, Heaven is 10 Zillion Light Years Away, It Ain't No Use, They Won't Go When I Go (from Fulfillingness' First Finale)... and there you have it: 30 songs of `total soul' perfection. <br /> <br />And a parting recommendation for the highest song of the past 50 years... 'Another Star'. <br />
B000001ELP|5.0|I don't care what anyone say's about The Elder, I love it. I don't have anything negative to say about it. My favorite tracks are:     Just A Boy, Odyssey, Only You, Dark Light & The Oath.     I give The Elder 5 stars.     You're NOT a true member of the KISS Army if it's not included in your KISS Catalog.
1400079179|1.0|This book is the definition of literary mediocrity.  It's probably not the worse book I've read, but it's certainly not good.<br /><br />But the publishers used some smart marketing to dress the book up in some more intellectual themes of art, religion, conspiracy and enigma.  I think that's why many readers are so disappointed.<br /><br />If this book hadn't sold so well, there would not be nearly as many controversial opinions floating around.<br /><br />I think most people -- myself included -- are really more angry at themselves for reading this really worthless book and at other readers for buying so many damned copies.  I honestly expected something quite more literary than the action-movie script that it actually was.  To me, this felt like a bait-and-switch.
B000050XEI|5.0|This CD is one my very favorites of hers. In my opinion, her greatest song on this album is \\"Wild Child.\\" This CD is perfect for ALL Enya fans. I can not wait until her next album comes out!
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|For some reason, I didn't expect great things from this movie, but \\"Gothika\\" was far, far better than I would have imagined and bodes extremely well for the future of Dark Castle.  Their remake of \\"The House On Haunted Hill\\" was okay, watchable certainly; \\"Thirteen Ghosts\\" was a slight step up but didn't quite fulfill its potential; then \\"Ghost Ship\\" went way up and was a really good movie, their first worth owning in my opinion.  \\"Gothika\\" is even better and I feel is the first Dark Castle production to attain true Greatness. <br /> <br />    Described as a movie about a doctor who suddenly finds herself instituionalized with a case of recent amnesia that's actually only the beginning of this unpredictable, imaginative spooker that's both truly disturbing and thrilling.  The performances are as impeccable as you'd expect from its accomplished cast, and every aspect of the production - the lighting, the special effects, the photography, everything - are first rate.  In my interpretation, there's alot under the surface that's never fully spelled out even in the end, and the potential for a sequel to reach even more diabolically horrifying heights.  Someone in a review or a message board or something somewhere opined that this movie and \\"Fear Dot Com\\" felt like they had an Asian influence to them, and I can't disagree.  If you're into \\"Gothika\\", you might want to consider giving some Asian horror greats like \\"The Eye\\" or \\"4 Inyong Shiktak\\" a try.  Regardless of geography, I'd enthusiastically endorse \\"Gothika\\" to fans of any style of horror movies whatsoever, or just anyone who likes tremendous ensemble casts in magnificently-made cinema, and can handle the substantial sinister elements.
B00004XONN|5.0|I'm not sure if this is my favorite radiohead album, but it is rocks. I'm not just writing this review for radiohead. If you like radiohead, you should check out Paul Lansky. He has been the cutting edge of computer music for a few decades and he awesome, capturing nostalgia and environment and the essence of everything he presents. In fact, radiohead sampled a piece from Paul Lansky for the song Idioteque. So, for sure, if you are a radiohead, please check out Paul Lansky.
6305922756|1.0|Okay, seriously, who the heck are these Spinal Tap fellas? I'm an expert on music (I studied the art form for four years, know every artist of the last 40 years, and scored an A+ on my math test...which really doesn't have anything to do with music, but it shows you that I am intellegent), and have never heard of these guys before. Let me ask you a perfectly reasonable question: why would you want to watch a documentary on a band that you've never heard of before? And to top it all off, the interviewer is some guy named Rob (who resembles a pig! That's right, a little piggy!). If I wanted to look at a hog for an hour, I'd make some bacon! <br /> <br />Also of note is that there's some character named 'Bobbi Fleckman'. How can you people be fooled so easily? Don't you realize that it's nothing but a cheap disguise? It's really The Nanny, Fran Fine! Nice try, Fran, but I didn't believe it for one second! I guess sometimes, you just have to get away from that butler and that old British guy! <br /> <br />People, whatever you do, don't buy this trash! Just wait until Limp Bizkit (the greatest band ever!) makes a documentary on their wild and crazy and cool antics! It's sure to put this to shame!
B00009V7T2|5.0|When I first listened to At The Drive-In's \\"Relationship Of Command\\", I hated it.  But after listening to it about five times, I was blown away.  The same thing happened with this album.  I bought it, unaware, thinking that this would be music similar to the late ATDI.  My lord I was wrong.  Do not buy this album thinkin that all the songs will be reasonable and poppy.  This album weaves a tangled web of confusion, and everytime I listen to it, I hear something new, and love it more and more.  The guitar riffs are amazing, lyrics compelling, and the fact that they recorded the entire album in a haunted house helps.  A remarkable album, one that should not be overlooked or underrated.
0425188809|5.0|An unbelievably good book that delivers all one could ask for and more from a horror novel, a suspense thriller, a romance, a tragedy, an inspirational drama, or a current-events-relevent 'cautionary' tale a la \\"Frankenstein\\" or \\"Jurassic Park\\".  \\"Watchers\\" is the story of two humans,Travis and Nora, who start the novel in states of metaphorical isolation from the world, and two other sentient beings, a genius-IQ'd golden retriever named Einstein and a 'brand-new-under-the-sun' creature totally outside of nature, The Outsider.  Travis and Nora, brought together by circumstance and Einstein, are instantly likeable and empathizable as is par for the course for many Koontz protagonists, the kind of people one might willingly trade a few blood relatives in to have in the family; Einstein is entertaining and fascinating and endearing, still the lovable, playful dog despite an intelligence on par with his namesake Albert; and The Outsider is terrifying and probably the most tragic nemesis in horror literature.  A host of supporting characters, good, evil, and somewhere in the middle, fit into the story perfectly, and the author creates a highly detailed feeling of 'being there' with clear but concise descriptions of everything relevant, from architecture to the weather to the meal of the day without ever once becoming obtrusive.  Impacts on almost every level a novel can hit, one of the greatest stories ever told.
B0002OERI0|5.0|...but I sure do learn about great music from American Idiot.  I'm not a music nut, and remember something about a band called Green Day a few years ago having a weird insane asylum video that got some play on MTV.  My friend said this was supposed to be the \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" of Green Day.  I thought he was crazy thinking Green Day could ever have something along the same lines as Sgt. Pepper's.  It is.  That is, every song is great, and there's a great range of style on the album as a whole.  This is a unique product.  I ended up downloading a few of the songs with Shareaza, but we vowed to see them in concert although I haven't been to any concert in over ten years, and I'll probably end up buying the CD anyway.  With this album, these guys seem like hard working professional song artists(like Paul McCartney or Billy Joel, except punk).  ...I've got to mention the great lyrics.  Usually I think that political lyrics make the music confusing, but these lyrics aren't preachy, and come to think of it, they aren't really political so much as social commentary on present day America.  Every song seems like a sincere spontaneous expression, and the lyrics actually add a lot to the music.  What makes this still true to punk roots and great song producing is that Green Day seems as frustrated as those they are playing to, and they broadcast their frustration with clean excellence in every way.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Some well deserved satire, not only of America's bombastic behavior, but also at some of our most self-righteous demagogues.  I don't think Mr. Moore is going to be amused by this taste of his own medicine.
0743454529|3.0|I have never read any of Jodi Picoult's books before but this one intrigued me so much that, as I approached the end, I was prepared to read more of her.  I was thoroughly captivated by the not-so-unreal issue of a daughter genetically engineered for the sole purpose of saving her sister's life from a rare form of leukemia.  Unbeknownst to the parents, however, the innocuous use of the baby's umbilical cord blood was not the beginning of two wonderful lives.  The new daughter, Anna, is used over and over again for the next 13 years to save her sister's life over and over again.  When she's not being a lifesaver, however, Anna feels invisible as a daughter.  Finally, when only a kidney will do the trick, not the easily given and replaceable blood, bone marrow, and blood products, Anna rebels and decides it's her body and she no longer wants to give it up.  She hires a lawyer and sues her parents for medical emancipation. <br /> <br />What follows is a wonderfully evocative story, told from the viewpoints of all the players, all very fascinating in their own rights.  I have a daughter who is an 11-year cancer survivor  so I know so much of this book rings very true.  I had to stop every few pages to think about the issues and how I might respond were I living THIS story,  not my daughter's whose treatment and outcome were so successful and required only anonymous blood and platelet donors.  My only complaint is with the characterization of the mother, Sara, which seems a bit one-dimensional.  Picoult does not show us the soul beneath Sara's obsession, everyone else be damned, to save her older daughter's life.  <br /> <br />But then, just as the reader is preparing for one of two or three possible, conceivable, endings, Picoult does something for which I cannot forgive her.  She throws in an ending for which no one can be prepared and for which no one SHOULD be prepared.  It was gratuitous, capricious, disjunctive, and entirely unnecessary.   It will be a long long time before I ever pick up another Jodi Picoult book.   <br />
0060512806|5.0|Cryptonomicon was my first foray into the world of Neal Stephenson, so I really wasn't sure what to expect.  I checked the book out from my library to read the first 100 pages and decide if it was worth owning or not.  About 75 pages into it, I was hooked.  I returned it to the library and dropped the $16 on my own copy.<br /><br />What does it do?  The question is more what doesn't it do.  Stephenson interweaves fiction and reality so seamlessly, that I found myself hopping onto the internet, nightly, looking up places named Qwghlm and Nazi submariners named Bischoff.<br /><br />Real-life historical characters such as Alan Turing, Douglas MacArthur and Karl Donitz are all pulled in as supporting characters, and you begin to question where the fiction ends and true situations begin.<br /><br />I've never really considered myself a true science-fiction geek, so I guess you could say this book has a bit of crossover appeal.  I loved the in-depth descriptions and word-play surrounded heavily in technology and cryptography.<br /><br />I will agree with some other reviews, that a few times, I found myself accusing Stephenson of rambling.  But it's worth it, and I'll tell you why.  For every instance of him rambling about non-coherent imaginative concepts, you get 3 times that many informative, off-the-cuff stories about subjects like Van Eck phreaking, Mythology, and submarine physics.  I found that I learned so much information by reading this book that I could readily compose a few bar wagers.<br /><br />All in all, I recommend this book to science-fiction heads, and casual fiction lovers alike.  You may just find that in this far-fetched \\"gold hunting tall-tale\\" that you've learned a thing or two about a thing or two.
0375422889|4.0|When you read that this sequel involves Marjane's return to Iran, you kind of just want to scream \\"Why?! Why, for all that is good, return to the place your family wanted you to escape?\\" The book, then, preceeds to help sort you out. <br /> <br />The European world, especially the nilist, drugged-out, counter-culture world, isn't all it's cracked up to be. And she misses her family. She wanted to go home. And when she leaves again (oh, come on, this isn't ruining the story, the dust jacket says she lives in France) she leaves happier than her last leaving. <br /> <br />The hardest thing to deal with is, I suppose, Marjane coming into her own personality. As a child, we were able to love her for her childishness and also see clearly everything from the hypocritacies of her self-proclaimed non-traditional parents to how she and her classmates treat other children. Now that she's an adult (or young adult) it's difficult to not see how her stubbornness makes her proverbially cut off her own nose (to the extent that she winds up homeless after a series of pride issues). We see her fall into the same hypocricasies of her parents. Little Marjane was fiesty and independent and we found it adorable. Older Marjane is stubborn and prideful and a lot more difficult to accept. <br /> <br />All that being said, the graphics are similarly powerful and the book leaves you thoughtful about the role of culture and society in the lives of the individual. It is still a very good book, and helps us to understand Marjane, understanding that Marjane is herself and not any projection of goodness and independence which we would want her to be. <br />
B0002KVUKM|4.0|\\"Van Helsing\\" hasn't got the best special effects in the world.  Sure, it has a ton of effects in it, but none of them are that special to watch.  In fact, many of them are pretty fake-looking.  But that only adds to the charm of this movie if you ask me.  This is supposed to be an homage to the monster movies of the past, and I think that \\"Van Helsing\\" manages to capture the essence of those flicks pretty well.  First of all, consider that the special effects in movies such as \\"Dracula\\" and \\"The Wolfman\\" were groundbreaking in their day, but are now looked at as sophomoric in effort when compared to the CGI-techno-plaster-anime-wingy-ding effects of today.  \\"Van Helsing\\" seems to be tipping it's hat at those old effects, all the while wrapping them into some modern CGI a la \\"The Mummy\\" with Brendan Fraser.<br /><br />The acting isn't earth-shattering, but it is fun to watch.  Hugh Jackman has this \\"John Wayne, tough guy with heart\\" thing going throughout this film.  Kate Beckinsale is a damsel-in-not-so-much-distress who manages to whip a little tail on her own.  David Wenham plays \\"Carl,\\" Van Helsing's sidekick monk, er, friar, who happens to be a whiz-bang inventor full of tricks and treats for our hero to use.  Frankenstein's Monster is given a light, but loving, treatment in this flick.  Mr. Hyde has a cameo(he looks quite a bit like Hyde in \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\").  The Wolfman makes a number of brief appearances, all of which are done in full-frontal CGI-glory.  The Brides of Dracula are rather pesky in this film, and garner most of Van Helsing's attention.  They keep him and the townspeople of Transylvania busy looking at the sky, just waiting for one of them to swoop down on a hapless citizen.  Dracula, as is with most of the old movies, takes center stage as the leader of the pack of villains.  He's played in a hokey fashion by Richard Roxburgh that hearkens back to Bela Lugosi's original, stiff presentation of the Prince of Darkness.  Roxburgh, as well as the rest of the cast, seemed to enjoy himself throughout the movie.<br /><br />Character development is almost non-existent, but if you are a fan of the creatures these films are based on, you really don't need much background information.

They got Julia Roberts the most overated actress on this planet to sell this movie. My God what a mediocre actress.  In this very boring movie she questions her students, 'is this art'.  The answer is NO Julia this movie is a insult to art and film making. Run for the hills men I'm still trying to recuperate.

B00005Y7NK|3.0|This album came out in 1989, right after what was probably the most turbulent period in Black Sabbath's long history.  It had even got to the point where \\"Kerrang!\\" had run a hoax story in the spring of 1988 saying that Tom Jones had joined Black Sabbath...I remember almost crying when I read that issue.  To this day, though, other than a couple of jokes from bassist Neil Murray and the late super-drummer Cozy Powell, I have never heard an official statement from Black Sabbath (specifically, Tony Iommi) about the Tom Jones fiasco! <br /> <br />However, in the summer of 1988, \\"Kerrang!\\" printed that Tony had recruited Cozy Powell (which was literally music to my ears as he is my favourite drummer and I always thought he would be perfect for Black Sabbath) and was making an album with Tony Martin, with a bassist to be named later.  <br /> <br />In the spring of 1989, \\"Headless Cross\\" was released.  I first heard an advance copy of it in my local record shop and thought how good it sounded.  Tony Martin did indeed continue to sound like a mix of Ronnie James Dio and David Coverdale, but he sounded much more confident, and Cozy Powell's drumming certainly didn't disappoint! <br /> <br />When I actually bought the album soon after, some disappointment started to set in.   It wasn't the music.  That was the finest that Sabbath had made in a long, long time.  It was still heavy Black Sabbath music, but more contemporary (I noticed that keyboardist Geoff Nicholls was a bit more prominent than before). <br /> <br />The disappointment was due to other factors. <br /> <br />First of all, this has about the cheesiest album cover ever to (dis)grace a Black Sabbath album, next to \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\".  Very cartoonish. <br /> <br />The biggest letdown was the lyrics.  It seems that on this album, Black Sabbath embrace the very thing they've been roundly criticised for over the years: the accusations of \\"Satanism\\".  On the previous The Eternal Idol album, Martin largely sang lyrics that had already been written.  Here, he writes the lyrics.  He does show a good grasp of the genre but it is so cliched.  There are very few songs that don't mention \\"Satan,\\" \\"the devil,\\" or \\"Lucifer\\" in one way or another.  I have often wondered why, when Martin is capable of so much more, and when Iommi has tirelessly denied the \\"satanic\\" connection over the years.  I suppose one has to look at the timing of the album's release.  In early 1989, bands like Slayer and King Diamond were getting very popular with satanic lyrical content, and Sabbath may have felt, \\"we did it first, let's show them how it's done.\\"  However, it just comes off as silliness and, as a Christian, this is something I just don't care for and it is the major letdown to an otherwise excellent album.  I have to wonder if it was Iommi himself that \\"guided\\" Martin in this direction or if it was their new record label, I.R.S.  I say this because Iommi has had a bad habit over the years of blaming missteps the band have made on \\"the record company\\" or \\"management\\".  I remember a Kerrang! interview around this time where Iommi said that Martin was a \\"brilliant storyteller\\" (he is) and that he was so knowledgeable about this subject because \\"he's really into the black arts...he studies it...\\" (later, Martin would say \\"don't worry, it's nothing that'll make you spontaneously combust!\\").  Having seen the band live with Martin, it doesn't fit his onstage persona at all. <br /> <br />That's my biggest problem with the album and one reason why it's one of my least-played Sabbath albums, even though the songs are indeed very good, for the most part. <br /> <br />\\"The Gates of Hell\\" - I don't really consider this a \\"song\\" as it's basically just Geoff Nicholls creating creepy synthesiser noises. <br /> <br />\\"Headless Cross\\" - This is almost a direct lift from \\"Heaven and Hell\\".  Even session bassist Laurence Cottle's bass line sounds like Geezer Butler's repeated triplets from \\"Heaven and Hell\\"!  As always, a fine guitar riff, and Powell makes his presence known right away!  Apparently this is about a plague that ravaged an English town called \\"Headless Cross\\" during the Middle Ages, but the lyrics (and accompanying video) are just creepshow dreck.  Trivia fans note: I looked on a pre-World War II era map of Great Britain and I did find a town called Headless Cross, south of Birmingham! <br /> <br />\\"Devil & Daughter\\" - More cliched pseudo-Satanism in the lyrics.  I didn't know the devil had a daughter!  It is a good song, though, more up-tempo. <br /> <br />\\"When Death Calls\\" - The album's \\"epic\\".  Back in the days of albums, Sabbath traditionally ended \\"side one\\" with an \\"epic\\" and that's where this fits in.  Despite yet more Prince of Darkness clichs, this is truly a creepy song.  Iommi's old buddy Brian May of Queen adds an excellent guitar solo, though it does sound like Iommi (maybe Brian was paying tribute to his friend).  Cottle's fretless bass harmonics are a very good intro. <br /> <br />\\"Kill In The Spirit World\\" - More creature feature lyrics but a good piece of melodic heavy metal. <br /> <br />\\"Call Of The Wild\\" - This was to have originally been titled \\"Hero\\" but was scrapped since Ozzy Osbourne's competing \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\" album had a song of the same title.  Powell's rousing drumming kicks off probably the most \\"commercial\\" song on the album.  Is that a sitar I hear or just Nicholls trying to sound like one?  Lyrically this is about a \\"hero\\" fighting the forces of darkness, so at last we get to hear something from the \\"other side!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Black Moon\\" - Apparently this was left over from \\"The Eternal Idol\\".  I wonder if the original's lyrics were as \\"satanic\\" as what's on offer here.  It's a good song, kind of boogie-flavoured but again the lyrics let it down.  I'd like to hear the original. <br /> <br />\\"Nightwing\\" - My favourite track on the album.  It begins with excellent Iommi acoustic guitar and builds into a very good song.It is indeed about owls and bats, as Martin said in an interview in \\"Metal Forces\\".  However, it does still have just a bit too much of a pseudo-satanic flavour for me.  Very, very good guitar work and Martin really shows what he's capable of vocally, if not lyrically. <br /> <br />This may sound like a negative review, and in some ways it is, but it's because as a long-time fan of this band I know that they are capable of so much more.  Tony Martin was probably the best singer for the band besides Dio but it's a shame he somehow felt he had to fit some sort of mould to be the singer in Black Sabbath, rather than just being himself. <br /> <br />Neil Murray, extraordinaire ex-Whitesnake/Gary Moore bassist joined for the tour - a very good choice. <br /> <br />This album and tour received rave reviews in the UK and Europe but in the States it was just typically \\"oh, Ozzy's not on it, it's not Black Sabbath\\" and the album went to hell with a bullet.  There were some tour dates Stateside but the record label didn't support them well and hardly anyone knew Black Sabbath was on tour. <br /> <br />If you're already familiar with the Tony Martin era, get this album, as it is very good quality musically.  However, if you're a neophyte to either Martin or Sabbath in general, it'll just give you the wrong idea. <br /> <br />I'd love to give this five stars but the lyrics are just so bad it takes two stars away for me.

B000092T6M|3.0|The movie itself is great for the most part. It's been a favorite of mine since 1991 when it was released. However, this new \\"Special Edition\\" DVD treatment was a big disappointment. My biggest problem was with the 12 minutes of added footage. Among the new added scenes are ones where the sheriff cuts out the tongue of his scribe and which show the now mute scribe writing all of his communications since he can no longer speak. However this 'special edition' then leaves in an original scene at the film's end where the scribe verbally tells Robin and Azeem where to find the sheriff (!) And even more frustrating is than NONE of the six commentators on the two commentary tracks bother to mention this.  It's so sloppy and inconsistent, I wish they had just left the film alone. If the filmmakers want audiences to see extra footage, but that footage is no longer consistent with the movie, they should put it in a \\"Deleted Scenes\\" section. Not incorporate it back into the movie. And the fact that director Kevin Reynolds says nothing about this flaw shows just how little he cared about his film. And as for the commentaries, there are HUGE gaps where nothing is said at all (in fact, at a few points, I thought my commentary track wasn't working it was so bad) and when they DO speak it's to say such pearls of wisdom as \\"Nice shot\\" \\"I still have that sword\\" and \\"Whoa\\" between the long gaps of silence. The movie deserved better.

1400034779|1.0|Referring to this book, and the entire series by the same author, I was very disappointed. On the one hand, these books are a refreshing change from the barrage of bestsellers pumped out from modern publishing houses in London and New York. You know the ones we all treasure as our 'guilty pleasures.' They are promoted, postered, and sold in airports and in the chain stores of the High Streets and shopping malls of both sides of the Atlantic. We do love to read them on the morning train and at the beach-`ever more lurid' with their serial killers, roman-a-clef political and entertainment celebrities, packed with murder, death, debauchery, conspiracies and mayhem. <br />     On the other hand, however, Smith's `Number 1 Ladies Detective Agency' series is pretty dull. Is this a question of `the emperor's new clothes'? It appears to be a sunny, pleasant recounting of basically decent and wholesome `ordinary' folks. Taking joy in the simple, daily pleasures kind of thing. But as one reads, one's teeth and pancreas start to ache from all the saccharin. His narrative voice simpers. The repetitive rhythm produces a monotone of banality. The characterizations and (forgive the use of the term, the `action') resembles more the baby talk of a remarkably earnest 10 year-old with special needs, than the voice of poetry and `simpler times' the author strives for. Hardly worth the eyeball time and minimal brain power required to process this drivel. <br />     These books ostensibly convey the charm and grace of a simpler, more natural, and therefore a somehow `more worthy than corrupt modern us' culture. That is certainly their avowed purpose, and is what at least some literary critics say about the series. That kind of `PC' and `diversity sensitive' western thinking is claptrap. Third world, or other so-called `native' cultural members don't simper, and don't use baby talk as a primary language when communicating within their own language speaking group. It may only appear that way at times when language differences limit and constrain what can be said and heard between such language speakers and native English speakers. Surely an educated person, and one who is supposed to have lived among village Africans for many years, would be aware of that? And would be sensitive to the per force inaccurate depictions of third world cultures that result from depicting such persons solely on the basis of the awkward and frustrating intercultural linguistic difficulties? <br />     Perhaps the puerile and monotonous style of these books might still be able to lay some claim as accurate portrayal of African life, that is, if the writer had to record his thoughts on a slab of clay (or some such rudimentary medium), painstakingly etched out with a sharp stick. In such a circumstance, the writer would be forgiven for abbreviating and omitting much of what would otherwise be required for a full and accurate version of daily societal interaction. But such a belabored, stereotyped, and simpering version from someone with access to a word processor, a typewriter, or even a pencil and proper paper is insulting and unforgivable. The stereotyping is subtle, as the intentions are probably inocuous, but the harm to the good people of Africa (and I have met many) will nonetheless further our misunderstandings of them. <br />

0393057658|3.0|I think this book book caught on to the hype of the state of baseball a few years back when the baseball commissioner proclaimed that small budget teams cannot compete. Then came the Oakland A's and proved that they could achieve success with clever management.  <br />This book provide insight into how the Oakland A's and particularly the human hero Billy Beane was able to find players cleverly based on stats.  <br />But this book made managing a baseball team like an online fantasy league as it is led to believe that a GM could basically evaluate players purely on stats and math. It dismissed the traditional ways of evaluating players based on their physicalilty as unworthy.  <br />I hope that there's another book or an updated version of this book to come out later on pointing out the weaknesses of the moneyball approach as this is not the only way to win on a small budget. There is a reason why the Oakland A's have not been able to get out of the first round of the playoffs. While there are other small budget teams such as the Florida Marlins that have won the world series with, gulp, bunting and stealing bases (areas that are dismissed by the moneyball approach) and scouting players based on their physicality, not just numbers.
068987474X|5.0|I really have felt badly for women thoughout the years who fall for men who just use them and don't have the ability to see their relationship for what it is.  Quite often these very same type of women dump on single women like me which is why I'm not very interested in the subject.  I've learned that many times it's not the man's fault--their brains are just different (See &quot;Men are from Mars&quot; book if you haven't already), so, this said, there are shades of gray in everything. That is where this book comes in--it tells it straight up with no frills.  Oh, it's funny in places, but more so, it's got what you need to hear.  <br />This was one of three books that our club recently picked to read.  The other two were Roth's &quot;Plot Against America&quot; and &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood.&quot; Are were excellent, but we felt we had to read &quot;He's Just Not That Into You&quot; first.  We weren't disappointed.
B0001I55OC|2.0|Let's face it; some movies were just made to be watched on TV for free, and Timeline is one of them.  If I had been sitting at home alone on a rainy day and this came on, I would have watched it and wouldn't have felt too bad.  But instead I paid $4 to rent it and wish I had about 3 of my dollars back.  This was a plain and simple action flick disguised as something deeper, which it wasn't.  The story had potential, but too many important parts were glossed over while character development and plot development were both passed over in favor of fight scenes and more fight scenes.  For a supposed \\"historical epic,\\" this one was about as shallow as they get.  You'll feel like you're watching a bunch of college kids running around in costume at the Rennaisance Fair.
0425170349|2.0|As a longtime fan of Clancy's earlier work (Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Sum of all Fears, etc.) I found myself <br />greatly disappointed by this novel.  An earlier reviewer noted that with the fall of the Soviet Union Clancy has been searching for a true villain.  While the action throughout this book was fun and exciting...I had a hard time swallowing the plot.  To think that extreme left-wing doctors and biochemists would plot the demise of the human race is absurd.  With all that is going on in the world today, surely he could have found a more realistic terrorist plot to write about.   <br /> <br />Normally, Clancy is meticulous in his research.  However I found his descriptions of the terrorist tree-huggers to be far from my experiences with people concerned about the environment.  Come on...environmentalists don't drive hummers and vegans don't eat eggs!  I never thought I would ask Tom Clancy to \\"Do more research!\\"   <br /> <br />The finally at the end was the last straw...I found myself reading it only because I had read the previous 850 pages.  Not only were the antagonists' actions unbelievable, but they were simply out of character.  To have a former FBI employee (Hendrikson) tell the group of untrained tree-huggers to make a stand against an elite fighting force that had proven its expertise, was simply ridiculous.  And the final ending, the ultimate punishment for the terrorists, was like a scene from a bad hollywood movie. <br /> <br />Sorry for the rip on this normally great author...but I really expect more from a Clancy novel.

B0002KVUL6|3.0|When I learned there was a 4-movie Ultimate Edition (containing Van Helsing PLUS the original films: Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolfman) I was more than eager to shell out extra bucks for the attractive, three-disc set. I figured Van Helsing may not be a cinematic classic but that it would at least be a fun romp, a \\"re-imagining\\" that riffs on favorite movie monsters. Like Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes re-imagining, once you suspend the notion that the original is sacrosanct, you are free to enjoy a new twist on favorite old characters. Both Van Helsing and the new Apes have their flaws to be sure, but they have good points that may be enjoyed if you are willing to gag the critic inside.<br /><br />And Van Helsing does have it's flaws. The plot is sometimes hard to follow, which is ironic, considering it is as thin as the air in Dracula's castle. The only thing truly developed about the characters is the extensive use of CGI animation. [The pervasive use of CGI will disappoint those who are hip to the look of it, as it comes off as cartoonish, despite the attempts at realism. Van Helsing violates the principle that just because you CAN do something, doesn't mean you should - the overruse of CGI prevents us from accepting many of the elements as real because the physics are never quite right, and so our minds know we're looking at something false.] What Van Helsing lacks in true drama, it seeks to make up for in thrills. In the end, it is a fun home theatre experience that yields some visceral thrills - you might think of the whole exercise as \\"Monsters: The Thrill Ride,\\" where Fun is the priority, not meaningful filmmaking.<br /><br />I give the movie itself 2.5 stars, plus an extra .5 star for the attractive packaging of Van Helsing: Ultimate Edition, and especially the SMART, VALUE-ADDED IDEA of throwing in the original three films!<br /><br />---<br /><br />UPDATE: While Sommers attempted to pay homage to the Universal monsters, the overwrought technology really severed much of that connection (it didn't feel grounded in the real world, taking us \\"out\\" of the movie). A better attempt to remake these monsters in the Universal tradition is 2009's The Wolfman, directed by Joe Johnston. Rather than pursue the CGI route with wild abandon (as Sommers did), Johnston relied mainly on atmosphere and practical effects - the wolfman was a make-up effect applied to its actors by make-up legend, Rick Baker. CGI was used to good effect for the transformation sequence only. This restraint grounds us in the real world. The wolfman looks real and dangerous (not like a sophisticated cartoon jumping about unnaturally as in Van Helsing). The story is more substantial in The Wolfman, and the characterization is better. The fundamentals really matter when you're asking an audience to suspend disbelief - I hope this trend continues if Universal tackles other classic monsters.t didn't feel grounded in the real world, taking us \\"out\\" of the movie).

B000000W9Z|5.0|Many hailed Earthling as Bowie's 'return to form', but I say go back one year to Outside and you've got a real masterpiece. Earthling had a couple of good tracks but this one'll really blow you away from start to finish. <br /> <br />Some might be put off by the album's opener which is a free psychedelic experimental thing (it is great, all the same) but it's not long before you're into the wonderful 'Outside' and 'The Heart's Filthy Lesson'. The sound being explored is similar to what he's done since (a sort of drum'n'bass/industrial vibe but still with Bowie's great lyricism and harmonic sense) but on this album I think the melodies are just that little bit more angular, perhaps more Bowie and less what everyone else is doing at the time. <br /> <br />For me the standout track is 'I'm Deranged', which was also part of the soundtrack for David Lynch's Lost Highway. The intricate layers of sound, and the melodies floating over the top are just beautiful - it rivals 'Ashes To Ashes' as my favourite Bowie track. <br /> <br />One noteworthy feature of Outside (particularly 'The Heart's Filthy Lesson' and 'I'm Deranged') is the amazing piano work of Mike Garson. His playing ranges from simple and tuneful to mind-boggling deranged freakouts.  <br /> <br />A point was made in another review about Bowie's lyrics being rubbish. Well this may be true - I remember seeing in a documentary once that he sometimes writes lyrics by picking words out of a hat! Regardless I still love the lyrics on this album, even if it's more for sound than meaning. <br /> <br />Overall a brilliant piece of work.
B00005QENZ|5.0|I'm not a big aerosmith fan really but being a teenager in the early 90's I couldn't help but notice the great songs off of this album as they were played on Mtv constantly. You remember right  .. those videos with Alicia Silverstone and Steven Tylers daughter? Whom he probaby bangs.  <br /> <br />In fact, the four hits from this album, Livin On the Edge, Cryin, Crazy, and Amazing, are the only songs I like from the entire album. The simple reason for this, is that Aerosmith writes Crap.  <br /> <br />The only other good songs they EVER wrote are Sweet Emotion, The Other Side, and Pink. That's it. Besides that, they just wrote a bunch of homo-erotic rock for wankers that like poodle hair cuts and air guitar solos.  <br /> <br />So my point being, this is the Aerosmith Album that is least bad. Four great songs. Nothing more, nothing less.  <br /> <br />At this point you probably can't help yourself from purchasing this album. Go ahead. Remember if you burn the cd directly to a copy cd-r when you first purchase it, then you can use the real disc for a coffee mug coaster or something so all your friends won't make fun of you TOO much for liking those 4 songs.  <br /> <br />

B00003CXIP|5.0|Its funny,sad,and inspiring.Watching all four of them will convince you that they're truly are friends in real life.Sure there's a lot of swear words but a movies this good,who cares?
B0001RVTXO|5.0|BUT I agree with some other reviewers in that if you are new to the Pixies, just go out a buy Doolittle.  Once you listen to that you'll want to own everything anyway.  Simpley one of the best rock bands ever.

B00004XONN|3.0|Sometimes I think a band trys to hard to get away from what they do best.  This is that kind of album.  I like it but I don't think it holds a candle to OK Computer, Pablo Honey, or even Hail to the Thief.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|ok, if you are that big of a matrix fan wouldnt you have already got all the movies? why buy this? its all the movies plus a lot of xtra stuff hardly anyone watches anyway. whats the point? i am a matrix fan, but own all the movies and frankly dont care how they made the movies. buy it if you dont have all the movies because it is a pretty good price. <br /> <br /> <br />oh yeah revolutions was a bug let down
B00005JMAH|4.0|I started out being a little disappointed with the film, but as I sat through it with my daughter (who is 25), who had never read this book in the series, I could tell by her reactions that she was not only enthralled, but well able to keep up with the important points of the story. The dementors actually affected her very appropriately, and we're talking about a serious horror genre junkie, here.  <br />I loved the new set, and having lived in England at one time, found the darkness, the heaviness of stone, and the dreary light very suitable and realistic.  I also found the landscapes and village scenes wonderful as well. <br />Considering the length and complexity of this book, I thought the director did a good job of pressing in the important highlights while still keeping it under 4 hours.  That should be more incentive for the disgruntled to go back and read the book again for sheer enjoyment of the story.
B000065PUE|5.0|This whole album is something no one should miss out on, everyone should have it, including people who for some reason, shun the Pixies because of some of their erratic and crazy guitar play and singing. This is what makes the Pixies so genius, they can have all of that raw energy and still make some really badass and rhythmic songs. If you ask me, they are some of the best song writers out there (and there are a lot) making awesome, sometimes random lyrics to go with their inventive music. If you ever get the slightest chance to see them live, take it, because the experince is multiplied when you have that same raw energy right in front of you, screaming at the top of its lungs
B000063DFN|5.0|Another totally awesome album from Iron Maiden.  The high points to this album come at the beginning and at the end.  To start, we get perhaps Iron Maiden's best into in Aces High.  That's immediately followed up by the unbelievably great 2 Minutes to Midnight (my favorite Maiden song of all-time).  The next song, Losfer Words, is actually a great instumental.  After that are Flash of the Blade and The Duellists.  Both very strong in my opinion as well (and seem to be somewhat related to each other).  Next is Back in the Village, whcih I think is the low point of the album.  After that, Bruce and crew come back with the very good title track and then the wonderful epic, Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  At over 13 minutes long, many Maiden fans believe this to be their best closer (which I have to agree).  If you are new to Iron Maiden, I'd pick this album up immediately along with The Number of the Beast and Somewhere In Time.
B00005JN7O|4.0|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this visual feast of a film. The timeframe is 1939-1940 - we know this because we see Polly Parker (Gwenyth Paltrow) viewing \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" on the big screen at Radio City Music Hall. She is a sassy professional journalist and amateur photographer in a mostly male-dominated workforce... but it's war time and no one is arguing.<br /><br />The film has almost a dream-like quality of old silver-gum prints that have then been hand-colored. You must see it to appreciate it. Every frame is like the saucy 1940 serials with Art Deco robots and technology.<br /><br />The robots look like Metropolis meets Gort - very artsy-fartsy, yet very ominous at the same time. These are giant 15-story-tall robots, some can fly, and they attack the city, tearing up buildings and streets, leaving with steel and generators, leaving the war-torn nations of the world without materials. No one knows who is behind this until they call Sky Captain (Jude Law) who has his own incredible James Bond-esque plane that can swim under water as well as fly. He and Polly end up trotting across the world, searching for the source of the robots. This same enigma is obviously also behind the disappearance of several of the world's most renowned scientists and no one knows if it's the Russians, the Germans, the Japanese or just some nut that's behind it.<br /><br />Thanks to two lewd comments and constant referral to a supposed incident of cheating on the Sky Captain's part when he was once dating Polly, the innocent, time-capsule quality of the film is lost. If just these few little scenes were snipped (all adding up to about 45 seconds), the film would be a timeless classic. I don't want to give up the plot of the film, but it's an interesting sci-fi genre from the time in which it emulates.<br /><br />This film is an epic achievement on a grand scale and a feast for the eyes and the nostalgic. I highly recommend it.
B000002VMH|5.0|While this CD is not the typical eurythmics fare, it is a showcase for a person, male or female, with a powerful instrument that is Annie's voice. While in some selections there is the richness of multiple layers, comparing it to fine cuisine depth of tasting would not be amiss, in other selections there is basically just her rich voice showing a depth of soul. A complete rounded presentation that is lacking in most of the current music offerings, this should be essential listening to one who is looking for a more complex experience.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I think writing so negative reviews about this movie is overdone and non appropriate only purely and simply considering the amazing amount of work done to produce these amazing 980 cgi effects.This deserves respect. <br /> <br /> The movie in itself belongs to the category of real unrealistic adventures movie let's say like \\"tomb raider\\"  and you like the style or not but the show is garanteed every single seconds for over 2 hours of real entertainment. <br /> <br />For the fun Van helsing gave me for over 2 hours i give 5 stars without any hesitation
0804106304|4.0|i enjoyed this book because it was very interesting, and i could relate to this book myself. I thought it was cool how an-mei discovered all these secrets about her mother while she was in the joy luck club. It was interesting what an-meis mom had to go through her life time, especially how she left her twin daughters just laying on the side of the road like that. I think that i really liked this book because it really reminds me of my grandma, an-meis mother is similar to my grandma. Overal i really liked this book.
B00030590I|5.0|This film far exceeded my expectations. It is very deep on many levels. The astounding cinematography which uses beautiful displayes of colors for emotional content, hevenly scenery, and exquisite choreographed fighting. The fable like story telling which Poetically layers truth and reality, questions friendship, duty, and honor, and provides a glimps into chinese history. The blend of all of these elements makes the flim enjoyable on many levels.<br /><br />  Beware spoilers in this paragraph. Some scenes I particularly enjoied where the battle with Sky in the \\"chess house\\" where they were playing \\"Go\\" which is a poetic foreshadowing of the battle that takes place in Nameless and Sky's mind. The fight in the leaves where the opponents rarely touch they just use there energy to force the leaves at each other. And the water confrontation.<br /><br />  Now I just want to get something off my chest. I feel that the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino Presents tacked on to this film, and broadcast in all of the promotion is just blatant shameless advertising. I don't think it gives the creators there due respect by having Tarantino's name thrown out there like he had anything to do with the film being made. I love his films, but this is absurd. I've had several people come up and say \\"Hey have you seen the new Tarantino movie?\\" The same thing happended with The Iron Monkey. I think it is disrespecful to the creators.<br /><br />  This is a classic epic film that I will soon add to my collection, and treasure for may reasons. I can't recomend it enough for those who are seeking a film experience which offers significant beauty and depth.
0805076476|5.0|I am basing this entirely on the movie.... IT was a modern marvel no special effects just a bare bones painful laugh of a movie. Chuck Palahniuk is a new favorite. He gets you envolved with the characters emotionally. there is not one person in the world that can't say that they wouldn't love to be able to beat the daylights out of a co-worker or just someone they saw walking on the street. this movie brings a whole new meaning the the word \\"life\\". I hope the book is half as good as the movie. If you want a good thrill and a different look on life just watch the movie or read the book...... I highly recomend it
B00008PC2O|5.0|I found the image and sound quality to be quite breathtaking on this DVD.  In my opinion the quality of the restoration and transfer even in regular (non-HD) mode easily surpasses the T2 ultimate edition.  Too me it looks just as good as a Superbit DVD if not better!    Buy this DVD for the stunning quality and the Ultimate edition for the features, (although I believe this one has the better commentary). Director Cameron's scientific/technical grasp is quite apparent throughout the commentary and I enjoyed his sense of humour.    My only gripe is the fact that the HD DVD-ROM mode is of the theatrical version and not the director's cut, other than that I would say this DVD is faultless and worth every cent.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird <br />Harper Lee <br /> Scout remembered her father saying, \\"You never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.\\"  At the end of the novel she says, \\"Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.\\" To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic novel about growing up and the loss of childhood innocence.  One of the major themes of the novel revolves around the meaning of courage.  Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch is growing up in the 1930's in a small Alabama town.  Her single father, Atticus, is a well-respected attorney.  Readers are taken through a period of three years in the lives of the children and their neighbors. A fire, a rabid dog and stories of Boo Radley fill the otherwise slow days of Scout, Jem and their friend, Dill.   The children are focused mostly on Boo and trying to catch a glimpse of him. Atticus is annoyed with their fascination with Boo, but finds himself in the middle of a rape trial which will challenge the soul of the town.  Tom Robinson, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. As the children watch their father take a stand, they learn lessons which can only be taught by example. This is a powerful story of growing up.  It is easy to be drawn into the book as it explores the message of true courage and standing up for what you believe. I recommend this book to all. <br />BIBLIO: October 11, 1998, Warner Books; Reissue edition, Middle-High School, $ 6.99 <br />REVIEWER: Katie Gordon <br />FORMAT: Novel <br />ISBN: 0446310786 <br />
B00001ZULV|3.0|Personally, I think that's a little incomplete compilation. To make a good Genesis compilation, you need a double pack CD.<br /><br />If I was made an ultimate Genesis compilation, it would be like that:<br /><br />Disc 01 - Peter Gabriel/Phil Collins-Steve Hacket/Anthony Philips era<br /><br />01 - Silent Sun<br /><br />02 - That's Me<br /><br />03 - The Knife<br /><br />04 - The Musical Box<br /><br />05 - Supper's Ready<br /><br />06 - Dancing With The Moonlight Knight<br /><br />07 - The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway<br /><br />08 - The Carpet Crawlers 1999<br /><br />09 - Dance On A Volcano<br /><br />10 - Your Own Special Way<br /><br />  Total time: 1h 17min. 57sec.<br /><br />Disc 02 - Phil Collins/Ray Wilson trio era<br /><br />01 - Snowbound<br /><br />02 - Follow You, Follow Me<br /><br />03 - Misunderstanding<br /><br />04 - Turn It On Again<br /><br />05 - Abacab<br /><br />06 - Mama<br /><br />07 - That's All<br /><br />08 - Invisible Touch<br /><br />09 - Land Of Confusion<br /><br />10 - In Too Deep<br /><br />11 - Throwing It All Away<br /><br />12 - No Son Of Mine<br /><br />13 - Jesus He Knows Me<br /><br />14 - I Can't Dance<br /><br />15 - Hold On My Heart<br /><br />16 - Congo<br /><br />17 - Not About Us<br /><br />  Total time: 1h. 18min. 53sec.<br /><br />The first CD would be a look in early Genesis, not exactly a \\"hits\\" CD, also including the new version of The Carpet Crawlers, and the second one would present the 80's and 90's Genesis, so, it would seems more like a hits CD. Ah, and with no edited tracks! Well, that's it. I think it would be agreeable between every Genesis fans to have a compilation like this, or next to this.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore should join the Army and go to jump school, like i did. Then perhaps he could talk junk about the Army. He makes it look like the Army is 100% black. At the hospital all the guys missing limbs are white. Any Army trooper who was not disgruntled was made to look like a fool who deserved to die. My old lady made me check this flick out, now its time for FahrenHYPE 9-11.
0140177396|5.0|In just over 100 pages, John Steinbeck gives readers a story rich in characterization and deep in meaning. Of Mice and Men chronicals the experience of two drifting farm hands struggling to survive during the Great Depression of the 1930's. Lenny and George dream of owning their own farm, but George, a sweet, simpleminded giant, inadvertantly keeps them from recognizing their dream.  <br /> <br />Steinbeck gives us a picture of the life of the poor during this difficult era and comments on friendship, racism, labor conditions, and the role of the mentally ill in 1930's society. The story is written is a simple, accessible style, but close reading reveals the story's multiple levels of meaning and strong detail. The characters act realistically and seem like they could be people you know. Although issues have changed since the Great Depression, the ideas Steinbeck presents remain relevant and meaningful even today. (Perhaps that's why this book is a classic? Ha. :) ) <br /> <br />Of Mice and Men is a moving account of two men who do what they can to get by. Steinbeck manages to capture the tragedy of the Depression, and the book's tones reflect this. Though not a book to read when you are already depressed, the novel is perfect for a relaxing winter evening in front of the fireplace and easy to finish in a single sitting.  A person could ponder the ideas presented long after finishing the story. I highly recommend this book.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If a picture tells a thousand words, imagine what a 120-minute of politically-fueled documentary featuring never-before-seen 'war on terror' footage and Bush's oligarchic-life's scenes would say.    From the disenfranchisement of African American voters in Florida to Saudi-Bush shady business connections, to 'winning hearts and mind' myths in Iraq and tough-on-terror fallacies of the Bush's presidency, Michael Moore takes you for a ride in a forbidden territory the corporate media so far hadn't dared to step in.    Moore takes you back to 2000, the year George W. Bush became president in the most disputed, criticized elections in U.S. history. It was the elections where the Supreme Court, the governor of Florida, and the U.S. Senate cast the conclusive vote.     'Farenheit' not only has succeeded in keeping the debate heated over the past elections; the film also will have you wonder about one of the most upheld premises most Americans have taken for granted since kindergarden: \\"The United States supports freedom in the World.\\"  The Saudi-U.S., or to be more specific, the Saudi-Bush relationship is a perfect example to attest the opposite. Here you have a monarchy made up of almost 5,000 princes, who along with their local associates, have investments in the United States worth a stunning $860 billion. This number would make approximately 7 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product.     Besides the big money involved from the Saudis, what do you think is the Bush administration's main priority in its 'war on terror'? How much of a 'black sheep' is Osama in the Bin Laden Family? What are the Bin Laden-Bush links? What deals existed between the Taliban and a major Californian oil company? Was the Taliban ever given the red carpet in Houston, back in 1997, when a well-known individual was the governor of Texas? Does Halliburton play a big role in Bush's government corruption or is this just another leftist diatribe?       'Farenheit 9/11' probes into these and other questions with staggering details and a big dose of sarcastic humour injected by Moore's narrating and acting (check Moore handing over applications to U.S. congressmen and talking them into having their children enlist for military duty in Iraq)      Iraq could not be left out of 'Farenheit.' Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke could not put it more bluntly when it came to demystifying the rationale behind invading Iraq: he was being pressured by the administration to fabricate incriminating evidence that would link Saddam Hussein to the Sept. 11 attacks. He even went so far as to say that Bush had plans to invade Iraq even before 9/11. Recall that Clarke's statements were made during a senatorial commission (included in the film) months before the most revealing documentation to date rebutting Bush's casus belli in Iraq came out this October.    In spite of huge anti-war protests worldwide and the constant flip-flopping of pretexts and all other nonsensical rant to justify the invasion, little could be done to stop the war machine. But what happens when the 'freedom-poised'- U.S. and coalition soldiers take over Iraq after six weeks of 'shock and awe' blitzkrieg?   'Farenheit' includes some disturbing scenes that the media for some reason neglected: Iraqi mothers and fathers crying hopelessly for their dead children,whose blood -stained, torn bodies are being pulled out of what remains of their homes after an air raid; entire families being terrorized in the middle of the night all while marines drag off men from their homes in the most humilliating fashion all while their children, women, and relatives stand by in panic; hooded prisoners being paraded around and fotographed as if they were trophies of war, with all the chauvinistic and dehumanizing attitude that surely nourished the prisoner-torture atmosphere that sufficed later in the Abu Ghraib case.    Most war correspondents in Iraq have said that their being embedded with coalition soldiers has putrestrains to portray a balanced, objective picture of the conflict. Yet, the Swedish cameraman who provided most of the takes to Moore was an embeddded journalist himself, and blames CBS, CNN, MSNBC, and others for refusing to accept his material. More interestingly, he says that most of his takes showing U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners and night raids are commonplace and not random incidents, so he questions why aren't the embedded journalists reporting them as they should (For more complete info, check the Swedish journalist's interview on the DVD features).    Now, the documentary falls short of 5-star rating because it fails to address one of the most fanatic and dangerous driving forces behind the shaping of the Bush administration's foreign policy. These missing dots are crucial understand the present Afghan, Iraqi, and U.S.-U.N-Europe diplomatic crises. First, the  agenda of militarizing the world oil-rich regions and the unilateral 'preventive war' doctrine as stipulated in neo-con  manifestos(for example, the Project for the New American Century). Second, the role of Israel's hardliners for regime change in what it deems unfriendly countries (Iraq, Iran, Syria)and their policy of ethnic cleansing in Palestine's occupied territories.    This important omission, however, should not deter you from buying or seeing this film; a whole lot of important material still is shown uncensored in 'Farenheit 9/11,' which besides exposing how scandal-ridden and disastrous the Bush administration has proven so far, it also puts the heat on the media's reluctance to distinguish fact from unchallenged government propaganda.    To make a long story short, 'Farenheit 9/11' remains a living testimony of why Michael Moore's at the top of political documentary-making in the United States and why you need to cast your vote in November. This film is a must-see, if not a must-have.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|One of the best CD's I've bought this year. Far beyond any of the other young musicians of the genre. Make that any genre. It's a CD that is mixed with a lot of music, and this guy delivers. He sways between different styles really easily and I'm not even sure what category to put him in. Influences I hear are Elton John, Sting, Oscar Peterson, and Ray Charles. But it's 100% Peter Cincotti. He can really sing, his piano playing is A list, and his song writing really knocks me out. See for yourself!
6302732786|1.0|Unbelievable.  Simply unbelievable.  How these \\"so called\\" video editors could cut out the very best performance of the entire concert is beyond me.  Without the show stopping performance of Extreme and their melody of Queen tunes this is just an average concert.  Whoever is responsible for cutting Extreme out of the final cut should be ashamed of themselves.  They need to find a new line of work because evidently they aren't even qualified to edit my home movies.<br /><br />What a disappointment this DVD was. :(
B0002858YS|2.0|See Blur, Oasis, Franz Ferdinand, The YYY's, the Strokes, the Features for far superior offerings of the same formula.  I know exactly what these young men are up to and their are many others who do it far better --<br /><br />particularly those they are affectedly emulating..<br /><br />Looks like corporate is hip to a new wave.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|I'll be brief:  A Young listener since 1982.  This is one of my top 3 Young ablums.  No, I don't think that it's necessary to have a story that makes complete sense to have a great album.  I don't think you need to have songs that stand out as singles.  No one song stands out here.  Kind of like in football:  no one player is bigger than the team.  Here, most of the tunes take the same basic chord progressions, nothin fancy, but just picture yourself around a campfire and ol uncle Neil is crooning away....pure pleasure.  I find myself able to listen to this album 6, 7 or 8 days in a row.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Long before Santana realised that there were millions to be made from pop music he was actually a truely serious musician, this proves it. <br />So its not so polished as Abraxas or Santana 3 but neither musters the sheer energy that this album does, from the first track to the legendary Soul Sacrifice, the rythm section is explosive laying down Afro-Cuban Grooves for Santana and Rolie to play over.  <br />My personal favourite is treat (which, excuse the pun is a treat) Rolies piano work is exquisite creating a late night jazz feeling and then that magnificient precussion team jumps into action giving it a real latin feel to it. <br />The live tracks are no fillers as well, with THAT version of Soul Sacrifice they hardly could be though, and what is probably the definitive version of Fried Neckbones (Jose Areas trumpet solo is real sweet as well)
B00005JM4Z|5.0|First, let me say that I decided not to watch this movie when it came out summer 2003. I was so turned off from the first one (Fast & the Furious) that I though the sequel will be a waste of time & money (most sequels tend to flop nowadays). The cars in the first movie were ok, but there was no plot...basically none...nada!! Not to mention Ja Rule only showed up in the movie to get dissed? lolol...serves him right. Fast & Furious was lame overall, but Vin Diesel stole the show (hands down). So, I'm disappointed that he wasn't in this sequel though.     So I rented & watched the DVD 1yr later expecting to see another dumb sequel.     I was wrong...    This movie finally has a decent plot that gelled all parts of the movie together into one exciting rollercoaster ride.    The cars, were much better, waaaaay faster, not to mention the girls and the setting (how can u beat Miami?). The first race totally blew me away. Incredible Car Stunts!! Not to mention the cars. Skyline? Spider? Evo VII? The 2 Hemi monsters? American Muscle?...What more cars could u ask for Man? They even rolled out the whole pack of cars near the end. The police aren't that stupid. It's just flat-out fast paced action from the word \\"GO!\\" The driving maneuvres during all chases were well done.    Paul Walker's a pretty cool actor...I respect the man. Tyrese was just too funny. Eva Mendes is so pretty, that I've stopped dreaming of J-Lo. Ludacris & Devon Aoki look so cute together. Not to mention the villian (Cole Hauser), he was stoned cold. All the actors were tight.     How can I forget the soundtrack? All the tracks are flat-out club bangers that fit the scenes like a glove. That track during the buildup to the 1st race (when the skyline was driving in) was my favorite. You'll be feeling the beats for real.    To me this is one of the hypest movies I've seen that really lived up to it's name...definitely one of the best urban movies I've ever seen in a while now. You won't get tired of this movie, and you'll want to watch it over and over again. This movie is a keeper for all car-lovers.     Should they do \\"Fast & Furious 3\\" with Vin Diesel back in with Paul Walker, Tyrese in it, true justice will be surely be served.    This movie rocks! Why? It's all about the cars baby!
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I thought that this was by far one of the best movies ever. It was better than harry potter and the philosophers stone and the chamber of secrets. I also thought that it was as good as the book even better.
B00005JMXX|3.0|If you like BIG effects, BIG, WORLDWIDE, CATACLISMIC storms, and Dennis Quaid--you're easily suckered.  I'll admit that the effects are incredible and realistic and BIG, but the movie is nothing to get excited about...but hey, if you've got nothin to do, pull up a chair, get out the string cheese and enjoy a long environmental scolding.
B0000D96NW|4.0|I guess jumping on one bandwagon gives license to jump on another, or maybe Robb Flynn has finally pulled his head out of his butt.  Seeing how the rap-rock thing has died out (thank god) and a heavy trend is now in tow, Machine Head more or less return to form with Through the Ashes of Empires.  Opening track \\"Imperium\\" is the bludgening assault that is reminiscent of their classic debut \\"Burn My Eyes\\", with Robb's voice sounding the best it has in the past few years and the best guitar work (from new guitarist Phil Demmel) since Logan Madder was on board.  Other standout tracks include \\"Bite the Bullet\\", \\"In the Presence of My Enemies\\", and the closing \\"Descend the Shades of Night\\" are solid and about ten times better than almost anything from \\"Supercharger\\".  Yes it's heavier than their past two albums, but I wouldn't exactly call \\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\" a return to form for Machine Head.  Hopefully this is just a taste of things to come for the band, and Robb has finally decided not to follow any more bandwagons.
B000000OSG|3.0|If I have to criticise one thing about Use Your Illusion 2 it's its the production.I think whereas Use Your Illusion 1 was a straight forward rock album, Use Your Illusion 2 sees Guns n Roses reaching for a higher level of quality.When the album opens up with Civil War, you know that you're in for something serious. A take from \\"Cold Hand Luke\\" followed by a slow lamenting guitar. But as soon as Axl starts singing \\"look at your women crying, look at your young men dying\\" the effect changes from deep to embarassing, and the deep ballad quickly becomes a pitiful Chariots of Fire. The song drags on and on and eventually the guitars kick never reaching a climax, and then the song drifts off.By that time, you have had a bit of yawning. \\"14 years\\" and \\"yesterdays\\" pick up the pace a bit but at an unhappening level. The fourth song is the cover of Dylan's \\"Knockin'on Heavens Door\\", working lethargically well as a whole. The band gets in action with the rocking \\"Get in The Ring\\" and \\"Shotgun Blues\\" with a slight dissapointment: Axl's lyrically poor and annoying vocabulary. <br />Surpisingly though this is not the worst part of the album. Rather, the worst part is the sloppy pit in which the Gunners fall from hereon in. An unmelodic \\"Breakdown\\", followed by a monotonous \\"Pretty Tied Up\\", a neverending \\"Locomotive\\", an unpresent \\"So fine\\" and a nowheregoing 9 minute \\"estranged\\" in which Slash's segregated solo riffs reminiscent of \\"November Rain\\" leftovers, with much less structure and character. The pace picks up again with the visceral \\"you could be mine\\", but it just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, being followed by a weak second \\"don't cry\\" showing much less effort and dynamism than in the first version.The last song sees Axl having a quite irritating  indulgent moment for one minute.So there you have it, use your illusion 2, a languid and indulgent production for the \\"best rock band\\" in the world. <br />The breakdown of the songs: <br />Civil War 8/10<br />14 Years 6/10 <br />Yesterdays 5/10 <br />Knockin' On Heavens Door 7/10 <br />Get in the Ring 7/10 <br />Shotgun Blues 7/10 <br />Breakdown 4/10 <br />Pretty Tied Up 6/10 <br />Locomotive 6/10 <br />So Fine 4/10 <br />Estranged 6/10 <br />You Could Be Mine 8/10 <br />Don't Cry 4/10 <br />My World 5/10
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is the first Nightwish album I've bought, although I've been somewhat familar with their other stuff for a while now. I've only had it for a little over a week and all I can say is: WOW!!!!! I can't stop playing it, it is just that great! \\"Once\\" is epic, symphonic metal like no other, due in large part to Tarja's impressive vocals, (she puts any popular female singer in the US to shame!) although there's no shortage of talent in rest of the band either. The orchestral and choral arrangements are absolutely spectacular and beautiful while not detracting from the good hard edge of the rest of the music. The only tiny weak spots are two songs in the middle, \\"Dead Gardens\\" and \\"Romanticide\\", possibly making the rating closer to 4.5 stars, but the two bonus tracks more than make up for them. This is the kind of metal we should have on the radio here in the US, instead of most of the stuff you hear-made by idiots who can't play or sing! This is definitely for anyone who likes their music a little more complex and classically/operatically influenced, such as (my favorite) Queensryche, Stratovarius, Symphony X, Royal Hunt, etc.
B00013PHGS|4.0|How can you compare Air to Bjork?  They are from two different worlds.  This is another good release from Air.  Very creative.  I look forward to quality music like this, unfortunately it is limited.  It might be a little esoteric musically, but that's because you've all been listening to crap for too long. You've forgotten (or you never knew) what good music sounds like.  If that's the case, then Air is a good place to start.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|\\"Wicked\\" is simply one of the most awesome musicals ever.  I am involved in theatre, so I have been around quite a few.  Idina Menzel is absolutely amazing.  It is too bad that she is leaving in January because the show will never be the same without her.  Luckily, though, I will get to see her before she leaves.  This soundtrack is definitely worth far more than the mere $13.49 that it will cost you.  Get it as fast as you can!!!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|In Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\" (1992), there is no ethical code associated with the classic Western, no simple moral of good versus evil. It is an unromanticized depiction of the West in which every bullet - and every death - has meaning. \\"Unforgiven\\" is a culmination of the dark themes that director Eastwood has explored in \\"High Plains Drifter\\" (1973) and \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" (1976). He pays homage to the stark poetry of the Western while staking his own territory of uncompromised reality. The distortion of justice in \\"Unforgiven\\" is reminiscent of the tragic, wrongful hanging in director William Wellman's \\"The Ox-Bow Incident\\" (1943) - both films confront the horrible consequences of murder and how the killers must live with it. In his final Western, Eastwood shows that the genre can be given new life through provocative explorations of myth and legend, along with an intelligent script and sensitive direction.
B00005JN7O|5.0|\\"Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow\\" is a wonderfully entertaining and refreshingly unique action flick that stands head and shoulders over any other recent films of the genre.  I was stunned by the lush visuals, gorgeous lighting, period costumes, rich colors and overall style of the film.  Whoever said style over substance was a bad thing?<br /><br />\\"Sky Captain\\" is riddled with references to films of the 30's and 40's and old adventure comic books.  This nostalgia is what gives \\"Sky Captain\\" its own unique persona that has so amazed critics and audiences worldwide.  In the troubled world we live in today, many yearn for simpler times, and the best way to revisit the past is, of course, through film.  In \\"Sky Captain\\", I fond comfort in the simplistic beauty of times past.<br /><br />From the opening moments, as snow falls on a Gotham-like a scene, Director Kerry Conran sets the mood and style as he docks the massive airship Hindenburg III to the top of the Empire State Building in a sequence so astounding and breathtakingly real; so of the moment, that it fills audiences with an awe and wonder.  Conran takes a palpable joy in his filmmaking, an enthusiasm that sweeps you off your feet.  The visuals in \\"Sky Captain\\" are, simply put, are among the most astounding I have ever seen in a film.  No wonder Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi were all scrambling to be a part of this soon-to-be classic film!<br /><br />The story is by no means bad, as it has been suggested by many, but rather it is much more basic than most action flicks nowadays.  Frankly, I loved the simplicity of the story, which once again reminded me of Old Hollywood.  There were no annoying, pointless subplots that so confused me that I found myself frustrated with the film as I left the theater.  The fun, witty script kept me entertained and I found that I had a large, goofy grin on my face practically the entire film.  The whole thing was just so darn fun and lovable that I couldn't help it!  By far the year's best film.vable that I couldn't help it!  By far the year's best film. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Finally someone has said what everyone has  been thinking,it is refreshing to hear what you already suspected was true.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|Despite it technically being Roger Waters' first solo album, only under the Floyd name, but under that criteria, then Animals, The Wall, and Wish You Were Here were all written in majority by waters so where do you draw the line? Was Zenyatta Mondatta the first STING solo album? ( see where I'm going )  Roger Waters likes to write about war and why not. he's brilliant at it!  In any event, I was too young to appreciate floyd in their prime, so I went through what many gen X and Y'ers go through and that was 'Floyd Stages'. Before I even knew about any Waters solo albums, This was my favorite one because it was the least contemporary. This album really does more with less telling the story of a post world war 2 era from a number of different perspectives. It truly plays a film in your mind    This album is not Dark side of ther Moon so to compare it as such is an unfair argum,ent to begin with. Dark Side was a sonic masterpiece whereas The Final Cut though musically engaging is a mellow, moody, weaving piece of work that is best experienced ( as most floyd albums ) as a complete work.     This is Roger Waters at his most comfortable writing wise and it really comes through. If you've never head this disc, but have heard more popular Floyd albums, think of tracks like \\"Nobody Home\\" from the wall as a good point of reference.    A clear departure from the more obviously bigger productions of floyd past but as I said before, The Final Cut is apples and The Wall is Oranges. The songwriting and music are honest with a political tint and dash of trademark floyd accents like background noises.    If you like THE FINAL CUT then Waters' solo albums are a must and if're like me, althought I love the floyd stuff. Waters' solo material is just more mature. Quirky at times, but shining at most, THE FINAL CUT is a nice break from the overproduction of most floyd albums and allows a listener to not be listening on their heels the first go around.     There's no catchy hooks or floyd anthems on here, just a piece of music that absoloutley NO ONE ELSE could have ever written back then, now or in 20 more years. It's a shame this album get's forgotten amoung the other floyd gems.
B00004BZ16|3.0|I agree with other reviewers, there are some definite misses on this album.  Also, if you cant stand reggae or dub rhythms, Sandinista will not appeal to you.  This album is not fast or agressive or as iconoclastic as other clash albums.    Other than that this album lets us see a very different band than on London Calling or The Clash.  The quartet dabbles in a variety of musical styles and carries recurring riffs and themes through a number of songs.  As such like the white album this album has a raw, unpolished feel.  It goes so many directions and at the same time the creative and intuitive ear for music the band has is apparent.  Even some of the weaker tracks are not complimented by a lack of imagination or laziness.
1400034205|5.0|On reading the first three pages of this book i thought i was in for a long haul of upperclass victorian drama in drawing rooms and typical unrevolutionary writing, but i trudged through and all of a sudden the book takes on this fresh life, and the ideas and lifestyle expressed by the protagonist are simply breathtaking, and really life-changing. It is also a great social criticism of its time. The female characters are typically Maugham yet completely believable. I found this book to be incredibly entertaining and is the first book to change my life since reading the virgin suicides when i was 16. A fantastic exploration of the self and a bit of mysticism thrown in, just read it.
B00006GA4C|5.0|I remember when this was fondly called \\"The Red Album\\", this recording was a maturing of the classic GFR sound that rocked a nation.  This recording can melt your speakers, man!  Listening to this helps me to not forget when rock was raw, mean and funky.  For a three man band, GFR had it together and seemed to have alot of passion doing it.  So they were not the best musicians in the world and their songs here are a bit dated but c'mon now who plays like this anymore...NO ONE!  So buy this recording, blast it loud and show your neighbors what real rock use to sound like.  This will make a hip-hop fan's ears bleed!
B000067J1H|5.0|Leave all of your preconceived notions about Pitt and his Hollywood high-profile marraige behind and add this DVD to your collection immediately!  This disc is one you'll not only play again and again for its stunning visual effects and twisting tale turns, you'll have it running on you big screen as background art for your next party performance.  The constellation of outstanding writing, convincing acting and daring direction make this movie a work of tremendous accomplishment, often under-rated and overlooked.  But if you have even the smallest of DVD collections, this must be added.  Don't believe me, refer to a resource like Entertainment Weekly.
B000068QVN|4.0|Since \\"Live Album\\" was my favorite GFR recording, when I first saw this CD I got very excited and being the GFR fan that I am I of course had to have it.  Is it as good as \\"Live Album\\"? No it is not.  This is mainly due to the repetition of songs from the original \\"Live Album\\".  However, it must be understood that these recordings were taken from live performances around the same time period, with a similar play list as \\"Live Album\\" so of course there is repetition.  Also, the energy does not seem as electrifying as with \\"Live Album\\".  This could be due to the performances captured here or the way they were recorded.  Whatever the case may be, this CD still shows that GFR (at the time) beats any group performing then or now for un-polished rockin' energy and simple raw power.  Not to mention that GFR was one of the musically tightest bands around.  GFR was selling out huge stadiums and every hippie kid was diggin' what GFR was puttin' down.  GFR, with their long hair, loud driving rhythms and political commentary was the voice of a generation.  It just goes to show me how we desperately need that today.  Thanks to all who put this CD together and to Mark, Don and Mel for playing their butts off!
B000002UA0|4.0|Syd Berret is completely overrated. He went insane even before the band created its signature albums like DSOTM, The Wall, and Wish you were Here. He may have turned the band in the psychadelic direction, but Waters was an infinitely better songwriter.  <br /> <br />Compare \\"Hey You\\" to \\"Bike\\", or \\"Time\\" with \\"Octopus\\" and its no contest, Waters beats Berret everytime.
B00006GA48|5.0|There is no doubt that GFR was really on fire when they recorded Closer To Home.  This is truly GFR's creative peak.  From the album opener \\"Sin's A Good Man's Brother\\" to the FM classic \\"I'm Your Captain\\" this album is GFR's best studio effort.  This is a must have in any GFR fans collection and an excellent introduction to any new listener of Mark, Don & Mel. A rockin' classic!
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT movie!  While the movie departs further from the book, the story is top-notch with the right touch of human element and motivation. <br /> <br />However, the camerawork is absolutely, drop-dead painful to watch.  I hate watching a movie where I can't guess what is going on because there's a flurry of \\"somethings\\" across the screen while I'm reaching for the Dramamine.  You can almost hear a collective sigh of relief from an entire movie audience when the hyperactive cameraman stops jostling about - presumably because he's throwing up off screen. <br /> <br />It's such a pity, too, because I do like the story.  It's worth watching just for that -- hopefully, the camerawork on a TV screen is not as painful an experience.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Bowie is one of my favorite musicians of all time. His album 'Hours' was the last one I enjoyed - 'Heathen' was a bit of a disapointment for me. But here, we see a solid album with numerous inspirations, and sounds great beginning to end. <br /> <br />'New Killer Star', 'Never Get Old', 'Days', 'Bring Me the Disco King' - all these tracks pure gold. <br /> <br />If you liked 'Hours', or indeed any Bowie album ever, get this.
B000002UEB|5.0|I have always LOVED this album.  And, I just saw Queensryche this past weekend and they did all of Operation: Mindcrime live after a greatest hits set.  It was amazing to see it live.  I am listening to the CD right now, AMAZING PIECE OF WORK.  Spend the money, get a ticket if they are coming to your area.  Buy the disc if you don't have it.  VERY POWERFUL.   <br /> <br />This is such a spectacular work and I am so excited since I found out at the concert that they are releasing a sequel to Mindcrime next year (2005).  So if you love this one it is worth checking into.
B000683VI4|5.0|I was reading 1996 Nicolas Sparks-The Notebook and i did enjoyed to read the book repeated and finally The Notebook release 3 weeks ago(in Australia) i watched and it touched my heart and cried at the end of the scene. It was the MOST loveable story and i could'nt wait to get a DVD coming out next Feb. Ryan and Rachel was a remarkable actors especially James Garnder and Gena Rowland were fanastic too.. Hey get a nominee-Acadmey awards please.. smiles..
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II(1969). Led Zeppelin's Second Album.<br /><br />In 1968, Led Zeppelin debuted, shocking the world with their gritty, heavy, bluesy heavy metal that critics hated but the public loved. Their debut, spawning the hits \\"Dazed And Confused\\" and \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\", was a surprise chart-topper, that went on to be Platinum, and gave fans reasons to pray for a new album. In 1969, Led Zeppelin answered the fans' prayers and released their creatively titled 'Led Zeppelin II', an album that used the same bluesy heavy metal sound, yet seemed a little darker and more mature than it's predecessor, at times talking about Mythology and Lord of the Rings. The album went to the top of the charts, and was a massive success, partly because of the singles 'Whole Lotta Love', 'What Is And Never Should Be', 'Heartbreaker', 'Living Loving Maid(She's Just A Woman)', 'Ramble On', and 'Moby Dick', clearly showing that almost all of 'Led Zeppelin II\\"'s content is played on the radio on a regular basis. Although Rolling Stone later warmed up to Led Zeppelin and Heavy Metal, they hailed 'Led Zeppelin I' and 'Led Zeppelin II' as \\"disasters\\". Do I agree with this or not? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Whole Lotta Love- Proving Led Zeppelin's startling maturity from 'Led Zeppelin', \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is a sleazy song about sex that has since become a Zeppelin favorite. Plant basically moans and groans his way through, all the while dishing out those falsetto vocals and sarcastic lyrics. Page's performance is awesome! Although there are many points where he hardly plays his guitar, his odd and trippy effects, and off-key beats, not to mention his show-stealing solo, make his performance worthwhile. Jone's bass is probably his strongest, a seedy and addictive bassline that fits the song perfectly. Bonham is amazing too. Although not their best, quite a worthwhile song.<br /><br />What Is And What Should Never Be- Although \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" seems to have heavy influences of Folk and New Age, it doesn't take away from the song at all. Plant's singing finds him belting out mysterious lyrics, and Page's take on Folk Guitar makes for quite a listen. Not Zeppelin's best, but an undeniably good song.<br /><br />The Lemon Song- Possibly Led Zeppelin's bluesiest song, \\"The Lemon Song\\" finds Plant relating an odd tale, all the while Page is breaking his wrist playing blues riff after riff, not to mention an incredible solo. Jone's bass is a crucial element here, and \\"The Lemon Song\\" is an often overlooked, yet great song that finds Zeppelin playing their roots.<br /><br />Thank You- Almost scarily similar to The Rolling Stones and The Who, \\"Thank You\\" is an acoustic ballad, finding Page giving a melodic and emotional edge to the song with his soothing acoustic guitar, all the while Plant remembers lost love. One of Led Zeppelin's strongest ballads.<br /><br />Heartbreaker- Right from the start, \\"Heartbreaker\\" grabs you with Page's searing electric guitar chords, and Plant's seedy and unapolegetic singing makes \\"Heartbreaker\\" one of the finest Heavy Metal songs of its time. Page's guitarmanship is priceless: his incredible bluesy riffs, solos, and guitar licks give Jimi Hendrix a run for his money.<br /><br />Living Loving Maid(She's Just A Woman)- Led Zeppelin doesn't give you a break, speeding up the tempo even more for \\"Living Loving Maid\\", a psychadelic blues rocker that keeps the energy and party tone Led Zeppelin fans have come to know and love. Plant's metallic, AC/DC-ish guitar lick, not to mention his numerous solos, only makes this song better...<br /><br />Ramble On- A song heavily inspired by Mysticism and The Lord of The Rings, \\"Ramble On\\", a powerful rocker that seems to flawlessly blend Folk with Heavy Metal, all the while keeping that \\"medieval\\" feel. Page is perfect here, ripping out those power chords without hesitation, and oddly sounding like The Allman Brothers. Plant's vocals are tame andpronounced, the way they should be. A great melodic rocker!<br /><br />Moby Dick- Probably 'Led Zeppelin II's weakest, \\"Moby Dick\\" starts off spectacuarly with Page ripping out some power chords, but it soon evolves into a John Bonham drum solo, which, I'm sad to say, is rather weak. It goes back to normal at the end, but the songs already over and done with by then.<br /><br />Bring It On Home- Beginning with a harmonica, \\"Bring It On Home\\" starts off as a folk ballad, yet out of nowhere turns into an insane rocker, full of feet stomping and fist pumping riffs, not to mention angry vocals and weird lyrics. In more than one way, a very good song.<br /><br />Overall, 'Led Zeppelin II' may have its flaws, yet, like any Led Zeppelin album, it's impossible for me to give it anything less than a perfect rating. With their second album, Led Zeppelin improved in every way upon their debut, upping the heaviness and energy of their bluesy rock, and they began to show why they'd earn a part of almost everybody's album collection. Page is fantastic here, and Jones gives one of the most noteworthy performances by a bassist I've heard in a long time.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF CLASSIC ROCK, BLUES, AND LED ZEPPELIN! BELIEVE IT OR NOT, LED ZEPPELIN WOULD ONLY GET BETTER!<br /><br />Killer Kuts- \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\", \\"The Lemon Song\\", \\"Thank You\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Living Loving Maid(She's Just A Woman)\\", and \\"Ramble On\\".<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />Led Zeppelin IV(AKA Zoso)- Led Zeppelin<br /><br />Electric Ladyland- Jimi Hendrix<br /><br />Disraeli Gears- Cream<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!vocals are tame and pronounced, the way they should be.

6305546797|4.0|I saw this film originally as a teenager in the theatre and it gave me the chills.  I haven't revisited this film in a number of years and was prepared to dismiss it as a well-crafted slasher film.  To my surprise, the movie still had me on the edge of my seat.  Credit has to be given to John Carpenter who, on a low-budget, has made a film comparable to the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock.  He utilizes editing, cinematography(I noticed Oscar winning cinematographer for \\"Dances With Wolves\\", Dean Cundey, did the lensing here)and his own creepy music score to maximum effect.  The acting here is basically perfunctory, actors playing victims awaiting their slaughter by psycho Michael Meyers.  Donald Pleasance, the nominal star here, makes occasional appearances as Dr. Loomis to explain the evil that has returned to sleepy Haddonfield, Illinois.  In her film debut, Jamie Lee Curtis does reasonably well as Laurie Strode, the lone teen who can muster enough intestinal fortitude in combatting the \\"boogieman\\" who has returned to town.  A note of trivia, though this is Curtis' film debut, I used to watch her prior to this film on a TV sitcom based on the film, \\"Operation Petticoat\\" where she played a nurse.  Another note of trivia is that her father, Tony Curtis, starred in the theatrical version of \\"Operation Petticoat\\".
B000002KIE|4.0|This is the first \\"real\\" punk album i ever owned and when i hard it was powerful and kicked a lot of ass. The songs on here are chock full of witty cynicism and johnny rotten is hilariously brilliant ( too bad he became a stupid fart). Best songs: \\"holidays in the sun\\" , \\"sub-mission\\", \\"bodies\\" and \\"pretty vacant\\"
B000002UAR|5.0|A fine effort by a little English band from the 1960s, which also happened to be the best group in the history of contemporary music. In addition to the undeniably great favorites that everyone knows and loves, Revolver contains lesser-known gems, including two of the most sublime bits of psychedelic pop ever committed to magnetic tape: \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"And Your Bird Can Sing.\\"  With this album, the Beatles' polished their songwriting and recording craft to a fine lustre, definitively crossing the line that separates the experimental, studio-based \\"later Beatles\\" from the performance-based \\"early Beatles.\\"  If you don't already know these tunes by heart, this disc will warmly reward your attentions. <br />
B00004W52U|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest albums ever written. The cd contains the album Energy plus the eps Hectic and Turn it around. Op Ivy were able to mix ska and punk perfectly. All the songs on this album are fast short and insightful. There are some political themes touched upon but mostly there are a lot of sociatal topics covered. The first few rancid records would sound like a pumped up version of Op Ivy but ultimately Tim Armstrong went insane. Jesse Michaels was the voice of a generation but he ultimately started shopping at the gap and became a metrosexual. Best songs are:\\" the crowd\\", \\"one of these days\\", \\"smiling\\", \\"healthy body\\" , and \\"freeze up\\".
B0002OERI0|5.0|I'm not a huge Greenday fan. I've got a few of their CDs and nothing really stood out as being really really good. Well, that is until I got my paws on American Idiot. Damn, this CD is amazing. It's definately the best CD so far for 2004. Hands down. <br /> <br />Jesus Of Suburbia and Homecoming are tracks that definately stand out for me... The whole CD is awesome.  <br /> <br />Highest recommendation, even if you are not a fan of Greenday. <br />
068987474X|5.0|From the moment I heard Mr. Behrendt and co-author on TV talking about this book, I HAD to get it!!! Since it was FLYING off the shelves, I lucked out and got a friendly associate at a bookstore that took my number and called me days later after they got more in, THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! <br /> <br />The format of the book is perfect, as if you are having a conversation with the authors. They said some things that I already knew and many that I had thought about but seeing it written in a book validated my thoughts. <br /> <br />Easy read, straightforward ways to deal with guys who simply are just not that into you. I tend to read toooo much into guys and try to figure out why they do what they do. Sometimes even blaming myself for a relationship not working out. But to say \\"he just wasn't that into me\\", stops me in my tracks. I don't try to \\"figure\\" guys out now and I see signs much quicker.  <br /> <br />Thank you for a WONDERFUL book!! I have highlighted, written in, dog-eared almost every page.
0679736646|5.0|This is my PKD festival time, as I am buying all the PKD novels and reading them straight one aft the other. I read UBIK after VALIS. There is a vast difference in the material and the plot. UBIK, is core sci-fi. It describes a society where, Psi, telepathic and precog ability is a norm and is considered a menace against society. Pre-cogs are people who have the native ability to predict events before they happen. You'll recognize the universe in this novel, if you have seen the movie. \\"Minority report\\" which is based on the short story by PKD of the same name.     The universe in this novel: In this PKD universe, People don't completely die, when they die so to speak. There is a continuous \\"half-life\\" which follows the death in full life. Here, People don't get buried when they die, but are kept in \\"Cold-Pac\\", that is they are kept in freezer like temperatures, connected to certain high-tech apparatus, due to which they can commune with the living for half hour periods a month till the half-life energy exist. This storage happens in moratoriums, where a relative could come, present the id no of the deceased after which the deceased will be pulled out to the consultation room and will be revived for real world communication with the visitor. The person continuous to be awake in half-life, that is the person continuous to live in his own mind, but communicating with the external world, requires the use of photo-phasons and the strength of photophasons keeps diminishing with more communication with the outside world. There are  photo-phason amplifiers which try to keep the half-lifer going as much as possible, but a time will come when the half-lifer will even consume this and then even half-life ends and actual brain-death also takes place. This is complete death, death in full and half-life, after which half-lifers take birth in other wombs to start a new life. In this way all energy in the universe is conserved. Anti-psi, anti precog and anti telepath are the people who can be hired, for keeping the Psi's, precogs and telepaths out. The Psi, Precogs and telepaths are not desirable elements as they are an affront to human privacy and hope as they can feel your thoughts and predict your future.     The story: Runciter Associates, a firm providing anti-force services, is run by Mr. Runciter who is  alive and Ella Runciter, his wife (in half-life). In matters of business, Mr. Runciter trusts the sharp business acumen of his wife even in half-life, but Ella is slowly dying, but despite this Runciter must revive her now and them for matters of business. The plot gets darker when the firm gets retained for very lucrative deal, the site of work being Luna. The other main character is Joe Chip who is the right hand man of Runciter. He is the group tester upon whom falls the responsibility of testing out the recruits when new talent is brought in by the bounty and to see if they are worthy enough to be recruited as part of the firm. Things don't go as planned on Luna and we are in for a very unnerving experience as PKD decides to confuse us as to what is real and what is an illusion. I won't spill out too much cause that would be an insult to PKD. The kernel ideas in this book are so central to the surprise element in the story that saying much may diminish the enjoyment impact of the book.    In a basic sense, PKD as in all his novels tries to make sense of what is real and what is unreal. Are we alive and if so what makes us think we are alive, what if actually we are all dead and someone else is alive and what we see and perceive as the real world is just an imaginary illusion. What if we are in the MATRIX, so to speak. What is actually that what we call real time, should it always move forward ?. What if real time is actually spiral time, time flowing backwards and what if this is the way it is actually and that we when alive perceive it as the real real time in reverse chronology, which for us, then falsely implies forward goingtime. The ideas and concepts are skillfully brought to the fore in this dynamite of a novel. At 200 pages odd, it's explosive and inventive shrapnel. You'll get hit by it, before you know what happened. So you want to know what is UBIK...obviously, it's the title and of the novel and you want to know what it means, rite...well,... What If I told you, UBIK is nothing and at the same time everything. That it is present everywhere and at the same time nowhere...doesn't make sense, does it? . Read the book, you will not regret it. THIS BOOK ROCKS !!!!    Lately I am doing a lot of PKD reading. By the time you are probably reading this, I would have reviewed a good many PKD books.I have stocked up on 7 novels of his, which I will be reviewing as I finish with them. I have come to the conclusion that the matrix movie has got to be a PKD idea, as I found out PKD talks about the MATRIX- programmer-reprogrammer and parallel multiple universe concepts in his speech \\"If you find this world bad, you should see some of the others\\". This speech is present in the compilation \\"The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick : Selected Literary and Philosophical Writings\\": edited by Lawrence Sutin. I highly recommend this to any die-hard PKD fan, although casual readers will also find many of his speeches on relality and perception very interesting indeed. I would have reviewed this too by the time you are reading this. You can find these reviews by clicking on \\"see all my reviews\\". I wish I have the best half-life yet !!!....or am I in half-life already...beats me !!!...but if I am in half-life, I hope I am getting into the best wombs to start with :) or do I say to start over with..:). As PKD says in his speech \\"This may not the best of all universes, but it's not the worst either\\"      Vikram
B000001DTM|5.0|Although plenty of people mark Joshua Tree as U2's best...this cd has got to be it.  Not to take anything away from Joshua Tree--an album that seriously kicks as.  The lyrics hit a lot closer to home than Joshua Tree...they lyrics are darker and more personal.  In fact, the lyrics will likely remind you of moments in your life.
0060989157|5.0|I first heard about this book on a local radio show(Drew and Mike... they rule) Well it sounded right up my alley. I have always been a big music buff, but I do not consider myself a really big Motley Crue fan. The format of this book is perfect for me and anyone else with a short attention span. The lives that the guys led is nothing short of amazing. I do not condone the actions of Vince Neil (killing and maiming of innocent people) but for the most part all they did was hurt themselves with their rambuncious behavior. And to think that they killed all those brain cells for my entertainment!!
B000002MG1|5.0|This is truly one of the best albums in the last 20 years.  In my opinion, the best REM album.  It isnt as \\"rock\\" as the 80's or Monster, but thats not a bad thing...get this album and see why it took the world by storm.
B00006D295|5.0|Ideally this shouldn't be available on DVD or VHS at all, because people should see it in the theater.  You won't \\"get it\\" watching this if you haven't seen it in a theater.  (Unfortunately our theater stopped showing it after the VHS tape came out.)  The amazing thing about seeing people act out the parts perfectly in the theater was knowing they learned it by going to the theater every week...not by practicing the parts at home. <br />  <br />Now on to the transfer: Someone commented about the sound being remixed.  What they didn't realize is that the stereo AND mono mixes are available on this disc, which is wonderful.  Most theaters show the mono version, yet the stereo remix used to be the only thing available on VHS (unless you had the Japanese import...).  And the live clips and audience participation aren't as bad as I thought they would be (that participation album is embarrassing!). <br /> <br />The actual sound fidelity is MUCH better on my hi-fi VHS tape though, although there *could* be something set wrong on the stereo downmix on the DVD players I've used (though I've used more than one and have fiddled with them all, and have tried both the mono and stereo versions). <br />  <br />Anyway this is a treasure for Rocky fanatics but not Rocky virgins.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Wow, Mr. Iglesias makes some of the most beautiful music to every come from the mouth of a person of Latin heritage.  His voice is smooth like sleeping in silk boxers smothered in silk sheets.  Yes I know that it sounds impossible but believe me he is that smooth.  My favorite song, possibly in the whole world, is Hero.  The english one not the spanish one because I can't understand that one.  He reminds me of a young Cheech Marin.
B000002H6C|5.0|blackened, harvester of sorrow and dyers eve and the shortest straw encompassed my attitude about life ( and here i turned out just fine!)  for a good 5 years, i played this tape so much in the years since its releaseit finally died and i bought it on cd. BUY it!
B0002KVULG|3.0|I am horrified (pun intended) by what director John Badham has done to this elegant, elegiac and atmospheric retelling of the Dracula tale.  When the film was originally released, it was widely noted that the use of color in the film was remarkable.  I remember telling a friend that it was almost like watching an oil painting move.  The texture of the color itself lent a sensuous beauty to the film in the same way that it did to the more recent Interview With The Vampire.  All that to say I was all set to relive that wonderful experience when I purchased this DVD.  Alas, it has been completely destroyed.  I will still enjoy the terrific performances and the wonderfully sexual slant on this oft-told tale, but the contributions of the art director and cimematographer have been compromised beyond imagining by some misguided, after-the-fact idea of the director.  Hopefully, someday, the Criterion Collection will get hold of this film so we can all see it the way it should be seen.
B0000X61VE|5.0|This workout video changed my life.  In combination with a diet and workout daily with this routine I lost over 100 lbs and took 10 inches off my waist in about six months.  I did this workout daily for over one year and never had ONE injury and my back never even hurt.  I find it highly unusual that, as mentioned in the amzon.com review, 12 people with back injuries went to the same chiropractor.  I don't know if the fitness \\"experts\\" who reviewed this workout are jealous, envious or what.  The editor Joan Price mentions in her amazon.com review, \\"She presents one after another of the exercises that fitness professionals threw out of their routines two decades ago.\\"  I imagine exercise routines are just like fad diets.  What all the \\"experts\\" and professionals considered effective and a must do today is out tomorrow.  Remember bran muffins? Eat them or die.  Whatever happened to that?  Oh, everyone's on Atkin's now.  I don't care if the routines in this workout are two decades old.  THEY WORK.  That's all that matters. <br /> <br />I had never used weights in my life and started off with 5 lbs weights and gradually over the months worked my way up to 15 lbs weights.  When you first begin this workout you will not be able to keep up with Cindy.  You'll definitely have to pause and rewind a lot when you first start so keep the remote close by.  But keep at it and eventually you'll be able to keep pace with Cindy.  This is a wonderfully effective workout and as I said before it was a life-changing event for me.
B00025ETIW|5.0|i just got into a Slipknot phase and i just bought this cd and its a breath of fresh atr from all the screaming (even thgo they are still my favorite band) this band is really really good
B00007LL7O|2.0|This band has sooo much potential, but they can't EVER pull it together. <br /> <br />What am I trying to say?  Well, Stratovarius makes 1 or 2 masterpieces on each album and every other song is a throw-out.  This album is no different, there's Eagleheart and A Drop In The Ocean, melodic and catchy as hell.  The rest are....boring.   <br /> <br />Other examples include:   <br />Infinite - Hunting High and Low, A Million Light Years Away <br />Fourth Dimension - Against The Wind, Distant Skies <br /> <br />Other than the two great songs per album, it's just the same ol stuff over and over.  Tolkki just does a fast guitar riff, terrible double bass pounding and Timo's lead vocal is just doing the same ol stuff on every fast strato song. <br /> <br />C'mon Strato, pull it together and give us a whole album.
B0000028RR|5.0|To all those uninformed people out there, who believe that Korn or Limp Bizkit invented rap/rock metal, think again. \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" are the ones who started it way back in 1992, even if they don't get much credit/hatred for it. This self-titled album put Rage on the map, and for good reason. This album rocks hard! The guitar and bass riffs are awesome, and the lyrics are filled with passion and anger. The songs on this album are highly original, as there weren't many other bands of this genre at the time for Rage to steal ideas from. If anything, you will enjoy this cd purely for the skills that Tom Morello displays on guitar, fusing funk with rock and metal so seamlessly, that the blend sounds uncontrived. This album was way ahead of its time in terms of rap/rock metal, and no other band has achieved the same level of quality and originality since. If you are into this genre of music, you will love this cd. It contains the song \\"Killing in the Name.\\" Need i say more?
B0000AZKPC|5.0|Wow, this band is INCREDIBLE.  They have the formula that Dream Theater and Stratovarius can NOT match.  POWER METAL WITH CONSISTANCY!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Each song on here has something to offer big time.  Tony is an amazing songwriter and singer. <br /> <br />Big highlights include - Blank File, My Land, Full Moon <br /> <br />They only get better with Silence.  Pick this one up today!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Heya. im an english fan of britney and this is what i think of her 4th album, in the zone :<br />1.Me against the music - git's ok, if you like big dance tracks then you'll love it but it's not my kinda thing 6/10<br />2.(I got that) Boom boom - okay, everyone has different taste and they're gonna like different things, but this is a seriously BAD song, it really is terrible. 1/10<br />3. Showdown - really good, the beat goes strong all the way through it and the effect of her voice in this song is amazing. 8/10<br />4. Breathe on me - When i listen to the album i usually skip this track, it's relativley good, but the way her soft, whispy voice contrasts with the strong beat of the song isn't good. 6/10<br />5. Early mornin' - I love this song, it works really well and it has a really cool r'n'b edge to it. 8.5/10<br />6. Toxic - I am in love with song. It's the work of pure genius. It's so different from everything else that she or anyone else has released. A little bit strange but still good. 9.5/10<br />7. Outrageous - I like this song and it's really good all the way through the song until it gets to the third verse, it completley changes from the morrocan r'n'b type music to some form of floaty pop that just doesn't work well. 8/10<br />8. Touch of my hand - it's all araibian at the begining which i never quite understood, but good vocals, big problem with this song is th chorus, it is so annying but it gets stuck in your head and you can't get rid of it for days! 7/10<br />9. The hook up - i don't like it. At all. It's an ok song but i can't stand this type of music. It's kind of rao mixed with r'n'b. Hate it hate it hat it! 2/10<br />10. Shadow - I love this type of music, i adore slow slushy songs, but the only problem with this song is that there are little sound effects all the way through it and it doesn't go well with the gorgeous sound of the music. Amazing chorus though. 9.5/10<br />11.Brave new girl - this isn't britney! it sounds like something of her first album, too poppy, in this song she completley looses her r'n'b edge and it's just pure pop. Not my thing. 4/10<br />12. Everytime - I LOVE THIS SONG! It is the best song on the album, in fact it's the best song off any of her albums and it's just so great and pretty and amazing. Then again, i am obbsessed with slushy love ballads so maybe it's not everyone's cup of tea, but it;s certainly mine! 11/10<br />13.Me against the music remix - I despise remixes. they're not good and they're a waste of space, don't waste your time listening to this track. 0/10<br />14. The answer - I think this track might be a UK bonus track but ill tell you about it anyway. It's bad, like all other bonus tracks. 3/10<br />15. Don't hang up 0- Bonus TRACK! 3/10<br />So, there you have it, an english persons view on britney, all in all i'd say this is a good album, maybe a couple of bad tracks, but any album has bad tracks. I'd say this was her second best. Ooops........is still her best album and i thnk it just pips in the zone to the post!
B00008H2LE|4.0|I am a huge fan of LP, but don't let that ruin my whole review. I was in anticipation for 'Meteora,' because I thought SIB was an awesome track. And when I listened to it in whole, I was amazed. It was still LP, but a little more mature. I know a lot of people may say that all they do is complain, but if you'd listen to the things LP say when they talk about their lyrics..  <br />\\"it's like silly therapeutic time,\\" <br />you gotta take that into consideration. Music is therapy, even if its talking about how mad they are at their cousin, or even MSI's lyrics about how they shoot up n*$@^*!s.  <br />But back onto the album.. I was pleased with it. I think the most unqiue track on the CD is 'Faint.' The beat count is different than any other song on the CD. Another good song is 'Numb.' A song on the album that they should have released as a single is 'Hit the Floor.'  <br />You'll either love it, like it, or hate it. But I'd say if you liked the singles from 'Meteora,' give it a try.
B00005JMXX|3.0|To watch this movie at all, one must first accept that the scenario presented here is possible. We aren't going to have an instant ice age due to a spontaneous climactic shift, but in this movie, that is exactly what happens, and the predictable high jinx ensue. <br /> <br />This is a special effects extravaganza, and little else. The plot and characters don't matter because you've seen it all before, and you know how it will end. It's a disaster movie, and you know what's going to happen to each and every person by the time you are introduced to them because this movie follows the basic formula. <br /> <br />Is it entertaining? Absolutely. I am not a fan of movies that have such little substance, but this one is at least a treat to the eyes and it is not overly graphic in cases where it could have turned the movie into a gory experience.  <br /> <br />Is it deep? Does it say something important about global warming? No. I think it tries to, and even the vice president has an eerie resemblance to environment hating Dick Cheney, but the entire message is lost as we watch New York get flooded with a tsunami and a mass exodus of Americans start flooding into Mexico.  <br /> <br />I would have given it a lower rating were it not for the fact I went into this movie with no great expectations.
068987474X|5.0|While I recognise that it's flip and casual and fun, this book also gives great advice: it could be a revolution, if only women would stop beating themselves up over men who aren't worth one coat of lip gloss.  This book may sound harsh to some, but I truly appreciate it's straight-forward manner.  <br /> <br />My favorite was Chapter Nine: He's Just Not That Into You If He's Disappeared On You.  This chapter provides a fine roadmap away from guys suffering from SIDS (Sudden, Inexplicable Disappearing Syndrome.)   <br /> <br />Ladies, do yourself a favor: buy this book. Keep it nearby and re-read it ever time you're tempted to let some guy into your heart who isn't worthy to lick the soles of your shoes!!
038572179X|1.0|Having enjoyed \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"Enduring Love,\\" I was deeply disappointed by \\"Atonement.\\" The plot could have been lifted directly from some recent talk show: Girl Falsely Accuses Older Sister's Boyfriend of Raping Cousin! How Her Lie Destroyed His Life! This topic would have possibilities in a contemporary novel, but the author transplants it into the interwar period, where it sits queasily. His evocation of the period is materially seamless; at least for this (under-30) reader, all the details clicked. But he views the richly conjured scene through the filter of his own late-century PC mores, which drains the period vigor out of it. He then destroys any credibility remaining to his characters by making it so that the young culprit, Briony Tallis, grows up to be (what else?) a feted author. The ruined and ultimately lost lives of her own sister and the sister's falsely accused boyfriend become the damage inflicted by her imagination on the world. What a labored \\"je m'accuse\\" this is. The screw of absurdity gets a final twist when an aged Briony, who has written the book's middle section (about WW II) from the point of view of the s.f.a.b., claims that in a hundred years it won't matter whether he really died in the war or not (!!) because he will live on in her own deathless prose. We are presumably supposed to take this for atonement. This was where I threw the book across the room and cursed its author for having temporarily persuaded me, through his gift for atmosphere, to believe in his main character's humanity, rather than seeing her immediately for what she is: a stilted projection of his own overblown ego.
B00006CXK0|5.0|The director's cut version of \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" available on DVD is one of the most disappointing expanded editions of a movie I have ever seen.  This is true not only because there the DVD edition is devoid of any extras, but mainly because the scenes that were added did not add anything significant and (even worse) a couple of well remembered scenes have had the music and editing changed, essentially wrecking them.  Fortunately, I still have my original laser disc edition of this 1992 film and the rest of your can soldier on with this videotape version.  Besides seeing the \\"original,\\" the other requirement is that you want to see this film letterboxed: when I saw the scene where the British troops and settlers leaving the fort after the surrender and attacked on both sides by the Hurons, I knew right then and there that seeing this movie in pan-and-scan was going to seriously dilute the experience.<br /><br />Director Michael Mann was inspired as much by 1936 Randolph Scott version of \\"The Last of the Mohicans,\\" with a screenplay by Philip Dunne, as he was by James Fenimore Cooper's original novel.  This is just as good, because after seeing Mann's movie I tried to read Cooper's novel and I could not even get halfway through that ponderous book.  This version is also skewed by the television series \\"M*A*S*H,\\" where the character of Benjamin Franklin Pierce was called \\"Hawkeye\\" because his father loved Cooper's novel.  Ironically, this meant the name was so identified with Alan Alda's character that it would no longer work in its original context.  But then the name of Cooper's hero was Natty Bumppo, and that was not going to work either, so in this incarnation our hero is called \\"Nathaniel.\\"<br /><br />Nathaniel is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, and his character spends a lot of time in this movie running through scenes with an intensity that becomes palatably ferocious at times.  Although filmed in North Carolina, the movie is set in upstate New York during the French & Indian War.  Nathaniel is hunting deer in the forest with his adopted family, Chingachgook (Russell Means) and Uncas (Eric Schweig) and planning on wintering down south in Ken-tuck-ee.  The French are invading and the local settlers are in danger, but this is not Nathaniel's concern.  But then he comes across signs of a Huron war party and comes to rescue of a party of British troops, led by the haughty Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington), and escorting Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and her younger sister Alice (Jodhi May) to Fort William Henry, commanded by their father, Colonel Edmund Munro (Maurice Roëves).<br /><br />The British party was betrayed by its scout, Magua (Wes Studi), who has been insulted by Colonel Munro and wants to see him dead and to wipe his seed from the earth.  Major Hayward, already angered by Cora's refusal of his proposal of marriage, is enraged by not only her interest in Nathaniel, but in the Nathaniel agrees to see to their safety and escrots them to the besieged fort.  The scene in which they enter, lit at night by only by the light of torches, while the musical score carries the scenes, is by favorite in a film filled with gorgeous photography and heroic music.  Mann has always thought in terms of that particular combination, going to back to not only his \\"MTV Cops\\" on \\"Miami Vice,\\" but his use of Iron Butterfly's 'In-a-gadda-da-vida\\" at the end of \\"Manhunter\\" (the original film version of \\"The Red Dragon\\" by Thomas Harris).  But in \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" he creates a sublime fusion between images and sound again and again throughout the film.<br /><br />The musical score by Randy Edelman and Trevor Jones is one of my all-time favorites and if I had to guess which non-musical soundtrack I have listened to the most in my life, this would be the winner (John Williams for the original \\"Star Wars\\" places and Randy Newman for \\"The Natural\\" shows).  Given the number of times this music has been used (to wit, ripped off) in movie trailers since then, I must not be alone in my thinking (I had a bias against \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" the first movie to employ \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" score in its trailer because of its heresy in doing so).  The opening deer hunt, the entrance into the fort, the stolen moments between Nathaniel and Cora, the canoe chase on the river, and the entire final chase up the mountain for the final battle, all rely on the music and the images, with a minimal of dialogue.<br /><br />I think that \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is a prefect date movie with a great balance between the romance and the action.  The romance is communicated with looks more than words.  The most romantic thing either one of them says is when Cora catches Nathaniel staring at her.  \\"What are you looking at, sir?\\" she demands.  \\"I'm looking at you, miss\\" he replied without averting his gaze.  When he has to abandon Cora to be able to save her and her sister, the closest he comes to telling Cora that he loves her is when Nathaniel tells her to stay alive, no matter what, promising \\"I will find you.\\"  Then they look at each other, trapped in a cave beneath a waterfall, drinking in the sight of each other for what could be the final time.<br /><br />As I indicated earlier, I had not read the novel \\"The Last of the Mohicans,\\" or even the Classics Illustrated comic book version.  For that matter I had not seen the 1936 version.  As a result, I did not know what was going to happen next in this film, and I was so caught up with what was happening that I actually sat in the theater wondering what was going to happen next when we were literally up to the final scene.  This movie is so captivating than even now, when I know the plot of Cooper's original story (Uncas and Cora are the doomed lovers), I dismiss the literary source in terms of Mann's cinematic result., ripped off) in movie trailers since then, I must not be alone in my thinking (I had a bias against \\"Legends of the Fall,\\" the first movie to employ \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" score in its trailer because of its heresy in doing so).

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I don't usually do things like this, but after reading through several of the reviews left for \\"Wicked\\" I felt it my duty as a trained musician and actor to set the record straight.     Like most of the other reviews I am giving it 5 stars, but that's about where the similarities end.  I was appalled to see how many reviewers gave songs like \\"Dear Old Shiz\\" and \\"Something Bad\\" low ratings because they deemed them \\"boring and unimportant\\".  I agree that these are not the most moving songs in the show, and they are not the ones that the audience or listener will walk away remembering, but they are ESSENTIAL to the formation of the plot and the progress of the show.  If you are just learning a musical you should NEVER skip over a track because it is \\"boring\\" more than likely it is boring so that the complexity of the piece doesn't distract from the important information being presented to you.  Telling a fellow listener to skip a track because it is boring is like telling a reader to skip a prologue that provides valuable background information or a chapter in the middle of the book because it ceased to hold your attention!      Musicals go through dozens of re-writes before opening night and if the song was not important to the plot it would have been removed.  \\"Dear Old Shiz\\" sets up so many things important to the plot...     1. This where Elphaba makes her first entrance, obviously an important moment.  2. It sets up the hierarchy at the school. We see where Galinda sits (literally), socially compared, to the rest of the students.  3. It provides us with the feeling of the school, this song, is in essence, their alma mater.    This is VALUABLE exposition information!    I can say the same thing about \\"Something Bad\\".  True, not the most moving piece in the show but again, but invaluable because of the information and relationship status it displays to the audience member.  I can't say it enough... \\"short and sweet\\" doesn't mean \\"boring and pointless\\".  You have tounderstand that the writers have compressed 400+ pages of a very complex novel into a 2 hour 45 minute musical; this information needs to get to us somehow.    Which brings up another topic, some people have given the show a bad review because it varied too much from the book, but these people either don't know or forget that Gregory Maguire was involved in the creative process of the musical and approved of the changes stating he understood they needed to be done in order for the show to work on the stage.      Also to those who are upset because it was much more lighthearted and happy than the book and deem this because Broadway is trying to sell tickets and appeal to the masses, all I can say is, exactly.  Broadway is a business, and when they create a show they are trying to create something that will run for years; if that means \\"dumbing down\\" the story as some of you put it to attract more people, then that is an artistic sacrifice most are willing to take.  Wicked cost $14 million to create, if they had written a show that didn't draw an audience, especially in a theatre as large as the Gershwin the show would have lost millions of dollars.      There is no reason a person can't enjoy the book and musical as two separate entities.  I do it, my sister does, and so does my boyfriend.  The show is based on the book, and albeit loosely, it is not intended to be the same story.          But back to the CD, I'm not going to lie, when I decide to not listen to the whole CD I do skip over these less intense songs, but in my own defense I've seen the show 12 times, owned the CD since before it was available in stores, and have read the book twice, so I am well aware of the background information and at this point I am simply playing the music to sing along, rev me up for a rehearsal, audition, or a day of work.      My favorite song on the album is \\"The Wizard and I\\" because I think it's a song all young people can relate to, we all have our own \\"Wizard\\" that we aspire to meet one day or become, and being fresh out of college, when Idina sings that song I can taste Elphaba's desire to become \\"something\\".  In same mind frame comes \\"Defying Gravity\\" because this is the point where Elphie decides it's time to make that dream come true and that she is going to embrace who she is and make her life her own despite what others around her say.    I agree with fellow reviewers who state that \\"The Wicked Witch of the East\\" should have been on the CD, and I told Michelle so myself after it first came out, but I understand that it would have been difficult to include it due to the amount of plot information revealed in that song.      I also love \\"The March of the Witch Hunters\\", as Norbert said in a backstage interview I had with him \\"Elphaba is the Osama bin Laden of Oz\\" and this song really shows it. Although reminiscent of \\"Kill the Beast\\" in \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" it shows us how much the people of Oz have grown to hate her, and all based on lies, a VERY important piece to the show, and very chilling.      Overall, my opinion is that one should never apply numbers to an individual song within a show because while it may be only a 4 or 5 to the ear, it is probably a 9 or 10 to the brain and plot.     All this being said, read the book for another mind blowing experience and a new perspective (beware it is vastly different from the musical plot)... just promise me you won't skip any chapters because they are boring!
B000002MG1|3.0|When this album came out I was still at a peak of worshipping REM.  I was sorely disappointed when I listened for the first time.  Rolling Stone had touted it as \\"REM's 'weird' new album\\".  Uh...yeah.   As a result I was expecting and hoping for something more like what we eventually got with 'Up'.  There were, however, a couple of songs I took to right away so I kept putting it on.  In the end I found half of it to be great and half a big ol' yawn.      Track by track:    1. DRIVE - Excellent.  One of my faves.  This song alone embodies everything that the 'Automatic' worshippers claim is true about the album as a whole.  The video is great too.    2. TRY NOT TO BREATHE - Another fantastic one.    3. THE SIDEWINDER SLEEPS TONITE - Ridiculously lame.  Made far worse than it would already be by the inclusion of the opening yodel from 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'.  As for the chorus, a friend was over when this song was playing and asked, \\"What is he saying?  Call me Charlie Baker??\\".  I do actually get some enjoyment out of this song because of that.  Still makes me laugh.    4. EVERYBODY HURTS - One of the worst songs by anyone ever.  Wretched.  Makes me embarrassed to tell people I'm an REM fan.  \\"Yes, I know 'Everybody Hurts' is a sickening song, but really, REM are good\\"    5. NEW ORLEANS INSTRUMENTAL NO.1 - Pointless.  I stopped buying REM singles for b-sides at one point because they usually turned out to be boring instrumental throwaways such as this.    6. SWEETNESS FOLLOWS - Stunning.  One of REM's absolute best tracks.  Another one that fully lives up to the hype.      7. MONTY GOT A RAW DEAL -  I like this one a lot too.    8. IGNORELAND -  REM's attempt at being edgy and sounding pissed.  I agree with everything this song stands for politically but I think their attempts at being 'rock' are far more successful on 'Document'.  This one says, \\"We can't rock\\".    9. STAR ME KITTEN - An extremely hushed and understated gem.    10. MAN ON THE MOON - Man, I hate this song.  It's really just a very bad Country tune.  ...And don't even get me started on Stipes Elvis impersonation.     11. NIGHTSWIMMING - Extremely 'OK'.  Could have been one of the lesser tracks on 'Green'.    12. FIND THE RIVER - Not the greatest but I do like this one.    Though I do consider this one to be really patchy, you could do worse than to start here.
B00000DI2T|2.0|Leonard Bernstein was indeed a great exponent of Mahler's music, especially during the sixties. But, I am sad to say, he was not always its best interpreter. Bernstein's presentations of Mahler are often big and bold - or, in other words, overloaded - and occasionally he even adds instrumental effects just to make the music to sound even more swollen (consider, for example, the addition of a bass drum stroke in the ultimate chord of symphony no. 1). Passages that require sophistication are often underlined with broad, syrup-sentimental strokes. This is especially the case with these late Mahler recordings, which Bernstein made for DG.<br /><br />In some people's taste, this is just wonderful. They want showpieces and nothing else. But other people might have other intuitions regarding Mahler's music. For example, they want orchestral balance and not too deliberate takes.<br /><br />Now this DG set is incredibly expensive - $191! My advice, if you want a set with Bernstein's Mahler, is to look for the set with his earlier recordings for CBS/SONY. You get it for a third of the price ($ 63), and the interpretations are usually far better in all respects (with the exception of No. 5).<br /><br />But if you just want the best box with the complete symphonies of Gustav Mahler, I would recommend Rafael Kubelik's set (DG collectors series) as the first choice. Kubelik's interpretations are far more balanced and presented without mannerism, and, overall, his set is more consistent than any of Bernstein's. For reference, you could then add the selected gems of Bernstein's early Mahler recordings: Nos. 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.<br /><br />Thus I give two stars for this DG set, three stars for the earlier CBS/SONY set, and four stars for Kubelik's set.
B00007AJF9|2.0|As Elizabeth I, Cate Blanchett is, of course, extraordinary. As a visual extravaganza, the film is lush and dramatic.  And yet, the overall effect is rather wearying.  The director uses a pretty heavy hand, especially when it comes to the score. He also manages to make the drama of Elizabeth's early life, which hardly needs any embellishment, seem unlikely.  I don't mind loose treatment of factual events if used in service to the story, but this film was loose in tone, so that it was hard to believe that these were Elizabethan men and women, rather than actors in rich costumes.  This is filmmaking as music video instead of filmmaking as storytelling.
B00008F23X|4.0|Caveat - I never studied the case upon which this flick was allegedly based, aside from seeing an entry about it in a copy of \\"Ripley's Believe it or not!\\", so I can't comment on its accuracy.  However, this flick grabbed me nonetheless.  DB Sweeny is Walton, a starry eyed dreamer in what looks like the woods of wild America.  He suffers a strange relationship with those he considers his friends, so that when he \\"disappears\\", they are suspected of murder.  Travis's friends are implicated in his disappearance, and begin to wonder whether, despite their certainty in their story, whether they might somehow be guilty for his loss.  Instead, Travis reappears with no concious memory of the lost time.  He undergoes hypnosis and recalls a traumatic sojourn aboard an alien craft.  At this point, the flick is forced to leave the promising plot-line that pitted Travis with his friends with that of whether his illusions are genuine memories (the film presents them so lucidly, it's impossible to believe the film disbelieves them).  \\"Fire\\" bravely plays up the alien menace of these abducting aliens - eschewing the stereotype of abduction as an enlightening evolution.  Instead of an intergalactic peace corps, these guys look like CIA freelancers.  The interiors of the ship look more like they were inspired by the darkness of the 90's than the bright and optimistic 70's that gave us the abduction craze to begin with.  DB Sweeny and Rob Patrick give effective performances in a story that measures its thin supply of shocks.  Definately watch-worthy.

B00005JMYI|4.0|I'll be honest, I don't go to the theater nearly as much as I used to.  And I go see comedies in the theater less than anything else.  So it is with great pleasure that I say that \\"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy\\" starring the great Will Ferrell is by far one of the funniest films I've seen in the past few years, funnier than even Ferrell's other onscreen classic, \\"Old School\\".<br /><br />The clothes and the attitude are dead-on parodies of the 70s.  Steve Carrell as the dopey news weatherman who declares, \\"I love rug, I love lamp\\" when asked if he had ever actually been in love is off the wall hilarious.  The scene with the septor has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Christina Applegate is the only one in over her head here.  She's given a fairly thankless \\"straight-woman\\" role and does nothing more than read her lines and look attractive, but I doubt anyone else could have done much with the role.<br /><br />All in all, the jokes come fast and often, with the unrated special edition of the DVD (said to include enough material for a whole other film) surely to add more to this.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKTF|3.0|This is a crude story filled with ambitious and fineness handle camera . The photography is exquisite , the arresting images : specially this turn around the train is unforgettable but the entire script doesn't have punch . It is well told but you feel the absence of greatness . May be is the stylish documentary storytelling and the not succesfully developed sense of the drama what it strikes the film . But Gillian Armstring knows as all of we there are been so many stories about the tragedies of the war where the sense of heroism , betrayal, fatality and injustice are fundamental factors of the war . In that sense Armstrong focuses her attention much more in the dramatis personae experienced by Charlotte Gray that in the environment which surrounds her .<br /><br />The Gray chase in the house lacks credibility . Do you really expect it is so easy to get out and escape from the Gestapo with a simple gun ? .<br /><br />The dramatic device employed for Armstrong when the train is leaving and her efforts for writting a letter seem a filled tear handkerchief thrown to the great audience .<br /><br />But the splendid perfomance of Cate Blanchet (one of the best twelve actress in the world to date) and a worthable cast saves the film being a positive point .<br /><br />One of the most emblematic paradoxs in the film is you can find your expected love in the middle of the hell.<br /><br />The most remarkable acting after Blanchet is obviously Billy Crudup as Julien Lavarde .<br /><br />But the film will not remain in your memory . You and me will forget very soon . And that it may be a weakness syntom of the film itself.
0553260111|4.0|This was an interesting book. It had a good premise and alot of plot twists. I'm impressed by the way Mr Ludlum can take even the most anticipated plot twist and have the characters not follow through the way I thought they would. It was a great concept (amnesia) and it kept me guessing (sometimes I was right, sometimes wrong) all of the time. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book as a starter to Ludlum's novels. There's action, interesting concepts and characters and, of course, the obligatory love interest. Definitely a fun book to read. I'll be reading the rest of the trilogy soon!
B00005JLEJ|5.0|This unbeatable Cannes winner film is a notable artistic triumph a real feast for the eyes , the mind and soul .<br /><br />When the King has died in a very undesirable moment -wartimes- the  Counsel decides not inform about this tragic event and decides to design a substitute for him to avoid the discouragement in the soldiers . The emotional tribulations and the huge pressure exerted in this double carries to a superb and poetic story teller under the powerful gaze of the superb japanese filmmaker, the dazzling genius : Akira Kurosawa .<br /><br />The arresting images in the final battle are simply outstanding .<br /><br />A timeless monumental masterpiece and one of the giants films in any age .
B00005JM0B|4.0|I've set my standards a little lower for Terminator 3. After all, it's not a James Cameron film. But boy, was I surprised upon viewing the DVD (and watching it after the first two). It finishes the Terminator trilogy quite neatly with its logical and satisfying conclusion. The movie moves briskly, there are no boring moments, kudos to Jonathan Mostow whose quick pacing has been honed in equally watchable movies like U-571 and Breakdown. Get this disc for the jaw-dropping chase scene across downtown L.A. involving a crane, fire truck, police vehicles and a pick-up.  Simply spectacular! Finding out how they did it in through the commentary is worth the retail price. The other disc is okay to have, but doesn't contribute much to the story or the Terminator mythology.
B000007O9L|4.0|Nice to hear something a little different.  I think the song selection fits the format and the sound is really good.  Why not jump on the \\"unplugged\\" band wagon.
B000068FXR|5.0|This is their 4th release, from 1975. It's not my favorite Supertramp albums (my fave is Even in the Quietest Moments) but it's still a near-masterpiece. The vocals and instrumentation sound magnificent on this digitally remastered release. Ken Scott was an incredible producer and this CD deserves to be listened to with headphones to truly appreciate all its nuances. Unfortunately this re-issue doesn't contain any additional tracks or liner notes but it's still well worth replacing your original copy due to its impeccable sound. Favorite songs are the minor hit, \\"Sister Moonshine\\" and the ambitious \\"Another Man's Woman\\". Hodson and Davies made great music & I wish they would get back together.
B000002G87|5.0|This is by far Clapton's best.  Duane Allman's slide guitar and contribution is unimaginable.  The emotion can be felt in every song, through every guitar note, and with one great band of musicians.  Clapton's love and lust for George Harrison's wife clearly provided this song writer/guitar player with all the necessary reasons to complete his finest release ever.  Still stands the test of time and is one of my all time favorite cd's.
0800125789|4.0|this movie was under appreciated <br /> <br />it's a hilarious motion picture <br /> <br />arnold schwarzenegger played the part perfectly <br /> <br />it's making fun of a typical action style movie and that's what makes it so hilarious <br /> <br />if you want to see a movie appropriate for all ages that will make you laugh over and over again get this movie! <br /> <br />it should be part of everyones collection
B000002JSP|4.0|John Paul Jones gets a lot of the credit here for pulling together a fine release.  Bonham's last pounding of the drums.  Plant upon losing a child with a heart felt emotional \\"Tears in Heaven\\" like \\"All of My Love\\" and Page providing the guitar licks that roll along with his previous material.  This is a great cd and the \\"last\\" studio release prior to the death of drummer John Bonham.
B00000I07R|4.0|I found this CD used for $3.00, and a guy that liked a bunch of music that I liked had called this one of the greatest CD's ever. I also liked the hits from \\"Slippery\\" (those are the only Jovi songs that they play on the radio) so I figured that I would give this a try. Even without hearing any of the songs before I could tell which ones were the singles, and while they were decent (except for \\"Bed of Roses,\\" which is almost as nausiating as Aerosmith's \\"Angel\\"), most of the rest of the album seems like it was thrown together quickly. Notice I said most, because there is one song called \\"Dry Country\\" which is the best song that Jovi has ever done. It is a staggering 9:23 long, yet seems like two or three minutes. While certain lyrics could have used some work (First he says that he needs oil, then he's praying for rain), overall it is really good; the highlight of the song being the 2:00 long solo by Sambora (that's not a typo, it's really two minutes). I just wish that the producer had made his guitar parts more audible above the rhythm section, but with all those complants, the solo and song are still REALLY good. You might be disappointed if you buy this for full priced, but if you see this new or used for under ten dollars, pick it up.
B000002J03|5.0|A classic release.  Page, Plant, and band took all the riffs out of \\"Dazed and Confused\\" on stage and basically completed this release while touring.  While the skeptics were still picking and panning the 1st release, this 2nd release blew them all away and stapled this band as a legendary classic.
B00012BD0S|2.0|I had heard so much hype about Symphony X and that this was their breakthrough (and arguably best) album. I was even willing to fork out $17.00 for a CD with only ten songs on it. Yet I was surprisingly disappointed. The idea of a guitar virtuoso (Michael Romeo) playing heavy metal mixed with symphonic influences sounds great on paper, but here it is a waste of money. The vocalist is not that good and the keyboards sound terrible. The rhythm guitar does not go well with the songs either. Romeo's solos, while full of complicated and speedy sections, do not add anything to the songs and it seems as if he is using them merely to show off how talented he is. (Even the 20-plus minute final track is boring). He does succeed, because it is obvious that he is very skilled. Probably the biggest fault lies in the lyrics, which are about cheesy fantasy crap that seems to be the norm for all power metal bands, talking about things like witches and monsters and other nerd crap. I'm debating whether to pick up their new CD \\"The Odyssey\\" and hopefully it will not be as big of a letdown.
B000002J0B|4.0|Often I hear how this is Zep at its best.  I disagree.  Maybe at that highpoint \\"career\\" level, following the success of Zep 4, I find Plant's voice \\"whiney\\"...does anyone else agree?  Although the staple of song gems continue, and don't get me wrong, I enjoy this release, I just don't think it's the better album in Zep's catelog.  I prefer the \\"live\\" version of the \\"Song Remains the Same\\" and I guess I am sick of hearing \\"D'yer Maker\\" on the radio...but with all that said, a fine cd.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I actually bought this CD a while ago. at first i didn't know if i really liked it or not. i have come to a conclusion and have decided i really, really, really, really, really love it! as a matter of fact, i'm listening to it right now. the reviews are out of 5.  <br /> <br /> <br />1. American Idiot-5  <br />Awesome! the best one on the CD.  <br /> <br />2. Jesus of Suburbia-4  <br />Cool! it just keeps going, but it is a very good thing that it is very up beat.  <br /> <br />3. Holiday-5  <br />So awesome with a very good beat and powerful lyrics, and i totally agree!  <br /> <br />4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams-5  <br />Kinda slow but one of my favorites!  <br /> <br />5. Are We the Waiting-4  <br />Cool!  <br /> <br />6. St. Jimmy-4  <br />Awesome. it just picks up really fast and stays w/ it the whole way.  <br /> <br />7. Give me Novacaine-3 3/4  <br />Just under 4. i don't know why.  <br /> <br />8. She's a Rebel-4  <br />Just awesome. that is all i can say.  <br /> <br />9. Extraordinary Girl-4  <br />Funky! :) (sorry, i'm running out of phrases. LOL!)  <br /> <br />10. Letterbomb-4 1/2  <br />Not quite a 5, and i like the beginning.  <br /> <br />11. Wake Me Up When September Ends-5  <br />Slow but Cool! i love this song.  <br /> <br />12. Homecoming-3 1/2  <br />just cause i haven't really listened to this one that much in depth yet.  <br /> <br />13. Whatsername-5  <br />Awesome. another one of my favorites!  <br /> <br /> <br />well there you have it. i hope i helped! also sorry this was so long. :)  <br /> <br />
B000002J09|5.0|This is, in my opionion, the best album release of all time.  I know there is a ton a fair competition out there of course but this release tends to stand the test of time.  Hard to call it \\"Zep's Best\\", most of the album releases are obvious classics.  This is a must have and I assumed most had this Zep release already.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Why would you want to subject yourself to this film more than once?  Aside from the fact that at one point Jesus and Pilate are speaking to each other in different languages (a point where I actually laughed out loud), there is almost zero biblical significance in this film.  Rather than take it's \\"accuracy\\" from the Bible, as Gibson claims, the Passion takes most of its content from the passion-plays of the Dark Ages.  Wanna know why it's called \\"the Passion\\"?  It isn't because Jesus was such a great guy; no, the \\"passion\\" of the title originally referred to the overwhelming emotion of the Jews in their persecution of him.  See, in the theology of the Dark Ages, passion and the emotions (yes, even love) were considered bestial and base aspects of humanity, and it was these \\"passions\\" (of the Pharisees and Jews) directed against Jesus during his trial that were blamed for the crucifixion and gave the piece it's title. <br /> <br />Note: I'm referring to the theology of the Dark Ages; I'm not calling Mel Gibson anti-Semitic.  But the piece has those underlying messages; orginally, \\"The Passion\\" was meant specifically to incite anti-Semitism, and since Gibson has used those Middle Age performances as his largest source, these messages are still there. <br /> <br />Think I'm lying?  Read your gospels; there's about, oh, twenty or so sentences total about the death of Christ.  The four gospels don't even agree on what his last words were.  Also, you'll see a reference to the Veil of Veronica in the film as well, a Christian artifact that, like the Holy Grail, has yet to be found and therefore has no \\"factual\\" basis.  Speaking of \\"fact\\", Aramaic's been a dead language for over a thousand years; no one's ever heard it spoken.  Gibson's interpretation of that language is therefore highly suspect and guesswork at best. <br /> <br />Honestly, this was one of the worst films I've ever seen.  I'd rather watch Mystery Science Theater (or any of the flicks they watch in MysteryScience Theater, for that matter) than see this piece of rubbish again.  Be Christian, that's cool and all; that's not what bothers me.  What bothers me is when Christians (to paraphrase the South Park boys) start focusing on how Jesus died and not on how he lived.
B000002B35|4.0|This is a great \\"post Waters\\" live release.  The concert captures David Gilmour at his best vocally and has a nice run of the \\"Darkside of the Moon\\" album.  An overall great sounding cd.
B00005JNEI|1.0|A cleverly-made piece of false propaganda that reminds me of the Communists throwing leaflets from airplanes.  Put together with bits and pieces of things taken completely out of context and filled in with loads of misinformation and out-and-out lies.  The movie itself is somewhat entertaining as long as you go into knowing that it is fictional.  It was like watching a skit on \\"Saturday Night Live\\".  Worth renting, but definitely not worth buying.  No wonder this clown got booed off the stage at the Oscars.
B000002OZY|4.0|Classic Who.  This is the blue print for rock opera.  This release really launched the Who and Pete T. into \\"supergroup\\" status.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban has a one-of-a-kind voice that everyone should hear. <br />His voice is rich and real, not a by-product of the studio enhancement. And his voice is just the same in person as it is at his concerts. His songs are a bit fluffy but still wonderfully written and sung. I especially love the songs in French, Italian and Spanish.  You don't have to speak the language to understand the emotion behind every song.  My fourteen year old daughter thinks he is wonderful, too. Believe me that says a lot. If she can listen to Josh everytime we are in the car instead of Beyonce, Jesse McCartney or Ashleigh Simpson then Josh has a long and fruitful career ahead of him.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I'm normally not one for musicals, but CHICAGO is a must-see.  It steps (literally in some scenes) outside itself often enough to remind the viewer that he or she is implicated in the show-biz aspect of criminal justice as deeply as the system itself (see NATURAL BORN KILLERS for further reference).  It's brash, but that is precisely its motivation.  It's loud, garish and contrived.  It has to be - - not only because it's scripted but in order to untrivialize its theme while showing how it has been trivialized.  That Renee Zellweger as murderess Roxie Hart is made to look like Madeline Kahn made to look like Marilynn Monroe is telling enough.  There are a lot of great scenes, my personal fave being the climactic courtroom scene late into the film wherein Richard Gere's character verbally tapdances his way to his client's acquital; the interspliced tapdancing bits of Gere himself are both hilarious and perfectly spot-on.  (Rob Marshall is a choreographic genius.)  I won't give away the ending, but the origin of the putative journal which decides Roxie's fate is both obvious in hindsight and perfectly scandalous.  Good singin', good playin', good (tap)dancin'.  It's all show-biz, kids.
B000003TA4|1.0|First off, I really don't like this album. It's sad that classics like Saimese Dream, Ritual De Lo Habitual, and Dirt get tossed away and crap like Nevermind gets put in as \\"The album that started it all.\\" <br /> <br />This album just started the downfall of what was music. <br /> <br />Now, as for the people who actually took AvrilFan serious, congratulations, you're a f*cking dolt. If you couldn't see the sarcasm or satire in the review, you should give yourself a pat on the back for being so stupid. Just look at the other reviews the fan made. It's quite clear, QUITE EXPLICIT, that it's all a joke.  <br /> <br />Stop bitching about the avrilfan and start questioning why you were trying to sound civilized when it came to someone pulling your string. <br /> <br />
B00005JMAH|3.0|I am another real fan of the Harry Potter series that felt the Charm of the books has been tainted by movie imagery shrouded in the dismal and the dank.  This is a colorless, depressing interpretation, with very little of the warmth and humor so captivating in the books.  While Cuaron may be an interesting and skilled director, he has missed the mark with this movie.  It is too caught up in the trendy, and preoccupied with the way it looks. It's trying way too hard to be cutting-edge cool.....too cool for uniforms, tool cool for English traditions, too cool to keep any of the first to films sets, too cool for any light-hearted humor,  too cool for any of the character interaction that makes the story fun.  If he wanted to make another horror genre film, he should have done so somewhere else and not hoisted these morose surroundings around this Harry Potter film.  Granted, Rowling's storyline becomes gradually more foreboding, but this level of darkness is premature and does not evolve until the 5th or 6th book/installment.  This is such a drastically different approach than the previous 2 films, that they don't even seem connected at all.   <br /> <br />And Cuaron misses so much of the lush details of the Prisoner of Azkaban book!  There are so many things left unexplained, so many untapped actors left on the sidelines, so much charm that could have been imbued into this story!  His rush to get through this film is a missed opportunity and has left the Harry Potter fans unfulfilled.  This is not the kind of movie you could watch over and over.  There is just not enough content or detail. <br /> <br />I WILL say that the casting and acting is undeniably superb!  The music is just marvelous! The sets are extremely well crafted, and special effects are also quite good.  But it's \\"too much show, and not enough go\\", as they say.  For Harry Potter fans, it will not hold up to the test of time. <br /> <br />
1400032717|5.0|After teaching for several years I have come across my share of autistic students.  Like all students they have their idiosyncracies, from the mild to the extreme.  Nicholas understands maths, dogs, patterns, the impact of colors on his moods and why he would be happier in a solitary world.  He does not understand most human emotion, whether it is one drawn on a smiley face or it is one that drives someone to murder his neighbor's dog.  This murder sets into motion an investigation of sorts led by Nicholas, who is a fan of Sherlock Holmes.  As he solves the case he is exposed to a larger physical and emotional world, takes risks, and survives into some degree of maturity and personal strength.   <br /> <br />This is an excellent book, interesting, well-written by someone who obviously knows the joys and frustrations of working with people with autism.  There is never a patronising tone toward Christopher.  Nor is there a negative tone taken toward his parents when they reach their limits with some of his behaviors.  All of the characters are written as all too human, flawed and frail, weak and wonderful, merciful and sometimes, capable of bad things.  Nicholas finds out he is capable of much more than he ever thought, and we are along for this journey of discovery.
6305897786|4.0|The editors review above seemed positive, but then he ended by saying it's always on the verge of being interesting-I think what he meant was on the verge of thrilling, but never really goes there. This really is an excellent film, and continues to rank among my all time favorites.(Some of which are- Runaway Jury, Terminator, Windtalkers.)It sort of has the look and feel of a classic Hitchcock. An excellent cast and I think Johnny Depp's best role, although many would say \\"Donnie Brasco\\" was.  4 1/2 stars for \\"The Ninth Gate.\\"
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This has to be 1 of the best albums i have ever bought! It is different from most music. There is not one single track i could say tht i didnt like so im not goin to even try naming bad tracks! However my favourite track has to be michael! Until i saw franz ferdinand live i never thought i could like them any more but wow! these guys are really amazin live it has to be the best gig i have ever been to! I like the way the band have put their friends experiances into the tracks to make them tht bit more personal! This cd consisting of 11 tracks is amazin and absoultly well worth ure money!
B000002H2H|5.0|The truth is that metallica's \\"ride the lightning\\" is a masterpiece and a metal classic that any one-- into thrash or any kind of metal, should praise and regonize where the true essences of pure, american, thrash-metal came from and if you do not  like ride the lightning? Your either mentally challenge or your a huge poser that don't deserve to listing to metal...Now slayer is a band that  has talent musicians and all their albums are thrash metal classics, i know that because i grew up listining to thrash bands and i've met the guys from Metallica,slayer,kreator,deathangel and i've played cover songs by those bands AND if you do not regonize slayer as,  old school thrashmetal masters? Your either an idiot or need to commit suicide! Anyways, it's pointless to fight about who's thrash or who's not because the truth the matter is that both slayer and metallica are godfathers of thrash along with deathangel,kreator,sodom,testament,sepultura (early albums) and both of you need to realize that and stop fighting like two little girls in a metallica board. I think both of you are the same person  but you're bored that's why you want to fight with your self. The bottom line is that, im a huge fan of 80's thrash and again both slayer and metallica deserve credit for giving us pure brutal and beautifull thrash solos that made us who we are today--metalheads. The difirence between both sounds? Is that slayer didn't have many melodis but just  brutal assult and guitar solos but no melodis as in metallica? Had beautifull melodis as well as a sound that's, every thrash metal's anthem. I don't see the point of saying who's thrash or whos not because they both were and both need to get credit for making the best music ever!  \\"ride the lightining\\" is without a doubt... A masterpiece.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer may have put a little punk vibe into their music but heck \\"anthrax\\" made a song with rappers...Thats even worse. I can safely say that \\"reign in blood\\" is a thrash classic and the lirycs are intelligent and well put together. I don't see how some people into thrash can't get into this masterpiece and it just doesn't make any sense to me. All hail slayer!
B0001CCXY8|1.0|I know that cannibal corpse have always released albums and put their best effort into making them, but the music played here? Is very mediocre,repetative,weak production and for a deathmetal band that should be respected? Thats awfull. I dont see any difirence since Chris left and now because its basically the same sound and their try to be technical and like they are actullie talented players? All i can say is that, they failed  very badly at it. If your thinking about buying cannibal corpse's \\"wretched spawn\\" i would recommend insted ? You get albums by these bands, Dyinfetus,morbid angel,kataklysm,behemoth,amon amarth,at the gates,grave,death,obituary,and,circle of dead children, cephalic-carnage,exhumed,scar-culture,commit-suicide,and a few others that are respected and have talent...Unlike, cannibal corpse!
078401213X|5.0|Pi is an incredible film to which I give the highest marks.  Aronofsky's rhythmic style adds color to this black and white masterpiece.  Max Cohen (clearly a Jewish character) is your normal, run-of-the-mill eccentric mathematician with intolerable headaches that force him to pop pills regularly.  He is searching for a number buried in Pi (3.1415927...) which may help to make order of chaos through forecasting the stock market.  But Wall Steet is not the only organization after Max's expertise.  A group of religious Jews immersed dangerously far in Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) are hoping he might unlock the Lord's true name and make way for the Messianic age.  Unfortunately for Max, as many masters of Jewish thought warn, dabbling in the secrets of Kabbalah can have irreparable effects on one's psyche, and his can take only so much.  Don't watch the end if power drills make you uncomfortable.
B0002OERI0|4.0|...one of my daughters likes rap and techno; the other likes emo. Some of my (former) students have shared CDs with me. I give it all a listen--I'm pretty open--and I end up using words like lifeless, soulless, abrasive, repetitive, whining (especially the emo), and corporate \\"product\\" to describe what I hear. The stuff they don't listen to--what ends up on the radio--is worth even less. If it sounds good, it's usually a ripoff of something done decades ago and now forgotten. So I bury myself in REALLY retro stuff from even before I was born.  I still ask--Where's something original? Something that relies on the old but transforms it into something brand new? Where's something that has a message beyond sex and self?  <br /> <br />Well, here it is. I'm fascinated with this album--I'm 60 and I'm supposed to be way past its demographic.  I actually sat down to listen to it--I haven't done that in a long time. I hear echoes of all kinds of things from the past 40 years, but it sounds totally 21st century; the lyrics--even if there's still a lot of suburban middle class whining here--are worth trying to decipher and think about. It's political in a very broad sense--and I'm VERY political. It has a wonderful driving punk rock energy and melodies that actually stick in the brain. So the music isn't entirely dead--yet. And I suspect this album could have appeal at least to some in my age group, if they'd give it a shot.
B0000020C4|5.0|If there is only one Les Mis cast to be assembled, this is definitely it.  Les Mis is one of the most-loved, if not the most-loved musical of all time, and this concert made the musical reach the apex of excellence.  Lea Salonga is the best Eponine there is despite some negative reactions from other reviewers who believe that Frances' quacking does justice to the character.  I bought the DVD for performances by Lea Salonga, Philip Quast, Michael Ball and Judy Kuhn.  I especially loved, next to 'On My Own', 'A Little Fall of Rain', that painful duet by Michael Ball and Lea Salonga. <br /> <br />And I would never ever forget that flute solo of 'Bring Him Home'... it will really touch your heart.  Bravo to the flutist. And bravo to the cast that swept the world!
0689859368|5.0|This book is very good! It is a fantasy book, very short but very good.  <br /> It is about three kids, Mallory-age-13, her brothers Simon and Jared-age-9(they are twins), and their mom. Their mom and dad are divorced. So they and their mom move from the city to the country. Their house was Their Great Aunt's house, but it is already a old house, like a victorian house.  And Jared finds something in the walls of the house.  And when he finds this thing some kind of animal keeps playing pranks on him.  What was thing they found?  What was playing pranks on them? Read the book and you will see! <br />     The book is very suppensful, I couldn't put it down!  If you like books that make you ask questions then you should read this book! <br />
B0000640VN|4.0|Kate and Leopold was a charming film. A bit of a fantasy and accidental romance. It was interesting and humorous as Meg Ryan falls for a time traveling inventor. A goofy sort of plot device, but the terriffic cast makes it work. The characters were seasoned and worked well together. It's a love story even a guy could sit through. It's what a film should be. It's good and light from beginning to end. Most anyone would like this film.
B0000584V3|5.0|This is Opeth's masterpiece album. Not one bad song. These guys make awesome acoustic and heavy music. But like the death metal growling better. I have only one complaint the songs are very long, but the music forgives that. Anyways awesome album you must get it if your a music fan. Best tracks are The Leper Affinity, Bleak(the best song), Dirge For November and the title track. Also check out every other Opeth album, all are great except Deliverance.. This is one of my favorite bands along with Otep, Lamb of God, Norma Jean and The Black Dahlia Murder. Be sure to check those band out too. Opeth rule!
B000002J03|5.0|I was never into  zeppelin's debut and some of their other albums didn't do for me but lz's second released album titled\\" Led zeppelin II\\" made me look at zeppelin,  in a difirent way and i still im not a fan and still  do not like most of their albums besides \\"led zeppelin III\\" which is also a amazing album.On zeppelin II?You will hear creativity,lirycs that are out of this world, guitar riffs so beautifully played and a vibe that is quite haunting. I highly recommend \\"led zeppelin II\\" to be added, in your collection!
B0002Y4TTC|4.0|Finally, the Mighty Bards have produced a DVD for their loyal fans.  I was extremely excited to see this concert video.  They passed by Denver on their first-ever US tour, so I was not able to see them live.  And . . . they included on this DVD \\"And Then There Was Silence\\", one of my favorite songs by them. <br /> <br />The picture and sound quality of Disc 1 are absolutely phenomenal.  With the exception of the short bagpipe part in the middle of \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\", everything is crystal clear.  (Not quite sure what happened there with the sound system, but it sounds like you are standing right next to Thomen's drum kit for about 10 seconds).  And of course, there are great interviews and extra songs on the second disc. <br /> <br />Comprising their shows over the two days of the first-ever Blind Guardian Festival in Germany, they took 20 songs from both nights.  There are the obvious ones - \\"Valhalla\\", \\"The Bard's Song\\", \\"Imaginations From The Other Side\\", and \\"Mirror Mirror\\".  They would get lynched if they didn't include those.  But there are a few cool surprises, too - the aforementioned \\"Silence\\" and \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\", as well as \\"And The Story Ends\\" and \\"I'm Alive\\".  And what an awesome experience it must be for the band to hear the crowd sing every note of their three ballads, \\"A Past And Future Secret\\", \\"Lord Of The Rings\\", and \\"The Bard's Song\\". <br /> <br />They really must be commended for their 14-minute beast, \\"And Then There Was Silence\\".  There is no way they could possibly reproduce what they did in the studio, short of having an orchestra, about 20 backup singers, and 5 or 6 more guitarists.  The sound is not nearly as dense as the studio version, and Hansi certainly can't sing every layered part.  But as they mention in the Disc 2 interview, there is so much going on with this song, that any slip-up or problem in concert would turn it into a disaster.  And I think they nail it pretty darn well. <br /> <br />A couple small complaints.  Thecameras often give stacatto, machine-gun shots, firing split-second frame after split-second frame.  I would like to see more of the longer frames, for more of a true live feel.  The cameras also don't show Thomen enough.  I enjoy seeing a drummer of his incredible talent ply his trade in concert.  As an example, Iron Maiden's \\"Maiden England\\" concert video does a geat job of showcasing Nicko's talent.  I also don't think they show the \\"temporary help\\" enough - bassist Oliver Holzvarth and keyboardist Michael Schuren.  Holzvarth especially, since he has essentially taken over Hansi's bass duties. <br /> <br />Overall, though, this is one incredible DVD, and every Blind Guardian fan should not be without it.  Watching them live has proven to me once again that this is, by far, one of the most talented bands out there - musically, lyrically, structurally, and topically.  They deliver mind-blowing time changes, starts/stops, melodies, and discordant rhythms, all at speeds that make your head spin.  Thomen, especially, should receive much praise.  He handles the tempo changes and crazy beat structures incredibly well while still keeping perfect time.  Andre hits every note with his lead guitar, and Marcus races through the background rhythms nicely.  And even though he is not the consummate frontman (in fact, he actually seems a bit intimidated in the first 3 or 4 songs), Hansi belts out his lyrics with conviction and an incredible set of pipes.
B000002P5R|5.0|When i talk about who's one of the most talent people that plays the guitar in the 60's like no one person ? Jimi hendrix comes to mind. I mean sure he's music was for hippis back in the 60's and that kinda turns me off, alot, but still you can't take away the fact that his melodis,soul,musicianship is truly overwellmean. Jimi hendrix's \\"first rays of the new rising sun\\" is my favorite album by the band and still remains my most listing record, todate.

0446310786|4.0|This controversial book, published in the 1940s, is about a black man brought to trial under the crime of raping a white woman. The setting is in a small town in Alabama called Maycomb County. The main characters are Atticus Finch, a lawyer, Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, and Jem Finch.  Scout and Jem , Atticus's two young children, start out as ages 6 and 10 at the beginning of the book, slowly growing older as the book progresses. In the first half, Jem, Scout and their friend Dill have small adventures during the summers when Dill visits. Dill has a fascination with Boo Radley, a neighbor of the Finch's. He lives in a house with his brother and never comes out, to the town's knowledge. The trio tries several times to make him come outside with no success. Eventually they move on to other things.  <br /> In the middle of the book, the trial comes around and Atticus Finch is selected to defend Tom Robinson, the accused black man. Scout learns what a \\"n_____-lover\\" is after repeatedly hearing herself and her father called one. The first time a young boy calls her a n_____-lover at school, she promptly starts a fight with him, even though she hadn't known  the definition of it yet. After a stern lecture from her father, she promises not to fight with anyone ever again. She breaks that promise when she goes to her aunt's house on Thanksgiving and is taunted by her second cousin. Atticus faces problems around town before the trial. Mobs seek to hurt him while Atticus is guarding Tom's jail cell door late at night. The group of angry men recede after Scout, Jem and Dill come running up to Atticus and Scout has a friendly, somewhat one-sided converation with Mr. Cunningham, one of the men in the mob.  <br /> I enjoyed this book because it portrayed the image of what the black people had to go through in the South, even after the Civil War and slavery had long passed. They were always second-rate and treated very poorly. I would recommend this book to any middle school to high school student. <br />
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|this is a great cd.  GhettoDragon you are stupid for saying its dissappointing and giving it 2 stars. and all you other people that said this cd sucks go get a kidz bop cd because you suck just like the little kids on that cd.
B00006L90T|4.0|The opening credits of CARNIVAL OF SOULS appear on the screen across a turbulent body of water. This symbolic image is augmented by a haunting score of organ music.  Then the action begins.  Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is the passenger in a vehicle with some female friends.  A car full of boys challenges the girls to a drag race through the country and it's off to the races. The speeding chase comes to an end when the girls' care accidently swerves off the bridge into the rushing, high-water river below. Hours later as the river is dragged and witnesses are question, Mary climbs out of the river. She is covered in mud, scraped up a little, and chilled from the water. She is alive, but the accident has wiped away her memory of how she escaped.<br /><br />A week later, Mary moves away from her hometown and begins a cross-country drive to Salt Lake City, Utah where she has accepted a job as an organist in a small church.  During the drive, she is almost involved in another accident as she sees the face of a pale, death-like man appear in her window. She also becomes strangely intrigued by a closed Carnival Pavillion on the outskirts of the city. Mary soon settles into her new life, but begins seeing the pale man more frequently. She becomes obsessed with the closed and condemned carnival building outside of town and like the frightening man, the carnival begins to haunt her sleeping dreams and waking thoughts. Soon Mary experiences a phenomena where she cannot hear any sounds except the ones she makes and where other people seem oblivious to her prescence.  Mary is an excellent organist, an attractive woman, and a colorful individual but she is told by the preacher at her church, the neighbor next door who lusts after her body, and a counselor who listens to her problems that she seems to have lost her soul.  As the organ music picks up tempo, Mary's life snowballs out of control leading to a horrifying confrontation and bitter realization at the Carnival.<br /><br />CARNVIAL OF SOULS was released in 1962 and was made on a shoe-string budget.  Along with the later 1968 film, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, CARNIVAL OF SOULS established the framework and set the foundation for the modern day horror movie.  Most of the acting in the movie is standard for a low-budget scary movie, though Hilligoss' performance stands out as a rare exception.  Hilligoss had some talent and it would have been interesting to see her in more movies (she only acted in one other movie besides CARNIVAL OF SOULS). The sets are scenery are pretty standard fare and nowadays the plot has been overly done, though in 1962 it was a fairly fresh and original idea.  Besides Hilligoss' acting and a few starkly vivid images, the other standout component of the movie is the score.  Organ music usually doesn't work very well as a movie score, especially in scary movies. However, the music in CARNIVAL OF SOULS is a key element in establishing the mood and tone of the movie. It's something to remember and like those catchy little advertisement jingles, can haunt one's musical memory for days.<br /><br />Not everyone will enjoy CARNIVAL OF SOULS and many will find it quite cheesy today. Nevertheless, for movie and horror buffs, the film is worth watching for its cinematic legacy and cult appeal.<br />CARNVIAL OF SOULS was released in 1962 and was made on a shoe-string budget.

B00028HBKM|3.0|How could anyone sit there and watch so much suffering and violence? We still have restrictions on seeing genital sex in main line movies. Why was so much laceration of the body, the terrible beatings and so on allowed and even praised by so many monvie goers and Christians? This is not about the historical Jesus which I have studied. This is melodrama. I found it hard to believe and recognized the gobs of body paint on the actor. This actor lacks strength and character so it was not believable that he was taking so much violence. The point of Jesus' suffering on the cross was that he had character and consciousness not to focus on the suffering happening to his body or the ending of his existence, but to refuse being drugged with wine and to give ultimate focus to his betrayal by those around him and by God, as when he says his last lines, My God, My God why have you utterly betrayed me? And dies. The Passion of Mel Gibson lacks the development of character of Jesus and so this renders the ending violence unbelievable. We have lost our sense of reality when we get caught up in images and lose sight of the character of a person. If you want to see the pornography of violence but without the real Jesus of history, then you can buy the video. I know something of what I am talking about from thrity-five years now working with the historical Jesus material and practicing living the teachings in my own life though I am in no sense a Christian. You won't find the real Jesus in this film. It is a good lesson in what not to do. Don't let yourself be taken in by the visuals or the melodramatic acting. Making money is not the goal of living a spiritual life.

B00005JM02|5.0|MY THREE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER LOVES THIS MOVIE, SHE'S ALL ABOUT NEMO. I ALSO ENJOYED THIS MOVIE EVEN THOUGH IT'S A CARTOON AND DISNEY. I REALLY AM NOT A BIG DISNEY FAN BECAUSE THE CARTOONS ALWAYS HAVE PRETTY WHITE PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY DO HAVE PEOPLE OF OTHER RACES THEY  JUST LOOK LIKE WHITE PEOPLE WITH TANS,BUT THIS MOVIE WAS UNIVERSE AND FUNNY AND WARM. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE IT'S TOUCHING AND HUMOROUS.
B00009P1O2|5.0|My title should say enough about how I feel about this DVD, but in case it doesn't, I'll elaborate...   Filmed July 12, 1986 at Wembley Stadium in London, this concert was a sold out show. In fact, there was only supposed to be one show (July 12), but they added a second one in response to the crazy amount of fans. (You can hear all of this on the bonus DVD included.) The atmosphere is set, the 70,000+ fans are clapping for the band to come out. Suddenly, the deafening roar of Brian May's guitar blasts the audience's ears. Freddie strolls out on stage with white jeans and an awesome yellow leather jacket. \\"One Vision\\" is  in full production now. The drums start up, the bass plinks on, the show has started!   I'm not going to go through the whole damn show (it's virtually impossible), but I will give an overview.   \\"Basically, blind and deafen them in the beginning, take it down, do a medley or whatever, then bring it to another climax at the end.\\" -Brian May (interview on the DVD) A perfect way to describe this concert. \\"Tie your mother Down\\" and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" are definitely big climaxes of the shows.    Okay, I'm going to talk about some of the truly great. \\"Love of my Life\\" is a true highlight. Hearing all those die-hard fans singing the song (not singning along- Freddie shoves the mic out to the people), then getting a bow from their favorite performer sends the hairs on the back of my neck straight up. The \\"Impromptu\\" is, for lack of better words, ethereal. If anyone has ever heard a human manipulate their voice to such heights (Robert Smith of The Cure comes close, but still...), please let me know. This man... God he gets his voice to the pitch where only dogs can hear it! The guitar solo in the middle needs to be appreciated. Now, when I first watched this, I hit my skip button. But, once I had watched most of the DVD I went back. Brian May is one of the most uderrated guitarists out there, yesterday or today. I was mesmirized watching him.   It was also great to see the band do some songs that weren't their own. Many people criticize them but I think it's great. In an interview, Brian said these were the songs the group used to listen to when they first started out. \\"Tutti Frutti\\" is awesome!   The second disc has so many bonuses I'm not sure I can get through them all. There's interviews, backstage footage, a documentary, and much more. To think this 2-disc set is under [$$] is outrageous!    Well, by now you should have an idea of what this DVD has to offer. If you only buy one DVD of Queen, I would suggest this one! (We Will Rock You is just as awesome) BUY THIS!
0792839730|5.0|\\"A Bridge Too Far\\" is like \\"the Longest Day\\", but of the 1970's.  Incorperating great actors like Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Michael Caine, and Anthony Hopkins, plus a few others.    This picture is a very accurate and graphic look on Operation Market-Garden, a plan that horribly failed, of the 3 original objective bridges that were to be captured only one was held. Of the 10,000 British Paratroopers of the 1st Airborne who jumped into Holland, only 2000 men came out battle ready. The division sustained 80% casualties. Montgomery called the plan 90% complete when the battle was over. Of course he was 100% wrong. He was a good general fighting Rommel in Egypt, but his career would never get any higher than that.    At some points in the movie, scenes get a bit slow, but mostly it is about the Allied soldiers' lives in this little known operation.

B00005ASHM|5.0|I can clearly understand why this album was such an inspiration to Paul McCartney, leading him and the Beatles into the studio to put forth Sgt. Pepper. From the first track, to the last, each cut was superbly written and composed. This was, and remains, a Brian Wilson masterpiece.

B00005JLYW|1.0|Charlies angels comes back worser than ever. The plot...well sorry there is no plot! But I  no they have to go after a \\"ring\\". Like the first one the good guy turns bad except this time it isn't surprising at all. You know right from the start and the movie seems to continue on without you! No mystery, like the first and anxsious waiting to see what happens next. You don't really care and you just watch the movie, unlike the first one, which is much better. Yes, there are some cool actions scenes...the are a bit too many actions scenes which is probably why theres is so little, sorry, no plot at all. They try to add romance but it doesn't work and ends up leaving the film in a total disaster. If you like Charlies angels stick with the first movie, and if you like the fighting scenes in the first one dont get this one because it has no fighting. This movie gets...1.5 stars...

B00003XAQ5|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best jazz album ever made. Bill Evans sets the mood with those first few famous notes, and the rest is history. The line-up of musicians is incomperable, both in terms of talent and empathy. If you're serious about listening to jazz, begin your listening experience with this one. No collection worth its salt is without it! <br />Enjoy!
0689835604|4.0|This book is very cute and my daughter loves it.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that, like any flap book, the flaps are difficult for little fingers to lift and are not very sturdy.  Since my daughter likes it so much, it is coated with packaging tape to keep it together.  She is 1.5 yo now, and points to the baby's eyes and mouth, etc.  She also plays boo-boo (peek-a-boo) with the baby on the last page.  A very enjoyable book!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I find it depressing that most of the facts in this film are things the American media should have reported but ignored. How could the Taliban, who everyone knew was harboring bin Ladin, visit Bush in TX (just before the attacks in 2001) but not ONE SINGLE media source report it at the time? UNBELIEVABLE. This is just one little piece of a two hour roller coaster ride blasting the media and the current administration. I wish it had been 4 hours long instead of only 2!!! If you want to see something different than your average movie, buy this film. It will not disappoint!
0385512104|4.0|Mark Haddon is a brave author. To attempt a novel where the narrator is a 15 year old autistic boy with extremely limited emotional intelligence is a bold manouever. With such attempts, there is always the danger that the narrative will appear unrealistic or over sentimental.<br /><br />Haddon avoids these traps however. He makes the narrator, Christopher, a maths genius, exhibiting the 'little professor' symptoms that some aspergers children display. His extremely developed logical ability allows him to tell his story in a manner inspired by his favourite novel, The Hound of the Baskervills. In trying to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington- his neighbour's dog, he is able to train himself to think like a detective (ableit an innocent and unique one) without his adventures becomming bogged down in a malestrom of sensory overload.<br /><br />Haddon also has experience of working with autistic children, and describes the problems of Christopher's mind intelligently and sensitively. For example he has him play complex mathematical games in his head when the outside world gets too much and likens his brain to a computer which shuts down when it is unable to cope with the massive dose of sensory information that Christopher is faced with, his mind unable to selectively filter what information is essential like non autistic children. Haddon's portrayal seems realistic, although maybe at times  Christopher appears too much of a genius for a boy of his age and characteristics. It would be interesting to hear the opinions of an aspergers sufferer on Mark Haddon's fictional creation.<br /><br />The only reservation I have with the novel is the ending. It is nice, tidy and logical. Which ties in with Christopher's desire for order. But it has an artificial ring to it. For life in Christopher's case can never have a tidy conclusion, like the endings in detective novels. For his autism continues, and human relations are a constant struggle. I was left sensing that the main mystery - how Christopher will learn to cope as he enters adulthood, is yet to be solved.t the main mystery - how Christopher will learn to cope as he enters adulthood, is yet to be solved.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|There have been a few really great adaptations of King for the screen (\\"Misery\\" & \\"The Shining\\", to name a couple). Still, the two best, both about prisons and both written & directed by Frank Darabont have to be \\"The Green Mile\\" and \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\". Both were also nominated for Best Picture and Screenplay, but NOT director (another Oscar travesty). \\"Shawshank\\" was a slight novella by King, and Darabont turned it into a 142 minute narrative that never fails to draw the viewer in deeper with every frame. The new 2-disc DVD is fine, though the 2nd disc has some repetitive interviews. How Darabont managed to take the grim story about a seemingly hopeless bunch of individuals and turn it into a film of hope, renewal and conscience...as well as a good smattering of justice...still amazes me. I am not the least bit surprised that this is considered among the best screenplays of all time. Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, Gil Bellows and all the rest were perfect. The editing in particular was layered in a way where the very talky script never got tired. This is a film all should see, if only to know that if you have patience and keep your wits, anyone can survive the most dire circumstances. This is a wonderful film experience. ALL credit should go to Frank Darabont.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I was so thrilled when the Star Wars dvd's were announced that I pre-ordered them within a day of the announcement, even though I knew they would be the \\"special edition\\" versions of the films. Yes like many I am a purist and favor the original theatrical releases the best. I was, though, just happy to have a digital copy of the special edition films. After waiting nearly 8 months to receive the dvd set, I was shocked and horrorified,  to find the films have been changed yet again!     So what's different?     The smallest changes are in A New Hope, basically the added scene with Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt has be redone to look smoother.     In Empire Strikes Back, there is all new dialog between the Emperor and Darth Vader in the hologram chamber as well as a new image of the Emperor using Ian McDiarmid. Finally, gone is Boba Fetts original voice over, replaced with the voice of Temuera Morrison, who plays Jango Fett in the newer trilogy.     In Return of the Jedi there are some cosmetic changes at the final ceremony which now includes celebrations on Curascant and Naboo. The most significant change in ROTJ is as Luke looks into the forest and sees the spirits of Anakin, Yoda and Obi-wan the original actor playing Anakin has been digitally removed and replaced with Hayden Christensen!     Lucas says these changes were done for \\"constistency.\\" If it's constitent to have Boba Fett sound like Jango Fett, presumably because he's a clone, why do all the stormtroopers, who are also clones, sounds different? As for the spirit scene, if it's more consistent to see the younger Anakin Skywalker spirit why didn't they digitally add Hayden to the scene where Luke removes Vaders helmet?    On top of the changes is an all new 5.1 surround sound audio track that lacks DTS Surround and has several glaring audio drop outs and incorrect signal placements.    The special features disc has an interesting documentary on the original trilogy and several other featurettes. People avoiding info on Episode 3 beware there are some major spoilers on the disc!    Ultimately if you are a serious fan of the original Star Wars trilogy you are likely to be disappointed with this set, as I was.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I work at a factory making DVD's and we are currently doing about a million of this one. I have finally finished watching the concert and all I can say is it has given me a new found appreciation for Evanescence and Amy Lee. She carries herself onstage like a pro. Her voice is flawless and so full of power it almost eclipses the studio album \\"Fallen.\\" If you were ever on the fence about embracing this band, buy this LIVE DVD/CD combo and you will be converted. When a band can play this well live, that usually means they will have some staying power. I guess that Best New Artist Grammy was well deserved. As long as the band does not self-destruct, as fans, we will be on the receiving end of fantastic performances like this. Bow down to Amy Lee...GODDESS!!
B000002505|3.0|A good album by Carlos and John (fellow Chinmoy followers at the time). The problem with the album is it is directionless and realy lacks the melody or the explosiveness of the other projects by these two at the time. <br /> <br />If you wan't a mellower jazzy feel to this claboration go for 'Welcome' by Santana with John which BTW has an excellent track titiled 'Love Devotion and Surrender'. Welcome is a far superior album with great tunes and classic fussion in 'Flame sky' where the guitar duel between Carlos and John is yet to be surpassed.  <br /> <br />If you like the fast and fussion side of the musicians then as a lot of the other reviewers have said go for 'Inner Mounting Flame' with The Mahavishnu Orchestra. <br /> <br />All in all this one was slightly disappointing  for me as I was hoping it would be similar to 'Welcome'.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I think I first watched this when I was 6 or 7, and it immediately became my favorite movie.  My dad used to read me the Oz books before I went to bed, and Ozma was my IDOL at 6, so it was really cool to seem her in it.  I also loved seeing Jack Pumpkinhead and Tiktok, and whenever I think of them to this day, I imagine thier Return to Oz selves.  The thing I liked most about it, though, was it's SCARINESS.  The Nome King freaked me out SO MUCH, and the talking rocks, and the whole hospital scene.  I loved it!  OTOH, my parents wouldn't let my younger sister watch it for years, which was definitely a good idea, because she was scared very easily at that age. <br /> <br />I finally got to watch it again with this DVD and I was so happy!  It's just as weird as I remember.  The costume design is my number 1 favorite thing about it now.  The Wheelers and Ozma and the changing-heads-lady, especially!  I noticed that the special effects were kinda hokey at times, sure, but it didn't detract from the whole experience too much, I don't think. <br /> <br />And no, Return to Oz doesn't follow either the books OR the first movie very closely.  But it's still very fun to watch!  I highly recommend it to parents of children who like scary movies -- it's freaky and wierd, but not gross or TOO frightening.  Lots of excitement for the whole family!
B000002UAF|5.0|This Album is Greatness!! and it gets looked over alot because of all their later releases, which is a shame because it's superb for early beatles. I mean c'mon. If i fell is one of the greatest stinkin songs ever. Alot of people think early Beatles were not as good as later when they \\"matured\\" a little more. Very wrong, i'm afraid. It sounds as fresh as the day it was made, and made me realize why this band is so great, which of course turned me to all their other albums which too are superb. Yet for some reason this album really catches me, and  i love it. Good at any time. Check it Out.
B0000028M7|5.0|This album is definitley Alice In Chains' greatest and is a great album overall.  It includes such hits as \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Angry Chair\\", and \\"Would?\\", but also includes non-singles which are worthy of talk-like \\"Dam That River\\".
0465043550|5.0|The (Mis)Behavior of Markets by Benoit Mandelbrot is a wonderfully written book which admirably assists in the further intellectual dismantling of the Efficient Market paradigm. There is nothing so empowering as having a brilliant pundit provide a scientific broadside which beautifully debunks the assumptions of a financial theory. Behavioral Finance proponents such as Kahneman and Tversky, Bob Shiller, Dick Thaler, Terry Odean et alia have already exposed flaws in the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The (Mis) Behavior of Markets is however, a mathematical attack on randomness. Mandelbrot repeatedly demonstrates that there are patterns and dependencies in price histories across all times and all scales. He provides a new way of looking at markets which he calls \\"Econophysics.\\" <br /> <br />The intersection between Mandelbrot and mainstream Behavioral Finance is that ultimately, they both analyze the choices of investors. Markets are, after all, only the result of the systemic cognitive errors of investors. These psychological patterns, as manifested in securities prices, are what Mandelbrot is mathematically analyzing. The investing heuristics of human beings are subsumed by his math. Of course, trading algorithms and trend following systems also attempt to mathematically reckon with systemic investor errors. In other words, his way is another way of parsing the, same old, same old, foibles of Mr. Market. The most important inference of the Behavioral Finance revolution is that humans make mistakes in markets. Mandelbrot's math will be wrong, we will be wrong, investors will be wrong. Markets will always be just as messy as the human habits which create them. But if we employ risk management, we can still prosper. The end of his book summarizes markets as: fractal, turbulent, risky, historically dependent, almost - cyclical, scalar, deceptive and both bubbly and jumpy. He surmises that the notion of \\"Value\\" is always relative. <br /> <br />I find it personally compelling that he points out that \\"fractals are supremely visual.\\" This has been a hallmark of my work for twenty years but I am no mathematician. His mathematical descriptions of hierarchies, repetition and scaling are mirrored in the \\"Stacked Fractals\\" and the \\"Trend Positioning System\\" presented in Behavioral Trading. He tells us that \\"economics is a science of fashions\\"- which sounds a lot like Memetics. Mandelbrot is famous for finding de-fined symmetrical scaling in the history of cotton prices. Do you remember the cotton market of 1887? Probably not. But, Mandelbrot math proves historical dependence in cotton prices. Thus, today's' cotton prices do remember (that is, depend on) 1887 market behavior! Investors may not cotton to market timing but cotton (Semiotics fractals) looks bullish in 2005. <br /> <br />Alas, the reader is still left pining for the holy grail of some sort of prediction equation. Indeed it seems we investors are always let down when we expect a perfect pitch. Perhaps we always will be dissatisfied. It may be our Cartesian conceit that we can conceptually capture the market on our own cognitive terms. Markets have patterns but they are not easy to see or to predict, most of the time. Mandlebrot assures us that there are no absolutes. Market probabilities are relative, provisional and probabilistic. It is hard work and no one wants to be wrong! He concludes that finance is still in a primitive state. We all have much to discover, but he lights the way with some new language and new directions. He invites us to \\"abandon all conventional market assumptions.\\" Thank you Benoit. <br /> <br />Woody Dorsey, Market Semiotics <br />
B0002TT0NW|5.0|Hi guys, <br />Though I'm a bit out of context here (since I'm in my mid-20s), I can say that the prisoner of Azkaban is the best Harry Potter hitherto. The first one was great, but it dragged a bit. The second one was pretty sub-par acting (a lot of repetitious face expressions). This one, the third, was a pleasant surprise. The visual effects were magnificent, the setting for different parts of the movie were absolutely outstanding, the story line kept up with the book's (to a point). I left the theater glad because it was surprising how interesting and visually appealing this movie was. Let us remember that no matter how good a movie is, it will never be as good as the book. So the latter should not be a criterion to gainsay or to vituperate this, or any other, film. If you're a fan of this HP, then by all means get this DVD, if you're not a fan, then buy this DVD for someone who is.
0425152251|4.0|This book is an easy-to-read introduction to the main ideas of philosophy through the centuries. It is written as a novel, in plain language, and it gives you a good starting point for further reading.  <br />The story itself is weak: a young girl starts receiving letters from an unknown philosopher who starts to teach her the most important ideas of the main thinkers. But don't let this fact discourage you as the author tries hard not to send you to sleep and, in my opinion, he succeeds. Be also aware that philosophy keeps your brain pretty busy so it's a good point that the story doesn't require an \\"intellectual effort\\" to be understood. <br />Being a young adult myself, I recommend it for all ages, although some higher instruction is welcome in order to better grasp the concepts. <br />
068987474X|1.0|If you cannot see how the authors of this book are playing with your heads, then the book is targeted at you.  <br /> <br />Many men in the dating game treat dating as just that, a game. Women who fall for the good looking trash driving posh cars to hide their insecurities are not \\"thinking clearly\\" to begin with. The players will continue to play and everything in the book describes those players.  <br /> <br />However, a significant number of men aren't players. There are so many genuine and this book does not do any justice to them. <br /> <br />This book tells you what you want to hear to feel good. Of course you will like the book, just as you will like a massage (or any kind of attention that pampers you). If you can't see behind the screen, you deserve to be brainwashed and lose the best men out there.
0792164903|5.0|Johnny Depp is an exceptional performer. Look at all the movies he has done. He is one of the best Chameleons I have ever seen. He throws himself totally into his roles. Sleepy Hollow is no exception. I love this modification of the original story. Making Ichabod Crane a detective rather than a teacher was brilliant. When he comes from the city to investigate a Sleepy Hollow decapitation, he finds that there is much more to the crime than what meets the eye. The support cast is great and some well known names are amongst them. Tim Burton did a wonderful job of making the atmosphere beautiful and frightful.<br /><br />Christopher Walken is magnificent as the Hessian that is now headless. Walken is another Chameleon that can marvel you with his stylish bravado. He plays the blood thirsty Hessian mercenary to the hilt.  The special effects are incredible including the seamless transitions of the horse and rider entering and exiting a tree. A very dark and spooky rendition compared to the previous versions of Sleepy Hollow. The DVD quality is wonderfully sharp and crisp. This DVD includes a featurette \\"Behind the Legend\\". The are numerous extras that make this the best Halloween movie I have.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|After reading all the reviews about the missing artists and altered or deleted parts, it took a while to decide whether or not to actually buy this hacked up, digitally revised version of this great day in music history.  <br /> <br />I bought it anyway. Even though some of the artists and people involved in the production have let their egos change their opinions about what a truthful presentation is capable of, the good cause (of feeding the hungry) behind it all remains the same - and that makes it worth spending the money. <br /> <br />Who knows, maybe they will produce another \\"special edition\\" DVD later on that presents the event properly. True, it would be yet another way to wring even more cash out of the public, I'd probably end up buying that one too. <br />
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I love Britney Spears. So, she can't sing live, who cares, it is the enjoyment her music brings me that matters. This CD is fun to sing and dance along to in my car and I love the song EVERYTIME. If you like her other albums, you will like this CD.
B000002NIW|2.0|After purchasing this album, I was very disappointed that my first Deftones CD turned out to be some of the most un-inspiring rock I have heard in a long time.  Most of the songs on this album are the same old tired screeching and screaming that could be found elsewhere by such bands as Korn, who I must say do alot better job in tapping into the dark recesses of human angst.  Nearly all the songs on this album are really really awful, unintelligeble noise that grows tiring after awhile.  I give it 2 stars because the Radiohead-esque track \\"Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)\\" is actually a pretty great song, but unfortunately the only good one on this album.
B000003BZ4|5.0|Allman Brothers guitarist Warren Haynes and bassist Allen Woody (the latter of whom died in 2000) started a second band, Government Mule, in late 1994, and the result was a blend of the classic Allmans sound with the power-trio rock of Cream, Mountain, Montrose, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Free, the Jeff Beck Group, and ZZ Top. This debut album is a great start for the new band, with a cover of Free's \\"Mr. Big\\" and several originals being highlights. You should buy this one to see how the classic power trios might sound today.
B0000004V2|5.0|When I first heard this debut record from Manchester's Stone Roses I was completely blown away.  I remember first listening to it during the summer of 1989 and thinking that this was the best band I had heard in a very, very long time.  I originally purchased this record on 12&quot; vinly and wore it out long ago.  I replaced it with a CD and I am now on my second copy as someone stole the original after I played it at a party.  Not only is it still the best debut record that I have ever heard, I firmly believe that it belongs among the best albums of the last 25 years.  To this day this album still stands the test of time. Remember that this record was originally released in the spring of 1989.  There is no weak track on this record. John Squire's guitar playing is simply awesome.  As a fellow drummer I was simply mesmorized by Reni's drumming.  Reni is perhaps the most innovative drummer I have heard since Keith Moon. Although not the greatest live singer, Ian Brown's vocals ooze so much confidence it is obvious why Noel and Liam Gallagher of Oasis were so inspired by this band.  The bass guitarist Mani provides the backbone to the band. Please give this record a listen, I can assure you that you will not regret it!
0151008787|5.0|The child of Ashkenazi Jews who escaped to Jerusalem just before the outbreak of World War II, Amos Klausner (the author's original name) grew up in a scholarly family which encouraged his precocity.  His great uncle Joseph was Chair of Jewish History at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and wrote his magnum opus about Jesus of Nazareth.  His father read sixteen or seventeen languages, wrote poetry, and had an enormous library, while his mother spoke four or five languages, could read seven or eight, and told elaborate stories.<br /><br />Amos grew up a solitary child, encouraged to entertain himself while his parents worked.  Always a writer at heart, he believed that \\"it was not enough for me to be intelligent, rational, good, sensitive, creative.\\"  He often felt he was a \\"one-child show...a non-stop performance,\\" always on display to the relatives, his accomplishments never seeming to be enough.<br /><br />In this elaborate, non-linear autobiography, Oz and his family are seen as archetypal immigrants to Jerusalem, people who arrived when the land was still under British rule and who helped create a new homeland, arguing ferociously about the direction the country should take and the leaders who should lead it.  The history of Jerusalem combines with the author's own genealogical records and his memories about his early family life to create a broad picture of the society in which he grew up and in which his writing talent took root.<br /><br />Detailed, highly descriptive, and filled with introspection about his unusual life, the book shows the tensions within the society and within his family.  After his mother's suicide when he was twelve, he broke with his father, joined a kibbutz, and, at fifteen changed his name.  His observations about himself in relation to his peers and in relation to the outside world, even at that young age, show his inner turmoil and determination to discover a personal identity.<br /><br />As the book moves back and forth in time, the author comments about his writing, the people who influenced him, and his \\"pickpocketing,\\" his \\"stealing\\" of the lives of real people in order to invent stories about them.  His observations about Israel, its leaders, its never-ending wars with the Arabs, and his experience as a resident of a kibbutz for more than thirty years broaden the scope and provide insight into one man's life in this developing country.  Obviously a huge achievement for Oz personally, this is also a huge contribution to the understanding of the growth of a Jewish homeland and to an understanding of how Oz became the writer he is.  Much more detailed and leisurely than Oz's novels, this is slow but satisfying reading for those who admire his novels.

0345347951|3.0|I'm still looking for a classic sci-fi novel that I would thoroughly enjoy.  This one definately was not it.  It is a pretty short book, but I found it rather tiresome.  The description of the aliens was vague at best.  There were also some illogical scenarios.  One of the most illogical was the part about the human who went to the overlords world and returned to earth later.  What did eat for food?  If he didn't need any food, it wasn't made clear why not.   <br /> <br />On the other hand, I think good novels get you to think and this one did that.  It really gets you thinking, but many of the ideas and questions could have been expanded upon.  If it's looked at in a certain way, it's somewhat of a satire on modern society.  Has anyone ever stopped to think that a 200 channel TV is a bit excessive and redundant?  What kind of people are able to keep up with just a fraction of the many programs shown on TV today?  Approximately how many hours a day would one have to watch TV in order to keep up with all of the garbage which is now shown?  It's simply not possible for a person with a full time job to keep up with even a fraction of the programs.  Then why in the world do people need 200 channels?  The author not only gets into the TV industry, but leisure time in general.

B00063MBU8|4.0|This CD was pretty much what I expected after hearing the first single \\"Welcome to my life\\". They've really matured since \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\" (Although the title doesn't reflect on that), and it really shows in their music. It almost sounds like the guys of SP wanted to show the world they could be serious musicians and STILL be pop-punk . The formula is the same, with sing-along chorus' and tightknit verses, but lyrically its a little better than their debut, IMO. On a different subject, I'm not a huge fan of the duel disc idea. It plays just fine in my car stereo, but on my sony walkman, it skips really badly. I would have like an enhanced CD better, but w/e, its still great...
B0000640VO|5.0|In a world of her own design, Amelie retreats from the unfriendliness around her. As she makes her way through the world, she meets with other outcasts, each with their own story to tell. Amelie's attempts to reach out to her fellow loners highlight this story. <br /> <br />Something of a romantic comedy, \\"Amelie\\" is extremely touching, brilliantly directed and wonderfully written. The sparse dialog and heavy narration are only one of the ways in which \\"Amelie\\" breaks with the norm.  <br /> <br />Audrey Tatou is brilliantly expressive as the title character. Jeunet does an excellent job of telling this story using other forms of communication: photomat pictures, videotapes, garden gnomes, to name a few. <br /> <br />\\"Amelie\\" gives us a brief introduction to each character, which lets us feel like we're catching up with a story in progress. Once given some telling little clues into a character's motivations, it's up to us to make the rest of the connections. Each of the characters is worth knowing. <br /> <br />In places, this film is heartbreaking, and in other places absolutely joyous. Perhaps on my Top 10 list of the best movies ever made.
B00009W0U4|1.0|Because I like my movies to have a beginning, a middle, and an end...IN THAT ORDER!!!  I also prefer to have stomach turning experiences at an amusement park and not in front of my television.  The nausea I refer to was not caused by either of the violent scenes which are the core of this movie.  I developed motion sickness due to the spinning, twisting, rolling camera shots.  The movie is gimmick laden and all of the tricks failed to impress me.   <br /> <br />The final scenes, which of course appear near the beginning, would have been far more satisfying had we been aware of the cause.   <br /> <br />No, no, a thousand times NO...No more backward movies.  It's cute, it's \\"artistic\\", and it's STUPID.  STOP IT!  And the camera work...No more shaky shots.  And god please, no more tumbling scenes.  Miss this movie if you can. <br />
B00005QIPH|4.0|Strokes was recommended to me by a student in one of the classes I teach.  I enjoyed \\"Room On Fire\\" and then picked up this earlier release.  Oblivious to \\"the hype,\\" I just listen to the music and see if I connect.  \\"Barely Legal\\" is a good rocker with standard Stroke fuzz distortion on the vocals and an 80's Cars retro sound that appeals to me.  \\"Alone Together\\" also moves joyfully with some blistering guitar and is probably my favorite track.  I'd be interested to read the lyrics if they were printed like Alkaline Trio's great \\"Mourning\\" CD.  \\"Last Nite\\" has some bite to it and a bit of vocal snarl, \\"Last nite she said, 'Baby don't feel so down, it turns me off.'\\"  \\"This Is It\\" is a consistent set of tunes that has a strong appeal.  Enjoy!
0783226063|5.0|As a reader of all the Dune books, I feel like I have enjoyed and suffered through the good and bad of the Dune saga (all 4 books); the best and the worst of Herbert.  Seeing the movie was not a letdown for me after reading the books.  The movie was an opprotunity to get together with friends and family to share recollections of the books; and delight in Lynch's fantastic interpretation of the of first book.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The very long wait to get vintage live Led Zeppelin on DVD was well worth it; this is about as complete and comprehensive as you'll get it!<br /><br />Spanning the classic years of Zep (were there any UN-classic ones?), the performances are awesome as are the picture and sound quality of the DVD's. This is very small criticism, but I think they could've done without including clips from \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", but I guess it would be cool for those who don't own the movie (but if you're a true Zep fan, why wouldn't you own it?)<br /><br />You couldn't ask for a better document of this legendary band; it's a must-have, so buy it!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|The only reason I gave this movie a star at all was for some of the special effects.  The acting was very poor as was the story line.  It seems as though they were trying to attempt to rise to the level of \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\". They didn't even come close.  I made the mistake of purchasing this movie instead of renting it. I will be looking for one of those places you can bring used DVD's to exchange for a different one. Two thumbs down.

B00008PX8P|5.0|let's see, i got the dvd today and i just finished the 5 hours long so i'm kinda stoned yet but i'm gonna try to give my best opinion. This dvd ( with the PINK FLOYD \\" live at pompei\\" in my opinion) is the best musical dvd ever..it's absolutely complete,in terms of footage and stuff that if ya are a true fan ya are gonna love ! ( like tv shows from 69 and stuff).   <br />The sound is AMAZING the whole DVD number two and the first half of the first dvd. I can truly say that i think that i have not ever listen to something as good as kashmir on that one..really! the rest of the second dvd is just awesome and get soooo many different \\" perspectives\\" of the band so it's flows really easy and good. <br />the first one with the show at the Royal Hall is really good too but i gotta say that i didn't like quit much jimmy's guitar at some points ..specially the second half of the show BUT the drum solo in moby dick is one of the best i have ever listen to..awesome! and dazed and confused is really really cool too, the best version i have heard.  <br />well, that's it..like i say, the dvd got sooo many different stuff wich is one of the coolest thing bout it after the music of course, a must have if ya are a fan...and i gotta say i'm 23 years old and it's just blows my mind out ( specially, again, the second one)so if ya are from that era you gotta get it cuz it's going to make you feel like 20 years old again and if ya are in your 20th or less right i assure ya it's gonna blow your mind out and willing to have 45 just to could have lived in the 70's. <br />I'm from Chile..so i'm justifing my spelling mistakes ha
B000002J1O|5.0|In my opinion, this album and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, represent Genesis at it's absolute creative peak. In reading the reviews on Amazon I think it is safe to say that many people would agree with this statement. There is one thing however, that truly sets Selling England apart from ANY other early Genesis studio album with Peter Gabriel. And that is that it was very well recorded and mixed album. People tend to forget that recording technologies that allowed for TRUE high fidelity reproduction on a  mass scale were in their infancy in the late 1960's and early 1970's, the period in which the Gabriel Genesis albums were produced. Indeed the contemporary albums of that period dispalyed a tremendous variation in sonic quality. The first true studio album by Genesis, Trespass , had average sound quality for a recording of that period. The same could be said for Nursery Crimes but Nursery Crimes suffered from some really poor mixing on certain songs that were , well ....a crime. If you doubt this listen to The Musical Box on this album and then listen to it on the very well recorded and mixed 1974 Genesis Live album. It's like listening to two different songs.Hackett's guitar leads explode to life in the live version. Foxtrot was an absolute sonic disaster even by the standards of the day. No amount of re-mastering or post processing could ever rescue this body of work in my opinion. The Lamb, recorded in part in a mobile studio , is also a very mediocre recording. The domestic vinyl versions of this album were famous for revealing a very faint background buzz, and while the early cd version seemed to have dealt with that oddity it was still a very thin, less than dynamic recording . I will concede that the re-mastered Lamb is much improved, but you can only do so much with mediocre masters. Back to Selling England. This album sounds great on vinyl, the early CD release sounds great, and the re-mastered CD sounds INCREDIBLE for something that was recorded in 1973. The vocals are clear, and right out in front where they belong, the bass is tight and defined, the percussion sounds wonderful and all of the stuff that's going on in the mid range of the sonic spectrum remains defined and not muddy. This is quite rare for a complex recording of that era.  It is this quality that makes Selling England my favorite early Genesis album. This was also the first album that Tony Banks used synthesizers on. It's sort of fun to listen to him let loose with his \\"new toys\\" without falling into the electronic noise trap most other early 70's synthesizer players fell into. The  settings he used were soft and emulate real instruments far better than most synthesizer pieces of that period. Selling England By The Pound is perhaps the definitive progressive rock album of it's kind and well worth a listen or re-listen as the case may be.3.

B00005JM0B|1.0|I never liked Jonathan Mostow's films.  All his films aren't like movies, but rather like some very low budget TV special.  This is suppose to be a great scale movie, but I never feel any grandness while watching it.    There is absolutely no character development in the movie.  The John Connor character in this movie could have been played by just anybody under this script and director.  Obviously Jonathan Mostow aren't the type of director that pay much attention to details, which become his major failure as a director.  I wish other directors could have directed this film instead of Jonathan Mostow.  I wouldn't even mind watching James Cameron direct another Terminator movie once again.  Atleast I am pretty sure he won't let us down.  (None of his movies have ever let me down)
0790749815|5.0|It's hard to be cynical about this Alfred Hitchcock classic from 1959.  The impeccable Cary Grant, looking dashing and fit as ever, carries the movie that is filled with deception, lies, murder, chases, you name it..it's there.  He's joined by one of Hitchcock's ubiquitous blondes, the lovely Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint, and the villain is the dashing James Mason.  In an early role, Martin Landau projects cheesy villainry; Leo G. Carroll bounced back from \\"Tarantula\\" as the conniving intelligence director; and Jessie Royce Landis played a rather youthful looking mother to Mr. Grant.<br /><br />The plot should be known to all movie connosieurs by now, but how can one forget the unusual stabbing in the UN; the quiet terror of the biplane's attack; the breathtaking finale on Mount Rushmore.  Ernest Lehman's intelligent script and the always dependable Bernard Hermann's musical score bring this classic to cinematic life for now and ever.  They don't make romantic suspense movies like this anymore!!!

B00004Y6TQ|4.0|First off I must disclose one thing: The songs on the SDTRK for \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" are different recordings than from the actual movie. I know Bjork had a lot of difficulties artistically making this film and I think one of the reasons is explained in the simple fact that the songs are QUITE different than the film- and I'm sure the way that Bjork really wanted them to be. They're more melodic, with better singers and sound more complete. None of this seven people singing eight different parts \\"ScatterHeart\\" this song is done by Bjork alone here, and is FAAAAAAR better than in the movie. Also the \\"I've Seen it All\\" in the movie- we all give him credit for trying to sing with Bjork but that doesn't mean he could sing well. On the album the man she sings with is INCREDIBLE. His voice is smooth and rich and soft and there aren't any of the strange train dancers singing in the background making it like a Broadway Production. It's a lot more enjoyable and despite Bjork's weird sense of taste in music, she pulls everything off here beautifully.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Hell, I seem to hand out five-star ratings like candy! No, today only five-star quality music is worth reviewing. I don't care what the critics say about the Strokes alleged inability to find a fifth guitar chord, \\"Room on Fire\\" proves that, ultimately, you don't need to to make superb music.  <br /> <br />For some, the simplicity of the tracks on the album might make it less music and something more akin to, I don't know, jingle rock. Each track works and the seamlessness of the overall album makes for relatively easy listening. An excellent record to play whilst getting wasted, second only to Oasis' \\"Definately Maybe\\". It is what the Strokes would have had in mind while making \\"Room on Fire\\" and it is an indulgence even whilst sober. Simple guitar riffs are the Strokes' specialty and in \\"Reptilia\\" and \\"12:51\\" they flaunt their wares terrifically. If anything, the album celebrates the Rock 'n' Roll ethos echoed by Radiohead, \\"Anyone can play guitar\\". <br />
B00005JMXX|1.0|What a great shame - all the hype about this movie seemed too good to be true - it's great how only the best bits of a film are ever only shown on the trailers - as i remember it was s short trailer at the time ! <br />It's easy sometimes to overlook an inplausible story line and blank out odd errors in a movie - but after watching this movie for the first time last week and waiting so long to see it after missing it at the movies - i was toatlly disappointed ! <br />The storyline was very weak , with totally unrealistic characters - a very friendly Mexican neighbour that quadrupled it's population overnight because the mighty Americans said they would forget their debts - i think after this massive ice sheet had had destroyed America - Mexico would have been the new super power in the region !! But quite happily the Mexicans allowed not only the civilian population of America to enter the country but what looked like an a whole regiment or more of heavily armed troops - with refugee camps able to talk to manned space stations - wonderful technology . <br />It's a pity that Dennis Quaid picked the same partner to go across the frozen savannah of America with the same guy he went to Antarctica with - only this time his partner could'nt make it - obviously harder terrain across the USA to NY . <br />It was so nice to see all those people on the top of the sky scrapers when the helicopters came - all safe - i wonder what they used , to keep warm in those buildings - no big Victorian fireplaces to burn books in like the library .  <br />Wolves running free across NY - it never did explain who ripped their cage apart and freed them .  <br />I thought it very kind of Dennis Quaid to start the trek back from whence he came across the frozen wastes - him all covered up in warm protective clothes while his son and his friends were in old overcoats and normal shoes ?? I did'nt see em with any provisions either ?? <br />A cloud mass that covered the entire globe - then it disappeared as fast as it came - very convenient ! <br />That had to be the slowest tidal wave ever that hit NY - it seemd to take just the right amount of time for our young hero to save the girl and hide in the library - with no structural damage at all to any buildings - not deep enough to go above the first floor of the library / then he would'nt have found a working phone in the basement / but just deep enough for an unmanned Russian cargo ship to navigate it's way through the streets of NY - the same Russian ship that conveniently had a ready supply of penicillin in the medicine cabinet . I am not going to go on any more - i have relieved a lot of amy anger at the movie here already - all i can say is , if you all you care about are a few special effects that last about 20 minutes in total and nothing else - buy this film / otherwise beware - you could get as frustrated as me watching it drone on for nearly 2 hours . <br /> <br />
B00005B4GU|5.0|Without going into too much detail, \\"Amnesiac\\" is, in many ways, even better than Radiohead's high-water mark album \\"OK Computer\\". I am a huge fan of Radiohead, and I hate to admit this, but the first time I bought this album I thought it was utter rubbish compared to its forerunner \\"Kid A\\".  <br />One night, in the throes of insomnia, I put it on and discovered a depth that I can't believe I didn't see before.  <br />I'm not going to go on about the individual tracks and how each was touching in its own way (suffice to say, though, with the exception of \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" the album is genius). Taste in music is really a subjective matter and this can not be more true for any of Radiohead's work since it broke from its alternative rock roots and became... iconic. Exceptional, though is \\"Pyramid Song\\", which can send shivers down my spine just thinking about it. Thom Yorke's voice is, as always, magnificent and ethereal and the band, as a whole, have accomplished something truly remarkable in this album. <br />It is an acquired taste, just a warning, but once you're hooked it's a perfect track to depression and confusion.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|It would have been great to have the entire London and Philadelphia shows, with all the technical and musical errors shown as part of this \\"historical document.\\" This was a live show! Without Led Zeppelin and some of the the other groups, the Live Aid package is still an important collection that I feel is an essential purchase for any serious music fan. The entire world actually stopped, watched and listened on this remarkable summer day. I am happy to see that the profits from this DVD set will go towards charity.

B00028HBKM|3.0|Frankly, I expected more.  All the hype, all that I heard, I expected a phenomenal movie.  I never got to see it in theatres- it never came to this country.  Perhaps that had an impact- not seeing it on the big screen.  But I just couldn't empath with what I saw.  To me, it was an interesting portrayal of the death of Jesus by an actor.  I think in large part this was due to the lack of the life of Jesus.  There were only a few flashbacks to alleviate what we saw on the screen- there was little of his life and who he was.  We couldn't see him as a human really- although we certainly saw him as a human in suffering.  In order to relate to a character, we also need to see him or her as a human in times of joy.  Instead, it was near unmitigated bloodshed and carnage.<br /><br />I was impressed by the suffering Jesus had to go through.  It was horrible.  But I was moved to tears only once- when Pilate's wife gave burial cloth to Mary.  This was a human moment; I saw people interacting with each other.  This was missing from the life of Jesus.  Or rather, the life of Jesus was missing.  It was one long death.<br /><br />I wanted more at the end too.  It was definitely a Catholic portrayal, with the focus on the death of Christ rather than the resurrection.  (Of course, Protestants tend to err too much in the other direction.)  The end was too short, too quick- I don't get to see the wonder of resurrection.  But at least there was some resurrection at the end.<br /><br />Also Catholic was the focus on Mary.  This helped bring a more human element into the picture, but it was odd how Mary repeatedly became the inspiration for Jesus in His suffering, rather than God being that inspiration.  There's not even a hint of that in the text.  Also very weird were the bits of demonic elements, looking something like baboons.  And seeing a near-naked Jesus at the end is...unsettling.<br /><br />While there have been many claims of anti-Semitism in this movie, I saw no evidence of this.  It appeared to be what it was- a bunch of Jews and Romans killing a Jew, who had Jewish family and friends.  In fact, it presented far fewer positive portrayals of Romans/Gentiles than do the Gospels.  It is unfortunate that the line \\"His blood be upon us and all our children!\\" was stricken out of the subtitles, though kept in the Aramaic- it is a moving line, true to the original text and history.  Lest the Gospels are now themselves anti-Semitic...<br /><br />It was enjoyable to hear the original speech.  Though we are still not sure if Jesus spoke Greek or Aramaic on a regular basis, it felt like I was getting closer to the feel of what the Lord actually said.  And, knowing some Arabic, it was fun to catch the occasional word and phrase that I recognized.<br /><br />I do recommend this movie.  It gives a moving portrayal, a different perspective, and a helpful understanding of the actual times and death of Jesus.  It just wasn't what I had hoped for and expected, without the life of Jesus.as- a bunch of Jews and Romans killing a Jew, who had Jewish family and friends.

B0001MDPV8|5.0|There are reasons why Nas' career has been benchmarked to this hip hop classic. Illmatic has been spread around as Nas' NY crown. Now i cant back up on how Illmatic can arguably be the best album of hip hop, or on how Nas is \\"the king of NYC\\". But i can say what makes this album so timeless, and the same goes for Hova's \\"Reasonable Doubt\\".  <br /> <br />Illmatic captures the purest form of street hip hop in rawest form. This isn't Nas rapping about how long he's been in the game, nor how much albums he's sold. It's about the life the streets have pushed to his side and how he can just put his arm around it and spit about it in his artform. The only way he knows how to. I have never been to New York, but his track \\"NY State of Mind\\" paints it all in my head, in black and white. \\"One Love\\" expresses how life can change thoroughly outside prison cell walls and how the bond of a spoken letter can mean so much. Nas' main flow through the album grabs your ear, but his lyrics make them bleed, and he doesnt need a complex vocab to do it. \\"Represent\\" is still one of the best \\"street-hop\\" tracks i have ever heard, thanks to Premier's production. The only problem with this 10 year anniversary release is the extra remixed tracks, which have no fit in Illmatic. But i guess that can be a bonus. Bouncin' street beats and productions, NY rap, and well, just life in general. This album simply just puts it in this perspective, that \\"Life's a Bitch\\" and that Nas had something to say about it. Again, its hip hop in the purest form, and maybe thats why he hasn't been able to top Illmatic's state of mind. Because he doesnt rap about trying to be at the top. He now raps about how he IS on top. <br /> <br />Either way, Illmatic does deserve to be spoken of, it deserves to be celebrated after 10 years and more, and it deserves to be in any hip hop lover's library. If not his edition, then the original. pz..
B000063DGC|5.0|For those of you wondering what these people are talking about bootlegs, they are talking about live concerts that are recorded on disc and not official albums. Just for the record there are at least half a dozen Ozzy bootlegs with Randy Rhoads in them but they are extremely rare and hard to find. Tribute is the only official live album with Randy. If you find any of these rare bootlegs, buy it! The stuff you hear on Tribute is actually Randy and crew on one of their OFF nights! This was actually recorded for a show on tv! And it is mindblowing! I got this bootleg from a concert in Canada that exceeds this album in every single field and it was perhaps the best damn live music I have ever heard.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I consider myself a pretty serious music fanatic and am borderline obcessed. Rarely do you find a band that has the abitlity to lyrically, vocally, and intrumentally blow you away. This isn't one of those albums that grows on you and you learn to love. I had the chills the first time I heard it and continue to get them at every listen. It is easily one of the best albums I've ever heard. If you have ears, you souldn't hesitate to buy this album.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|My first Van Halen album. It rocks, good solid rock. To whoever wrote that review before mine: how dare you compare Limp Bizkit or Static X to Van Halen! That's like comparing store-brand cola to authentic Coca-Cola! Also, \\"Eruption\\" is GUITAR, not KEYBOARDS! Better recheck your boots, kid. Anyways, \\"Eruption\\" is amazing.... Eddie is so incredible. My favorite song on here is \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\", but every song is good. All killer, no filler. If you like rock at all, buy this. If you don't, go buy a polka record.

1400031087|3.0|The book started strong, but as it went along, the same cuss word was used almost every sentence, and who proof read this book?  Many words were capitalized in the middle of the sentence that should not have been. I like the interaction between James and Lilly.  He had an over kill on his mother's crying, but did not tell enough about the blond girl he loved.  The book ending was not what I thought it would be.  I thought the AA concept would finally register.  No man is an island, but he came close.  The description of the dental work (with no pain medication) was exceptional.  I do hope he realizes that there really is a God.  How could he not after taking a trip to hell.
B000002LOE|5.0|I can't believe I hated this when I first heard it! Brilliant, beautiful music worthy of the classical greats. It is my all-time favorite album. Each song is a unique and perfict gem, weather you're talking about the dark beauty of &quot;Low&quot;, the up-beat melodies of &quot;Radio Song&quot;, or the spine-tingling &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;. This album is also home to the infamous &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;, a wonderful and genuinely happy song that has gotten loads of scorn exactly for that reason. Too bad. R.E.M. is just as great happy as they are bitter. And this album features the best of both worlds. It has an acoustic, almost classical music feel to it. One of the guest artists here was Kate Pierson from the B-52's. Her fantastic singing is added to three songs, including &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; and the addictive gem &quot;Me In Honey&quot;.<br />This is one of the best albums by one of the best bands in world history. There is absolutely nothing here for anyone to pick at. The brilliant rythems, stunning lyrics, and high feelings. Every member shines in their craft. R.E.M. at their peak of success and artistic genius. Not to be missed!

Welcome Simple Plan, you are new band that kids around the world will worship.  But its not enough for everyone else.  ok so i am a sucker for simple plan.  I don't have any idea why i do, but i do.  This is an ok album, a bit too poppy but it is the market they are aiming for a spose.  So in that case three stars for Crazy, me against the world and everytime and a few others were ok.  Probly wont stay in the discman for long.  But still an OK album.
B00009NOF4|5.0|They stole from themselves, ironically, in producing this Radiohead incarnate album. However, it's musically a masterpiece, and although rather repetitive I really enjoyed this album. If you enjoyed their past albums, I see no reason why you would not enjoy this one. Darkly beautiful, multi-textured, with a kind of schizophrenic, surreal, claustrophobic feel to it. It's like stepping into a nervous dream, with beauty and dark edginess pulling at each other for control of the illusion. Not an improvement over their past works, but for sure it stands on its own as a solid, classic masterpiece of music making. I highly recommend it.

B0000DBJ2B|5.0|Directed by Jim Henson and Frank Oz. This was a masterpiece delivered by Henson's Creature Shop. Visually brilliant. Musically brilliant. The story is also genius. Big feelings in a surreal fantasy world. For adults or the kids (some dark profanity IS NOT suitable for younger children.) Made of puppets and artifical landscapes. If you liked the Lord of the Rings films, you'll love this rare gem. It's like getting lost in a dream, and you won't want to leave.
B00005JMXX|3.0|OVERVIEW: I believe there are two ways to watch \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". The 1st way is to go in with lofty expectations and look for real-life happenings backed up by facts and real-world stuff. The 2nd way is to go into this movie not expecting much at all --> hey another Hollywood disaster flick with some cool special effects! I went into this movie with no expectations... and for the most part enjoyed it. The storyline was weak at best, the acting was uninspired, but the movie as a whole was brought together by the terrible weather. Severe ice and snow storms, tidal waves (hence flooding), tornados, and more reaking havoc on planet Earth.<br /><br />THE GOOD: The special effects were awesome. The huge waves coming into NYC looked incredible. The waves engulfing the Statue of Liberty and taking over the streets were very cool. The numerous high speed tornados in Los Angeles were nicely done, but even the average viewer could tell they were computer generated. The rain and snow looked good and the freezing effects were believeable. Jake Gyllenhaal put in his finest performance since \\"October Sky\\" (1999).<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: The cast is weak. Dennis Quaid (as father Jack Hall, special-meteorologist-predictor-guy) is just not on my \\"top actors\\" list. Quaid is a better \\"made-for-TV\\" movie actor than one on the big screen (let alone to carry most of the movie). Outside of \\"Frequency\\", \\"The Parent Trap\\" and \\"The Rookie\\", it's been too many years in between since I've really enjoyed one of his movies. Jake Gyllenhaal (\\"October Sky\\", \\"Donnie Darko\\", \\"Bubbleboy\\") was fine as Sam Hill (the son of Jack) and I truly believe he is an up-and-comer in Hollywood, but, he and his agent just haven't found that next 'right' script. Sela Ward is present briefly as the supportive Hall wife. Other than these 3 movie family members... you won't recognize anyone - the remaining cast of hundreds are no-names. Was Quaid the first choice here, or did every other actor decline the lead role for this movie? There are so many impossible (or nearly impossible) things going on in \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" that if you sit and analyze everything that's happening you won't enjoy the movie. For example, after Jack Hall's truck gets stuck in the snow, he decides to trek from Philly to NYC to rescue his son... no small feat to do when the severe cold is killing everyone who walks outside in about 15 seconds. Did anyone mention the distance of 100 miles between the two cities? Or the tennis rackets he duck-taped to his feet so he could walk on the 50-foot snow drifts? The wolves chasing Sam on the ship were notebly exaggerated computer-made knock offs. The tidal wave coming into the city arrived in seconds, yet young Sam could run half a football field and back to save the girl and get back inside before the wave hits them. What about the rest of the world (this movie concentrated solely on America)? It would have been neat to see France's Eiffel Tower blitzed by the deep freeze or at least knocked over by a twister. The list goes on.<br /><br />MISC: The extras on this DVD are minimal. There are 2 commentaries to choose if that's your thrill. One with director Emmerich. The 2nd with the co-writer, editor and director of photography (yawn!). Did Quaid & Gyllenhaal decline? There are 2 deleted scenes (yawn), and a making-of footage for your PC (what the?). If you're looking for an accurate rendention of the effects of global warming - you'll be sorely disappointed (the Bush administration has not endorsed this movie). Come into this movie with few or no expectations and an eye for some cool weather related special effects and perhaps you'll get more out of it. Rating: A generous 3 stars.the lead role for this movie?

B000003TA4|5.0|The reason why I'm not giving this a full 5-stars is because this is pretty teent-bopperish, but all-in-all it is a very good album. This was Nirvanas breakthrough and their first major label release. Sure it wasn't their best (that would be 'In Utero') but it still had its fair share of greatness. It even started a whole rock-reform movement called grunge which (thank God) wiped out horrible pop-rock aka hairmetal and set the standard for countless bands to come. Most of those bands were horrible (like G@y Charlotte and S*!*ty Plan), but at least they can trace their roots to a good band (Nirvana) and not be so bad (yes people, I give those crappy bands 1 and 2 star reviews). Every grunge band was different (Soundgarden was the most creative, Alice In Chains was the darkest, Pearl Jam was the most melodic and Nirvana was all about simplicity) so that made the movement even more important .To sum it all up Nirvana basically popularized a genre that nobody thought would stand up to the almighty Van Halen, Metallica and Guns N' Roses. <br />   This album got so big not only by 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' but also by its uniqueness.  <br />   The opening to 'SLTS' is a bit of a wierd one, but once the drums come out then WHAM! A load of grunge-driven rock slams into your ears and makes you keep coming back for more! The solo is pretty bad though, but like I said, Kurt was simple, meaning he wasn't a great guitar player yet he still managed to rock! Vocals are very good too, Cobain has a great range from the verse to pre-chorus to chorus. Rating: 9.5/10 <br />   'In Bloom' has that sort of feeling to them, not only is the bassline and the drumline good, but Kurt shows his great array of vocal talent and delivers it all in one great song, 'In Bloom' has to be one of my favorites. Rating: 11/10 <br />   'Come As You Are' is a very strange yet satisfying song. The lyrics may sound pretty dumb, but just remember: Kurt was a simple musician and those people tend to make goofylyrics in some songs (we will run into this later in 'Lithium'). Krists watery bass intro is a must-have in a soft/heavy song like this. And at about halfway through the drums start getting louder and we reached the heavy part when Kurt sings \\"When I swear that I dont have a gun\\". A great song. Rating: 9.25/10 <br />   'Breed' is not one of the better songs on the album, but that doesn;t necessarily mean its bad. Its actually a fair song with more goofy lyrics and a simple solo, again not the best but definately worth a couple of listens. Rating: 7.5/10 <br />   Now we've hit 'Lithium' and this is where the dumb lyrics of 'CAYA' come back. The chorus could have been a bit more poetic then just \\"Yeah\\" but still, that word alone is just assuring you that Kurt is going through a nervous breakdown, so dont get bored of it. Theres also a pretty sweet 5 second bass solo here to, it demonstrates Krists' ability to play. Rating: 9/10 <br />   Its time for the acoustic softness of the serious yet soothing 'Polly'. Its about a 14 year old girl who got raped in Kurts hometown. I know it sounds a bit strange but this really shows the poetic side of Cobain and demonstrates that he can use acoustics much better than electrics. Rating: 10/10 <br />   Oh God, 'Territorial Pissings' is not the best song here, its okay, but compared to earlier songs it really gets the second half of the album a rough start. Its very fast paced but stupid if you think about it, even if the Ramones inspired it. The worst song on the album. Rating: 6/10 <br />   After track seven you'd think that the rest of the secong half would be pretty boring, but then 'Drain You' starts and immediately proves you wrong with some strange lyrics and great guitars. This is a very good song that has an interlude immediately following the second chorus, and then slams back into the tune that you've grown accustomed to. Rating: 9/10 <br />   'Lounge Act' is a lot like the previous track, but it has some suprising new twists in it too. After the second chorus Kurt just starts yelling like a freakin' maniac and sending some adreniline into you, the beat is very good too. Rating: 9.5/10 <br />   Okay, 'Stay Away' is a little too simple for me. There really isn't anything to this song escept for a pounding drum beat, its pretty boring if you think about it. Rating: 7/10 <br />   Right, now its time for the unbelievable 'On A Plain'. This song cannot be sung any better, it seriously got my attention the very first time I heard it and I couldn't stop listening to it. Although I'm not a huge fan of the chorus it seems that everything else was done absolutely perfectly. The best song on the album. Rating: 11/10 <br />   Now we come to the very emotional 'Something in the Way', and what an ending it is. Its about Kurt living under a bridge when he was a child, its another softee that tends to rock out loud. This is softer than track six because it has the cello in the backround. A very good song and worthy of a great ending. Rating: 10.5/10 <br />  Well there you have it. At least that stupid Avril fan was right about ONE THING, and that was that this album kicked ass! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!
B000067CPX|2.0|This album seems to confirm that the Chili Peppers went supernova with BloodSugarSexMagik, and have continued to burn out ever since. Unless they can get back to the down and dirty funk, and explore that region of music again, be prepared for disappointment.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Walter Disney must be spinning in his coffin. Release these DVDs. Porco Rosso, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind and My Neighbor Totoro are on hold for 6 more Years, this is sad, very sad. Are these movies a threat to Disney's Cartoon Empire? <br />  <br />
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Critics of this movie have a point -- this story writes its own rules of logic and cause and effect.  If you don't accept its premise, then you will probably ridicule every twist and turn in the story.    I accepted the premise, though, and though not all the pieces work, the resultant story was so unpredictable and unusual that I found myself quite engrossed.  I was in fact surprised that this film was directed by the writers of Final Destination 2, which I disliked.  But this time, I found myself drawn into this world of parallel realities and possibilities drawn up by directors/writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber.  Where Final Destination 2 was all shock tactics and gratuitous gore set pieces, The Butterfly Effect does its job much more by playing with your expectations and sympathies.    The performances are fine, with Ashton Kutcher doing a good job playing college psych major Evan, whose memory blanks out at key points in his life, leaving black holes he must fill in for himself.  The character is basically a god-like figure with the ability to change the realities of everybody around him by manipulating his own decisions.  This alone makes for a fascinating character motivation -- not quite complete altruism, but a mad dash to save the people he loves.  Melora Walters, Elden Henson and William Lee Scott tackle multiple roles with good results, and central figure Amy Smart has never looked dreamier, giving a solid emotional motivation for Evan's character.  The switching of roles and characters is an oft-used TV device, but it's done with enough aplomb and variety here to make the exercise highly entertaining.    If I have one grudge, it's the pacing.  The first act of the film lurches forward jarringly (though not without reason), and scenes are often a little too short.  As a result, it's a little hard to accept when the central conceit first happens; it's like we were set up for a psychological thriller and then the filmmakers cheated us into a supernatural solution.  Still, it was somewhat fun to be completely disoriented by the \\"what the blazes?\\" middle of the film, and after the initial lurches, the narrative moves forward quite nicely.    Say what you will about this film, but you can't say it doesn't take risks.  And the script is smart enough to ground its very far-fetched premise with enough setups, payoffs, catharsis and danger that even if you don't buy the conceit, you probably won't be bored.  Me, I enjoyed this film greatly and would recommend it highly.
B0002IU988|5.0|Well, Listened to their CD, went to their concert, and they are just amazing! I have never heard a cd with as much potential. These musicians have heart. They have passion. They are better than the 30 million CD-selling Creed, not to take anything away from them. Alter Bridge is the future of rock. Tremonti, hands down is the best guitarist around, Flip, has came into his own with the drums, Marshall, backs Tremonti very well. Kennedy, well-should have been known for a lot longer. Very good melodic singer, and a great guy. I reccomend the whole cd from Tremonti's attack of the guitar on, \\"Find the Real\\", to the potentially best single of the year, \\"Open Your Eyes\\". \\"Shed My Skin\\", is awesome, supported by Kennedy's vocals. \\"In Loving Memory\\" is beautiful, and well put together. They are the future of rock.
B00024I2Z4|3.0|Yes, I have heard many stories about Mulan since I was young and I have grown to accept that the different versions existed might have presented contradictory facts about the legendary Mulan. Disney's Mulan, despite the fact that it's highly entertaining with the wonderful animation and catchy songs, I cannot help but am irritated by the writers'/producers' ignorance about the background historical facts. Mulan ia a legendary hero and I'm not sure which dynasty did she live. I'm not even sure whether she was real. However, one thing I know for sure: the Chin Emperor was not a benevolent, but a cruel ruler. It is generally agreed that Chin dynasty ended in the rebellion of Xiang Yu and Liu Pang, and Xiang Yu didn't get killed in the comical way portrayed in the cartoon. In history, the ending of the Chin dynasty was welcomed and Xiang Yu was generally being upheld as one of the heros.  It's fine with me that Mulan is a well-liked film but I hope that the viwers will keep in mind that the chinese history bit in Mulan is entirely inaccurate.

B0000085N4|5.0|Why these guys didn't just surpass all the rest is a mystery to me.  This is more real Rock than most of the 80's music.  Don't get me wrong I love the 80's hair era for the fun and all but it was all disposable.  The Cult transcend the trends and could back it all up with some powerful riffs.  This wasn't their best but it still kicks.
B000059Z8J|5.0|First of all I want to say this to the punks who are writing bad reviews for this movie... Superman: The Movie is THE classic superhero movie. Nobody will remember X-men in 30 years or the performance by Hugh Jackman. People remember this movie for a reason..it has HEART. Ya, maybe the new movies are more flashy but so what, you watch a movie for special effects? This movie was like a drug for me growing up. IT IS THE BEST AND NO ARGUING...ITS A DAMN FACT!
B00008PW3Q|3.0|A lot of ardent reviewers are hailing this as \\"a return to form\\" or even \\"one of their best\\" but that's simply not true unless you are referring to the post-1987 Fleetwood Mac. I'm a Fleetwood Mac fan from waaaayyyy back in the very early 1970s and consider Lindsey Buckingham, along with Mike Nesmith, an outstanding musician. I would also agree that much of Stevie Nicks' solo output in the 1980s was often superb, so I've established my credentials as \\"a hardcore fan\\" - hell, I bought Mick's early solo album \\"The Visitor\\" and STILL play it occasionally. But this album, after constant playing since its release, appears to suffer from being what people \\"think\\" Fleetwood Mac should sound like. Some of the tracks are undeniably good...but not excellent and, while one could usually pick up a Fleetwood Mac album pre-1987 and be guaranteed that almost all of it would be good, this has a number of tracks where Nicks especially seems to be \\"phoning it in\\" and where Buckingham's contribution is far less passionate and vivid than other work. It's been, dare I say it in light of earlier Dashut/Buckingham work, over-engineered and over-produced. It sounds, for all the world, as though it's been put together by a committee of music historians rather than musicians. It sounds CLICHED. As if someone has put together every Fleetwood Mac riff and hook from earlier material and assembled a paint by numbers Fleetwood Mac album. Prior to its release, I replayed constantly over several months all of the Fleetwood Mac team and solo material I own (not a lot of post-1987 stuff in there) and this album AS A WHOLE just doesn't stand up to comparison with that material. There ARE several good tracks, but it doesn't hang together as a good album overall and I suspect that the rapturous reception is very much due to the fact the there has been a lot of poor music released as 'Fleetwood Mac\\" since 1987. I hope that the forthcoming solo release by Buckingham doesn't have the same problems.
B0002ZMITY|5.0|Great movie and finally available here.  This movie came out years ago in the UK.  Why does it take so long for some movies to come here?  If you like Ali G at all watch this movie, it's a feature length hollywood style film, very well done, and looks like it had a good budget.  Now they just need to release all of his best of Ali G shows from Britain.  GET THIS MOVIE!
B00003CXCT|5.0|The films look absolutely fantastic! The sound 'booms'! In the documentary Bill Moyers says it's fun to watch Star Wars, and he is exactly right. I'm in my thirties and I enjoyed these films with the same enthusiasm I had when I was a kid. <br /> <br />Ultimately, the changes are not even close to ruining the experience of watching these films. I even got goosebumps seeing Hayden Christensen at the now truly exuberant end of 'Jedi'. It was a great sneak peek into seeing how the prequel trilogy will tie into the original. My seven year old kid had a goofy smile from ear to ear after we watched 'Jedi' together and he saw Anakin back with the good guys. I remember feeling the same way. <br /> <br />'The Empire Strikes Back' is simply perfect. I watched this one by myself late at night, in the dark, and I was completly transported to 'Hoth', 'The Asteroid Field', and 'Bespin'. This episode is Star Wars: High Octane. Intensely character driven and visually engrossing. The most realized film of the entire series. <br /> <br />However, 'A New Hope', for me, is still the best. The one that started it all 'explodes' with enthusiasm from start to finish. I remember when it came out the first time and how crazy everyone was for it. People just couldn't see it enough times. Myself included. I used to beg my Mom and grandmother to take me again and again. And they would. And I remember just being elated after coming out of the theater with refreshed visual memories to go home with. Watching 'A New Hope' on DVD was a refresher of those feelings, and I truly marvel at how much I still love this movie. <br /> <br />And I think that ties in with Bill Moyer's point from the documentary. Star Wars is fun to watch. It truly is visually arresting. It is all in the designs of the costumes, the spacecraft, the droids (my favorites), and on and on. Include an engaging storyline and all the other 'moments' that tell that story and you've got a classic that I never tire of watching every fewyears. The prequel films are lacking but they're really just as fun to watch. From 'Phantom Menace', the pod race is spectacular, and the duel between Kenobi and Maul is the best in the entire series so far. And I always find myself sitting through the last 45 minutes of 'Attack of the Clones' when it's on HBO. It's all good. <br /> <br />If Star Wars wasn't still a 'living beast' or 'open book', what with another film coming out soon, I don't think Lucas would be tinkering with it as much. Changes being made even from the '97 versions really do express an artist's sometimes obsessive approach to a work in progress. If Lucas was available to someone telling him \\"let it be\\", maybe he would. If Lucas didn't own the films like he does, there surely would be director's cuts, but you better believe that if Fox owned everything Star Wars they would draw the line as to how much tinkering they would allow. <br /> <br />No matter how you look at it, Lucas is telling a six part story. It's kind of too bad for us, the audience, to be so part of the editing and re-editing as it happens, yet it is at little cost. He doesn't exactly make Boba Fett Vader's brother or put in a CGI Chewbacca. He doesn't change anything detrimental to the story at all. <br /> <br />And if the new end to 'Jedi' is any indication as to how it all ties together, then I'll even go see the next movie on the day it opens. <br /> <br />The Star Wars DVD's are a perfect 5 stars.
068987474X|5.0|As a personal coach working with relationship-oriented singles looking for a life partner relationship ([...] I found the hot new book to be \\"He's Just Not That Into You, The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys.\\" It's by a writer and a consultant from the tv show \\"Sex and the City\\" -- a man (Greg, now married) and a woman (Liz, still dating). They helped create the phrase \\"he's just not that into you\\" in the writer's room, and turned it into the phrase du jour to explain why men behave so badly in relationships.    Unlike some of the books I've previously read, such as \\"What Men Want; Three Professional Single Men Reveal to Women What It Takes to Make a Man Yours,\\" and the biblical \\"The Rules,\\" Greg and Liz don't try to explain to women what men want, how to get them to want you, and how to figure them out when they don't. I'm happy to report that \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" cuts straight to the chase, and tells women that there is really only one important, basic rule to understanding men:    If he's \\"into you,\\" then HE'LL pursue YOU.    That means he'll 1) ask you out, 2) call you, 3) clearly date you (not just want to \\"hang out\\"), 4) want to have sex with you, 5) not be having sex with someone else, 6) not only want to see you when he's drunk, 7) want to marry you, 8) isn't breaking up with you, 9) not disappear on you, and 10) not be a \\"selfish jerk, a bully, or a really big freak.\\" These were taken from the titles of chapters 1 - 10, so you can see that Greg and Liz have clearly translated men's non-verbal behavior into a language women can understand.    Having worked with singles for over 19 years as a psychologist and life coach, I've been giving this message to women as well. It's just that I wasn't a writer on a hit sitcom coining catch phrases. But I've been aware of this \\"law of nature\\" for awhile - that when a man meets a woman he wants, then he will take the lead and pursue her. Relentlessly. Anything less than full-blown pursuit is an indicationthat \\"he's just not that into you.\\"    In case women need to know WHY a guy would prefer to say to a woman \\"I'm really busy right now\\" or \\"let's just hang out and be friends,\\" Greg explains \\". . we [men] would rather lose an arm out a city bus window than tell you simply, `you're not the one' . . [because] we are quite sure you will kill us or yourself or both - or even worse, cry and yell at us. We are pathetic.\\"     Greg and Liz work hard throughout the book to repeatedly tell single women that they are good enough to have a guy who is \\"into\\" them. Every time they decipher and shoot down a man's covert communication, and the woman's excuses for it, they'll say \\"don't waste the pretty.\\" How great is that??!!    In my work coaching singles to find and create a life partner relationship, I know how valuable it is to have an objective third party tell you the truth as they see it, especially as it relates to relationships. Some women will get it from their girlfriends, their mothers, or maybe even their therapists (where they'll go when completely distraught and depressed in their attempts to find \\"the one\\").     And then there are books. I think that \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" will serve it's purpose to help a woman figure out if she's being pursued, or not. It will also tell her to move on and find a guy who wants her, no excuses necessary.

B0002V7O3I|5.0|Joe Dante has forged a unique career by making tiny, personal films that just happen to cost millions of dollars and frequently push state-of-the-art visual effects to the next level. Though many critics and younger audience members view his work as overly referential, those of us who grew up on a Cold War diet of 50s science-fiction films, stories by Bradbury, Clarke and Heinlein, and cultural touchstones like MAD Magazine, E.C. Comics and Famous Monsters of Filmland know exactly where Joe's heart lies. His finest films are love letters to his own childhood. <BR>And mine.<br />As much as I admire all of Dante's work, my two favorites have always been MATINEE and EXPLORERS. It's a pleasure to finally see the latter appear on DVD. Although situated smack-dab in the middle of the 80s, the film is a big-brotherly pat on the shoulder to every kid who tried to build a spaceship in his backyard while Dad loaded the final bags of rice into the fallout shelter. Screenwriter Eric Luke (whom, as I recall, had been clerking at a Los Angeles science-fiction bookstore when this script sold) has crafted a tale of supreme silliness laced together with just enough plausible beats to allow the audience its all important willing suspension of disbelief. (No, the kids don't actually build their own spaceship, just the lovely Tilt-A-Whirl-based contrivance that rides within the alien forcefield technology they've happened upon.) The cast is remarkable; joining Dante's regular stock company (Roger Corman stalwart Dick Miller etc.) are 15-year-olds River Phoenix and Ethan Hawke in their screen debuts, the great character actor James Cromwell (BABE) as Phoenix's father (and, apparently, one of Wernher von Braun's V-2 boys), and another Dante frequent flyer, Robert Picardo (Star Trek - Voyager), in a triple role as the alien Wak, his space-trucker dad, and a badly-dubbed drive-in hero named Starkiller (a rather sly riff on the ever-popular STAR WARS trilogy.)<br />The sets, visual effectsand art direction, particularly in the alien spacecraft scenes that occupy most of the third act, are remarkable and still have impact 20 years later. If there's a storytelling flaw to be found here - and I don't happen to think there is but many contemporary critics clearly did - I suspect it may lie in the atypical passivness of our explorers upon finally reaching their goal. Nothing blows up, nobody comes up with any great schemes, universes are neither saved nor lost. It's been argued that the main difference between movies and real life is that movies characters do stuff - they take action and make things happen. In life, mostly, we watch and wait. Well in this movie that's exactly what our heroes do - they strive to get somewhere unique, and once there they watch, they learn, they evaluate, they explore. Anethema to most current audiences (and execs), but exactly in keeping with the tone and requirements of this story, and thrilling for the depth of humor and imagination on display.   <br />Few critics (or paying audience members) gave EXPLORERS much of a break upon first release. Against a crowded field of cute and resourceful kid movies (E.T., GOONIES, YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES etc.), it must have seemed like more of the same, differing only in the number of Chuck Jones references. But if you're a fan of heartfelt, literate science-fiction I implore you to take a chance. EXPLORERS's opening flying dream sequence both sets the tone and establishes the underlying theme of this film. This warm, deeply silly and utterly delightful movie surges and flows with a logic and timeless lilt that's usually only found in the best dreams - those all-too-rare ones you just hate to wake up from.
1400079179|5.0|I think I was one of the last people on the planet earth to pick up this novel but I am glad I did!  I travel a lot and for the last few years, I think every third person in the airport was carrying THE DA VINCI CODE. I bought the book after some friends in my Sunday School Class were talking about how good it was. Like most people, I couldn't put it down. I am able to distinguish fact from fiction and since I read a book to be entertained, DaVinci filled the bill. I was entertained during the entire story. It is easy reading, compelling and fast paced. A lot of research went into this novel and it raised some questions that were easy to investigate. I know the Catholic Church re-wrote the Bible centuries ago but reading this book did not shake one iota of the faith I already have. I read it as FICTION with bits and pieces of fact interspersed!  But it certainly was a fun read!<br />Now I am looking forward to the movie.

I should have known better, then to trust those artsie critic's tastes. <br /> <br />If you want to see Bill Murray in a truly oscar-caliber role, then go see him as Ernie \\"Big Ern\\" McCracken in Kingpin.  He just gets funnier and funnier the more you see it!
0151006903|5.0|This is very much a novel about language and meaning -- for those who don't know, it comes as no surprise to learn that Eco is a semiotician.  If questions of truth, or faith, or history are impossibly boring to you, then there are other novels of medieval times that you will enjoy far more than this one.  If you find such questions even slightly appealing, the novel will most likely have entrance you and get you thinking about things you never thought of before.  Baudolino, the protagonist and narrator, is a marvelously complicated character: he has little regard for what we would call objective truth, and sometimes fails to do the right thing, but he is brave, and charming, and clever, and his motives are (mostly) noble.   <br />The first part of the book takes place in Barbarossa's Europe, which Eco paints as a colorful, dynamic, dangerous world in which Baudolino maneuvers his way through the hypocrisies and good intentions of court and church.  In the second part the action moves more into the world of myth, which at first seems a marvelous adventure but turns out, like the court Baudolino left behind, to have a darker side.  There is a good deal mentioned about the development of Christian doctrine and the identification of various heresies, but most concepts are explained well enough that anyone vaguely familiar with Christianity will be able to follow along (and while it goes deeper into ideas than, say, the Da Vinci Code, it doesn't get completely bogged down -- there's still quite a lot of action.)  Because Baudolino tells his audience (and us) at the beginning that he is a great liar, we don't know how much of his story to believe.  This matters quite a bit to Master Niketas, who is listening to Baudolino's tale in the book, so it's obvious to ask ourselves whether it matters to us.  I don't think so -- at least, you can enjoy Baudolino's story whether you believe him or not.  Some people who have read Eco's non-fiction works may find the ideas Baudolinograpples with to be more of the same, but for people like me who have only read his novels, this is probably his best since The Name of the Rose.  Both Baudolino and the other characters are well developed and multifaceted, and the plot is a good balance between the intellectual drama of searching for (and creating) truth and the physical-world drama of war, romance, court intrigue, and adventure.  It's a beautiful story, and I am glad Eco has written it down.
0312958455|5.0|\\"The Last Coyote\\" is Michael Connelly's fourth book, was first published in 1995 and features Harry Bosch as its central character. Something of Bosch's background has been covered in the previous three books. Bosch's mother was a prostitute who was murdered when he was twelve - he spent his teenage years in and out of youth halls. He enlisted in the army and served in Viet-Nam, before returning home and joining the police force. Once a member of the LAPD's elite Robbery-Homicide Division, Bosch currently works at the Hollywood Division's Homicide table. He's still a jazz-loving loner, seen by some as a maverick, with a taste for coffee, beer and cigarettes. There have been some changes in his life since the end of \\"The Concrete Blonde\\", though - his relationship with Sylvia Moore has finished and his house has been damaged in a recent earthquake. Despite the fact that it's been declared unfit for habitation, he's still unofficially living there.  <br /> <br />As \\"The Last Coyote\\" opens, Bosch is in trouble with the department again. After his boss, the bureaucratic Harvey \\"98\\" Pounds, interfered with the questioning of a suspect, Bosch lost his temper and pushed Pounds head-first through an office window. As a result, he's been placed on involuntary stress leave and has to attend regular sessions with Dr Carmen Hinojos, a psychiatrist at Behaviorial Sciences Division. These sessions contribute to Bosch deciding to investigate the one case that really matters to him : his mother's murder. Although he's working on the case unofficially and has lost his badge - albeit temporarily - he still manages to pull the original case file. Opened in October 1961, it was investigated at the time by two detectives called Eno and McKittrick. Leaving aside the apparent lack of effort to solve the case, a few things seem odd to Harry. The mentions an interview with Johnny Fox - his mother's pimp, and therefore an obvious suspect. However, the file doesn't contain an interview summary. A passing reference to Arno Conklin also catches his eye. At the time, Conklin would have been one of the city's top prosecutors and subsequently became the city's DA. Although exactly what role he had is unclear, his involvement in the case seems curious. The only other person apparently interviewed was Meredith Roman - a 'colleague' and old friend of his mother's, who'd also worked for Johnny Fox. The starting point, Harry feels, is to track these people down - though cut off from the LAPD's resources, he has to be a little more creative than usual in how he achieves this. He starts by using a new contact at the LA Times, Keisha Russell, to gather some stories on Conklin and Fox. Based on what he's read, Harry adds Conklin's campaign manager, Gordon Mittel, to his list of suspects. For other police-related information, Harry isn't above 'borrowing' Harvey Pound's identity to acquire it. However, just because a case is over thirty years old doesn't mean the investigation will be safe - least of all when important people are involved.  <br /> <br />As with Connelly's previous books, I found this to be a very enjoyable book - and it deals with the very case I had wondered about. It's probably better, though not strictly necessary, to read the books in order. The 'newcomer' won't feel left out, as this book covers enough of Bosch's past to tell the story without any gaps. However, reading the previous books and getting to know the 'full story' will add to the enjoyment of this instalment. The other books (\\"The Black Echo\\", \\"The Black Ice\\" and \\"The Concrete Blonde\\") are very enjoyable also - reading them will be anything other than a burden ! <br />
B000002C1W|5.0|For all the people complaining that 'this isn't floyd', then I ask you:  What is?  Their peak as a band was 71-75 (Meddle - Wish You Were Here), but that still leaves 67-70 and 76-94.  Their sound and style has changed so much over the 27 years that they were active that it's nigh impossible to find a floyd album that you don't like.  Three 'frontmen' (Barrett, Waters, Gilmour) with radically different songwriting skills and talents - same band.  Amazing. <br /> <br />This is a pop album, that is true.  Gilmour, free to do what he wants for the first time in years, soars on this album and gives it a 'floydian-pop' feel.  It's more of a Floyd album than 'The Final Cut' is, and at the same time it's that albums complete opposite.  Waters songwriting talents are missed here - Some of Gilmours lyrics really suck.  On The Turning Away's lyrics are far too blunt and clichd for my liking, but it features amazing arrangements with an absolutely killer guitar solo. <br /> <br />Speaking of guitars, if you even have a marginal interest in them this is the album for you.  Gilmour's guitar soars like a phoenix from the ashes of 'the final cut' and is undeniably powerful at times.  Some of the best solos i've ever heard are present on this album, with On The Turning Away, Yet Another Movie, and Sorrow being the best of them.  The A New Machine  - Terminal Frost medley is quite enjoyable, although it is my least favourite moment of the album.  The Dogs of War would be almost completely forgettable if it weren't for Gilmours angry vocals and the incredible sax solo that emerges midway through the song. <br /> <br />Musically, this album is a triumph, but it is primarily a floyd-pop album.  I highly recommend this album to anybody, floyd-fan or not.   The band could survive without someone as influential as Waters, and this album proves it.
0792833201|3.0|For the 80's this was a pretty good movie with some cool special effects for its time. Also it was one of the first ghost movies that was scary and interesting. But now its 2004... and unless you're a kid under 12, I really can't  see anything about this movie thats gonna truely scare you. The movie has some suspenseful moments and eerieness to it. However the movie has such a fictional feel to it that I cant picture anyone aside from a child losing any sleep or feeling disturbed or frightened. I cant understand why this movie got an R rating. All in all a good scary movie for kids 12 and under.
B000000OU4|5.0|Get it. I preffered it to 'The Road To You'. The thumping title track, The Girls next Door, To The End Of The World and Stranger In Town will leave you wanting for more. <br /> <br />Episode D'Azure is simply special :-) <br /> <br />Sure, this album is a lot more \\"mainstream\\" then most Pat stuff - but the risk has paid off. This is one satisfied customer, encouraging you to enjoy the experience as well.
B000002U8G|5.0|Although I think WYWH and DSOFTM were better albums, Meddle is a must need. From One of These Days to Echoes, it is pure genious. One of These Days is a sweet song, with great bass playing from Waters and just a great classic Pink Floyd song. Then comes A Pillow Of Winds. It is a sad song, but is peaceful. Then comes Fearless, which is awesome. An acoustic song, it highlights the talents of Pink Floyd in 1971. Next comes San Tropez, an all-time favorite of mine. It's funny, and happy, and just makes me want to smile every time i hear it. Next is Seamus, which doesnt really fit in the cd, but hey, i still like it. Then comes Pink Floyd's best song ever, and one of the best songs ever made: Echoes. At 23 minutes, it covers a wide spectrum, and is just truly amazing.  <br /> <br />This is an album everyone needs to own!!!!! This is good music unlike the crap today.
B000021XS0|3.0|This is my first (and likely only) Dream Theater album. Dream Theater is widely considered one of prog-metal's flagship bands, and there is some basis for this--they have mounds of talent. John Petrucci is an excellent guitarist, Mike Portnoy is one of the top-rated drummers in the world, John Myung is certainly no slouch as a bassist, and Jordan Rudess is a whiz behind the keyboards.<br /><br />So these guys know their musical theory inside and out, and are experts behind their respective instruments. However, being extremely talented does not make a band interesting. Consider Yngwie Malmsteem, for instance, or the whole of Yes. And being talented does not necessarily make you \\"progressive.\\" Like Yes and Malmsteem (along with many other bands labeled \\"prog\\") Dream Theater get talent confused with mindless self-indulgence and showing off.<br /><br />I have nothing against technical music; I listen a lot to Dillinger Escape Plan and Spiral Architect, VERY complex stuff. The difference is that the focus is on ensemble playing. The aforementioned bands don't waste time on excess soloing. Dream Theater, on the other hand, treats almost every long track as an instrumental showcase, which gets boring quickly. We get it, guys--you're excellent technicians. But where's the songwriting? Concept albums should be characterized by excellent songwriting, and the songs here, when all the flashy jamming is subtracted, are average at best.<br /><br />Sometimes it sounds like these guys are trying way too hard to ape the prog sounds of the '70s and '80s, with Jordan Rudess' cheesy synth sounds and Wakeman-esque solos, and John Petrucci's tired guitar hero antics. Meh. For me the rhythm work here is a lot more interesting, with Portnoy nailing every odd time signature thrown at him. Too bad Myung is pretty much devoted to being a session player; I love bass leads, and the few bass leads here are incredible. He's also a very solid backing to all the dissassociated noodling going on around him. Myung deserves better than this prima donna outfit.<br /><br />Then there's James Labrie. While his drama-queen voice would probably be fine in the context of a straight melodic prog band, Labrie does not fit at all here. He lays the cheese on real thick for those ballads (Through My Eyes, The Spirit Carries On), where his wimpy crooning and overdramatic prescence quickly become annoying. Not only that, Labrie typically has to resort to vocal distortion to serve the heavier, darker songs. He can't keep up with the faster sections either, where the rest of the band tends to drown him out. Basically this band begs for a more visceral vocalist--someone in the vein of Geoff Tate, perhaps?<br /><br />Now, to evaluate Scenes From A Memory as a concept album. The lyrics? Not very good. Operation: Mindcrime is much better, and up against Quadrophenia or The Wall it's not even close. The band has even said themselves that the concept was pretty much an afterthought (being derived from Metropolis Pt. 1 off the earlier Images And Words), and that the fans talked them into doing it. And the voice acting and ambient sounds thrown in to make the whole affair sound \\"concept-like\\" are stiff, forced, and unnatural.<br /><br />Based on all of the above you'd think I hate Dream Theater. I don't. But don't let the band's rabid fans make you think that this is the only worthy band in the genre. Try Opeth, Spiral Architect, Ephuel Duath, Zero Hour, Devin Townsend, and Agalloch. All of them combine solid songwriting and real progressive leanings with their excellent technical abilities and excise most of the self-indulgence that Dream Theater appears to have embraced.es better than this prima donna outfit.

B000089CJI|5.0|With Jimmy Tamberello and Ben Gibbard matching up for this album, it was well worth the anticipation.  Tamberello topped himself on these tracks.  Ben Gibbard's vocals are a very warming addition to everything.  It's not too often that I will hear something and immediately stop and feel like the wind was knocked out of my lungs.  Very heart warming lyrics and music that will linger in your soul.  Postal Service is easily one of the best things I've ever heard.  I can't seem to take it out of my CD player.  So if you're looking for something refreshing, listen to this.  Better yet, just get to the store and buy it right now.  You won't regret it!
B0002OERI0|4.0|With bands like Green Day, who have been coming out with alternative albums for over a decade, it's really tough to get that balance between \\"something new\\" and \\"familiar.\\" Green Day's job is even harder, as they are so notorious for always sounding the same. I'm not so sure how this album does at being a rock-opera or a political event, as it is hyped to be, but I can say that Green Day has done a great job of offering something new and still being Green Day. <br /> <br />Let's be honest- their alleged opuses are just a bunch of 2 minute songs strung together. The lyrics are following the same storyline, but that goes for the album as a whole. What they have done here is no more impressive than their sequiter into Longview 10 years ago. So we have an album with about 20 songs on it, and that gives them the opportunity to give their dibs to everyone. <br /> <br />\\"When September Ends\\" and a handful of others will cater to everyone who downloaded their acoustic singles off iTunes without listening to their old punk rock. \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" are their next singles (or should be), and \\"Letterbomb\\" and \\"Whatsername\\" are so reminiscent of pre-Dookie Green Day I could practically match them up to their early-90s counterparts. <br /> <br />The tradeoff, of course, is that no matter who you are, you'll be hard-pressed to enjoy this album from beginning to end. There are a few songs which I force myself to listen to simply because they help me enjoy the story, but you'll never catch me skipping to them on purpose. But that's the price to pay for having to cater to millions of fans. Personally, I figure they tailor-made me an album with Kerplunk, and I'm just grateful that they didn't forget their old ways in making this politically ambitious album.
6304240554|4.0|this horror film has 4 people shacked up in a mall surviving the multiplying outspread of zombie effecting. delivers the goods with full on gore and nail biting situations, though I didnt bite my nails, but you get my drift, I hope. the script is awesome and the zombies are dead on perfect. hoorah for George A. Romero for pulling off this goodie. some scenes may turn some stomachs so this is just a warning. Tom Savini is one of the actors in the movie. Savini did all the zombie effects in all Romero's zombie films, except the original Night Of The Living Dead. hope you make it out alive (evil laugh)
068987474X|4.0|I'm normally not a reader of self-help books, but the whole theory behind this one had me hooked.  Ladies, if you have been wondering if he loves you/loves you not, here's your foolproof chance to find out.  Handy checklists, his and her opinions, and real-life scenarios make this book a fun as well as insightful read.  You'll find yourself thinking, \\"Hey! I've heard that line before!\\" and life and love will both make a little bit more sense.<br /><br />This book can't tell you how to get the love of your life.  But hopefully after reading it, you will be able to wade through the riff-raff a little more easily.
B000001DWG|5.0|This is one of the best bands ever, but also one of the most obscure bands ever which is too bad. MLB crank out some of the most beefiest hard rockin tunes this side of the 70's! Andrew Wood was Robert Plant's bastard child, the man could scream and howl like the legendary Zeppelin frontman himself! Combine that with crunching riffs, mind warping solos and an excellent rythm section and you have one great rock band! The sole reason most people have never discovered their obscure masterpiece album Stardog Champion is due to leadsinger/songwriter Andrew Wood's death in 1990. Most people dont realize it but consequently due to Wood's death another great band formed, Pearl Jam! Future Jammers Stone and Gossard left MLB after Wood's death and the band broke up and joined vocalist Eddie Vedder to make Pearl Jam! Wood, despite being undiscovered was very much missed by his ex-members and other future superstars, Vedder and Chris Cornell(Soundgarden, Audioslave)that they formed a one trick band named Temple of the Dog and recorded a self titled album in rememberance of Wood. MLB is the most classic rock oriented of all the grunge bands that came out in the late 80's and early 90's. If you enjoy Zeppelin and glam rockers like Bowie but also with a touch of the hardcore fuzz of the grunge genre then this would definitley strike your fancy!
B00005JN7O|4.0|Within the first fifteen minutes of Sky Captain, I was in. Gigantic robots swarm New York City and stomp through the streets, Gwenyth Paltrow as Polly Perkins does a pitch-perfect emulation of those 1930's newspaper gals, and the whole movie has the feel of the best old sci-fi movie never made. I felt like a five-year-old again; not in that still-eating-paste sense, but because something on the screen was so boldly exciting I nearly leapt out of my seat and applauded. No freaking joke. Needless to say, the rest of Sky Captain never really reaches the level of invigoration that its slam-bang opener achieves (and yeah, it has a few slow moments), but it's still an accomplished, consistently interesting movie with enough in-jokes to keep film buffs satisfied (look for not only references to The Wizard of Oz, but a few Citizen Kane nods as well) and enough rip-roaring action for everyone else.  <br /> <br />          Sky Captain could have been an empty exercise just for the sake of a new filmmaking technique - I'm sure you know by now it was all done in front of a blue screen. What makes it so interesting, though, is how seriously everyone takes the whole endeavor. Jude Law effortlessly embodies the sarcastic, multi-talented everyman do-gooder; Gwenyth Paltrow delivers those one-liners in a way that Howard Hawks would be proud; Giovanni Ribisi steals his scenes like any faithful sidekick should; and the whole plot of the movie (which could have been a borderline parody) comes off as deadly serious. Don't let the blue-screen hesitation hold you back from this one; if you complain that they don't make 'em like they used to, here's proof that it's not always the case. B+ <br /> <br />

B000002AH7|5.0|This was the first Miles Davis album I had the chance to listen to, and really the first jazz album I ever listened to, and I was completely enthralled by it. It just seemed (and still seems) like such strange and beautiful music, and I still don't understand it. <br />I just wanted to post this review for anyone who isn't totally into jazz but respects it and would like to take the plunge. This was my first album and since I first heard this album I've fallen in love with jazz. This is very different from any album I've ever heard, much less a jazz album, so give it a try it you've ever found it hard to get into jazz. It's one of my very favorites.
B00005JNEU|4.0|Billy Bob Thorton is an actor that creates a rare psychological effect in the movies he makes. In his best roles (1998's A Simple Plan, 2001's Monster's Ball, this movie) he is so understated and so quietly graceful that the movie goes on around him and the awareness that a great actor is before us disappears. In Friday Night Lights, Thorton occupies such a low-key wavelength that I'm still wondering why he got that starring credit. It's a testament to the pitch-perfect casting of the film, and the wonderful young actors who play the roles, that any supporting player could have had his name in bold on the poster and it would have made sense. <br /> <br />          In Lights, Thorton is coach Gary Gaines, the mastermind behind the football juggernaut in Odessa Texas: the Permian Panthers. Gaines is at the head of a team with state championships under its belt, a gigantic reputation in its desolated surroundings, and a football stadium that dwarfs everything within miles of it. This is not Gaines' movie, though; Lights wisely focuses in on the young men who make up the team and the way their lives shape what goes into the game. The best performance of the movie belongs to quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), whose precise Texas drawl and shy personality make for a fascinating contrast with the louder guys on the team. Speaking of louder guys: there's Derek Luke of Antwone Fisher who plays Boobie Miles, the superstar of the team who gets a little life lesson of his own once the season begins. <br /> <br />          It's actual history, the fall of 1988, but David Aaron Cohen's adaptation of the book by H.G. Bissinger brings the inhabitants of the team and the town alive so that a real narrative progresses before your eyes. But the central idea behind Lights that you might have before seeing it is misleading: this is not a movie about a triumphant football team who starts a losing streak and has it all come down to a defining moment at state championships. Lights isa bittersweet tale of the disappointment, uncertainty, and occasional bleakness that accompanies a life totally consumed by a sport. The movie doesn't turn a head away from the fact that, yeah, some football players can't read really well (a particularly triumphant moment in my own mind :) ), they often go on to drive trucks and sell insurance instead of playing pro ball, and sometimes things are such a damn letdown you can't do anything but yank off your helmet and crash into a ball of heaving sobs. <br /> <br />          Friday Night Lights has moments of searing brilliance, propelled forward with an atmospheric musical score, but in the end it fails to make that final leap into greatness that it could have. I can't help but admire this film, though, for its bravery in the story that it has to tell. This is not the uplifting sports movie that will run over and over again on TBS a few years from now. This is a 'sports movie' that I thought about for quite a while after leaving the theater. With football, it seems it's all about winning; what Friday Night Lights makes us realize is that there's often more loss, in the very deepest sense of the word. B+ <br /> <br />
0786714875|5.0|Every once in a while you read something that not only leaves an impression on you, but also give you a whole new understanding of the \\"way the world works\\".   In \\"Shake Hands With The Devil\\", Romeo Dallaire gives us a surprisingly objective, yet very personal account of the events the took place in Rwanda.  It is not giving away the plot to acknowledge that 800,000 people were massacred in 100 days, all of this while \\"peacekeepers\\" were on the job. The \\"How and Why?\\" is what this book is about. Dallaire leaves out a lot of the drama that fiction readers love but gets on with the story. Shake Hands is documentary in nature and while the real drama was being there, the book remains very readable. <br /> <br />This one volume provides world insights that a 1000 five-minute news clips and time magazines will never come close to offering.  The reader will walk away from the experience with a totally different view of: the Canadian Military, The UN,  and the concept of \\"World Peace\\". Truly Dallaire puts these issues into clear perspective and gives us a timely foundation of knowledge for viewing and judging todays events. <br /> <br />Dallaire opens with a commentary and a brief family Bio, affording us an appreciation for his reference point. The real story is about the tragedy of Rwanda and the needlessness of it all. Politics, UN bureaucracy, racism and powerful international forces, are dealt with in an incredibly  unbiased manner.  Dallaire's argument is clear and direct yet he doesn't resort to finger pointing or slander to make the point. His experience is the explanation and the proof is irrefutable. The reader only needs to reflect on the whole situation to see the truth! <br /> <br />There is no question that Dallaire suffered tremendously from his experience in Rwanda. Originally, as scapegoats, he and his his colleagues were publicly discredited for their \\"weakness\\".  Later as professionals and humanitarians they have been exonerated for the real strength andcharacter they showed in the face of overwhelming nightmares. The media often focusses on this personal suffering as a priority in promoting this story. But what Dallaire professes and  reveals, so truthfully, is what little emphasis western society places on mass suffering and how greatly it focusses mass resources on the few. <br /> <br />Dallaire must be commended for his guts and tact in writing such an account. He puts our lives in perspective and humbles himself before the dead and dying. He is not afraid to look shame in the face and admit it for himself and for us.  In a time when popular culture glosses over the negative  with honey nut coating, Dallaire projects a collective need to stop denying world suffering and start sharing in the cost. This is not \\"Blackhawk Down\\", where hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to sensationalize the \\"bravery and human cost\\" of a few American lives lost to save a few American lives.  This is one mans account of the lack of value placed on millions of families in a forgotten part of the world and the few people that tried to do something about it...but couldn't. <br /> <br />What Dallaire tells us so clearly in his closing, is that the vast resources of our western society need only to be refocussed and put to good use. Perhaps this is the most important point he demonstrates to us. It takes people who care, to make a change for good in the world. A person of rare character and integrity, Romeo Dallaire speaks to a calling much greater than his own self. Spending on just cause is something we need not just to promote but support as well. <br /> <br />CB
B00005MP58|5.0|I own the Greer Garson-Laurence Olivier version, the earlier BBC version, and this version of Pride and Prejudice. And while I like all three, this version is by far the best because of the great chemistry between Colin Firth's Darcy and Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth. Ehle's Elizabeth does have a dash more sass than the literary Elizabeth, but that sass is needed to take on the imposing and indignant portayal of Firth's Darcy. And the result is wonderful-you can cut the sensual tension between the two with a knife and you really get why Darcy, such naturally prideful person, falls so hard for her. He has obviously met his match! The best scene in the whole movie is when Elizabeth covers for Darcy's sister when she gets flustered over the mentioning of Wickam, and Darcy and Elizabeth just stare at eachother with longing and respect for eachother.  I think the addition of this scene was great because it conveys the fact that Darcy understands what a one in a million gal Elizabeth is while Elizabeth realizes all the responsibility that Darcy shouldered all these years and that's why he's a little anal retentive and stiff. Great, great adaption of a great, great book!

0767827902|5.0|There are a handful of movies in history that can be summed up by the look in a character's eyes (Renee Falconetti's horrified stare in The Passion of Joan of Arc, Al Pacino's steely gaze in The Godfather Part II), and within five minutes of Peter Bogdonavich's controversial 1971...yes...masterpiece, I knew I'd have another one to add to the list. The Last Picture Show is wickedly funny, raunchy, and razor-sharp precise in capturing that post-Senior-year-summer state of mind, but the heartbreaking, jaded look on Timothy Bottoms' face hit me like a ton of bricks, and I'm still somewhat recovering from it. <br /> <br />          Show takes place between World War II and the Korean Conflict in the sleepy, dying town of Anarene, Texas. Robert Surtees' camera wisely captures the desolated-yet-beautiful aura of the place in an opening shot that glides down a dusty street, past the movie theater, and into the complex lives of a bunch of horny high school students, nosy townspeople, and Anarene's one pillar of nobility, Sam the Lion. It's really difficult to even believe that Show wasn't made in the 1950's, when the film takes place. The stark, black-and-white cinematography is far-removed from Willis' lush images in Manhattan, but it's not quite low-budget gritty, either. It's mostly owed to shooting on location in the town that inspired Larry McMurtry's source novel, but the authenticity of a now-notable cast's performances elevates this to a class all by itself. <br /> <br />          Do Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Randy Quaid ring a bell at all? In 1971, all were virtual unknowns, and - sadly enough - the giver of the greatest performance in the film, Timothy Bottoms as Sonny, remained virtually so. McMurtry and Bogdonavich's script takes these horny teens and jaded adults and creates a lurid entanglement of sexual liasons, secrets, and naked pool parties that would have Jerry Springer shaking his head. And this would all be patently ridiculous if it weren't for the fact that each and every character has a complexity that makes their actions completely plausible.  <br /> <br />          And that's the brilliant thing about Bogdonavich's film. He isn't exploiting the closed-door actions and flippant erotic gestures of these messed-up denizens of a rapidly dying town; he understands that everything they do, everything we did at that age, was all a result of the confusion, denial, and pure terror at the life that lies ahead for us all. There's a reason that the movie focuses on the adults in the town, as well: Jacy's mom, coach Popper's wife, Sam the Lion - these people used to be Sonny, Duane, and Jacy at one time, and their hopes and dreams were put on hold just to live comfortably and safely in Anarene. <br /> <br />          Timothy Bottoms' Sonny is the guiding force of Picture Show; the character there from the first frame and at the cusp of true reality in its last. Sure, he has his share of American Pie-esque moments (an affair with his coach's wife rings a bell), but it's the bulk of the emotion of the film that falls on him. A deeply sad moment, in particular, lingered with me: a person in the town has just died, and he's riding along in a car, gazing out the window, looking at a distant Texas lake that means more to him than he knows. His eyes seem to take it all in until it's too much, and a tear falls from each cheek without the others even knowing. <br /> <br />          A line that completely bowled me over is said to Sonny, as well, and it's proof of the screenplay's perfect hold on the language that we use. Who knows how to put a life-changing experience into the right words? Burstyn's Lois doesn't, and so we get this haunting gem of a line: \\"I guess if it wasn't for Sam, I'd have missed it, whatever it is.\\" <br /> <br />          The adult residents of Anarene did miss it, whatever it was. But this film holds on to a group of people we learn to love, struggle with hating, and eventually don't want to leave, all because we don't want to see them miss whatever it is. The Last Picture Show is one of the most deeply haunting, brutally funny, and real moviewatching experiences I've ever had. I'm glad I didn't miss it, whatever it is. A+ <br /> <br />
0446677450|1.0|Just like everyone else i was pleased with the amount of helpful info that the author was giving. At least that was my initial perception. Here's the real problem i have with the author: in his books he never mentions what companies or corporations he is/was involved. He keeps on preaching Real Estate, but if you do some research you find out that his true income comes from the books that he sells. The background check also states that the book is more fiction than anything else( so please dont give me the garbage of the TRUE STORY of rich dad and poor dad).
0553381709|5.0|As the title of my review states, A Song of Ice & Fire is absolutely the most thrilling series I have ever read. Oh, I've read countless fantasy/Sci-fi sagas over the years, by authors such as Jordan, Margaret Weis & Tracey Chapman, Tad Williams (Otherland is brilliant), Stephen Donaldson, Ursula LeGuin, Asinov, and the list goes on and on.......... But, I am completely addicted and riveted by this series. I simply can't consume it enough to satisfy me. George R.R. Martin has despelled the deriviative fantasy genre and written a series of heartwrenching beauty and destruction. I actually whimpered when some key characters were murdered. Who else would have had the courage to do something like that, most likely assuming that readers would be turned off completely? He did it, and I raptly continued reading the novels with hope for the rest of the struggling heroes. I am believer of redemption and Martin incorporated it wonderfully into the story. Yes, this is mature reading material not suitable for the squeamish or for the fairy tale lovers. The characters are earthy and realistic displaying all the faults and redeeming qualities of the human race. A Song of Ice & Fire is phenomenal, truly told.    Now,........hurry up with the Fourth book already, Martin! :)
068987474X|5.0|I read the book after a messy breakup and it really did help me understand why men are the way they are.  However, I happened to see an article in the October issue of \\"Psychology Today\\" about compatibility.  Two things made me see things even clearer: 1. there are low stimulation and high stimulation people (my ex is the low and I am the high) and 2. scent, especially if you are taking the birth control pill, has a lot to do with attraction, which explains why I wasn't attracted to my ex-husband anymore (among other things, of course!).
B00030590I|2.0|There is a scene deep into Yimou Zhang's Hero that burns with inspiration. A warrior bent on assassinating the king of the kingdom of Qin, Broken Sword, enters the chambers of His Majesty and begins a violent assault for which the king is well-equipped. The two men battle with a ferocious intensity, unencumbered by excessive slow-motion or flying effects, while huge tapestries of lime green plunge to the ground like majestic birds shot to their deaths. The scene has suspense, it has intensity, it has life...and unfortunately, that's the only time you'll find those things in the 96-but-feels-like-200 minutes of Hero. <br /> <br />          Which is kind of shocking, considering the movie starts out with such a promising fanfare. Against a slowly forming background, we learn of the history of China 2000 years ago: how it was divided into kingdoms, how they all fought with each other, and how one king attempted to bring it all to a close. Unfortunately, being a king and all, a lot of people want his ass dead, so the poor dude can't get any sleep. Finally, though, a nameless warrior ends His Majesty's worries by wiping out the three deadliest assassins and the king wants to hear his story. Nameless (Jet Li) proceeds, guided by a rather nice panoramic shot, to the chamber of the king and rests 100 paces from him, with the promise to advance paces at the king's behest. So he begins his story, and the framing device of the film is set up. If Hero had remained in that room with Nameless and the king, it would work. There is a message about honor, about duty, and about patriotism that arises from the film's present-tense frame that I found intriguing in parts. Of course, it would only last about 15 minutes if it did that, but as of now, I'd take that over the pure, shameless tripe that gets slung during the flashbacks. <br /> <br />          Hero is a perfect case of simply trying too hard. The first flashback of Nameless' murder of the first assassin, Sky, culminates in a dull battle overstuffed with relentless slow-mo, Matrix-esque bullet-time effects, and - but of course - Crouching Tiger flying. I don't have anything against martial arts; I think it's a compelling art that has created some enjoyable cinema. Director Zhang, though, doesn't seem to think that the existence of the violence itself is enough, though, and he insists on hampering it with special-effects flourishes, one after the other. It's tiring, uninspired, and - worse yet - kinda boring. <br /> <br />          The film moves on to the next stage of Nameless' quest, in which he must get rid of the last two assassins, lovers Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Slowly but surely, Hero reveals itself as what it truly is: an ultra-expensive movie that disguises its vapidity in a frame story with echoes of themes done 100 times before, and 100 times better in other movies. One of the more unnerving aspects of the film is its presentation of metaphors. Instead of subtle gestures that even a semi-stupid audience would get, things like \\"music is like sword-fighting,\\" and \\"calligraphy is like sword-fighting\\" are written into the script and said multiple times! Even the visual beauty of the film gets old: cinematographer Christopher Doyle (who so brilliantly photographed Phillip Noyce's Quiet American and Rabbit-Proof Fence) drenches the set pieces in a single color scheme for really no other point than to look pretty.  <br /> <br />          And I'm sorry, call me old-fashioned, but this crap just comes across as silly. I'm not a huge fan of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I don't really remember unintentionally laughing at some of the flying scenes. Ang Lee's film created that visual as a kind of extension of the characters' abilities: the characters of Tiger seemed so skilled that it just seemed logical that they could defy gravity. Hero just seems like it had extra money and some strings hanging around. <br /> <br />          There is a decent message (trite as it may be) hidden deep within the film, and when the plot opens wider into a Rashomon-like angle, Hero has brief moments of narrative intelligence. In fact, a scene following many of the flashbacks, in which an important revelation about the king's fate is made, is flat-out well-done. It's all lost, though, in the endless, pointless exercise of style that consumes the bulk of the film. Hero is far from heroic; it borrows from so many other movies, I'd go as far as to call it a wimp. C- <br />
B0002TT0NW|3.0|there was a few things i liked about this movie and others i didnt like ... im a big fan of the books .... at first i didnt like the costume change coz it looks stupid but i kindda like the uniforms now ... but i seen pictures from the new movie and they've changed the uniform back 2 the old way (thats really stupid) the new dumbledore wasnt that bad ... i didnt like the way they put things in it that wasnt even in the book ... i agree with some of the other reviews that it was a silly ending and the backround was diffrent ... what a strange film
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie is amazing.  I love movies, and in particular movies like this.  This movie is one of the most touching and moving pieces of art I have had the pleasure of sitting down and enjoying.  It is not hollywood- it doesn't show you the cute falling in love part- it shows the real part.  The decay of a relationship and how love can over come that and how second chances are just as important as first ones.  The acting is superb, and the storyline is moving and beautiful.  I think movies have the ability to stick with a viewer and impact their lives- this movie sticks with you because it is just beautiful... and if it doesn't stick with you... for two hours you will be entertained.. and in the end isn't that what we are all looking for.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|Camel have been around for quite a while and their last album \\"Rajaz\\" was excellent, but this new release is so much better. It evokes England in a way that has not been done for many years (perhaps since \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" by Genesis). The guitar work on this album is exquisite and all the songs are superb. A real return to form for Camel. This album is dedicated to the late Pete Bardens - it's a wonderful compliment. The last track \\"For Today\\" is really lovely and has a terrific guitar solo that is worthy of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour. I just love this album.
B00005JKGO|5.0|It would be easy to write off the movie that launched Federico Fellini to international acclaim as a decadent feast of glamour and vanity that adds up to little (the textbook for my film class does just so). If you did so, though, you'd be robbing Fellini's best, most complex, and most deeply moving film of everything it deserves. A first viewing of Vita was enough to convince me that it's a brilliant film; after seeing it again this weekend I'm kind of humbled at its very existence. Here is a movie that, for nearly three hours, holds you for dear life and then has you wanting it to go on at the credits. Here is a movie that has moments of oddball  recklessness and quiet beauty, both deliriously gorgeous; one that puts its protagonist through hell and back but still gives him hope. Yeah, I could tell you a plot synopsis (gossip columnist (Marcello Mastrioanni) experiences the night life of Rome), but that would be cheating and wouldn't do it justice. La Dolce Vita, though about vanity and emptiness, is a movie of ideas. I've been thinking about it all day, I think I know what he's saying, and I just want to experience it again. And what an experience: the cinematography is graceful (not a handheld shot to be found), the performances surrounding that of Mastrioanni are gleefully over-the-top (look for Nico, of Warhol's 'Factory,' near the end), and the conclusion to which the film inexorably builds is as powerful as it is ambiguous. Yes, 8 1/2 is an interesting film, but its pretention gets in the way. Sure, La Strada and I Vitelloni are wonderful little neo-realistic works, but they seem to just hint at something on the horizon for the director. This is it, the Fellini movie that is perfect in every way. With La Dolce Vita, Italy's most beloved director shows he belongs in the same breath as The Bicycle Thief and The Passion of Joan of Arc when we talk about the best foreign films ever made. A+ <br />
B00005JLEU|5.0|i first heard of this film on film 2001 johnathan ross said U MUST SEE THIS MOVIE and ever since i've been going down my local video store and saying 'im gonna rent that when i get the money' but i never did ... untill a couple of weeks ago i decided i will ... and i wasnt disapointed i thought it was a awesome film and now i bought it ... i loved it every anime fan should have this movie in their collection :-)
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill VOl 2 is the perfect extension to Vol 1.  In 1 we see the revenge aspect  ie: the blood and gore, amazing fight scenes, and of course dismemberment.  In Vol 2 we are introduced to the sensitivity the emotional aspects of this great story.  We become emotionally connected to these characters and we are no longer blood hungry... but we want to know more about these people.  In Vol 2 the viewer gets to see how and why things were the way they in Vol 1.  The story, essentially, comes full circle- providing the viewer with a complete story instead of two hours of gore.  Watch these movies back to back and see how different they are and how equally great they are.  I would give the Kill Bills all the stars in the sky if I could!
0385508417|5.0|I prefer light reads as opposed to John Grisham's usual legal/mystery novels, so Skipping Christmas is his only book I have ever bothered to read. It's been a few years now since I read it and the only reason I'm bothering to review it now is because I just learned that it's being made into a movie! When I finished reading this book I told everyone what an excellent holiday movie it would make. I'm so glad that is finally happening! Although, I'm not going to jump the gun on that... I know that I often hope that books I've read will be adapted to the screen and I end up hating the movie because they never seem to do the book justice. Hopefully it will be different this time.<br /><br />At any rate, this book is highly recommended if you're looking for a light Christmas read that will give you many laugh-out-loud moments!
B00005JNH0|4.0|As much as I love Sam Jones' I Am Trying To Break Your Heart, a transcendent 90-minute documentary on the making of Wilco's masterpiece, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, I know where the audience for the movie stops. And that's this: if you don't enjoy Wilco, you're probably not going to enjoy the movie half as much as an obsessive fan like myself would. Well, I have a confession to make about Metallica that probably won't come as a surprise to anyone who knows me: if presented with the choice of a root canal without anesthesia and one track off any of their albums, I'd run to the dentist. <br /> <br />          So imagine my surprise when I found myself pretty damn engrossed in Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky's newest film, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster. Here's a documentary with nothing to prove (f*** you, Fahrenheit 9/11), no emotional baggage to put on you (Capturing the Friedmans), and no birds (Winged Migration) - only a nice little story about a band stuck in a rut that never really seems to get out of it. <br /> <br />          In 2001, the most popular metal band of modern rock was completely on the skids (well, if you believe they ever weren't). Their bass player walked, lead singer James Hetfield continued his addiction to alcohol, and drummer Lars Ulrich nursed a crippling fetish for bad sweat pants. Enter: Phil Towle, a group therapist paid $40,000 a month to work with the guys and make sure they stay in a room together without killing each other. <br /> <br />          This sounds pretty far-fetched and funny, and I assure you, it is. Towle is a complete joke, and the band alternates between idolizing him (\\"Phil has been my angel,\\" Hetfield says at one point - deadly serious) and realizing that he's a joke. One scene in particular, where the band tries to drop Towle, plays great on many levels: Hetfield and the band never really rise above \\"You're out of the band!\\" childishness, but Towle pulls out \\"You need me\\" psychology, in a desperate attempt to stay withthem. And you wanna talk funny? Metallica also begins work on St. Anger, an album finally released to middling reviews but - to the ear of this reviewer - downright awful. The funniest parts of the movie are Hetfield's attempts to pin lyrics to the music; I was left longing for \\"Sex Farm.\\" <br /> <br />          Sinofsky and Berlinger are fantastic filmmakers, though, and there is a level of gravitas to the movie that hits you on poignant levels quite unexpectedly. Ulrich seems to really make genuine attempts to reconcile Metallica's lost stardom with its causes, one can't help but feel a little for Hetfield in his rehab struggles, and the long-buried issues involving other kicked-out members really shine a light on the band's current situation. And really, a lot of Some Kind of Monster is like watching a fish flopping out of water. The underlying message I got was that Metallica was toast before they even began St. Anger, so each rehearsal, each therapy session feels like a haphazard attempt to hold something together that's already fallen apart. <br /> <br />          My only problem with Metallica: Some Kind may come from the fact that I hate the band. It's a two-hour-long movie, and that's a long time to spend watching recovering alcoholics, ego-maniacs, and whiney ex-members attempt to get to the root of Metallica's rut. And depending on how cynical you are, it might be a little difficult conjuring any kind of connection with a bunch of rich guys who would be better off retiring to some island and not punishing themselves by creating lame albums for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br />          But throw your cynicism away, and Some Kind of Monster is a masterfully edited mini-epic that turns garbage into gold and isn't afraid to tackle complexity. In any group, the dynamics change and change, and Sinofsky and Berlinger, chopping 1200 hours of footage into 2, coherently show the arc that ran through the two years they spent with the band. You gotta admire that, even if you do hate Metallica. B <br /> <br />
B00006ZXSK|3.0|When I saw this movie for the first time, I guess I fell in love with it right away. Sure it airs again on television, but I always catch it somewhere towards the middle or the end. Ruins the whole feel of a good movie. <br /> <br />That's why I'm going to get this movie on DVD as soon as I save enough money for it. When you do order this movie, I strongly suggest you get the family together, and sit down with a big bowl of popcorn, and lots of soda. I know after you watch this, you forget all the troubles you've had that day, and remember how Danielle found love at long last.
B00005JMEW|5.0|What can you say about a movie that is just enthralling from the moment you push play to the moment it ejects.  Greatness!  Kill Bill is an homage to all those crazy martial movies we love to hate... but I find myself not hating this gorefest... I love it!  Amazing!  Notice this review is full of positive adjectives... Kill Bill Vol 1 is a woman's revengeful rampage, and the sensitive mushy stuff is left for the dogs.  The action and fighting is awesome... big budgets do help sometimes!  Uma is outstading as per usual and Kill Bill VOl 1 will go down as an absolute classic!  I know movies and this is a great one.. yeah violence isn't the answer nor revenge.  But after watching this flick I am pro revenge just on a much lighter scale... much much lighter!
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I am absolutely obsessed with Gilmore girls. I watch every new episode religiously (whilst taping it, so I can immediately watch the highlights again once it's over.) There is a sign posted on my bedroom door saying \\"Do not disturb between hours of 9-10 Wednesday nights (I have Global, not the WB) on pain of death.\\" Yeah. So anyways, I think you get the extent of how much I love this show.  <br />I have seen all of season two before, and let me tell you, it is definetly a great season. I am counting down the days till this release. I don't know the quality of this particular set, but I'm going to expect it to be the same as season one. The picture is good, clarity is good, and the packaging is SUPERB. There are six discs in total, with four episodes on each disc. The last disc contains two episodes and special features. I haven't watched the special features yet, but it looks to be much better than season one - a \\"Film by Kirk\\" is reason enough to buy the DVDs!  <br />I have watched these episodes twice each at least, and I'm still eagerly awaiting the arrival of this DVD. <br />
B000003TA4|4.0|Hey, I like Nirvana, they, although not the first grunge band, did help to establish a good portion of the early and mid 90's views on music. They help set the bar for new bands trying to make it in the buisness. as for you avril, I bet you have never listened to any of the music that you are putting down, Avril is not Punk at all, I mean give me a break, if she lost the band and changed her clothes, she would be britney spears, another pop princess. as for good charrlote being the grand fathers of punk, you just prove your ignorance, the true Grand Daddys are the clash and the sex pistols, and if you can't think that far back with your narrow mind, what about bands like greenday, and offspring? I bet you don't even know who they are. then you say thay ST. Anger was mettallica's best album, now I'm hurt. it was the worst. try listening to master of puppets or ride the lightning, even the black album for god sakes, I mean st. anger? please. and there would not even be any of this music if it were not for people like bach and motzart, and betoven, as for limp bizcut being the creators of metal, that is very uneducated, they are not even metal, it is more like angry rock. Bands like rage, breaking benjamin, and korn fit this catagory, I like some of it, but biscut sucks hard no matter what. I look at your philosophy on music and I think I have figured you out, you even contradict yourself. you think anything new is good, and anything old is bad, or at least anything that wasn't made before 1990. then you say anything on trl is good. this is known as conformity, you agree with whatever makes you cool. try finding who you really are, I mean conformity is everything punk is against. I also see that you are going bush cheny '04, me too, but do you know how democratic MTV is? you slip up to many times for anyone to yake you seriously. long story short, buy this album, it rocks.
0345350499|4.0|Well, well, well.  I admit when I started this book I was a bit skeptical-- \\"A King Arthur story told from the women's point of view?  How can you do that and still reflect medieval attitudes?\\"    I have to say, however, that Bradley pulled it off extremely well. <br /> <br />First off, the disclaimer: I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, a 'romance' person.  I generally run away from romance novels like I run away from extremely large, scary crocodiles.   That being said, The Mists of Avalon is, in point of fact, a romance.  And a good one.   <br /> <br />Set in the time period when Christianity is just beginning to replace the 'Old Ways', the book is essentially a power-struggle between the major players, all of whom are female, with a bit of love story thrown in between the men and women.  The insipid, asinine, but also beautiful and probably well-intentioned Gwenyhfar, who holds such sway over Arthur and Lancelet, and who manages to use her influence to increase everyone's general Christian piety, completely unaware of the damage she's doing the kingdom, and the likewise beautiful (but differently so), Morgaine, (Morgan le Fey), who is a priestess of the old pagan traditions and who tries to use her power for the betterment of all and in preservation of their traditional religion. <br /> <br />Love triangles, rituals, accidental incest, angst and strong women of all shapes and sizes abound in this complex, richly fulfilling epic, and really one of the few complaints that has any merit whatsoever is that the men here often seem like nothing more than puppets.  They are often not as well-rounded and finely-drawn as the women, which I suspect has something to do with the fact that the main character is a woman, and therefore cannot understand men perfectly.  It does, however, seem kind of femmenazi at points due to the lack of men who are the women's equals.  Ironically, the strongest male character is probably Kevin, a crippled Druid whose main talent is not war but the harp. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fabulously engaging novel that is a definite page-turner without being an action-adventure story.  Expect to come out of it, if you're a woman, feeling vindicated and empowered.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Turn on the Bright Lights has practicaly blown me away everytime I listen to it.  I love it more and more with every listen.  To name some of the great things about this CD is it is amazingly catchy, you find yourself singing along to every song.  Even though it is very catchy it is also accompanied by some very intelligent lyrics.  Another great thing about this band is they have pretty unique style.  There aren't many bands who are playing dark post-punk, right now but this CD has already spawned a bit of a post-punk movement. <br /> <br />This is one of the most classic albums of the last decade, if you are a big music fan you should own this CD.
0060934719|4.0|Neil Gaiman holds an undisputed position as one of today's best and most versatile fantasy authors, and in 'Stardust', he once again demonstrates his talent, this time with a charming, almost straight-up fairytale for people of every age.<br /><br />The story opens, unusually, with the main character's father, Dunstan Thorn, in the town of Wall, and the introduction to the people and the world, and the story of Tristan's conception under somewhat mysterious circumstances.  This is one of the few quote-unquote 'adult' parts of the book: a sex scene that isn't really a sex scene unless you know what's going on.<br /><br />The book then continues with Tristan, Dunstan's son, and his adventures past the wall that gives the town of Wall its name and into the realm of Faery.  Gaiman puts his usual spin on this-- some of the events are actually quite disturbing and macabre, although none of them measure up to the horror elements in, say, 'American Gods'-- and Tristan does of course meet a fabulously interesting cast of characters, including a fallen star, a unicorn, several witches, a small unidentified hairy man, and other fantastic creatures. Filled with children's rhyme allusions, ships that sail the clouds, heroic deeds and characters that are more complex than they appear at first, Gaiman's first attempt into the realm of the traditional fairytale is a respectable foray with a twist all its own.  While not as wildly inventive or gripping as 'Neverwhere' or as funny as 'Good Omens', it is the quintessential 'curl up under the covers', 'have a hot cup of tea' book, just perfect for a snowy day.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Please be responsible and research why so many people/journalists are saying that this movie is so deceitful.  I've seen this movie and researched the facts, read the reports and have come to the conclusion that Moore is trying to fool all of you into believing these lies.  Search on google for \\"59 deceits in fahrenheit 911\\", Kopel put together a comprehensive list of deceits backed up with facts.  I pointed this site out to one of my misguided leftist friends and he said he felt \\"duped\\" by Fahrenheit 9/11.  And be fair, watch FahrenHYPE 9/11 as well and then make up your mind.  If you don't like Bush then at least have some intelligent arguments, don't be another ignorant person falling for Moore's lies while he makes a half a billion dollars worldwide.
B0000026NC|3.0|The \\"live\\" post Waters release of Pulse is a much better sounding release than this live release.  As I said in a previous review of Pulse, Gilmour seems to be at his best vocally on Pulse, the sound quality is good, and they do the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" album.  I have both this release and Pulse and I would recommend Pulse over the Delicate Sound of Thunder.
B00005JMUL|3.0|I am a child therapist and recently viewed the trailer for \\"Polar Express\\" with my daughter (age 10).  We also saw cuts from the movie on Oprah.  My child said that the animated characters were \\"almost real looking - but kinda creepy\\" and due to that she doesn't want to see the movie.   <br />A few other children have made similar comments.  Apparently there is a line that animators can cross when their characters are almost too real. This is interesting in that the children I know enjoyed Toy Story.  <br />
B0000CD5FN|5.0|After hearing \\"Global A-Go-Go,\\" I was impressed, but I wasn't looking for a world mix this time. Imagine how pleased I was when the opening track, \\"Coma Girl\\" started out with Joe back at it.     As the guitars guide us to bounce our heads and tap our feet, Joe's lyrics paint a picture and take us away. \\"I was crawling through a festival way out west.\\" he calls, and we can see it. As he then sees the coma girl and as the rain sets in.    Many of the songs on this recording paint an image on us in the same way, in \\"Get Down Moses\\" as he shouts \\"Get down Moses, down here in the street / the blood is washing down all the gravel to our feet.\\"  With gritty sounds and images of the old punk scene (\\"Arms Aloft\\") or a quiet acoustic ballad that takes you far, far away, to a place where Jonney Cash and Strummer both cast a long shadow (\\"Long Shadow\\"): it's an album that gets to you.    Of course a stand out track remains Strummer's cover of Bob Marley's \\"Redemption Song.\\" As a heartfelt protest song, it takes wings in Sturmmer's deep, emotional voice. This recording Strummer may have sung with a political motive in mind, but now it will always be remembered as Joe Strummer's Redemption, and it could make you cry to think about it.    And while you're at it, listen to \\"All in a Day\\" (it's funnier if you work retail and actually have to wear a vest to work). Or \\"Burning Streets\\", with lyrics that reach back to The Clash (\\"London is burning / Don't tell the queen\\"), or even on \\"Midnight Jam,\\" which Strummer didn't quite finish, you can hear him quote himself in the spoken word background, you can hear echos of \\"London Calling,\\" \\"Radio Clash,\\" and \\"White Riot.\\" There's \\"Ramshakle Day Parade\\" which Strummer wrote about 9/11. And then, the swan song: \\"Silver & Gold,\\" (origionally by Bobby Charles): if you don't cry one time you may not be human.    Every track is worth it. And the band makes a political statement with the album: a call for the return of truth and justice, a call that the masses should take up and cry out in the streets, if we weren't paralyzed with grief. This album is truly great, and only Joe Strummer could have done these songs just right. Listen, remember, grieve, and feel good about punk, and the music again.    Thanks for everything Joe. We miss you. Rest in Piece.
B000003TAW|4.0|This album rocks!  I'm a long time Weezer fan and own all of thier albums.  This album is a must have as it is the one that started it all for Weezer in 1994.  Whether you like punk, emo, top 40 or just plain rock, then Weezer is for you.  This album (as well as all of their others) manages to combine so many different sounds and styles into something totally unique, totally Weezer.  And the end product is an amazing album.  From the hit songs like \\"Buddy Holly\\", \\"The Sweater Song\\" and \\"Say it Ain't So\\" to lesser known track such as \\"Jonas\\", \\"The World has Turned\\" and \\"Garage\\", this album produces song after song of the highest quality music (both lyrically and musically). You can hum along to the catchy tunes and rock out to their hammering guitars.  As a warning, after listening you may experience the \\"can't get the song out of my head\\" syndrome. Weezer will definately go down in history as one of the most innovative and flat out greatest bands so I suggest you get this album as well as Pinkerton, The Green Album and Maladroit.  You won't regret it!
B000001DYY|5.0|Along with \\"Seeds Of Love\\", this is my favorite Tears For Fears cd.  I love all of their stuff, but there is just something about this one that makes it better.  Maybe it's that Roland Orzabal vented his frustrations at departed band member, and long-time friend, Curt Smith.  Maybe it's because there's more of a rock-edge to this cd.  Maybe it's because he wrote these songs with different songwriting partners.  OR, maybe it's a combination of all of the above! <br /> <br />From the very first song, it becomes apparent that this is a very strong set.  The music is tight, the lyrics are good and Roland's voice is strong.  The music relies less on synthesizers than in the past.  There are more guitars here.  Nothing spells out frustration like a bit more guitar, eh?   <br /> <br />The title track, \\"Break It Down Again\\", \\"Dog's A Best Friends Dog\\" and the fantastic \\"Goodnight Song\\" are my favorites on the record.  Roland sheds the 80s synth music and turns his back a bit on the Beatles.  This particular cd doesn't sound much like any of the other Tears For Fears cds.  And, I think that's what makes it so great.  Roland picked up some new songwriting partners and went in a different direction.   <br /> <br />If you're a fan of 90's college music, you should buy this cd.  Don't be afraid because of the name of the band.  It's not the pop music they released in the 80s.
B00006F7S4|5.0|When it came to Beck's hipper-than-hip records in the 90's, I liked them all without ever falling in love with their remote coolness.  So I'm sure many, like me, were shocked by Sea Change, a brave, sad, stark album of loneliness and isolation that's amongst the coldest records released in the past 15 years.  From the opening guitar of \\"The Golden Age,\\" we're given a newer game than we expected - Beck as confessional songwriter of great sensitivity.  The song is a knockout, that deep baritone whistfully admitting in the chorus \\"these days, I barely get by.\\"  It's unusual to hear albums this intimate, but in every song on this clunker-free masterpiece, we're treated to the unbridled truth of loneliness made with flawlessly mournful rock production.  It might not quite be Blood on the Tracks, but it's as close as any artist could hope to get nowadays.
B000060P79|1.0|They have a \\"Simple Plan\\" sure enough.... That plan is to  <br />suck for the entire time they are in music. Too many of <br />today's bands sound just alike. How can you tell the <br />difference between them? There are some exceptions... But <br />this band isn't one of them!
B00000IFP6|5.0|<br />I own this set in addition to the more traditional, classic renditions of the symphonies (Karajan's 8th and 9th, Kleiber's 5th, Walter's 4th and 6th).  I love those classic renditions, but this one too.  It is a different sound and a different interpretation.  It keeps what I think are the strongest aspects of period instruments--the small orchestra, lean textures and fast tempi.  But it does not have the acidic sound of period violins.   <br />     <br />While some may think that this is not Beethoven, I think this may actually be close what Beethoven wrote; the tempi are closer to his metronome markings, and the size of the orchestra is closer to that in Beethoven's day.    <br />     <br />So if you sometimes are tired of listening to the same sound and interpretation, this comes as a fresh sound and approach.  It is rewarding to have in one's library both approaches.  I do not feel like I am duplicating anything; the experience is very diffferent and one enjoys hearing familiar material in a new light.
B0001LJCPC|3.0|It's a shame that so many of the 'reviews' of this cd are actually people asking about particular tracks, etc. There are better places for that, one being [...] where you can actually get all the information about your favourite track whether it appears on the cds or not, and download the tracks that don't. <br /> <br />Now, a bit of information: the Vol.1 and Vol.2 cds combined contain 32 tracks (though some of that is dialogue). There are probably another 40 or so (!) floating around the net, whether they're completely different songs, extended versions, or whatever. Admittedly some of those tracks are better than those on the cds (for example the Lily Chou-Chou song which plays when the Bride admires the sword, or Morricone's \\"For A Fistful Of Dollars\\"). <br /> <br />But it seems that with the cds, what Tarantino and his soundtrack producers have tried to do is just get across the 'vibe' of the movies. Yes, your favourite song may not be there but the essence of the movie basically is. If you really want to get a specific song, make sure you listen to sound clips and know that the song you are looking for is on the cd before buying - most of them are, but you could be disappointed. <br /> <br />So anyway, as others have said, Vol.2 features quite a lot more downtempo stuff, which matches the more subdued nature of the film. Morricone finally gets a well-deserved name check despite one or two of his tunes appearing in the first film.  <br /> <br />All in all, not a bad cd, but nothing too spectacular. 3 stars.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Global warming begins to take a serious turn in Roland Emmerich's roller coaster journey as Mother Nature decides that humans have finally done enough destruction to the Earth.  The temperature begins to raise through global warming which initiates a huge melt down of the ice in the Arctic.  This melt down of ice affects the water temperature in oceans, which leads to changes in the ocean currents.  The ocean currents have a huge impact on the climate throughout the world, which the audience is to witness as Mother Nature kicks humanity's (...)with tornados, hurricanes, typhoons, hail, rain, and temperature shifts.<br /><br />The climatologist, Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), has a theory that will lead to a new ice age in the next 100 years or so.  However, the vice president ignores Jack as the precautions that Jack wants would cost too much money and affect the American life style.  What Jack does not know is that Mother Nature has sped up the process as the world is about to see a new ice age within a month that will affect the northern hemisphere.<br /><br />In the middle of the climate disaster Jack has to face a family crisis as he has neglected his wife as they are separated.  Jack has also neglected his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), as he is constantly traveling around the world in the name of climate science.  This family crisis is what brings the adventure to the film as Sam is stranded in a flooded New York, and Jack realizes that he must do right to his son by keeping his word.  However, the family crisis becomes a banal situation, as the life of Sam seems less worth than Jack's promise.<br /><br />Day After Tomorrow is a visual popcorn popping roller coaster where the close calls are many and frequent.  The close calls display unearthly hero's that outruns rapid super tides, fast crawling temperature drops of deadly consequence, and long distant snow threading super athletes.  The word cliffhanger had once a meaning, but after the films large number of close calls it becomes a clich&eacute;.<br /><br />The Day After Tomorrow begins with a promise of suspense, which it delivers, but to the expense of the story and characters.  The film has superb special effects, e.g., Los Angles being chewed by monstrous tornados and New York being swallowed by the Atlantic Ocean.  However, the story takes a back seat to the special effects and all the close calls, which significantly hurts the films potential.  Nonetheless, Day After Tomorrow offers an decent cinematic adventure that will keep the audience's attentions with excitement and weather bombardment..

B00028HBKC|5.0|From a truly Christian standpoint, the history of biblical movies has generally not been impressive. Even the best of them, movies like The Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur, have not completely been able to shake off a Hollywood feel that suppresses the true spirituality. We're so accustomed to the usual garbage that Hollywood feeds us that when something truly different and better comes along the effect is almost shocking. <br />Movies about the life of Christ in particular have been rather dissapointing. There have been a few credible efforts, but most of them, like The Last Temptation of Christ, have portrayed Jesus as a weak and ineffectual character, completely suppressing the divine in his nature. And anyone watching their portrayal of the Passion would think that crucifixion is no big deal, the way they portray it as so (relatively) painless and dignified. <br />That was the true genius of this movie, to unflinchingly portray the very real suffering of Christ when He died for our sins. Once you have seen this movie there is no hiding from or rationalizing the fact of His agony on the cross. That is why Gibson chose to focus on that one supreme event from the Gospels. <br />It really makes me choke when I hear people deride this film for its violence. A movie like Kill Bill can have people sliced to pieces left and right, and the critics will fall all over themselves rushing to praise it. The Passion depicts violence in a historically accurate manner, for a very serious purpose, and people who defend all manner of disgusting things in film criticize it. People continue to call this film anti-semitic long after all the dire warnings of pogroms in the streets of America have failed to come true. Oh well. The ones who didn't like this movie were mostly the ones who didn't like the book either. <br />Mel Gibson never intended this film to be the blockbuster that it became. It was intended to be an art house flick, that would play in a limited run and probably be very popular on DVD. It was the controversy, ironically enough, that propelled it to such blockbuster status. The hype at times was overdone. As much as I loved this movie, I didn't find it to be a life-changing experience. This movie did have flaws, as every movie does. But it is still a superb and deeply moving religious movie that deserves to still be watched and remembered for generations to come. As I'm sure it will be. The greatest criticism I have of this movie? As many others have said, the book was still better. :)
B0002S94OS|1.0|After their first album I thought they were off to a great start, but after that album they have went straight down.  This album is a horrible waste of money.  LOG sucks!  Listen to Arsis if you want to hear some real metal.
B0000013G9|5.0|I love TLC's 2nd album CRAZYSEXYCOOL a lot... this album was one of my first purchases ever...but this album is not my favourite by them...FANMAIL is my favourite album EVER!!!! that was the comeback album that showed every1 that they still had it... <br /> <br />Anyways this album has the greatest cover of all time 'if i was your girlfriend' (originally by the living legend PRINCE)...Every song on this LP was done perfectly from 'diggin' on you' to 'kick your game' to 'case of the fake people'...  <br /> <br />The inspirational song of our lifetime has to be 'waterfalls' (their greatest hit)... not to ride on anyone's jock but Left Eye's flow in this song was possibly the best one i have ever heard....It was timeless, had compassion, depth, and true meaning (not like all these fake rappers nowadays that dont say anything new or has depth)... <br /> <br />CRAZYSEXYCOOL has changed the game in R&B, POP, and HIP-HOP music... no wonder it sold 15 million+ albums.... <br /> <br />TLC is and will always be my favourite female group regardless of Left Eyes departure...
B00006BTCA|3.0|So the remaining, i.e. living members of Joy Division/New Order, Echo and the Bunnymen and the Psychedelic Furs should be quite happy with their young disciples Interpol.  Interpol are not great, but not bad either. They are revivalists of a sort rather than originators.  Which is not necessarily a bad thing because they add something of themselves while resurecting a good sound.  I saw them at the 9:30 Club in D.C. last year and they were entertaining.  Interpol are derivitive its true, but I like TOTBL nonetheless though since I was a huge fan of Joy Division and that early '80s sound and Interpol do it well.  It's cool that someone is following in JD's dark footsteps.
B00031TXBI|4.0|For you's who have heard the other albums in the series this one isnt alot different. The guitars are more distorted, with plenty 'o' riffs and solos. The opening song is brilliant (something ive noticed about all the these albums) \\"give me your hands, give me your hands\\" i could listen to that line for the rest of my days! other notable tracks are \\"look on\\" and \\"emptiness\\" Some of the songs are mediocore and slightly boring but this cd is still worth buying. <br /> <br />I think this cd is my favourite so far apart from ataxia.
6305696071|2.0|Totally ridiculous story line.  Unbelievible at best.  Though I liked her new clothes.  Quite fashionable.  Probably my dislike of Richard Gere has something to do with my negative reaction.  It got better rewatching it on a cold, rainy afternoon.  But not much, only bearable.  This one seems to be a man's movie.  All the men I know liked it.  Some even cried at the end.  Go figure!

0312263120|1.0|Forgive me if I'm wrong, but didn't I just read this plot in Deception Point?  Granted, I am not aware of the chronology of his works, but this book merely follows Brown's safe setup, the double crossing boss, the incredibly intelligent and yet laughably gullible woman, the European connection, incompetent assassins and the absolutely shameful dialogue in the 'love' scenes.     The references to our thirty-eight year old female Head of Cryptography never having sex with an animal \\"and until last night, it was true.\\" and the part where she  says \\"Any more interesting than last night and I'll never walk again\\" just made me shudder. The author even repeats himself; twice we read that any third grader with a modem can gain access to the NSA's main databank. The tedium stretches over many paragraphs at the end while these supposed sharpest brains in the country act like a bunch of five year olds trying to find the code whilst I am screaming the answer (or perhaps I am super intelligent and should sign up for the NSA without delay?) and please, if you still insist on reading this novel, PLEASE don't read the final chapter. You'll just die of embarrassment.    Dan Brown is starting to stretch his capabilities. I suggest he take a long vacation, (with his wife, and actually LISTEN to how she talks romantically), live off his mega Da Vinci Code earnings and come back in five years with an original idea.

All I could think about with Jesus covered in blood, wounds gaping, was \\"I hope to GOD there's no lemon juice nearby.\\"
038551123X|5.0|Dexter Morgan is a thirty-year-old blood-spatter specialist working for the Miami-Dade police crime lab. He's an expert at his job, liked -- or at least accepted -- by most of his coworkers, and a person of interest to several women, including incompetent homicide detective LaGuerta. He's also a fully self-aware and quite inhuman monster, the product of some undescribed familial trauma in his early youth, who has spent his life learning to fake the emotions he doesn't possess naturally. He was coached in this by his foster father, Harry, a highly-regarded cop who recognized what young Dexter really was and taught him to turn it to positive uses. Now, when the Dark Passenger who resides in his mind decides, periodically, that it's time to come out and play, Dexter always has someone lined up who deserves to die slowly. Perhaps a child-killer, or a pathological hospice nurse who's too free with the morphine, or simply a warped priest. Because Dexter does his best not to harm the \\"innocent.\\" He also tries to help his foster sister, Deb, a lusciously-built vice cop who doesn't really know how to be a girl, feels comfortable only in a blue uniform, and wants more than anything to graduate to Homicide. She also seems to have unspoken suspicions about her brother's ability to predict how killers will think and act. Now there's a serial killer on the loose -- another one besides Dexter, that is -- and Dexter is fascinated by his artistic technique and longs to meet him, even though he's also worried. Especially since he seems to know too many details about his rival. What if the Dark Passenger is more in control than he thought? What if Dexter himself is the other killer? This appears to be Lindsay's first novel and it's an extremely original, beautifully thought-out thriller. Dexter is not Hannibal Lector and the reader will quickly become sympathetic and anxious for him to survive -- before being brought up short by a reminder of just what his hobby interests consist of. Dexter's self-deprecating interior monologues, his ruminations on his own nature, his memories of Harry's careful training, all are delightful, thought that hardly seems the word that ought to apply. And, finally, that last chapter is a pip. There's a sequel in the works and I can't wait.Dexter's self-deprecating interior monologues, his ruminations on his own nature, his memories of Harry's careful training, all are delightful, thought that hardly seems the word that ought to apply.

B00003CXCT|5.0|STAR WARS!  You have to love these movies (the first 3, at least, not George Lucas's current rapings of the old ones.).  Jesus, where to begin, these movies are so great...Oh, I know, George Lucas of the 70's planning the rape of his perfect creations years later...What about the part where George Lucas uses his plaid flannel to drain any future creativity out of his body?...Or when George Lucas was stuffing his face with sandwich and saying, in between meaty bites, that Star Wars should start up again!  This time, 3 prequels! <br />I'm lying...those aren't actual parts in the movies...Hmm...let's see... <br />The Ewoks always kinda bugged me, yet I don't know why; Darth Vader was the coolest, cause he could choke guys with his hands from far away; Mark Whoosits played Luke and quickly dropped into obscurity; Han Solo was played by...I don't know...that one guy from Hollywood Homicide...kinda famous?   <br />This kinda stopped being a review and turned into rambling...I don't know where to go. <br /> <br />These movies are great, as most people and smelly, unshaved guys know.

B000035Z3K|5.0|I am a big fan of vampire mythology. I have always been a vampire fanatic for as long as I can remember (since high school). I have seen my fair share of vampire flicks, most have been good (for example \\"Nosferatu\\") and some have been horrendous (like \\"Queen of the Damned\\"). One of my all time favorite vampire films is the classic 1939 black and white film \\"Dracula\\" starring Bela Lugosi. What really makes this movie a classic to me is that despite the minimal effects and budget this movie had, it still captures a dark, sinister atmosphere. Bela Lugosi for me is Dracula. Forget Frank Langella or Gary Oldman. Bela's portrayal of \\"Dracula\\" is timeless. Based on the Bram Stoker nove, \\"Dracula\\" follows the book faithfully which is hardly what the Gary Oldman film is about. This \\"Dracula\\" does not show Dracula as this romantic monster that Gary Oldman portrayed him to be or like Brad Pitt's Louis in \\"Interview With the Vampire\\". Bela Lugosi's Dracula was seductive but more evil and sinister. Tragically Bela Lugosi's too convincing performance in this film forever typecasted him which he was never able to break free of. I still love watching this movie especially during this time of year of tricks or treats.
0385504217|3.0|I had to read this to see what all of the fuss was about. The storyline itself is a page turner. I looked forward to reading it each night and had trouble putting it down. I was dissappointed in the ending and found the last 100 pages rather predictable. Overall- a good read. As for all the fuss....just a bunch of ill-educated folks thinking this was based on something real. If your looking for God, try the Bible!
068987474X|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book after I saw that it was the basis of a Sex and the City plot that I'd really enjoyed.  But I didn't really enjoy the book as much as I hoped I would.  While I thought the book read easily, I just ended up skimming the letters and his (sometimes vulgar) responses to them.    I think my biggest problem were that the letters didn't come across as real.  It almost felt like they were crafted just so the author could make particular points about it.  Some of these letters seemed ridiculous, almost to the point where it had \\"BAD RELATIONSHIP!!\\" and big flashing arrows pointing to it and you wondered how so many women get caught into relationships with married men that don't leave their wives, that emotionally abuse them and that take them for granted.    For example, there's one series of letters from a girl named 'Nikki' that calls the author dumb and brags about her music video producer boyfriend, how he's soooo nice to her ... when he's been drinking, how he hardly ever has time for her ... but she's okay with that because he's sooo hot and important.  I honestly couldn't see anyone really writing the kind of things she wrote without stepping back and go \\"Wait a minute.\\"    It just feels like the author makes everything too black and white.  I don't like how women talk about how it's empowering or liberating, because I don't see it as that way.  Rather, I see it as being uncompromising and mean-spirited.  I think relationships are about compromise from both parties and a relationship without any compromise, be it on the woman's side or man's side, is not a good one.  I think the author encourages a \\"He called all the shots before, but now it's my turn\\" attitude.    Overall, it was an okay read but I would take it with lots of grains of salt.
0375507256|4.0|Near the end of the novel, one of the novel's character poses the question whether the way the epic story unfolds is gimicky. For me, I still can't decide but the entire journey that spanned 1000 years and all across the world will stay with me for a very long time.<br /><br />The novel is comprise of 6 relatively short stories loosely connected with each other. If each story is taken individually, many readers will find that each story is familiar and has been better written about in other novels. However there is one central theme that governs throughout all 6 stories spanning 1000 years, and it is that all through history, the rich and the strong have always been able to subjugate the poor and the meek. The entire novel serves as a warning what will happen to our world if the strong and the powerful went about their ways unchecked by a separate authority. It is not until the last story, in post-apocaplytic Hawaii in the very far future, that the author offered us a glimpse of how mankind do survive and will have a chance to remake civilization again.<br /><br />Whether this entire novel is gimicky or not, I'll leave the readers to decide, but I do think the theme of this novel is powerful enough that many readers should overlook this question.
B00009P1O0|5.0|\\"On the Beach\\" is the best album by Neil Young period.  It's sad and somber not to mention moody and depressing.  In other words, it's perfect.  You need to listen to this while smoking a backwoods cigar and just soak it in.  Buy this along with Tonight's the Night and Zuma.  The guitar is perfect and Neil sings his best lyrics.

What he was trying to say was this: \\"I'm pretty much a hack director, and I couldn't come up with anything 'new' on my own.  So I figured the Crow was done so long ago that no one would remember.\\"  Hack.  Affleck?  That cheesy fight scene in the playground?

0767836324|5.0|I used to watch this movie every day when I was younger on VHS, and I got the DVD last month and have watched it 3 times since getting it. (Buena Girl has it now, but I don't know if she's watched it...I hope she likes it as much as I do). I always liked the story of Peter Pan, but I especially liked this version. It is a real moving film, with it's emotional parts that are very important for both kids and adults to relate with, such as family issues, and having the courage to stand up for yourself to overcome overwhelming odds. It also, true to all Peter Pan stories, allows you to realize that theres a kid inside of all of us, and what this movie does that others don't do, is allow us to see that even though the kid in us is hard to find once we get older, it is still there and if we look hard enough we will find it. A great movie!!!
B00063MBU8|4.0|I honestly wasn't expecting to be happy with this cd. I'd expected them to follow in Good Charlotte's footsteps, getting increasingly poppy with each new cd, but thankfully they're not. I dare say this cd is harder than the first one. I don't know what the first reviewer is smoking, but they never talk about high school. Girlfriends, sure, but yeah, they're in their 20s, it's not unreasonable to write about relationships. And that's not all they write about either. Good cd. I recommend it.
B00005U2JL|5.0|First off, this is an excellent DVD. The music sounds great but only comes alive when played on a surround sound system or in your portable DVD player with earphones hooked up and the volume on maximum. Plus, the footage is very artistic in my opinion and I enjoyed seeing all the various concert footage from all over the world. I can't speak for everyone else but I can tell you what I think and leave it to you to decide whether you wanna buy it or not. It's worth a look, but make sure your DVD player is hooked up to a good surround sound stereo system. <br />The whole effect will make you feel like you're actually there at the concert if you turn up the volume and start head banging. <br /> <br />Marilyn Manson is my all-time favorite band, period. This DVD also contains an extra feature called \\"The Death Parade\\", which features 30 minutes of explicit & outrageous material, including: backstage footage of Manson following an incident in which he seriously tore a bloody hole on his knee, plus you get to see graphic footage of the deep wound being stitched up; Manson setting a hallway on fire; Clips of Manson & Eminem performing \\"The Way I Am\\"; Manson giving speeches, including one about a young girl who committed suicide & Marilyn Manson dedicates a song for her. There's also a hilarious clip of Manson calling a fan on stage after being hit with a water bottle by the stupid fan. Manson challanges the fan in a water bottle throwing showdown.   <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|b4 the movie came out, my 10 yr old cousin keeps telling me we should watch dis movie as soon as it hits d theater...i told her i need to see d preview first (just to make sure it's not one of those teeny movie, kids cant watch) nweis, for d whole day, we watched d tube and waited and waited until it's previewed...DANG!!! my comment, \\"we've got to see d movie\\"...as soon as it started, all we did was laugh...dats ryt! it's nonsense...but if ur shallow (or maybe not so shallow LOL) n just want a gud laugh, i recommend PEOPLE HU'S ALWAYS ONLYN CHATTING, get your aSS up and watch it...gaaa! ur an idiot if u miss dis...well dats ol, my lips r burning, gotta put some chapstick hehehe...pEaCEoUt!
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara Fabian transcends the pop genre, much too much by far.  Her melodious connection from note to note is right on the dot and her interpretations always match the music that she is handed, and though agreeably, there are some songs in the album that have been branded as bland, it is not through any fault of her own that they don't \\"latch\\" on as quick. To the reviewer who said that she should speak better English, give me a break.  She also doesn't \\"just about duets with anyone\\" (i.e., Josh Groban is not \\"just anyone\\").  This top-notch lady can sing anything (in any genre in my opinion) and doesn't need any vocal acrobatics to coat her appeal and vocal reach.  I'm definitely a fan now.
B0006213WG|5.0|As a big Sum 41 fan, I am trying not to be biased here! I bought this CD as soon as it was released and I wasn't dissapointed! They have changed a lot since half hour of power, but in my opinion they've changed for the better. Addmitedly, some songs sound simarlar to others, but not all the time, and it isn't that noticable. I would recommend this CD!
B00020HEL6|5.0|This girl can sing!!  She will knock your socks off!  Take it from a Metallica and old Van Halen fan -- this girl is really something special!  Music you didn't think you'd like is represented so wonderfully, you can't help but tap your toe and marvel at the beautiful voice that comes from this young woman.  Be prepared to dance in your living rooms!  Her commanding voice far exceeds her years, and she rekindles the fabulous spirit of blues and jazz that can only be felt from the heart. We have found our \\"era\\" parents' Christmas gifts.  Don't pass this up!
B0001V6ZJ8|1.0|The idiots have struck again!  Ruined a beautiful film by cutting it up to fit a tv screen..are they all insane?!!! If I hadn't opened it, I would return it to amazon now! A flim that was shot in a wide screen format should be shown on the small screen that way. The directors vision has been ruined again by money grubbing fools!  Don't buy it.
B0000025DR|4.0|And now I'm 20 and I still am transported back to the day when I discovered that the theme song to my FAVORITE ride at Funtown (the Astrodome) was an ELO song entitled \\"Fire on High\\"  I listen to it all the time and just let myself slip back into a simpler time when you could ride the \\"scrambler\\" and watch a SPECTACULAR laser light show...
B00004ZAV3|3.0|This isn't a vital addition to The Beatles canon, just another compilation. This is really only for the ultra neophite, casual fan or completist. Even for the beginer I would reccomend starting with \\"Please Please Me\\" and going on from there. As far as compilations go the red and blue sets are more comprehensive. Collectors will already have this material (in better forms, I might add). The biggest issue I have with this set is the sound quality. It is so doused in noise reduction it nearly drowns, totally sucking the life out of the performances (the tapes were never that noisy to warrant this proceedure). In short it is dreadful. Go with the full albums. Even better, go with the original 60's UK vinyl.
068987474X|1.0|First of all, if you bought \\"the rules\\" then you don't need this book.  Secondly, I don't need a MARRIED man telling me, a happy singleton how to act and what to do in regards to dating and relationships. If you do all that stuff the book suggests you to do you are not being true to yourself you are acting as a clone to the people who wrote this book.  I say be yourself and be proud of who you are and if relationships don't work out then that wasn't the person that you were meant to be with.  Get out of the house and go have fun.  Don't waste your time reading this trash. <br /> <br />I swear Oprah is not god... come on people she heavily endorses Dr. Phil who is a FAT guy who wrote a book on how to loose weight...now if that's not an oxymoron I don't know what is.   <br /> <br />Take the $15 dollars you would have spent on this trash and go buy yourself a drink, you deserve one. <br />
0743455967|5.0|When I picked up this book, I expected to like it since I am a rabid King fan. I was refreshed by the information he included about himself. I too, am trying to write a book of my own and while it is not in the style or Mr. King, we are in the same basket, so to speak. He made me feel that writing is not an impossible goal and that I just have to remember the story wants to be told. His advice was simple and clear, with a few rules peppered along the way. Much more interesting then dry, boring text books, I would recomend this book to anyone who was trying to break out in this form of business. Thank you again Mr. King, your simplicity is your greatest gift.
078324228X|4.0|Although possessing many factual discrepencies (something for which others have condemned it but I do not; the movie does not purport to be a documentary) and at 2 hours and 25 minutes is a tad long, I was fairly satisfied overall with the film.<br /><br />The movie, through a complex but unconfusing group of flashbacks and temporal distortions quickly establishes Rubin Carter's tragic condition: wrongfully arrested, persecuted all his life, railroaded by the justice system and incarcerated in a penitentiary for the remainder of his life.  Juxtaposed with Rubin's story is the story of Lesra, a black child taken to Canada by white do-gooders who becomes encaptured with the story of Rubin Carter and bonds with him.  Lesra begins to communicate with and eventually meet Rubin, and along with his foster family dedicates himself to getting Rubin Carter out of prison.  The white Canadians are initially mistrusted by Rubin, but he soon begins to like and respect them and they eventually compose enough evidence to propose a new trial that ultimately frees him.<br /><br />As can be expected, Rubin Carter's image is polished up for the film (in reality he was booted out of the army after 4 court-martials) and no question is made of his innocence.  As mentioned, the film does not pretend to be a documentary, but some aspects of it annoyed me (did a young Rubin Carter really fend off a pedophile from harassing his friend and ultimately stab the pedophile in order to save his own life?), especially the inclusion of the racist cop, Della Pesca, who pesecutes Rubin from the start of the film to the end (he was a fictitious character, so why include such an annoying plot device?), but this was on the whole a solid film.  6.5/10
B0002PZVHK|5.0|I went to sleep to this album and track 4 (\\"Shadow\\") gave me the creepiest, most unpleasant dream EVER.  I was on an abandoned cruise ship late at night, and my dead mother (who's not really dead) was singing and rocking baby me in her arms.  Awesome record, but...I mean...just a little heads-up.  Listen to it awake.
B000056NX5|4.0|I have listened to all the sound tracks and watched the 1973 movie and this one as well. I did not get to watch the original broadway hit from 1971 since I was not born yet, but I consider that version to have the best soundtrack, as I believe Judas, Jesus, and the Priests had a much stronger and more compelling performance than the other versions. I think that the new JCS is great, and would advise anyone who owns the movie version from 1973 to see this one as well as it gives a much more modern look which adds a whole new dimension to the classic. I wish, however, that there was an existing copy of the original broadway play from 1971, as the music of that version just excels the newer versions.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I rented and viewed \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" recently. <br /> <br />I was bored throughout and would have simply turned it off and hit \\"rewind\\", had I not paid to see the movie.  <br /> <br />I had read nothing but negative reviews of \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" and had rented it with the intention of setting straight those who were so critical of a movie depicting the nightmare worst case scenario of global warming--something I consider to be a real possibility. <br /> <br />Sadly, I must now join the chorus of critics of Roland Emmerich's latest cliche-ridden disaster flick. <br /> <br />The film is characterized by a suffocating concoction of dauntless American heroism and sappy traditional home and family values rubbed into the viewer's nose ad nauseum--a reflection, no doubt, of the mood now prevalent in this nation. <br /> <br />There is also excessive Hollywood style special effect sock, bang and pow noise and violence where a thoughtful examination of the very real issue of global warming might have been more helpful. <br /> <br />Additionally, as per Hollywood's stock in trade formula, inordinately intelligent African Americans spout endless profundities, while no Native American, Hispanic or Arab American says or does anything noteworthy. <br /> <br />There is even a quasi-supernatural demonization of escaped zoo wolves at one point to further annoy the thoughtful viewer. <br /> <br />And a child-like PG 13 rendition of a sanitized hand-holding romance between two brainy students is as near as the movie comes to anything romantic. <br />  <br />Global warming is a serious and pressing problem for the human species--one made more so by the Bush administration's refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol. <br /> <br />But Emmerich's \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\"--a movie that could have been a great teaching tool--so trivializes the issue that the cause of enlightenment about the perils of global warming may have been done more harm than good. <br /> <br />I was very disappointed by \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". <br /> <br />D.

B00005AAFS|5.0|WOW. I never heard anything like this before. This is my first Rammstein cd I got and I am very impressed. This band is great. I was introduced to them when one of my friends showed me the video for Mutter and I couldn't stop watching it. Then they showed me the awesome videos for Ich Will and Sonne. Those songs/videos were made well and sung and played well also. I like how they speak German in all there songs and they still made it big in America. Usually if a band comes here they would translate it into English but anyway the singer can sing great. Guitar sounds great in every song. I love the drumming especially in Mutter which is kind of a sad song once you see the video for it. I love hearing the keyboard in almost every song its used on. I think there are even some keyboard solos.    RATINGS:  1.Mein Herz Brent-(4:39)-10/10  2.Links 234-(3:36)-10/10  3.Sonne-(4:32)-10/10  4.Ich Will-(3:37)-10/10  5.Feuer Frei!-(3:08)-10/10  6.Mutter-(4:28)-10/10  7.Spielhur-(4:46)-10/10  8.Zwitter-(4:17)-10/10  9.Rein Raus-(3:09)-10/10  10.Adios-(3:48)-9/10  11.Nebel-(4:54)-9/10    OVERALL-GREAT CD, GREAT PRICE, BUY IT.
B000683VI4|5.0|I read both the book and watched the movie in the theatre. I was very impressed that even after reading the book I still did not know all that would happen. I cryed at the end of the movie as well as the last chapter of the book. I am a sucker for romance and I have to tell you that there was not a dry eye in the house. I have read other Nick Sparks books and seen the movies but none have touched me more than the Notebook. It gives you hope that even in the worst of situations that love endeed does concore all.
B0000D96NW|3.0|This cd was good. Great lyrics, guitar, and drums. The vocals are probably the main thing that makes this cd good. Guitar is heavy, and cool because of the solos in some songs. Drumming is just about like all the other drumming in any metal band but it still makes the cd better. Only a couple of songs got boring after one listen because they were long or I just didn't hear stuff as good as what I heard from the best tracks on the cd. It starts off with an awesome 6 minutes song, and it is probably my favorite song on the cd. <br /> <br />RATINGS: <br />1.Imperium- (6:41)-10/10 <br />2.Bite the Bullet- (3:21)-7/10 <br />3.Left Unfinished- (5:32)-10/10 <br />4.Elegy- (3:55)-7/10 <br />5.In the Presence of my Enemies- (7:05)-9/10 <br />6.Days turn Blue to Gray- (5:22)-8/10 <br />7.Vim- (5:11)- 9/10 <br />8.Seasons Wither- (6:14)-7/10 <br />9.All Falls Down- (4:28)-10/10 <br />10.Wipe the Tears- (3:50)-7/10 <br />11.Descend the Shades of Night- (7:44)-9/10 <br /> <br />Overall-a good cd to own if you were a fan of them before, but if your new I would recommend picking up some of there older stuff. <br />
B000002BYD|4.0|Pearl Jam emerged from the Seattle 'grunge' scene as one of it's premiere exports with their unique vocal stylings, very well-written lyrics, and propulsive musicianship.   <br /> <br />\\"Ten\\" is one of my personal all-time favorite CDs ever.  It's really nearly perfect in every respect.  This is PJ firing on all cylinders, plus the exuberance, passion, and energy of their youth.  Simply amazing. <br /> <br />This was followed by a fantastic second album, 'Vs.'  It was essentially more of the good stuff from \\"Ten,\\" but a little more introspective and personal on Eddie Vedder's lyrics.  This album also was more rhythmically dynamic. <br /> <br />For the sake of the review, we'll just fast forward a few years to the release of \\"Yield\\", the CD in question!  For me, this CD brought back the PJ that I loved on the first two CDs.   <br /> <br />One of the best Pearl Jam songs ever is on this album...a song called \\"Given To Fly.\\"  Starting off with a dreamy phased guitar strumming out a Zeppelin ala Going to California type phrase with Eddie nearly whispering the lyrics, this song builds wave upon wave to the soaring epic wail and power of a PJ masterpiece.  It still gives me goosebumps every time. <br /> <br />The whole CD is very consistently good, though not quite as solid as \\"Ten.\\"  \\"Ten\\" is an incredibly hard act to follow, and several of PJ's cds have meandered from the path they set down to explore other musical ideas.   <br /> <br />\\"Yield\\" is excellent in it's focus and power from the old days while still moving forward with it's ideas.  I recommend \\"Yield\\" VERY highly.
B0001MDPV8|2.0|Nas has always followed the magazines' opinion that his Illmatic was his only good album and that everything that he does must be compared to it.  That is why he released \\"Stillmatic\\" as an answer.  This is also why he has re-released \\"Illmatic.\\"    Ten year anniversary?  For an Album?  Only after ten years?  What other hip-hop album has had a ten year anniversary re-release?  Either this guy thinks he really is as great as he thinks he is or he is just trying to hold onto a career off of one decent single per album.  Come to think about it, most rappers today are only lasting because of one hit single per album as opposed to many good albums.    Nas stole his style from Kool G Rap and continues to beat us in the head with nothing but hype and the same style year after year, album after album.  This guy even had the nerve to say that he was in the game for ten years before it really was tens years!  Nas and Jay-Z.  Fake battles, hype and soft music.  Retire Nas.    There was once a time in the rap game where corny has-been rappers would not be heard from again, but in this day and age where hype can get you a hit and one single can get you a platinum LP, careers have been undeservingly prolonged.  Jay-Z is in the same boat.  They both had the nerve to call themselves the king.  If they really knew it, they would not have to say it, we would all know it.  There is only one king.  He has been on top for 20 years.  Going platinum when selling 300,000 was like going gold.  That king is, like Micheal Jordan, having to wait for Magic and Bird to disappear before he could once and for all show the world that his title has no equal.  That king, the ONLY is - L.L. Cool J!
B0002OXVDW|5.0|The biggest extra of all - all three \\"That's Entertainment\\" films are presented in two versions. <br /> <br />Side A of each disc has the widescreen version, as shown in theaters, for the rich people with 16:9 widescreen television sets. <br /> <br />Side B is in the \\"Standard Version\\", \\"presented in a format preserving the multiple aspect rations of its original theatrical exhibition\\", for us poor people with old fashioned 4:3 television sets. <br /> <br />Which means that, on an 4:3 TV, non-widescreen clips, presented on side A either in reduced size, with black bars at the top, bottom, AND both sides, or widescreen with the top and bottom of the picture cut off, can be viewed on side B full screen (no black bars) and yet widescreen films on side B are in the correct widescreen aspect ration (with black bars at top and bottom). <br /> <br />So us poor people should now watch the B sides, and, when we all get rich and get our widescreen television sets, we can switch to the A sides at no additional expense.
B00005YXZH|5.0|As an Uncle Tupelo/Wilco fan, I bought this album immediately when it came out.  My personal taste for Wilco is centered around Being There more than the others, so upon first listen, I was a bit put off by it.  It sounded like Tweedy was trying to be weird for the sake of being weird, so with my lack of patience, I tossed it aside.   <br />A couple of years in the bottom of my collection, and I dusted it off and gave it another go.  This album is amazing.  The underlying basis of most of the songs is still alt country, three chord music, but the songs are pieced together with snippets and pieces of sounds in a way that both respects the musical experiences of their creators and makes something new and interesting.   <br />This album is a timely reflection of both technology and tradition, rolled into a concise, startling, and personal album.
B0000057C5|3.0|Yeah the music sounds cool, the beat is crazy, and the melody and SFX are incredible.  But all you have to do is take a look at the lyrics, translate, and you'll see that this is nothing but sick and twisted metal.
B0002S94BG|5.0|As I already owned Grace on CD, I bought this nicely packaged Legacy Edition 3-disc set (a bonus DVD disc is included) for the second disc. This contains some choice previously unreleased material along with 5 contemporary bonus tracks from EPs, soundtracks and the like, which alone justified the price of admission.<br /><br />It kicks off to a great start with Forget Her, which was bumped off Grace in favour of the newly-recorded So Real, and would have made a great single. It is surprising, despite the personal reasons, that it has taken a decade for this to surface legitimately, as it surpasses even the posthumous single Everybody Here Wants You.<br /><br />Dream Brother here appears both in an early version with different lyrics and a remix, named after Jeff Buckley's favorite incense,  which he prepared for the promo Grace tour CD. The next handful of tracks, all cover versions, recorded at Bearsville during the Grace sessions but on a smaller informal performance stage, were spontaneously captured on 2-track DAT as Jeff played tribute to some of his musical icons - Hank Williams, Screaming Jay Hawkins, Bob Dylan, Bukka White and Nina Simone.<br /><br />So Real was recorded when Michael Tighe joined the band on additional guitar, and a studio version of Big Star's Kanga-Roo, a popular extended live encore, was completed at the same time in a glorious 14-minute all-singing all-dancing version.<br /><br />The film First Love, First Rites featured Jeff Buckley performing deep soul-style, with Shudder To Think, on the soundtrack, replete with Stax-style horns. The song, I Want Someone Badly was written by Nathan Larson from the band, and shows Jeff in an unfamiliar musical setting to fine effect.<br /><br />The Road Version of Eternal Life had previously appeared on a CD single of Everybody Here Wants You, re-arranged from the album version to take advantage of Michael Tighe's guitar, and a good chance to hear the band rock out as they did onstage. This is also shown on the live version of Kick Out The Jams that follows, the only one I have found so far on CD, although often performed, notably at Glastonbury in 1995. This one was recorded for his record label's radio show in New York in 1994.<br /><br />Finally, Strawberry Street, not mentioned in the outer-sleeve track listing, but documented in the booklet: this is one of Jeff's earliest original compositions, revisited in some experimental jams he made with Andrew Goodsight and John McNally at the Knitting Factory in May 1993 in the run-up to the Grace sessions.<br /><br />All of these tracks deserve to be heard, and I need hardly say are essential to any Jeff Buckley fan.<br /><br />I had no complaints with my existing CD of Grace, and in fact was slightly trepidatious of the re-mastered version in case it sounded too different. However, it blasts with renewed sheen and vigour through the speakers in its magnificently de-compressed form. Anyone want to buy an old copy of Grace?is is also shown on the live version of Kick Out The Jams that follows, the only one I have found so far on CD, although often performed, notably at Glastonbury in 1995.

B00003CXCT|5.0|When I got my new TV, I was disappointed that I didn't really have room to hook up a VHS player with the Xbox, PS2, N64, and Computer all hooked up to it.  I was bummed that I couldn't watch Star Wars in my own room!  And then, here came the answer...the trilogy on DVD.  I was kind of turned off a bit by it not being the original, but the special edition.  But I let that slide, because, hey, it's Star Wars.  BUT..then you get to the Return of the Jedi and who do you see?  That's right, Mr.Terrible Acting and Terrible Ability to Fake Being Angry Hayden.  Ugh...[jaw drops]...<br /><br />All in all, though, it's good to see the trilogy in such crisp video and sound.  Star Wars has to be, without a doubt, any doubt at all, not even a trillionth of a billionth of a quadripletrillionbillionth of a doubt that they are the best movies ever created.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz... <br /> <br />the new slipknot cd? can't stay awake long enough to listen to it all the way through... its just sooooo slow. even most of the heavier songs seem to be missing the angst that made slipknot stand out. sure they don't do acoustic TERRIBLY, but i don't buy slipknot cd's for acoustic songs. that's what folk music is for. i was not impressed with this disc, hopefully they'll bring back the death on the next cd...
B0001BKAEY|4.0|This movie has the same basic directing and acting skills as the rest of the movies, and all the INSANE coriography with those fight scenes.  But the first one was still the best one over-all. You just can't beat the lobby shootout...although the sick fight in that park with Neo and all the cloned Smiths was HILARIOUS when he pulls out the bo (well, it was a streetpost, but eh, it still works) and messes them all up.  The main thing is that this finally provides the answers to the entire trilogy, even though you'll have to watch all three of them in sequential order three times in order to catch it all.  Definatly a buy for Matrix fans.
B00008RH3L|2.0|I was annoyed by the lack consistency in the main character's accent. It was terrible. Why have someone who cannot keep a consistent accent, have an accent in your movie?
B00005JMJG|4.0|Kaufman (\\"Being John Malkovich,\\" \\"Adaptation\\" among others) again writes a spectacular screenplay which follows the lives of an introverted man searching for love and manic woman who searches for stability, well maybe not stability, but someone who can put up with her, who both goes through unique life events and tries to overcome them to end where they begin.  The movie is loaded with talent, too much to mention, but it is especially Kate Winslet (Titanic) that moves this film along and outshines all others.  She was perfectly cast and she nailed her performance.  She is one of those actresses that seem to work only when she wants, I wish she was working more because she is so talented, however, we'll be seeing plenty of her in 2006.  Even though \\"Titanic\\" made her a household name, it was far from her best work.  The director (Gondry) came from the same mold as Spike Jonze and others (music videos directors) and for some reason, these type of directors are able to make very unique screenplays work.  Jim Carrey did not play his normal character, but a quirky, introverted individual and actually pulled it off.  He showed range that I did not think he had in him and I would be happy to see him in similar type roles.  The supporting cast that consisted of \\"A or almost A\\" list actors (Dunst, Ruffalo, Wood and Wilkinson) were superb in supporting the leads and the story.  The story worked, it was dramatic, visceral and very creative.  Though it is a film that is very unique, some would find it too artsy, I found it compelling and fulfilling and one of my favorite films.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Basically, it's a B-movie with a huge budget.  If you like sensational violence with severed limbs and hot girls killing each other; then you'll probably enjoy the flick.  I was bored by this movie and struggled to make it to the end.    I've never before seen a movie where I kept thinking to myself \\"What a waste of money?\\" so much.  Tarantino could have made the same movie with 1/4 the budget and unknown actors.  Then maybe he would have further developed the plot.
0765301598|3.0|While I am not upset that I read the book (after reading all the previous dune books, I couldn't skip it), it was not as goos as the othjer Legends of Dune books. The handling of the future feud between the two houses was pretty poor and was one of the themes that was most important to the future stories. Anyway, if you are a Dune fan, you might as well read it, but buying a paperback is advised.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Oh my goodness.  When i first was watching the movie i said to myself what the heck am i watching here.  I later realized it was a warped but beautiful love story.  James Spader is hot as usual.  The man just makes me melt.  I have to say the best part of the movie was the last twenty minutes.  I do not want to say anything but what i am going to say is that Spader made me melt.  If you are a James Spader fan this is one movie you must see.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Having seen Mulan at the movie theatre. It was so very good. I couldn't wait for it to come out in DVD. The Special Features are outstanding. The making of Mulan was exceptional. If you want to see a DVD movie with humor and heart. This is the movie to get.
B00006EXCC|5.0|Another great album by the Rolling Stones.  This one features 14 Jagger/Richards originals.  And they're all good, too, with some being better than others, of course.  All Rolling Stones fans should own Aftermath, but the question is: the US version or the UK version?  Well, the UK version has 14 tracks, compared to the US version's 11 tracks, so that would seem to answer the question right there.  However, the US version does have the hit \\"Paint It, Black\\".  But the UK version has the hit \\"Mother's Little Helper\\", so that's about an even swap.  I think the final word should go to the Rolling Stones themselves, who considered the UK version to be the way they wanted the album to be released.
B000022TSH|5.0|As little as possible! That's the best advice I can give to people who haven't seen this film but going to. The payoff is so much more rewarding when you don't know anything about the movie. The last 20 minutes of the film is a rollercoaster ride, just when you thought it's over, it's not. Just when you thought you're going to leave the theater with a smile on your face, your not. This has to be one of the most memorable extended endings in the movie history together with Seven and Casablanca to name a few.<br /><br />The performances are all phenomenal. Jack Nicholson gave the performance of his career. He gets to exhibit a range of emotions combining subtlety and intensity. Faye Dunaway has the perfect mystique to capture the character and she made it really touching and compelling especially towards the end of the movie. John Huston has the creepy evil vibe that's both disgusting and freaky.<br /><br />But the real star of the movie is the screenplay of Robert Towne. This is the best screenplay in movie history. Period. Overflowing with style but not in any way pretentious, compelling and deeply moving without being sentimental, mind-boggling without being contrived, and memorable scenes all through the movie. Perfection. But of course huge credit should be given to Roman Polanski who combine all this film making aspects and turn into a masterpiece unparalleled in it's genre up to this time.<br /><br />The DVD is a little disappointing, totally disrespected the film. A commentary would suffice but I guess we have to wait because this film is so much good it deserves better treatment in DVD. As little as possible shouldn't apply here!<br /><br />Grade: A+
B00005YXZH|5.0|Too many people told me to check out this album, and the name \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" kept following me around until I cracked and listened to it. It took a few listens to sink in, but many of the songs floored me and took me to another musical level. You could say that Wilco is the alt-folk version of Radiohead, since their blend of acoustic guitar, pop sensibility, periodical electronic blips, and abstract lyrics is completely noticeable within the first song, \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,\\" but they're their own band. Jeff Tweedy is one of the most heartfelt songwriters and vocalists of this generation, like Thom Yorke, however I find his lyrics harder to decode than Yorke's. The songs may be ambiguous in meaning, but the songs are fascinating and moving. \\"Radio Cure\\" is one of my favorite songs ever, and the line \\"Distance has no way making love understandable\\" is perhaps one of the best quotes about love since it speaks on so many levels. \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" and \\"poor Places\\" are also emotional standouts, alongwith the upbeat pop of \\"Kamera\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Drummer.\\" Even in their lightest songs, this record has an underlying element of darkness. I'm glad that so many people made me aware of this album, because YHF hardly ever leaves my CD player, or my memory for that matter. Pick it up if you want just a great record. Then you'll denounce Reprise Records for being stupid enough to care about commercialism than artistic integrity and innovation.
B00020QXU4|5.0|I bought this album for the single track \\"Indie Rock and Roll\\" and it's worth it.  I own the US version and it's great as well but I had to have that song. <br /> <br />Saw The Killers in concert in Ottawa, Canada and they were great.  I'm looking forward to a lot of great albums from this band.
B00008PX8P|5.0|When I first heard about this item to be released, I almost lost my mind, but was still just a little skeptical.  How many of us have purchased at a record show or through the internet a \\"European recording\\" or what most of us know as bootlegs of a Zep concert.  Show of hands please.  You in the back, don't be shy.  Usually grainy with horrible sound at best.  But it was still the band preserved on tape.  Anyway, I thought that the old shows would suffer from age and just the recording technology available back then. Then I opened up the great package and placed it in the dvd player.  Seeing \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" performed live is worth the price of admission alone but don't forget the classic Zeppelin catalog.  The greats from Physical Graffitti, \\"Kashmir\\" has to be seen and heard to be believed!  I live in Pittsburgh and missed my chance to see Zep live twice due to Family death or Bonzo leaving this world.  I had tickets for both and years later this is just an unbelievable package.  The video that Page worked on is just great and the sound, well, even better.  This deserves 101% if such a thing exists but I can only give it the 5 stars that are possible.  If you are a Zep fan, you already own this, don't you?  If not, run, don't walk to the nearest store because you don't want to wait days for the mail.
B0002858YS|5.0|What more can be said about the Killers that hasn't already been said?  This group from LV has really caught my ear, something that no new artist has managed to do since, the now no more, Big Wreck. <br /> <br />I first heard this band in my car on a battle of the bands show on my local radio station.  I enjoyed what I heard so I called and threw them my vote.  Ironically it turned out I was the only one who voted for them.  However things quickly changed as their first hit \\"Somebody Told Me\\" become one of the most requested songs ever.  Recently their second single \\"Mr. Brightside\\" had it's day on the battle of the bands, only it's fate would be much different.  It has now been just over a week and The Killers with Mr. Brightside are still the band to beat. <br /> <br />The best thing about this band is that their first single \\"Somebody Told Me\\" isn't even the best track on the album.  The entire album is great so it's a must listen.  If you get the chance check out the UK release of the same album for the single \\"Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll\\"  I love this tune it's got power vocals and some great music to go with it. <br /> <br />Last but not least, if you haven't seen the Killers in concert, check them out.  I saw them in Ottawa, Canada a few weeks ago and it was one of the best shows I have ever been to.
B00006G8G1|3.0|I've been a huge Maiden fan since I first heard their \\"Killers\\" album oh so many years ago, I believe it was 1981.  Even though they haven't done much in the past decade, a couple of useless albums with Blaze and the inconsistent \\"Brave New World\\" (We all were expecting something much better) and then the World Tour.  You just new Steve Harris was going to release another concert film of that tour.  Maiden just seems to equal the love of money lately and judging from the numerous times of reissues and greatest hits in the past, wants their fans to keep shelling out and boy do we ever.  All in the expectation of returning to the greatness they had when their 1st concert film \\"Live After Death\\" was released.  I think that was 1985.  This dvd has a great sound, great color and picture but it kills itself with the constant changing of images from the oh so many camera angles.  How I would have loved to watch any of the band take guitar solos and show it not a second here then a second here with constant shots edited at strobe light effect but in its entirety.  This is just too much visual information, it overloads my sensory system.  It is a nice memory of the tour of which songs were played and what they made \\"Eddie\\" look like on that particular tour.  Otherwise save your money and buy the CD.  Find \\"Life After Death\\" or \\"Maiden England\\" for an enjoyable Maiden concert experience for the eyes and ears.  I need to close my eyes and lay down after a half hour of this.
B0002SROSQ|4.0|Well, Nick Cave certainly knows how to suck you in. The follow-up to 2003's \\"Nocturama\\" is a solidly moody creation, a two disc set called \\"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus,\\" courtesy of the ex-Birthday Party vocalist and his new band, the Bad Seeds. One minute mellow, the next bombastic -- and it's pretty good stuff.<br /><br />Certain bands age well, and thankfully Cave hasn't lost his touch. Though only God knows how he manages to churn out an album a year without burning out like a blind moth. Let alone material that is decent in quality -- \\"Abattoir Blues\\" is a warped take on gospel music, complete with a thrilling choir in \\"There She Goes My Beautiful World.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's been a strange, strange day,\\" Cave moans in the first disc. But \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" takes a slightly different tack -- it's sweeter and more playful. After the heavy rock of songs like \\"Get Ready for Love,\\" the gentle pop of \\"Lyre\\" seems positively idyllic. The sprawling 10-minute finale, \\"O Children,\\" is a spookily beautiful composition that sounds almost prayerlike.<br /><br />\\"Nocturama\\" wasn't the best that Cave and the Bad Seeds could have done. Like a lot of good rock, it was good by objective standards, but not as good as he could've done. \\"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre Of Orpheus\\" fixes that -- it's just a resolutely solid album all around.<br /><br />Whirlwind bass and murky percussion mask the songs of \\"Abattoir Blues,\\" giving a sort of wild stormy sound. Even the lower-key songs like funky \\"Cannibal's Hymn\\" are spooky and weird. Things change quite a bit with \\"Lyre of Orpheus,\\" such as the opener of \\"Breathless\\" -- it's dominated by a gentle acoustic guitar and a flute. In the background of \\"Carry Me,\\" you can hear what sounds like a piano. The music sounds very textured and complete.<br /><br />And despite such brilliant instrumentation, it's hard to tell just how Cave can keep from laughing during some of the songs he sings here. Like \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" -- he sings about Orpheus crafting a lyre that kills Eurydice, followed by \\"birdies detonated in the sky/bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees.\\" Where do they get these wickedly deranged ideas from? But the lyrics aren't all goofy -- \\"Cannibal's Hymn\\" is morbidly creepy, with its \\"your heart that is bruised but bleating/And bleeding like a lamb.\\"<br /><br />What's best about \\"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus\\" is that both discs work as individuals albums. But taken together, they feel like a wild night out, and the lazy Sunday morning that comes after.- he sings about Orpheus crafting a lyre that kills Eurydice, followed by \\"birdies detonated in the sky/bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees.\\" Where do they get these wickedly deranged ideas from?

B000002X1O|5.0|Apparently this brilliant musical masterpiece came a few years too late at the wrong time in that boring singer/songwriter period where bland was in and musical genius such as this was not...a loss for the audience, not to mention great musical talent tossed aside for flavor of the day.  From the top it is clear this cutting-edge masterpiece is incomparable with everyone in peak creative form...Grace and Paul are an amazing musical force and that Slick voice is one of the \\"Unsung\\" greatest ever in the history of rock that has been amazingly and sadly overlooked. \\"Your Mind Has Left Your Body\\" is wondrous and Grace Slick is mindblowing & at a soulful peak in \\"Across The Board\\" which is a lost hit that should have been while \\"Sketches Of China\\" is an awesome finale to this wonderful musical journey.  Majestic flowing orchestrations along with masterful vocals will satisfy those who love creative rock at its finest! \\"White Boy\\" is an exhilarating rock anthem and a unique musical gem to experience...how was this amazing set of songs along with Slick solo masterpiece \\"Dreams\\" overlooked...little wonder the music industry is in such a mess as they don't get behind the great stuff and radio, pathetic silly trends of the day dominate. \\"Baron\\" and \\"Dreams\\" are both essential musical experiences and so damn happy these amazing works have been remastered and available now for us music lovers to savor and enjoy. Beyond compare and musical genius like this isn't happening anymore so enjoy. BRAVO to everyone involved with the creation of this great ride...
B00001PE4D|1.0|I found this movie to be appauling. There is a scene where Ryan Phillippe's character get's Selma Blair's character drunk and then sexually assaults her. She has the good sense the next day to know that something bad happened, but Sarah Michelle Gellar's character convinces her that, hey, it was a good thing because she orgasmed and suddenly she's part of a secret society. I'm sorry, but people are sexually assaulted every single day and it is never appropriate to show anything where someone might misconstrue what happened. I don't care whether these people get their cumuppence at the end or not, they raped her and what they did was wrong and the filmmakers made it look glamourous. I know that some people reading my review will think me a right-wing idiot who doesn't know that this was supposed to be interpreted badly for the two stepsiblings, but I don't have enough confidence in the intellegence of the populaiton of the United States of America to have the same interpretation. Both of those characters should have been put into jail for what they did. Being sexually assaulted is one of the most humiliating experiences someone can ever go through. It should have been shown that way because that's what it was. If you don't realize that when you watch this scene, then I'm not the one with the issues.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|A couple of weeks ago my friends and I went to the movies to see Team America. While it was funny, there was still something missing so we hopped over to the next theatre to see a film that we'd been hearing about at conventions: Shaun of the Dead. We had no expectations, only knew it was supposed to be a British comedy with zombies in it. It could have been very cheesy so we just sat there and and about half way through, we all realized this was one of the best character comedies we'd seen, one of the scariest films in a while and a truly heartfelt film about love and friendship. We were blown away and the fact that this film was dished over two hours of fun only made it that much better. This is a film that will be cherished for years. Give it a try, you might feel the same way I did.<br /><br />As for the dvd, I know the region 2 dvd contains commentaries, deleted scenes and more so I am hoping all of those features will be brought overseas too.
B000001FS6|3.0|Soundtracks occupy a rather dark and uncomfortable corner of the rock kingdom, and with good reason. It's no secret that film projects have long been the critical and/or commercial black eye in otherwise unstoppable careers - as freshly anointed Biggest Band on Earth U2 got its chance to learn the hard way with 1988's RATTLE AND HUM.     RATTLE AND HUM contains seventeen tracks, nine of which are new studio recordings, with another six drawn from US concerts taped during U2's 1987 JOSHUA TREE tour, as well as snippets of a streetcorner blues singer and Jimi Hendrix playing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\" If this sounds like a bit of a jumble, it is; and that's the problem. Had the studio numbers herein been released on their own, I have no doubt that RATTLE AND HUM (or whatever it might've been called) would occupy a respectable niche in the U2 canon as a solid, if inevitably lesser, follow-up to THE JOSHUA TREE. Much of the music is excellent, including the melodramatic shout of \\"Hawkmoon 269,\\" the brass-drenched soul workout \\"Angel of Harlem\\"(which I defy anyone to listen to and then try to argue against Bono's gifts as a singer), the Edge's haunting solo lament \\"Van Diemen's Land,\\" the droning and dreamy \\"Heartland\\"(possibly the best song I've ever heard with America per se as its subject) and the huge closing ballad \\"All I want Is You.\\" Collaborations with Bob Dylan (\\"Love Rescue Me\\") and B.B. King (\\"When Love Comes to Town\\") also work quite well, and along with the liberal use of horns, harmonicas, female backup singers and overtly bluesy melodies underscore the band's obvious desire to further its relationship with American music - a relationship begun (and arguably employed more successfully) on THE JOSHUA TREE.     Which brings us to the live material, source of most of the lambasting which both this album and its accompanying documentary took from critics and fans on release. To be sure, much of it is fairly lamentable, either due to lackluster performancesor, more often, Bono's embarrassing onstage patter. Covers of \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" don't exactly make the listener forget the originals, while a gospel rendition of \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\\" though musically strong, seems more to simply bloat the version on THE JOSHUA TREE than add very much to it. The same could be said of much of the movie, which is largely devoted to celebrating the glories of THE JOSHUA TREE as explored - and exploited - on tour, and with only a couple of exceptions features the new studio songs either in snippets or in different, for-the-cameras versions. This makes RATTLE AND HUM the album and RATTLE AND HUM the film two very different things, with the former's considerable strengths undermined by the inclusion of just enough in-concert bombast and cinematic filler to make it awkward. That doesn't stop this from being an essential album for U2 fans, however - indeed, even the film doesn't look all that dreadful anymore, after sixteen years of increasingly execrable MTV-inspired outrages and the rise of a sneering trash culture of adolescent auteurs. If nothing else, RATTLE AND HUM reminds us that the good old days, even when they weren't great, were an order of magnitude better than almost anything we've got now.     RATTLE AND HUM brought the 1980s to an ambiguous close for U2; still one of the world's most popular rock acts, the band had suffered its first real body blow right in the wake of its greatest success. This also meant a very unambiguous end to the '80s version of U2. The band would disappear for three and a half years, to return in an almost unrecognizable form and ready to scale new heights.
B0002S94BG|5.0|_Grace_ has been my favorite album for about a year now. When I heard about the remastered legacy edition, I was apprehensive - the production on the original version is perfect; its dynamics fit perfectly with the mood and atmosphere of the album itself. The good news is that I have no problem with the remastered version. Anyway, I didn't care so much about the production - I always have the original copy to fall back on. I was mainly interested in Disc 2 of this release - the rare, b-sides stuff or whatever that Buckley fans will buy this album to hear.<br /><br />So, is it worth getting this album again to hear Disc 2? My answer is a resounding 'yes'. \\"Forget Her\\" is a beautiful piece that sounds like it was a hidden track on the original version of _Grace_ (in fact, I believe it was supposed to be included on the album, but was taken off at the last minute for a reason unknown to me). It has the same \\"feel\\" as everything else from the album (aka: the song is freakin' awesome). The alternate take of \\"Dream Brother\\" is quite interesting, and reminds me of the live version from _Mystery White Boy_. Buckley's cover of \\"Mama, You've Been On My Mind\\" is a wonderful little tune.<br /><br />The very Gospel/doo-wop song \\"I Want Someone Badly\\" is pretty sweet (complete with lady background singers doing little \\"oohs\\" or \\"wops\\" or something - it reminds me of the Back To The Future ice cream parlor scenes). The \\"road version\\" of \\"Eternal Life\\" is intense and heavy - it's so metal. I think there are even a couple of harmonics and/or pull-offs (!), plus the \\"death\\" breakdown before Buckley wails \\"WHAT IS LOVE!\\" Great stuff!<br /><br />The centerpiece of the second disc, though, is \\"Kanga-Roo\\", a brooding, 14-minute epic that for some reason reminds me of Tool jamming away. The song is played on the \\"Live In Chicago DVD\\", and I love that version for its intensity and \\"live\\"ness, but this version is totally supreme. The buildup is even more intense and wrenching, and Matt Johnson's drumming is even more amazing (which is probably the reason the track reminds me of Tool).<br /><br />Basically, if you like Buckley and want to hear more of what he was capable of, get this ASAP. If you don't have _Grace_ (for whatever stupid reason), just go ahead and get this. And just to make this review a bit longer, I will now paste my review for the original version of _Grace_ (in case someone hasn't heard it and is wondering, since I've concentrated on the bonus stuff):<br /><br />\\"Jeff Buckley released but one fully realized album during his all-too-brief stay with us on earth, but that album is one of the most passionate and spiritual albums I have ever heard. Imagine a fiery young singer/songwriter who is influenced by the likes of Led Zeppelin and The Smiths. Oh, and this dude has the most amazing voice ever. Also imagine his band (bassist Mick Grondhal, drummer Matt Johnson, guitarist Michael Tighe) knew his playing inside and out and acted more like a backing band for John Coltrane or Miles Davis than a traditional rock ensemble. Then you have a rough idea of the amazing album known simply as _Grace_.<br /><br />_Grace_ beings with the beautiful \\"Mojo Pin,\\" fading into a soft guitar line along with Buckley's gentle crooning. With Zeppelin-esque intensity the track grows stronger and louder to it's climax. The wonderful guitar work ties the song together while Matt Johnson's drumming accentuates each change of pace. \\"The welts of your scorn, my love, give me more/Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more\\" Buckley's singing builds, \\"Well it's you I've waited my life to see/It's you I've searched so hard for,\\" soaring into the ether with the last phrase. This flows into the next track, \\"Grace\\", which serves as a beautifully fiery compliment to the atmospheric \\"Mojo Pin.\\" The climax found within is glorious, with sweet guitar strumming and then Buckley belting out with incredible emotion: \\"And I feel them drown my name/So easy to know/And forget with this kiss/I'm not afraid to go\\" His voice now more intense than ever, nearly screaming \\"But it goes so slow\\". He holds the last note for what seems like an eternity.<br /><br />The Gospel flavored \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" moves from a harmonium opening to a solemn acoustic guitar backdrop grounded by Grondahl's tasteful bass playing. Over the sweet Hammond organ and the R&B styled backing vocals, Buckley builds the song to a desperate crescendo: \\"It's never over/My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder/It's never over/All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her,\\" his own fine guitar work adding to the beauty of the lyrics, \\"It's not too late.\\"<br /><br />The highlight of the album comes with Buckley's emotionally-jarring rendition of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\". It is as if Cohen wrote the song specifically with Buckley's voice and style in mind. As tender as the heart that broke to write this song, just Buckley and a guitar, he confesses to us: \\"Well maybe there's a God above/But all I've ever learned from love/Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you.\\" The song is impossibly gorgeous - easily one of my all-time favorite songs. A minimal stripped back performance but with such a spiritual, devotional vocal. It has been known to draw tears to the eyes of lumberjacks.<br /><br />_Grace_ has this incredibly spiritual, romantic feel to it that I can't describe. Buckley's extreme intensity and emotional sincerity make _Grace_ what it is - a flourishing achievement in every conceivable way.\\"know/And forget with this kiss/I'm not afraid to go\\" His voice now more intense than ever, nearly screaming \\"But it goes so slow\\".

B00005JMXX|4.0|This movie has a real chance of becoming a cult classic -- yes, it's just that different.  The Day After is probably best seen hung-over.  Here's the plot: global warming affects the Atlantic currents (possible) and that affects the temperature (possible) which causes the world to delve into an ice age in a matter of days, sending us all the citizens of the Northern Hemisphere begging for shelter in the Third World (possible if you drink enough).  Every home should have a copy.  And, they say our math and science status continually slips!  Just wait till the world sees this baby.......
B00005JKC3|1.0|But I wouldn't be surprised if it sells enough dvd's to make a profit. A somewhat confused plot, overlong action scenes & outrageous over-acting. Add to that a poor edit job. The fight sequence between the dogs & The Hulk seemed to take forever. The special effects were cheesy. I'm stupid. I sat through the whole thing. Rate this one D for mindless drivel. <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|The first time I heard this album, I was a bit disapointed in the lack of stereotypical, big-base beats that Im used to hearing on the radio and MTV.  But, this is not your stereotypical hip-hop album.  Kanye takes the genre on an unworn path with soulful riffs and lyrics that make you nod with the beat, and often in agreement with his messages.  Listen to the guest artist's lyrics on Spaceship and be blown away by his powerful words and amazing flow to the beat.  Last Call, even though its more of a walk through of Kanye life than a rap, lets you in on his struggle and provides a riff that makes the unusually long track go by in seconds.   <br /> <br />All in all, College Dropout I a sigh of relief for those of you who are a bit tired of the David Banner, Lil Jon scene, but still enjoy rap.  This is a CD that you will nod your head to from beginning to end, and not feel drained afterwards from sensory overload.  It expands on all levels, instead of regurgitating hard base with lyrics about pimpin and dubs, and grasps inspiration from a number of genres to provide a listening experience even non-rap enthusiasts can enjoy. <br /> <br />Great beats, great rhymes, funny skits(with an actual message behind them!), and alot of heart.  Kanye and the rest of the rap world will have trouble topping an album of this quality
B0001MDP3G|4.0|All the elements are here. The time & place: The Civil War in the South, a perilous life & death journey by the hero & a romantic love story. It is also long  (2 1/2 hours) by today's short attention spans. Add another hour for \\"the the making of...\\" feature at the end. It is time well spent.     The stars came up with some of their best work considering Jude Law(Inman)is English & Nicole Kidman (Ada) is Australian.  They both play Southerners convincingly to my untrained ear.    Briefly, Ada & Inman fall in love virtually in a matter of days. The war comes & Inman leaves. Weeks turn into years. Yet they both remain steadfast. The war is obviously lost & Inman deserts, starting his long odyssey home. That is the focus of the movie. Will he make it? Is he dead? Probably. But Ada never loses hope. Another story is the relationship that develops between Ada & Ruby, a kind of goofy role for Renee Zellwegger. She is a woman who appears out of nowhere to help Ada, a southern belle with no pratical skills, keep her home during the war. They develop a strong bond of friendship.     The backstory & interviews on the dvd are interesting & instructive. It goes into some detail comcerning a real life incident that happened during the war. Federal troops dug a long tunnel under a fortified rebel position. They loaded it with explosives & blew it up. This is considered the greatest man-made explosion in history up to that time. It is reenacted in the movie.     The bittersweet ending becomes obvious before the end but, all in all, an excellent movie.
078401213X|5.0|This is a very stylish film that deserves more attention from film viewers. I've read some reviews about this film and I was upset to find some people that did not like the film because of some camera techniques or the non sense of the story. First of all, although in many scenes the camera shakes a lot, tilts, and uses unusual angles, the effect of this only adds to the insanity that is going on in the movie. The story is meant to be paranoid, painful, disorientating, stressful for the main character Max Cohen, and the effective use of camera angles brings the audience into the movie. If you felt nausiated by it, it was meant to make you feel that way. Second, the story if of course non sense because cleary the stock market, Pi, and the Kabalah has no significant similarities. Instead of focusing in on the technicality of this, why not focus on the character who is obssessed about finding those similarities? Thirdly, some one pointed out that this movie was cheaply made, and it is true that this movie had one of the movie industry's lowest budget. However, the director geniously turned that disadvantage into an advantage to create something that is totally unique. I really cannot say anything negative about this movie except for near the ending where I thought needed more explanation, however, that discovery was only for Max Cohen, so we don't really need to know what happened but the fact that he did come up with some kind of a revelation. Anyways, great film, and I would definately recommend this film to anyone.
0070511136|4.0|Read it. Read it again. Read it a third time. Much of the information (minus the constant put down of other sales training books within the work, reason for the 4 and not a 5) is incredible. Easy to read. Simple to implement. As a long time sales professional I have read many sales oriented books over my career. This is definitely on top of the \\"technology type\\" oriented books. I am in automotive sales and sometimes the principles do not transfer very well. This book is okay for my business. Along with this book, I would prefer any car salesperson (pro or green-pea) buy \\"Cars and People: How to Put The Two Together\\" before they work on my lot.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Thank God for DVD.  I didn't know about the show when it aired on TV, but a friend bought me the DVD set for my birthday.  I was up until the wee hours of the morning night after night because I just couldn't wait to see what would happen next!  The only disappointment is that I ran out of episodes before I ran out of interest!  The special features were great, too. Can't wait for the movie!
B0002858YS|5.0|Like a refreshing blend of The Cure and The Smiths, The Killers debut is a breath of fresh air.  A solid listen from start to finish, and highly recommended.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Most of my friends had seen this movie, and told me to steer clear. But I am a fan of the Hulk, as well as director Ang Lee, so I opted for a rental just to quell my curiosity. I have to say that I was quite amazed. Did my friends watch the same movie I did? I think that if you approach this movie with a lot of preconceived notions of how it should/will look, then YES you WILL be disappointed. The Hulk is a cerebral approach to a superhero, and Bruce Banner's psyche. That really makes for a much deeper movie than one might think. BUT when he does 'Hulk Out', the violence is graphic, vicious, and darn satisfying. What I didn't appreciate with this movie are the multiple floating panels that show action from many points of view. A novel idea, but over used and distracting. Thankfully, Lee doesn't use these incessently, but enough so they can aggravate. At the very least, rent this movie. Give it a chance. It is beautifully done, and the CGI Hulk is impressive and expressive. I can usually spot CGI animation from a mile away, but the Hulk worked. He conveyed very subtle emotions effectivly. Check it out!
0312995423|2.0|<br />Well its an easy read - the pages flow pretty quickly. But you can just scan the chapters - and pick out the important bits. <br /> <br />it is a shame that David Cheats death on so many occasions - that it looses all credibility. Some of the computer 'geeks' were so stereo typed as well......and who are these people who go to work on saturdays when they don't need to. <br /> <br />None the less a good holiday read. <br /> <br />
B00003CXV4|2.0|Myself and a couple of my college buddies were watching tv the other day and on was Sweet November. Of course we have heard of this film before, but it most certainly did not intrigue any of us. Yet, this time was different, Keanu was the worst he has ever been. There seemed to be nothing behind his eyes, just nothing. Does Keanu pick his own roles, or just the ones he thinks are really not for him. Theron does an ok job in this flim, but she is no Monster. Well, i would suggest never watching this movie, unless your significant other states that they must see it. I mean...my college friends sat through it.
0440234743|5.0|Troy Phelan, womanising billionaire, commits suicide leaving his fortune to an unknown daughter, Rachel. She is hiding from life in the Pantanal wilderness area of Brazil and wants the money even less than she wants to be found. Meanwhile, Phelan's other, more or less legitimate, children are joined together in a wild legal battle for their late father's fortune. Phelan's long-time lawyer wants nothing more than to honour his client's wishes and sends Nate O'Riley to find Rachel and bring back her signature so that he can defend Phelan's testament.<br /><br />A fast paced novel that leads to an almost perfect conclusion. I was a tad disappointed with the ending but wouldn't change it. This novel also provides early evidence of Grisham's growing softer side evidenced by Skipping Christmas and Bleachers.
0312995423|4.0|Susan Fletcher and her boyfriend David Becker are unknowingly linked together in a life or death struggle that they may not win. She is working in the NSA cryptography division and he has been asked to fly to Spain and pick up the key to a 64 bit cipher. He doesn't know what he's looking for and she doesn't realise what danger he has been put in. The NSA must recover the key or face the consequences of an unbreakable code being released to the world resulting in an end to their days of decoding missives.<br /><br />With more twists and turns than my broken washing machine this book makes up in action what it lacks in knowledge. At times, Brown's lack of computer knowledge comes through but overall it is more than passable. He does a good job of creating an intricately woven plot that doesn't fail to deliver although the ending is more deserving of a movie than a novel. Perhaps a film version is on the way.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I saw Jeepers Creepers in the theaters on the date of its original theatrical release.  Considering that audiences have been dealing with Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and other slash flicks, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Needless to say, I was blown away.  The music that was played during the surprisingly brief opening credits creeped me out early on, and I remained horrified throughout the remainder of the film.  It opens with siblings Trishia and Darry driving home through the country for their Spring Break.  I won't get too much into details as not to ruin this for anyone who has yet to see this film(anyone?).  However, this movie succeeds on so many levels.  No, the murderer is not your mere Michael Myers, or Jason Vorhees... he's the \\"man\\" right out of your darkest nightmare.  He sticks to the shadows throughout the film, and when he is revealed he only becomes even more terrifying.  Another high point of Jeepers Creepers is the well developed bond between Trishia and Darry.  These characters aren't paper, they're real people who viewers should be able to get behind.  And it's very easy to see the movies through their shoes, and to feel their fear.  The conclusion is the best I've seen in a horror film, and I certainly left the theater in shock... and didn't sleep until 4 in the morning.  The DVD extras are excellent.  Several cool features, deleted scenes, an interesting commentary and things like that.  Check this one out!
B0002VEW1K|5.0|Note: This review is for the Friday Music remaster. For some reason, amazon puts this review in with the Salvo remaster as well. Comments on that follow as two reviews on essentially the same recording are not permitted.<br /><br />Exotic Birds and Fruit was originally issued at a time when disco fever was beginning to sweep the AM radio charts and at a time when imaginative music got increasingly less airplay on FM as radio business consolidations standardized playlists across the country.<br />I remember buying it the day it arrived in the record store and rushing home to put it on. Immediately, I recognized the songs on side 1 of the album as being as good as anything the boys had issued to this point. Side 2 of the album was played less as I felt at the time the songs were somewhat weaker.<br />With CDs, listening to a recording is a whole new experience. Sure, you can skip songs you don't like and easily replay those you do without the hassle of getting up to move the needle. But I tend to listen to the recording in its entirety which often gets me to hear a song I once did not care for with new ears. Such has been the case with the Friday Music reissue of Exotic Birds and Fruit.<br />First of all, the sound is of excellent quality. Secondly, Friday Music tempts the Procol Harum fan with a couple of bonus tracks. Nothing But The Truth, Beyond The Pale, and Strong as Sampson still rate among the band's best songs but after hearing this well-made remaster, I have a new appreciation for The Idol, Fresh Fruit, Monsieur R Monde, and Butterfly Boys. I still don't much care for The Thin End of The Wedge but that is no demerit for this. Of the two bonus cuts, the band's magnificent rendition of Strauss' Blue Danube waltz stands tall, particularly during keyboard solos.<br />Whether you are an old-time Procol Harum fan or a Procol-curious newcomer, you can't go wrong adding this overlooked classic to your CD collection.<br /><br />June 20, 2010:<br />Well, its clear that amazon has screwed up again in not fixing the product information despite appeals by disgruntled buyers to do so. The Salvo Records reissue being sold does not include a version of Blue Danube. Instead, you are provided with an alternate mix of As Strong As Samson. BFD!, I'd rather have Blue Danube. But even if you already own the Friday Music remaster, I say go for the Salvo as well. Why? For the six-panel digipak packaging and the booklet which is chock full of pictures and info about the band at this period in its career. The Salvo booklets are classic and not to be missed!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Take a step away from the movie and you will see what this one is all about. It's really not about the safety of the American People.  It's really not about whether or not Governmental leaders did this right or that wrong.  It's all about one thing: Michael Moore!  Masquerading as a concerned citizen, Moore supposedly leads viewers on an \\"expos&eacute;\\" of truth, justice and the American Way!  But look deeper and you will see that this is all about a flawed movie maker who, very likely, as a young man couldn't get dates!<br /><br />Chuckle!  Laugh!  It's nothing more than political standup by a mediocre comedian.  And don't forget to shovel out the dough to support Mr. Moore in what amounts blatant rudeness masked as art. Moore is the sort that invites his audience to accept his crude, overbearing \\"humor\\" because if they don't he says their the ones who are stupid!<br /><br />Relax!  Moore's fifteen minutes of fame is almost up.  The sad thing is that his brief moment in the sun leaves him nothing more to do than laugh all the way to the bank!<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
B00006AG5N|5.0|This compilation contain 30 tracks that had been number one hits in the pop charts in Britain, America or both, together with the JXL remix of the hitherto obscure A little less conversation, which made the total 31. As others have noted, the remix created a whole new generation of Elvis fans although I had been a fan for many years previously.<br /><br />The set is presented in approximate chronological order, beginning with his rock'n'roll hits of the fifties including the hard-rocking classics Heartbreak hotel, Hound dog, All shook up and Jailhouse rock along with great ballads like Love me tender.<br /><br />After a spell in the army, Elvis returned to the music business but he recorded more ballads and his new up-tempo songs didn't rock quite as hard. Some people lost interest in his music at this point but I enjoy music from all periods in his career. His sixties music was different from his earlier rock'n'roll but was, if anything, even more successful, at least to begin with. The classic songs from the early sixties include It's now or never, Are you lonesome tonight, Marie's the name of his latest flame, Can't help falling in love and Devil in disguise.<br /><br />As the sixties progressed, Elvis became an actor. Although some of his soundtrack music was brilliant, Elvis lost his way as far as hit singles were concerned. In the mid-sixties, he topped the UK charts with \crying in the chapel but the sixties were nearly over before Elvis again returned to the high places in the singles charts on a regular basis, although very few reached number one in Britain or America. Suspicious minds and The wonder of you are perhaps the most famous of them. Way down, the last of his original number one hits, was in the charts but not doing much when Elvis died. Within a few days, it shot to number one in Britain. It seemed unthinkable that Elvis would ever again reach number one in the pop charts, but then came that re-mix.<br /><br />By following the charts strictly, some classic songs such as Blur suede shoes and Always on my mind are omitted while less famous songs such as Too much and A big hunk o love are included. However, all the classics omitted from this collection have been included on another compilation, 2nd to none. You can therefore get all the essential Elvis tracks via these two compilations but even without the other compilation, this is a great introduction to the music of Elvis.ictly, some classic songs such as Blur suede shoes and Always on my mind are omitted while less famous songs such as Too much and A big hunk o love are included.

B000002LHT|5.0|As i understand why people don't like this album it is among one of my favorites: Can't Get you outta my mind, I Believe In Miracles and the best one Pet Sematary are all great songs. <br />When In DOUBT <br />Whip It OUT!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Exactly why this particular album became a huge international success while other, equally brilliant, albums sell only in small quantities will remain one of life's mysteries. Maybe it is the blend of jazz and pop with a little country thrown into the mix although there is nothing new about this - it happened throughout the 1940's. Listen to Jo Stafford, Dinah Shore, Margaret Whiting or the Dinning sisters, to name just a few singers who did just that. Of course, most people these days are unfamiliar with the music of these wonderful ladies. So young people think that Norah represents something new while older listeners see Norah as a revivalist of their kind of music.<br /><br />The music is kept simple. Norah sings and plays piano, supported by guitars, bass and drums with some tracks featuring extra instruments such as organ, accordion or strings. . The songs are mainly originals written by Norah or her musicians though there are three oldies. Cold cold heart (Hank Williams) certainly sounds different from any previous version I've heard and it's brilliant. The nearness of you (a Glenn Miller classic written by Hoagy Carmichael) features Norah singing and playing piano without other musicians - lovely. Turn me on is a John D Loudermilk song that I've never heard before (and I've heard several songs that he's written) but it's great so wherever Norah found this, it was an inspired choice.<br /><br />The album overall is very relaxing, dominated by ballads. This makes it ideal for a romantic evening but also leaves it open to criticism that all songs sound the same by people who don't appreciate it. I love this album and if even a fraction of Norah's fans are encouraged to explore jazz vocal music or 1940's pop music further after hearing this album, even better.
B00009Y3L4|2.0|I don't get it... This movie has been praised for years, and I can't stand it! I think Liza Minelli is awful. She can't sing, she can't act, and she's not even that marvelous of a dancer - what did she win an Academy Award for, exactly? Effort? There's plenty of that - it's like she's trying as hard as she possibly can to sing like Judy Garland, act like Barbara Streisand, and just coming off as annoying. Joel Grey is good, I'll warrant, but extremely creepy (I still have nightmares about him, I swear) and Michael York is... well, Michael York. Does he ever actually act in films? I've yet to see it. The musical numbers have been butchered, the plotline destroyed, and the message completely lost. I'm appalled that Kander and Ebb approved of this ghastly reimagining of their wonderful score... It all just makes me sad. If you want to hear a fabulous version of \\"Cabaret\\", check out the 1998 version. It's much richer and full of ACTUALLY talented people. Sorry everyone who is a fan, but frankly this movie sucked.
B00005JLTR|5.0|If you've never seen this movie, I have to wonder where you've been.  I've been watching movies for years, and I'm very picky...This is a great rock and roll love story.  What could be better???  Give it a look, you'll be happy you did.
B000001ABD|5.0|I almost gave this album only four stars because it lacks ISN'T SHE LOVELY from 1976's SONGS IN THE KEY OF LIFE. But since Stevie Wonder is one of the biggest-selling R&B artists,I decided to give it five. I JUST CALLED TO SAY I LOVE YOU is one of my all-time favorites. I also love MY CHERIE AMOUR,SIR DUKE,PART-TIME LOVER,OVERJOYED and LOVE LIGHT IN FLIGHT. This album also lacks GO HOME and THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR from Dionne Warwick's FRIENDS album. That song is a quartet number between Wonder,Warwick,Gladys Knight and Elton John. This album does have EBONY AND IVORY,Wonder's duet with ex-Beatle Paul McCartney and from McCartney's TUG OF WAR album. When Wonder guest-starred as himself on The Cosby Show,he did a duet with Clair Huxtable(Phylicia Rashad) singing I JUST CALLED TO SAY I LOVE YOU. Wonder started and gave Rashad the words,speaking,starting with the second verse. That episode was entitled \\"A Touch Of Wonder\\" and first aired on the sitcom's network NBC on February 20,1986. I also like FOR YOUR LOVE from 1995's TALKING BOOK. Wonder is undoubtedly an R&B hall-of-famer. His show business career spanned forty-one years.
B00005JNEI|1.0|If you like complete garbage mixed with fantasy, fiction and a side of bovine (...) then this is the movie for you.<br /><br />On the otherhand if your looking for something thats an actual documentary, I would suggest looking elsewhere.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This is an awesome album! It spawns two Top 20 hits,SIR DUKE,a tribute to the late jazz great Duke Ellington and ISN'T SHE LOVELY?,a great jazz piece. I love the sound of that harmonica he plays.
B000002L9J|4.0|The Queen is Dead is obviously the Smiths' most critically acclaimed album, but unfortunately, i feel it is a bit over-hyped. Don't get me wrong, it IS good, but I think there are a couple so-so songs that bring it down. It starts of well, establishing some of the music heard throughout: layers of jangling guitars, over the top vocals, and samples from british culture and art.  \\"Frankly, Mr. Shankly,\\" is a great song with a neat little instrumental section and amusing lyrics. But the next two songs, \\"I know it's over\\" and \\"never had no one ever\\" are both good in their own right, but also quite slow. When placed in a row as they are, they really wreak havoc on the mood and interest level of the album. Once these are through, the listener is treated to a few of the Smiths' best songs, including the hit \\"bigmouth strikes again\\". Yet unfortunately, another clunker is thrown into the mix! \\"Vicar in a Tutu\\" is a song that is pretty annoying even the first time you hear it. Its a fun song that I've finally accepted after many listens, though i initially thought it was much out of place sitting between the two prettiest and deepest songs on the record. It ends brilliantly, with another silly song (but one that this time fits the mood better)\\"Some Girls are Bigger Than Others\\" which has a great guitar jangle from fade-in to fade-out to fade-in to fade-out. Overall, its easy to forgive the missteps because of the high points in even the worst songs. And the mood in general hangs together well. But i dont think it can truthfully live up to the \\"unforgettable classic\\" kind of hype it often gets, especially from the British Press. I probably wouldn't recommend this as a start for getting into The Smiths either, considering there are several decent singles collections to choose from. To sum up, the album is great, but it isnt perfect.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The latest edition to the Harry Potter movie series has been the most view-worthy. Alfonso Cuaron brings an elegant artistry to the third film that Chris Columbus was sadly lacking in the first two. The cinematography is interesting, the acting remarably convincing, and the score positively exhilerating. Truly, this film surpassed all my expectations. Some complain that the movie left too much out, but frankly thats ridiculous. Cuaron captured the spirit of the book with incredible dexterity, and I may point out that while Columbus remained technically faithful, the overall energy of the book was lost. I highly recommend this movie to the average muggle but especially to devoted Harry Potter fans.
B000002GBB|5.0|On PIECES OF EIGHT, Styx make a major statement that it's better to be true to yourself than to be a joiner and a follower, a message which inspired me to skip my old school's food-related reunions in favor of looking good for a number of pretty actresses in the wake of my disapproval of some of what was being taught to students there, even if some alumni sided with my parents against me on certain things as a result. The best songs here are by Tommy Shaw; \\"Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)\\" is an anthem about determination to succeed against the odds, and I've sometimes endearingly compared a girl's braided hair to the rope that the narrator is facing in \\"Renegade\\" (although the outlaw-facing-the-gallows reference could be an allegory about pressure to conform rather than be an individual), which, like \\"Blue Collar Man\\" has the stamp of Montrose and Ted Nugent, as well as Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Outlaws, all over it. Dennis DeYoung's best numbers here are \\"I'm OK\\" and \\"Queen Of Spades\\", while James \\"JY\\" Young, the only one of the three singers in the band whose voice truly reflects what I was taught happens to a boy's voice as he becomes a man, takes the lead on \\"Great White Hope\\" and \\"Lord Of The Rings.\\" PIECES OF EIGHT, despite its deep messages, is Styx's hardest-rocking album, which made me need to talk to my therapist about how to cope with DeYoung's slide into Barry Manilow territory on the follow-up. Shaw's and DeYoung's advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this album, which is Styx's best overall, cut even deeper.
B00031TXBI|4.0|There's no doubt that John Frusciante could keep coming out with albums and keep everyone and anyone happy.  His basis is not to be complicated, but to be expressive.  Everyone of his albums is a true expression of John at his currents state of mind.  This is another great album with more of John being great.  It still has the same general feeling of his recent albums but a different approach to those feelings. I'd recommend it to anyone.  John is a pure musician
B000068FWC|5.0|BREAKFAST IN AMERICA was Supertramp's biggest-selling album ever, and it was also their fourth great album in a row, as well as the second artistic peak of their musical career. \\"The Logical Song\\" gently mocks the educational system in a way that inspires me to put my weight-loss goals above my desire to go back to food-related functions at my old school, but there are other great songs here, too, including \\"Gone Hollywood\\", \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", the title track, \\"Take The Long Way Home\\", and \\"Just Another Nervous Wreck.\\" The only drawback is that the hard rock edge present on their breakthrough record, CRIME OF THE CENTURY, is somewhat absent here. It would have been acting a bit like the stepmother in A CINDERELLA STORY to expect the group to sustain this winning streak given the tensions within the band, and in fact, they never again equalled this album, with Roger Hodgson departing after two more releases.
B000002GFT|5.0|Few albums truly merit the overused 'seminal' tag, but 'Liege & Lief' can stand proud among the best of 'em.  <br />This, Fairport's best album by a country mile, played a lead role in kickstarting the British folk rock movement and it remains a key point of reference for lovers of the genre.  <br />Rest assured, there is not a duff track on this masterpiece. If you get to the end of the opener, 'Come all Ye' without indulging in some serious foot-tapping, then the album's instant magic clearly hasn't woven its spell on you.  <br />What follows is a veritable banquet of classic song after classic tune. This is the sound of a band at a creative peak and the album sounds as fresh and vital now as it did upon its release, all those years ago.  <br />Buy this, and then tell your friends to buy it too. They'll thank you for the recommendation.
B00008BRBG|5.0|The Police debut with a bang on OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR, their debut album. Most of the songs are excellent, and they would improve over the next two albums, peaking on ZENYATTA MONDATTA and then declining quickly as far as artistic viability is concerned, even though SYNCHRONICITY was their biggest seller. Get this one, REGATTA DE BLANC, and ZENYATTA MONDATTA first.
B0002S94OS|1.0|These guys are weak and trust me, i have given their albums a try and it didn't do it for me. Not only was \\"ashes of the wake\\" rushed? But also was over produced and the riffs are pure crap and boringggg!!! Most of these \\"all american metal\\" bands are horrible...Example? Godforbid,killswitch engage,unearth,lame of god, are all pretty much mediocre. Insted? Give shadows fall's latest \\"war within\\" a try and you will not be let down. Listining to mediocre music is pathetic.
B000002GB9|5.0|THE GRAND ILLUSION is the first Styx album where they attempt to deal with social issues affecting the U.S., in this case the idea that listening to the media will give you happiness forever. This album has inspired me to become more independent when deciding what music to buy, as did the follow-up, PIECES OF EIGHT. You should get this one, EQUINOX, CRYSTAL BALL, PIECES OF EIGHT, and PARADISE THEATER, unless you just stick with the anthologies.
B00005JMEW|3.0|The first half of the movie is awsome. The music, which Mr. Trarntino always uses to perfect effect, rocks. But it's when Ms Thurman arrives in Japan that is \\"falls\\" apart. The flying limbs and gushing blood. Sorry, it reminds me of a Monty Python movie.
B00005JMUA|1.0|\\"Kill Bill, Vol. 1\\" was simply AMAZING! If you're expecting the same kind of fun gorefest that \\"Kill Bill, Vol. 1\\" was, prepare to be dissapointed. Not only was this ghastly abomination not nearly as violent, it wasn't even interesting. In fact, most of the movie is just talking! This is hardly what I expected from a movie that I was anticipating ever since I stepped out of the theater after \\"Vol. 1\\" If you MUST know how the \\"Kill Bill\\" saga ends, rent this one, but you won't want to see it more than once... and oh yeah, get ready for the most anti-climatic ending ever.
B0002F1CO6|3.0|This is a two CD set re-release of Universal Migrator and Dream Sequencer, which were separate albums back in 2000. Universal Migrator is supposed to be heavier and Dream Sequencer more keyboard driven and atmospheric.  <br />Instead of multiple singers per song, Arjen has one main singer per song. This is where it goes wrong. The singing styles and sometimes the mixes are different enough that it is uneven, especially on the Universal Migrator CD. The guitar and keyboard are still good, however. Russel Allen sings Dawn of a MIllion Souls, which is my favorite song on this CD. Russel is one of my favorite singers and Symphony X is one of my top three fave bands, so it sets a standard that leaves me somewhat disappointed afterward.  <br />This review and my opinion are actually my own fault because I started my Ayreon fixation with the new Human Equation, which is absolutely amazing (except for one song) and Star One Live. The Star One Live CD has live versions of Dawn of a Million Souls and Into the Black Hole, easily the two best songs on this set. The live versions are slightly faster and more intense and Dawn of a Million Souls has a slightly different arrangement. The keyboard and guitar intro to Dawn of a Million Souls is inspired and awesome on both versions, but I like the live version better. <br /> <br />
B00062IDCO|3.0|they hadn't gone with a Chakotay-Seven romance.  UGH!  That, and they shouldn't have turned Janeway into a hard whatever.  The writers should have had Chakotay plant a big one on Janeway as they entered the Alpha Quadrant.  That would've been cool!  All us J-C'ers would've been happy then.
B00008X5J3|4.0|Because the last one, very eccentric and strange, captured my interest so deeply I bought the tape later on. But Chicago it`s worthwhile, being funny and dynamic.Don`t miss it.
B00005JMXX|3.0|A good popcorn movie, \\"Day After Tomorrow\\" features eye-popping special effects and a familiar cast.  Dennis Quad, looking more frozen than all the ice around him, is a scientist who warns the world that hell is about to freeze over.  Great special effects ranging from tormadoes to one huge title wave, and a brisk pace keeps things moving along nicely.  Forget all logic, just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|This is another movie I was excited when I saw the trailer. Much better than the first part in the sense of special effects and action choreography. The movie was just flat out good, but if i had to pick one thing that kind of bothered me, it was that Bourne decides to start having flashbacks (this movie takes places on year after the the Bourne Identity) about his first ever mission just out of the blue... i found that kind of weird. If you want to kit pick how this movie doesnt follow the book and blah blah blah, ask yourself, how many movies have? This movie is worth owning, especially if you liked the first part, the story is well told, the action is great, as well as the acting, and the plot.
0790729628|2.0|Blade Runner is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. This was the first DVD I ever bought. To say I was disappointed with the 'Director's Cut' underscores my disgust. I saw the original theatrical release of this film several times back in the day. It blew me away! The effects, the atmosphere - everything is perfect. I know a lot of people here prefer the 'Director's Cut' but I gotta tell ya, IT SUCKS!     Give me the original any day. The narration is excellent despite Ford's claim that he didn't even seriously try to read the lines. Put the violent scenes back in just out of principle, I am damn sick of edits! (Read my other reviews)...    TECHNICAL:    I agree with other reviews about the dated technical aspects of this film. We desperately need a 'special' edition with dual-layer anamorphic widescreen and the choice of either 'Theater' or 'Director Cut' versions like on the \\"Independence Day\\" DVD. Better yet why not release a high bit rate edition (like Superbit), no movie has ever been more deserving of this treatment than 'Blade Runner'.
B00005JMXX|2.0|well, i was bored, and it was on sale at wal fart, so i put it in the shopping cart, not knowing really what to expect.      I could repeat what a lot of earlier reviewers have already stated about the lack of logic, woody acting, etc., however, i'll decline.    About the best thing about the DVD was the sound.  Whoever created the DTS soundtrack for the movie did an awesome job,   especially with the cold and the wind.        However, the wolves really annoyed me as they had no context in the story whatsoever.  I could understand the animals in the zoo getting upset as supposedly animals know when something's wrong with the weather, but swimming wolves was just too much.  Why did she have to get cut anyway?    also, if i knew, which they did, that i was walking on a building with a glass roof, i would have gotten off of it as soon as i could.  How heroic the guy was to sacrifice himself so the others could survive.    the movie was quite boring.  Unlike his other movie, id4, it was not even interesting the first time you watched it.    oh well.  I like to play it loud, b/c it scares the crap out of my cats.      However, the absolute worst part of this dvd would have to be the \\"special features.\\"  You are out of luck if you don't have a cable/dsl connection AND it is still slow.  They could have put it all on the dvd itself, but i think 20th century fox wanted your name and email address so they could see how many people bought this or something.  these are even worse than the movie itself.

0812968255|5.0|Many people are disappointed with Stoicism, calling it emotionally narrow and unsatisfying. Indeed, it seems ridiculous to us now, when kissing our mother or spouse so say to ourselves \\"I am only kissing a human being\\", so if those people die, we will not be attached to them, and therefore feel no loss. This is what Epictetus, the man through whose Discourses Marcus Aurelius learned the principles of Stoicism, advised one to do in his Handbook.  <br /> <br />That being said, I feel that there are few works that have ever been more rewarding for me to read. The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius are amazing on two levels. The first is that of a philosophical doctrine, the level on which it is usually considered. The Meditations can be seen as sort of a run-on of the Epictetian brand of Stoicism, which is different in many aspects from early Greek Stoicism. If one (for the most part) likes what Epictetus has to say in the Handbook, but doesn't really feel like sitting through the Discourses, Marcus Aurelius is a nice alternative.  <br /> <br />The second level is that of a personal struggle. Most people don't admit it, but the reason that Marcus Aurelius stays with the reader more than Epictetus does is because in Marcus Aurelius the reader sees a man with an enormous amount of power in his hands wrestling with himself, trying not only to do his job correctly, but live correctly as well.  <br /> <br />The Meditations are very intimate, and could be considered a sort of philosophical diary, but for some reason, they never really get this treatment from readers.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this not only to students of philosophy, but to students of Roman history and political science as well. How many times in history do we have a written account of what it takes to be a good emperor? Most of all, however, I would recommend this to anyone struggling to find inner peace, not that I'm suggesting that it should be taken in a dogmatic manner, but at the very least, a troubled mind will find a companion in Marcus Aurelius.  <br /> <br />As for the translation, I have not seen another that even comes close. This book is worth every cent of the price and much much more. <br />
B00000DGUG|3.0|I personally think this is Alanis Morissette's worst album. It's not really bad-far from the worst album I've ever heard-but it really just...isn't that good. It can't live up to the standards of her other three. The only truly memorable song is the radio hit \\"Thank U,\\" which I really, really enjoy. Very beautiful song. To this day, one of her better ones. Also, the opening track \\"Front Row\\" isn't bad. \\"Unsent\\" is incredibly bizarre in that it is pretty much spoken word-it's like poetry. None of the lyrics rhyme. It's literally like she's writing a letter. And yet...incredibly....Alanis manages to make it into a song. The background music is very pretty, and it actually has a beat. I actually like this one, too. I'm impressed she was able to make that one work! Very emotional, and yet somewhat settling. \\"So Pure\\" is also pretty good. Nice beat. Sadly, pretty much everything else here is very dull filler. Alanis fans should probably own this, because its enjoyable tracks are really nice. Yes, it is Alanis's worst album due to its ballad and filler-heaviness, but that's not saying much because all of her albums are pretty darn good. For what it's worth, her voice her is far more developed and far less aggravating than it was on Jagged Little Pill-but nothing here is quite as fast or catchy. Like I said, its enjoyable tracks \\"Thank U,\\" \\"Unsent,\\" \\"So Pure,\\" and \\"Front Row,\\" really shine and are enough for me to award this album 3 stars. But like I said, musically, she has better.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I loved every song and the CD gets high rotation in my players and has for the past year. High quality music with engaging lyrics. My bias was that of a Rage Against the Machine fan that disliked them for breaking up and not at all a fan of Soundgarden. Now I get Chris Cornell and love this group for having been formed in the first place. Great music - I recommend this to everyone.
B000067CPX|5.0|I think Frusciante is having a good influence on the band, 'cause this sounds like their best work to date. They finally transcend that lumbering \\"ooga-chakka\\" sound that is their unfortunate hallmark. The group is finally old enough not to pander to expectations, and they deliver haunting, memorable music. High points: the shimmering rhumba of \\"Cabron\\", Frusciante's Satriani-esque solo on \\"Don't Forget Me\\", the nuclear-powered Californian convertible \\"By the Way\\", the \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\" reprise \\"Throw Away Your Television\\", the glowing sparkledust love of \\"Warm Tape\\"... actually, it's pretty much all good. This is album is the sound of a big fat endorphin rush.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Listen to that last guy, St. Thomas! <br /> <br />Anyways, this was a fun action movie to watch, and that Kate Beckinsale was pretty damn hot.  Did girls back then really look that good?  Ha Ha <br /> <br />Dracula's always been a good villian, and of course those Werewolves!  The scenery was pretty awesome, and we had some comic relief with that Friar character. <br /> <br />All in all, a fun movie to watch on a Friday night.
B000059Z8M|5.0|It's not often a sequel comes along that is as impressive as the original.  This is true even for Disney (remember \\"Son of Flubber\\"?).  However, \\"Toy Story 2\\" follows up the hit \\"Toy Story\\" by giving the impression that Disney really knows what it's doing with this theme.  The idea is a good one; what do toys do when no human is around to play with them?  The answer that we found in \\"Toy Story\\" continues with the further antics of Woody and Buzz Lightyear.  This time they again leave home on a mission of rescue.  It's just as hilarious as \\"Toy Story\\" and just as heart-warming.  Along the way we meet some new characters by the names of Jessie, Bullseye and Stinky Pete.  However, we retain the original cast that we have come to enjoy.  Their personalities, their feelings, their interdependency, and their humor are what makes each of the \\"Toy Story\\" movies work so well.   <br /> <br />Like its' predecessor, \\"Toy Story 2\\" is a movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family and that is really saying a lot in this day and age.  Disney was known for its' ability to produce family movies but it, too, has slumped somewhat in recent years.  However, \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Toy Story 2\\" show that they can still read the book they wrote when it comes to this genre.  Kudos as well to Pixar who has teamed up with them on both movies.  If you don't like this movie, you don't like life.
0451527046|5.0|At School 10 in Troy , New York many years ago Miss McGovern led her little mateys through a reading of this children's classic. I do not remember exactly what she had to say about Captain Silver and Jim Hawkins , whether she felt the cunning and dishonest old curmudgeon Silver was somehow a sympathetic soul, and young Mr. Hawkins was a very worthy and wily apprentice. I do know that around about the same time the Big Screen showed a version of this tale which brought it more vividly to life. As a child I could not exactly understand why Captain Silver had to be ' bad ' at all, and what exactly Mr.Stevenson wanted for us. The treasure , the map , the finding of booty did not appeal very much to my young soul, and to tell the truth the whole tale seemed more like yet another ' adult trick' to make ' children' feel interested in 'school'. The rousing yarn that has held the attention of so many largely confused me. In this one however my guess is my own childhood impressions are pretty well of the mark, and do little justice to a book which has given so much suspenseful pleasure to young readers.
B000055ZB8|5.0|The original Dracula(names changed) film.  Very well directed.  The atmosphere definately drives this classic horror film, and what a job it does.  This film definately makes a chill go down your back.  A must watch
0425180638|5.0|I thought this was a well written tale. I enjoy reading all of Patricia Cornwell's work. If you are a fan, or a new reader of her stories you will not be disappointed.
B000056N8X|2.0|This film is the 4th film in the highlander film franchise.  It plays out more like the 1st film of the highlander tv franchise, being a expansion of the TV show in certain ways. <br /> <br />The movie is pretty good in certain aspects: The acting is pretty good (Although the villian was over the top), the fight scenes are pretty good (Donny Yen rocks!), and the music isnt too bad. <br /> <br />However, this movie suffers from TERRIBLE direction.  Sometimes, you will catch scenes they put in here from the 1st movie(There is one part where a car is driving on a bridge taken from it)!!  At other times, you will see Duncan use the same move in a fight twice.....because they just rewound the film and played it over again!  The plot is muddled and inconsistant, hardcore fans will be able to point out this.  Special effects are done poorly and look like something out of a 80s B movie.  The whole \\"Conner vs. Duncan\\" fight scene did not stir my senses whatsoever.  At that point, I was still trying to figure out if this film was made as a college film class project. <br /> <br />The DVD also comes with a special \\"early cut\\" of the film.  After viewing it, I think there was some scenes that could have been put in the final cut, but others are quite poor and I could see why they cut them out.  Oddly enough, \\"cut\\" scenes are also available on the dvd.  Keeping track of all this will be like a homework assignment. <br /> <br />I love the Highlander TV show and the 1st movie, and I had issues with this film.  Rent it first, then decide if you want to buy it.
B000268QB2|5.0|My God, this CD is awesome! This release is nothing short of masterful!  The songwriting is top notch, with dreamy, soaring vocals and music that flows through your very consciousness.  This is THE perfect release for driving down a secluded, winding, backcountry road.  Saw them live in Cleveland, and it was one of the best concerts i've ever seen.  So much ENERGY and HEARTFELT music!  Can't wait for their next release!
B000063DFQ|5.0|This is one of the best metal cds ever.  Top 3 on the best Iron Maiden cds as well. <br /> <br />1.Where Eagles Dare-Awesome riffs and long solos! <br />2.Revelations-Cool song that is about the bible(?) <br />3.Flight of Icarus-BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM, one of the best Iron Maiden songs period. <br />4.Die with your Boots On-Kind of a filler track, but still kicks! <br />5.The Trooper-Nuff' said!  Anyone who likes maiden knows this classic. <br />6.Still Life-Kind of a Ballady track, but still good I think.  Intresting melodies in the middle of the song <br />7.Quest for Fire-The only song I kind of dislike on this album.  It isnt horrible though.  Its a song about cavemen. <br />8.Sun and Steel-\\"Sunlighhhtt, falling on your steel, death and life is your ideal, life is like a wheel!!\\"  Catchy song and chorus about a samurai warrior.  One of my favorite songs on the cd. <br />9.To Tame a Land-The \\"Epic\\" track on the album (Ex. Phantom of the opera, Rime of the Ancient Marnier, etc.), lives up to its reputation.  Its a song about the Frank Herbert book \\"Dune\\", and being a fan of the books, this song has alot of special meaning to me.  The lyrics are moving, melodies and riffs make you think you are in the middle of the desert riding a worm, I love this song!  Its a pity Frank Herbert would not approve this song to be called \\"Dune\\". <br /> <br />Buy this cd NOW!!!!
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon 5 is one of the best bands which emerged on music scene this year. After a small failure at the very beginning of their career, Maroon 5 did not give up, and re-released \\"Songs about Jane\\", with all the promotion that this record deserves.\\"Harder to breathe\\", \\"This love\\" and \\"She will be loved\\" are songs which are getting lots of airplays on radio these days and are conquering positions on charts all over the world. One of my favorite songs is \\"Sweetest goodbye\\" and I really wish it becomes a single. If you like pop music, give it a chance, and buy \\"Songs of Jane\\".
B00003CXCT|3.0|To all those fans who have questions regarding the deprogession, and degridation of society throughout the Star Wars storyline, you have to look at world history. As the, \\"Empire\\" begins its conquest of universal domination is destroys everything in its path in order to state the message that they are an all powerful, (forgive me) force. Much like Adolf Hitler during WWII. It's known as a scare tactic, much like what was displayed in Episode IV with Princes Leia. As for this, \\"newly revised\\" Lucas piece, I have to say as a fan of the original version, I am most displeased with the addition of Anakin from Episode III into Return of The Jedi, and the removal of the original, newly released from the, \\"dark side\\" Anakin. Also there is a scene in Empire, that is clearly and truly degrading where Vader talks to The Emperor in the asteriod field. Just watch you'll notice. Lucas merely took his almighty power and changed his original films, to some how try to satify the miffed fans who felt the storyline didn't add up. Thus Lucas said, \\"what the hell\\", and threw in some CG here, and changed some lines there. What's the harm? Much harm. Much harm indeed Georgie...
B00009V7RF|4.0|I must admit, I was a bit hesitant to listen to this CD after seeing the hype they had received on MTV and top 40 radio stations. Rap and hip-hop have taken a turn for the worse in the past years, and the Black Eyed Peas are no different, right? Wrong! Black Eyed Peas may be the only artist, besides Outkast and a couple others, that actually deserve the attention they receive on the radio and MTV. Their mix of Jazz, Hip-hop, Rap, R&B, along with their knack for writing conscious lyrics, make for a very unique and enjoyable listen.<br /><br />The albums opener \\"Hands Up\\" serves as a fine intro. \\"Labor Day (It's a Holiday)\\" is equally enjoyable, also featuring a Public Enemy sample. \\"Smells Like Funk\\" is one of my favorites. \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" has the most addictive chorus on the album, describing the loss of control when dancing, or getting high. If you think they are making of the physically challenged, try using your brain, and realizing a fun loving group like Black Eyed Peas would never make fun of such a thing. Other standouts include \\"Hey Mama\\" and \\"Where Is the Love?\\".<br /><br />Overall, I can see why this album has received all the hype, since it's so poppy. Every once and awhile you do find some good hip-hop in the Top 40, and this is it. I think it's time for me to go \\"Get Retarded\\".
B0006213WG|5.0|I've had this c.d. for about two weeks now. And have listened a 1000 times since. &quot;Chuck&quot; kicks ass!! No doubt about it. It's an amazing progression of their new punk/metal style that made it's debue with &quot;Does This Look Infected&quot;. <BR>Why does this album blow me away? To get started, the way it opens; the melow &quot;Intro&quot; progesses amzinly well into &quot;No Reason&quot;, starting off with the intro of Deryck talking, right into the crowd of &quot;HEY!&quot; to get you stuck in the song, straight into Steveo's driving snare roll speeding up the song setting it off with all fire-arms with Deryck's &quot;Lets Go!!&quot; I could go on... <BR>Next up; Brownsound's shreds the metal core guitar on this one,along with his 80's metal guitar solo influences, he destroyes the guitar on this album. It's descusting!! Stevo's drumming gets better with every album, tons of snare rolls and fills on this one once again. And with a stronger reappearence of his Double Bass abilities shines through on tracks like &quot;I'm Not the One&quot;,&quot;The Bitter End&quot;,&quot;Welcome to Hell&quot;,and &quot;88&quot; with quick 16th and syncapated triplets. Love Stevo's druming on this album. <BR>Every song on this album is sick, they're all really good. Though &quot;Some Say&quot; uses the same chord progression and structure as &quot;All Killers&quot; &quot;Handle This&quot;. It' still a whicked song. The strings sound great on the c.d. aswell!! It's also a nice change and progression in the band itself. This whole album is. Though it's still Sum, 100%. Deryck's singing gets a lot better with each album aswell, on stage and in recording. I love a lot of heavy music to, and the break-downs and heavyness of this album rocks. Songs like &quot;We're all to blame&quot;,&quot;The bitter End&quot;,&quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;,&quot;I'm Not the One&quot; and &quot;88&quot; all have amazing and heavy metal break-downs.<BR>Anywayz, buy this album, I recomend it to any Sum fan, or any rookie fans, thsi album is discusting and I meant it. 100%.<BR>Hope this helps you out, NOW BUY IT!!<BR>I Whipe My Bum with Sum Fartie-One<BR>You guys chick ass!!!<BR>E KA HI!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|I have to admit I was disappointed with Yo-Yo Ma's last album, \\"Obrigado Brazil\\", which uneasily and unwisely mixes his unparalleled cello playing with a wide panorama of somewhat incompatible Brazilian music. Fortunately, this time around, his vast musical curiosity pays off with this beautiful recording, a splendid tribute to the film music of composer Ennio Morricone. Produced by the composer himself, the disc has a langourous, often romantic quality that immediately evokes the films they represent. I heard it as I was browsing at my local Virgin Megastore and immediately knew I wanted to own it.<br /><br />The most impressive aspect of this album is that it's not a simple replay of the scores but an actual reworking of these familiar themes into new symphonic arrangements which sound as if they were composed specifically for an orchestra featuring a cello soloist. The album offers eight tracks, which combine music from different films by the same director (e.g., Sergio Leone, Brian de Palma) into a series of suites, as well as providing shorter arrangements of individual themes. Most of Morricone's most popular melodies are here, in particular, pieces from \\"The Mission\\", \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" (almost too briefly represented here) and the main theme from \\"Malena\\". It's all quite superb as the recording melds together in a dream-like way. Accompanied ably by the Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra, Ma is in top form throughout, subtly capturing all the rich emotions in each piece. Granted the music does have a certain monotony of tone that makes it ideal for playing in the background, this is nonetheless a virtuoso performance by all concerned. Strongly recommended to anyone who loves film scores rich in aural beauty and visual recollection.
B000001GQY|4.0|I have changed my opinion of this CD set over time. I initially felt that it was excellent, and I do still feel that Gilels plays quite well, with very even fingering and clarity, and that sound quality is good.<br /><br />But I have come to realize that these performances are rather slow, and seem dull compared with others. For example, I think that the Rubinstein/Reiner 1954 recording of the 1st is much better; more vigorous, spirited, and dramatic. I also prefer the Richter/Leinsdorf recording of the 2nd concerto - a more fleet and powerful recording than Gilels/Jochum.<br /><br />If you like your Brahms dreamy and broadly expressive, I think you will like this CD set. But if you prefer more exciting performances with no loss of beauty, there are better choices.
B00005QK3W|5.0|OK, half these songs are ballads, but ballsy, fully fleshed out ones!  Top quality McCartney melodicism and fine lyrics.  The rest of the album rocks in a loose jamming sort of way that McCartney rarely gives himself up to, at least not since the early 70's.  \\"Riding into Jaipur\\" is a beautiful tribute to George Harrison a month before his passing.  That's the key to this album:  disciplined ballads juxtaposed with hard loose jamming rock, and it really sounds FRESH!!!  It's the best Macca album since Flowers in the Dirt or maybe since the 70's! (Not counting his spectacular LIVE albums!) CHECK IT OUT & HANG LOOSE!
B0000027RL|4.0|Ten is a very good album.  It's not great-but it's still very good.  Sometimes some of the songs can get boring and unless you're a die-hard Pearl Jam fan, you're probaly not going to listen to this album much.
B000060P79|5.0|At one time punk was a vital, subversive and relevant force in music and in culture in general..along with old school hip hop,punk changed the face of music, making us hear music new ways but also helping us remember what rock and roll was about in the first place. Many of the early punk musicians were rejects, misfits and discards who instead of going into a criminal direction found self expression in music. As a result it became a platform for young people to address the plasticity and hypocracy in our culture. It was a rebellion against the bombastic exesses of stadium rock and the idea that you had to be a virtioso musician to play rock and roll. It was about DYI and gave rise to the indepedant record label which fascilitated an explosion of underground music. But like with original rock and roll, disco, and rap, the beast that we know as the major record companies got punk in their greedy clutches and sanitised and homogenised it, making it palatable for the mass consumption, sucking out the very spirit that made it so cool in the first place. A Simple Plan is is this corporate doctrine in its purest from. A band consistting of clean cut yet whiny suburban whitebreads performing poppy jingles that emulate punk. Even the title of the album is downright absurd. Just balls? I am hearing the song \\"Perfect\\" in my head and trying to equate it with \\"Just Balls\\". Am I missing something here?. The purpose of being in a punk band is to piss off your parents. Pissing off your parents is in a lot of ways a right of passage. Like MXPX, Green day and Blink 182, these little pups are anything but punk. Having a mohawk and skate board doess't make you the real deal. Like George Bush all decked out in pilot gear on that aircraft carrier voguing as some kind of warrior, thes kids are what used to be refered to in the punk world as \\"posuers\\". Hell, these wankers couldn't scare my grandma! Punk Rock was music made by real punks in the true sense of the word. The members of A Perfect Plan fit more in the \\"Dweeb\\" category..Perhaps they should call it \\"Dweebcore\\"
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I have a hard time telling others about this disc because I cannot effectively express how I feel about it.  Totally blows me away more and more each time I listen to it.  It is in my nature to try to punch holes in these kinds of things... find its weaknesses...  figure out a way not to like it so much.  But I just can't do it with this one.  It is standing up to all the tests for sure.  By far my favorite of the year, if not the past 10 years.
B00006879E|4.0|Like a painting of a beautiful woman `Songs About Jane' evokes an obsession, feeling, and pure desperation mixed with love and loss.<br /><br />I initially bought the CD for the track, `This Love' that reminded me of a rocked out version of some Barry Manilow song, which I enjoyed listening to, and loved the arrangement. As albums go it's good, very few albums today are filled from front to back with songs liked or even loved by all that listen to the CD. If an artist or band can get as many hits as these guys have they'll be ecstatic.<br /><br />The album is filled with lots of R&B undertones but is absolutely not R&B but a great mix of Rock and R&B. My favorite tracks are those that include heavy key boards and R&B back-up vocals like Rashida Jones and Mystic. By far my favorite tracks from this album are `Must Get Out', `Sunday Morning' (listen carefully for Mystic in the background after the second line, sexy can't begin to describe her voice), and `Sweetest Goodbye'.<br /><br />The lyrics are divine in my humble opinion. Each line of each track was filled with desire, regret, longing, and sex. How can you go wrong with lyrics like this?<br /><br />`Where you are seems to be as far as eternity'<br /><br />`Sunday morning rain is falling steal some covers share some skin'<br /><br />`The sex she slipped into my coffee'<br /><br />Sultry doesn't begin to describe the emotions sparked by a woman named Jane.<br /><br />girldiver:)
B0000028M7|5.0|...So? Thats what grunge is all about, is it not? Alice In Chains were a very different band, yet they still managed to be awesome. Before I review this album I want to say that I like ALL the grunge bands, and even though I am a huge Nirvana fan I still love Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains. And what Alice In Chains had that the other Seattle-based bands didn't have was pure heavy metal mixed with grunge. These guys were some of the most depressing and dark people that ever formed a group. Thats why I loved their music, because I do prefer heavy metal over alternative and these guys manage to mix both genre's into one, definately something me nor any other metal band member could accomplish. I also love Cantrells guitar playing, as a guitar player he is one of my biggest alternative influences.  <br />   Okay, this album is a heavy/alternative so you damn teeny-boppers may want to steer clear of this. I personally find this album to be, well, I'll start off by saying its obviously dark, gloomy, depressing and grungy. Its also dirty, frightful and slow, even though sometimes it feels like the songs are being shoved into your ears 100 MPH. The songs here are anything but soothing, they vamp me up and get me ready for, well, anything but the same day they could just get me depressed to the point where I wont do anything. This album is very moody and is not for the casual rocker. <br />WARNING: Hardcore Grungers ONLY!
1592400876|3.0|The first punctuation mistake in \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" by Lynne Truss, a British writer, appears in the dedication, where a nonrestrictive clause is not preceded by a comma. It's downhill from there.    The foreword contains another comma-free nonrestrictive clause (\\"I feel no such sympathy for the manager of my local supermarket who must have a cellarful of apostrophes he doesn't know what to do with\\") and a superfluous ellipsis. The preface includes a misplaced apostrophe (\\"printers' marks\\") and two misused semicolons: one that separates unpunctuated items in a list and one that sets off a dependent clause. About half the semicolons in the rest of the book are either unnecessary or ungrammatical, and the comma is deployed as the mood strikes. Sometimes, phrases such as \\"of course\\" are set off by commas; sometimes, they are not. Doubtful, distracting, and unwarranted commas turn up in front of restrictive phrases (\\"Naturally we become timid about making our insights known, in such inhospitable conditions\\"), before correlative conjunctions (\\"Either this will ring bells for you, or it won't\\"), and in prepositional phrases (\\"including biblical names, and any foreign name with an unpronounced final `s'\\"). Where you most expect punctuation, it may not show up at all: \\"You have to give initial capitals to the words Biro and Hoover otherwise you automatically get tedious letters from solicitors.\\"    Parentheses are used, wrongly, to add independent clauses to the ends of sentences. Citation form varies: one passage from the Bible is identified as \\"Luke, xxiii, 43\\" and another, a page later, as \\"Isaiah xl, 3.\\" The word \\"abuzz\\" is printed with a hyphen, which it does not have. It opines that when a sentence ends with a quotation American usage always places the terminal punctuation inside the quotation marks, which is not so. (An American would not write \\"Who said `I cannot tell a lie?'\\") A line from \\"My Fair Lady\\" is misquoted (\\"The Arabs learn Arabian with the speed of summer lightning\\"). Some conventions of British usage employed in \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\\" are taboo in the United States-for example, the placement of commas and periods outside quotation marks, \\"like this\\". The book also omits the serial comma, as in \\"eats, shoots and leaves,\\" which is acceptable in the United States only in newspapers and commercial magazines.    [Note: This review is abridged from that of Louis Menand, in the New Yorker.]
B000000WF0|5.0|Urban Hymns surprised me. A friend and I were listening to \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\", and I decided to check the rest of the album out.  <br />  Instantly, I was mesmerized. 'Sonnet' especially, at that time, seemed to be my theme song, and I thought I understood everything Richard was trying to say. Ashcroft's lyrics have a way of touching you, it seems. Whether it's positive or negative, they grab your attention. <br />  Everything seems to run together smoothly. 'The Drugs Don't Work' is one of the most beautiful songs on Urban Hymns.  <br />  This album has quite a diversity, as well. From the pop-sounds of 'Bittersweet Symphony' to the unexplainable 'Velvet Morning'. It is breath-taking. I suggest everyone to check this album out.
B00063MBU8|3.0|Ok I don't want to start any flame wars but I've noticed something lately on Amazon. You people may sit here and complain about \\"That Pop crap\\" or other comments based on lyrics. I would like you to do something for me and it will only take a second. Think of the people bands like Simple Plan, Good Charlotte and the like are targeting. They are aiming to rope in teens who don't care if the \\"Band sounds tight\\" or how \\"Flowing the lyrics are.\\" These kids want to listen to music they can relate to. In the lyrics, they want to be able to identify with what is being sung. They want to know that other people are experiencing the same ups and downs as they are. If you don't like the subject matter then don't buy the cd. If the lyrics aren't inteligent enough then don't listen. You can't have inteligent and thought prevoking lyrics for kids to listen to. The fact is bands like SP are hear to caitor to the younger generation. I read countliss reviews that bash a band. Hey they aren't out to be completely serious. If you want that, go to the indy labels. I just don't understand why people knock certain music when it's clear who the target audience is. It's like someone going to a commedy who never laughs. It just makes no sense. Just so you know, I don't think the CD is great but it accomplished what it set out to do. Give the teens something to listen to. Sorry for the rant.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I can see why this would be a kick in the groin to some Beck fans, but Sea Change, put simply, is astounding. The guitar work here is like an oxymoron, so beautiful and uncanny.  <br />  The lyrics are blunt at times, and others, so very cryptic. And, even sardonic. 'The Golden Age' opens the album up, with the lyrics, \\"Put your hands on the wheel - Let the golden age begin\\", which to me, is a sarcastic remark. <br />  Beck's voice is extremely different compared to past albums. At times, it sounds like sordid, muffled mumblings. It is clear that he poured his soul out for us to see on this album. <br />  But, beware. If you cannot tolerate slow, moody songs (especially one after another), you most likely will not enjoy this wonderful piece of art.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I love popcorn movies and I enjoyed both Mummy movies because they knew not to take themselves too seriously and had actors who knew how to act and play well off each other. I don't know what went wrong with Van Helsing but its should be a crime for a movie of this nature to be this bad. Most of the actors in the film can't act their way out of a paper bag with the excerption of Huge Jackman and he does not give a very good performance in this movie at all. The special effects are great but they don't have a story to support them and the whole script has so many plot holes and inconsistencies that you can drive a truck though them. The characters are not very likable at all and you really don't care if they live or die. The villains are more cartoonist than scary and the climax goes so overboard that you really can't understand what is going on from time to time. I like a good popcorn movie just like everyone but Van Helsing so bad that you really can't understand what you are seeing and stay interested in what is going on.
B00005JLKB|5.0|First of all, I don't watch much television, partly due to a lack of time but also because there just hasn't been anything that appeals to me. I read Superman comics as a kid and the character still appeals to me, but the pointless \\"Lois and Clark\\" series left a bad taste in my mouth for Superman-related programs. I was vaguely aware of \\"Smallville\\", but it wasn't until I found myself with nothing else to do but watch television that I finally saw an episode, and I'm glad I did. It was entering its fourth season by then, but suffice it to say that I now watch it every evening in syndication. <br /> <br />So why do I like it? Well, its strengths are the acting, the production values, and (here's the big shock for me) the writing. The characters are likable and believable; they're not the stock characters that populate pretty much every television program, but are interesting and sympathetic. That's particularly impressive when you're starting with such well-known (and potentially one-dimensional) characters as Clark Kent and Lex Luthor. I also have really enjoyed the stories and I think the idea of having Kryptonite endow people with different powers and ability was a very clever one. On the other hand, that theme is also perhaps the series' biggest weakness, as the \\"Kryptonite-mutated bad guy (or girl)\\" concept has been overused a bit. <br /> <br />The bottom line in my opinion is this: the people who created this series \\"get it\\" with respect to what makes Superman a great hero. It isn't his powers; it's his character. It's not what he can do that makes him great but who he is as a person. That's why the series works: because this show isn't really about a strange visitor from another planet doing super feats, but about how Clark Kent grows up to be a super man.
B00008EY65|5.0|...as one of the greatest comic book hero movies.  This longer version makes a lot more sense that the theatrical version.  The extras are also very cool.  Biographies of the characters flesh out the story a lot more... and be sure to check out the Pancake comic, it's bizarre yet awesome.  There's also a weird Easter egg in the DVD menu you should look for.<br /><br />How often does a funny-looking guy like Ron Perlman get to be such a dashing romantic lead?  Not very often, but it works so well in the movie, and it works even better in this extended edition.  If you like the movie in the theatre, you should at least try to rent this new version.  It's a lot of fun.
B00005QCYD|5.0|ok this one is the bomb sooooooooo totally better then the first to if this thing would let me do it but i cant i would rate it 50 stars because it has alot of action and a good story. my favorite part was when the t-rex and even the bigger dinosaur fought against each other. its a really good movie a may be shorter then the other two but its the best one of all the animals are smarter too. also this island is isla sorna where they land on site b. if i were you buy this one too! jarrassic park 3 is the best to far will have to see what the forth one is about.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|i think this is an awesome dvd, specially for the fact that it's from an era when pink floyd were still that \\" elite\\" band in terms that they werent popular the way they became after dark side so that's make the dvd a great and really cool window to a very misterious and kinda unknown period of a great band. <br />The atmosfere created in songs like echoes ( part one must be one of the best stuff i ve' EVER heard in my life) careful with that axe, eugene and the rest of the stuff is just amazing, an undeniable display of good music from a band at his top!
B00008DDXL|5.0|this movie is even better then the first and a movie that everyone should get i think daniel radcliffe is a awesome actor and a perfect character for this part it makes the movie even more interesting to watch when he plays it. mabe its because hes the star of the movie. anyways this movie is great its a wonderful movie for the whole family to watch so if you dont have it now then you should get it.
0156027321|4.0|I enjoyed the Martel's book in many parts (who doesn't love a story with a 450 pound tiger named Richard Parker?!), but I must admit that I was a little disappointed. It was billed as a book that would compel the reader's belief in the divine, which is the direction it seemed to be going in at first (Pi, the main character, spends much of his precocious childhood enlisting in 3 different religions), but then it morphed into a survival tale somewhere between that of \\"Alive\\", \\"A Perfect Storm\\" and \\"The Jungle Book\\", and it never went anywhere near the realm spiritual inspiration or debate as I had hoped.  <br /> <br />Upon finishing the book, I couldn't find more than an ancillary need for the first portion of the book to exist, at least not in partner with the rest of the story. As someone whose belief system is a conglomeration of different religions, the promise of a tale so dramatic that it demands readers to believe in something was a big drawing point; however, if you're about to pick up the book for the same reason, be prepared that this desire won't be quelled. <br /> <br />That said, I still think the book is of value (especially for the questions it raises at the end) and is certainly entertaining. I agree with prior reviews that its comedy is forced at times, but overall I enjoyed becoming acquainted with Pi and following him through his trials.
B00006F2TV|5.0|cool movie when it first came out in theaders i watched it once but then it came out i watched it like 50 times and i knew that it would be a awesome movie to get it has many features on it oooooh this is a good movie one of my favorite movies ever! so if i were you i eould get it too!
B00003CXAA|5.0|...I'm curious about why it is that the special commemorative coaster that comes with the set has an older-looking Al Pacino on it.  Is this from a deleted scene from one of the two Godfather movies?  I, personally, would have preferred it if this coaster (wonderful gift, by the way) had featured a still from one of the more famous scenes, but what do I know?  It still does a fantastic job of providing for me a place to set my drink while I watch the two Godfather movies.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|i love this movie its so funny and its like a fairy tell ha i always loved watching it all the time my favorite character was the donkey who was eddie murphy anyways kids would love this movie even grown ups so this is a movie that you wanna get for the whole family.
B00005JN4O|4.0|By the time Johnny Depp receives his due, it will be long overdue. There are many elements of beauty in this film; Depp's performance as J.M. Barrie, the author of \\"Peter Pan\\", is one of the most moving.     In thinking back over some of my favorite of his performances: \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\", \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Chocolat\\", \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", among others, I was trying to distill the reason why there is not a \\"Johnny Depp\\"-identifiable role-- a typecast part which we all recognize Depp must play. And yet, when Johnny Depp plays a role, it becomes impossible to imagine it being played by anyone else. Depp seems to be a genuine romantic in his real life, and that may be part of the something special he brings to the souls of the characters he plays. They are \\"romantic\\" in the classical sense. Somehow he leaves this jaded, too-hip, too-wise-and-world-weary world behind in bringing to life characters who are rarely motivated by cynicism, but who are open and susceptible to the splendid draughts and drags of emotionally large and tumultuous or tiny and subtle events. His eyes are magic. He is a spellbinder.     The cynical may well be uncomfortable with this movie. It is, after all, about the power of \\"believing\\"--- and pretending---, about a playwright who did not want to grow up, but who recognized to the fraction of an instant when the dividing line between childhood and adulthood had been crossed. On the other hand, if you have the genius, as did J.M. Barrie in this story, to scatter a child's view throughout the theater of your perception, then the pure romance of the biographical story (\\"inspired by true events\\", but not necessarily true events) behind the story of the creation of \\"Peter Pan\\" is wonderfully transporting.     Evocative music, unabashedly old-fashioned and romantic, was my first clue that I had come to the theater ill-equipped. I was going to need Kleenex, and I had none. The characters are played by exceptionally beautiful people: Kate Winslet is lovely and likeable as Mrs. Llewelyn-Davies, widowed mother of the boys who became the inspiration for Barrie's most famous play; the luminous Julie Christie as Mrs. du Maurier, Mrs. Llewelyn's mother, is almost our hero's antagonist in opposing Barrie's involvement with her daughter and grandchildren, and yet her motives are understandable; the Llewelyn-Davies children, especially Peter, played by Freddie Highmore, are people we would like to meet and have as friends almost from the instant they appear on screen. Even Barrie's poor wife (Radha Mitchell), supportive when his previous play flops, then neglected in favor of his muse and inspiration for his greatly successful play \\"Peter Pan\\", is a sympathetic figure in spite of her conflict with her charming husband.  When Dustin Hoffman becomes a mere foil and a footnote as the play's producer, one clearly has an abundance of riches.    The cinematographer and set designer do a lovely job of marrying the fantasy and the reality: the film looks beautiful. Highlighted details like the early electric lightbulbs and the period automobiles underscore the changing of an age and the \\"toys-for-adults\\" aspect of nascent industrial technology. The costuming is also a visual treat.     Without being too overtly didactic, the movie both illustrates inspiration and inspires. If you aspire to be a writer, or just to reclaim a little innocence, this would be one to own on DVD when it comes out. But don't deny yourself the marvelous pleasure of seeing it now, and rooting for it to be remembered at Oscar time. Take Kleenex.
B000062TU1|4.0|this movie is great i have it i got it the first day it came out it was a wonderful movie so everyone that is a hp fan then buy this!
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I am not sure why this movie was panned so much by so-called critics.  Don't believe their whiny lies.  No, it is not \\"Citizen Kane\\", but it is vastly entertaining and does achieve what every movie's goals should be: suspension of disbelief, loss of time awareness (unlike \\"dogville\\", the most aptly named movie yet), riveting action sequences in superb settings, excellent acting (unlike any DMX movie), mixed with superior state-of-the art special effects.  Give this effort your time and attention.  You won't be disappointed, unless, of course, you're the type who likes mumbling, syrupy Jennifer Lopez dramas with George Clooney trying to be overly cute or dripping off-the-wall performances with equally out-to-lunch plots like \\"Entrapment\\".  This is a good movie.  See it for yourself and make up your own mind. Don't let some overpriced newspaper underling do it for you.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|ok this movie is soooooooo awesome! all the people that didnt watch it buy this or didnt read the books this movie is better then the first 2! oh i wanna get it the first day it comes out! people that didnt watch this movie but owns the first 2 buy this movie right away oh i cant wait till the forth one comes out yeha.
B0002I831S|5.0|I love the original Star Trek, and the first season contains many of the best episodes, like Devil in the Dark, City on the Edge of Forever, and Space Seed.  You'll smile at William Shatner's overacting, and snicker at the thought of toggle switches in space, but you will have a good time, and the DVD extras are fun.  <br /> <br />Star Trek The Original Series is a classic for a reason, and will be enjoyed by all science fiction fans.  It's well worth owning.  <br /> <br />The packaging, however, is a problem.  Removing a DVD to watch it is a four step process, and the \\"collectable\\" packaging just begs to be damaged.  It is slightly less ugly than the Voyager packaging, however.  Attention, Paramount:  Cheap plastic shatters in the mail, or even sitting innocently on the shelf if there's a slight breeze.  Use cardboard.  For good packaging, see Andromeda, Firefly, Stargate SG-1, and even Roswell.  All of these are well packaged.  Geez, even the X-Files packaging is better than this -- it's a pain in the, but at least it isn't ugly.
B00004WIDQ|3.0|i like this one still but i only give it 3 stars because it just doesnt get me super interested it doesnt have much thrill in it but its still a good movie i compared it with the 2nd i think the second is better but still its a great movie if you bought the second but didnt get the first you still have to get this one because you wont know what happened in the first one. but still if you think im saying its a bad movie really i think its still a good movie so you all that dont have this should buy it.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|Great movie if you are a single male, in your 50s, and own a boat.  Otherwise, paint drying is more exciting.  Dull, dull, dull.   <br /> <br />I think the Patrick O'Brian's estate should sue.  His books are lively, humourous, exciting and, well, had a story. Not this movie.  <br /> <br />\\"No women allowed\\" should be on the cover of this DVD.  My girlfriend was so bored that I am condemned to three \\"chick flicks\\" for picking this stinker.  Thanks Master and Commander.
B00004WIDR|4.0|i like this series alot its very good i think its alot better then the first longer and it reminds me of god zilla especially at the end when the big t-rex came and you see all the ppl running and ASIANS anyways once again they go to the island isla sorna i think i get confused somtimes but they study the animals again this is a big thriller very good movie but not the best because i see alot better movies but its still very good to watch oh and i know that the forth i think will be out next year oh i cant wait for that one.
B00001U0DP|5.0|\\"Life Is Beautiful\\" is the tragic and poignant tale of Guido, an Italian Jew in a concentration camp with his small son. Guido creates a story to explain the horrors of the war and the camp by telling his son that the entire thing is a game to win a tank. His sacrifice is immense and Bengini acted superbly in this magnificent tale. The dubbed version and the subtitled version are both intense and amazing. Recommendations all around. The original Italian-language film won Oscars - for a reason. Absolutely wonderful and haunting. The images of war and the starvation and horrors of the Holocaust are not as severe as in \\"Schindler's List\\", for instance, but the film itself is brilliant.
B00005JMCW|5.0|i loved this movie it was so funny its about anna and her mom suddenly switched bodies from a fortune cookie. its a awesome movie i prefer this movie then confessions of a teenage drama quenn the other movie that linzay played in. its a wonderful movie for the whole family.
B000683VI4|5.0|Yes.  First, let me say that I am a romantic and The Notebook is my absolute favorite book.  You really have to be willing to believe in love to enjoy this movie and not think it is too sappy. <br /> <br />Other Nicholas Sparks books that were made into movies (A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle) disappointed me.  I enjoyed the books when I read them but I thought the movies were too sappy and tried to hard to be tear jerkers.  I was so afraid that this movie would ruin the book for me. <br /> <br />Instead, I thought it was wonderful.  The script captured the book but also added enough changes to keep me surprised.  The actors finally put faces to the characters that I loved instead of making me think \\"No, he's definitely not a Noah.\\"  The actors did a wonderful job of bringing you into the story. <br /> <br />I went to see this movie with a bunch of friends.  We all left the theater choking back tears and comparing our romances to the one on the screen.  It gave me hope that my new husband and I will have an everlasting love like that. <br /> <br />If you see the movie and enjoy it, definitely read the book.  I also suggest reading The Wedding.  It's a \\"sequel\\" to The Notebook written from the perspective of one of Noah's son-in-law taking place about 5 years after where The Notebook leaves you.
B00003CX7L|5.0|How the makers of Toy Story could take our favorite characters, create a different storyline, add new characters, and turn it into a sequel this good is beyond me.  Usually changes such as the ones that were made in this movie end up being too different for my liking, but for some reason the changes only made the story of Woody, Buzz, and their pals more interesting.  The new characters (Jessie, Bulls-Eye, and Mrs. Potato Head.) fit right in with the old characters.      I think that many people will be pleased that Ham, Slink, Mr. Potato Head, and Rex all have bigger roles in this movie.  As a matter of fact, they are one of the main focuses.      I also must ask other people who have seen this movie if they recognized the man who sewed Woody's arm from the short story in \\"A Bug's Life\\".  What a funny little old man.    Overall, I would say that this is a great movie to watch as a family, especially if you've seen the original Toy Story.  I believe that not only is it cute, but it has a good message.  One of the best sequels I've ever seen!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|I love watching DVDs so much. I especially like the foreign language tracks too. What's great about this DVD is that it has four spoken languages - English (all of Region 1), French (Quebec, Canada), Spanish (Puerto Rico, Texas), and guess what the fourth language is? Mandarin! No, I'm not making this up! You can now watch Mulan the way it was intended to be - in Mandarin! Well, now us American DVD fans can watch Beauty and the Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame in French, The Three Cabarellos (did I misspell this?) and Saludos Amigos in Spanish, and now Mulan in Mandarin Chinese! What's next, Hercules with a Greek soundtrack? Aladdin with an Arabic soundtrack? How about The Lizzie McGuire Movie in Italian! Disney should make more DVDs with foreign languages of the settings in their movies! <br /> <br />BTW, this isn't just the only Region 1 Disney DVD with an uncommon language. The Winnie the Pooh Sing Along Songs DVD has English, Spanish, and Italian, the DVD storybooks have five languages (three include English, French and Spanish; I think the other two might be Italian and German), and some of the Japanese Anime movies distributed by Buena Vista (not Disney) have the original Japanese audio as well as English dubs. And maybe some movies from the Adult divisions of Buena Vista may have special foreign language tracks, too. <br /> <br />DVD foreign language fanatics, enjoy!
6303314015|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies ever made by Disney!  It contains love, friendship, action, adventure, and even a little bit of comedy.  The characters are entertaining, as well as being easy to relate to, and easy to love.  The story was charming and fun, and the artwork was bright and colorful.  The story had fairly exciting parts, simple parts, and sad parts.   <br /> <br />This movie was my absolute favorite when I was little, and is still a favorite of mine now.  I recommend it to parents looking for a good movie for their children, kids looking for a nice movie to watch, and anyone wanting to see what kind of movies Disney used to make.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Trey Parker and Matt Stone continue to be the funniest people in Hollywood. This movie was absolutely hilarious. Not only was the dialogue classic, but the soundtrack by Trey Parker was absolutely hysterical. I laughed for about 2 minutes straight after \\"America, F*ck yeah\\". The marionettes jerked and moved awkwardly, but I think Trey and Matt did this on purpose, and it made it that much funnier. They've mentioned many times that they loathed working with puppets, and you can tell they took the easy way out many times. I'm all for that, though, it makes it funnier. Someone was wondering why Pres. Bush wasn't in the movie at all. WAKE UP, MAN. They didn't need Bush. He was completely represented by Team America. Anyway, hilarious movie, hilarious soundtrack.  <br />
078681859X|3.0|After reading the Harry Potter series, it is hard to write fair comparisons in reviews of books in this genre.  Rowling is a master storyteller.  After reading the Amulet of Samarakand, it is obvious that Stroud is not.  However, it's not a bad book....just a bit above average, but well below the quality of Potter. <br /> <br />As the negative reviewers have pointed out, there is a complete lack of characterization.  I too felt that the main character was a stranger.  I did enjoy Bartimaeus, but the book overall lacks that spark I am constantly searching for in between Potter books.  <br /> <br />It's worth a read, if you get into it with the right expectations. Don't expect to be blown away, but you probably won't be disappointed, either.
B00004TRD8|5.0|There have been VHS, Limited Edition LD, VCD, and then the regular DVD for this movie.  But finally, this is the best release ever, period.  And yes, this older edition is even better than the Extreme Edition that was released later to assist the promotion of T3. <br />Only on this edition could you enjoy the most of everything related to T2.  Not only do you get the extended edition of the movie, but also the special extended edition that put a real end to the Terminator story line.  (They didn't show this edition for obvious reason.  Otherwise, there shouldn't be a T3.) <br />You also get hours and hours of seemed endless extra behind the scene materials. <br />The metal cover packaging is best fit this film. <br />It's harder to find this edition now, but if you do come across anyone of these, don't let it slip away from your fingers.
0312955006|5.0|After being initiated into Michael Connolly's novels with The Poet (5 stars), I unfortunately started the Harry Bosch series with City of Bones and the Lost Light. Those two were great, but I realized I was missing part of the story. Since then I went back and read Black Echo and Black Ice and got a lot of background information that helps me see the whole picture of Bosch's existence. Those two were very good (4 stars if I were to rate them), but Connolly really reaches his stride in The Concrete Blonde. Bosch is a fascinating character whose triumphs I savor, but I sometimes wonder if I would especially like him real life. I know him, but feel he is holding something back and keeping me at arms length. What makes Bosch tick is a mystery in itself within the mysteries of the novels. This book finds him alternating between being a defendant in a wrongful death civil suit and hitting the trail of a newly-discovered serial killer related to the court case. I do not feel it adds anything to recite the plot in these reviews, but I can say that Connolly is a master at the twists and turns and fooled me again in this book. In the best sense of the phrase and my appreciation for his writing skill, Connolly is no doubt a \\"master manipulator.\\"
B000002KDO|5.0|Its clear listening to bands like Cathedral or Electric Wizard that they were heavily influenced by Black Sabbath.From beginning to end Master Of Reality has a heaviness that's missing from any other Sabbath album ever recorded.The low distortion,the trudging,plodding pace,all that's missing is the depressing lyrical content and we'd have a Candlemass album.All of the songs truly shine with a life of their own.From the opener Sweet Leaf to the closing and heaviest Sabbath song ever written Into the Void,this is a stellar album that in my opinion is arguably one of the best and  most underrated heavy metal albums in existence.My personal favorites here are Children of the Grave,Into the Void and the perfectly melancholy Solitude which one could view as the precursor to Volume 4's ballad Changes.Also check the album's second song for further proof that the members of Sabbath weren't satanists.This is by far my favorite Sabbath album and after a few dozen listens,it'll be yours too.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This could have been a 5* album. Exception: Michaell McDonald... how did he get on this? Norah Jones is terrific, had a little trouble identifying Dianna Krall. <br /> <br />But, still highly recommend.
B000063DI9|5.0|This CD is just as good as \\"Somewhere In Time\\" is, and \\"Somewhere In Time\\" is MAIDEN's best CD, so that's saying a lot for \\"7th Son of a 7th Son\\" CD here. <br /> <br />Anyways, yep, this MAIDEN's concept album. <br /> <br />8 songs = 1 big storyline. <br /> <br /> <br />1.  Moonchild -  The destiny of what will happen to the 7th Son.  The devil automatically comes to do away with the one that would bless and heal the World.  The Legend of the Moonchild is what that is based on.  Also, it is somewhat similar to the life of Jesus kind-of.  For example:  \\"This child was born to die!!!!!\\" <br /> <br />2.  Infinite Dreams - The 7th Son's parents have crazy nightmares and dreams about their son's life and the things that he will do. <br /> <br />3.  Can I Play with Madness? - The 7th Son's parents go to local prophet to get answers to the crazy dreams, but the prophet is no help to them, and only critizes them, and pronounces a doom on that family. <br /> <br />4.  The Evil that Men Do -  The 7th Son's parents plan on having a 7th Son. <br /> <br />5.  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son title song -  The 7th Son is born and is monitored by his family of how he will become.  The 7th Son has all kinds of healing and prophetic power to see into the future for good purposes to bring a blessing to mankind.  Similar to Jesus. <br /> <br />6.  The Prophecy -  The 7th Son is rejected, even though he saw that his hometown was going to be destroyed soon, but no one believed him or that he really was the 7th Son.  The town is destroyed, but the 7th Son tried to warn them, but no one listened, and no one believed him.  The towns people just thought that he was just an ordiary person, and not the 7th Son that was promised.  (Similar to Jesus in His hometown of Nazareth).   <br /> <br />7.  The Clairvoyant - The 7th Son is at the peak of his life.  He is using his powers constantly.  He could see the future of others, but he could not see his own outcome, or that his powers was robbing awayhis life and health. <br /> <br />8.  Only the Good Die Young -  The 7th Son dies, and he gives up on the people that he tried to once help, because they gave up on him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Musically, AWESOME guitar playing from Adrian/H and Davey on this CD.  Especially at the end of \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" title song. <br /> <br />Some of Bruce's best singing is on this CD too.  You can't hardly hear Nicko on the drums, because the drums are so perfectly blended in with the guitars that you don't even know it is there. <br /> <br />Steve Harris shows some of his best Bass guitar skills on this CD too. <br /> <br /> <br />So actually, you really can't go wrong with this CD.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This is not a classic Ray Charles record, but it is not meant to be. What it does have are several classic duets of classic tunes however. Most notable is the work with Norah Jones, Bonnie Raitt and Diana Krall. Not groundbreaking but very enjoyable.
B000063DI8|1.0|Don't waste your money on this CD. <br /> <br />MAIDEN has much better CDs than this. <br /> <br />There are just a handful of good songs (4 or 5 maybe) on here and that's it. <br /> <br />There are also a lot of boo-awful songs on here too. <br /> <br />I don't know what happened with the band's song writting skills after Adrian/H left the band right after \\"7th Son of a 7th Son\\" tour was over, but it definitely wasn't good. <br /> <br />From Epic Metal to Radio-Friendly Hard Rock. <br /> <br />Huge jump in music in about 2 or 3 years break between \\"7th Son\\" CD and this. <br /> <br />If you are expecting this CD to sound like \\"7th Son\\" or their earlier CDs, keep looking elsewhere, because this CD surely isn't it. <br /> <br />Try the \\"Fear of the Dark\\" CD (the CD right after this boo-awful CD) instead if your looking for a later CD from them that has more of their early music sound. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Tailgunner\\", \\"Holy Smoke\\", \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" title song, \\"Running Silent Running Deep\\", and \\"Mother Russia\\" are the only reasons why to get this CD for.  The rest of songs are not all that great. <br /> <br />This is definitely a MAIDEN CD to save for dead last, or if just feel like wasting money for no reason. <br />
B000002UDB|5.0|And I love all their albums.  This one is sadly overlooked by many, as is the movie.  I guess people don't get it; these are the same people that don't get Monty Python or Pink Floyd.  For the rest of us, this album shows the Beatles at their most progressive and, in my opinion, is better than the great but often over rated Sgt. Pepper.  There is not one track on this album I would leave off.  The only changes i would make are: <br />1.Put the songs in the order they appear in the movie. That would be: <br />Magical Myster Tour <br />The Fool On The Hill <br />Flying <br />I Am The Walrus <br />Blue Jay Way <br />Your Mother Should Know <br /> <br />2.At the end of \\"Your Mother SHould Know\\", throw in the reprise of \\"MMT\\" like they do at the end of the movie. <br /> <br />Other than that, this album is PERFECT!
B000063DHL|5.0|Best MAIDEN CD period.<br /><br />If you like classic MAIDEN, or if you want to hear some of the best music you have ever heard, then buy this CD now!!!!!<br /><br />You absolutely will not be disapointed at all.<br /><br />SCI-FI Heavy Hard Rock here.<br /><br />All the songs on this CD has a type of futuristic feel to it.  Almost like these songs happen in the far distant future, except for \\"Alexander the Great\\" that happened in way back in 334 B.C.<br /><br />By the way, the awesome CD cover was inspired by the movie \\"Blade Runner\\".  \\"Blade Runner\\" movie with Harrison Ford in it, makes a nice follow up to this CD.
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver, 1976, is one of the gems of American Film's second Golden Age.  Most of the directors that went modern after the flamboyant 60's, finally, took what they liked in European cinema and melded it to Yankee concerns. <br /> <br />Those concerns have to do with the aftermath of a bitterly divisive war.  Vietnam vet, Robert De Niro in an unbelievable portrayal, plays the mentally ill insomniac that stalks, a presidential campaign worker, Cybill Shephard.  De Niro doesn't seem to have social graces because on their first and only date, he takes her to a porn movie.  Then he stalks her and transfers anger towards the candidate.  He buys lots of guns.  Then we have 12 year old, prostitute, Jodie Foster taking Cybill's place as a reason-to-save society. <br /> <br />The score is a death dirge while De Niro drives the filthy 1970's streets of New York in his cab.  He has to wipe the back seat after each night's fares. The final Agamemnon scene with the pimps is unbelievably realistic, yet, when it is over, the audience is both repelled and elated.  One of the most interesting shots of mayhem I have ever seen.  I think its better than the end of The Wild Bunch.  I think today it is still the most gripping action scenes and set shots. <br /> <br />This is Martin Scorese's best work. <br />

068987474X|4.0|I read a good portion of this book in the bookstore the other day.  I had heard so much about it, and read reviews here.  Anyone who trashes this book, and says it takes us back to the 1950s, or its only good for comical relief, or written tongue in cheek, or its not to be taken seriously, etc., - they are either involved with a married man (a big No-No in this book) or they have convinced themselves that guys who are worth having won't mind girls calling them for dates, that guys are really complicated, and some guy they want is giving them a hard time and they don't want to hear what this book says. <br /> <br />This is a very no-nonsense book, plain and simple, about how guys really are and how to read them.  Its not hard.  Don't listen to what he says.  Watch what he does.  If what a guy says is different from what he does - believe his actions, not his words.  Its like what Mammy told Scarlett in \\"Gone With The Wind.\\"  \\"What a man says, and what he thinks are two different things.  And I haven't noticed Mr. Ashley asking for to marry you.\\" <br /> <br />Every young girl and single woman should read this book.  Do you want to get married?  Do you want to waste your time dating a guy who only comes back to you when he can't find anything better?  Do you want to date and marry a man who really cares about you, or do you want heartbreak, misery and uncertainty?  Its up to you.  You can rail against this book all you want, but it won't change the fact that it tells the truth. <br /> <br />I just want to add that I read a review here where the girl says just listen to your mother to get the simple advice in this book.  That is what is so sad.  So many girls are not getting good advice from their mothers or fathers.  They are not being led through the mine-field of youth by caring adults, so they wind up as young women without a clue.  This book will give you a \\"clue.\\" <br />
0812580346|2.0|The book starts out compellingly when a science experiment intended to recreate conditions present moments after the Big Bang (of course I didn't actually understand this) instead causes everybody on Earth to glimpse 21 years into the future for two minutes. This produces major physical, psychological and political repercussions on a global level. But the scientist who ran the experiment, Lloyd, only seems to feel a passing guilt for causing mass tragedy (death and destruction from accidents that took place when everyone lost consciousness; people suicidal over their futures). There's not a lot of introspection into his lack of guilt, or, conversely, any investigation into the god complex he would likely get sucked into. Instead, he's inordinately worried about whether or not he should marry his fiancee given that he saw himself with someone else in 20 years.<br /><br />Much of the rest of the book similarly focuses on the mundane concerns of the not-very-interesting protagonists and fringe players: Lloyd's partner Theo becomes obsessed with preventing his murder that's 21 years away -- while that's not mundane, it's not that interesting to anyone except Theo; another scientist is just happy to learn that in two decades he gets laid -- this doesn't bring comic relief to the story, and just undercuts any grander implications. Speaking of grander implications -- there aren't many. There's no true, visceral emotion to the book, and no sense that anybody has learned anything. And ~~~~~ SPOILER AHEAD ~~~~~ the fact that Lloyd actually wants to be immortal, floating in a robo-body above the Earth, watching it disintegrate, doomed to hover around the cosmos for eternity while just about everyone else has been dead for millions of years, sounds like an unthinkable horror rather than a euphoric fantasy.
0393035158|1.0|Harris assumes his Stanford Ph.D. lends him the ammo he needs to discredit the legitimacy of faith.  His reliance on rationalism launches his polemic with a faulty premise, one that has been discredited by intellectual giants more earnest and powerful than he.  Faith does present a paradoxical problem, but, at least where Christians are concerned, it is only an intellectual problem.  Because faith depends on acknowledging that we lack the capacity to ever explain existence, surrendering to the notion that faith is not something we come to but which comes to us (through the Holy Spirit, as we surmise through the unmitigated brilliance of St. Paul), one hopes that Harris will come to this pristine realization in time.  For now, he is a seeker lost in the wilderness of intellectualism and rationalism, creaky methods for divining truth.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray takes all those who enjoy his music to places that you cannot get there by yourself. I have not heard a better version of You Don't Know Me. It is worth the cost of the CD. This album has introduced me to a couple of artist that I probaly would have never heard without them singning with Ray. This has been a real benenfit of this CD even if it has cost me a little more money. The CD is just like Ray the more you hear the more you enjoy it. The music of Ray charles has made my life much more richer. Thanks for the gift Ray.
B000VS6QTK|5.0|One of the best ever, if not the #1 best rock concert dvd ever.  Opening with Thunderstruck, this concert rocks on all levels -- it's great to see the huge crowd, the lighting, the camerawork and Angus' guitar work.  The drummer gives the best rock drum performance I've seen from any drummer on any concert.<br />I'd bought the original dvd when it came out years ago, and the blu-ray one recently; it's well worth getting blu-ray as it's sharper and clearer than ever.<br /><br />I think Chris Slade is the best AC/DC drummer I've ever seen, he rocks on Donnington and I would've liked to seen him on this one too. Slade's work on Donnington is the best drumming I've seen on any concert dvd in history.<br /><br />This dvd rocks hard and it's one I've played dozens of times, it's great to watch on a big tv or projection system with sound turned Way up.  Rock on!<br /><br />-k
B000286RKW|5.0|Goofellas is an out and out mafia film. Without the touching moments of say, a certain Godfather. I read a reviewer saying to `cover your ears...this film is naughty', well what do you want from a mob film. One thing you won't get is pleasantries. Maybe I should make some things clear. This film is rated 18 for a good reason...there is plenty of swearing, blood spewing, face beating, balls kicking, and general gangster kick-ass stuff.<br /><br />The new 2 disc DVD is well worth the extra dollars, best of all you get digital sound and visual quality, and a commentary by Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />The plot, well not so much a plot as it is based on a true story, is about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) a small time gangster who builds reputation and, of course money. As he weaves through life more people get to know him, until he becomes one of the biggest gangsters in town, alongside his friends (DeNiro, Pesci). But, of course the `stardom' in his own right gets to him. Mostly in the form of drugs.<br /><br />Ray Liotta is very convincing as Hill. You get this feeling that he never quite understands who he is and who his friends are, or in fact what they all do for a living. He lives in a dream world, everything is at hand. Liotta is tough but you sense a weakness, a humanity, something his partners are missing. Especially Joe Pesci. For me, he made this film. He was absolutely hilarious as the short tempered, short in general mobster. Call him a d*khead and your dead, no questions asked. The best scene in the whole film is when all the guys are playing cards Paesi asks a young waiter for a drink, but he doesn't hear him. The young waiter argues he didn't hear him, then they start arguing. Pesci then wants him to dance, waving his gun at the boys feet, but, Pesci being Pesci, shoots his foot right off. Very funny.<br /><br />The film does a great job of portraying the close, but not too close relationships. As Hill says, the next shot could hold a smile on its face, meaning it could come from anyone, even your friends. It's dog eat dog. It's gritty, and damn right funny., meaning it could come from anyone, even your friends. It's dog eat dog. It's gritty, and damn right funny. <br />

B00000AF95|2.0|A year later after Lick it Up's release KISS returns but this time with a new guitarist who's name really isn't worth mentioning. Why is that, you ask? Well, this guy was only with KISS for about as long as the Album last's. Anyway, I only really like 3 songs from Animalize and they are:      \\"I've Had Enough (into the fire)\\" RULES! I love this song, Paul's vocals once again make this song. 5 stars.     \\"Burn Bitch Burn\\" My 10th favorite KISS song EVER! Gene RULES and the backing vocals do to. 5 stars.     \\"While the City Sleeps\\" I really like this song even though alot of people don't. I think Gene delivers on this one and it could've very well fit nicely on Creatures of the Night or Lick it Up IMO. 4 stars.     Buy \\"Animalize\\" for these tracks ONLY or if you're a KISS Fanatic like myself, you must complete your KISS collection.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I picked up this CD shortly after it came out in Spring 2004 and was almost immediately hooked. Franz Ferdinand is simply put one of the only good groups around these days. Their music is an incredible blend of punk, rock, and dance. Not only are their songs musically fantastic, but they are also instilled with an incredible energy that can really only come from artists who are connected to their work. I had a chance to see them live in June, and they were fantastic, really just seeming to love being there performing their music. It was awesome. As a side note, they were also quite nice, as during autograph signing afterwards they were pretty sociable and Nick McCarthy even complimented my friends and I on our dancing... <br /> <br />Anyways, a fantastic debut album from what I hope will be a strong presence in the near future.
B0000640VN|5.0|Being a Meg Ryan fan, this had to be a must-see, but I was pleasantly surprised with Hugh Jackman's input as well. They make a terrific duo, as well as Meg with Tom Hanks!  I enjoyed the mild fantasy along with the time changing past-present idea.  Along with Meg's charm, all this mixed together, gives the romantic-comedy lovers a sweet treat.
B00005V1B1|4.0|Realistically I had forgotten all about this album and band over the years although they were one of my favourites during the 70's. A week or so ago I heard White Rider on XM radio (channel 51) and the memories came flooding back, ordered the cd from Amazon and have been playing it ever since. A great album from one of the all time great bands of the era, I actually owned this and Snowgoose on vinyl when they first came out and was fortunate enough to see the band at one of the mid-seventies Reading festivals. This is a must have for any fan of seventies British prog-rock.
1563899426|4.0|Vertigo is known for it's weird and often disturbing books.  Fables extablishes itslef as being part of this fine tradition, taking something that we all know and love and putting a new, unique, and above all, intelligent spin on it. <br />Fables revolves around a neighborhood in New York, where a large group of fairie tale characters are in hiding from a entity knwn only as the Adversary. The story is centered on a murder, being investigated by the no nonsense Deputy Mayor of Fabletown, Snow White, and the Sherriff, Bigby Wolf (Big Bad Wolf. Get it?).  To tell any more is to betray the story, but this is one of the most fun reads, and one of the cleverest stories ever created by Vertigo.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Mulan is one of the finest Disney movies ever produced. I have yet to disagree with Disney on any of their choices for \\"Platinum\\" or \\"Special Edition\\" releases.  The first thing I would like to address is the aspect ratio. A past reviewer claimed that \\"this is obviously not the original aspect ratio for this film!\\". That statement is utterly false. The previous release of Mulan on DVD had CROPPED wide-screen. This means that the picture was re-formatted so that it would appear to be in the 1:85:1 ratio, which trimmed off the edges of the picture as well as some of the top and bottom. True wide-screen always gives you MORE picture. It's extremely important to know the bars on the top and bottom are UNUSED space. Also,the original DVD release was NOT compatible with wide-screen televisions. I have viewed this disc up-scaled on a 50 inch HDTV and it looks glorious!  Now, for the first time, Mulan is presented in it's ORIGINAL aspect ratio of 1:66:1. This is the ratio for other films like Aladdin and The Lion King. The wide-screen is entirely anamorphic so wide-screen TV owners can rejoice at not having to stretch out the picture or have unnecessary black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. The picture quality/resolution is quite pleasing on an HD Display as I said above. Clear, bright, vivid colors show through on a spotless transfer of the film taken directly from the original CAPS files in the Disney vault.  The bonus features are very good. A wealth of material is presented on both Disc 1 and 2, making this truly worthy of the title \\"Special Edition\\". The features themselves are covered in other reviews, so I won't go into that. Just let me say that this is definitely a DVD release that no Disney or Mulan fan should pass up.  Mulan: \\"Can you stay for dinner?\\"  Grandmother: \\"Can he stay FOREVER?\\"
0780622553|5.0|Masterpiece Science Fiction whose incredible inspirationalism and spirituality make it also a Drama in esscence if not in definition, and whose darkness and terrifying concepts make it also a Horror movie in esscence if not in definition.  Set in a massive metropolis of eternal night where everyone seems blocked from noticing the strangeness of the abscence of the Sun, and whose architecture, culture, etc. seems to be composed from multiple human eras and locales; where shadowy entities can shut you down at midnight, erase your memories, and program you with a new life.  To say anything more than what is apparant in the opening minutes simply would not be right, except to say that the 'soul vs. brain' arguement does come into play.  Out-of-this-world conceptual design, and great performances by all, including Kiefer Sutherland, Rufus Sewell and William Hurt to name but three, but it's Jennifer Connelly who, as so often, steals the show performance-wise, vulnerable but utterly radiating her usual air of class, sensuality, intellect, beauty, and 'niceness'.  One of the most essential Science Fiction movies, an all-time great of storytelling and film-making.
B000641Z90|5.0|This DVD is being released on November 1, 2004 so the wait is not much longer. I went to 6 shows on this tour and if the performance is as good as the shows I saw we are all in for a treat. I anticipate this will be Phil's greatest live DVD. It can be played in PCM, Dolby, and DTS. The video and audio quality is reportedly superb and the disc offers additional footage from over the years totaling 8 hours of enjoyment. I just hope this isn't the last tour and live DVD released! <br />
B0002SROT0|5.0|Some may disagree over what their favorite song on this album is, or what works or doesn't work. But everyone who loves Elliott Smith's music seems to love whatever it was that touched them most, and if you have ever been touched by his work, it's all here... this one's a no-brainer. <br /> <br />As it happens, I just read a review that said that King's Crossing doesn't work, but on first listening, it jumped out at me as the best song on the album. <br /> <br />I now agree with that reviewer that Pretty (Ugly Before) is probably the strongest overall, but I hope he'll listen to King's Crossing again with Queen in mind, as I think that's part of Elliott's joke, and try to think of this as Bohemian Rhapsody for the 21st century. <br /> <br />Oh, yeah, and buy this disc right now.
B00000JLWW|5.0|if u get beyond the love story youll remember this is the story of a realship and real people died it was the grandest of all ships thus it needed its story told in such a grand way this movies music costumes effects are simply breathtaking its very sad and has the classic story of poorboy meets rich girl and it has a beautiful ending it deserved an oscar and is a very important film as for the real titanic not long after the movies release it started to decay and go away almost like the souls can rest now cause we realize those were real people with loves and lives who died i cried for them when i saw this film not for the love story
B0000584V3|5.0|This cd is nothing short of excellent.  This is the very first Opeth cd i bought and was money very well spent.  Opeth is in a whole different league of their own.  No one is like them at all, which really makes me like them more.  Better than the crap that has been released lately.  It's funny that people bash these guys, but recommend bands like good charlotte and grade 8 like in one review i read.  Please do me a favor, NEVER review another cd again because you obviously don't know music or watch mtv waaaaaaaaaay too much.  Don't even compare Opeth to that \\"mainstream\\" crap.  They are much more talented than that crap could ever even think about being.  With that being said definately pick this cd up.  It is an experience like no other.  There isn't a song on this disc that is nothing short of brillance.  If you like them i highly recommend the rest of their cds.  Damnation is their slower, less brutal cd, but definately delivers the goods too just in a different way.  Even if it takes a few spins to get into them I guarantee you will get addicted to them like i have and some of the other reviewers here too.
B000001FA4|5.0|This is my favorite of all of U2's releases, with Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree very close behind.  The CD is one of those rare CDs that you can't stand to listen to just one song or two; you have to listen from beginning to end.  U2 had really found their sound with this release and it's done with perfection.  The release starts out with \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" - one of my all-time favorite U2 songs.  It's catchy and very fun to sing along with, but not catchy in the commercial sense.  \\"Pride\\" is a great rocker that most people know and enjoy. \\"Bad\\" is another one of my all-time favorite U2 songs - incredibly deep lyrics and Bono's interpretation gives the song a sense of awe.  \\"MLK\\" is a very powerful, but short song that, like \\"Love is Blindness\\" - on Achtung Baby, I love to listen to the song in complete darkness.  Try it sometime with both songs, you'll be amazed at the power of both of these songs in the dark without day-to-day distractions.  I can't recommend this CD enough - it is a thrill from start to finish.  I played this release a lot in the 80's and here in the new millenium, I still play it a lot.  Many CDs can't stand the test of time, but this one sure does.
0916990427|5.0|Not only is this book my favorite book on Time-Lines, but I consider Time-Lines the most valuable NLP process.  Time Line techniques have helped me to create virtual healing miracles, by going back to the past before the problematic situation began and going through the time-line to the present and future, as if the problem never existed.  Health problems which were diagnosed as terminal and without hope for recovery - were gone in only few days of working with Time-Lines.<br /><br />It will be well-worth your time to learn how to work with time-lines whether you desire to use them for your own benefit or to assist others, if you are a therapist.<br /><br />This book will thoroughly guide you through Time Line Patterns and Processes, and many different adventures you can have with time-lines - whether you desire to resolve emotional issues from the past, accelerate learning of new skills, re-create your life (or if you prefer the programming which is impressed upon your subconscious mind / neurology), accelerate spiritual growth (I have had some out of this world spiritual experiences thanks to working with Time-Lines).<br /><br />You'll also learn how to work with logical levels, use advanced Time-Line Patterns, how to use linguistic time-lining and much more - you'll have extra fun when you learn to use time-lines through conversation.<br /><br />Get this book - you'll be grateful you did!
B0000648WZ|4.0|First of all, if you have read the brilliant Hugo Award-winning novel by Robert A. Heinlein and you're going to watch the movie realize the two aren't even in the same ballpark. Heinlein's classic is a thought-provoking commentary about what we all take for granted and, like all great works of sci-fi and fantasy, it can be read on many levels.     Now, Paul Verhoven's movie is two hours of pure, unadultered, and utterly shameless B-movie shlock. It's not without it's moments of satire, but it's clear the only kind of debate Verhoven wanted to spark was which battle scene was cooler.    If you take the movie strictly on this level you're in for a heck of a time. Yes, there's plenty of cheesy lines. And yes, the acting is straight from a bad daytime melodrama (and for that matter, so is the casting). That being said, the movie is well-paced, action-packed, and full of cool special effects (and big, exploding, spiders).     The bottom line is that this flick is not exactly what I'd call cerebral, but it is a lot of fun!
B00005JL0I|1.0|This movie is not bad. That would be good. Is awful. It sucks. It stinks to heaven. The world has never experienced such a dog since Attila the Hun. <br /> <br />No plot. No story. Lots and lots a talented people wasted. Peter Sellers, why you? And Orson Welles? Gimme a break! Beautiful Ursula. Well, perhaps the only thing worth watching there. Et tu, Woody Allen? Maybe he needed the money. Who knows? And the impossible end. Oh, Lord, they even throw in the U.S. Cavalry. But no, if you still want to watch this disaster, do it at your own risk. It may kill you, really: it's that bad.
068987474X|5.0|This book is a funny but, real look at what a man is really doing and thinking when he comes up with his LAME excuses that we buy into. It will help you understand when a man \\"just isn't into you\\" and quit making excuses for him and yourself for allowing his actions. It is freeing and shows women that the power is yours to put up with it, after all if you know what to expect you know how to react. It teaches women to hold every man to your stantard and to not settle for \\"crumbs\\". You are worth it so, as Greg says \\"Don't waste the pretty\\" Move on to someone who will rock your world and is worth the great gift of YOU!!
0060922583|5.0|The book not only provides a perspective of looking at the universe as holographic, but also provides an avalanche of very interesting stories.<br /><br />As a Clinical Hypnotherapist, and a firm believer that there are no limitations to what we can experience and the changes we can create in our bodies and in our lives, even on genetic level, I wanted to share one of the stories from this book:<br /><br />\\"Brocq's disease involves a horribly disfiguring hereditary condition. Victims of Brocq's disease develop a thick, horny covering over their skin that resembles the scales of a reptile. The skin can become so hardened and rigid that even the slightest movement will cause it to crack and bleed.<br /><br />Brocq's disease was incurable until 1951 when a sixteen-year-old boy with an advanced case of the affliction was referred as a last resort to a hypnotherapist named A.A. Mason at the Queen Victoria Hospital in London. Mason discovered that the boy was a good hypnotic subject and could easily be put into a deep state of trance.<br /><br />While the boy was in trance, Mason told him that his Brocq's disease was healing and would soon be gone. Five days later the scaly layer covering the boy's left arm fell off, revealing soft, healthy flesh beneath. By the end of tend days the arm was completely normal.<br /><br />Mason and the boy continued to work on different body areas until all of the scaly skin was gone. The boy remained symptom-free for at least five years, at which point Mason lost touch with him.<br /><br />This is extraordinary because Brocq's disease is a genetic condition, and getting rid of it involves more than just controlling autonomic processes such as blood flow patterns and various cells of the immune system. It means tapping into the masterplan, the DNA programming itself. So, it would appear that when we access the right strata of our beliefs, our minds can override even our genetic makeup.\\"
B0002OERI0|5.0|If you're read other reviews you already know that this CD is different from the rest (for the most part).  I think this is a great CD.  This is the first time they have songs that are longer than 3 minutes, Jesus of Suburbia being being just over 9 minutes long.  That is a great song, by the way, which not too many people seem to comment on.  It has a sort of Bohemian Rhapsody feel to it.  Don't get me wrong, it sounds nothing like Queen, but the way they they switch style throughout the song is really cool.  Overall its a great CD, besides American Idiot (its already been overplayed).
068987474X|1.0|Before you buy this book, please do the following;<BR>1. Read the 1-Star review on amazon.com<BR>2. Ask a male friend to flip through some pages for feedback<BR>3. Remind yourself that the 2 authors are neither relationship experts nor educated in related field - they are indeed 2 script writers for a cable TV show<BR>4. Check to see if you still have a brain<br />This book is such a waste of time (and money). If anyone believes what Greg says, they deserve to have problems finding the right guys. Everything in the book is generalization. According to Greg:<BR>1. Women shouldn't make any moves. Just sit there and wait. Guys should do all the work<BR>2. Be as paranoid as possible <BR>3. Human behaviour is always pre-determined and formularized<BR>4. If you miss and love someone, you will want to call them everyday, even 4 times a day, like he does (I will just put this type of behaviour under the &quot;loser&quot; group where Greg probably belongs)<br />The biggest joke is Greg's unofficial survey. He emailed 20 of his friends, asked some random questions and drew a bunch of useless conclusions. Greg, we don't care what your friends think. Take a course in research and analysis before charging people $30 for a piece of trash (with fonts bigger than a bed-time story book).  Here is my research: my friends (male or female) who had read this book thought that this is an insult to the publishing industry.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|Why so shocking? Well every year Nick keeps releasing material. You would have thought that the albums would have a couple of good songs and filled with well filler!  <br /> <br />Not so... <br /> <br />Of the recent albums since Let Love In, I thought No More Shall We Part was a masterpiece, but this probably just beats it. Certainly with the exclusion of The Brown Ape Song and the Lyre Of Orpheus, the album is flawless. <br /> <br />Nature Boy whilst catchy and strong, does not even compare to the upcoming single \\"There She Goes My Beautiful World\\" which is one of the funkiest and hard hitting songs I have ever heard from Nick. <br /> <br />Some of the songs on Lyre of Orpheus are just \\"good\\" as opposed to brilliant, and if I could only take one album it would be Abbatoir Blues. <br /> <br />Fortunately you get two great albums. How they can better this I am not sure, but I look forward to finding out. Why Nick is not more popular as his talents in my opinion equal or surpass Coldplay is uncertain but I suppose his music does not have mass appeal. Which is a shame, as noone wants to ever go to the concerts with me! Oh well I will go alone, this album is amazing, and I recommend it highly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006J3WH|2.0|I've really loved the episode of \\"Once More, with Feeling\\", but can't say the same about the soundtrack. You just can't make professional singers out of actors. Even though some of the voices are good, they are mostly untrained. <br />\\"Going Through the Motions\\" has a stupid cut. Before the actual song starts, which is approximately (only) 1:30 min. long, a prelude is played - in the series, it does fit. The prelude is some nice backgroundmusic for the beginning, but neither for the song Buffy sings afterwards nor for a CD. Also there are some nice scenes, that make the song funny - but this gets lost here, and as an additional, the song becomes boring. Sarah Gellar's voice is just too thin and not variable enough, though I think her voice is nice. <br />\\"I've Got a Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together\\" <br />It's just nice to look at this scene. The \\"I've Got a Theory\\"-part is okay, you can listen to it during the episode, for example because of Xander's verse about the witches and the reaction of Tara, and his drawback, but face it: He can't sing. Nor can Alyson Hannigan, though her voice is \\"cute\\" - it is too unprofessional, she can't really handle it. <br />The \\"Bunny\\"-part is just FUN - the scene especially, Emma Caulfields performance and the effects, but not the song. Would you EVER find something like that on a CD, if it wasn't from Buffy or another series? 'Doubt it, really. <br />Well, the \\"If We're Together\\"-part... It was nice. I liked it. I liked the lyric (if you know the series), the collective singing and Sarah's voice. <br />\\"The Mustard\\" <br />Loss of words, I guess. (God, I didn't even like this little 10 seconds scene, as it was showed at the original.) <br />\\"Under Your Spell\\" <br />Well, Amber Benson's voice is just great, but the song is kind of weak. It's kind of monotonous, if you listen to it more often, even though Amber's voice really catches the right emotions, it doesn't least for more than two times. <br />\\"I'll Never Tell\\" <br />I wouldn't say, that this song is serious, it was a nice scene in the episode, but already at the second time I skipped it. This song isn't enough to just listen to it, the lyric is funny one time and then you just skip it. <br />\\"The Parking Ticket\\" <br />Even though this song is absolutely short, not serious and only thrown into the scene, I liked it, because Marti Noxon's voice is better, than 75% of the others. <br />\\"Rest in Peace\\" <br />The song wasn't bad, but I think James Marsters wanted to sing more powerful and wasn't able to, so that the atmosphere and the emotions couldn't really be expressed. His voice just isn't elaborated, and really could get better. (Heck, the scene is really melodramatic.) <br />\\"Dawn's Lament/Ballet\\" <br />I guess Michelle Trachtenberg can sing, but these two \\"songs\\" doesn't prove anything. One is a few seconds long, another one with - ahm - no singing? (And also not really longer) <br />\\"What You Feel\\" <br />I liked the dancing of the demon, I liked the scene, was kind of entertaining - how it probably should be. But the song alone is just inexpressive, and because of this: boring. <br />\\"Standing\\" <br />I really enjoyed the song, and the scene. I like it, and I also like Anthony Head's voice. He maybe can't keep a note up for long, but his voice does not sound that untrained and the melody for this song is really neat. <br />\\"Under Your Spell/Standing (Reprise)\\" <br />Well, great idea. I think Joss Whedon realized, that his two best singers are Amber Benson and Anthony Stewart Head. MAYBE he shouldn't do such a reprise, but let them perform another song together, but no matter: This song is great. The overlap of the lyrics and the voices are really good, this was the scene/song I liked most. <br />\\"Walk Through the Fire\\" <br />The melody was good, the song in general also, but a few things were a bit disturbing. I think the idea with Anthony Head doubting if his decision was right and Brendon and Caulfield joining him, and afterwards everyone singing besides Mrs. Gellar wasn't really right. It kind of destroyed the harmony of the song, robbed the melancholy and made it to a \\"WE ARE HEROES\\"-song. Wrong idea, really. <br />\\"Something to Sing About\\" <br />The first part until Buffy/Sarah Michelle Gellar began with her \\"Something to Sing About\\"-stuff was nice, then it became a - well - kind of bothering song, but once again the song was changed, and I liked it again, the last part, where James Marsters is singing wasn't that good [and the dancing scene neither], so all in all the song had potencial to be very good, but was kind of destroyed by some badly chosen parts. <br />\\"Where Do We Go From Here?\\" <br />\\"Spike\\" said this really right: \\"Kumbayayas\\" This song is just so... usual. So... stereotype. It's nothing really new, only watching it was okay, but listening to it as a song is nothing great. The song isn't bad, but also weak. <br />--- <br />All in all Whedon's work wasn't good. As an episode it was really great, it was fun, but it's no professional work, it's not worth buying. If you wanted to: Buy the DVD. It's really better. <br />Whedon made too many mistakes, for example with \\"Walk through the Gire\\" and the singers really aren't great also, it was all kind of amateur-like, but if you look at the fact, that it was made by amateurs in this point, it was really good work. It WAS no professional production, and that's what I've said, that's the reason, why the CD isn't worth buying (And as said by someone else: The mix really isn't good), but the series, and the episode - it's fun. I don't say that it's all bad and terrible, it was good work - but don't feel like \\"Oh, I'm a Buffy-fan, the episode was great, the CD is a must-have now!\\".
B00008H2LE|5.0|The title says it all! All the songs are huge hits and Hybrid Theory was just as good. Will they ever make a bad song? Doesn't seem like it. Almost all the songs on this CD have been on the radio at least once. Linkin Park has done an amazing job so far. Keep making awesome music!

0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's timeless classic about a man in a racially divided town in 1932 trying to raise his two children while preparing his defense of a black man wrongly accused of rape was turned into the motion picture of the same name that won Gregory Peck (who immortalized the role of Atticus Finch, the lawyer/father) the Oscar for Best Actor in 1962. This book accurately explores the racial issues that were rampant at the time that the novel was set and that the book was written in 1960. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and Universal Pictures adapted it into the movie we all know and love the following year. Harper Lee herself gave the movie the go-ahead and was well-pleased when it was released in December, 1962. Though this is more a review about the movie, I relate better to the film because it condensed the novel very effectively. Not since \\"Gone With The Wind\\" (also turned into a classic motion picture in 1939, winning 10 well-earned Oscars) and \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" (I don't know of any existing film version, but if somebody does think of it, for the love of God, do it well), has a novel come out of the South and recieved world-wide acclaim. The book is rated PG for thematic elements and some racial dialogue, including some language. The film is Not Rated.
1400032717|5.0|<br /> <br />The story begins in the middle of the night when Christopher notices, across the road, that Mrs Shears' dog Wellington has been killed with a garden fork. He goes into that garden and takes a closer look. But it is little sooner before Mrs Shears is up and screaming at what has happened. The police are called, and Christopher is questioned, but it is little sooner than Christopher himself gets into trouble.  <br /> <br />Having eventually been let out of the police station, Christoper sets off to investigate the case of the dead dog. But his father is continually telling him off, ordering him to stay out of other people's business. Personally, I'd be on Christopher's side, partly since what he is doing is constructive. Things continue in many ways. But I can't say much more without giving too much away. Just like your typical mystery novel (not that I tend to read novels of any sort), this is a book of suspense. You have to experience it for yourself.  <br /> <br /> <br />More about the content:  <br /> <br />Christopher shows many traits typical of someone with AS. These include his difficulty in understanding people and an eye for detail, both of which manifest in the descriptions throughout the book. As the story unfolds, we learn more about Christopher, including his unusual superstition and his knowledge of maths and science, which he shows off in some of the many diversions from the main plot.  <br /> <br />How realistic it is on the whole, it's hard to tell. I suppose I see bits of myself in Christopher, though there are ways in which he is different, including a level of bravery I certainly wouldn't have had when I was 15. (Another surprising difference is that he doesn't seem to know better about the various bogus London phone numbers that he comes across.) But one difference from reality I seem to have noticed is that the extent to which people swear (and I'm talking about adults here) is rather exaggerated. Maybe I'm just not used to being in quite such a dirty-mouthed neighbourhood. Maybe Christopher's sensitivity and the circumstances are distorting things a bit. But you MUST read this book! It is really special. <br /> <br />Another Amazon quick-pick I highly recommend is THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez, which really made me laugh.  <br />
068987474X|4.0|Ladies, read it and then stop making excuses for \\"your man.\\"  It's a cut-to-the-chase book that will have you evaluating your relationship.  Bottom line is you deserve to be with someone who is as into you as you are into them.  Do not settle for less.  He either wants you or he doesn't.  I think some women need it all spelled out for them as in this book.  Some reviewers pick on the examples, but I didn't find any of them too hard to believe.  We keep hoping the guy will realize this or that and waste our time with him in the process.  And if you were the pursuer in the relationship, chances are he isn't and won't be that into you.  A bit old fashioned, but the women with whom I've discussed this agree-none of the relationships we started lasted.  We have all experienced at least one (but likely more) of the chapter titles at some point.  Not surprised to see some negative reviews here by men because their stories have been exposed, though some male reviewers are honest enough to admit to using these excuses.  I am passing my copy around to all single female acquaintances for education purposes!  My boyfriend of 3+ years read the book too and his review is:  although this book is targeted at budding romances, the advice also applies to established relationships (and in this case, to both men and women.)  Having said that, it's clear that as advice to women seeking new men in their lives, his words will help cut a path through the chaff and expose the undeserving for what they are. Do you think the author's investment portfolio is heavily weighted in the telecom and wireless sector?
6305882592|5.0|One of the most delightfully oddball comedies you'll ever see, \\"Harold and Maude\\" features Bud Cort (an eccentric young actor best known otherwise only as a Hollywood party guest) as eccentric young Harold, son of a remarkably self-absorbed and pretentious wealthy widow who sees her son in a notably dysfunctional way.  Harold responds by trying to shock her into showing some kind of sign that she cares about him at all, while the only such sign forthcoming is a hilarious scene with the mother filling out Harold's personality survey for a computer dating service by answering all the questions herself, Harold never uttering a word.  So much for one's individuality. <br /> <br />Enter Maude, played by Ruth Gordon (forever earning her a permanent and special place in the hearts of millions), the personification of the phrase \\"free spirit.\\"  She sees things quite differently from anyone else in the world, and in a delicious twist of irony Harold, who has been trying to shake up his mother, gets shaken up himself by this elderly hippie.  While some of the things that follow are clearly over the edge, Harold ultimately learns that one can be one's own self without being overly concerned of what others think, even his own overbearing mother.  Enter a happy ending that's as unconventional as anything else in this film. <br /> <br />There are moral issues a-plenty to deal with here.  A young man having an affair with a woman 60 years his senior, suicide, personal property issues, attitudes toward the military, etc.  These things had a quite different angle when this film was made in the early 1970s, so in some ways HaM is a bit dated.  But it's a very effective and very funny film that you just can't take your eyes off of.  Recommended for an adult audience, even for the more thoughtful of our younger generation, but mostly this is highly recommended to anyone who likes their entertainment to make them think and reexamine their view of the world.  A hearty sense of humor is arequirement as well.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that this movie looks really lame and I was dragged to the movie theater to see it.  But I was pleasantly surprised. It's extremely politically incorrect and hilariously funny.  Even if you're not a big South Park fan, this is a movie you will enjoy.  The characters are so funny.. I mean, who DOESN'T want to see a puppet of North Korean Dictator, Kim Jong Il, sing \\"I'm So Ronery\\"?  It's classic.  The political satire is excellent.  The point they're trying to get across is that actors should quit trying to use their clout to persuade the world into adopting their way of thinking, politically speaking. Just because you have tons of money and starred in last summer's box office hit, doesn't mean you know anything about politics.  I totally agree with the main theme of the movie and found the characters tremendously entertaining.  Anyone who finds this movie offensive must have forgotten that the foundation of our nation is that everyone has the legal right to speak against your government... Be it a protest.. Or a side-splitting comedy starring puppets..  Beware of the gratuitous puppet-sex scene.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I saw this movie twice last year at Christmas time.

0440211727|3.0|Street lawyer Jake Brigance is thrust into the national spotlight when he takes a case defending a black man who has murdered two white men for raping his twelve year old daughter. Brigance is the center of a legion of competing pressures and concerns, including escalating involvement in the case by the Mississippi population of blacks, and by the Ku Klux Klan. We get an intimate look at the legal process, as Jake fights off other lawyers seeking to represent his client, attempts to manipulate the press, the judge, the prosecution, and the jury, and faces problems dealing with practicing law on a tight budget. He walks a fine moral line as the situation escalates, and eventually finds himself hiding out at a friends house while the Klan tries to murder him.  <br />The Good and the Bad: <br />     After reading two or three other novels by this author (including The Firm), I've been talking down John Grisham for years, but this book has made me revise my opinion of him. A preface tells us that this is Grisham's most personal work, and his first; I think that those two factors may be what makes this book stand out to me.  <br />     This book has a lot going for it. The pacing is well-done, mixing violence and action scenes in with the also-exciting twists and turns in the legal arena. The book slowly builds to a natural climax with the jury decision, and the obstacles and situations Jake faces are varied and inventive. The language and writing are also very serviceable, with appropriate amounts of description and dialogue (although there seems to be a near-obsessive tendency to include detailed descriptions of every meal and drink consumed by the characters). This writing gives the author the air of a seasoned professional rather than the first-timer he was at the time.  <br />     The book also contains enough nuanced ethical considerations to be the focus of a college ethics course. Time and again, Jake is confronted with moral decisions, and his decisions are allover the place ethically. At times, I was impressed with his morality; often, I was shocked at his immorality. The other characters are also instruments of moral dilemmas, not the least of which is Carl Lee's murder of the two rapists.  <br />     Another great aspect of the book was the authority with which the legal profession is presented. As a lawyer, Grisham clearly knows the ins and outs of the profession, and his insider view of jury selection, expert psychiatric testimony, and the way that lawyers compete for a desirable case are all fascinating.  <br />     On the down side, I have two major criticisms, and they both cropped up so frequently that they inhibited my ability to lose myself in the story. I didn't like Grisham's other novels because I felt that the characters weren't flawed enough to make them interesting. Jake is flawed, all right, and his flaws make him kind of detestable. Detestable might be too strong of a word, but certainly, he was less than sympathetic in many ways. He hungers for media attention, putting it above his client's best interests. He threatens to sever a friendship with a court administrative aid if she doesn't give him a list of prospective jurors that the judge has ordered her not to give him. He flirts with his beautiful legal assistant, and keeps her existence a secret from his wife. In fact, he keeps a lot of secrets from his wife, including the fact that the Klan has burned down their house. He stands idly by while a sheriff literally breaks the legs of a Klan member, and then jokes about it the next day. He seems to use the word nigger interchangeably with black man, and states prejudiced views, such as \\"nigger are unpredictable, especially when they're in trouble.\\" I could go on, but you get the point. This is a main character that's hard to root for. The other characters are generally interesting, but sometimes cartoonish, especially the prosecutor, a fat political aspirant whose main function seems to be getting blustered at Jake's shot-from-the-hip one liners. <br />     That leads to my other criticism, which is that too often, Grisham turns to the camera and winks, asking us to chuckle or give an affirming cheer. Every time we see Brigance confront Buckley, the exchange ends in Jake getting the last word in, and it infuriating Buckley. Things like this, extending to several plot points, are just a little too pat.  <br />     Overall, an enjoyable novel that should help you burn some midnight oil. <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|the album stinks so bad. I'm a green day fan but. . . what happened? The other people that reviewed this album probably know the band and don't want to hurt their feelings. All they talk about is dying and commiting sucide (sue es side) Not sure if that's how you spell it. Anyway, I want the old green day back. I want the 'dookie' style green day. Some songs are good like 'she's a rebel' and 'whatsername.' 'american idiot' is good. And also 'holiday.' I prefer to get those singles. If you are a person that love listening to people saying that they want to commit sucide then be my guest. 'letterbomb' is ok too.

Both of my daughters (2 years old, and 4 months old) love Baby Nursery, and are completely enchanted by the mix of colorful gears, trains, cars, puppets and animations --- even more enchanted than by their other favorite DVDs, which I didn't think was possible!

B000001FA4|4.0|Here it is. The one that made U2 almost a household name. Before this one people referred to them as \\"those guys from Ireland that do New Year's Day.\\" 1983's \\"War\\" saw the end of U2's heavily distorted guitar-driven rock. This album introduced the fairlights; the Edge's more subdued sound crafting on guitar (with some exceptions, of course); Bono's burgeoning confidence and lyrics that delved more into the poetical and the political; more electronic sounds (courtesy of Brian Eno). This one probably confused and shocked fans of the first three U2 albums. This was a new direction. But in retrospect, this constant redefining of what the band is all about probably contributes greatly to their longevity. They aren't afraid to reinvent themselves. Some of the experiments have been more successful than others, but \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" stands up as one of U2's best risks.<br /><br />\\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" was U2's first real \\"hit\\" (though nothing compared to what would come a few years later). Some other minor hits followed (The title track, \\"A Sort of a Homecoming\\"). For the first time U2 fans heard their band on commercial radio. And MTV finally played them more often than once every New Year's (a tradition that continued for many years). The obvious concerns followed: \\"are they selling out?\\" If this is selling out, then bands need to sell out more often. Songs about Martin Luther King, Jr., anti-drug songs, a rare instrumental, and some lashing bass lines make this a wild ride. The beginning of the album starts out on a slower note, then explodes into \\"Pride\\". U2 fans at the time probably breathed a sigh of relief at \\"Pride's\\" opening guitar explosion. \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" sounds like nothing U2 had recorded up to that point. \\"Pride\\" stood in the tradition of U2's blaring guitar based rock (such as \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"Gloria\\", and \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\").<br /><br />Of course we all know what happened next. \\"The Joshua Tree\\" appeared in 1987, blew everyone away, and U2 became an institution. \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" paved the way, and tensions grew in the band about where to go next. The Edge apparently wanted another \\"Unforgettable Fire\\". That didn't happen. The band went big time. A repeat of this album likely wouldn't have taken them there. Maybe that's why three years passed between albums. We all know who they are now.ne away, and U2 became an institution. \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" paved the way, and tensions grew in the band about where to go next.

B000007RYQ|5.0|Yes, Mahlerites will shudder the first time they hear this.  I certainly did.  But the more I thought about it, and when I subsequently bought it and started listening to it with an openness to what Caine et al. are trying to do, I started to realize that true Mahlerites will see this as immensely insightful, and for much more than its novelty value.  And anyone capable of appreciating both Mahler and jazz will hear this disc as very relevant and enjoyable.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I like artists who take risks; ones who don't put out the same sound CD after CD because they don't want to alienate their core audience. I mean, on the book side, look at Anne Rice. One silly vampire novel after another. Whenshe attempts to write something else, her fans ignore it. So, while a lot of hardcore \\"punk\\" fans will dislike this latest effort, I say, so what. It's a well crafted piece of tuneage. I have enjoyed this whole CD from beginning to end, and feel there is no weak song on it. Is it a great rock opera in the vain of Tommy or The Wall? Surely not, but it's a noble effort, and not something done in this current world of forgetful songs and talentless singers who don't deserve the praise they get. Bitter? Maybe, but I am puzzled by the success of the Simpson girls. And the Now This Is What I Call Crappy Music Vol. 217. I digress. My hats off to Green Day, it's a worthy album to own and 100% better than REM's latest snoozes fest.
B000001IPL|5.0|Offspring's 1994 Smash was a success in many ways.  First off it owns the record for most sales by an album on an indie label.  Furthermore, this album paved the way for many great rock and punk bands to come.  Finally, it propelled The Offspring to the top of their musical genre along with other great bands such as Green Day. <br /> <br />Smash offers an entire cd of quality songs (none need be skipped) that will have the listener tapping thier foot as well as banging their head to the rhythm.  On this album, The Offspring display their ability to make extremely catchy tunes that go hand in hand with a rocking beat.  The pace is fast, the guitars are heavy, the vocals are amazing and the tempo of how the songs on the album are laid out makes for a great listen all the way through.  Dexter's voice is put to good use on all of the songs and he really displays what makes The Offspring better than a lot of other punk bands: Solid vocals. <br /> <br />This album contains classic Offspring releases such as \\"Come out and Play\\" \\"Self Esteem\\" \\"Gotta Get Away\\" and \\"Smash\\".  But don't let that lead you to beleive that the other songs are sub-par.  They're not! All 14 tracks are amazing. <br /> <br />So whether you like punk, pop punk, rock, hard rock, there is a good chance that this album will appeal to you.

B0000028VT|5.0|This album showcased Mariah at her best. It is my favorite album by her! The songs are solid and revolves around the language of love. All the tunes are written by Mariah except for Without You which is a remake. This is her best-selling album in the States! It went diamond and spawned the #1 hits Dreamlover and Hero. This is my take on the songs:    1. Dreamlover - Excellent first single. Produced by Dave Hall and MC herself. Very catchy. 8 weeks at #1. (5/5)  2. Hero - An inspiring ballad. Walter and Mariah worked their magic again and deliver this spectacular ballad. 4 weeks at #1. (5/5)  3. Anytime You Need A Friend - Haunting with a gospel-tinged sound. Very meaningful lyrics. This song is hard to sing live and when I saw her do it, amazing! She pulled it off. (5/5)  4. Music Box - Juz some tidbit, this is the only Mariah song that never used the title in the song. Very slow and nice.(4.5/5)  5. Now That I Know - Mariah brought back David Cole on this one. Its a nice change. Great beats! (5/5)  6. Never Forget You - Now this is my favorite song from this album. Produced by Babyface (you can hear his signature sound)  (5.5/5)!  7. Without You - A cover from an old hit, and Mariah made it her own. A classic! Vocally challenging, but you know Mariah; she  never disappoints. (5/5)  8. Just To Hold You Once Again - A sad song about unrequited love; loving someone she don't even know. (4.5/5)  9. I've Been Thinking About You - Another David Cole production; very edgy and fast-tempo. After those ballads that make you cry this will lift your spirits a bit. (4/5)  10.All I've Ever Wanted - My favorite; 2nd to Never Forget You. Listen to the lyrics! Mariah's songwriting skills are amazing!(5/5)  11.Everything Fades Away (bonus track) - A nice slow ballad to end the album; relaxing and soothing. (4.5/5)    If you haven't got this than what are you waiting for? This is   Mariah's best and if you're looking for a ballad-heavy album, this is for you. Her vocals are off-the-hook! Beautiful album accompanied by a beautiful voice. Mariah and Walter are truly a music match made in heaven.

B00005JMYI|4.0|I loved this movie.  It is a rare ocassion to go to a theater and laugh so hard it hurts!!  I was laughing out loud.. tears in my eyes.. just cracking up at this movie.  Will Ferrell gives one of the funniest performances I have ever witnessed in this movie.  When he talks it is hilarious... he can take the most mundane word and make it absolutely the funniest thing you have ever heard!!  I have heard alot people say the movie was way over done... like the fight scene, but the movie made fun of itself...now how great is that.  After the over done and elaborate fight scene Ron and the gang are just sitting in his office making fun of the whole scene in a great sarcastic tone.  People didn't get it.. my friends didn't...they thought it was stupid but it was supposed to be.  They even made that known during the movie!  Christina Applegate is great in the film her and Will Ferrell just are a knock out combination.  Every scene in this movie is funny.. whether we are given a glimpse of \\"pleasure town\\" or enjoying Ron's great flute playing, this movie is slam dunk!  Please watch this and then re watch it because laughing is food for the soul and this movie is a four course meal!!
B00004Z459|1.0|I agree with Pete. Linkin Park is just MTV rubbish. They get way too much radio play and they're on MTV way too much, and they're not really heavy at all. Same beats, same riffs, same lyrics repeated all over and over again. Chester Bennington is the most whiniest vocalist I ever heard, his screaming is so weak, and of course Mike Shinoda is a pathetic excuse for a rap vocalist as well. Phil Anselmo whips both their sorry asses anytime, and of course his screaming is way more stronger and agressive than Chester's. For REAL metal, listen to old Metallica, Pantera, Killswitch Engage, Superjoint Ritual, Down, Chimaira, Slayer, Shadows Fall, Arch Enemy, Deicide, Mastodon, Cannibal Corpse, Dimmu Borgir, Cradle Of Filth, Cattle Decapitation, Sepultura, Carcass, and Morbid Angel. Spare yourself from this, it's nothin but overrated mainstream crap.
B00007ELEL|4.0|Ok so I have this english teacher and she would spend a good amount of class time quoting this movie.  Finally, I had to sit down and watch this flick.  I loved it- the one liners are what makes this movie.  I also find it comforting to know there is a movie out there that is intelligently written, and yet, the viewer in no way has to use their brain to pick through the plot.  This movie is one crazy situation after another, and the crazy antics of \\"The Dude!\\"  The Coen Brothers score major points here in my book!   <br />    This movie is just hilarious, it is not complicated and it just flows so smoothly and without any boring moments!  You will walk away from this movie with a smile on your face and a whole new set of one liners you can entertain your friends with!!!  Don't we all wish we could emulate the \\"Dude\\" and spend all day bowling and drinking white russians... this movie shows the value of a drama free and non-complicated existance!  And John Goodman is hilarious... this movie has some of the funniest characters you will ever see... I mean come on a vietnam obsessed war participator and Donny... poor Donny! Oh and the bowler with the hair net... I mean how hilarious is that!!  This movie is just funny and happy... and don't we all need to watch a happy movie sometimes.. I know I do!!
B00005JMAH|5.0|When, oh when, will *all* people realize that typing in all caps comes across as screaming? Not because someone decided it was poor manners...but because reading it is truly irritating? Lemmie guess...you prefer a bare, 150 watt lightbulb screwed into a socket in the ceiling rather than a soft, eye-level, shaded lamp, right? That's much like what you are doing, Edith..  Makes me wanna smack someone. <br /> <br />Meanwhile.... <br /> <br />This is, by far, the best of the three.  Visually stunning, and for Rickmaniacs, sexy, I am sure. Gorgeous, dark, and satisfying. Enjoy.
0805047905|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone with small kids.  Both of my boys have loved this book starting from about 18 months.  My 6 year old now loves to 'read' it to his little brother.  An extra bonus - it is great for learning colors and animals.
B0000039PW|5.0|If i was only allowed to purchase one cd in my lifetime, i would choose this cd.  Enough said.
0060245867|5.0|\\"Cookie\\" is my almost 3 year old's favorite book.  He can almost recite it to me after reading it so many times.  My almost 6  year old still loves it too.  A great book that will be a favorite for many years!
B00003CXC6|5.0|This film is really something special - it has received so many good reviews that another one is kind of redundant - but I am sure there are quite a few people out there who have not seen it - so if I can convince someone to watch it I think it is worth my time. This is one of the finest Japanese films I have seen - I am not particularly into the whole samurai genre - so this philosophical film about truth is probably my favorite Kurosawa film - and along with Ozu's 'Tokyo Story' and 'Floating Weeds' my favorite Japanese film. My favorite aspect of the film is the photography - the atmospheric qualities - the rain, the lighting, the forest with sun coming through the trees. Even the close-ups of people are very powerful and every bit as classically cinematic as anything from hollywood. The story is so intriguing as well - I don't think the act of murder is really the focus of the film - it is more like an incidental element - the morality is not what is being examined - it is more about the nature of story-telling - so Kurosawa in a way is examining himself - the story-teller. Thus, we are at a duplicity - and one that leads to philosophical contemplation - something central to art.
B000000OQF|5.0|In my opinion, this is the greatest album of all time. I first brought this album as an 8 year old back in '88 and it still rates as my favourite album. No filler tracks on here. The album opens with the famous 'Welcome to the Jungle' and ends with the awesome 'Rocket Queen'. There is not one bad song on this album, Still the only album to this day which i can play from start to finish. Hopefully axl and slash can reconcile their differences because they complement each other. A must have in any CD collection
B00003CXE7|5.0|I thought nothing could top \\"Spartacus,\\" especially the love story between Spartacus and Varinia.  There is a poetry in that screenplay that just sings and elevates.  However, Maximus offers a worthy successor in the arena and even wins the love of a dying emperor as well as his daughter.  The son, however, is another matter--at first Joaquin Phoenix looks completely foppish and in no way the equal of Maximus--until he starts scheming.  His jealousy over the love of his father adds a dimension to what could have been a thoroughly despicable characterization.<br /><br />Maximus fights for his freeedom, he fights for vengeance, he fights for the honor of his executed family.  Human nature hasn't changed since ancient Rome.  Certain values are timeless, and that is why this movie speaks to us.
B000000H5J|5.0|Totally awesome album. Would rate in my Top 10 albums of all time. Burton C. Bell is in my opinion the best Hard Rock/ Metal vocalist at the moment. His ability to go from scream to sing is unbelievable and he complements the pulsating guitars and drums which make Fear Factory unique. There are still a few fillers (Body Hammer, Flashpoint)but the rest of the album is unbelievable. Demanufacture, Zero Signal, Replica, New Breed, Self Bias Resistor and PissChrist are all incredible songs. A great album. Must have
6305252521|5.0|A truly great satire on the ultimate reality show with one of the all time best roles for Jim Carrey since \\"Doing Time on Maple Drive.\\"  I haven't seen \\"The Majestic,\\" or \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" but Carrey does have the ability to act given the right material.  Laura Linney and Natascha McElhone are wonderful too.
B000000OSE|5.0|After four years in exile G'n'R's follow up was a long time coming. The Best songs on Both Use Your Illusion Discs would rival Appetite for Destruction as a masterpiece. This album is good and has some great songs but there are a few shockers which belong on B-Sides (ie.You Aint The First, Bad Apples). <br /> <br />1. Right Next Door To Hell 9/10 - Great Opening track - Heavy, Short, Sharp and To the Point. Written by Axl Rose about his intrusive next door neighbour whom had a bottle broken over her head by Axl after she interrupted him one too many times.  <br />2. Dust n Bones 6.5/10 - A Bluesy Type of Song with Izzy on the vocals and Axl on the Piano. Not a Bad song but definitely not one of GnR's greatest. <br />3. Live & Let Die 8/10 - You've all heard it before. Not a bad song. Better than Dust and Bones but again not a great song. <br />4. Dont Cry 8.5/10 - A lot of gunners fans really dig this song. It is a bit soft and mellow for my liking but is still a good song. Check out the film clip its a cracker. <br />5. Perfect Crime 9.5/10 - Not much wrong with this song. Heavy, Short and Sharp and to the point with Controversial Lyrics. Would have liked to see this song directly follow The opening track. One of my favourites on this album <br />6. You Aint the First 0/10 - The worst gunners song of all time. Something that u would hear played at a barn dance. What were they thinking. <br />7. Bad Obsession 7/10 - Not a bad song. Seems to be a favourite among some gunners fans but definitely not one of the classics. A bit of a bluesy song featuring harmonica and slide guitar solo's. <br />8. Back off Bitch 7.5/10 - A good rock n roll song. Not Bad but again not a classic <br />9. Double Talking Jive 9/10 - Great Song! Again short and sharp and to the point and controversial lyrically. The song fades out with Slash playing a classical guitar solo. <br />10. November RAin 9.5/10 - A MAsterpiece! Great Song although it does drag on a bit. Great Ending. Slash is unbelievable. Still gives me goose bumps even after nearly 15 years of hearing this song. Great Film Clip <br />11. The Garden 9/10 - Im a big fan of this song. Powerful guitar riffs and solo's by Slash with Alice Cooper guest vocalling.  <br />12. Garden of Eden 9.5/10 - Love this Song. Short, Sharp and to the point. Axl sings at Chipmunk speed and is probably the fastest Gunners song of all time.  <br />13. Dont Damn Me 9.5/10 - Another Great Song. Pretty underrated by most gunners fans but I like its sound. <br />14. Bad Apples 5/10 - Pretty Average. Belongs on a B Side. Very Bluesy <br />15. Dead Horse 6/10 - Not a big fan of this song. Pretty boring but most gunners fans dig it and it was played regularly at GnR Gigs. <br />16. Coma 7.5/10 - 10 minute epic. Duffs opening Bass Riff is excellent. ALmost more of a story than a song. Pretty good none the less. <br />Probably deserves 4.5/5. not their best but still a fantastic Album.
B00003CX95|5.0|\\"They may take our lives but they'll never take our freedom.\\"  Or our brides.  Mel Gibson outdoes himself in a passionate role that exemplifies the line \\"Every man dies.  Not every man really lives.\\"  An outstanding historical account of an uprising against tyranny.<br /><br />Michael Guerin of \\"Roswell\\" remarked with humor about watching \\"Braveheart,\\" \\"I'm still trying to get an accurate body count.\\"  Proof positive of how this movie has become part of our culture.  Like the violence in \\"Schindler's List\\" or \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" the gore is not for the squeamish but is never gratuitous.  What would you do without freedom?  Not be able to watch this wonderful movie, that's for sure.
B00006RU5B|2.0|let me first get something straight. I love Rage Against the Machine and SOundgarden. However Chris Cornells voice just does not suit RATM's style of music. The music is good but vocally this album is very poor. When your on to a good thing stick to it.
B00008EY9G|2.0|It's not schizophrenia in this movie, it's multiple personality disorder, which apparently affected the script.  Although John Cusack's always watchable and the \\"trapped strangers\\" plot usually rustles up some general creepiness, this movie could have been a lot better even with a flawed premise.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I'm not a strongly religious person, and the experience of this film for someone who does not accept on faith the divinity of Christ is simply that one is being shown something truly awful and evil--the brutality of the Romans and the Jews of that time in punishing an innocent person who represented a political threat. The furious anger of the crowds against Jesus is bizarre and frightening, but never explained, so it is represented as pure blood lust.<br /><br />As a purely political movie, one might say this film shows that when the awful power of the state is combined with the enthusiasms of the mob, true evil will be done.<br /><br />All that said, this movie is a depiction, not a drama, and watching it, you are a witness, not an audience, and, as a witness, at times you feel very uncomfortable with the way the violence is being presented. There is an unmistakeable love for blood in this film, and it is an open question whether it reinforces or undermines the message.  The only interesting character is Pontius Pilate, who struggles with his conscience (embodied on screen by his wife), but ultimately \\"washes his hands\\" of Christ to appease the angry mob.<br /><br />Gibson is still a man of Hollywood, and the movie does have a brilliant Hollywood ending; a brief image of Christ healed and resurrected, but bearing one very visible mark of his torments.  This image embodies the new covenant represented by Christ.  But its power probably depends on how much faith you have in Christ's divinity.  If you are like me, thinking of Christ as a great teacher, but not \\"God on earth\\" the blood and suffering will seem over the top.  If you are not like me, and feel that Christ was God walking among us, then I imagine you'll embrace this movie as a necessary and instructive lesson.
B00003CXA2|5.0|How can you not like Tom Hanks in this movie?  This is the Tom Hanks movie, other than \\"Big\\" (we'll see what happens with \\"Polar Express.\\")  You feel for Forrest throughout his life, particularly when he discovers he has a son (who's smart in IQ terms).  The \\"holy fool\\" Forrest gets a boost from sarcastic Gary Sinise (who's got a reason to be bitter), Sally Field, and the terrific Robin Wright Penn.  Hanks' performance as a \\"slow\\" man ranks right up there with Robin's hubby Sean's in \\"I Am Sam\\" and Dustin Hoffman's in \\"Rain Man.\\"
B00003CXDV|5.0|I loved this movie basically because of the irony and the way it makes fun of Star Trek series!!!! I just laughed big time. Also the casting was well-asemblied and what to say about the special effects.  <br /> <br />Tim Allen finds his way to the chair of the commander and show us how the hero always get to showoff! pretty funny!!  <br /> <br />I loved Sigourney Weaver in her role of the bimbo co-helper to the commander. She manages to emulate the pamela-Anderson-type-of-caracther that only appears as an accessory in a way that keep you at the edge of your seat out of laughing.  <br /> <br />Finally, the special effects, the comedy and soundtrack are splendid! A must-see!!!!!! <br />
B0000019PA|5.0|I can't say anything more to you than, \\"go buy this album.\\" While it has some catchy songs, and the lyrics are beautifully surreal, it's so much more than that. This is one of the few pieces of music that I can say has moved me, and continues to do so. I find it is best to leave this disc in its case until things start to get topsy-turvy in your world--you're depressed, something bad happens, your life is starting to feel like a Burroughs novel, whatever--and then you play it. Mr. Mangum & Co. have kept me afloat more times than I care to count, and you can't help but feel better after giving \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea\\" a listen. These guys remind me what's so beautiful about being alive...pardon me now, while I head outside to dance among the fallen leaves with Jeff.
B0000683DH|5.0|The Creme de la Creme of the Star Trek movies. <br />It's got it all...the story, the suspence, the humour, the emotion, and an awsome soundtrack. The villain is great......Khan has brought more emotion into his part than his earlier parts on the Star Trek series, and really seems to relish the role as a man tortured by what James T Kirt did to him. Shatner is on top form, showing us a breadth of acting talent, with a very moving scene with him and pointy ears.  <br />This a a really moving film and you don't have to be a Trek fan to appreciate the quality of the film. <br />Watch it NOW or i'll banish you to Seti Alpha 7.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin Degraw's debut album is undoubtedly the best disc I've bought by a new artist ever.  He is extraordinary at combining musical intellect with a catchy pop-rock song.   <br />The double disc release of his debut album allows a listener to become intimate with his music.  I am looking forward to when he will travel to Columbus OH....
B0002HTZJI|5.0|This is without a doubt the best live recording i have ever heard by any band, the beauty of Flea and John jamming out in between several tracks is just so moving. And the new songs Rolling Sly Stone and Leverage of Space are so far up to par with anything else i have heard from rhcp. Get this album now.
B000021Y77|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Visually, it is a very beautiful movie.  The characters, even the minor ones, are intriguing.  The plot is exciting and revolutionary.  And finally, the soundtrack is wicked awesome. <br />Franka Potente is an amazing actress,there is more evidence of this in the Bourne Identity.  She has lots of charisma and pulls you into the movie.  Manni actually wasn't too bad.  He and Lola are both pretty weird people so its ok. <br />Applause to the Germans, you've come up with a really good one here! Sehr gut!
B00006LWSF|5.0|This is one of the better soundtracks I've heard (up there w/ Training Day, Gang Related & Cradle 2 The Grave).  Most of the songs on here are quality and there is only a couple of weak R&B songs.  Features alot of Shady/Aftermath artists with a track by D12, 5 by Eminem, 3 with Obie Trice, 4 with 50 Cent and a few other big names are on here too (Xzibit, Gangstarr, Rakim, Jay Z, Nas, Freeway).  I would definately recommend this album for any rap fan as it has a lot of quality songs you can listen too(even has 3 out of 6 good songs on the bonus disc). <br /> <br />#1 - 9.5 (Eminem - talkin' about what music does to him) <br />#2 - 8.5 - (Eminem, 50 Cent, Obie Trice) <br />#3 - 10 (classic Eminem song) <br />#4 - 9 - (Obie Trice) <br />#5 - 9.5 (50 Cent) <br />#6 - 10 (classic by: D12 f/ 50 Cent on the hook) <br />#7 - 8 (Jay Z f/ Freeway) <br />#8 - 9.5 (Xzibit) <br />#9 - 2 (Macy Gray) <br />#10 - 5.5 (a not so good song by NAS) <br />#11 - 8.5 (old overplayed song by 50 Cent but I liked it before I heard it everyday) <br />#12 - 3 (bookmat) <br />#13 - 8 (Rakim) <br />#14 - 3 (Young Zee - this cat can't rap too good at all) <br />#15 - 8.5 (Gangstarr) <br />#16 - 10 (classic by Eminem) <br /> <br />BONUS DISC <br />#1 - 8 (Obie Trice) <br />#2 - 9 (Eminem) <br />#3 - 10 (50 Cent classic Freestyle over Eminem beat from \\"The Eminem Show\\") <br />#4 - 5 (Joe Beast) <br />#5 - 3 <br />#6 - 2 <br /> <br />P.S. --- check all of my reviews ----
B0002SROT0|5.0|thank you elliott, for this last beautiful, timeless record. you are missed.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I have to say that I was disappointed in the theatrical release.  I was floored by the visuals when I saw it in the theater, but once I watched it at home, the flaws in the storytelling were really glaring.  The whole movie felt choppy and disjointed.  The extended version, however, is an infinitely better movie.  I must admit that some of the extra Treebeard scenes are a bit much (although they're *supposed* to be boring), however, on the whole, the flow is MUCH better, and everything just *makes sense* in this version.  I was initially *very* upset by the changes made to Faramir's character, but with the backstory in the extended version, it is *much* more believable and acceptable.  I was also quite put out by the whole Aragorn-going-over-a-cliff thing until I heard the explanation for it in the documentary.  But again, something about the extra scenes made just made it make more sense, I don't know why.  And the Arwen scenes didn't seem so out of place, either. <br />So, while it is flawed, I still have to give it five stars just by virtue of it being such a VAST improvement over the theatrical version.
0140277447|5.0|I read \\"The Rape of Nanking:The Forgotten Holocaust of WWII\\" and I thought it was a great book. I didnt even know that the Japanese went to war with the Chinese, and I learned a lot about it since I have read it. Iris Chang gave so many details of the gruesome war that I couldnt believed it happened. You could just imagine how the victims felt through the authors words. How Chang found the few remaining survivors is amazing. The victims are mostly elderly and they still remember the war and can tell you the stories they went through or witnessed. The author, in my sense, justs wants people to realize that this did happen, a forgotten holocaust. For people to know about this is how it is kept prevented from happening again. I realized that when I read this book that wars like that are still going on in this world. I really enjoyed this book from every perspective. I gained so much more knowledge of what had happened some odd years ago.
B0000E2FLC|2.0|The sound is obviously not from this concert, that makes it awful. <br /> <br />I'd expect something like this from Britney, Madonna, Milli Vanilli, Ashlee Simpson, etc. I can even take the disclaimer on VH's DVD that says.. \\"we recorded this over 2 different shows to get all the video\\" and I can handle the Zep DVD where they did an AWESOME job considering that they had limited video to work with. <br /> <br />Other reviews have said \\"Disconcerting.\\" It is downright awful. The sad thing is that the audio is a good rendition of their work and the video makes it appear that it was one smokin' show, they are just not the same. RUSH in Rio was a show with low-quality audio, but you knew when Lifeson was playing, it was not some studioed-up version.  <br /> <br />The liner says \\"One of the greatest live concert documents of all time.\\" This is only true if Winston Smith was doing the documentation of the concert. They had 26 cameras, but apparantly forgot to plug them into the microphones.
B000063DI8|4.0|Okay, so when \\"Prayer\\" first came out, I gave it a listen and shelved it, nothing on the album really stood out for me at the time. Just recently I have begun pulling out my Maiden disks again, and maybe because I listened to the god-awful \\"Virtual XI\\" before listening to \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\"...but this is a pretty solid Maiden album, and I don't think it deserved the harsh reviews I see posted here. \\"Tailgunner\\" kicks this disk off well, and fits solidly with Maiden classice \\"Aces High\\" and \\"The Trooper\\". \\"Bring your Daughter to the Slaughter\\" is a fun little tune, and I am pretty sure this was in a horror flick that came out around the time of this album's release, I remember seeing it on the soundtrack. The title track \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\", \\"Hooks In You\\" and \\"Holy Smoke\\" are all pretty good songs featuring the Iron Maiden trademarks fans love, Steve Harris' wicked bass, Bruce Dickinson's banshee-like vocals, and great guitar work by Dave Murray and this time around Janick Gers. \\"Mother Russia\\" wraps ups the album nicely, and is another solid track. I think what \\"No Prayer\\" is missing is that one anchor song found on most Maiden disks...tunes like \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Alexander the Great\\" and \\"To Tame a Land\\". All of the tunes clock in on the disk at under 6 minutes, the band dumped the guitar-synth and went back to basics on this album. This album follows the same formula as \\"Killers\\", just straight ahead rockers, and \\"No Prayer\\" is definately worth another listen, and has the power to grow on you. But I do have a question....on my copy of \\"No Prayer\\", on the cover, Eddie is grabbing a guy by the throat from his crypt..on the covers I see featured on Amazon, it's just Eddie reaching from the grave...what happened to the original cover?
0380789035|1.0|As a fan of creative writing with a good deal of patience, I gave my best effort to get through this novel, but had to give up in frustration. Gaiman's theme, while worthwhile in its premise, is executed poorly through incomplete character development, vulgarity, and pointless detail in scene description. His shortcomings in plot consistency and justification for many characters leaves the reader often asking for more explanation, more development, and too many questions as to what the point of this work is.<br /><br />Given there are so many other works out there much more worth our time and effort, I recommend readers look elsewhere for better creative writing in this vein, such as Neil Stephenson.
B000002UAU|5.0|I know all the magazines (well, most of them) rate this the greatest album ever, and it seems repetitive to say so, but Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is truly the most astounding, mind altering album of rock music ever produced by anyone. Initially, it may sound light and even funny, but listen closely, and follow the words along with the music, and something totally opposite appears.  I'm not going to take anyone by the ear and explain every nuance, just listen for yourself. Also, you must remember the time period that this was made.  It is of its time.  Beyond classic.
B000002UB6|4.0|Where to start: I was disappointed with the release of \\"Let it Be-Naked\\" I loved the version of \\"Long and Winding Road\\" on LitBN but was disappointed with \\"Let it Be\\". I take issue with the statement that one reviewer made that the single was better than the overdubbed guitar on the album. I believe that the raw lead on the album contrasted nicely with the almost serene Gospel feel of the song. I think 'Let it Be' with its overdubs is a better album than \\"Let it Be-Naked\\".
B00000I8NC|5.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor really are something else. I'm not even going to bother writing a long review because I simply can't find the words. The music is so beautiful, emotional and majestic yet also sad and moody - it conjures up so many emotions at once. Moya, the first track on this EP, is arguably their best song and it sends chills down my spine every time I hear it. Words cannot describe the greatness of the CD so I'll just say this. If you want something some sweeping, epic, climatic and down-right spine chilling then this rock orchestra is a band you must hear. NOW.
B000002HH9|5.0|4.5 stars is what it deserves, but I'd rather it has a 5 than a 4. Other than \\"Friday I'm in love\\", I'd heard almost no cure, prior to purchasing this back in 96. I saw them performing Mint Car on Much Music and thought what the heck. So, I bought it, and it's got some incredible songs. My favourite are \\"Return\\" and \\"Round and round\\". Crank them up, and let them play :)
B0001NBMBC|5.0|im a semi big fan of this band, i like some of their songs, but most are just too hard and too incoherent to like.  this album makes this band turn the corner from shock rock nonsense to true music.  just an incredible album, PARTICULARLY vermillion and vermillion part 2.  true maggots wont like these i think, but the rest of us, who like Tool, and APC, and like some of slipknots stuff will love it.  i like almost every song on this album, a true triumph.
6305971099|5.0|Why are people so insane and critical about every little thing in every film? How many times have you personally heard people bash a film on the basis of high expectations? There is no number high enough to even begin to reach the amount of phlack that films get from some of the stupidest people you'll ever meet. Sometimes, I wish there was no such thing has preview trailers, television spots, and people expressing what doesn't need to be expressed.<br /><br />  So is the case with \\"Halloween 5:The Revenge of Michale Myers.\\" The first 'Halloween\\" film was an unexpected success. People flocked to it on the basis of small coments and reviews: \\"brilliant, smart, too real to beleive.\\" But, as a matter of fact, these same reviews had previously called it everything besides those three comments and any sensible word that Webster can think up. So my question of the day: should we delete these beautiful things we call reviews?<br /><br />  Sure, it's great that everyone gets an opinion. Without that fact, I wouldn't even be able to be writing this now. But sometimes I wish that people either weren't allowed to read reviews before watching films. I beleive people should go into a movie theatre with an open mind and sense of what they're saying.<br /><br />  Obviously, the other reviews failed to realise this fact when writing their desription of the fifth film in the \\"Halloween\\" series. It is not the best film ever made which seems to be the standard these so-called reviews made when judging this great film. I love little Danielle Harris and the up-and-coming Ellie Cornell. Donal Pleasance is at a great peak, and the script is wonderful. End of story.<br /><br />  Sure, this isn't the best, but it's not supposed to be. So, I've given this film a five on it's content and everything therin.
B00005JM02|5.0|OMG, I was reading all the one star reviews and I was amazed at what i saw. \\"Uh it scared my 3 and 5 year old kids, ahh its too scary for kids ahh, why is it G ahhh\\" grow up you stupid parents. If your kids are afraid of it that is their problom, not the movies. All you parents can't write reviews. First of all it is called a \\"movie review\\", not a \\"how did you react to it thing\\". When you write a review you focus on how you liked it not on how your 5 your old over protected rich kid was scared by the sharks. I mean if you really hated the movie thats cool but don't just give it one star because you'r kids are to immature to handle a death they didn't even see in this movie. <br />Anyway, I loved this movie. I have always been somewhat of a fan of Disney. I really like the Pixar company, they did a good jpb on all of their animated movies. I liked the story of this, and that if your a KID or an adult you can ENJOY it and LAUGH at it. There is humor kids will get and then humor that will go over the kids head and you will laugh at. It is really entertaining, and enjoyable. It is a movie for EVERYONE to see.
B00018D44U|5.0|This CD was an unexpected, pleasant surprise.  I was expecting \\"Come Away With Me Part Two\\" but instead, Norah Jones delivers a very fresh and new approach that heralds another winner.  Norah brings in some country and folk influences and adds them to her smooth, breathy jazz, and the result is something a little more kicky and fun.  Still, there are plenty of ballads to enjoy and it all still goes down smooth. Norah remains true to her vision, and this CD won't alienate any of her fan base. I really enjoy \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton.  Norah and Dolly ought to do an entire CD (and tour) with each other.  Their voices sound so sweet together.
B000002I2M|5.0|\\"L.A. Woman\\" is the final album put together by the Doors before the death of Jim Morrison and what is so striking about it for me is how the two best tracks, the title one and \\"Riders of the Storm,\\" are so different from the rest of what is on the album.  Contrasting the start of those tracks with the opening song on the album, \\"The Changeling,\\" and they are like night and day.  Most of the rest of this 1971 album is really blues oriented, with \\"Love Her Madly\\" clearly being the best of the bunch, and some of the rest being instantly forgettable.  I think it is obvious that the band was trying to get back their credibility after veering too far in the direction of pop for a couple of albums, with \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and this one righting those wrongs.  But since a few of these songs are pretty forgettable, \\"L.A. Woman\\" is an album that is caught between a 4 and a 5 but you have to round up given how good its two best songs end up being.<br /><br />My two favorite parts of Oliver Stone's movie \\"The Doors\\" is when we hear Ray Manzarek in the background fooling around on the organ until he gets the bit for \\"Light My Fire\\" right and the end credits with the tracking shot showing the record of \\"L.A. Woman,\\" with Val Kilmer's Morrison taking advantage of the great acoustics in the bathroom.  For years when I was driving back from the Twin Cities and coming up the final hills before being able to see the lights of home, to wit the \\"city of lights,\\" \\"L.A. Woman\\" was the song I would play in the car because it perfectly suited the moment.<br /><br />Since the track opens with the sound of an accelerating car engine it is easy to see why the songs is associated with driving.  Robbie Krieger simulates that sound on his guitar, but with a hint of eeriness that leads into first Manzarek's keyboards and then John Densmore's cymbal tapping and session player Jerry Scheff's throbbing bass.  From that intriguing beginning the song generates its compelling rhythm and allows Morrison to wax lyrical.  The bridge represents one of the most creative changes in rock history, using a tango tempo while Morrison sings about burning hair before getting to the final section where the anagrammatic \\"Mr. Mojo Risin'\\" makes his appearance.  On a lot of these tracks Morrison's voice sounds about shot, but there are no complaints about \\"L.A. Woman,\\" which qualifies as his last great vocal performance.<br /><br />\\"Riders of the Storm\\" is one of the moodiest Doors' songs and the lyrics create a sense of foreboding (e.g., \\"Into this house were born/Into this world we're thrown\\") representing the questionable side of human existence.  Musically Manzarek captures the sound of the storm, with actual thunderstorm sound effects dubbed on to the track, while Densmore again works the cymbals and Scheff provides a simple bass line, reflecting a minimalist approach that is quite effective.  The song made it to #14 on the Billboard charts after Morrison's death in Paris (\\"Love Her Madly\\" had made it to #11 while the title track was just too long for AM radio).  The \\"L.A. Woman\\" album only made it to #9, which, believe it or not, makes it the worst performance by a Doors album.  Of course, a decade later Morrison and the Doors were bigger than ever and \\"L.A. Woman\\" was a frequent mention as the group's best track.he bridge represents one of the most creative changes in rock history, using a tango tempo while Morrison sings about burning hair before getting to the final section where the anagrammatic \\"Mr. Mojo Risin'\\" makes his appearance.

B0002XNT0I|5.0|Philadelhia is one one of the best and most powerful movies of all time. The fact that this movie is finally getting the 2-disc treatment it deserves is really great. Tom Hanks won an Oscar for his powerful portrayal as an AIDS-infected lawyer who decides to fight back. <br /> <br /> <br />However, to me the best performance is given by Denzel Washington. His character is the one that shows the most growth over the two hour movie. His speeches and even just his facial expressions convey more emotion in this movie than most actors would ever dream of. <br />
1400049628|5.0|Max Brooks, (son of the famous Mel) has surprised many with his amazing knowledge of the undead in this wonderfully detailed and almost complex manual of survival against the living dead. What is absolutely amazing about this book is that its humor is so wonderful and dark, and at times even brings you to question if he wrote it to be funny or if he really does think that zombies have attacked humanity before and are ready to uprise again. <br />  Which brings me to another point. When reading this book, it doesn't necessarily hit you as being humor, its more in the fact that there IS a zombie survival guide and its detailed that is really where the humor is. When you read it you are engrossed in a very real and logical universe of the eminent possibility and emergency of a real zombie attack. After you put the book down, you laugh and tell everyone you know what to do now if there is a real zombie attack. Oddly enough, this book actually feels like a horror film. When you watch a zombie movie, you are too busy wondering how \\"that character\\" is going to react, but it never feels like \\"YOU\\". when you read this manual, you start to imagine how you would hole up in your own home if there was a zombie attack, and then you imagine how you'd handle your own personal loved ones becoming zombies, and just how scary it would be to have to personally battle a zombie hand to hand or with a melee weapon.  <br />  Amazingly enough, this book is very straightforward and reads just like a standard survival guide, even making references to other tactics of survival and directs you towards learning wilderness survival if the battle for survival depends on you trekking through minimally infested (but still dangerous) wildnerness.   <br />   Probably the funniest thing about this book are the awesome illustrations, especially the diagram of the man with the axe chopping down the staircase. They make you giggle from time to time, actually making an effort to become lighthearted at times, albeit any humor you contract from this book is very dark and oddly enough, it gave me a survival nighmare at one point. The reread factor of this book is wonderfully high, and its perfect for halloween or as a gift for the zombie buff or horror film lover. <br />   As a matter of fact, my uncle who is a math teacher at a high school told me he also has this book and reads it to his advanced math classes before tests, and when the students ask him why, he says its because they need to excersize their brains to use logic even in the most illogical situations (or something to that effect) i thought that was pretty cool. <br /> <br />All in all, Max Brooks' Zombie survival guide: complete protection from the living dead is worth all 5 stars because of amazing writing, research, and humor.  Looking forward to a volume 2 if that is indeed a future project Max Brooks would consider.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002SROSQ|5.0|It is no exaggeration to suggest that this album is as intense, flawless and biting as the most lauded masterpieces rock has ever produced -- albums like \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" \\"Berlin\\" or \\"Songs of Love and Hate.\\" Past Cave records, such as \\"Let Love In\\" with its onslaught of feisty gothic blues or \\"Boatman's Call\\" with its lullabies to the fallen world, seemed to showcase only one side or the other of Nick Cave's wildly unpredictable muse. Only this latest effort manages to fuse both of those creative dimensions into the kind of rich, varied and gripping sound I suspect he hoped to achieve on the disappointing \\"Nocturama.\\" These are precisely the chilling, cryptic and heartbreaking performances one would expect of an aging Nick Cave. On \\"There She Goes, My Beautiful World,\\" with its blazing chrous of back-up singers, it sounds like the whole world is singing along, crowded into a single studio and loving it. The immediacy of these perfomances is powerful and engaging enough to command the attention of the universe itself. These are less songs than they are revelations, and even the glorious \\"No More Shall We Part\\" seems but a skeletal draft of what was to come here on \\"Abattoir Blues\\" and the quieter but no less menacing \\"Lyre of Orpheus.\\" Along with Tears For Fears's \\"Everybody Loves A Happy Ending\\" and Modest Mouse's latest album, Cave's new double-disc set constitutes some of the most powerful and honest music to surface in years.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I don't understand.  All of these movies are supposed to take place after Episodes I and II, but for some reason, the technology disimproved.  I'm so confused that I just wanna pee my pants.
0345350499|5.0|When I first read this book, I was, quite simply, in awe. It has since been seven years and many more reads. It is, by far, the best of the lot of feminist retellings of the Arthurian legends. It may even be the best version I have ever read of the King Arthur legend, period, and that's saying a lot. Marion Zimmer Bradley is a brilliant writer, and she hooks you from the beginning. You will love and sympathize with Morgaine, the usual \\"heavy\\" of King Arthur stories, who in this novel is a strong, powerful, compassionate character and yet at the same time, very human. I wouldn't dream of spoiling this novel for anyone by releasing any plot points, but there are some new twists in this legend that will FLOOR you! After you've read it, be sure and watch the Mists of Avalon made-for-TV movie on DVD. It isn't exactly the same as the book, but it is well-acted and very enjoyable as well.
B00005JMJG|5.0|The best movie I've seen this year.  Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are wonderful in this movie.  I never get tired of watching it.
0140390693|5.0|This book is a classic favorite, especially for girls from the age of about 11-14 (depending of the reading level of the girl).  Its made all the better for this age set because there are sequels- \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" which continue the saga of the March sisters.  The lives of these girls is related in an exciting way- sometimes gently moralizing (19th century middle class Protestant Christian values), sometimes sad, sometimes innocently romantic.  The book is a good gift for any young girl who likes historical fiction, and has always been a treasured hand-me down in our family.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|While I cannot agree with those who call this pair of albums Cave's \\"best\\" - (what is \\"best?\\") they do represent Mr. Cave at a very creative point in his career and . . . well, they are amazing.  <br /> <br />It soon becomes a case of comparing two distinctive wonderful albums with each other. Pairing these two contrasting albums together (in interesting somewhat feminine packaging reminiscent of a scrapbook) with a single, unifying libretto/booklet was a fascinating idea.  In the case of an artist as strongly individual and as creative as Nick, it means a good, solid listen to music of genius; music created to provoke thought as well as listening pleasure.  God bless Nick Cave!  <br /> <br />The more immediate of the two discs would seem to be Abbatoir, while Orpheus, at least on first hearing, seeming to be one of those works which will take its time to work its complete magic on me . . . and I can't wait for that to happen! <br /> <br />Abbatoir's \\"There she goes my beautiful world\\" had me stopping the disc and playing it over about 4 more times as loud as my neighbors would put up with and singing along at the top of my lungs.  An amazingly vibrant song that is infectious in its use of rhythm and sound. <br /> <br />The first cut of \\"Orpheus\\" - the title track - is quite astonishing as Nick lends his own twist to the Orpheus and Euridice legend.  Alternately humorous and touching it is streaked with blood and tweaked with violence, a singular masterpiece in and of itself.   <br /> <br />This, of course, in complete contrast to the final song \\"O Children\\" - a haunting, sprawling anthem rich with imagery and poetry and sung on almost a whisper.   <br /> <br />A great and stunning achievement from Mr. Cave and his merry band.  My highest recommendation.  Get it.  Now. <br />
B0002JJBZE|5.0|With ratings that disappointed NBC, \\"Star Trek\\" quickly became targeted for cancellation by the end of the second season. The second season doesn't lack quality however it ranked in the ratings. Noted science fiction writers Theodore Sturgeon and Norman Spinrad along with fantasy and horror writer Robert Bloch turned in some of the finest episodes during season two. Sturgeon's \\"Amok Time\\" established a culture for Spock and established much of the mythology of the planet Vulcan. Spinrad's well written \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" proved a brilliant metaphor for the arms race when a machine that literally eats planets as part of its destructive pattern appears in our galaxy. While the optical effects were underwhelming at times (the USS Defiant which is destroyed is built from earlier, smaller Enterprise model. At the time it was suggested that an AMT model kit was used but that has since been dismissed by those associated with the show ), the acting of guest William Windom was top notch and the taunt direction overcame these defects. Bloch's two contributions included the Halloween thriller \\"Catspaw\\" and the murder mystery \\"Wolf in the Fold\\". Both are top notch with strong performances from all the regular cast. Jerome Bixby (\\"Fantastic Voyage\\", the classic short story \\"It's a Good Life\\") contributed the alternate universe episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" where, due to a transporter accident Kirk, Bones, Scotty and Uhura are transported to an Enterprise whose mission is to conquer alien races, take what they want and kill those who get in the way. The late producer/writer Gene L. Coon contributes the terrific \\"Metamorphosis\\". Coon's humorous \\"A Piece of the Action\\" mined new territory for the series with its witty script and tongue-in-cheek tone.  The talented writer Dorothy Fontana provides one of the finest episodes of the season with \\"Journey to Babel\\" about a meeting on the Enterprise between a variety of alien races and the discord one terrorist tries to create by murdering one of the delegates. Then of course there was neophyte writer David Gerrold's \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" (and his uncredited rewrite on the humorous \\"I Mudd\\"). Gerrold later became a Hugo and Nebula winning writer and his early career was nurtured by Roddenberry among many others.<br /><br />There are many that felt that the second season didn't quite live up to the first but the characters had clear identities and the writing was just as strong with some of the finest episodes produced during season two. Certainly there were clunkers (Roddenberry's own \\"The Omega Glory\\" is among the worst the series ever produced) but the second season was every bit the equal of the first season. The optical effects also improved with fewer bad mattes (in some of the first season episodes the Enterprise appears transparent at times) and the acting became more self assured.<br /><br />The picture quality is still stellar. Produced from the same master Paramount used for the Sci-Fi Channel debut and those produced for the individual sets released a couple of years ago, \\"TOS\\" looks exceptionally good with its rich day-glo 60's colors. The optical effects still look a bit dodgy but that's because they were produced using multiple exposures and, as a result, they're a bit less sharp with more grain (not a problem with the transfer per se)and also signficantly more analog debris.<br /><br />The special features will be of particular interest to \\"Trek\\" fans and I've got a preview from my promo copy of the last disc of the set I received. \\"Life After Trek\\" focuses (as did the first) on a hobby of a cast member. This time Leonard Nimoy's hobby of still photography is examined. I don't know that I would call it a hobby based on the quality of the images we see. We also hear Nimoy discuss his passion for photography and see some of his prints, his darkroom, etc.<br /><br />\\"To Boldly Go\\" once again has Associate Producer Robert Justman, fan Bjo Trumble, Shatner and others dicuss their favorite episodes from season two. George Takei mentions his discomfort when Walter Koenig joined the show because he felt that Koenig might get some of his lines and screen time. Koenig points out that he never knew any of this and both comment on how they became good friends.  The featurette focuses on the classic David Gerrold episode \\"The Troulbe with Tribbles\\" as well discussing how the producers wanted to experiment with the tone of the show more.<br /><br />Walter Koenig also discusses his reception among the cast and why the show introduced his character (they were going after the \\"Davy Jones\\" look with his haircut). His character was designed to try and expand the audience as well. D. C. Fontana and the cast and crew also focus on their favorite episodes of season two as well.<br /><br />\\"Kirk, Bones and Spock: Star Trek's Great Trio\\" consists of interviews of Shatner, Nimoy and D. C. Fontana discussing the chemistry of the trio of actors playing the main roles. Fontana mentions that Deforest Kelley wasn't original a top billed actor in the series but became so as the chemistry of the three actors became apparent. George Takei focuses on the presence that Shatner brought to the role of Shatner (without dishing on their differences in the past). John D. F. Black (former story editor and writer on the show), Mary Black as well as fan Bjo Trimble (who spearheaded the save Star Trek campaign that kept the series on the air for a third seasons) also comment on how the three interplay of the three actors brought the show its unique flavor that reached out and appealed to the broader audience that NBC couldn't bring to the show. There's quite a bit of discussion also about the late Kelley's unique southern charm and how he integrated into the role of McCoy.<br /><br />\\"D.C. Fontana's Writer's Notebook\\" has former Trek story editor and writer Fontana expanding on the job of the story editor and what she brought to the table as both writer and editor expanding, revising and rewriting scripts with the participation of the show's writers. \\"Divine Diva: Nichelle Nicholls\\" focuses on the talented lady who played Uhura on the show. She discusses her beginnings in musical theater and how she ended up working on \\"Star Trek\\" Nicholls discusses how Roddenberry first cast her in his series \\"The Lieutenant\\" and how Roddenberry had the vision and guts to cast an African American actress in a prominent role on a prime time series that didn't fall into a stereotype. Evidently Nicholls suggested the name of Uhura for the character Roddenberry created for her (she actually read for Spock originally as the character didn't exist in the original series bible). It's a nice profile of one of Trek's most talented performers.<br /><br />\\"Designing the Final Frontier\\" features designer Matt Jeffries discussing how he came to \\"Star Trek\\". Originally Jeffries was going to work on one of three new series \\"Mission: Impossible\\", \\"Star Trek\\" or a new western. \\"Star Trek\\" came up for production first. His unique designs are also highlighted in both this featurette as well as a stills gallery. Associate Producer Robert Justman highlights the unique qualities that Jeffries brought to the show and how he tried to give it a fantastic element that had just a touch of reality to make it something the audience of the 20th Century could relate to as well. Jeffries focuses on his collaborative efforts with the optical effects house Howard Anderson Company, how he interacted with the other production members and the difficulty of juggling as many as seven episodes at a time when it came to pre-production.<br /><br />The set comes once again in the blue clam shell case (I believe it's designed to mirror the colors of the different shirts worn by the various crew members.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Having just seen this a few weeks ago, \\"Wicked\\" blew me away. I wasn't expecting such a spectacular staging. Like any good Broadway musical, it taps into every emotion in the book, and with two masterful performances in the leads, the material is given every chance to shine. Even when the material is a tad weak. <br />The story, as the other 293 reviewers have stated, needs not to be reiterated. However, I was continually surprised at how clever and funny the whole thing was. It's ingenious, and like, oh, probably a million other persons, went out and bought the novel right away. <br />This recording is an excellent souvenir of the show. Like most excerpted cast albums, you're gonna miss a lot. Quite a bit happens between songs... <br />...nevertheless... <br />...the songs that floored me initially are all here. Idina Menzel is simply amazing. Having followed her career since \\"Rent\\" and her solo album, it's a joy to see other people finally discovering what the rest of us have known for quite some time. <br />Kristin Chenoweth is absolutely hysterical. Her phrasing and timing are impeccable. The two together are formidable...the closing \\"For Good\\" tugs at the heart strings both the first and the fiftieth time you hear it. <br />And yes, \\"The Wizard and I\\" and \\"Defying Gravity\\" are the two standouts, and rightly so. Yet I find the humor of \\"Popular\\" and \\"What is This Feeling\\" just as memorable. <br />I agree with one previous reviewer that the supposedly \\"weak\\" songs are only so out of context. Trust me...during the show, they're essential. <br />When you're dipping into this album for songs, yes you will skip to the big ones. But I implore you from time to time to \\"put the needle\\" at the beginning, and let it run. For this and many other musicals, it's an exhilarating experience.
0395389496|5.0|My nine-year old loves this book!  The illustrations are beautiful and the narrative is engaging. We read it over and over again. A must have for every children's library.<br /><br />Debbie Farmer, author 'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat!'
B00004ZAV3|4.0|First of all, I know it's off-topic, but congratulations to the Boston Red Sox. Guess it really WAS their year this time. <br /> <br />Now on with the review. I think it's a pretty safe assumption that everybody on earth has at least HEARD of the Beatles. They were the voice of the sixties, and are considered by most to be the best pop/rock group in history. They introduced a new style and sound to America, started the British Invasion, and either directly or indirectly influenced just about every rock album made since 1964. Everybody knows the Beatles story, too; about Yoko Ono, the breakup, the drugs, the untrue \\"Paul Is Dead\\" rumour, the deaths of members John Lennon (RIP 1940-1980) and George Harrison (RIP 1943-2001). So you know several \\"Best Of\\" comps have been made. And, IMHO, this is the best one if you're just getting into the band. Here's why: <br /> <br />* Most of their known and loved hits are on here (that's what they are; the Beatles' #1 singles) <br />* It's affordable (unlike 1962-1966/1967-1970, which cost too much, although I have 1962-66 on vinyl) <br />* It shows their progression throughout their career, from \\"Love Me Do\\" to \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", which sound nothing like each other <br /> <br />However, I gave it four stars instead of five because there are some songs I would've liked to have had on here, including \\"And I Love Her\\" (one of the best, if not the best, slow/love songs ever), \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"A Day In The Life\\", and a couple others that escape me. But 4/5 is still a really good rating. <br /> <br />Since I started listening to the Beatles when I was around nine, you might say I was weened on Beatles music. It helped me to discover the word of music, in a way (along with Green Day's \\"Dookie\\" and my dad's old records from the fifties through the seventies). So I always have had a connection with the songs on here. It's a great way to discover music, like I said in the title. <br /> <br />Anyway,if you're just getting into the band, here would be a great place to start. Also, see if you can check out the Beatles documentary they did on ABC about a decade ago.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I love this cd! I've memorized the words to just about every song, even the italian ones, I listen to it so much. Josh Groban's rich voice gives me chills up my spine every time I hear him. He is an amazing singer! His songs are beautiful and the musicians behind him are great. I love all of his songs and would never be able to choose a favorite. They are all too good. The lyrics are very beautiful and touching(especially in My Confession...\\"for I feel my heart is turning, falling into place\\"...sigh...).My favorite part about his songs is the way they all build up to a climatic point. I am SO looking forward to future albums! If you are looking for a good voice, BUY THIS CD!! You will NOT be disappointed!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this cd i saw the show on Broadway with the oringal cast and i fell in love with it... the songs are all written great but there a few that stand out. if you have any question n your mind about buying this cd just listen to it there no other songs like the ones on this cd....who are you Elphba or Glinda?
B0002WYS6S|5.0|P.Q. is great, nice colors, good camera work.I think the mix is done well also i usally dont like live audio versions of my favorite bands im just weird that way, i might even buy the cd version and i dont like live stuff!!??? but watching it and hearing it together is a different story,on that note sounds pretty darn good.If your a D.T. fan just buy it youll love it!!Now for the bad,on the song \\"new millennium\\" right about at 1:35:30 a drop off in audio then it comes right back from then on the 5.1 mix is just plain off!!Dont get me wrong u can hear it fine but if your an audio/videophile youll notice it and it will bug you.The 2.0 mix is fine no problems,Every thing before 1:35:30 sounds great.You can go to mike portnoy's web site they address the issue there.4 choices; buy it deal with it. or buy it send email out and theyll send u a new disc. or wait, the new ones will be out in a few months,or u can buy the PAL version wich has no glitch.Again go to the web site i stated it will tell u about email.I'm going to buy one of the new ones when they come out and give the old one to my brother.
B00018D44U|1.0|Not at all like the 1st CD! The whole CD has a country sound. Too much of her back up singer in this one. Might as well be listening to Dolly Pardon! If you want to listen to country buy it. If you're looking for another CD with the sound and style of Come Away with Me, then keep looking!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I've seen all of the special editions, and I will not buy them.  I want the original movies, not these hacks.  Most of the new scenes are simply awful; much of the digital imagery doesn't fit the original feel and is poorly crafted - the new scenes look as if they were thrown together at the last minute without any faithfulness to the originals.  The Jabba scene in ANH is probably among the most blatant hack jobs, and the jabba's palace scene in ROtJ is a close runner-up.  There's also many instances of cut and/or changed dialogue.  These are most certainly NOT improvements.  My father used to say, \\"If something works don't fix it.  It's likely you'll screw it up.\\"  Lucas did just that.

B0002IQHY8|1.0|just as genesis should have quit while ahead and avoided the very average calling all stations, alan parsons should have stuck to what he's good at, instead of producing this batch of mind numbing repetetive dirge. <br />Yes there is a market for this kind of stuff but he should leave it to those who are better at it. <br />His albums over the years have been classics but if you were expecting the same you will be very dissapointed. <br />There is nothing more embarrasing when someone who patently isnt, trys to be hip. <br />What a sad episode in an otherwise brilliant career
0071373586|4.0|I would highly recommend this book, and I have recommended it to several people I have come into contact with who are looking to explore marketing options.  It is an easy read that contains valuable information for a day-to-day career.  If you have not spent time reading this book, I would highly recommend it for the content and theory not only the entertainment received from it.  I will keep this book and refer back to topics that would aid me in marketing the business in which I am associated with and marketing myself.  It has also encouraged me to continue reading books associated with other related business books.
0385335482|4.0|Rebecca Bloomwood is such a character!  The reader can almost feel the joy in her heart as she enters a store (any store);  she describes each sensation with such detail (the smells, the colors of the displays, etc.)  She's happy-go-lucky who's always trying to live above her means.  When the reader meets her mom, she gets an insight into Becky's character.  I cheered Becky on as she tried many ways to get control of her finances - I loved the part where Becky hides a pair of jeans from a customer so she can buy it herself and then gets fired.  Bex (as her friend Suze calls her) tries everything from getting another job to being frugal and is hilarious as she goes from one situation to another.  The ironic thing is that Becky works for a financial magazine! <br /> <br />I loved the ending (I won't give it away) because it seemed that Becky found her niche as well as learned a life lesson and found out something else..... <br /> <br />

Canadians have different dating rituals (one of my favorites).  Just needs a woman like myself to understand his complexities and to love him unconditionally.  What a load of crap.  Greg and Liz are right.  Either a man digs you or he doesn't.  Yes, this book is common sense but sometimes common sense goes out the window when the fantasy looks a whole lot better than reality.

B000002JS6|5.0|\\"Back in Black\\".. what can I say; it is truely a masterpiece that is renowned by many as the greatest hard rock album of all time.  Personally, it doesn't touch \\"High Voltage\\"; it is hard to beat 'Live Wire' and 'TNT'.  My suggestion to new listeners of AC/DC is to buy \\"High Voltage\\" before you get into this and other Brian Johnson era AC/DC albums.
1400034779|4.0|My typical reading habits usually steer me clear of the current bestseller list.  For the most part I find them overhyped, and patently disappointing.  Not so with this refreshing little foray into the engaging world of domestic intrigue that is the detective agency of one Mma Precious Ramotswe.  Lovely evocative writing, wonderful characters and a simple yet intriguing story.  What more does one want in a bestseller?  I was so taken with the first installment that I shall certainly be reading the entire series. 4.5 stars.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Right off the bat I have to say that the special effects in this movie were fantastic. Some of you might be familar with the older \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\"....Well some may remember that Anthony Hopkins Character in that movie was that of Van Helsing. After being a fan of Bram Stoker's Dracula and having the preconceived notion of the Van Helsing Character based on Hopkins portrayal this Van Helsing by Hugh Jackman was like the difference between night and day. To put it mildly this Van Helsing kicks monster tail!![...]
1591840562|5.0|Entrepreneurs will benefit well from reading and studying Guy Kawasaki's counseling contained in the chapters of The Art of the Start. His recommendation of not focusing on making money, but rather making meaning is akin to following a path of doing what you like and the money will follow. The focus on meaning leads entrepreneurs on a healthy odyssey that includes ultimately wealth. He implores entrepreneurs to create Version 1.0 and get it on the market rather than fussing around with making the first batch be absolutely perfect.  With the two catalysts of meaning and Version 1.0 as the driving forces, the remaining areas of positioning, pitching, planning, recruiting, raising capital, branding, and outreaching all line up to infuse positive, successful image and support (personnel, legal, financial) to make a venture, any venture, have a very strong probability of success.

B000002JOH|5.0|Out of my pantera collection, i came to the conclusion that \\"vulgar display of power\\" is my favorite pantera album and their most agressive todate. I remenber being big fans of \\"cowboys from hell\\" , \\"the great southern trend kill\\", and, \\"far beyond driven\\" but going back and listining to all those records ? \\"Vulgar display of power\\" was their most impressive effort.

0767817664|5.0|If it wasn't for my mother I would probably not have seen this classic vampire film until late in my teens. I remember sitting down with her at about the ripe age of six or so. I was extremely intrigued by every action in this film, and now at the age of 19, this film has become a truly wonderful film to watch. William Ragsdale plays the teenage detective obsessing over his next door neighbor, stating that he positively is a creature of the night. Charley Brewster (ragsdale) then goes to his tv hero, Peter Vincent ( Roddy McDowall) the great vampire killer. Peter rejects Charley's belief and later Charley is forced to go in alone. Another great aspect of this film is the sly, seductive vampire, played by Chris Sarandon. I believe he plays the perfect vamp in this tale. I honestly think that if you are in the mood to rent a hip, fun, scary, and classic vampire flick, then this is the movie. Tom Holland does an excellent job in creating the fear and clinging that an audience demands in horror films. \\"Oh, Brewster, You're so Cool\\"!
B000002H6C|5.0|Besides \\"ride the lightning\\" by metallica? I find \\"...and justice for all\\" their best second realesed album because of amazing songs like \\"one\\"  and \\"dyers ever\\" and for those songs alone? You should praise this album!
B00003CWTI|5.0|Could Tom Cruise be the greatest actor in the business right now? I would have to absolutely yes. If you are not a huge fan of Cruise, then I would most certainly suggest seeing this film. The film is based on a list of characters who are all related to each other in some way or the other, but rarely make contact. The director, Paul Thomas Anderson, creates a quickly moving film, where every character is developed thoroughly. A long movie, that dives deep into the heart of everyone who watches it. Cruise by far steps out of his comfort zone in his role as Frank TJ Mackey, and he does a superb job in capturing the character. As well as Tom, the other cast members include philip Hoffman, John Reilly, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, and Alfred Molina. Tom is my favorite actor, and when it comes to a role like this, it couldn't get any better.
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliott's final album is an undeniable masterpiece. This album stands as a testament to Elliott's genius and is a celebration of his talent. Last year, in 2003, I had the good fortune to see Elliott live at what would be his last performance ever. He didn't look well at the time and as we came to know we wasn't well. But despite that it was a pleasure to see him perform and I will forever remember seeing him. Elliott died tragically a few months later and ever since then I've waited for this album. \\"from a basement on the hill\\" is an unassuming record, an album of songs with something to say, messages worth paying attention to. Elliott had a way of singing about life, relationships and people in a unique way. He was a talented musician and his albums should be thoughtfully listened to. If you aren't familiar with Elliott's earlier releases then let this be your introduction, it is a great album to begin with.
B00005YXZH|5.0|\\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" was my first Wilco record.  Saw the CD at my local pusher's stash one day; the color tones and building vintage said to me, \\"1973.\\"  Really.  1973, the year.  When I saw the 2002 release date (I'd never heard of Wilco), I was intrigued.  I started reading reviews and thought to myself, need to buy this. <br /> <br />OK.  I now have all of Wilco's records, except \\"A Ghost Is Born\\" (gonna happen soon), and love them all.  And I have just one question for anyone who doesn't like \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" because it constitutes an incredibly radical departure from Wilco's past:  you'd heard each of their previous records, and had no idea this was coming? <br /> <br />Yes, Jeff Tweedy can still sing.  Yes, pretty much all his old bandmates left.  (Isn't Wilco really Jeff Tweedy?)  Yes, the lyrics sound pretty much like Tweedy lyrics to me.  And yes, this album is, well, if not great, at least brilliant.  (Get the difference?  \\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Let It Bleed\\":  great.  \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" and \\"Thick as a Brick\\":  brilliant.  Like <br />that.)   Tweedy is a genius, and yeah it's gonna hurt his commercial acceptance.  (Although I'd love to be \\"hurt\\" to the tune of the sales on this record and \\"A Ghost Is Born.\\")  But the man will challenge you.  Listen. <br /> <br />And one more thing.  \\"I am trying to break your heart;\\" \\"Heavy metal drummer;\\" \\"Radio cure;\\" \\"Kamera;\\" oh sure one or two others.  Brilliant.  And great. <br />
B0002Z0EXQ|5.0|When Paris of Troy (Orlando Bloom) visits Sparta, he and the lovely  Queen Helen (played by that exquisite human being Diane Kruger - whose face certainly could launch a thousand ships)elope.<br />The problem is that she is the wife of the brutal King of Sparta, Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson)<br />When he spirits Helen back with him to Troy, Menelaus vows revenge, including to tear Helen apart with his own hands. He is joined in preparing for war with Troy, by his worthless brother, Agamemnon, King of Greece, who sees an opportunity to expand his power and influence, and for plenty of plunder and riches.<br /><br />Under the leadership of Paris' father King Priam (Peter O'Toole) and his brother the heroic warrior Hector (Eric Bana), the Trojans put up a spirited and strong defense against the invading Greek armies. The champion of the Greeks is the invincible warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt), who hates Agamemnon, but his come to fight to immortalize his own name, in line with the prophecy by his seer mother.<br /><br />Brad Pitt did pull off his role as Achilles, though I was skeptical whether he would BEFORE the movie.<br />Though he was not as good as Eric Bana in his superb and thoughtful portrayal of Hector.<br />Three notable roles by three beautiful women. As already mentioned the gorgeous Diane Kruger as Helen of Troy, Saffron Burrows as Hector's regal wife Andromache, and Rose Burn as the pretty priestess, Briseis.<br /><br />The acting is superb, the setting majestic, the battle scenes brilliant.<br />I honestly don't know what the critics of this movie want. I don't think it could have been done better.<br /><br />Also this was NOT meant to be The Iliad itself, it was meant to be a realistic portrayal of the Trojan War as it might have been, and it was done superbly.<br />There was literally never a dull moment in the whole movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie -- anything but a work of art. It displays the low-down, distorted scandals of the Bush administration; from the rigged elections to the oh-so amusing unintelligence of what Bush portrays. <br /> <br />     There's no sense in writing a review -- that is, my opinion shouldn't influence yours. Ignore the Pro/Anti Bush reviewers on Amazon, see it for yourself, and make your judgement, as any 'free' American should.
B00005JNEI|1.0|...Every Islamic terrorist organization in the world has come out and not only openly endorsed this movie, but have publicly stated that they would do their best to help Michael Moore get this movie shown in as many countries as possible.  Do you honestly need to know anything more than that?  If so, then you're a bigger genetic misfire than Michael Moore is, because even HE knows this.  You can look this up on both CNN and Fox News web sites.  He continually AIDS AND COMFORTS THE ENEMY with this movie and his speeches.  This stupid, fat white man is laughing all the way to the bank.  Not only is this sedition, but U.S. Constitution Article 3, Section 3 defines his propaganda as \\"treason\\".
0060987464|5.0|This became one of my favorite books I have ever read. THe story not only intrigued me but was very well written. I couldn't put the book down from the time I began reading it. I went back many times to re-read sertain parts. Many things that the band did were amazing but to see how Manson came out of the situation was kind of inspirational. I have new respect to him and will never forget this book. It was such a great read.
B0000AI44Q|2.0|I admire the scope and amount of work he put into the multimedia aspect of this project, but this music is just plain dull.  All of the songs sound the same and barely have coherent melodies.  If you really want to subject yourself to Greendale, you might as well watch the DVD or go see it live, at least there's more going on to hold your attention.  The second star of the two stars I gave this was for sheer effort.
068987474X|4.0|This book is for entertainment purposes and isn't trying to revolutionize dating so if you take it too seriously or look at it from a die-hard feminist perspective, it's going to be lost on you. <br />But if you're looking for a 'funny cos it's true' take on dating rules for women, this is the perfect opportunity to sharpen your skills. <br />The only thing I didn't like about the book is that it didn't acknowledge that some men have a hard time expressing their feelings.  This is a general sociological fact, and if a man you're in a relationship with isn't constantly pawing you, complimenting you, calling you every five minutes, sending flowers, being thoughtful, etc., it doesn't necessarily mean he's not that into you, it means he's either A. not that into you, OR B. is taking you for granted and being lazy and in serious need of an attitude adjustment, or C. is a man and sometimes hears a voice in the back of his mind that says, \\"I've been burned so I'd better not show TOO much interest because the girl I love might not be that into me.\\"  Men get insecure and play hard to get too, Greg.  They know women go for the bad boy, not the guy that always remembers to call, so they play games too.  Don't forget that.
B0002O06N0|4.0|This album is far tighter than their previous recording, which sounded like a looser version of the White Stripes with 1969 vocals.  Well, the retro vocals are still here, but the songs are more straight up rock and roll than mopey blues.  Great use of stereo here as well, with riffs changing emphasis based on the use of levels.  Simple, intelligent and immensely enjoyable.
0790734850|5.0|Amazon Reviewer Dennis Littrell (SoCal) (scroll down to read his review) - called L.A. Confidential  &#62;&#62;&#62; a &#34;guy thing,&#34;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;, and hey, I am a woman, for sure ;-)and I like it too.... <br /> <br />I enjoyed this terrifically noir tale tremendously. Of course Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes is smooth, solid, and believable (I think I am falling in love with his craggy face), and same goes for Russell Crow. And yes the story is a la Chinatown, focuses on crime and corruption, neon-tainted glamour and &#34;moral disillusionment as only the City of Angels could play it.&#34;  <br /> <br />Ah, but in the end, there is heaven's justice, meted out by men! Yes, this one is one helluva feel-good movie, recommended to all couch-potatoes along with Diet Coke, hot-buttered popcorn, and a sweetheart to cuddle up to. And if you don't have the sweetheart ... have faith in that you will, one day soon.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|Classic Trek Season Two is indeed a worthy successer to Season One.The Show by now had grown and the characters were fully drawn.This season not only had some of the best episodes of the franchise but also some of the most importent.Among these were \\"Amok Time\\" and \\"Journey to Babel\\" both of which explored the curious Vulcan mystique. <br />     The great thing about Star Trek has always been that in the midst of all the technology they never forgot that intelligent beings always had to have the upper hand.These dangers were explored in \\"The Ultimate Computer\\"(one of my personal favorites with the late,great William Marshall)and (albeit by accident)\\"The Changling\\".Man's self-destuctive nature was examined in \\"The Doomsday Machine\\".The lesson that he should not be so quick to think his ancestry irrelevent was noted in \\"Who Mourns for Adonis?\\"The true meaning of paradise was explored in \\"The Apple\\". <br />     Then ,of course,there's \\"Mirror,Mirror\\",one of the three or four best episodes of the series. <br />     The series also exhibited it's sense of humor with fun episodes like \\"I,Mudd\\",\\"A Piece of the Action\\"and of course the classic \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". <br />     While there were a few bad apples(\\"The Omega Glory\\",\\"Bread&Circuses\\"{both enjoyable but silly},and Catspaw{boring})The series had clearly maintained(and in some cases surpessed)the greatness of Season One.

However, half of the songs are preludes or interludes with spoken words & sound affects to help the progression of the album's theme. These pieces are very important for they set the mood and feel of the ambience of the songs. Think about like when your watching an epic movie and how  the music build up to an upcoming scene.       Wow had never heard of Blind Guardian before till an associate hand given me this cd and man am I glad he did. This cd blew my brains out!  Have never ever heard anything like this before. NEVER! When you hear this album you automatically understand why they are a POWER METAL band. Felt as if I was in another time and place. Metal in a  time of wizards, sorcerers, dragons etc. Think of Lord of The Rings and metal and you will have an idea of the ambience of this album. Actually this album is based on a story by the author of The Lord of The Rings. This album is simply a marvelous beautiful power rock cd. Highly recommended album to anyone that is curious about how powerful a POWER METAL band can be.       Just love the way these musicians had all these epic sounds of music from another time felt like really was in another time. For instance song #4 had beautiful guitars(with hints of celtic music, classical, and folk) and made me think that if Metal and electric guitars were around in that time period then maybe this is how metal might have sounded back then. Un-believable! Come to think of it back then Knights were kinda like guitar heros that were worshipped like gods so that really intrigued me. Makes you think.     From start to finish this album is just mind boggling. Nothing like it out there and is a must for Power Metal fans. Great production, great lyrics, great guitars, great drums, and one hell of an album. Tell you what if you do not like this album then you will most likely not like POWER METAL. Check it out!      GO BUY, BORROW, BEG, OR STEAL THIS ALBUM! CHEERS MATE! CHEERS!      COKE08  (...)    ---------------------------------------------------------------
068987474X|3.0|This is good and easy reading, but I must recommend the book \\"Stop Getting Dumped\\" as further reading material regarding this subject.   Enjoy:)
B000006045|5.0|In 'Mezzanine', Massive Attack main-man Robert Del Naja has summoned from the dark abyss an extraordinary record, best served in the safety of your own home with all doors and windows safely locked.  <br />There ought to be an advisory sticker warning against playing this on your Walkman while walking down dark alleys. Edgy, brooding, menacing - this is sonic murk of the highest calibre.  <br />Opening song `Angel' would have been used by Hitchcock had he re-made Psycho in a Blade Runner setting. Prowling, phased drums and a hypnotic bass line build to an eruption of distorted guitar chords and a disturbing vocal delvery.  <br />Defining moments come aplenty. A minute into 'Teardrop', Liz Frazer's haunting vocal shudders into life against a crystal-clear heartbeat and instrumentation designed for atmosphere over and above any dance floor ambitions.  <br />Chilled-out? Frazer's vocal delivery is as blissful and mesmerising as anything she has done during or after her Cocteau Twins career. The effect knocks `Song to the Siren' into the same cocked hat that Neil Davidge threw out with the rubbish when he began producing this album. <br />`Inertia Creeps' bursts to life with the type of Byzantine chaos that litters Peter Gabriel albums. Here, as with the band's groundbreaking `Blue Lines' album, hip-hop vocal influences sneak through, but on Mezzanine the words are whispered rather than blasted through a megaphone. Goth-hop anyone? <br />Throughout the production, bass lines register on a level that never leaves the pit of your stomach. Intelligently crafted drum and synthesizer loops augment rather than overpower the songs. <br />This album was voted number 15 in Q magazine's list of 100 all-time best British albums. The Prodigy's `Fat of the Land' only made 47. It's not hard to see why this dark, brooding, monster of an album is considered so highly by critics. It's a work of true genius.     <br />
6305278016|3.0|I finally saw this movie yesterday, 15 years after it was released. I had read \\"Rising Sun\\" and have watched the movie version of it, and was interested in Japanese culture and the perception of the Japanese back in the late 80's and early 90's. So I ordered \\"Black Rain\\" and though it also addresses Japanese-American cultural differences, has plenty of action and is stylistic, it was kind of a letdown. The movie didn't seem to pick up until Andy Garcia's character got his head lopped off (perhaps not such a bad thing), which was an hour into it. After that I enjoyed it quite a bit, but unfortunately my impression of \\"Black Rain\\" is not much more than a semi-cheesy 80's buddy cop movie, of which there are so many already. If it's buddy cop flicks you like, \\"Rising Sun\\" is a far better movie dealing with similar themes and cultural perspectives. If you are interested in these things, then the book by Michael Crichton is even better. Plus, it was a bit difficult for me to be convinced of Michael Douglas's tough-cop role in \\"Black Rain\\" with that hideous perm he's sporting. Overall, a good movie but there are certainly better ones which are just as entertaining, stylistic, educational, and sexy.
B00003CXCT|5.0|\\"A Long Time Ago, In A Galaxy Far Far Away...\\" <br />I'm sorry about the title; I'm sure that half the reviews already share the name, and many more to come will use it too.  However, it works very well so I'm going to stick with it.  Anyway, this review is not going to be like most of the reviews that I do in the sense that I'm not going to focus on reviewing the films themselves (I think that you can find my reviews on the individual films, but I'm not sure).  I'm going to focus on the release itself and the technical aspects and the extras. <br />\\"This will be a day long remembered.\\" -Darth Vader <br />So we finally have the original Star Wars trilogy on DVD.  This is something that people have been waiting for ever since the DVD format was introduced, and now that we have it, is it worth it?  Do you even need to ask?!  These movies have the distinction of being a cultural phenomenon, something that few films ever achieve.  At most, there is one film/set of films per generation that achieves this level of popularity (Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy is currently the best contendor for our generation's phenomenon).  They were a smash hit back in 1977, 1981, and 1983 (I think those dates are correct), and they were also technological marvels.  The stories have withstood the test of time like few movies can, and while the special effects are beyond outdated (watch these films after watching one of the new ones), it does not matter at all, because even though the effects are important in this movie, we will always love them no matter how outdated they look.  Speaking of the new trilogy, I must say that while I really liked Attack of the Clones (and can't wait for Revenge of the Sith), and marginally enjoyed Phantom Menace, these movies are far superior despite the advances in technology that abound in the prequel trilogy.  Also, I look at these movies differently now that the prequels are out.  Before, when I'd watch these, I knew that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hammil), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) were the main characters and Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) was the villain.  Now, I see Vader as the main character (despite being the antagonist) and the rebels, while they are important characters, are not the focus of the film.  The two trilogies are best put as the rise, fall, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd/Hayden Chritenson/David Prowse/James Earl Jones/Sebastian Shaw). <br />\\"You've never heard of the Millenium Falcon?\\" -Han Solo <br />For the two of you who don't know the story of the trilogy (you must be living under a rock on Mars or something), basically, there is a Galactic Empire that is extremely oppressive and is run by two dark Jedi, or Sith.  There is also a Rebel Alliance, who's purpose is to overthrow the Empire and return the galaxy to a state of peace and democracy.  They are soon joined by Luke Skywalker, a farmboy who has the potential to become a Jedi, and Han Solo, a scoundrel and an amazing pilot who has a price on his head due to a botched smuggling operation. <br />\\"I can change him back.\\" -Luke Skywalker <br />As for the extras, we get great trailers and teasers all the way back from 1977!  There are multiple featurettes and documentaries, including one about the upcoming Episode III, as well as Empire of Dreams, which is apparently the most comprehensive Star Wars documentary ever made.  I have not yet watched the whole thing, but I've really liked what I've seen.  As for the changes, some of them are good, some are not.  I am going to say this right now: THESE ARE GEORGE LUCAS' MOVIES, AND HE CAN CHANGE THEM IF HE WANTS TO!  Having said that, there are some things that I don't like.  The added some stuff for humor, but it really fell flat most of the time (like when Luke, Obi-Wan (Alec Guiness), C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels), and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) go to Mos Eisly in A New Hope).  Also, I understand why George Lucas changed the Han/Greedo scene.He wanted Solo to be a reformed scoundrel, not reformed murderer, so that's why Han no longer shoots first.  However, Han's dodge looks so awful, I wish it had been left as it was.  Other non-storyline changes mostly involve music in Return of the Jedi, which, while I like the old music, it does not take away from the story.  My favorite change would be the addition of Ian McDiarmod as the Emporor in Empire Strikes Back.  McDiarmod was always in RotJ, PM, and AotC, so it fit for continuity, and the original emporor in ESB was just bad.  They also overdubbed Boba Fett's lines with Temuera Morrison, who played Jango Fett in AotC.  The story is that Boba is a clone of Jango, so it makes sense for continuity.  Even though I am in favor of this for continuity reasons, I think that Jeremy Bulloch, the original Boba Fett, sounded more menacing.  The other continuity change is that, instead of Sebastian Shaw playing Anakin's ghost, now we have Hayden Chritenson.  I also liked this solely for continuity reasons.  All other changes from the special edition are still here. <br />\\"She was very beautiful.\\" -Leia Organa <br />I am now referring to the picture and sound.  Star Wars has never looked or sounded better (with maybe a few exceptions here and there).  THX did a great job cleaning everything up.  There were a few places that could have been better, but the film is very old and worn, so it doesn't get much better than this. <br />\\"The force will be with you.  Always.\\" -Obi-Wan Kenobi <br />In conclusion, this DVD set is definitely a welcome addition to anyone's collection, whether they are a die-hard fan or someone watching the films for the first time.
068987474X|5.0|A lot of the same basic ideas presented in the book The Rules a few years back, but told in a hilarious conversational style, and from a male perspective.  Very down-to-earth, matter-of-fact presentation. Amusing and entertaining. I've bought a few copies to give to friends who just don't seem to get it, no matter how often you try to explain when they come crying to you yet again because their life / relationship is going nowhere.    I've seen too many men who were taking it slow with one woman, somehow speed up swiftly to marry another.  I've seen wonderful women moping around night after night by the phone waiting anxiously for a call from a guy who promised to call, while that same guy was out on a date with someone else.     It's terrible to watch others stuck in a hopeless cycle of constant excuses and implausible scenarios about a man that everyone else can see is not overly interested. At least not interested enough to commit. It is not virtuous to forgive just about anything from a man, in fact it's pitiful, and to be honest it's the beginning of what could become an abusive situation. If we don't think our situation is all that bad, try and look at it as an outsider. What would we say if someone else was in this same situation.    Like the book points out, nothing ever comes from deluding ourselves, so accept that things really might be as simple as they appear and get on with your life.  Great book for men and women. Easy to read and understand. Gave a copy to a teenager who saw herself falling into these traps.
B0000542D2|3.0|I was looking forward to the release of one of my favorite films on DVD. I expected the picture and sound to be as I remembered them when I saw the film in the theater in 1964. Somebody just dubbed a video of the film onto DVD apparently with no remixing, or remastering. The soundtrack is at times inaudible, both dialog and songs. It was difficult enough to understand the Beatles' accents at times, and this version of a 40-year old film does nothing to clarify it. The included \\"Bonus Disk\\" would not play on my DVD player, so I have no idea what it contains. Still, it's a great movie, and nobody can take that away. The best Rock 'N Roll film ever made!
B0002S94OS|2.0|Okay, okay.the guy below this is right and wrong.   <br /> <br />This album is NOT that great. and it is mediocre.  He is also right that Shadows Fall's The WAr Within is better.  BUT I strongly(X10) disagree with his statement of the other bands Godforbid,Killswitch engage,Unearth.  Godforbid does suck.... BUT Killswitch Engage and Unearth deserves mass praise for their latest albums.......I own both and think that both are amazing.   <br /> <br />Comparing this album to either Shadows Fall's, KSE's or Unearth's latest is like comparing a bike to a car......this album is simple and not really that impressive whereas the others are.   <br /> <br />I urge anyone thats looking into buying this album, instead to buy either  Shadows Fall's, KSE's or Unearth's latest because.....they are 10000000000 times better and totally worth your money
0393035158|5.0|As a (retired) Presbyterian minister, I felt this to be a must read book for people of faith.  It's not an easy read...intellectually or spiritually.  In fact, painful.  But oh, so necessary...and enlightening.  It's about time someone had the audacity to prod us people of faith to see the serious implication of traditional \\"faith thinking.\\"  Don Williamson
B000002I8D|5.0|Trust me, if you're going through a divorce, this record will give you the comfort and solace you need.  Accept no imitations.  From the shock of finding out about an adulterous afair \\"In the Air tonight\\" to the resolution\\" This Must be Love\\" this record will be a new friend. Wonderful band, wonderful cause - an instant classic.
B00005JN0T|3.0|I watched this one with my family over the weekend and, quite frankly, had a ball.  Yeah, to some extent it's a movie with a message, but mainly it's just plain entertaining.  If you try to read too much into it, you'll miss the opportunity for a good old-fashioned sci fi romp.<br /><br />Fast forward to the year 2035.  The monolithic company \\"U.S. Robotics\\" has put NS-4 domestic assistant robots into mass production, so much so that they are commonplace \\"members\\" of American society.  Their artificial intelligence is designed to be as much like humans as possible, but is regulated by the \\"3 laws\\" programming that is hardwired into every robot.  These laws are:  1. To protect human life above all; 2. To obey human commands except if it would violate law 1; and 3. To protect its own existence unless doing so would violate laws 1 or 2.  The laws seem a foolproof way to ensure that the robots would never pose a threat to humanity.  But all that changed when the man billed as the father of robotic technology and the 3 laws turns up dead in a very public, and very suspicous, manner, just as the new and improved NS-5 model is about to flood the market.  The death is quickly written off by all concerned as a suicide.  All except detective Dale Spooner, this is.<br /><br />Being a good cop and a sharp detective, Spooner (played by Will Smith) in not content that the professor's death was a suicide, and begins investigating with the lead suspect, an NS-5 robot named \\"Sonny\\".  Sonny's intelligence is so advanced, and his \\"emotions\\" so well simulated, that he appears to have something resembling a human soul.  Spooner believes that Sonny killed the professor, and sets out to prove it.  His (over)zealous approach to the task, coupled with his deep distrust of robots and their manufacturer, quickly lands him in hot water with some powerful people.  Some difficult and destructive encounters with the metallic menaces leave him looking like an obsessive paranoiac, and ultimately result in his suspension from the police force.<br /><br />Spooner continues his chase nonetheless, following a series of clues left by the dead professor, as step by step the mystery begins the unwind.  All along the way are some great action sequences, plot twists and one-liners.  However, except for Will Smith's character (which is the same as it has been in every film he has done since \\"Men in Black\\"), nothing about the story is predictable.  When the final shoe drops, most viewers will be pleasantly surprised by the unexpected ending.<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a wild ride with lots of great sci fi treats and effects.  The only downsides were the lack of character development on any signficant level -- this is a purely plot-driven movie -- and the fact that Will Smith essentially played himself, much as he always does.  Still, it's worth seeing.  I certainly don't regret the investment of two hours.spension from the police force.

B0002VL0KQ|3.0|Not a lot of people can relate to this album. Celine as mature over her music and now that she is a mom, she concentrate on her child not because she feels the need to but because that's what it's her heart. My music teacher always told me that you will always play music that helps you escape or express your life depending on the circumstances, and right now celine his expressing her happiness. But she still stands
B00007BK2N|5.0|This is a great film. Very tounge in cheek with a great performance by Steve Coogan. It's not so much the story of Factory records as a ramble through the strange characters that made-up the Manchester music scene of the time. From reading the other reviewers it seems clear that this is a British film written for British audiences. It's not a fans film about the bands or the misuc, but an ironic view on how the music emerged form such a shambles. Very funny.
B00020X88O|4.0|Nobody would ever mistake \\"Showgirls\\" for \\"Gone With the Wind.\\"  It is by all rights the best little worst movie ever made.  Bad acting, bad script, poor direction, mixed with silly but lavish production numbers, a great deal of nudity, simulated sex acts, and foul language make this film fun to watch.  Liz Berkley literally shed her good girl image in just 3 minutes of screen time.  I knew from the get go this was a cult movie from the start.  Now, we have a VIP Edition, complete with pastys, shot glasses, and deck (or should I say dick) cards.  No true collector of cult movies, or collectors sets can not own this movie.  A guilty pleasure.
B000002MJR|5.0|If you find a better live CD than this, please let me know! The live recording brings Dire Straits' music to life. Calling Elvis and Heavy Fuel are OK on the On Every Street CD, but they are pure hard rockers here. Paul Franklin's pedal steel adds a lot to the album, particularly on Walk Of Life. Romeo And Juliet is back, a much better version than their first Live CD set. Even the songs that are played much like the originals have more immediacy. Oddly enough, the least satisfying cut is Money For Nothing, the \\"anthem\\". Perhaps they've simply played it too much. (I've certainly heard it too much!) When the album ends with Brothers In Arms, you'll simply let it start playing all over again. This is one of the very few CDs that I never get tired of. This is a masterful, powerful album, great musicianship, music that makes you listen. You may find the vocals muddy on occasion, and the crowd noise is prominent (which I happen to like), but the crowd noise is used to blend the entire CD into one seamless performance, with no fades. All live albums should do this. Enjoy!
B000066NW0|5.0|I,m with you is the best song of all time
1878424777|4.0|I would recommend this book to people that are starting to look for something to change their lives. The book is repetive but like I said it is a place to start to change your life. Many reviews here are pretty positive but the negatives ones I would say are over dramatic. This book is meant as a starting point to change your life not to be as an advanced book.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|The first good thing about the movie was, naturally, Hugh Jackman. Unfortunately, his normally excellent acting skills were wasted on this particular film. It's not as if I even had high expectations for this movie (which often leads to some measure of disappointment) but it failed to hit even my mediocre expectations. In fact, I would have rated it lower than three stars if it hadn't been for the bloopers as a bonus feature. Make no mistake, the movie had potential -- it just didn't live up to it.  Not only was Hugh Jackman's talent woefully unexplored, the filmmakers seemed far more interested in moving the picture at a frenetic pace than actually investing ANY effort or time on character development. Yes, it has action and plenty of it but without that emotional investment that fully developed characters evoke, the action is merely chaotic motion without meaning or impact. I was actually yawning during parts where I should have been on the edge of my seat. Creature designs had some interesting work (except the less-than-spectacular werewolf designs) but there was so much reliance on (decent but far from exceptional) CGI that they rarely ever seemed to be in the same movie as the material characters. Many green screen shots were unconvincing and the motion control in relation to the green screen shots was shaky enough to be distracting at times. The script was uninspired, the plot had very little flesh to it and, as I said, the characters were hollow. Perhaps a little more money (or less effort to over-reach a limited budget), a LOT more (any!) effort on character development, and some tweaking of plot and dialogue could have made this movie a fun outing.  As it stands, the best points that could be said for the movie was Hugh Jackman in long hair (very nice) and the bloopers which were sometimes laugh-out-loud funny after watching the dismal movie. The bloopers gave more humanity to the DVD than the entire picture and the humility of them made me far more forgiving than I originally felt watching this movie. \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" was a far better, richer picture than \\"Van Helsing\\" even with Keanu Reeves' typically flat acting and Winona Ryder's flinching when she was supposed to be dead. In Van Helsing's defense, it WAS a PG-13 (therefore very restricted) and B.S's Dracula was R rated but I've seen G rated movies with more depth and development than this one. 'Tis a shame but at least it's not completely unwatchable.
0684800713|4.0|This is the work that made Hemingway known to the world. It is his best piece of longer fiction. His best work is his stories. When he goes on too much he gets to the bull, and the bull is often too much bull for what he really has to say.<br /><br />This is too the quintessential Hemingway. Jake Barnes is the wounded Hemingway hero who must act with the silence and dignity and not show his feelings'.He must not be  like  the Jewish Robert Cohn middleweight boxing champion of Princeton(Hemingway here displays the polite Anti- Semitism so common to his class in that time. Fitzgerald does the same in Meyer Wolfsheim world series scene in 'Gatsby')  who cries and is sentimental, and thus violates the Hemingway code. \\"Grace under pressure\\" means admiring the bullighter who under pressure acts with the grace of minimum motion .It means for the code hero Barnes living his life with the same kind of emotional economy that the model bullfighter, sports hero , simple man of action does.<br /><br />The whole Hemingway myth of heroism is in this work  including the beautiful aristocratic  rich bitch Brett Ashley whose impossible love with Barnes is the ' romantic story heart ' of the work.<br /><br />My generation was raised to think of the Hemingway-twenties expatriate people as heroic forebearers. They seem to me now in the distance of time spoiled party-goers redeemed only by the masterful prose and perception of their creator. Hemingway read the Bible and out of it made a simple style of conjunctions. He made out of it a way of seeing and describing all his own. In doing this he did what most writers hope to do, and only a few can.<br /><br />Hem could really write, and he could really describe with a kind of poetic intensity the details of the world he was perceiving. Despite my great admiration for the Nick Adams' stories, and my sympathy for the ' wounded Hemingway hero ' and my love of a number of other great Hemingway stories I simply find the ' myth ' and the Hemingway hero , an artificial construction contradicted not only by the author's famous boasting and bragging within the work and without, but by the much more complex world of living real characters American expatriate, or not.ficial construction contradicted not only by the author's famous boasting and bragging within the work and without, but by the much more complex world of living real characters American expatriate, or not.
B000002H1T|2.0|I remember it like yesterday. I had been a big Cars fan throughout their career, and I had a friend who, at the time, was working on the mastering of this recording before it was release. He had been raving about it for weeks. He built it up as their best recording ever and brought back an advance mixdown for me to hear. I'll never forget how disappointed I was. <br /> <br />The Cars already had a very poppy, commercial sound, but they also had originality and a charming quirkiness to them that made them endearing. Their success up to Heartbeat City seemed like a natural result of a band that had not sacrificed their integrity to make it. They already had a natural formula for success, but with Heartbeat City they appeared to deliberately attempt to make their sound even more slick, polished, and commercial. The result is an over-produced, conventional (for the time), disposable pop album that has not aged well at all. With a few exceptions, notably \\"You Might Think\\" and \\"Hello Again\\", the quirkiness is drowned out under a wash of reverb and overly bright EQ. True, there's no doubt this release helped The Cars reach their highest level of commercial success with no less than 4 hits, (the videos at the time certainly helped put these songs across) but it's a an obvious sellout and a fairly soulless release.  <br /> <br />
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I saw Shrek on video yesterday. I'm unaware of the general consensus about it, so termr like overrated or underrated can't really apply with me with that in mind. <br /> <br />I sat down to watch it in a bad mood. To be honest  I was wanting to hate the damn stupid kiddie movie, but ten minutes in the first smile appeared on my face and I looked forward to more. By the end I had laughed out loud a few times, tapped my toes to the music and actually read the title credits. My bad mood had been dispelled and was replaced by that most emabrassing of thing sto admit, a \\"feel good\\" factor. Yes, Shrek had cheered me up!  <br /> <br />Okay it's not really a kid's movie I agree. Body functions and mild sexual innuendo are the main gripes. But unless you're a diehard Puritan I don't think it's that big a deal. Let your kids see if they want, that's my view.  None of the PG rated elements are going to  make much of an impact on them in my opinion. <br /> <br />There are a few problems. The Donkey is amusing the first 5 minutes, but there's is simply too much of him. You can actually feel Shreks annoyance at thim. Which isn't really something the audience should have to bear though! The plot is thin to say the least. (And to Americans who complain about the \\"annoying\\" accents- have you heard yourself talk?:P ) And it's too short! <br /> <br />But forget all that. Shrek is good escapist fun. People who find it cynical are being...well...cynical! Ireverent? You bet.  But anything sinsiter lurking within it's frames is a figment of your imagination. I find the CG images astonishing, and it's a movies that you can watch many times just to savour the images and see what subtleties you missed the first time around.  Although in theory CG animation is not much more than a deluxe cartoon animation, the fascination is that soemthing as clinical and soulless as a computer can produce something so full of life and character. And whether it's the Gingerbread man saying \\"eat me!\\" to seeingSnow White disco dancing with one of the Three bears, to the princess being subjected to a song and dance routine by Robin Hood and his Merry Men and saying \\"man, that was annoying!\\" fun is poked at fairy tale cliches. Yet it's always done good naturedly. <br /> <br /> <br />Flatulent ogres, belching princesses, crass humour ,thinly veiled statement on the state of America or what, or whatever criticisms, I DON'T CARE! As a piece of good old fashioned feel good entertainment Shrek is a winner. The finale of the the entire cast dancing to The Monkees I'm A Believer should make everyone laugh.And you know what? I'm ordering the DVD version through Amazon. Maybe these reviews do have a use!
6304428928|5.0|i don't know what happened in the 80's, but hollywood seemed to fall into a black hole, producing one bad film after another. rain man is one of the exceptions. it has a good story told w/o too much of the schmaltz hollywood usually likes to pile onto feel-good films. unlike many people, i wasn't entirely convinced by hoffman's character. to me, he just looked like he was acting. i wouldn't  have given him the oscar for that performance. cruise, otoh, was very convincing, first as the hot-shot, emotionally-distant, embittered young man, then later as the younger brother with a heart. i was impressed by the transformation. the scenes at the end - the meeting with the doctors and the goodbye at the station - were especially touching. cruise really showed here that he could act. and i'm not a tom cruise fan. but i was genuinely impressed.<br />so, the film that started the stampede to films about emotionally disabled people still holds up well. highly recommended.
B000001E21|5.0|I got this album just 6 years ago on cassette while in South Korea. I then got it on cd because I deemed it worthy! Most of these songs are good enough to be on any Lep album. They are much better than anything after Pyromania, although Euphoria has some good tunes. Ring of Fire and Desert Song (great lead) kick ass! Action (Sweet) and She's Too Tough (covered by Helix) rock too. Miss You In A Heartbeat is a good ballad while From The Inside talks about alcoholism (Steve Clark). After Dark is a catchy song. I'm glad to see this album getting good reviews. It's the best thing they put out after Pyromania!
0316096199|5.0|Annotation: \\"lucky\\" is a memoir about Alice Sebold. It is an amazing story about her experience with rape, and her recovery. An average girl, and a late night walk in the park changed her life. Her life at school, at home, with her friends, and with her family all alter into a world she never dreamed of. The rape is with her every second of every day, and it comes before her harder than ever when she spots her rapist on the street. Her next step was to make him pay. To make him suffer and feel the horror she has gone through. She lives life now differently, and she learns different lessons.  <br /> <br />Author Bio: Alice Sebold is also the author of the bestseller \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" She was born in Madison, Wisconsin. Her family moved to the suburbs of Philadelphia when she was very young, and that is where she grew up. She was a student at Syracuse University and the University of Houston, and later in her 30's for an MFA from UC Irvine. Alice Sebold has been teaching and lecturing since 1984. <br /> <br />Evaluation: Alice Sebold is an amazing author, and this Memoir was nothing short of amazing. I was captured from the first sentence to last. She shines through, making you never stop reading. Her words are insightful, and I have learned a lot from her. As described by other readers, a role model for anyone. This is a book that anyone and everyone should read, a perfect edition to any collection. She has grown from her tragic experience and has become a stronger person. From this, I too have learned to look at things differently, under a new light. <br />
B000001DVD|5.0|This album was produced by Mutt Lange (Shania Twain's husband) just after he produced the awesome Back In Black by AC/DC. The sound is very raw and stripped-down, centered around the guitar riff. I discovered this album because a show in Broomfield, Colorado called Teletunes used to play the videos for Let It Go, Bringing On The Heartbreak, and High n Dry. That was before MTV became huge. This album is rock solid and contains other classics like Mirror Mirror (hypnotizing), Lady Strange (cool solo), Switch 625 (builds nicely), and Hit and Run. The only song I could do without is No No No. You should also have Pyromania, On Through The Night (mediocre production though), and Retro Active (has some great unreleased songs from the 80s). \\"Get ready for the big C!\\"
B00001QEFU|5.0|Well, I haven't heard the original mix of this album. The first time I heard it was when the band re-release it on 1985 (I guess), and they already had included \\"I'll Never Grow Up Now\\", so, I cannot really tell anything wrong about the production. Hopefully, I'll hear it someday.<br /><br />This is a very different approach of what TWISTED SISTER became a few years later (although the late 80's band sound it's great too).<br /><br />This is a very hard rockin' album, it has some great solos and even if they were not brilliant musicians, they really shine on this one.  The mix of heavy metal/glam/great rhythm are one of the specialties of the boys.<br /><br />One of the biggest pleasures of a great album is the beginning. If the beginning is correct, it'll keep you pumping all the way through the record.  \\"What you don't know\\" it's right up there with \\"Women\\", \\"Breaking the law\\", \\"Aces high\\", \\"Wake up the sleeping giant\\" and a bunch of others. The nice amd melodic part of the CD is for \\"Bad boys of R'N'R\\" and \\"I'll never grow up now!\\". The very hard edged songs are: THE REST OF THE ALBUM.  My personal favorite: \\"Under the blade\\".<br /><br />You can blame this guys for looking ridiculous, for being very polemic on their time, for not knowing how to handle the success after Stay Hungry and for being ugly as hell; but you have to accept that they had talent coming with good, fun and catchy songs.<br /><br />Lots of reviewers say that they are one of the best live bands ever, I couldn't tell cause I haven't seen them..............................I guess you'll have to ask me after their concert on Nov. 13. YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Highlight: Under the Blade, Bad Boys of R'N'R.<br /><br />Lowlight: Nothing.
B00000263T|5.0|This album is a little more commercial than BTTW but it still rocks hard. With classics like Metal Heart (uses two great classical melodies), Midnight Mover (great riff and solo!), Dogs On  Leads, Screaming For A love Bite, Living For Tonite, and Up To The Limit you can't go wrong for only $9.98! This is in my top 3 Accept albums, the others being Wrestless & Wild and BTTW. Get the Accept DVD if you want to see a show from the Metal Heart tour in Osaka, Japan.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Without getting into the historical and philosophical differences between the monotheistic religions and their denominations, understand that you will get out of this movie only what you put into it.  In other words, if you consider yourself a Christian, you will most likely fit into the type of audience the movie was made for and targeted at.  If you are not a Christian you will have the advantage to see the movie through a more critical lens as you will refuse to \\"suspend your disbelief.\\"<br /><br />When I first saw this movie in the theater, there was not one person in any of the rows of stadium seating around me who was not sobbing with grief.  I have never before experienced such a powerful outpouring of emotion from nearly every patron; male, female, and every race and ethnicity.  It was simply unbelievable.<br /><br />The movie is long and I actually contemplated getting up and leaving the theater because of the unrelenting nature of the flagellation and abuse that Christ had to endure.  It is that very facet, however, that pulls at the heartstrings of humanity and creates the collective sympathetic atmosphere so that the people viewing can weep and moan unabashedly together without embarassment as each one identifies with the Christ.  The DVD is good.  Allow yourself the luxury of watching the movie without distraction and see for yourself.  I rate this movie at five stars.  I personally have never seen a movie with the power to force such personal introspection as this one does.  Love it or hate it, this movie has got to be regarded as one of the cinematic classics!.
B000001DWG|4.0|This album is an unknown classic. Some of the songs are simply beautiful. The lyrics and Andrew's delivery are very moving. Songs like Bone China, Stargazer, and Man of Golden Words are classics that I will never get tired of hearing. It is such a shame that Andrew Wood passed away. He was a very unique and charismatic front man. There is not one song on the album that I feel the need to fast forward over. I give it 4.5 stars. Get it!
B000001FDQ|5.0|Rising Force is one of the few canons for shred heads. Black Star gives me shivers to this day everytime I listen to it. The sad part is that Yngwie is still stuck in the 80's. I hope he gets out soon.
B00008H2LB|1.0|That sums up this album in its entirety, boring. Linkin Park is just another terrible band that takes the recognition of the true good bands away in this country. They are basically a boy band with rapping and pathetic screams, drums and guitars. Their stuff is not good, ingenious, talented or anything else like that, it is utter crap.    For the person who said that they are the saviours of metal, you are a ignorant idiot who does not know anything about metal and, thus, should not be saying anything about it. Metal is not dead, never was and never will be, while crap like Korn, LP, and Slipknot will be.    To Paul, and any other idiot who thinks like he does, how can you say that Linkin Park are better than King Diamond and Cannibal Corpse? Is it because YOU ARE OUT OF YOU STUPID MINDS? Really, any one who thinks crap like Linkin Park is better than metal band slike Corpse and Diamond are stupid and ignorant, and know nothing about musical talent. To true metal fans, or people who want to know what good music is, stay away from this album or any other album by this band or any band like them.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|They should not have released this garbage until they wrote a script for the film! There is no substance, just one computer animated fight scene after another and a couple of gratuitous sex scenes. Total waste of time and money.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Slipknot is a band that does not get better with each album they get worse. Slipknot should not be making music, and it is astonishing that they have made 3-4 albums, let alone have a record contract.  <br /> <br />Slipknot are soft, boring and untalented music that anyone with a couple music lessons could play, and is in no way hard, technical nor difficult to play. Hell, trained monkeys could play better than Slipknot. Also, Corey Taylor is a terrible singer and needs to stop singing, because he sucks at it. Also, the fans who call themselves maggots just because Slipknot do are morons and stupid. <br /> <br />For the person who said that Slipknot is unique, are you a moron. Slipknot plays the same type of mmusic that the other nu-metal bands play, and they are not unique in the slightest and are in no way a metal band and should not be called one. <br /> <br />TO all the idiots here or anywhere else saying this is a album any true metal fan should get, let me correct that statement, \\"this album is one that true metal fans should steer clear of\\".
B00024I2Z4|4.0|OKAY I LOVE MULAN...BUT WHY DID THEY CUT OUT THE BEST LINE. AT THE END OF THE MOVIE, MULAN ASKS HER BEAU TO STAY FOR DINNER AND THE GRANDMOTHER IS HEARD OFF SCREEN SAYING \\"WOULD YOU LIKE THE STAY FOREVER\\" IT IS THE FUNNIEST LINE AND THEY CUT IT OUT WHY!(...) I HATE MICHAEL ESNER AND HIS DISNEY VAULT....THE DISNEY VAULT IS TOTALLY A CONCENTRATION CAMP FOR ALL OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES!!!!
B00008J4P5|1.0|I really had to think hard about reviewing this cd. Not because I don't like it; *that* feeling has never stopped me from writing a review before. Rather, it is the seeming inability of fans of the White Stripes to come to any other conclusion about the group other than that they are \\"musical geniuses\\" and the apparent saviors of rock. In other words, what is the point in being a dissenting voice if you're simply going to be drowned out by people who didn't want to hear your opinion in the first place? <br />  <br />But then I thought again--I thought about how wretchedly awful this cd truly is. How the record-buying masses have been duped into thinking that the Siblings White truly *are* musical geniuses who write clever, engaging songs. About how Jack White has found not only fans of his tired brand of garage-blues, but has actually become a household name and celebrity off of it. And it made me nauseous. So, off to write the one-star review I go. <br />  <br />I'll get right to the point: this is a terrible album. Pure and simple. The songwriting is below average at best--frequently dull, monotonous and recycled. The idea of garage-rock blues is nothing new, and Jack and Meg add absolutely nothing to a genre already filled to the brim with over-hyped and under-talented groups. Jack's guitar playing is mediocre, and by no means whatsoever worthy of the \\"guitar god\\" status that has inexpicably been placed on him. To place him on any kind of \\"Greatest Guitarists\\" list is an insult to everyone capable of playing more than three chords on their 6 string.  Meg's drumming is equally yawn-inducing and very rudimentary.   <br /> <br />Some people hear rawness and energy in the White Stripes--I, on the other hand, hear a lack of rhythm, talent and overall musical ability.  Those are two completely different things people. <br />  <br />So what is it, then? Why do so many people so *fervently* believe that this is legitimate boundary-pushing, genre-defining immortal music?I honestly have no idea. But the reviewer a few spots below me who noted that the White Stripes fan base is comprised primarily of Urban Outfitters shoppers looking for t-shirts with witty slogans was dead on. The White Stripes are defined as being \\"cool\\", so you must like them. Someone sitting high up in one of the record company towers had a brainstorm one afternoon, and decided that the pop world was in need of a band with a shred of indie cred to appeal to the Britney-Christina age group. And lo, the White Stripes fit the bill. So here we are. <br />  <br />None of this would matter one iota, really, if it weren't for the fact that a multitude of truly outstanding, talented bands are existing below the radar while these clowns are playing on TRL. But that's how it always has been in music, I suppose, and it's naive to think that anything would change now. <br />  <br />I imagine, in the end, my criticisms will fall on deaf ears, much like others on here. And fans of the Stripes will go on as before, blissfully ignorant to the fact that their rock saviors are little more than corporate cash cows, promoted with a programmed image designed to rake in the $$$. But, hey, if that's what it takes to stay with the \\"in\\" crowd, then I guess it doesn't matter.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Yes, this is yet another summer blockbuster disaster flick with an earth-shaking score and some rather amazing visual effects.  This film is director/writer/producer Roland Emmerich's baby, and he does give the film some lavish attention to production.  The story isn't too bad, even if it is absolutely unbelievable that the events that unfold happen all at once.  Roland Emmerich, who's best film is still \\"Stargate,\\" but is mostly remembered for his mega-plex phenomenon, \\"Independence Day,\\" very nearly gets extra bases for \\"The Day After Tomorrow.\\"  However, the acting is wooden; the characters, two-dimensional.  I could actually see myself watching this film again someday on a rainy afternoon, too feverish to care about acting or the story's plausibility; just soaking up the dazzling special effects and trying to ignore the rest.  This is not a bad film, but it will be forgotten by next season.
B00008H2LB|5.0|While I can understand someone not liking Meteora, which I happen to own and think is a great cd, I cannot for the life of me understand some of these ignorant \\"music\\" fans. That one idiot who is still bringing up the names of King Diamond, Testament, Cannibal Corpse?? Are you kidding me? You call Cannibal Corpse a good band? Maybe if you like killing kittens and puppies, have never had a girlfriend, think it's cool to dress in black from head to toe, and hate your parents it would be a good band. Maybe you should learn about music before you comment on it, \\"THEMETALBEAST\\". While no band today or tomorrow will likely compete with older Metallica, the fact that you trash Meteora but brag about King Diamond and Cannibal Corpse, along with the rest of those amazingly sad excuses for musicians just proves that you have no idea what music is MetalBeast!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|The Straight:  Unless you have the mentality of a seven-year-old going in...this movie is a big, noisy, expensive pile of festering rubbish.  Sure, there's a story...but it only pops up between flashes of CGI and a bombastic score.  For that matter, the special effects are very average, at best; horrible, at their worst.  There were also frequent moments during the film that conjured up images of an even worse film, \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\\"  I was distracted enough by the excruciatingly beautiful Kate Beckinsale to make it to the end of the film.  But the plotting is piece-meal and erroneous, taking a backseat to the pretty lights, fast camera shots, and Kate's gorgeous eyes.  The main characters should've died numerous times during the film.  They are not X-Men, after all.  When one of them does expire it happens in a manner that is feeble compared to what was endured earlier.  Having \\"Frankenstein's Monster\\" wax intellectual was also extremely ridiculous.  This film is nonsense, even for a fantasy yarn. <br /> <br />The Narrow(or how to make it to the end of this film):  Get a labotomy.  Go in thinking this movie is going to be incredibly dumb and it might elevate itself to mediocrity.  If Kate Beckinsale hadn't been in this movie, I would've thrown unspeakable, rotting things at the screen.  Try very hard to suspend your disbelief...if you can.
0140177396|5.0|I have read Mice and Men many times, and each time the meaning becomes a level deeper. This book is a social drama filled with moral conflict that tests societal attitudes and the barriers society establishes between the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The American dream, so easily attained by some, will never be achieved by most, and the rules lived by are sometimes broken for reasons society does not accept (evident in the ending).<br /><br />The plot is very simple, two unlikely misfits become friends, George who dreams of a place to call his own and Lennie, a powerful simple minded giant, subject to delusions. Lennie is like a child and George assumes responsibility for him as they travel doing migrant work. In the course of their travels, they meet representative members of society, those accepted and those not and although Lennie and George try to mind their own business, Lennie commits a terrible 'crime' and George must 'help' his child like friend the only way he knows how.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the details, but the story ends in a moral dilema. Powerful book for literary discussions, social lessons as well as moral discussion---and wonderful to read.
B00005QG9J|5.0|\\"True\\" Incubus fans always bash this album. They say they \\"sold out\\". Well, they probably wouldn't be the great band they are today if they never \\"sold out\\". They'd still be messing around with their lame electronic crap instead of making intellegent, thoughtful songs like the ones on Morning View and A Crow Left of the Murder. If you look at Fungus Amongus and S.C.I.E.N.C.E., they both suck terribly. Call me a poser, but this is my favorite Incubus album for many reasons. <br />1: 11 out of the 13 songs on this are great! One of the non great songs is still OK. <br />2: Great lyics! IMO, the lyrics on ACLOTM are WAY better, yet these are better than Make Yourself's and whatnot. Better than singing about a certain shade of green with a crappy background riff. <br />3: Catchy and stuff. Everytime a hear one of these songs I start to sing right away. <br />Ok well, yeah here are the songs and stuff. <br />1.Nice to Know You - Not the greatest intro in the world but an awesome song. <br />2.Circles - Heaviest song here, rules even though its not really that heavy. <br />3.Wish You Were Here - An enigmatic display of poeticy and acoustic....ness....or something. <br />4.Just a Phase - An acid ride through great acoustic riffs and static sounds. <br />5. 11AM - My favorite song on the album. Lets just leave it there. <br />6. Blood on the Ground - An OK song, I always skip it. <br />7. Mexico - Rules. Great tale about.... stuff. <br />8. Warning - Cool song. Cool lyrics. Cool Video. <br />9. Echo - Rules. Let's just leave it a that. <br />10. Have You Ever - Have you ever tried to... skip this song? You can't. It's too good. <br />11. Are You In? - Now this one you CAN skip. It sucks. <br />12. Under My Umbrella - RULES!! <br />13. Aqueous Transmission - Ah.... A nice realaxing song with a japanese guitar thing, whatever they're called and nice, soothing lyrics. I think I'm going to take a nap. zzzz
0156027321|5.0|A great read.  Fast reading without getting tripped up by piles of verbage or unclear sentences of pedantic rambling.  Although Martel was criticized for using a like scenario to \\"Max and the Cats\\", he nevertheless spins his own tale, creating a story that is although farfetched, yet rooted in empirical knowledge and the study of zoology and animal behavior.  He creates an island towards the ending which revved up my imagination and kept me up all night thinking about it.  The book is great fun and can be read in only a couple days.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album... well it just rocks plainly said. Nonsense turns into a great musical experience for the ears. Shavo sucks as a bassist but everyone else is good, especially John. Short, but great. <br /> <br />1. Prison Song - Awww yeah. Great intro, awesome song, it had the works. 10/10 <br />2. Needles - Rules. Just rules. 10/10 <br />3. Deer Dance - Bang your head until you get a concusion. Fun! 10/10 <br />4. Jet Pilot - Starts out fast, middle is fast, ends fast. Wow. 9/10 <br />5. X - Not bad.... very short. 9/10 <br />6. Chop Suey - At first I HATED this song. Then I started to like it. 8/10 <br />7. Bounce - I'm always tired after this song. Probably because I jump around everywhere when I here it. 11/10 <br />8. Forest - Longest song on album at 4:00. Wow, that's sad. still rules. 9.5/10 <br />9. ATWA - Rules. 10/10 <br />10. Science - My least favorite subject and my least favorite song on this album. Wow. 6/10 <br />11. Shimmy - Not good either. 7/10 <br />12. Toxicity - Good single. 10/10 <br />13. Psycho - Go Psycho Groupie Cocaine Crazy! 10/10 <br />14. Aerials - Sucks. 7/10
B00000K0DQ|5.0|DEAD MAN WALKING is a difficult film to watch, in that it is so hard to decide if the death penalty brings redemption or closure.  Director Tim Robbins wisely shows both sides of this long fought controversy.  For every time we see Sean Penn's side of things, Robbins makes sure we see the bodies of the two young people whose lives were taken.  Penn is marvelous in his role as Matthew Poncelet, an embittered, hard young man whose time on death row has yet to prepare him for his road to redemption.  Susan Sarandon gives an Oscar worthy performance as Sister Helen Prejean, a nun who finds herself becoming Penn's spiritual advisor as the time for his execution draws near.  Sarandon is brilliant as she fights her internal demons, wanting to bring Penn his redemption, but wanting to console the families of the victims as well.  Raymond J. Barry, F. Lee Ermey and Celia Weston are superb in the roles of the victim's parents, and Robert Prosky delivers a fine performance as a lawyer who tries a last ditch attempt to stay the execution.<br /><br />The movie doesn't preach at us or make decisions as to what is right.  Penn's crime is a hideous one, but it is to his credit that we still feel sympathy for him as he approaches his execution.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril lavigne impressed everyone with her first album, &amp;quot;LET GO&amp;quot;. After that it seemed though she had fallen off the planet. Till a couple years later. Avril came back and had a chalenge to win everyone back who thought she was gone forever. But  even though her first album was super great, her seconde CD is just as great, maybe a little less great then the first one (Cause it was unbeatable). Her seconde album is called &amp;quot;UNDER MY SKIN&amp;quot;. Her new CD has ton's of great song's, like, the ever so popular song you hear on the radio all the time: My Happy Endding, Her less popular radio song: Don't Tell me. Then there are alot more awsome ones like my personal favorites: Freak out let it go, Together and A brand new day. It totally rock's! Avril hasn't let her fan's down. If your an Avril fan I suggest, buy the CD.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|This film is great for mindless entertainment- I mean SUPURB! It is like a roller coaster ride where you love everything that happens and you don't have to wear yourself out emotionally because there isn't any high-drama; this is an action film, what were you expecting? A deep chat of love and devotion? No way- this baby is filled with the most pointless FX and random battles a person could ever dream of seeing- and I loved every moment of it. The acting is sufficient for the script and the story is encaptivating enough to keep one's interest at all times. Also the DVD extras are very enjoyable to watch. There are tons of bloopers that are most amusing and commentaries that are entertaining and really good documentaries. Also it has this smashing feature where you can watch the movie and see it like they're filming it- which is really neat (and intersting to me at least) Some movies were made to be masterpieces, some were just made so that when you walk away from it all you can think is \\"Wow, that was pretty cool\\".
B00008PX8P|5.0|Best DVD that I have seen from a band.  Truly awesome band.  Can't get enough of it, especially the first concert at the Royal Albert Hall, 1970.  It is special because it is the entire concert with no interruptions.  Furthermore, Plant's voice was at it's best.  Splendid shots of Page's beautiful '59 Burst.  Best thing about this DVD over others I have seen is that most of the time (~95%), their fingers actually follow what the audio is playing, ie correct actual footage.  Very little clips haphazardly thown in for continuity purposes irrespective of what the audio is playing, with the Immigrant song being the obvious exception.  There is a lot to be said for that.  Page probably made sure on this.  A good example of this kind of crap being put on the fans is The Who Live at the Isle of Wight.  It should also be noted for this DVD of how much music and footage we get, it's great!  Jimmy Page did us all a great favor granting us this spectacular DVD.  Thanks Jimmy!
B00003CWOL|3.0|My only arguement about this movie was that it wasn't as contraversal as I had hoped. It was really good though- and was made to be exactly what it was: a comedy with a point. Just because the target here is Catholasicm doesn't mean that they're against the religion, it's just that it was the only one that would allow the plot to actually WORK. Jay and Silent Bob are very amusing as the comedy relief characters and in the end we learn a lesson: Be who we really are- and it's okay to kill angels- sometimes. <br />The only real FLAW in the movie is the way that Bartalbe and Loki's personalities COMPLETELY flip flop in the end. First Loki wants to kill people and Bartalbe's like \\"Calm down\\" then Bartalbe is all \\"I will slaughter all humanity and drink their blood the merciless sinners\\" and Loki is all \\"Why would we want to kill people?\\" Alanis Morset as God was also an interesting addition to the cast, but whatever. THis movie is enjoyable for some, and if you already know that you're not going to like the movie because you have strong beliefs: PLEASE just don't watch it and save yourself the frustration you'll cause yourself and others. <br /> <br />Heh heh... Alan Rickman as Medataron.... great!
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I loved Braveheart, Gladiator and Rob Roy so I couldn't wait to see Troy despite the mixed reviews from England and America and thank God I didn't listen to the bad reviews. Absolutely fantastic!  <br /> <br />Brad Pitt did a terrific performance as the famous Greek warrior, Achilles who leads 50,000 men to conquer the last city, Troy, that is stopping the sinister king, Agyrmemnon, fantastically played by Brian Cox, from ruling the whole of Greece BUT there is also another reason why he's trying to conquer and that is because of Helen, played by the sexy Diane Kruger, who runs away, with Paris, the prince of Troy, played by Orlando Bloom, from her husband, played by Brendan Gleeson, who is Agyrmemnon's brother. <br /> <br />Are you with me so far? There is a lot to get through in this film I'm surprised it didn't take 2 hours 45 minutes! <br /> <br />Thus causing the greatest and most famous battle of all time. Also starring Peter O'Toole, Sean Bean and the underrated Eric Bana who did a superb performance as the famous Trojan warrior, Hector. <br /> <br />Be warned people who have read Homer's Illiad which the film is based on might be disappointed considering you must remember since when does a film actually stay true to the original story. <br /> <br />Also, the film is quite long so be prepared. I sit through anything but if you're not like me you might fidget a bit but it will be worth it in the end.   <br /> <br />With an all star cast, a great story, superb battle sequences and touching drama, Troy is a true example of an epic.
0397002327|5.0|By now I'm sure that Miss Jean Brodie and her prime are better known from the film than from the original novel. The film, and the absolutely wonderful stage production that preceded it in London with Vanessa Redgrave as the first Brodie, caught one side, the caricature side, of Muriel Spark's immortal creation, but the story is a more complex matter altogether, short though the book is.<br /><br />Any story by Muriel Spark is complex up to a point - her way of thinking is devious and unstraightforward and her characters tend to inhabit the moral and motivational lowlands. Insofar as they seem like real people at all rather than clever animations, her attitude towards them is usually ambivalent. Indeed it's almost fair to say that she makes her feelings for her own creations clearest, and expresses them most strongly, when those feelings consist most of repugnance, as with Patrick Seton and Father Socket in The Bachelors. Nevertheless she always seems to distance herself successfully from their general squalor through her quick wits and the dazzling speed at which she keeps rearranging the scenery.<br /><br />This book has a lot of the familiar Spark `feel' to it, but it's a bit different in some ways too. It's short, but it doesn't come across to me as a lightweight effort like The Abbess of Crewe. The cast of characters is not as large as in The Bachelors or The Ballad of Peckham Rye, but it's large enough. What makes it simpler is that it consists largely of a group of juveniles on the one hand, and on the other it is absolutely dominated by one single outsize personality, maybe the nearest to a true heroine or hero that Spark ever allowed herself. Jean Brodie is a silly woman but not a mean or corrupt one and that, in a novel by Muriel Spark, is quite something not to be. Another thing that may have softened the author's stance is that the setting is not London or the east side of Manhattan or Crewe or any other foreign clime, but her own native Edinburgh. I don't suppose she is trying to conceal her affection for it (although being who she is she doesn't indulge it either), or if she is she has failed at that. I can recognise the kinds of people and the kinds of attitude through a similar if not identical background, and it has brought out a most unusual candour in the author. At the start of chapter 3 there is a very straightforward account of the kind of Edinburgh spinster that Jean Brodie exemplifies. Spark typically springs it on us who it was that `betrayed' Miss Brodie, but once she has done so she takes us through the person's thought-processes with a most untypical clarity. The book shuttles backwards and forwards through time-frames, but this time with a sheer naturalness that conceals the cleverness of it. There is even a rare glimpse into the author's fascination with Catholicism when she discusses Miss Brodie's semi-ecumenical religious interests. Above all the typical spurts of sarcasm and ridicule are more often funny than bitchy, not the other way round as is more usual from her.<br /><br />A taste for Muriel Spark is a bit of a mini-religion itself. This book might make her a few converts.I don't suppose she is trying to conceal her affection for it (although being who she is she doesn't indulge it either), or if she is she has failed at that.

B0002NIAZW|4.0|Day After Tomorrow should Not be considered a Science Fiction movie, rather a Drama of one possible future created by, probably the Animal with the shortest history on Earth, Man.  Action sequences were well done.  Dennis Quaid & Tobey Maguire do a great job.  However there are a few badly written scenes, it's not perfect, hence 4 stars.<br /><br />I find the scenario quite believable.  Definitely worth a rental, and if you are a fan of Science Fiction movies, probably worth purchasing.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I love Telegraph Road , which was the main reason I bought this classic Dire Straits album. An unusual record (it has just 5 titles, each a long, intricate piece) that yielded just one hit, Love Over Gold was a huge #1 success in 1982-83 on British and Australian album charts. Dire Straits were one of the leading bands of that era, and displayed instrumental mastery and a storytelling lyrical style courtesy of leader and guitar champion Mark Knopfler. Telegraph Road is his epic. A true story-song , this 14-minute track conjures up a broad narrative sweep , and evokes memories of urban life and legends while being composed of dramatic sequences , tempo changes and actually seeming to be about 3 parts rolled into one piece (historical prologue, sweet piano interlude, and dramatic escalating coda). It is really brilliant, and is a piece I recall from the time (it may even have been played once or twice on the radio). Private Investigations seems to be about world-weary detectives in a gloomy nocturnal cityscape, and is also really evocative, while the meandering tune It Never Rains is another typical Mark Knopfler tale with a languid tune. Love Over Gold the title song is again long (and probably works better as a concert edit on the Alchemy video) but is another good one, while the amusing rocker Industrial Disease, though never a chart hit, remains a rock radio favourite today. It featured the familiar Dire Straits chugging beat and organ intro (not unlike Walk Of Life and The Bug from later albums). <br /> <br />Overall, this is a famous 1982 album that contains memorable music that retains its powerful imagery to this day.

B000002NJS|5.0|This 13-track CD was released in March 1998, and is, by a long way, Madonna's best album. It had been 4 years since her previous album Bedtime Stories, and in that time her music had diversified and improved, her voice had become stronger, she'd gained newfound insights through parenthood and spiritual searchings, and most crucially, she had teamed with cutting-edge producers to give Ray Of Light an up-to-the-moment \\"cool\\" factor her records had been lacking since the worldwide #1 hit Vogue a long 8 years earlier in 1990.  <br /> <br />And what good songs she came up with! Frozen is great - a minor-key tune with an impressive icy blue-black video and some great remixes (I particularly like the Stereo MC's remix of this track). As the first single of the Ray Of Light campaign, Frozen did very well in the UK and Australia. Ray Of Light is a sensational fast track with a clubbing/dancing feel and a brilliant fast-motion video (one of the best pop music videos ever, in my opinion). Even better is the opening track Drowned World/Substitute For Love where Madonna's changed priorities and wise insights come to the fore. This is so good. It leads into the groovy track Swim, with superior production. Nothing Else Matters is a pop song that was lifted to the next level of effectiveness with interesting production and modern whizzes and electronic whirrs overlaid. The rave-y track Sky Fits Heaven is also really good and has fast beats and the same \\"travelling...\\" bit that is in her 1995 single Bedtime Story. I didn't particularly like Candy Perfume Girl or Mer Girl , but they did grow on me somewhat and stand as unusually warped Madonna lyrics, while the Hindu-sounding Shanti-Ashangti hints at Eastern spirituality. Her ballad side comes out in soft tunes The Power Of Goodbye, To Have And Not To Hold and the happy song Little Star (written for her daughter).  <br /> <br />Ray Of Light deservedly won Grammy Awards for Best Pop Album in early 1999, and saw Madonna re-emerge as aforce once again in pop and dance music circles, an amazing 15 years after her initial breakthroughs into the scene with Holiday and the Madonna album in 1983. Who would have predicted that the former disco dolly would still be at the top after so long?! <br /> <br />5 stars

Billie Joe is one of the best singers out there because he knows how to work his voice to give the songs more feeling.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|Let's just say I expected a lot more out of this movie. As they form a bond, Charlotte and Harris certainly are touching, most definitely because--not in spite of--they do not get involved romantically. That is what makes it so disappointing; there isn't much cause to get teary-eyed at the conclusion, because over the course of the film, you keep wondering when something like a story will start, and when it doesn't, you have little emotional investment in its nebulous finish. The film is mainly a montage of Japanese sights, which rocks if you're a fan of Japanese nightlife, but it just isn't enough to make a movie out of. If Coppola had wanted to make a \\"valentine to Tokyo,\\" she should have stuck to a documentary, in which nobody would have expected a plot. <br />
B000002LQR|5.0|this is the most solid album i have ever listened to, i have over 350 albums and I dont think that any of them even come close to comparing to this one. Blood Sugar Sex Magik dosent have on bad song it wait..... there isnt even a good song on it the entire album is excellent. The lyrics are amazing and every instument is played with such skill its like an orgasm for your ears. Whenever I listen to this cd i just have to smile. The mix between hard songs funky songs and great rock ballads is amazing. And who can forget the 90's classics such as under the bridge, give it away and suck my kiss are on it but those songs are just a bonus all the other songs on this cd are just incredible. theres even a robert johnson cover! Dont hesitate on this one its the best piece of music you will ever hear BUY IT NOW

B00005R23Z|5.0|You may not be able to tell a good book by its cover, but it seems to me that much of the time you can tell a good movie by its opening credits. GATTACA begins with extreme closeups of the genetic material falling off of a man while he grooming himself early in the morning, at the main credits appear with the letter of the genetic code standing out from the other letters. A brilliant opening score is paired with this beginning, and it only gets better from there. Like the opening credits, the entire movie is less about flash and more about substance, depth, and (in my opinion) sheer genius.<br /><br />GATTACA is a science-fiction film, but unlike the science-fantasy people have come to associate with the genre (Star Trek and Star Wars for instance), it focuses on the ideas of the possible and their implications rather than on silly monsters and overblown special effects. You could say that GATTACA is at its heart a 1984-style tale of a dystopian future, but the effect of slightly altered reality is so perfectly subtle (the only differences between our world and this one is frequent rocketship launches, faster computers, electric vehicles, and a stylishly retro feel) that it may be the exquisite camerawork and cinematography (with a slight yellow-green tint to everything) that ultimately gives you the feeling that something in this world of tomorrow is not-quite-right.<br /><br />There is no gene for the human spirit. When discrimination is down to a science, and the gene police are everywhere, a normal flawed human being has to push themself to their limits and beyond, \\"exceeding their potential\\" in order to find their dreams and be freed from an invisible social-order prison. The struggle of the protagonist (one Vincent Freeman) against a world obsessed with perfection makes for an incredibly gripping drama.<br /><br />Indeed, this film features some of the finest performances I had ever witnessed. Everyone does a spectacular job, but there are some standouts. Ethan Hawke gives the finest performance I ahve ever seen out of him. Ditto for Uma Thurman, who gives a perfect icy performance as Irene. And Jude Law... plays a perfect person in a way that had me crying foul when he wasn't nominated for best supporting actor.<br /><br />Actually, I was surprised when I found out this movie was only nominated for one Academy Award (and won 0!). I really feel it should have won for best script, best cimematography, best director, best supporting actor, and best film score (perhaps the finest that Michael Nyman ever created). But with Titanic coming out that year, even the tour-de-force Hamlet was ignored.<br /><br />This movie will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the finest science-fiction films ever created. In my opinion, it is one of the few truly perfect films ever crafted. Any serious fan of science-fiction will probably want to own this one.s.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|Spears' latest album is very weak!  Not only is her voice begining to sound even more childish before, but it's also being covered with electronics!  There's a few good songs on this album: \\"Brave New Girl\\"-excellent, \\"Everytime\\"-although not the best, vocally, the song is a great ballad and \\"Shadow\\"-yet again not vocally powerful, but a great song, nonetheless. <br />Spend your money on her first two albums.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I was one of many to be fooled by Mike Moore. Origionally, I thought Mean Mike had one heck of a masterpiece, until I heard the real story that is explained in the new blockbuster Fahrenhype 911. I am not an ardent Bush supporter, and I am angry because Moore allowed the rug to be pulled out from under him BECAUSE HE DID NOT STICK TO THE FACTS!! Dad Burnitt!! Moore could blow this election for Kerry yet!!
6305971099|1.0|I would have given this unbearably pathetic crud-fest two stars but Michael Myers failed to accomplish his main goal: to wipe out that screeching, hollaring, slobbering child actress whose relentless shrieking of the word: \\"TINA! TINA! TINA!\\" will echo in your memory for years to come. Sometimes Danielle Harris, the little girl, resembled a dummy, as the camera froze on her face. Then, somehow, she would start to twitch, moan, roll her eyes, and go into a full-fledged fit of weeping, moaning and gasping. She was only equalled by similar antics of that old hambone, Donald Pleasance. His identical gestures, when he grabs the child and demands that she remember something, are strangely alike. I can see the director now, screaming: \\"Show more emotion! Give us more ham! Roll your eyes more! Slobber and mutter more!\\" In this movie, Michael dies about fifteen times. I finally lost count. He was shot and run down by a car and burned up and beaten over the head with an axe and stabbed and pushed down stairs and crashes through windows--but you know how it is with Michael Myers. A good monster is hard to kill. One final nightmarish flourish at the very end: just before we're finished,  the camera moves in on our shrieking little Joan Crawford. She's finally settled down and looks very mournfully at the camera and she says something like: \\"I don't think he died.\\" Uh oh. That means--that means more--\\"TINA! TINA! TINA!\\"
0812932293|4.0|Branson has had in incredible adventure.  Just when you think there's no way he can do it, he does it.  His writing is equally outlandish, a lot of details and flourish in his triumphs.  But you have to give him credit, he is certainly one who thinks \\"outside the box\\" and does it extremely well.  Reading the book just for this insight is worth it.  Also what's heartening is that both his family life and business life thrills him.  He shows the importance of family amidst the success.  Reading him gives one hope for the impossible.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This ultra-violent torture movie ranks right up there with \\"Hannibal\\" and \\"Fight Club\\" as one of the nastiest movies of all time.  Whereas other violence-indulgent films profess nihilism, this one uses excessively graphic images of human suffering in order to drive home a message.  But the message is lost amidst the relentless carnage.  Mel Gibson needs help.  So does anyone who enjoys watching this film.  Those who use this movie (as Gibson himself intended it to be used) to try to make people feel so guilty and horrible that they'll seek Jesus are guilty of exploitation.  This is an exploitation movie, pure and simple.  Unless you want to ruin your day and give yourself disturbing nightmares, stay away from this.  If you want a Christian movie with an actual story and a sense of decency, then go buy Ben-Hur or The Ten Commandments.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|I can't believe how much some reviewers have missed the point totally of this movie.    Firstly the puppet work has laughably been called 'cheap'.  It's based on the work of Gerry Anderson who created Thunderbirds, Stingray and Joe 90 among others.  The puppet work in these 60's shows was 'cheap'.  It's like critising a Fellini homage for being filmed in black and white.  Secondly, the destruction of the sites of Paris and Egypt for a few terrorists wasn't just 'dumb violence'.  Wasn't the treasures of Iraq and Afghanistan reduced to rubble in search of the same goal?  It's supposed to be funny people!  Either you 'get' Matt & Trey or you don't - and I can appreciate why a lot of people do not like their somewhat ascerbic take on the world - but at least have enough of the grey cells to understand what they're trying to achieve without missing the point by a mile!  The actual plot about Team America trying to stop terrorists exploding bombs in major world cities does become bogged down in it's own politics towards the end as they try to lampoon just about everyone with a vested interest in world peace or world domination.  You do get the feeling, particularly in the last act, that Matt and Trey were making it up as they went along and adding and changing ideas ad hoc.  I feel that this confused the plot somewhat and perhaps made for a messy finale.  Overall though this is a few notches above 'Cannibal', 'Orgazmo' and 'Baseketball' and should be enjoyed by all fans but is unlikely to find new converts.  DR
0767802470|5.0|Plenty of other reviews here, so I'm going to limit myself to one recommendation--watch this superb movie in German, with the English subtitles. Don't watch it dubbed in English. Thankfully, I watched it in the original language first (and, as always seems to be the case for me when a movie is really good, promptly forgot I was even reading subtitles). Later, I saw it dubbed in English & it was an astonishing experience--it really weakened the movie for me. See the original. The claustrophobia and the sense of the stakes involved are tremendous in this very, very powerful movie.
B00005JMEW|2.0|You will be at a lost for words with this movie. The big budget of it guarantees you well designed scenes. The special effects is a mix of low budget mediocrity and some well made shots. However, the merit of the movie falls into mediocrity. With all the money spent in this movie, at least some could have been spent on the plot and story. <br /> <br />Essentially \\"Kill Bill\\" is eye candy and nothing else. The shocker of the movie is the ending.... a unapologetic and blatant sucker punch to lead you into the second part (sequel). <br /> <br />I will agree with another reviewer in that it a great movie if you like to see women/girls duke it out with each other. What does that say about the movie audience can be summed up into one word.... juvenile. <br /> <br />It a shame such actors in this movie have reduced themselves into staring in such schlock. Essentially, this movie says that the public is not intelligent and will feed on anything they are given once the movie looks \\"pretty\\" and we the public do not deserve to get in return something of worth that our money. <br /> <br />If you really want to see this movie, see it on cable/direct-tv and save your cash on something more worthwhile.
0790743507|5.0|\\"Singin' In the Rain\\" and the scene with Gene Kelly splashing around, singing the title song, are on many top ten lists for film, and this film is definitely on my list, as well, and with good reason.  I really do think that this movie (filmed in 1950) was truly ahead of its time, and had the spark, the intelligence, the biting wit, the terrific score, the fabulous dance numbers, and the stellar cast that remains timeless today.<br /><br />\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" takes a behind-the-scenes look at the silent film stars of the Roaring Twenties cinema, whose careers were put in possible jeopardy when \\"talking pictures\\" were first introduced.  Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) is a handsome, charismatic and talented Vaudvilian performer who took a leap into silent film.  His career as a man who spends film after film miming, overacting and mouthing romantic and heroic words behind a film score background are in trouble when a \\"talking picture\\" demo is presented at a Hollywood party.  His leading lady (Jean Hagan) happens to have a terrible voice that could never be transferrable to sound photos, no matter how beautiful she is.  Don also meets beautiful Kathy Seldon (nineteen year old Debbie Reynolds), a young woman and aspiring dancer who hesitates to admit her adoring love for him as an avid fan of his films.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many priceless scenes are in this film.  The humor is warm, genuine and very, very funny.  The musical numbers are first rate.  The \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" number with co-star Donald O'Connor is physical comedy and agility at its best.  He was a brilliant dancer and comic.  If I listed all of the dance and singing numbers, I would need more room!  Please view this film with family, friends or anyone you know who enjoys comedy, music, dancing, and entertainment at its best.
B0002SROSQ|5.0|First things first. It has been a decent amount of years since my last \\"review.\\" The reasons surrounding this tiny truth have to do with time constraints and simple fatigue. I am a 20 year old college student. Those who attend \\"commuter\\" colleges can and will agree that, when faced with classes & homework and real work (that pays the bills), it is too easy to become tired. With that said, the sound of this new album by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds makes it impossible for me not to review, criticize, and judge (Lest he be judged, yada yada yada). <br /> This double-album is all at once brilliant, beautiful, chaotic, serene, weathered, challenging, murderous, Biblical, loud, fabricated, and true. In fact, it may be too true - hence the contradictions.  While Abattoir Blues is manic, sharp fanged, and angry; The Lyre of Orpheus is anger turned into sadness. Together as one this album puts Murder Ballads to shame. The album has a live feel to it and Cave's vocals soar and the music stirs. <br /> <br />I was originally going to do a track-by-track commentary. Since the (double)album is a total of 17 songs I decided to mention the \\"most important\\" and, naturally, my favorites... <br /> <br />Abattoir Blues <br />1. \\"Get Ready For Love\\" - Off with a bang. There has not been this noisy of an opener since Henry's Dream. Twisted Gospel. A sure fire sign of things to come. <br /> <br />2. \\"Cannibal's Hymn\\" - Spider fingers on the guitar. Cave's vocals melt over this music. The drums remind me of how music used to (and should) sound. <br /> <br />3. \\"Hiding All Away\\" - The Birthday Party back from the dead. Anyone who said that the band lost their edge when Blixa left had better shut up and buckle up. To hear Cave scream, \\"All right now!\\" in his signature squeal is the greatest cacophony I have heard in a long while (besides \\"Don't Go Into That Barn\\" by Tom Waits.) <br /> <br />4. \\"Messiah Ward\\" - Another brilliant tune. Wonderful use of the female London Community GospelChoir (LCGC). If you were hauling the bones of some long-gone lover out of a graveyard the air would probably sound like this. <br /> <br />5. \\"There She Goes, My Beautiful World\\" - The most attention is being put on this song by magazines and most critics. I am not surprised why. Thunderous. Gospel. Moving. <br /> <br />The Lyre of Orpheus <br />1. \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" - Title track. Cave being haunted by that one album Murder Ballads. A true highlight.  <br /> <br />5. \\"Supernaturally\\" - My big favorite of The Lyre. Mick Harvey's guitar speaks for itself. Guarantee that you will be singing along with the chorus by the end of the song. Lots of sadness. Lots of fun. <br /> <br />6. \\"Spell\\" - Belongs somewhere on No More Shall We Part. Predictable Seeds but beautiful and brilliant nevertheless. <br /> <br />7. \\"Carry Me\\" - LCGC steals the song. The music reigns (and pours). Haunting and beautiful. <br /> <br />8. \\"O Children\\" - The \\"real\\" closer of the two albums. If it was not for \\"Supernaturally\\" this would be the favorite of Lyre. Same vein as No More Shall We Part's \\"Darker With The Day.\\" If \\"Babe, I'm On Fire\\" was the setting sun burning a hole through us; \\"O Children\\" is the full moon high in the sky.  <br /> <br />Do not get me wrong. All the songs deserve some kind of comment, but for all intended purposes I chose the ones that would persuade buyers. Music lovers deserve to hear this album. There is no big conclusion. The albums are beautiful, brilliant, and foreboding all at the same time. Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds are merciless and victorious. Bravo. I hope the best is yet to come. <br />
B0001ADAVK|1.0|I don't remember why I rented this movie.  Maybe it was watching the trailers, and just hoping, that it would not be as bad as it appeared from the those.   <br /> <br />Nope, it was.  And then some.  Everyone said that this was like Dead Poet's Society, but with women, but it just wasn't.  Dead Poet's society had an engaging teacher and interesting, quirky students.  This was some kind of Hollywood consciousness raising that fails miserably. <br /> <br />Julia Roberts playing that art teacher was really not all that convincing to begin with.  Actors have to transmit some kind of inherent intelligence to be believable as teachers.  She does not.  And, as usual in movies, the orders of the art time periods are mixed.  Its cave painting, then Pollack, then Van Gogh.  Uh, ok?   <br /> <br />As for the actresses, the only one I found somewhat palatable was Ginnifer Goodwin, who to me played someone who was not a stereotype or a caricature.  The rest of them....  Julia Stiles plays an overachiever.  Again.  Maggie Gyllenhall as the one who sleeps around and Kristen Dunst as the marrying one.  Boring.  Kristen Dunst's marriage falls apart.... What a shock.   <br /> <br />I also couldn't understand why this movie was made.  The 50's were a really divisive time in America, and set the stage for the 1960's.  So this slice of life from the privileged classes enjoying the privileges of the privileged classes is supposed to remind us of the \\"good old days\\" when women wore chastity belts, I mean girtles?  Women worked back then, women go to college looking for a husband now.  What message is this movie trying to transmit?  I have no idea. <br /> <br />Now these are just the same comments everyone makes, but the movie lacked one more thing.  Flesh.  Sex.  I'm not saying they should be making porn here, and I know, PG-13, and all, but no intimate situations are ever shown.  Just one scene of one of these girls, just alone, talking to their significant other, privately, the way couples do, would have been sufficient.  Instead, its just \\"oh, let's get married.  Let's get divorced,\\" etc.  Like that's what the script says.  I got the feeling that maybe there were some scenes like that, but that committee that makes the movies in Hollywood, so that they are as bland as possible and reach as wide an audience as possible said \\"cut the sex.  Don't want America's children to know anything about life.\\" <br /> <br />If you must see a Julia Roberts movie, rent My Best Friend's Wedding.  That one at least has some singing in it.
B00006J3WH|5.0|The songs I love the story I love Joss rocks the house James, Athony , Amber , Sarah, Emma and Nick are wonderful and the feeling is great I loved every momment of the C.D. ,Thank you Thank you, Thank you, I wish there was n Angel  C.D.
B00008WT5E|5.0|...That is all i freakin' hear when i pop this in the stereo!ACDC was one of the most talented bands up to this day and it shows on this awesome album.Alot of people and critics bash this one for the lack of the power-chorus hit such as \\"highway to hell\\" or \\"tnt\\".This album shows this band could do more than just come up with foot-stompin' sing along tracks.The arrangements are more diverse in the songs which just sounds amazing.The lyrics are top notch here as well.Bon was a genius.nuff said.Just listen to tracks like \\"Down Payment Blues\\" and \\"Gimme A Bullet\\" and you'll hear Bon's intelligent lyrics.This is ACDC's experimental or \\"step away from the expected\\" album.It absolutely rocks from the good-time riffin' of \\"rock n roll damnation\\" to the final chords of the menacing and brute \\"Kicked In The Teeth\\".Get this album and you will be rockin' like a mofo.Anything from ACDC's 70s catalogue is a must have.
B00006AG5N|3.0|It is interesting to read comments from fans about Elvis and some of his early music. In the very early days whilst still a wee lad, after school I had a paper delivery round, just to earn enough money to buy every record and see each film, as soon as it was released. There is no doubt in my mind that as the years went on, his music and songs degenerated, to the point that I cannot believe that \\"A little less conversation\\" is now considered by some to be \\"fabulous\\", it is rubbish!!. Some of his very best can be found in the Hymms and religeous recordings, so get yourself some copies, sit yourselves down, close your eyes and listen to some very remarkable and beautiful singing. (my favourite being \\"It is no Secret\\"), and I'm not even religeous!!
B000003MZU|5.0|I was introduced to this album several years after its initial release.  Juan Luis Guerra y 4.40 has always been one of my favorite bands hailing from the Dominican Republic.  The level of sophistication they add to their music is unmistakable.  They are one of the more polished, well arranged and catchy bands I have heard.  I only wish their music was played in the salsa clubs of Seattle.  I guess I have to head to the East coast for that!<br /><br />This album blends catchy merengue, beautiful bachata (slow, sort of like a cumbia with a \\"bounce\\") ballads, and African influence and takes it to a new level.  Example of this is prevalent in the title cut, \\"Bachata Rosa.\\"  Also, the beautiful mixture and variation in tempo in a couple of the tracks makes them especially exciting!  Whenever I listen to this album, I always see the sun even when its raining outside.  I am sure you will think so, too!
B000002J1U|5.0|Ok. I seen, heard, and felt the anger about this album. There is nothing wrong about this album. Actually, I think this album is great. Its ok for a hard rock band to write stuff like this. The reason I gave this album a 5 was that it stood out from the rest, it was like gold on a black sheet. It was a key, or a base of Zeppelin, it was essential to be there. So i recommend this album.
B00009P1O2|5.0|I'm Impressed! <br /> <br />By the time I decided to purchase this DVD I had never seen Queen performing live - in any form.  All I knew they had excellent songs.  I had also heard that Freddy Mercury was an amazing entertainer.  The bottom line is that I was impressed with the band's live show and Freddy's showmanship as well as talent.  I truly enjoy every bit of it every time I watch it. <br /> <br />Great DVD!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Even for those who fear change in music and stick to mainstream, OK has something for everyone.  A progressive/experimentalesque album, OK spans every emotion from fear to love, from angst to anger.  It is as if Yorke and Co. poured out their soul onto a CD.  This album stretches the limits of instruments without breaking them.  Haunting guitar solos and assorted distorted noises are used as adornments to the beautifully landscaped rhythms.  If anyone truly loves and appreciates music, they will appreciate this CD.  It is among the best of our day.  Make sure you read the background stories of the songs also, it colors them further.  For more mainstream people, check out Karma Police, Paranoid Android and Electroneering.  For those who like to go deeper, Climbing the Walls and Exit Music should leave you very pleased!
B0000508U6|5.0|I recently bought this CD and must say that it is my favorite listen.  Every single song is worth listening to, again and again.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Personally, I prefer Princess Mononoke because of the complexity of its story.  Nevertheless, the beauty and wonder of Spirited Away can not be denied.  The plot of a girl making her way without her parents has been done before, but Miyazaki proves the tale can still be fresh.  Chihiro/Sen is a wonderful character: a petulant and occasionally bratty child who becomes brave and learns to rely on herself in a dangerous and strange world.  I also appreciated her sweet romance with Haku, a young man who helps her and soon turns out to be much more than he seems.  But not only Haku, Chihiro ends up facing many strange and wonderful creatures in the witch's bathouse.  A lake God polluted beyond recognition, a many-armed man who works the heaters, an enormous baby who is turned into a mouse ... <br /> <br />All of these characters and this world is created lovingly by Miyazaki.  The animation, which remains mostly hand-drawn, is a wonder to behold.  The characters move so fluidly and realistically, and the designs of some of the gods is unlike any seen before.  After watching this film, the viewer feels like they have journeyed through an entirely new world.  It's amazing. <br /> <br />The movie also features a beautiful score that's both magical and haunting.  I loved it. <br /> <br />DVD features for the movie are also top-notch.  My favorite was the \\"Making of\\" which gave a look at the animation process in Japan and a glimpse of Miyazaki in action.  The interviews with the American voice actors were also interesting, but on the whole I prefer subtitles. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful movie that I recommend to all.  Even non-anime fans.
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|I bought this CD for my wife who likes Celine's music but even she admitted (in so many words), \\"boring....boring....boring\\".  I cannot tell you had bad this album is.  The only bright spot is her version of John Lennon's \\"Beautiful Boy\\" which isn't half bad.  If alive today, Lennon would give her the benefit of the doubt and say, \\"good job\\" when in fact he'd be thinking, \\"plain ole' rubbish\\".  Anyway, the whole CD is rubbish and perhaps she should start crooning like Rod Stewart to save her falling career.
B000002J03|5.0|Coming out of the ashes of the Yardbirds, releasing their first album, Jimmy Page is at it again. This album, consisting of blues and their famous one riff songs, such as Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker, and Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman). <br />I highly recommend you buy this album to add to your collection, if you havent done so.
B000127LW2|4.0|It was interesting to take a look back on who was the original Executive Officer (Lieutenant Commander Cavit), the original Chief Medical Officer (Lieutenant Commander Fitzgerald) and the original helmsman (Lieutenant Stadi) since the characters died on the pilot episode and we all forgotten about them. Still, we never knew who was the original Chief Engineer.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow I really hate Britney spears, but this CD was awsome, I bought it after I listened to it on the leak at MTV.COM and I fell in love with it, I know the CD has been out for about a year now, but that doesnt stop me from litening it is still one of my favorites, and the songs never get old!<br /><br />Me against the Music-8/10--This song is just so cool, you know when you make a song with madonna it's great!

I like this one alot! <br /> <br />Me against the Music remix-8/10-- Not to much different from the original, just some different beats and stuff..it sounds pretty cool just like the original. <br /> <br />All in all this cd is really cool, I think all of you guys should purchase this CD! great addition to her past cd's! good job Britany! <br /> <br />When I add up my scores it's about 94/130 which is about a 72 average, which is a C, but her cd..is realy beyond average and I think deserves all 5 stars, she just has a few bad tracks that killed her rating, but it's all good...great job britany!
B0002O06N0|5.0|i had to listen to it a time or two for it to hit... but this cd is killer! It has a friggin' soul, one of the best cd's ive ever listened to. if i had to have one complaint, it would be that the cd is too short. I really wish a few of the songs would have gone on for 5 or 6 minutes instead of running 2:14... otherwise, Excellent disk
038533348X|3.0|My father is a Vonnegut fanatic so this book came highly recommended to me.  Having finished it a few days ago I feel that I can make a fair assessment of the book. <br />I have read one of Vonnegut's other works before Breakfast of Champions having read that and now this I notice a trend of Vonnegut's style of writing.  You almost get a feeling that he is stalling, not inserting any action.  In Cats Cradle nothing exciting happened until there were 30 pages left in a 200 page book.  It wasn't even as if he had built up the anticipation for something to happen either.  Vonnegut just keeps reintroducing more and more information for you to swallow.  He even goes so far as to make up words for his Bokonism religion.  The words were often times hard to remember which was which, presenting discontent.  However the book was not all bad.  The book provides a very radical insight of the world and makes one truly question their beliefs.  However it's a very pessimistic view, as is common in most of Vonnegut's work.  After finishing the book I felt very depressed and didn't enjoy my reaction to the conclusion to the book.   Vonnegut depicts how the human race will inevitably destroy itself.  All and all this book is okay if you're on vacation and get to read it everyday.  Otherwise you forget some details on the religious words and what have you.  That is why I give this book 3 out of 5 stars. <br />
B000002J09|5.0|First thing is first, if you like Led Zeppelin, than this is a definite album to start with. Anyone who can give less that 5 stars on this set is NO ZEPPELIN FAN. The album's music is beyound belief, beyound imagination. So I seriously recommend this album. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00063MBU8|5.0|I thought Simple Plan did a great job with this cd. The songs are catchy and if you listen you can actually find meaning or a message to the songs. They give you something to relate to. The last song on the cd is a little different than what they usually do, but even realizing that I really liked the song. I haven't been able to stop playing it yet... and the more i listen to it the more i realize how much i like the songs. It was definitely worth buying!!
B00063MBU8|5.0|Excellent album put together here by the group from beginning to end.  At least these guys have stuck to the style that got them to where they are (unlike the sell-out's of Good Charlotte).  A must have album.
0803726570|5.0|Our children loved this book, as did we!!!  One of our all time favorites ~ and one that will be enjoyed, and cherished between Oct. 31st through Oct. 30th!!!  There is nothing not to like... nothing.
B0002FQMU0|1.0|No Roth, no Van Halen.  End of story.
B000667FN8|5.0|Simple Plan's second original CD, \\"Still Not Getting Any . . . \\" gives its legion of fans no letdown after the long wait for the second CD.  If anything, it is an improvement on the first.      Fans at their shows have already been introduced to \\"Welcome to My Life\\" and \\"Shut Up!\\", both good, catchy songs just packed with the adolescent angst that is SP's trademark.  \\"Shut Up!\\" in particular, shows the band's knack for combining downbeat lyrics with upbeat tunes, in a song which I interpret as a teenager's thoughts while being lectured by his parents.      Something's changed a bit from the first CD, and that's the band's perspective.  Many of the songs on \\"No Pads, No Helmets, . . . Just Balls\\" had the perspective of a teen complaining about a poor relationship with a parent.  There's still a bit of that in songs like \\"Me Against The World\\" and \\"Shut Up!\\", but this time, more songs talk about a romantic relationship gone bad (for example, \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Thank You\\"), and the perspective is more young adult than teenager--\\"Everytime\\" talks about the partner waking the singer at 3 a.m. and driving to dawn--not likely if still living at home.  The band's characters are maturing, as is their music.      Other notable songs include \\"Crazy\\", a throwback to Reset's (the predecessor band to Simple Plan) socially-conscious songs, and \\"Jump\\", plainly intended as a concert song but very strong in its own right.      Perhaps the strongest song on the CD is \\"Untitled\\", a downbeat song with downbeat music, the dying thought of someone who doesn't know why he's dying, and despite the people around him, is dying utterly alone.  The sadness which runs through many of the band's works is here in full strength.  Softer than usual and using a piano (shades of \\"Meet You There\\" on the first CD), even if never released as a single, it may well be the band's best song to date.      While lead singer Pierre Bouvier did almost all the singing on the first CD, much more is heard from backup singers Sebastien Lefebvre and David Derosiers, who do a lot more of the singing here, and they are well worth listening to.      Extras on the DVD or flip side (depending on edition) include the video for \\"Welcome to My Life\\" and the program (shown, I believe, on MTV) about its making.    Highly, highly recommended.
B0002OERI0|4.0|Old Green Day will always be better than new Green Day, but new Green Day is still a great group. Thankfully \\"American Idiot\\" solidified them as a quality group again making original music. \\"Nimrod\\" and \\"Warning\\" were both bad albums. The quality of the tracks were crap and seemed thrown together. While this album does have a few lame tracks, for the most part it's classic entertaining Green Day. The long-duration tracks are a great addition. While the sound is more mainstream than hard, fast punk, it still stands up to make a good CD. Thankfully, whatever they lost for a few years ago they seemed to pick back up. It's not the same as \\"Dookie\\" and \\"Insomnia\\", but it's still worth checking out.
068987474X|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but I thought it focused to much on what NOT to do...okay, then, tell us what we SHOULD DO (doing nothing is not an option for most of us). I thought that \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" was more informative in that respect. There was more hands on advice about what you can do if you have this problem in dating. But if you get tired of reading all these books about how to date, another book I really enjoyed, which was just pure fun for women is \\"Bedtime Stories For Women\\" by Nancy Madore. The sexual fairy tales in her book are definitely more fun than the dates I have been on lately.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I watched this at the invitation of someone who insisted I do so, saying it would convince me Bush was a disaster for the country. What I saw, instead, were Moore's usual diatribes, cleverly constructed to misrepresent the truth. We all know Bush was inexperienced in facing the camera during his early years in office and highly self-conscious about it to boot, all of which tended to make him smirk foolishly at inopportune moments, stumble haltingly over his words and look beseechingly around, as though seeking approval. Often he would pause in mid-sentence, as though painfully aware that his enemies were all around him, waiting for him to blunder. The resultant linguistic hesitancy he evidenced inevitably made Bush blunders a nearly self-fulfilling prophecy.<br /><br />He came into office without a lot of seasoning and it showed, though he seems to have gained more poise as a result of his nearly four years in office under the relentless fire of a demonstrably partisan media and his equally partisan Democratic opponents. The result of his early lack of seasoning, of course, was that he provided the camera with plenty of footage that made him look and sound kind of dopey. Moore used whatever he could find of this footage, along with some of his own rather ingenious interviews and commentary, to construct a picture of Bush the fool, using innuendo and out-of-context shots to suggest corruption on Bush's part.<br /><br />So Moore makes the case that Bush is laughably stupid and, at the same time, cynically conspiratorial. Of course, if he is that stupid how much danger can he present to us as a cynical conspirator? He's either Bozo the Clown or Machiavelli, but he can't be both. (Moore gets around this conundrum by suggesting Bush is really the puppet of other, even more nefarious interests, including the infamous Carlyle Group, an investment company in which his father and James Baker, his father's crony, have interests, and, of course, those sneaky Saudis.)<br /><br />Adding a number of outright falsehoods for good measure (such as the claim that members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the U.S. unquestioned, when other planes were being grounded, immediately after 9/11 . . . definitively shown to be false), Moore shot a film that is highly entertaining but also demeaning to this nation and president. It's regrettable that he has such vitriol for his country or that he is unable to scope out a position of opposition based on fact and reasoned argument. But it's more regrettable that so many today have clambered on board his outrageous propaganda train and see nothing wrong with his distortions and misrepresentations and have even elevated him to a kind of cult icon. Lots of money in it for Moore, I guess, so he has, at the least, found himself another lucrative niche. But I'm sure the money isn't what interests him, right? He's in it for the betterment of society, isn't he, even if that means pushing the level of political discourse down into the gutter.<br /><br />Well, thankfully, this is all just about over and we'll soon know who the country wants as president for the next four years. Unfortunately the odds are that Michael Moore is unlikely to give up this particularly profitable niche. So brace yourselves for more of the same from the man who told our friends in France that Americans are really stupid./> <br />Adding a number of outright falsehoods for good measure (such as the claim that members of the bin Laden family were allowed to fly out of the U.S. unquestioned, when other planes were being grounded, immediately after 9/11 . . . definitively shown to be false), Moore shot a film that is highly entertaining but also demeaning to this nation and president.

B000084T18|1.0|Enter quite possibly the world's most unintelligent human being. Now turn him lose on a microphone, and play his verbal garbage over any hit radio station at least once an hour. Who decided that this idiot's nonsensical ramblings had to be recorded to ensure that every 120lb caucasian male in North America dress in XXXL clothing in order to appear tough? The \\"rapping\\" over the atrocious attempts at creating rhymic music is pathetic. I only wish \\"Fiddy Cenn\\" could understand integers, so I could give his sorry ass -5 stars.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This isn't a sellout--they sold out a long time ago, and this sounds nothing like their sellout material (Nimrod, Warning, Shenanagins). This also isn't a return to their old punk roots. This is something completely new--a third stage for Green Day. <br /> <br />I used to be a big Green Day fan but I gave up after their sound got completely poppy and mellowed out. Dookie and Insomniac were great punk albums to jam to. Nimrod was the bad sellout, and Warning was the followup sellout, which was good, but too poppy to be taken seriously. Shenanigans I never even paid attention to--I heard a single and immediately knew it was a joke. That's what I thought about this CD too when I heard \\"American Idiot.\\" But then I heard \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" on the radio. It sounded like Billie Joe's voice, but I didn't think it could be Green Day because it wasn't that Green Day pop-punk sound I'm used to; rather, it sounded more like Pink Floyd or some other rockin classic rock band. Then, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" closed out the deal. What a fresh new sound for the guys that I thought were washed up.  <br /> <br />You will not like this CD if you don't like bands like Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and the Beatles. I never thought I'd say that about a Green Day CD, but there you go. This one's different. Hopefully they'll keep this up.
1594200106|1.0|Sad to say I thought this book, which I'd very much looked forward to reading, was terrible: murky and shallow.  The identity of the dark leather-face 'mystery man', around which much of the presumed suspense revolves (and which takes the writer 350-odd gruelling pages to divulge), was only too obvious from the word 'go'.  One of the main reasons I kept reading was that I assumed my initial guess was too simple and that I must therefore be wrong.  So I was left feeling cheated and annoyed.  The writing is indeed (as one critic described it) 'florid'.  Though at times self-consciously clever, it's melodramatic, at times gruesome, contrived, and devoid of joy, enshrouding the reader in an oppressive atmosphere.  When I finished the book I felt depleted and only too relieved to emerge at last into the light of day.
B0000029DD|5.0|a great album from top to bottom and it contains the most beautiful song i've ever heard, Hallelujah (even if it is a cover). Buy the album if you like music that trancends genres.
B0001611DI|5.0|Picking up three weeks after the events in \\"Night Of The Living Dead,\\" the sequel \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" has the undead now overpopulating normal civilization. The military has ran out of ideas and every man seems to have a different idea about what to do and where to go. Throughout all this chaos, two S.W.A.T. team members (played by Scott H. Reiniger and the great Ken Foree) meet up with two television station employees (Gaylen Ross and David Emgee) and take shelter in a nearby shopping mall. Despite an incredible amount of the undead population flocking to the mall at an alarming rate, the foursome find salvation in a top-level storage space, and turn what was originally supposed to be a resting stop, into a long-term stay. However, like all societies sooner or later, the one created above the mall full of zombies begins to crumble piece by piece as the movie forges on. All four actors play their roles perfectly, and the characters conflict and compliment each other very well. Director George Romero (\\"Night Of The Living Dead\\") is very subtle and lets the story play out naturally. Although his message of anti-consumerism is a bit dated, he still manages to make the movie and the story timeless. Despite the undead being very slow, there is still a thick amount of dread and suspense piled on. There is a reason why Romero is the grandfather of zombie flicks. The zombies aren't the scary part of this movie. What is scary are the people, and how they react to the situation they are faced with, and how quickly society begins to crumble. But it doesn't hurt that special effects master Tom Savini (who, incidentally directed the remake of \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\") piles on healthy servings of gore at all the right moments (also, look out for him as the leader of the gang that breaks into the mall). The original \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" is easily one of the best horror movies ever made, and is the rare case of a sequel being just as good as the original. It also works so that if you haven't seen \\"N.O.T.L.D.\\" you can still watch this and know what's going on. The remake is good, but nothing will ever top this one. This is a movie that will stay in your head for days, and will never ever leave your subconcious. If you're looking for an intelligent and brave horror flick, go to the mall. \\"Dawn Of The Dead\\" is highly recommended.ou haven't seen \\"N.O.T.L.D.\\" you can still watch this and know what's going on.

B00020HEG6|5.0|I hate that people say that this music was differnet from that in S/PS and CoS.  POA was different from both of those because of the different story it told and yes the director, but the soundtrack had the same feel to it and I still feel as if I'm on my way to Hogwarts every timeI listen to it.  And Double Trouble RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JNEI|2.0|Michael Moore's film style is solid and engaging, and Fahrenheit 9/11 is an excellent example of that style. Seeing this movie I was shocked, so I did some research to find out more. Instead of finding out more, though, I discovered that much of this movie is highly inaccurate and designed to decieve. Were the film based on fact I'd be extremely impressed, but as it's not I'm extremely disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This movie was a great combo of a sci-fi western. It had everything that the both would include. Shoot-outs, bounty hunters, scary monsters which you didnt see only a glimpse cause it was CANCELLED :(  I  would highly recommend this movie if you love the both genres.
B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind\\" is a great 2004 release starring Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and others.  This critically acclaimed film shows more of writer Charlie Kaufman's creative mind beyond his past works \\"Adaptation\\" and \\"Being John Malkovich\\".  Some may consider this his best work.  He stays true to his signature writing style throughout this film.  The unusual events chained to one another surprisingly fit, making this film much more groundbreaking.  The plot of Joel wanting to erase ex-girlfriend Clementine from his mind takes a unique turn.  As it explores the relationship between the two - backwards - the camera graphics deeply reveal the emotions of Joel and Clementine.  Meanwhile, Joel learns his past wrongs. <br /> <br />The acting amongst the cast is amazing, namely Carrey and Winslet.  Carrey, as Joel, unbelievably holds back the signature slapstick comedy style and replaces it with his dramatic side.  This style is a big step from his previous dramatic effort \\"The Majestic\\".  He could finally receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.  Equally emotional in her performance is Winslet as Clementine.  As always, whether she expresses free-spirit or sadness, she shows how great an actress she is.  The rest express their strengths in various scenes, especially Dunst after her character discovers a shocking secret about her own past.  <br /> <br />Such film quality makes \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" enjoyable for many audiences.  Those pleased with Kaufman's work should also watch his previous works.
0671027387|2.0|This book bored me. I have read The Da Vinci Code and was not too impressed with the book, this book was Brown's second chance to impress me, unfortunately he didn't. The book was too contrived, the action was dull, and the romantic subplot ridiculously cliched. Oh and to mention the plot, it might have been interesting if not for one thing, I have encountered a book with a similar plot line called Ice Station by Mathew Reilly and it is really a much better book. So folks, if you're looking for a good \\"fly by the seat of your pants\\" kind of action book, look in to Mathew Reilly, you'll be much happier.
055357342X|5.0|This one takes the cake!  However excellent readers found his previous volumes, Martin's A Storm of Swords surpasses them all by leaps and bounds (as impossible as that may seem)!<br />This is truly epic stuff--I always stayed up too late to read this, so had to force myself to bed for health's sake...but I found I had trouble sleeping, because quite frankly, the novel's storyline and characters kept flip-flopping through my head.  Will Arya ever find her way back?  What is Dany doing?  How the hell will Robb get out of this one?  The suspense this series oozes will become as a drug...the trials that each character faces becomes truly personal...you just want things to work out so bad!<br />Just looking back, I would that if there were a list of the top 10 scenes thus far, 7 alone would come from this book.  &quot;Jaw-dropping&quot; does not even begin to describe some of the things that come to pass.<br />As a last note, perhaps most interesting is the new Jaime POV.  Readers have come to despise this character, but Martin really humanizes him, proving with a certainty that it is difficult to hate someone after at last seeing things the other way around.  A wonderful change in perspective, and expertly done.<br />Highly recommended!
B00064MW6A|4.0|I love superhero / villian movies. And although the reviews were bad i wanted to see this flick anyway. It turned out to be a really good movie. This movie works because Halle's catwoman is Very vulnerable and Very human. Given the reasons and details about her transformation into Catwoman, it makes you feel and believe in the possiblity of any of us becoming super-empowered. Atleast for the duration of the movie. I also felt the CGI effects were good and not overdone like the Incredible Hulk movie (ugh!) or even Spiderman. This movie deserved more in the way of positive press and box-office cause it Rocks! Fortunately Halle wants to do a sequel regardless of the outcome, because she enjoyed filming it so much. She did the majority of her own stunts and even broke her arm in the process. Dedication. Buy or Rent this DVD or catch it at a discount movie house near you. Set aside your prejudices on female superheros and race and just GO! By the way I only gave it four stars because I felt Sharon Stone's villian a little underplayed. I'd rather Catwoman fight a more interesting and powerful villian.

B00008V5VN|4.0|Well sleep were a pretty heavy spaced out band, and this record probably shows that the most out of all of their stuff.  well, everyone has already said virtualy everything any of you people could want to know, so i'll just say one thing: this is by no means the slowest and most droning album ever.  i mean really, this doesn't come close to earth(earth 2), sunn O))), early boris or most funeral doom when we're talking about being slow, so suck it up!  i do think this style has been done slightly better, but this is still a great album, and really stoned (if you didn't get that by the title).  i do recomend earth's earth 2, but only if you can handle something even more minimal.  drone on!    -This portion is an edit-  what was i thinking?  this review seems irritated, i guess i was expecting it to be more like earth2, how stupid of me.  this is great, long, and danm spaced out.  you knew that already... just get it, its like ambient and black sabbath at once.
0553579908|5.0|If you thought #1, A Game of Thrones, was good, get prepared for a Clash of Kings!<br />In an incredible feat of storytelling, Martin has upped the standard yet again, something I thought could not be done after the monumental achievement of A Game of Thrones.  The intrigue continues, more hell breaks loose, and power never seems to stay in one place for long.<br />For those that read Martin's first book in the series, he delivers again--the plot is just as unpredictable, the characters are developed some more, and new POVs are added to the roster (Theon and Davos).  For those thinking they can start from here--I wouldn't try it.  There is a huge cast of characters in very intricate situations layered in shady motives, loyalties, and betrayals--starting here would be very difficult.  That is not to say that this book is confusing, however; all the characters are realistic and memorable, so fans will find they know House leaders, retainers, and knights without really making an effort to learn them in the first place.<br />A lot happens in this book, and by the end, you'll be shocked.  Martin is peerless when it comes to holding an audience; more is always revealed, but newer, more urgent questions always arise.  I think you will not be able to keep yourself from reading #3, A Storm of Swords, immediately afterwards! ;)
055357342X|5.0|Like all avid readers I always pick up the newest installation in a series I am into with a certain amount of trepidation. I am always worried that this will be the book where the author blows it, and I always pretty much know that the latest book won't be as good as its predecessors. Thus does not seem to be a problem with Martin. <br /> <br />This is seriously my favorite book of the series to date and incidently my favorite fantasy book. In a series that is to date full of surprises and very complex characters, this book has once again upped the stakes. <br /> <br />Once again, many of your preconceived notions of a characters motivations and actions shall be turned on its collective ear. The characters become richer and more real than ever. And if you had mixed feelings about the Lannisters in the previous two books, all I can say is that you ain't seen nothing yet. <br /> <br />Also if you think Martin has trimmed all the characters he could from the previous two books, it is now a distinct possibility the series will end with everybody dead, which at the current rate will be about two and a third more books, so if you hated the deceptive ease in which Martin slaughtered characters in the first book prepare for pain. <br /> <br />And once again to all you fans bothered by the sex, blood, and general unpleasant behaviour of the world of A Song of Fire and Ice, if you hated it in the first two books you'll hate it here also. If you want a pretty fairy tale read go by Harry Potter. It's well written and so far Harry hasn't been eviscerated.  <br /> <br />But if you're like me and have marvelled at what Martin has done to date, you'll definitely want to add this to your collection.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Yep... the first words that popped into my head when I heard of the original Star Wars trilogy coming to DVD. Well, that happiness quickly faded when I learned of something... umm... bad. <br /> <br />Biggest downside, as everyone mentioned, is the exclusion of the original versions of each movie. I mean, come on! How hard is it to include the original versions? Steven Spielberg was able to include the original E.T. movie with his special edition of that movie. Terminator 2 had THREE different versions! Even Disney's Beauty and the Beast was able to have THREE different versions! Mr. Lucas' response? \\"It will cost millions of dollars to do\\" or something like that. Pfft! He could've gotten every penny back plus a helluva lot more had he included the original versions. Now I will never get to experience what audiences felt when the movies first came out. <br /> <br />But now we have these \\"more special editions\\" as I call it. We now see the \\"Hayden Christensen\\" Anakin form at the end of \\"Jedi.\\" I just wonder how Luke would recognize him as his father? Luke had never seen his father before. The only time he saw his face was when he removed the mask, which was the older Anakin. Now alluva sudden the young, snobby, and selfish Anakin version comes out and Luke recognizes him right away as if to say, \\"Hey, there's my dad... younger looking, I guess...\\" A totally unecessary \\"addition\\" to an already botched up version of \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" <br /> <br />And some of the added/edited scenes have been altered much more to look better, I guess. The only addition I've only accepted was the Wampa monster scenes. The rest just distract and bug me. *sigh*... who knows? But this is what George claims he's always wanted done. He b!tched and moaned about how \\"incomplete\\" his movies were, now they're \\"complete.\\" He's happy, but millions of Star Wars fans aren't. But am I happy? <br /> <br />Despite my rants, watching these movies on DVD was a truly amazing experience. Crystal-clear and sharp images (though it does reveal some \\"limitations\\" of parts of each flicks) and of course, the sound is truly amazing. I haven't watched the extra disc yet (I hear it contains spoilers for Episode III, so I'll skip it for now), but I'm happy with what I've got here. Sure, a lot of George's enhancements bug me, but there are few that were actually good. <br /> <br />\\"Star Wars\\" (aka A New Hope) is still fantastic. The one that started it all. While watching this on DVD, the very beginning of the opening credits and John Williams' score just gave me goosebumps. Even though I knew these are the \\"more special editions\\" I was still in awe while viewing this movie. <br /> <br />\\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" is easily the best out of the trilogy. A darker storyline and ending sends chills through my body. The battle at Hoth was yet another kickass sequence. And this is when Darth Vader gets his theme (bum-bum-bum-bum-ba-dum, bum-ba-dum...) and it has never sounded better. <br /> <br />\\"Return of the Jedi\\" is the most botched up of the trilogy which really ruins the experience of the movie. But the epic battle sequence at the new Death Star blows every other battle in the trilogy away. Cute lil' Ewoks running around as well, and, maybe it's just me, but I wasn't really bothered by them as were just about every other Star Wars fan. Actually, the Ewoks never bothered me. Oh well, \\"Jedi\\" is still cool. <br /> <br />Better developed reviews of each movie will come up soon... <br /> <br />Anywho, are the DVDs worth it? Well, I don't see George releasing the originals on DVD at all since in an interview he said he won't do that. So, if you're truly hard-up for the orignals, skip this. It'll only make you angrier. But, in my case, I was moderately pleased with this collection. Despite the omission of the originals, watching each flick was still an amazing experience.

B0002VKZL6|5.0|This CD is a lot like \\"The Ragpicker's Dream\\". It has a slow tempo throughout, and features well crafted songs that place an emphasis on the lyrics and often involve stories. There are no extended guitar flourishes which we Mark Knopfler fans relish. The guitar is used to highlight the songs rather than wow the audience. <br />The first half of this CD is very strong for a collection of slow songs. But the affect is subtle; it doesn't hit you over the head. I especially like \\"Back to Tupelo\\", a very expressive low-key song about an aging rock star; and \\"Boom like that\\" with it's signature Knopfler guitar line and humorous lyrics about the rise of hamburger king Ray Kroc. <br />But, like \\"A Ragpicker's Dream\\", this CD kind of starts dragging toward the end. \\"Song for Sonny Liston\\" may be interesting to hear once or twice, but musically it is repetitious. By the time of \\"All That Matters\\", I found myself resisting the slowness. That is not to say that the last half does not have it's hightlights. \\"Don't Crash the Ambulence\\" is vintage Mark Knopfler, and in the same vein and as entertaining as \\"My Parties\\" and \\"Money for Nothing\\". <br />It would have been better, in my opinion, if he had picked up the tempo more, but this work is very high quality, especially in comparison to all of the junk out there today; and deserves 5 stars. <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|I too was very surprised to find out this band is from Las Vegas as they sound like a British outfit. This album has some great variety. There are a few songs that sound like today's typical alternative music, but better. And much of the rest of the album will remind you of the 80's music you grew up with with plenty of keyboards and synth. <br /> <br />Reminds me of Ride, Killing Joke, The Cure, even one song sounds like OMD. Highly recommded.
1565123875|5.0|This is first-rate historical fiction that reads like a memoir. Written in first person narrative by the main character, Kambili Achike, a 15-year-old Nigerian girl, it is a stunningly original debut novel. <br /> <br />Brought up in an extremely privileged household Kambili is brought up by a father who is a religious fanatic, to the point of physically abusing his children and wife when they do not follow the \\"rules\\" that he imposes regarding praying, etc. As the children have grown to teens they begin to question many of their father's actions. They are not allowed to visit their grandfather because their father regards him as an \\"unrelenting pagan\\" who will poison the children's minds. The narrative is restrained yet luminous and telling.  <br /> <br />When political unrest begins to strike close to home, they are finally allowed to visit their Aunty Ifeoma's warm, crowded, somewhat impoverished household. They are transported into another world where the children speak freely; there is laughter, music and talk. Slowly they begin to realize the extent of their imprisoned lives. <br /> <br />The novel is written with sensitivity and originality in wonderful prose. It depicts an unfamiliar culture while describing family values and the universal turmoil of teenagers. I would highly recommend it to book clubs. <br /> <br />
B000031WD9|5.0|In 1999, directior Chris Weitz brought us a film that is considered to be the funniest film in the history of movies. AMERICAN PIE is a favorite amongst millions of people around the world because of its perverted and sexual humor. The characters in this film are nothing short of hilarious, with the exception Jim's annoying, pain-in-the-a**, father.  <br /> <br />    Jim Levenstein (played by Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostrycker (played by Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (played by Thomas Ian Nicholas), & Paul 'Sh*tbreak' Finch (played by Eddie Kay Thomas) are four friends, nearing the end of their Senior year at East High School in Michigan. Neither of them has yet lost their virginity. Kevin is dating his high school sweetheart, Vickie Lathum (played by Tara Reid). Vicky is confused in knowing if she is ready or not to lose her virginity with Kevin, although, Vicky's best friend, Jessica (played by Natasha Lyone) tries to help her realize that she is. Oz has learned that in order to become closer with a girl in terms of dating one is to be sensitive. In doing so, he has joined East High's A cappella Jazz choir, where he meets Heather (played by Mena Suvari). They begin a heated relationship. Jim has been going stag since he can remember. He almost had a chance with Nadia (played by Shannon Elizabeth), the beautiful foreign exchanged student, but he blew his chance...twice. Finch, whom everyone calls, \\"Sh*tbreak\\", for he never takes a dump at school, has never seen himself with a girlfriend. The four friends vow to lose their virginity by prom night. With the help of their sex-hungry nemisis, Steve Stifler (played by Seann William Scott), the four friends find themselves realizing that prom night will, indeed, be the night they get lucky. <br /> <br />    Kevin will be attending the prom with Vickie. Jim will be attending the prom with Michelle Flarehity (played by Allison Hannigan), a flute-toting-band-camp-nympho-maniac geek, who only has stories about her dorky adventures from band camp. Oz will be attending the prom with Heather. Finch will be attending the prom with himself. The prom goes well, as the gang head off to Stifler's cottege out on Lake Michigan. Kevin is the first to get lucky with Vickie. Oz is the second, with Heather. Jim is the third, with Michelle. Finch is doubting his virginity-loss, until he meets...Stifler's mom (played by Jennifer Coolidge). Just when he continues to think he will not be lucky guy #4, he finds himself on the pool table with Stifler's mom. <br /> <br />    The film is jam packed with more comedy than I could discribe, and it is all featured here on this DVD, featuring hilarious outtakes, and other special features. Another feature that makes this particular DVD special is that it is the unrated version. As you all may know, Jim tries getting lucky with a homemade apple pie. If you watch the rated version, you'll see that Jim gets lucky with the pie, while standing up. If you watch the unrated version, you'll see Jim getting lucky with the pie, while spread out over the counter. Whether you watch the unrated version or the rated version, you will have to have surgery to repair your sides after they have been split from your laughing so hard. This is a great film and it should have been seen already by all of you. If not, then buy a copy for yourselves and get ready to laugh, as our version Porky's comes your way.
B000683VI4|5.0|i really ejoyed this movie when i watched it opening weekend.  i definitely cried most of the movie and i can't wait for it to come out on dvd.
B000127LW2|5.0|Voyager pretty much degenerated into implausibility the last seasons, and it even affected Seven of Nine.  But before that, there was Kes, who you can't fail to like.  There was the ever rough-edged Tom Paris, who achieved one of the most convincing transformations.  There was the rough edge of B'Elanna Torres.<br /><br />\\"Prime Factors\\" has to be one of the better episodes, introducing the Seska arc.  And the writers could have done so much more with the Chakotay/Janeway romance.  This season reminds us of the possibilities that once seemed as endless as the Delta Quadrant.
068987474X|4.0|I already knew all this stuff in this book. I think most people do know this but they deny it when it happens to them. I have seen men actually do the same things this book acuses women of, which is basically chasing someone who doesn't want to be with them. I'm sure this problem has been around for a long time and we have all done it. Hopefully you learn after the second or third (or fourth) time! If you find yourself constantly falling for people who don't to be with you, even this book won't help you. The best thing about this book was the funny way that it was written. It was hilarious to read these scenerios which most of us have experienced from another point of view. It makes you feel a little better about it. <br /> <br />Another book I thought was above average is Bedtime Stories for Women, written by Nancy Madore.
B00005JMAH|5.0|Although events get twisted around and characters dropped (like Cho Chang for instance), this is the best HP movie yet.  Sirius Black and Remus Lupin shine with Snape getting to strut his slimy stuff, and Michael Gambon fills Richard Harris' hat and pointy shoes.<br /><br />The hints of romance between Ron and Hermione are welcome even though they don't officially get going till Book 4.<br /><br />Remus Lupin has to be the strongest father figure to date among the Hogwarts professors.  And the dementors are suitably creepy.  The Knight Bus is one of the best special effects!
0790729628|4.0|I've had the director's cut of Blade Runner for about 12 years now, on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD.  I wasn't able to find the theatrical release, and I've always disliked the director's cut, but I could never put my finger on exactly why.  He cut out the voiceover at the beginning and made the ending cooler, and still I always thought that adding the unicorn in the middle was goofy and unnecessary.  I figured Scott just had some extra footage from Legend that he wanted to find a place for.  He almost completely cut Tim Curry out of the director's cut of Legend, so I expect him to do inexplicable things from time to time.<br /><br />Then I saw it:  At the end, the other cop leaves an origami of a unicorn at Deckard's apartment.  This explains what Scott was trying to do.  It's supposed to tell Deckard that he's a replicant, due to the fact that Deckard had a \\"vision\\" of a unicorn earlier in the film.  Everyone knows his thoughts, too, because he's a freakin' robot.<br /><br />This is the stupidest plot twist in the entire history of cinema!<br />And here are a few reasons why:<br /><br />1.  Deckard got beat up, bloodied and pounded on by every single replicant in the entire movie, with the exception of Sean Young.  If he were intended to be a replicant he wouldn't have been so fragile.  Don't you think he could at least have been able to beat up Daryl Hannah or Joanna Cassidy?<br /><br />2.  At the beginning of the movie he's a retired cop.  Wouldn't he have to have been a cop for a while before in order to now be a retired cop?  I thought they only lived for five years.<br /><br />3.  The whole point of the story is that he's a human who kills without feeling, like a robot, and he falls in love with a replicant because he realizes the replicants are more alive than he is.  This is reinforced for Deckard when Roy saves Deckard's life when he doesn't have to.  Roy loves life so much he gives Deckard his as a gift.  Without this dynamic, what's the point of the movie?  Seriously, George Lucas would look at this and say \\"Man, you shouldn't mess with your movies.\\"<br /><br />4.  If the cops all know Deckard is a replicant, and they know Rachel is at his house, why don't they ice the both of 'em?  Instead, they let them get away?  Maybe that's why they pulled the happy ending; when they got to the bottom floor in the elevator the cops shot them both down.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that it has no extras, no 5.1 sound, and the worst stunt doubling in the history of movies, I still love the movie.  In fact, now that I know why the unicorn is there, I can ignore Scott's ineptitude and enjoy PKD's story the way it was intended to be.and say \\"Man, you shouldn't mess with your movies.\\"    4.

B0001ZX0PG|2.0|The basically unsatisfying tale of three friends separated by life changes, fate and time, though none of them have moved from the environs where they grew up.<br /><br />While Sean Penn gets the most sympathy I've felt since before he went to Baghdad (nicely undoing all the goodwill from \\"I Am Sam\\"), his performance and Laura Linney's urban hausfrau-meets-Laby Macbeth can't save the moral failings of this film.  Granted, any parent would feel ready to kill for Sean (except possibly soldiers' parents), but how far do you go?<br /><br />Other movies have explored this theme and I maintain that \\"Sleepers\\" addresses this sort of story better.  The book is usually better anyhow.
1401301363|5.0|I'm a Nigella lover... I absolutely adore her.  She is the ultimate \\"earth-mother\\" that I dream to be (one day).  I love her easy going to manner and lifestyle. Her books are some of the favorite and \\"go-to\\" selections.  This is right up there with \\"Domestic Goddess\\". <br /> <br />Nigella way is not about doing everything perfectly - it's about enjoying amazing food with those that you love surrounding you. <br /> <br />There is nothing more comforting (or enjoyable) to me than a great big, dense, and rich cookbook.  I love them like novel.  I love to savor the words and dialogue.  Nigella never lets me down.  She GETS it!   <br /> <br />Her recipes are universal - not just \\"English\\".  She pushes us all the explore new tastes and palettes.  Her encouragement has made me try new and unexpected ingredients and cultures.   <br /> <br />This new book about cooking for your family whatever the holiday - is an amazing journey book into what makes traditions and brings back all those amazing memories that make you feel comforted. <br /> <br />A few highlights are: <br />- Ultimate Feasts <br />- Partytime <br />- Kitchen Feasts <br />- Wedding Feast <br /> <br />I know I have gone on and on about my adoration for Nigella - but, its completely true.  I just adore her - and look forward to more and more of her work. <br /> <br />Cheers!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie is much more effective than \\"Identity\\" in portraying the nightmare of schizophrenia.<br /><br />It's a brilliant portrait of a devoted marriage and a genius convinced that he can help the good guys win the war by decoding secret messages in magazines.  The image of Nash relentlessly circling words and phrases is both haunting, terrifying and heartbreaking.  This movie inspires incredible compassion.  The love of Alicia Nash (the luminous Jennifer Connelly, who has grown up so much since \\"Labyrinth,\\" is unbelievably strong and yet fragile) makes us believe in the impossible.
0452282152|5.0|After a work-related accident Griet's father is no longer able to work, leaving the family with no income. Therefore, Griet is forced to work as a maid to earn money for her family. Along with other basic household duties -like doing the laundry and food shopping - it is Griet's job to clean her master, Johannes Vermeer's studio. Being the only one allowed in the studio Griet and her master form a friendship. Even though the two are from totally different worlds they share a common bond, all-relating to a fascinatation with painting and each other. One day Vermeer sees Griet in a new light and decides he must paint her with his wife's beloved pearl earrings. He knew this painting would cause a stir but it would be his greatest masterpiece. The news of a master painting his maid caused scandal within the small Dutch town and in his very own household. <br /> <br />I enjoyed every bit of Tracy Chevalier's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". The author takes you back to 1660 Holland and you really feel as if you're there. It has great detail descriptions of the settings, outfits, the lifestyles of the characters. I love the character of Griet, she has a beautiful personality and you get to explore every part of it. This book is a historical fiction of the story behind the famous painting, \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\". I chose to read this book because I really wanted to see the movie, however, wanted to read the book first. It's a known fact that whenever a movie is based on a book, the book is always better. If you like literary novels, historical fictions then I suggest you read this book. If you're a fan of art then you'll appreciate this book's heavy art influents. If you enjoy Vermeer's work, especially \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\", then you should read this book because he's a key character in this novel and a lot of incidents in the book are based on true facts about his life. Also, if you've seen the movie and enjoyed it, then you should defiantly read the novel as well. <br />

A great film.

B0000QX0ZG|5.0|I remember listening to this album not too long after it came out back in that cold morning in early 1997 and loved it. I was blown away by this CD. It's a shame that it sold poorly because this is one of their most consistent CDs ever. This album goes into a techno atmosphere like Zooropa but only better and more rock sounding this time. The landmark sound is present in some songs on here but this overall is an experimental record. The poor success of this and Zooropa persuaded them to return to their roots with ATYCLB which I,m not complaining at all about.<br /><br />It was foolish for critics to say that U2 veered off path and flat out screwed up. Well that's their problem because this CD is one of their highlight CDs.<br /><br />Discotheque is a techno\rock\dance number that will get your feet stomping with those phat beats. This is a bangin opener to this CD. Do You Feel Loved is a great song with synthesizer guitar licks and phat beats. This song would have been a great mainstream song. Mofo is my favorite song on this CD. This song may be too techno for casual fans but this is one of the best songs they,ve ever written. The sound effects at the beginning is a little harsh for my ears. It almost sounds like something from a Front 242 album. It has those familiar U2 guitar sounds. Things slow down with the mournful If God Will Send His Angels. This is the most beautiful song U2 have done since One from Achtung Baby from 1991. It's very mellow and joyous and sad at the same time. I played this one quite a bit during the next few days after the September 11 attacks. Staring At The Sun is a cool song with more of the synthesized electronic guitar licks. Last Night On Earth is rockin!!!!!! The sort of ambient intro is awesome. The song then becomes a hard rocking song that really gets my mental juices flowing. Gone is similar to Last Night On Earth but not quite as fast. It's another good song. It ends with the guitars still going for another 6 seconds. Miami is a song that I've heard a lot of bad talk about. I on the other hand love this song. Don't be fooled by the song title. This song is NOT a beach song. It's a strange dark trancey song with an awesome drum loop like nothing I've heard before. This song would be something to play when driving on the outskirts of a large city during the wee hours of the morning. The Playboy Mansion is another song that has been bad-mouthed. This song is a very blues-sounding song. This song is a good song. If You Wear That Velvet Dress is a quiet sensual song probably the most sensual song U2 have ever done. Please is a spooky track with an ambient sound that reminds me of looking out a window on a stormy evening. Great Song. Wake Up Dead is an average closer to this CD. The beats are average and the songs sounds thrown together. The sound effects at the beginning and ending are cool though. Probably the only thin spot on this CD.<br /><br />Apart from one thin moment this is a very underrated CD. I suggest that you run to the music store and buy this CD! It's one that you'll regret passing up! I'd recommend this one ...ong that I've heard a lot of bad talk about. I on the other hand love this song. Don't be fooled by the song title.

B00005JMCN|5.0|Just simply uplifting, the story of four people, including the horse, who need a second chance and a Triple Crown win to tell them what they already believe: that they are lame, battered, but still afire with the divine spark.<br /><br />The era of ladies' hats, white gloves, a big American sense of possibility, and horse racing at its most exciting gets the full treatment here.  No also-rans in this move; everyone's performance is perfect, particularly the ever-watchable William H. Macy as an ebullient radio announcer.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie we need.  As author Joyce Spizer says, \\"I..ask those in Hollywood to write from their heads, and their heart, not from their breasts, dirty mouths, and dumbing down of our children. We need more 'Seabiscuit' films and less 'Porky's'.\\"  I agree.
B00005B5L4|5.0|DVD-Audio is great once you've heard it for yourself. You can't believe that CD could get any better, but this disc in particular proves you wrong. And not only does it sound the best it's ever been but it has this great little-known feature of a commentary on every track! <br /> <br />You can play your disc the usual way, or if you want a bit of behind-the-scenes stuff you can access the album to play with ALL the band commenting on that particular song while you listen to it softly in the background!!!! ITS GREAT! Did you know that The Chain was originally a Christine song which was then re-written by everyone? Or that Silver Springs was originally listed on the LP but had to be removed because Vinyl couldn't run that long and something had to go? <br /> <br />Get this album if you're a real FMac fan!
6305696071|3.0|I found both reactions inside myself.  I still can't help gushing when Edward takes Vivian to be barefoot in the park and to the opera.  And Hector Elizondo and Jason Alexander light up the screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, glamorizing prostitution isn't the way to go, and did you notice that the original VHS cover made no mention of Vivian's profession?  Granted, Vivian is a likable character, but it's far more likely that she would go the original route in this movie.  The first draft was called $3,000 and portrayed Edward as a completely emotional vacuum, cold and callous, and reports have surfaced that Vivian was a drug user (the famous \\"dental floss\\" scene in the bathroom turned out much differently).  But hey, this is Disney.  We want romance!<br /><br />I can't escape this movie, because when I was in the Reg. Bev. Wil., I couldn't help thinking, \\"This is where 'Pretty Woman' was shot!\\"
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Personally, I haven't seen the original, and haven't read the book either. Why does everyone have to compare them? Why can't this movie just stand alone by itself, without being compared to its predecessors? Having done some hard looking, I haven't seen a good review about this movie. This is a great movie, which stands alone by itself, and is Back To The Future, and Mummy Returns (you'll see why later) all rolled into one.<br /><br />I wanted to get this movie, because I heard a lot about Samantha Mumba giving up music for this (she's an Irish singer, and a few hits over here, by the same guy who managed Westlife & Boyzone, Louis Walsh). There's so much hoo-ha about singers-turning-actors and actors-turning-singers. Everyone wants to criticise them. Frankly, all the guys will like Samantha in this, as at one point she's running in a very see through midriff-bearing top, and obviously they didn't have bras in 800,000 AD or whatever it was. It's like Baywatch all over again! Also, I vaguely remember Guy Pearce from Neighbours - or maybe I don't, it's that long ago, and I was so young, I probably remember clips shown on TV later on. I've never seen him in a movie, never seen LA Confidential, or anything else he may have been in. All I know is, especially in the earlier scenes of the movie, and particularly in profile, he looks like an ape! His whole face seems to jut forward, and gives a likeness of an ape.<br /><br />I found this movie really sad, especially when he's trying to stop his girlfriend from being killed, you know it's gonna happen. But you know by just seeing Samantha, she's be the pretty chick in this, who'll mend his broken heart, or some love-sick nonsense.<br /><br />The start of this movie is based in 1899, yet one little thing I'm not very sure about - the fact he carries a locket necklace thing, with a COLOUR photo in it. In 1899? It could have been a painting I suppose, but not that small.<br /><br />Guy Pearce is brilliant in this. Although I much prefer him when he has shaggy hair and stubble, as it lessens the ape-like effect. And he just so happens to get his shirt off when he arrives in 800,000. Nothing wrong with that. He is awfully gaunt around the face though.<br /><br />Watch out for almost comedy performances from Mark Addy & Orlando Jones - both very funny, and should have had bigger roles.<br /><br />The reason why I mentioned the Mummy Returns earlier, was because the Morlocks characters, created by Stan Winston, reminded me of bigger pygmies from Mummy Returns! They had the same facial shapes and everything. Although I did think they were cute! Not scary in the slightest.<br /><br />There's not many extras on this, considering what they could have possibly done with it. There were three trailers (teaser, theatrical & international), so I was in my element with those! There were also: a commentary by director, producer, editor and visual effects supervisor; deleted scenes; featurettes: \\"Creating The Time Machine\\", \\"Creating the Morlocks\\" and storyboards.<br /><br />I wish people would look at these films with comparing them to previous movies. It really doesn't give this terrific movie a chance. I enjoyed it. And that's all that matters.gh I much prefer him when he has shaggy hair and stubble, as it lessens the ape-like effect. And he just so happens to get his shirt off when he arrives in 800,000. Nothing wrong with that.

0451167716|5.0|OK, the rap I'd always heard was that Francis Ford Coppola took a lurid pulp epic and buffed it with wax and shoe polish till he turned it into a cinematic Faberge egg.  And... that's pretty much correct. <br /> <br />But that analogy also completely limits the novel \\"The Godfather,\\" which is so much better than I ever expected it to be. <br /> <br />Here's a better analogy: if the first two movies are perfectly constructed sonnets, Puzo's novel is a \\"Prufrock\\"-esque epic, a noir \\"Howl\\" that is basically just one wild story after story after story after story.  If you've seen the movie, you know the characters.  But this is kind of like walking into the film and getting to find out the backstory of everybody... and I mean EVERYBODY.  Much of the flashbacks that appear in \\"Godfather II\\" are here, too. <br /> <br />Puzo's style is way less restrained than Coppola's.  What Coppola hints at, Puzo raises right up into your nose and the experience is a different one than fans might be used to, but no less fascinating.   <br /> <br />Perhaps the only thing that really wore against me as I read it was the constant return to Don Corleone's purity of character and sense of purpose.  The word count devoted to boasts of the Don's superhuman shrewdness and his infalible power could form a novella.  They're like a drum that the author beats from Chapter One to \\"The End,\\" but eventually I realized that they constitute its heartbeat.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1400032717|5.0|I read this book for a class about using the arts to teach special education.  This is possibly the best book I've ever been assigned to read, and as an education major with a literature minor, I've slogged through a lot of reading.  It is tough to sum up this book in a review, if you've ever wondered what goes on in the mind of a child, especially an autistic one, this is the book to read.   <br /> <br />I was moved to tears; it is absolutely amazing.
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|Each track features Ray and one other artist. Unfortunately some of these artists' vocal styles (e.g., Elton John, James Taylor) are so far removed from Ray's that listening to them together just doesn't make sense.  <br />Tracks where the other vocalist comes from an R&B/Soul/Blues/Jazz background (e.g., Norah Jones, BB King), the tracks are VERY GOOD.  <br />I'd recommend going for some of Ray's older work.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|I loved this movie from the opening credits. It was great to watch, and Brad Pitt's depiction of Achilles could not have been better. I was raised on \\"The Iliad\\" by Homer. There are some innacuracies to the movie, however, it was those innacuracies that I was interested in the most. First, Achilles in the Trojan Horse; Achilles in the Epic Cycle (Pre-Iliad and Post Epic poems in which most no longer exist) is killed at the hand of Paris upon entering a gate of Troy by a poinsoned arrow directed by Apollo. However, here he is in the Trojan Horse. He ends up attempting to find his 'prize; Bresis, whom was given back to her uncle, King Priam of Troy. Now, Patroclus in the Iliad is not described as Acilles' cousin. However, if one investigates further (unlike the review written by someone who knows little: Garag84) Achilles is Patroclus' cousin. Hesiod, a contemporary of Homer, wrote some of the Homeric Hymns, and his translated works can be found through the Loeb Classical Library \\"Hesiod: Homeric Hymns, Epic Cycle, and Homerica.\\" He is the best resource we have other than the Iliad for the life of Achilles. Under a chapter called \\"Catalogues of Women and Eoiae\\" on fragment 61, it says: <br />            for Hesiod says that Menoetius the father of Patroclus, was a brother of Peleus [Achilles father] so that in that case they were first cousins. <br /> <br />Now, not many know of Hesiod, therefore I do not blame Garak84 for his depiction of Achilles if \\"The Iliad\\" was all that he read. I mainly wrote this review to set the record straight, and say that there are resources available that do in fact, refer to Patroclus as Achilles cousin. All in all, this was not meant to be a review of the movie, but rather a review of the character of Achilles portrayed by Brad Pitt.  <br /> <br />Also I might add, the Trojan Horse is not mentioned in \\"The Iliad\\" either, nor is the death of Achilles. In fact, we only know of Achilles' death through the Epic Cycle, or Medievil mythologyof Achilles, where he was stabbed by Paris, being betrayed believing he was joining the Tojan side if he could marry a Trojan woman.  <br /> <br />All in all, if one watches Troy and enjoys it, I highly recomend they read \\"The Iliad\\" which takes place during the 10th year of the war, and is the final days of Achilles and Hector. If one has already read this, then I push them to read fragment of the Epic Cycle, which give another view of Achilles. He battles the Amazon Warriors, kills a Queen, and falls in love with the dead body. He kills Memnon, who bring the Ethiopians to help Troy (found in framents of Aethiopis) and then meets his doom at the gates of Troy. It also discusses the Funeral Games of Achilles, and the suicide of Ajax. I believe that in order to know Brad Pitt's character, one must first learn of the great Achilles.
0694003611|5.0|My 15-month old daughter is thrilled each time she spies this book.  We started reading this to her after her first birthday, as we were choosing our new bedtime ritual.  She and I sit in the rocker and her father sits on the floor next to us and we alternate reading pages.  This book went over so well, that she began requesting I read it before naps too.   <br /> <br />Now she picks it up and \\"reads\\" it on her own, which is how we ended up needing a second copy.  She is pretty tough on her books, so she has her own torn and taped up copy and we have a fresh one for our pre-bedtime readings.
0060987464|5.0|This book is a very interesting and highly intelligent book.  While much of the info is already known by Marilyn's diehard fanbase, I believe the book does a great job of exposing Marilyn for he is, a person with a heart, to the general public that quickly judges and discredits him due to his clothing and appearance.   <br /> <br />This is a fascinating book that should be read by everyone who criticizes Manson.  You don't know what you're talking about until you read what he really has to say.
B00003CWTI|4.0|This odd and touching movie by Paul Thomas Anderson is a treat for anyone who is willing to give up three hours and apply themselves (yes, that is the word) to this at times disjointed, disturbing, and ultimately enlightening film.<br /><br />Acted by a score of extremely talented actors, some known and some not so well known, the movie is a series of scenes from the lives of several people.  They are all supposed to be connected by fate in some way, which is supposed to be revealed by the end.  A narration at the beginning of the film talks about strange coincidences and connections, alleging they are facts.  Let it be known that they are NOT facts, especially the most promoted one, the one about \\"the jumper\\" who was fatally shot as he fell past a window by his own mother aiming a gun at his father is pure fiction.<br /><br />There is dying, wealthy, elderly Earl Partridge (Jason Robards)and his young, beautiful wife (Julianne Moore).  Linda is clearly on the edge as she goes to hunt for liquid morphine for her husband.  Sensitive and caring nurse Phil Parma (Philip Seymour Hoffman) wants to grant his client's wish to see his estranged son, perverted toadboy extraordinaire Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), who has an empire in \\"self-help\\" for men to learn to \\"Seduce and Destroy\\" all the p***y they want.<br /><br />Then there is Irish cop Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly, looking for love as he whistles along his merry beat.  His annoying chatter belies a sincere and kind heart, and he meets Claudia Gator (Melora Walters) on a noise disturbance call to her apartment.  He asks her on a date as she is snorting cocaine behind his back.  Claudia's father is famous game show host Jimmy Gator.  Jimmy is dying, but his daughter refuses to see or speak to him.  Jimmy is hosting a show called \\"What Do Kids Know?\\" and boy genius Stanley (Jeremy Blackman) is going to make or break his father's fortune on the show.<br /><br />Former 1960's quiz show kid genius Donnie (William H. Macy) is having a nervous breakdown as he is fired from his job at Solomon Solomon (Alfred Molina) furniture store.  In fact, most of these characters have a nervous breakdown of some kind.  The story is riveting.  There are many more amazing and enjoyable characters, literally too many to mention here, although I would like to.<br /><br />At some point in Magnolia, you will quietly break down and cry.  It is a different point for each viewer.  It is just that kind of movie, the kind that can be a cathartic experience.<br /><br />I do have a few gripes about Magnolia.  One of the best acted and most gripping scenes at the beginning is never followed up on!  And toward the end of the film, a surreal, post-modernist event unrelated to anything in the film, unexplainable and unexplained, distracted from the brilliant scenes before. I feel this was personal on the part of P.T. Anderson, who wrote, directed, and co-produced Magnolia.  It lent NOTHING to the film.illiam H.

B000003TA4|1.0|went to a megadeth show on monday. afterwards the first thing that came to my mind is \\"how the heck do millions of people love this album over ANYthing megadeth has released\\"?    megadeth is awesome live and yet they have emotion as well. nirvana , \\"i heard\\", was the most boring (...). why do people always praise the dead mans work? nobody over high school age likes nirvana. the \\"true\\" grunge fans of the early 90s moved on.    nirvana gave grunge a bad name and it gave rock a downfall. alice in chains, pearl jam, and soundgarden are talented bands.    anyways. listen to megadeth, go see them live, then tell me if you feel the same about this crappy band afterwards.    yes nirvana was influencial, to crap like green day offspring and creed....... and the rest of the crappy MTV no talented bands
0316926345|5.0|Brideshead Revisited is not for everyone. Evely Waugh focuses on what he thinks is important, and he doesn't particularly care if the reader doesn't agree with him. He is also utterly unapologetic about involving things like sin, morality, and God that are looked down upon by modern critics. That is what makes him great as an author. <br />The true key to this novel is the quote from G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown mysteries that is mentioned. The one where Father Brown talks about bringing someone back by a twitch upon the thread. An invisible thread long enough to let someone go to the ends of the world, and still bring him back. That, of course, is what God does in this novel. As Evelyn Waugh said, this novel is about the operation of Divine Grace upon a disparate group of individuals. And so the alcoholic Sebastian, the self-indulgent Julia, and the agnostic Charles are all brought back to God in the end. <br />It is the effects of time that make this novel so profoundly moving for me. Charles goes for so many years without even thinking of his time at Brideshead, and then one brief meeting with Julia brings it all back to him. And he realizes that nothing he has done in his life since then has been of any real value compared to it. That seems very like life to me, where things you barely noticed or didn't understand later become your most important memories. <br />It is true that Waugh tends to be overly snobbish about the aristocracy in England. We really must wonder if their passing away was such a bad thing. But he still paints a profound picture of England before World War II, as well as giving us unforgettable characters. This is truly a book worth reading.
B00000272N|5.0|Yet thousands of bands today take credit for what alice in chains made. staind, creed, bush... and thousands of other bands watered down their sound and took out the skill and emotion.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This album is by far the worst album in my collection... IN THE ZONE is just a horrible cd all around... I was a huge britney fan for years.'...baby one more time' may be her next worst because it was way to bubbly, 'oops...i did it again' her best effort to date, 'britney' is edgier and one of the best albums in my collections.   <br /> <br />IN THE ZONE has the worst songs ever. 'me against the music' f/ madonna (the worst song ever), 'breathe on me', 'shadow', 'everytime', and 'touch of my hand' did not need to be released at all... the way she is singing nowadays is just terrible (unlike the beginning when she had more depth in her voice).  i told people about smoking and what it does to your voice. <br /> <br />Well the reason i gave this LP a 2 stars is because of one song: \\"TOXIC\\" this is her best single to date... this is the britney i loved from the first glimpse.   <br /> <br />'don't hang up' (bonus track), 'showdown', 'outrageous', and  'i got that boom boom' w/ Ying Yang twins are the best songs on the LP...  <br /> <br />if you are a hardcore brit fan then buy this LP but you will not be amazed at all...
B000002GK1|4.0|Many people hear the word \\"grunge' and think oh no untalented depressed losers like Nirvana. I was that way until i listened to alice in chains, pearl jam, and soundgarden. Grunge is a good genre but like other genres their has to be 1 band who gives it a bad name. Nirvana is so over rated, meanwhile bands liek AIC , SG, and PJ get no credit whatesoever. great album
B000267JQK|5.0|Seether is a Real Band. There is no filler on this Album. Seether sounds like the kind of band who puts their heart into their songs, every song. There isnt a single bad song on this Cd. Sure, some arent as good as others, but I definately would never skip through a Seether song.<br /><br />Gasoline -10/10- A Great Song. Very Hard, Very Catchy all at once. The Lyrics could creep out the weak of heart, but us hardcore people dont mind a lil blood every now and then. Terrific song, probably my Favorite Seether Song.<br /><br />69 Tea -8/10- A Good Song. Good, as in comparison to other Seether songs on this CD. If it was on a Soundtrack or whatever, it would be the best song on there, but it simply cannot compare to the better songs on the CD, and for that reason it's an 8. And An 8 doesnt make it a bad song, I still like this song alot.<br /><br />Fine Again -10/10- I believe this was their first single, if Im not mistaken which is possible I Am. I first heard this song and thought it was nice, but I'd pass over it. But the more I Heard it, the more It grew on me. Fantastic Song, wonderful.<br /><br />Needles -8/10- A Very Hard Song by Seether. The Lyrics lack a certain pizzazz that most Seether songs are, but this isnt a song to take too lightly. I Think its a good song when you're in the mood to rip someones head off.<br /><br />Driven Under -10/10- Sheer Genius. I cant help but to just love this song. A Slower song by Seether, but that doesnt make it any less amazing. The Lyrics are dead-on and honest, but leave room for interpretation, which is a good thing. This song can mean so many things to so many people, and still be just as amazing. My Second Favorite Song On the CD Probably.<br /><br />Pride -8/10- My Friend Heather loves this Song. It's not my favorite Seether Song, but definately worth a listen.<br /><br />Sympathetic -7/10- Something is lacking. If there was one filler track, it'd be this one. But considering there is 20 Tracks, I dont expect any filler. If I were to skip a song, it'd be this one.<br /><br />Your Bore -8/10- Pretty Bland, and cut from the crop of Seether songs. But nothing is surprisingly really wrong with this song. It's Solid, it's enjoyable, and singable. Not a song I would skip over.<br /><br />Fade Away -10/10- A Slow Seether Song. But powerful none-the-less. It doesnt seem quite like a Ballad, but it may just be Seether's one attempt at a ballad. The Lyrics arent cutting too deep, but they do gleam emotion.<br /><br />Pig -9/10- A Harder song like Gasoline. Sorta makes me wanna play Air Guitar everytime I listen to it. It has a beautiful mix of slower and harder parts, which I think Seether pulls off very well, and this song is a very good example of it.<br /><br />FXXK It -10/10- Wow, what can I Say. It's an amazing song. Surprisingly Hard, and Slow. This plays Seether songs very well if you know what I mean, this song is what Seether does best. My Number Three Favorite song, but it's a good contender for number two. I listen to this Track all the way through, everytime I Hear it. It's so aggressive, and during the Versus, so passive/aggrisive that it makes the Extremely Hard Chorus even Harder sounding.<br /><br />Broken -10/10- The original version of Broken without Amy Lee. This was on Disclaimer I, and the verison with Amy Lee wasnt. Metal fans say that Amy Lee ruined it, and they love this version better. Frankly, I could listen to either one, and love it just the same.<br /><br />Sold Me -7/10- A Very Hard Song, but Seether doesnt seem to pull it off too well in comparison with all their others. It sounds sort of Nirvana-esque on the Drumming, which is a nice change of sort, but just not Seether's complete style. I'd skip this one.<br /><br />Cigarettes -7/10- Cigarettes are mini-cigars. Seriously, look at the name... Cigar-ettes. Isnt that crazy? Anyway. Not my favorite song, but Im sure somebody out there would like it. I like it, just in comparison with the other awesome songs, itgets a Seven.<br /><br />Love Her -9/10- Alright, now at this Track on the CD, Seether starts kicking it back into gear and doing what they do best. Emotional Music. Seether is better than Staind, because Seether is more real. Staind is too \\"Parents Suck I Hate Them\\" which is aggrivating after a long while, but Seether is more into Love Relationships.<br /><br />Take Me Away -9/10- Yes, yes. (claps) Acoustic sounds very good with Seether's Style. Im surprised more songs arent Acoustic. (wipes tear) Just lovely.<br /><br />Got It Made -8/10- Something is missing from this song, I cant exactly put my finger on it. Like, they couldve made it better somehow, someway. And all I can think about is ways to improve this song everytime I hear it. But it gets an 8 because all my other friends seem to enjoy this song and find nothing wrong with it.<br /><br />Out Of My Way -9/10- Interesting change of pace for Seether. Sounds like they tried to do pop-rock while keeping their usual Grunge-ish sound. Surprisingly they pulled it off quite well.<br /><br />Hang On -8/10- Sounds like most of other Seether songs. But it's not as good. Which isnt a bad thing ,I'd still not skip this track. It's just repetitive up to this point, mabey if it was earlier in the CD it would sound better.<br /><br />Broken Amy Lee -10/10- Like I said, some people hate this version, saying that Amy Lee ruined it. And I dont like Evanescence, I truly dont. Im an Avid-Evan hater. But I dont think she ruined this song. It was a great song without her, and a great song with her. She just added a new level to it, which doesnt take away from it. But she doesnt really ADD anything to it except her voice.h the other awesome songs, it gets a Seven. <br /> <br />Love Her -9/10- Alright, now at this Track on the CD, Seether starts kicking it back into gear and doing what they do best.

B00005O3VC|5.0|this is way funnier then the other 2 i laugh all the way through it's great buy it ......
B00004U8H4|3.0|Now I have to say that when I first saw this movie (on opening day) I saw it for two reasons. One was I love Chritian Bale. And the other was for Brett Easton Ellis. Although at the time I hadnt read this book, I had only read \\"Less than Zero\\" and that was close to ten years earlier. <br />First I will review the movie to people who have not read the book and then I will review it to those who have. <br /> <br />This is basically a movie about a serial killer. Although this is a bit different. The killer happens to be a rich, young, good looking wallstreet executive. This is also a black comedy, with some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear. It is also a period movie with meticulous details to the mid to late 1980's. <br /> <br />When I left the movie I was confused. Did he kill all those people? Was it only his imagination? Was it a comment on how we all have homicidal thoughts or immoral thoughts but we dont act on them? What was going on????? Well when I had only seen the movie my assumption was that he did not kill anyone. It was all a sick fantasy and he was just crazy, but not a killer. After reading the book I have completely changed my mind. Because there are too many things left out of the movie that if they were in it I would have though otherwise.  <br /> <br />Now there are some moments in the book which I feel are key to the story that never made it in the movie. One of them was his meeting with his ex-girlfriend. This is one of the few times we see Patrick as close to human. He is nervous, sweaty and intimidated by this woman. Which also has the best \\"twist\\" of the book with her new boyfriend being the head chef at \\"Dorsia\\", that illusive and chic resteraunt he can never get a reservation for.  <br /> <br />There are moments in the movie where the dialogue is dead on and ripped straight from the book, which I love. But most of the other times the dialogue is borrowed from one charachter and given to another. The scenes are blended into eachother forwhatever reason and so much is left out. The movie is by far less graphic. And it also moves too quickly. I believe the book takes place over an almost two year period where the movie is in about a 6 month stretch of time. <br /> <br />Also in the book I dont think anything bad happens for nearly 100 pages or so. But in the movie in the first 5 minutes he makes a comment to a waitress about killing her. That buildup in the book was really important. You knew he would snap, but it was taking a long time to build everything.  <br /> <br />Also there is the detective that I have a problem with. In the book he is young, attractive and dresses as well as Patrick. In the movie he is played by a much older and less attractive Willem Defoe. <br /> <br />Also the realtionship with his secretary is totally stripped down to bare bones and doesnt get anywhere near what it is in the book. I really disliked that.  <br /> <br />If your a fan of the book Im sure youve seen it. If you havent it's worth it to watch anyway even with all it's faults. It's a hard book and Im not sure if it could be made into a movie well. Although Id like to see someone try again. <br /> <br />If you havent read the book then you should still see the movie. If you like Christian Bale you will see him in a whole new light. He also pulled off a role that Im not sure anyone else could.  <br /> <br />I gave it a 3 star rating because of the issues I have with book/versus movie. But its still entertaining and a good converstation will happen after you watch it with someone.

0066620996|5.0|The point of this book isn't \\"Do this and you'll be successful\\"...Collins points out that there isn't a common set of steps to follow, but rather a common approach and commitment.

B00006FMAW|4.0|Okay everybody - calm down!  Yes there is a less than subtle jab at the classes here, but that's one better than most B-level horror flix.  Bottom line it is still a horror flick - and an engrossing and fun one at that. It is clever in spots, has some humor and really, the last 20 minutes of the film had me sitting there incredulous.  I think  that means it did it's job! A weird little trip.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie was extremely entertaining.  Even if some of the facts were twisted it's still necessary to watch this to get an idea of what a baboon of of president we have in office.  The footage of George Dubya was enough to keep me from voting for him on Tuesday.  If you're looking for something that will inform you about who to vote for this coming election, turn to Farenheit 9/11.  There was plenty of footage of Mr. Dubya making an ass out of himself in a way that other presidents have not seemed to achieve.  For those of you conservatives who listen to Rush Limbaugh, this movie is no different than what he does.  If you are willing to digest all the false garbage that the drug addict Limbaugh feeds you, then digest some liberal garbage for once.  They say a healthy diet consists of all the political food groups.

All players get equal space to solo, including Bobby Hutcherson. He is great all around, but my favourite moment is Freddie Hubbard solo on \\"catta', this might be my favourite all time solo of him. This one deserves to be called a Blue Note classic indeed.
068987474X|5.0|Okay, so I had just been given the heave-ho by a guy i was dating for only a month.  Everything was great and then he dropped the bomb on me that \\"he wanted to concentrate on his career.\\"  I was hurt, I'll admit it.

So, put down what you're doing, go to the bookstore or order it online right this minute.  Even if you're in a relationship, this will give you pointers to keep that relationship going the way you want it to.

B00031TXBI|5.0|None of the songs are boring, they all are great pieces of work/music by one of the best guitarists ever.  <br />If you are new to Frusciante, get Shadows Collide and TO Record Only Water for 10 days. There are some amazing solos on TROWF10D's. I would recommend all Frusciantes albums although Niandra  is definitely the most raw, but the guitar work is superb. <br />In a day where a lot of music sounds the same, John Frusciante stands out.  <br />I really like track 1, 3 and 6,7 the best. But all are great, those are personally preferences.. <br />Get this cd, you wont regret it!!
0694003611|5.0|I read all the reviews and I purchased it for my two girls ages 4 and 2. They absolutely love this book, they ask for it all the time for their bedtime story. It is simple enough that they try to read it themselves. Would highy recommend!
B00006BTCA|4.0|It's not to hard to tell upon first listen that Interpol's members like to wear a lot of black.  However, the music on Turn On The Bright Lights casts a black hue of dark charisma and earnest longing, rather than one of gloomy and gothic self-deprecation.  The music within is angular, edgy, and often aggressive, abound with enigmatic and oblique lyrics that leave the listener guessing as to what exactly is being sung about.     \\"Untitled\\" begins the album with stabs of minor key guitar and eventually gives way to the galloping \\"PDA\\" with plenty of \\"stop and go\\" angst. Yet, the real jewels on this album seem to be the ones of less emphatic tempos, such as the gorgeous and entrancing \\"NYC\\" with it's dreamy resonance and lovelorn vocals. Obviously, this quartet incorporates shades of the legendary post-punk outfit Joy Division, but where Ian Curtis often sounded doomed, Interpol always sounds as if their main goal is to keep reaching for the light.  A strong and stunningly exquisite debut.
B0002DB52M|5.0|This is not a short movie, nor is it a glib movie.  It's not easy to watch either.  It is  a well-acted, well-written, beautifully staged movie.  <br />The fragility of Grace, the stupid condescension and arrogance of Tom and the thoughtless sheeplike behaviour of the townsfolk are so well portrayed that despite the minimal set, the viewer is pulled right into this mean old town. <br />This is not an anti-American movie. The fact that it has been called so says more about America than it does about the film.  This movie is a global allegory for greed, fear and ignorance. <br /> <br /> ...and you gotta love the ending!!!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Okay, so what?! I've heard countless people harp on how listening to this album is just like listening to This is It and how the lack of a \\"new sound\\" or \\"new direction\\" makes this album less than stellar. Well, to that I say \\"Nonsense!\\" On the contrary, Room On Fire is just what the doctor ordered. This album is just different enough than it's predecessor, albeit not \\"dramatically\\" different.     This LP preaches the same ol' rock n' roll style and flavor that the NYC boys nailed the first time around including great songs, great hooks, plenty o' style, off the cuff sexiness, and a deliciously indifferent \\"To Cool to Care\\" attitude.   Never shy about boasting their sources, all the tricks of the trade from the original masters such as The Velvet Underground, Television, and Blondie are prominently exploited. \\"Reptilla\\" plods along with plenty of sassiness to spare, whereas \\"12:51\\" makes no bones about being peppy, cheery, and unflinchingly \\"poppy.\\" Again, the band lingers into faux reggae territory with gems such as \\"Under Control\\" and tackles syrupy 70's rock with an edge on the superb \\"The End Has No End.\\" If the formula works (Ramones anyone?), why not use it again and again? The Strokes once again get it right, proving that Rock n' Roll ain't about how hard it is to play, but how good it makes you feel.
B00005J6T1|4.0|Madonna's first album remains a classic and it still sounds fresh today, yet strangely enough its successors, 'Like A Virgin' and 'True Blue' have not aged as well.   <br /> <br />Madonna's debut was plugged into the club sounds of the early 80's which by then was a mix of funk/disco/New Wave/punk.  Madonna threw in a little pop and out came this gem.  <br /> <br />The hits are all here in remastered form, including 'Holiday', 'Lucky Star' and 'Borderline'.  But the album also features club hits including the seductive 'Physical Attraction', 'Everybody' and simply one of Madonna's best singles, 'Burning Up' a rare rock tune from Madge.  It's too bad she didn't do more songs like this because this one really rocks! <br /> <br />There are some bonus remixes but it would have been nicer to have some outtakes or unreleased tracks, if any.   <br /> <br />But I recommend this album, particularly if you only are familiar with Madonna's 90's material.  Give the early stuff a try!
B0002NRRAG|4.0|If it hadn't been 8 years between albums, would Madeline be mentioned in the breath as Norah Jones? She certainly is equally as talented and she has that Billie Holliday thing going for her. She truly shines on covers by Leonard Cohen(Dance Me To The End of Love) and Bob Dylan(You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go)and adds some of her own stuff as well as tracks by W.C. Handy and the late Elliott Smith. I have just one minor complaint about this album. The arrangements don't add to the music and the album as a whole. They sometimes seem to act as merely sweetener for Madeline's voice. That could be the fault of Larry Klein, though. Recommended for Norah Jones, Diana Krall and Julia Fordham fans.
B000002JR8|5.0|This is by far Pantera's best album. Although there is nothing wrong with Cowboys, Vulgar and Trendkill this is just a touch better and I honestly don think that there is an album or that you could make an album better than this. There are no fillers on this baby. Pantera set out to make the heaviest, hardest, fastest, kick ass record they could make and boy did they exceed expectations. The opening track strength beyond strength sets the tone for the album and honestly there is not one bad song on this album. Rates in my Top 5 albums of all time (See List). Every Track Stands out. The album closes with a Black Sabbath cover of Planet Caravan a little bit softer that the rest of the album but perfectly positioned at the end of the album which will bring u down from the high that the other 11 tracks have created and allow u to mellow out before u listen to it again. Must have. Do yourself a favour and go and by this album.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Admittedly, I bought this CD because I had listened to Avril's first album and was curious as to how she does in her latest auditory compilation.<br /><br />Her vocals were reminescent of Alanis Morissette right when Alanis succumbed to the \\"pop\\" disease, attempting to sound remorseful and longing at the same time but without any amount of soul in the lyrics.<br /><br />Girls that look like Avril are dime a dozen in Michigan. That's not a bad thing, but it just feels too normal.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|Collection of the majority of Guns n Roses music video's. There all here - Sweet Child, Welcome to the Jungle, PAradise City,Patience, November Rain, Garden of Eden. Strangely there are some notable ommissions - You COuld Be Mine, Knocking on Heavens Door, Civil War and It's so Easy for some reason are not on here. None the less it is stll a great DVD and a must have.
B00006JSS8|3.0|No definitive collection can cover <br />an entire span of this prolific <br />songwriter's career.  I strongly <br />urge serious fans to check out <br />his recently released box set. <br />It covers from beginning of <br />his rise to the current day. <br /> <br />Check out: <br />Stevie Wonder's  <br />\\"At Close of a Century\\" <br />is worth owning. <br /> <br />Listen to all the great <br />songs that inspired <br />3 generations!!!!
B000002HRE|1.0|This is a shocker. What were Metallica thinking. They have let outside influences influence this album. With the exception of The Memory Remains and Fuel (and even these 2 songs aren't that good)this album is shocking. I love every other MEtallica CD ever made but this really is bad. MEtallica - Do what u do best - Go back to making Good Hard Rock Records.
0671042858|5.0|The story of a child lost in the woods has been done before by many authors, but never with this much depth and bite to it.  For Trisha McFarlane isn't just dealing with how to build a fire or find berries to eat, she must stuggle to maintain her sanity and deal with the knowledge that something is stalking her.<br /><br />The more I read this book, the more I liked it.  I read it once and thought it was decent; I read it twice and thought it was spectacular.  The second time I read it I looked past all the references about the \\"sub-audible\\" and looked at the extremely well-developed character of Trisha.  I realized that the fact that she listens to the broadcasts of the Red Sox is not a ham-handed attempt for Red Sox fan King to worm his allegiance into a story, but Trisha's only connection with the outside world and other humans.<br /><br />There are plenty of the traditional elements to a \\"child lost in the woods\\" story; obviously Tina is going to have to find food, water, and a way back to humanity, but it is the psychological and horror elements that make the story soar.  Tina's growing detachment with reality is perfectly depicted, as is her growing knowledge that not only is there a creature stalking her...but it is no creature known to man.  A good story well told, I can't imagine why it wasn't better received.  9/10
0316666343|1.0|The title of this book originally put me off (who in their right mind calls bones \\"lovely\\"?) but I finally decided to give it a try.  Susie's version of heaven was delightful.  That she could visit earth and stand next to the people she loved but couldn't help them with their problems was plausible.  But other things were not.  Why would the mother not attend the memorial service on the anniversary of her daughter's death?  Why would the mother take comfort in another man's arms when there was nothing to suggest that she was unhappy with her husband?  When the detective started to put two and two together about the murderer, why didn't he act on his suspicion?  This was left hanging.  I know there are no rules when writing a fantasy, but come on, some things have to be credible.  It disgusted me that the murderer was going to get away with his crimes.  But when the author painted herself into a corner and realized something had to be done to the villian, she chose to dispose of him in a ridiculous and preposterous manner.
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|Celine is like my favorite singer. Normally I like everything she does, but this album just sucks. As I recall she said if she could not top her last album she would not realse one, well she did. She's not reaching her full potential as an artist and if she keeps this up, she going to be out like yesterday's trash.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Welcome to a time when the world was plagued by pirates.  Just when you thought that 2004 was horrible, check out the Mission.  You are in the 1700s, the expansive raw beauty of Brazil is set before you in vast cinematographic displays layered with Ennio Morricone's entrancing score.  The tragic history of the era provokes you to look elsewhere for sanctuary, so you become engrossed in the scenery, the background orchestration when DeNiro compels you to take notice of the drama unfolding and Jeremy Irons as a Jesuit priest reminds us that we all can become victims of false intelligence.  This is made clear late in the movie when we learn that all the powers that be are conspiring against us all - the elements, the church, the government, the media (I threw that one in, sorry) and we have been duped into believing the wrong things.  We are confronted with the age old human paradox:  do we change, fight to correct wrong, or passively choose to die?  At the end of the movie you are jolted back to 2004 on the eve of an election.... What will you do?
B00006LLNV|4.0|A previous review was made claiming the singers were not \\"professional\\" singers however the vocals were done by several very seasoned and accomplished Mexican artists.  Of these artists I must pinpoint Chavela Vargas and Lila Downs, these two artists are absolutely inspiring and bring so many feelings and emotions through their songs.  Beautiful, pride-enducing.  Love it!  :)
B0006A9FKA|5.0|SHAUN OF THE DEAD takes its place in my exhaulted list of all-time zombie greats. It's a classic that I'll be watching for years to come! And if you've dragged your girlfriend to too many horror films in the past and she doesn't believe you anymore when you say, \\"but it's really kinda like a chick flick, it's got romance,\\" you should have a better shot getting her to see SHAUN OF THE DEAD...even if she cringes at the \\"Z\\"-word. She just might thank you afterwords!
B000000H7I|5.0|Geez, what a pleasure. Is Suffocation. The Grandfathers of GOOD Technical Death Metal. By many considered their best and my personal favorite. Guitar Solos that kill the speakers. Heavy AS HELL Riffs. A drummer that kicks an ALMOST INFINITE amount of a$$ and a vocalist that has one of the best growlings in the business. Suffocation delivers top quality music (You guys know that anyway. If you are here, you are not one of those ignorant douche bags that can't come up with something other than a lame \\"This is just noise\\" comment) <br />This is the stuff that must be played in the cars. This is the stuff that must be played in the radio. I don't know you, but any time I can, I deliver some Suffocation into the ears of my friends (Although I stop when they began praying for their lives). <br />They have said a bunch of times but I gotta say it too. <br />IS SUFFOCATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
630521610X|4.0|Scream is one of the most clever horror movies to burst onto the screen in years.Unlike other horror movies, Scream manages to be extremely terrifying at some points, and delightfully clever at others, as the characters make subtle references to past horror classics. Our story begins at the Becker residence, where Casey Becker is getting ready to watch a scary movie. Until she suddenly gets a call from an unknown person inquiring her favorite scary movie. After having a brief talk about horror movies, our unseen character lets it slip that he is watching Casey, and is someone near the house. This is where the true terror begins, and the story begins to get interesting. The killer now knowing that Casey knows he is near threatens to gut her boyfriend [who he has captive on the back deck] unless she can answer a question about a scary movie correctly. Upon getting the question wrong, her boyfriend is gutted, and the killer begins pursuing Casey. The next day, we meet up with Sydney Campbell, a friend of Casey's who is crushed by the murder.It doesn't help that Sydney is recently mourning over the loss of her mother a year ago, and her boyfriend Billy might just be the murderer. With a killer on the loose in the town, some of the high schoolers decide to have a party to celebrate that they don't have school because of the deaths. With rampant partying going on, no one seems to notice that the killer is among them, killing them off. It all boils down to the final fight between Sydney and the killer, who has his own reasons for wanting Sydney dead. Although many may be turned off by the explicit violence and blood, and others may not like it just for the fact that it's a teen horror movie, that's no reason to miss out on one of the scariest movies ever.   Body Count:8  Rated R, for strong horror violence,gore, and language  Best Death: Drew's death, or crushed by garage
B00003CXCT|1.0|It is so darn obvious that George Lucas made the new special editions for kids. The reason (I believe) Han shoots first is to show kids that it was in self defence, and that it's wrong for a good guy to shoot first and kill them if not in self defence.     The Jabba scene in ANH is WAY out of place. For one the ROTJ Jabba is far bigger, and remember when Luke said the Falcon was a piece of junk? Well now that we have viewed the Falcon before this scene, it won't have the same impact. There are many other stupid changes in ANH (Like when Han chases the Storm Troppers they go into a dead end, or well, they did, when they see hundreds of other Storm Troopers doing something.)    The Empire Strikes Back - despite being the worst of the original trilogy, has the less editing in it. The only parts that made me mad is taking out the \\"You're lucky you dont taste good R2\\" quote and the dialogue changed in the Vader/Emperor discussion. Other than that the changes were good.    The ROTJ has the worse editing done. The Jabba the Hut music scene - I won't even acknolwedge it's DVD existence. And you all here about Hayden appearing as a ghost at the end and the crappy little shop of horrors sarlacc pit, so I am going to stop rambling on.    Think about it, if one day Paul McCartney decided he did not like John Lennon's voice and decided to redub them all and destroyed all John Lennon (singing) CD's from existence, there would be a riot. Star Wars may have just as much as a punch in culture as the Beatles!
0062502182|1.0|Ok, I'm a bit too severe with a one star, it deserves, maybe, a star and a half. Why? Read on. <br /> <br /> 1) I'm perfectly aware that it is a fable. A fable is simple, not simplistic, or it should. <br /> <br /> However, for this book - the \\"message\\" or \\"moral\\" is obvious, and predictable; the symbolism involved thin and cliche, and the style of writing poor, and annoying with it's constant repetitions (sometimes it sounds like a language learning tape \\"personal legend\\" is said infinite times, till imprinted forever on your cortex)  <br /> <br /> The book also has some convoluted contradicting messages, of the \\"religious soup\\" kind. It probably suited perfectly for an audience that mixes Christianity, with the hole \\"God is one, just has diffrent names\\" type of philosophies, with a good deal of superstition, and folk \\"knowledge\\". The God switches from Yehovah to Allah, and apparently this God caters to Christians, muslims,  fortune-tellers and 200 year old alchemists who possess the philosopher's stone alike. <br />  You get from passages ripped from the bible to \\"omens\\" to determinism, to prophecies. Either it's an attempt at globalism, or it's trying to cover all grounds, so it has enough success in diffrent countries. Take a pick. <br /> <br />  The philosophy involved is not a pearl of moral wisdom. The \\"universe conspiring for your dream\\" is the same old egocentric and antropocentric plague of human thought that has been with us for neons. \\"there are no coincidences\\" and \\"everything has a purpose nad meaning\\" is just as typically human, in the negative way. <br /> <br /> It also falls in the trap of One-ism. Every life has a - Dream. Heaven forbid that some people have two, or that they sacrifice a dream for things like family or love. I also didn't appreciate that the only female in the book had such an 18 century typical \\"personal legend\\", that being her husband. And the \\"I'm a woman, I sit and wait for my husband to go on a wild goose chase.\\" <br /> <br/> There is nothing profoundly inspirational, life-changing, or enlightning in it, except for someone who probably never touched a philosophy book, or read any good literature of the kind. <br /> <br /> To recommend a few in exchange - Exupery's The little prince (for the same intended, but in this case achieved, magic, and inspirating story). Voltaire's stories are funny and witty, and use a similar type of pretext (a voyage, adventures etc.) for very subtle philosophical ideas. I'd add A thousand and one nights, just because they're thousand year old stories, written by actual desert people.   <br />   <br /> And remember, listen to your heart, for arhythmy is bad for your  health :P!
0156027321|5.0|I bought this book while browsing through a book store.  I got hooked from the description on the back cover.  Then, as I always do, I read Amazon book reviews before reading the book.  Several reviewers claimed to have been bored by the pages, and pages, and pages of description devoted to the main character being adrift at sea.<br /><br />I have a differing view in that I did not find it boring at all.  I found that I kept reading and the book held my interest from start to finish.<br /><br />To top it all off, the ending was so unexpected and surprising that it made me want to read the book again.  I recommend this book highly, but I would not recommend it to my mother or any others with weak stomachs.

B0000025T6|5.0|\\"Everything dies baby, that's a fact. But maybe everything that dies some day comes back.\\"<br /><br />Our journey is one of hard traveling--year in, year out. Bruce Springsteen's album Nebraska is filled with haunting and sometimes beautiful snap-shots of people who've come to the end of their rope. It is possibly his greatest recording (its either this one or its echo of a decade later: The Ghost of Tom Joad).<br /><br />Each song on Nebraska paints a portrait or a chracter sketch of an individual facing some kind of crux in their life. Each song is a unique story told in varying narrative voices. Each speaks to the triumphs and the humiliations that make us human.<br /><br />The strength of Nebraska is that the narrators of the songs are allowed to tell their own tales, there is no imputed right or wrong from the song-writer. Much like short-stories that grab you with the humanity and reality of the main character, these songs bring you into their world rather than merely telling you about them. In the drudgery, hard labor, and ever-present shadow of despair we meet people very much like us.<br /><br />If I sound foolish in what I am about to say, I beg your foriveness and ask you to listen to a fool just a little while longer: despite the storm clouds that gather in these songs, I see them as great testimonies to the power of hope. Much like the Badlands mentioned in the title track (which I had the privilege of visiting this summer), the darkness of life, the bleakness that sometimes echos deep within us, suggest to me a the possibility--hell--the PROBABILITY of better days and better things. Hope takes some faith and both (hope and faith), without being rooted in love, are worthless.<br /><br />But hope, like faith and love, are the only things that will never fail--even in the deepest darkness of the shadow of despair.<br /><br />I give Nebraska my full recommendation.

B00004TH7Z|4.0|I just about gave up on Iron Maiden after Virtual XI. To me it seemed the band was going to go on, but with new members, and living off the name of the band alone. Even when I heard Dickinson had rejoined the band for the new album I didn't hold out much hope, more often than not a band will try to cash in one last time with a \\"reunion\\" album before packing it in for good. Thankfully, I was wrong on all counts! Iron Maiden is back in top form with Brave New World, any doubts were put to rest with the opening chords of Whicker Man. Iron Maiden has created on of the best metal albums to hit the new millenium with Brave New World. The songs are all well written, and each tune drips with what fans like about the band. Steve Harris' bass drives this collection of songs, and the triple threat of Janick Gers, Dave Murray and Adrian Smith back on guitar give Brave New World an added dimension, and a much fuller sound. Nicko McBrain is phenominal as always, and the rhythms incorporated throughout Brave New World will have you slapping your steering wheel keeping the beat. And with Bruce Dickinson once again fronting the band....you just can't go wrong. There are some added elements to Brave New World that enhance the classic Maiden sound this time out, notably keyboards played by Harris and some orchestration on a couple tracks. In this day and age when heavy metal is ruled by bands like Slipknot and Pantera, it's refreshing to hear a band like Maiden that can still compose, and perform good music instead of simply screaming incoherantly over what amounts to white noise. Brave New World might not be regarded in the same vein as Powerslave or Number of the Beast, but it's the best Maiden album to hit the shelves since Somewhere in Time and well worth adding to you cd collection.
0735619670|3.0|Having read the first edition many years ago, it was the only book I have ever read a chapter before bed only to think \\"maybe I will read another...and another..then go to bed\\", I purchased the second edition recently.  Maybe because I have read so many other books since then that this edition failed to grasp my interest as much.<br /><br />The content has changed considerably, as has some of his opinions of what is considered \\"best practice\\".  Some of the \\"new\\" ones are things I have been doing for years and disagreed with him at the time.  Unfortunately, many of the conventions he has adopted have been tainted by the \\"Java\\" world, in particular naming, formatting and commenting conventions.  Some of these points are only religious in nature, but some, he devotes just two lines to Hungarian notation (the first edition was filled with the virtues of it), he dismisses as out of fashion and continues on his new course.  The examples are filled with names which would have been easier to use a prefix than call them all \\"colourX\\", he has just adopted a new notation that consists of words rather than abreviations but conveys no further information about the variable.  Mind you, he still uses variables called \\"i\\" - this is Hungarian in it's simplest form Steve!<br /><br />Some of his formatting, particularly wrapping onto a second line, makes code become almost impossible to understand by cluttering the left side of an assignment with data from the right side.  He then makes a point about making code clear to the eye...<br /><br />The book is filled with quotes and results from studies done by many companies, I don't know the value of studies on code comprehensionability done in the 80's is that relevant to today, but he uses these to backup most of what he says.<br /><br />The book contains very comprehensive bibliographies at the end of each chapter and so is a great starting point, browsing through the lists I found many books which I have already read myself.  I have to question, with so many quotes and references from others, if this is truly an \\"original\\" work.  How many of his thoughts are his \\"own\\" and how many are just a regurgitation of others.<br /><br />Having said all this, it is still an excellent book that everyone who considers themselves a \\"programmer\\" should read.  Well done Steve, I will be waiting for the third edition...maybe you will find \\"best practices\\" lie somewhere between the first and second editions.f.

B000063DIH|3.0|When \\"Fear of the Dark\\" came out in the early 90's it came out to so little fanfare that as a Maiden fan, I didn't even know a new album had hit the shelves until a couple months after it's release. Of course I picked it up as soon as I heard about it, and maybe it's just that I have a soft spot for Maiden, but it was refreshing to hear new Maiden tracks amidst the onslaught of grunge at the time. The Seattle sound killed off most hair-metal bands, and pushed real metal bands like Iron Maiden onto the backburner. And while metal radio was full of Pearl Jams, and Alice in Chains, I was able to escape with \\"Fear of the Dark\\", \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and \\"Judas Be My Guide\\". There are a couple weak tracks found here, \\"Fear is the Key\\" and \\"Afraid to Shoot at Strangers\\", but overall this is a solid Maiden album. Nicko McBrain's drumming on \\"Childhood's End\\" is fantastic. I don't think McBrain's contributions to the band have ever fully been recognized, and \\"Fear of the Dark\\" features some of his best work. While this album may not be on par with \\"Powerslave\\" or \\"Somewhere in Time\\", it is a good solid Maiden album, and worth adding to your collection.

This book is eminently readable, funny, and human, and best of all requires no knowledge of calculus or particle physics to understand or enjoy.  <br /> <br />Richard Feynman was one of the truly great minds of the twentieth century, and his lectures are considered some of the most important works of hard science to date by the overwhelming number of physical scientists in the world. This book discusses physics in language accessible to most anyone, yet has an urbane sophistication and sense of humor about it that is able to entertain a wide variety of readers. I recommend it to anyone who wants to look inside the world of a genuine genius. Inside that world they will discover insights about science, music, societal values, the educational system, and much more, while simultaneously skewering pompous blowhards who feel superior to others due to education or upbringing.  <br /> <br />Truly Feynman was a genius for the masses; this is my favorite of his books, but I recommend them all.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I will begin by saying the good things.<br /><br />Great cast. The director had the great common sense to cast two of my favorite women, Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran (although Maran was skewered way too soon). Hugh Jackman is the right amount of charm and strength to pull off the character... and finally... it looks good. The special effects are fantastic.<br /><br />YET!! This movie... about VAMPIRES, FRANKENSTEIN, WEREWOLVES and DR. JEKYLL and MR. HYDE isn't even remotely REMOTELY scary. Not a sliver.<br /><br />Which is completely and squarely placed on the shoulders of Director Stephen Sommers. Which, and I could see it coming a mile away, also directed The Mummy, which also wasn't scary.<br /><br />And you know what... I don't think it was intended to be scary when they went into production... which makes it even worse.<br /><br />Before going to see this movie, I was completely aware of the downfall I would soon become fully aware of. The movie wouldn't be scary. It wouldn't be dark and risky. It would be a comedy with cool special effects.<br /><br />WHAT!! How can you pool the great monsters of our time and NOT KNOW YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MOVIE SOMEWHAT SCARY!<br /><br />Yet the Beckinsale/Maran factor drug me into the theatre and my preconceived notion was absolutely correct...<br /><br />Ho. Hum. If you like special effect popcorn movies. Don't like to be too mentally challenged when you're watching a movie and like a mild chuckle here and there, then this is your kind of movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when it comes to Dracula, Werewolf and Frankenstein... I wanted to be scared, wanted to be CHALLENGED and wanted to see something that I've never seen before.<br /><br />Well, that didn't happen.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is an amazing album.  I don't know if it is just the fact that it's a new CD or not, but I think this may be their best album yet.
B000002H33|5.0|One of the greatest and essential rock albums of all time, PERIOD! To me, all the Metallica albums are good, but none can hold a candle to this. Of all my favorite rock albums this is truly #1. I listened to it yesterday, since I haven't been listening to Metallica lately, and it reminded me of what truly great band this is. Or as James Hetfield would put it. (...). Metallica is my favorite band. Of course, there will always be people who love you or hate you. I guess it's that way with everyone. They weren't liked in the 80's, had a brief stint in the early 90's (many critics considered the Black Album to be the next flavor of the month). Then dispised in the late 90's. Now, in 2004 everyone hates them. Eh... you can't always have pickers be chosers.
0765301598|2.0|The long slide of this series into the literary toilet finally ended in a splash. I mostly enjoyed the first prequels, shortly before the time of \\"Dune\\". But these super-early prequels, thousands of years before \\"Dune\\", have started poorly and ended dreadfully. <br /> <br />The dialogue is dreadful. Compare it - and the writing in general - to the dense, subtle prose of Frank Herbert. No comparison. This is the kind of writing you expect from wannabe's, not established authors. <br /> <br />The plot developments are simply unbelievable. Almost every aspect of the later \\"Dune\\" mythology is the result of a stupid accident? Oh please. The different story lines do not all mesh well, except insofar as they represent lame attempts to establish \\"what comes later\\". Many story develops \\"just happen\\" with almost no logic or slow development. <br /> <br />Characterization - with a few exceptions, such as Vorian Atreides and Erasmus - is atrocious. Completely incredible is how/why Abulurd Harkonnen changes heart at the Battle of Corrin, resulting in the infamous \\"betrayal at the bridge\\" we hear so much about later. We can nuke billions but at the last critical moment we refuse to sacrifice 2 million humans? Not believable at all, given how the characters had hitherto developed. People make decisions that are almost random and completely incomprehensible. <br /> <br />There is an odd preoccupation with body parts and fluids and such along with the oddly overdrawn descriptions of people dying horribly and violently. The result is a cartoonish caricature that distracts more than it helps move the story. <br /> <br />Finally - notice how the story moves almost too quickly, a frantic pace, short stocatto conversations without emotion so that *suddenly* this happens, *suddenly* that decision is made - the final conquest of Corrin really only takes up a handful of pages. Wow. Wonder how it happened? These guys barely take the time to tell us. <br /> <br />I can't believe I spent goodmoney on the hardback edition. What a waste. Should have waited for the library copy.
B00063MBU8|4.0|Impressed by the first album?? Then you should love Still Not Getting Any. Like any album, it has its ups and downs, but thankfully, Simple Plan know how to entertain.<BR>1: Shut up! This is a very upbeat song, and is similar to material on the first album, enjoyable, but not repeatedly enjoyable. 3.5/5<BR>2: Welcome to My life: The first single off an album usually gets annoying after a while, but this is too good a song to get bored of! 5/5<BR>3: Perfect World: This is a prime example of Simple Plan's growing maturity.They talk about something real here, and is one of the best songs on the album. 5/5 a FAVOURITE!<BR>4: Thankyou: A song that grows on you after time. This is a dip in the album, and a song that can be skipped. 2.5/5<BR>5: Me against the World: At first i wasn't too keen on this song, but the chorus completly makes up for it. A great song, darker but better. 4.5/5<BR>6: Crazy: This song talks about girls wanting to be like modals, and pretty much why they think this is crazy lol. But a cute song, that is a lot more better than you first might think. The music is brilliant in this song. 4.5/5<BR>7: Jump: This has to be the worst song on the album, and i don't know whether its the fact that they're all repeatedly shouting Jump or not...but hey i know what the bloody song is called! an unpressive 2/5<BR>8:Everytime:For some reason, this song reminds me of christmas?! a slow tempo, and relaxed rocky ballad. 4/5<BR>9: Promises: Theres always a song you can never remember, and its this one. Still a good try though, 3.5/5<BR>10: One: I love this song! Its slow, and yet tis rocky! totally loving it! Again, i think the music behind it is great, and really makes the song better. 5/5 a FAVOURITE!<BR>11: Untitled: Now is this the name, or the fact that they were too lazy to make one up?You can figure that one out.This song is this albums 'perfect' and although simplistic,SP try to make it different with all those strings in the background, and it works on a level.Its a great song though,and gets in your head for ages. Just wish it was longer:( 5/5. a FAVOURITE!<br />Simple Plan rule!
B0000039QA|3.0|now i hate to diss this album because to me it's like disrespecting Biggie's last effort. Biggie was an ill MC, but he was also overrated too (which i'll mention why later). Onto this album review, this album would've been flawless such as ALL Eyez on Me if Puffy wasn't recorded on this record. His voice ad libs annoy me to def. Especially on tracks in which Biggie was telling a story. I am a person who doesn't believe in putting interludes or skits on a rap album unless its gonna be funny as hell, but he should've let the whole album be song after song. The pop tracks such as Hypnotize and some others aren't really all that entertaining just fillers. To me Ready to Die was a better album as far as lyrics (production sucked) this album was good for for production, and Biggie rhyming about his last days...but for some reason it sounds as if Bggie compromised on this LP. Now reason why Biggie is overrated: in comparison with 2pac, biggie would be second, because biggie rapped the same style every song...2pac changed flows on each album he rhymed on from 2pacalypse now to his last on Makaveli. Two, he only released two albums...and only on one he spit some attention-worthy lyrics. Three, i'ver heard better...hell listen to Canibus, Slick Rick...Biggie isn't the greatest, and 2pac wasn't either but 2pac i can is one of the greastest rappers in diff' aspects. Biggie was one of the greatest freestlylist though. 3 stars due to the fact he had pointless skits and for a 24 track album, I only heard four tracks that were raw.
B00009MECF|5.0|To those who have not experienced the world of hard core street drugs and the violent consuming grip they can have, I point to this movie as maybe the quintessential performance of an individual addict. Trainspotting and other movies may cover a drug, or a lifestyle better, but nothing captures the tragedy of an individual like DiCaprio's performance in Basketball Diaries.  The defining moment is DiCaprio, pounding on his mother's door, begging for $20 so that he can score just one more hit.  His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, huddles on the other side of the door, crying, and fighting the maternal instincts to help her son, when she knows he can not be helped.  The cry that Leo gives out, as he pulls his cap down over his face in frustration, a sixteen-year-old crying for his mommy, because it all hurts too much to cope.  That is the face of addiction.  DiCaprio's cry comes from his belly, the whiny tantrum cry of a four-year-old who just can't understand why he can't get his way.  And yet, underneath that, one gets the sensation of the turmoil and pain within his heart, and the ultimate sadness that eats away at him. <br />This movie introduced me to the beautiful and edgy work of Jim Carroll, the star of the latest Beat generation.  His story is so captivatingly told through the performance of DiCaprio.  However, the supporting cast is also spectacular.  Mark Wahlberg deliveres a great support perfomance, as a cohort in drug addiction, helping to supply pills, glue, heroin, and the like.   <br />Keep an eye out for an early performance by Michael Imperioli, of Sopranos fame, playing a teammate of DiCaprio and Wahlberg, who passes away during the film.  Yet one more devastating event in Carroll's life. <br />There are some stylistic choices made by the director that may not fit with some people, but they are only a minor detail in a very powerful and honest film.

B000002KB8|5.0|Let me tell you,the first time I heard this I was about 12 years old and it completely blew me away.  Now, 34 years later, I still have a soft spot for this recording, still listen to it occasionally, and feel that it is Black Sabbaths best album. At the time there was just nothing like it, and this total originality is what makes it such a classic. The albums that followed were great as well, but this one was first, and I guess that must be why I rate it a little higher.  You can say that heavy metal started here, but Black Sabbath did'nt know that at the time, they just played their music. Beyond classic.
0141301120|2.0|Roald Dahl was one of the most brilliant children's novelists of all time, and his masterpieces \\"Danny the Champion of the World,\\" \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" still stand up to repeated readings by kids and adults alike. \\"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator,\\" however, is best forgotten. Supposedly a sequel to \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" this one does not come up to the first book at all. This tends to be the case with many sequels, but this one even goes so far as to tarnish the original it follows, by veering what was a splendid story into a realm so absurd and outlandish that it loses the vital toehold on believable reality that made the first book so endearing, magic and all. The first chapter, entitled \\"Mr. Wonka Goes too far,\\" might be applied to this whole story, in which the author sends the characters (none of whom are as likeable as they were in the first book) into outer space to battle space aliens, and off to the White House to wrangle with the U.S. government, and other nonsense that has nothing to do with the first book and its accessible fun. I prefer to read \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" on its own and not to acknowledge that it even has a sequel. Kids may enjoy some of the silliness here, but few will remember it or treasure it like they will do with some of Dahl's other books.

B000255LNE|5.0|Plain and simple...this man has written some of the most beautiful and heart wrenching love songs and finally they are together in one set to enjoy. His love songs from the early 80's like \\"Don't Let him Steal Your Heart Away\\", \\"This Must Be Love\\" and \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy\\"(my personal favorite) are included in this set and are some of the best ballads he has ever written. They will surely be a treat to Phil's younger fans who will be hearing some of these songs for the very first time. Unfortunately, one of Phil's most heart breaking ballads \\"You Know What I Mean\\" did not make the set. I highly recommend this CD set to anyone who has found or lost love - there is sure to be a song here that will make you say to yourself... \\"That is EXACTLY how I feel!\\"
B0001MDP3G|4.0|***May have spoilers*** The previews can be deceiving and this movie proves it.  It comes across as an arty/historical movie but all it is is a romantic movie.  The narrative and performances fill in for a somewhat predictable storyline.  It may be a bit disappointing to people expecting a hardcore civil war movie but it keeps its promise to all those who went into it for the romance.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman have chemistry.  Renee Zellweger steals the show.<br /><br />Storyline:  Jude Law plays a man madly in love with Kidman who must keep his promise to return. He goes AWOL to keep his promise after three years of service to the Union.  Much of the movie captures the challenges he faces when finding his way back to his sweetheart.  The director has used Law's journey back to show the emotional mood and economical hardships of the people in a war stricken America.  On the other side in Cold Mountain, Zellweger transforms Kidman from a proper lady to a useful woman who can be self sufficient and not rely on a man to take care of her. Ending: you will guess it when you watch.<br /><br />Not such a bad watch to fill up a lazy evening.
B0002SROT0|4.0|Like everyone else who has reviewed this album, I loved Elliott Smith.  I was able to relate much more with him and the way he felt about things than most other artists.  I was able to sort through my own problems when I listened to his.  I feel cheated by his suicide and mourned over the useless waste of such an enormous talent.  Lastly, I have been waiting for this album for four years.    It's true:  I heard many of the same things about the album before it surfaced.  Talk of a double album.  A new \\"White album.\\"  Rumors of his best album.  If you don't fall sway to rumors like these that normally surround the release date of a prolific musician or band (anyone remember \\"Hail to the Thief\\" being the great return to \\"The Bends?\\"), you will probably not be let down by Elliott Smith's final album.  If you take the album song for song, it probably isn't one of his strongest.  That doesn't mean the songs are bad, but rather there is a rather apparent lack of obvious standouts or singles.  The album seems to mesh well to itself.  There are at least three or four songs that COULD be released as singles, however.  (I like the thought of \\"Pretty (Ugly Before),\\" \\"A Fond Farewell,\\" or \\"A Distorted Reality is Now a Necessity to be Free\\" being heard on the radio.)  The album as an entity proves to be just as strong as anything he has made.    Outside of all these things (which incidentally don't really mean much at all), it's just a nice way for fans to  feel some closure on the premature end to Elliott's life.  Some have said they don't feel as close to this album as others.  I can see that happening.  It may take a while to get used to the music from \\"Basement on a Hill.\\"  But, then, his death has taken a while to get used to, also.  Overall:  8 out of 10.
B000068UXF|5.0|The negative criticisms of some previous reviewers notwithstanding, this is a fantastic performance of a wondrous, magical opera, the last and perhaps best collaboration between Hugo von Hoffmannstahl  and Richard Strauss. Here the composer, surprisingly, returns to his earlier style (e.g. Salome, Elektra) with a huge orchestra and vast volume of sound, but at the same time combines it with quiet, chamber music sections. The overall effect is a balance between the two and the work remains fascinating and enchanting in spite of its length. The score is, of course, not expected to be fully comprehended at first hearing, but repeated listening will bring discovery and lots of enjoyment.<br /><br />  It is a great gift of technology today, the DVD, that such a production can be accessible to the public.<br /><br />  To begin with: Solti the conductor. It is quite obvious to anyone by now that he was one of the two greatest conductors (Karajan the other) of the latter half of the 20th century. Here we witness his greatness by watching him conduct, his intense concentration, his precise and elegant baton handling, his finger and eye movements giving almost imperceptible clues to his orchestra. He creates incredible orchestral effects with an economy of movements<br /><br />thereby preserving his energy (after all, he was over 75 years old at the time). Just watch him conduct the Interlude, the Descent onto Earth, in Act. I., (reminiscent of similar passage in the Rheingold), so exciting it is that it will hold you breathless.<br /><br />  The production itself is visually stunning with inspired set designs, strong images and beautiful colours - a feast to the eye.<br /><br />  The principals are to varying degrees quite exceptional. Eva Marton, the Hungarian born soprano is thoroughly inspired in the monstrously difficult role of Barak's wife although her voice is no longer in its prime. Her acting is uninhibited and riveting. Cheryl Studer, a highly accomplished dramatic soprano is also inspired and very sympathetic as the Empress. But Marjana Lipovsek (who, contrary to a previous reviewer, is very much alive!) is the most outstanding female singer in the production, as the Nurse.<br /><br />  Robert Hale, as Barak, creates a completely believable character and grows emotionally as the opera progresses. Even his voice gets stronger and stronger. Thomas Moser as the Emperor, unfortunately, is no match for Placido Domingo as his voice is comparatively under powered.  Bryn Terfel has a stentorian voice, promising a great career for him in years to come.<br /><br />It has to be mentioned that the previously released CD set on Decca, also with Solti, has marginally better singers , but I would not for a moment hesitate to get the DVD if you want to see this opera. It is also more economical: 2 DVD's  vs. 3 CD's.<br /><br />The set is neatly presented, booklet included. Interactive menus with a great many Decca DVD previews are available.<br /><br />A \\"must have\\" for all Strauss lovers.soprano is also inspired and very sympathetic as the Empress.

B0002YCVXI|5.0|Yo Yo Ma is a classical musician who seems to be able to cross over into other musical styles rather well. This may be due to the fact that he makes wise choices about what he performs. This collection of Ennio Morricone's film music is an excellent example of a crossover choice that is wisely made.<br /><br />The recording contains musical arrangements for some of Morricone's best known scores e.g. \\"The Mission,\\" \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" and \\"The Untouchables\\" as well as some of Morricone's lesser known scores. Each piece is arranged by Morricone and performed exquisitely by Yo Yo Ma. Morricone also conducts the Roma Sinfonietta Orchestra. Morricone's presence ensures that the music is as the composer intended, and Yo Yo Ma does not take unnecessary liberties while performing. This should come as a comfort to those of us who love the score to \\"The Mission\\" and cringe every time we hear words added to the theme in a rendition known as \\"Nulla Fantasia\\" performed by the likes of the Celtic Tenors and Charlotte Church. In other words, we have a new interpretation of Morricone's work, not a bastardization.<br /><br />It is perfect background music and is sure to bring joy to listeners for many years to come.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Kaufman's movies always do something intriguing with the psyche: Being John Malkovich addressed the implications and complications of finding a portal that would usher someone into John Malkovich's head; Adaptation addressed the way an author interweaves himself into a text and the way audiences assume the script accurately represents reality.  Eternal Sunshine has the same quality of script writing; I favor it above the others simply for stylistic reasons, but I recognize the expert craftsmanship. <br /> <br />Eternal Sunshine explores the supposed scenario where a company offers people te chance to erase someone from their memory.  The performances by all actors involved are superb: for example, Jim Carrey is in the movie but from the very openning scene I only ever think of him as Joel.  Each actor fits perfectly into their role. <br /> <br />This is the kind of movie to watch multiple times (hence, the definition--or at least sign--of cinematic quality).  The first viewing engages and surprises you.  In following viewings, you come to appreciate the ingenuity of how the plot is structured. And, if you still keep watching it over and over, it's because it has hit you, like it hit me. The movie speaks to real life and has real characters in it, and it makes me, at least, happier because it accepts the broken nature of life for what it is, yet shows how life (even in its brokenness) is beautiful.

B00000016N|5.0|The Doors were probably more controversial than they were influential, but they were certainly one of the signature rock bands of the 1960s. The group was formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by a pair of U.C.L.A. film students, keyboard player Ray Manzarek and vocalist Jim Morrison, along with guitarist Robby Krieger and drummer John Densmore. Because the group did not have a bass player their music was dominated by Manzarek's distinctive electric organ work and Morrison's evocative vocals of his evocative lyrics. Signed a year later to Elektra Records with the goal of capturing on vinyl what the group did in live performance, their self-titled debut album featured the hit \\"Light My Fire\\" and because of their distinctive sound became one of the best albums of psychedelic music. In fact, \\"The Doors\\" was such a great album that it made everything that came afterwards pale in comparison and gave credence to the idea the group was on a destructive arc fueled by Morrison's personal problems and then went nova with \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and \\"L.A. Women\\" right before his death.<br /><br />The music of the Doors was a peculiar blend of rock, blues, classical, jazz, and powerful lyrics. Nobody around played guitar like Krieger, while Manzarek's classical influences showed up in his organ riffs, Densmore brought some Latin influences, and Morrison's lyrics contained moments of searing emotional poetry. From the opening notes of \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\" it is clear this group is different. For somebody who was consuming mass quantities of drugs and alcohol, Morrison's lyrics were the sort that students should be discussing in literature class: \\"I found an island in your arms/A country in your eyes,\\" a love that becomes transmuted into \\"arms that chain\\" and \\"Eyes that lie.\\" Then the song explodes into sound as the band announces its presence with authority. This is such a key song in the history of the Doors that there is reason it leads off most anthologies and collections of their best songs.<br /><br />\\"Light My Fire,\\" and I can remember finally getting to listen to the long version having only heard the single version with the impressive, intricate organ solo that still stands alone as the epitome of what can be done with that instrument in a rock song. Then Jose Feliciano proved how good it was in his totally stripped down acoustic version. \\"Take It As It Comes\\" is also pretty good, even if not quite in that same class. Still, it is the moodiness of \\"The Crystal Ship\\" and the \\"eleven-minute Oedipal drama\\" of \\"The End\\" that defined the Doors as one of the strangest and most ambitious rock groups around. It is impossible to think of another Sixties rock group that was as disturbing as the Doors, an idea codified in popular culture by Francis Ford Coppola's use of \\"The End\\" at the climax of \\"Apocalypse Now.\\" Not only literature classes but future psychologists and psychiatrists could have a field day analyzing Morrison's lyrics as well.ns of their best songs.  <br /> <br />\\"Light My Fire,\\" and I can remember finally getting to listen to the long version having only heard the single version with the impressive, intricate organ solo that still stands alone as the epitome of what can be done with that instrument in a rock song.

B000067J1H|5.0|Frankly, I had thought it was just an action movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. <br /> <br />Edward Norton is the unnamed protagonist, an insomniac whose job in the daily grind of the office is driving him nuts. The only thing he cares about is his furniture, and the only way he can find solace is through support groups--for problems he doesn't have. But when Marla begins to frequent all the same support groups, he knows she's a faker too, and it disrupts his peace of mind. Fortunately, help is on the way. <br /> <br />He encounters Tyler Durden, a confident, reckless soap salesman who grasps the protagonist's problem while sitting next to him on the plane. Material things are the problem, of course. And when the protagonist's apartment blows up (gas leak, ya know), he finds himself embracing nihilism and abandoning his support groups. <br /> <br />He and Tyler start Fight Club to relieve the stress of life in the consumer world, but it escalates without the protagonist's knowledge into a terrorist organization that spreads across the country. The Fight Club members joined to escape conformity, but it follows them, and they become nameless soldiers in a war against society. The protagonist is morally opposed to the terrorism, yet unable to halt it. Tyler seems untouchable, surrounded by his aura of confidence and an army of fanatics. <br /> <br />Personally, I liked the twist, but it wasn't a surprise for me--someone revealed the twist before I saw the movie. The twist made one or two things make less sense, but didn't change the overall philosophy examined by the movie. The twist just made the movie more interesting psychologically, and the action afterwards was great, very intense. <br /> <br />Overall, an excellent movie. Some very humorous bits, some great camera tricks, and some great action, plus psychological thrills and an interesting philosophy. And I didn't even mention the romance!
1591840562|5.0|I was give this book by the chairperson of my company. This is a good way to get a book up to the top of my reading list.<br /><br />Anyone who is starting a new organization of any kind should get hold of this book. I am buying copies for (i) my son who wants to start a design business, (ii) my daughter who also wants to start a design business, though not with her brother, (iii) co-founders of my company, (iv) a young woman I mentor who is on her fourth start-up. Guy Kawasaki should pay my chariman a commission.<br /><br />Why do I like this book so much? It rings true. It is full of practical and easy to implement advice. It reaches out to other important books and ideas: everything from Thomas Kuhn and Clayton Christensen to Jacob Nielsen (books by all of these authors are pretty much essential reading so I will let you search for them on Amazon) to interesting looking books on networking and branding.<br /><br />First rate work.
B00018TI5E|5.0|Those expecting to rock out are going to be disappointed.  However, liking melody and depth over artists that use the same 3 power chords and sounding angry, this music struck many nerves (in a good way) that a lot of other works havent.  the Lo-Fi sounds mixed in with the slide guitars, string arrangements, and other quirks and oddities make this John's best performance that I have listened to.  It all seems to bind together in a way that most albums do not.  Carvel is a great opener as it lets the listener know what they are in for; A more effects driven album rather than all guitars and drums.  Every Person is tied for my favorite song on this album with its sweeping slide guitar over vocals ever few seconds.. really does something as far as bringing out emotion.. 23 go in to end is an absolute gem as far as listening to a song tell a story without words.  Time Goes Back is my other favorite as it is a classic song with a classic rock feel to it *which is my style* <br />Overall, this album is forever in my car and on my computer available to listen at the touch of a button.  Excellent work.
B00005UEAR|4.0|This is a must for Dream Theater fans, but if you're not acquainted with DT, I'd steer clear of this album until you're more accustomed to their writing styles.  <br /> <br />CD one if full of independent songs (unlike, as another reviewer put it, one flowing song that follows onto disc 2), and there are many classics to be heard here, such as The Glass Prison (which Mike Portnoy wrote the lyrics for, based on his AA experiences).  <br /> <br />CD two starts off with the album's only instrumental, Overture, which is a mix between classical writing styles and rock instrumentation. Track 2, About to Crash, is a light-ish track with a nice piano solo to start (which for LTE fans is reminiscent of Biaxident). Tracks 3 and 4 are a lot heavier, and there's some nice riffage going on there. Track 5, Goodnight Kiss, is one of the lightest songs on the album, and has a great bluesy-type solo towards the end. Solitary shell, track 6, again is a lighter track which features a nice improv-solo from Rudess. Track 7, About to Crash Reprise, has what is probably the most catchy riff on the album, and starts off very optimistic-sounding, but turns very dark by the end, which leads perfectly into the finale of the album, which, by an astounding coincidence, is called Grand Finale. Again, the classical element of Six Degrees comes back into this song with an epic sounding string ensemble opening the track, and this track is also very dark. The only problem I have with the last track is that it fades out very slowly at the end (taking about 1:30 to fade out fully), and this can get annoying when in a playlist with other albums. <br /> <br />To clear up a few points made by a previous reviewer - it does not follow on the story from SFaM, disc 1 and 2 are independent of each other in terms of music and lyrics, disc 2 was NOT recorded in 1 take (and unless your hours have 43 mins in them, it's not an hour long).
0446310786|5.0|I liked the book because it dealt with racism.  Even though it was set in the 1930's, racism still exists in the 21st century.  It may never fade away-there are still many prejudiced people.
B0001KZM3O|4.0|Than alot of stuff out there.  This album is unofficially the 3 album of the Wall.  It goes alot deeper into Roger Waters talking about the loss of his father and wondering why he died when there are still wars.  One of my favorite songs ever is \\"The Gunners Dream\\".  It gets into my head and stays there.  I also like \\"the Fletcher Memorial Home\\". <br /> <br />If you get a chance, seek out the videos, they definately add to the whole thing. <br /> <br />On the Re-master, it's cool they added \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\", but it doesn't seem to fit into the rest of the album musically.
0783219172|4.0|This movie seemed like a mixture of Beetlejuice, Ghost, Ghostbusters, and Psycho. I still can't make up my mind if I shall consider this a parody or if Peter Jackson was being serious. But it was fun to watch anyway!
B0002DRDBE|1.0|This movie hasn't aged well. The actors can't act and the dialog comes off stilted and over-written. Smith isn't as clever as he thinks he is.    To paraphrase Harrison Ford to George Lucas:\\"You can write this (...), but you sure can say it!\\".
0792844939|3.0|There *are* things to love in NYNY. But over and over again I kept coming back to this thought: does director Martin Scorsese (normally a genius storyteller) really love musicals, or is he, in fact, doing a satire of them here? I can't find any other expanation for the creation of a leading character (DeNiro) so self-absorbed, rude, brutish, and jealous of his future wife's (Minnelli) growing fame, while trying so hard to establish his own with a tenor sax. It's like there's a highly pitched voice of reason trying to remind the audience that in real life, people aren't so happy as they always seem to be in musicals. I know everyone doesn't love (many, in fact, proudly hate) musicals, but usually one can find something redeeming in the characters who populate the stories. For over 2 1/2 hours of film, we are presented with a love story which borders on spousal abuse, and somehow be expected to care about the husband. It doesn't work. And yet, Scorsese bends over backward to recreate the 1940's musical/big band atmosphere, from Hawaiian shirts and two-tone spectator shoes to sumptuous big band pieces, not to mention a charming pair of dancers spotted on a subway ledge (Gene Kelly and Vera-Ellen?) or a sultry torch singer in a Harlem nightclub (Diahnne Abbott, whose 11th-hour performance of 'Honeysuckle Rose' seems to be tipping a hat to Billie Holiday). One critic seemed to personally resent the channeling of mother Garland through daughter Minnelli (particularly in the supper club where the title song is stunningly performed with all guns blazing),  but I think that was very much on purpose. Even though she got much bigger acclaim for \\"Cabaret,\\" I think Minnelli reached the peak of her musical talents in this film. I loved her. I just didn't love them together, and unfortunately, that kept me from loving the whole project. Release it on DVD, and skip to your favorite parts.
B0000026T4|5.0|Alice Cooper....the most underrated artist in the history of music, delivered this amazing CD which brought him back into the spotlight after the last few CD's didnt make much of a impact. It is the most catchy CD I have ever head, 8 or 9 of the 10 songs are very very catchy. By the way, does anyone know where I can get the shirt he is wearing on the front of his cd? If so email me at music_kid@hotmail.com ALICE ROCKS
B000002VCW|5.0|The year is 1976-77 I am a junior in college and I am dating a girl going to school in a city 90 minutes from my campus. She was my first love and it was the best year of my life. Al Stewart's album takes me back to a time when the possibilities were endless and I took love for granted until it was too late. His music stands the test of time and will always be a bridge to that mystical year. It is nice to know that others appreciate this great musician. Oh, I almost forgot I got to see Al in concert at the Cincinnati Music Hall in 1979 and he was great!!!!!!!
B000002WYT|1.0|I don't get it! Every song this guy records sounds the same , a hambone mixture of knee slap Hee-Haw guitar rhythyms and Mr Haney singing over it. This stuff is like Forest Gump with a record deal. I am not sure when this discharge was released but was unfortunate enough to suffer through a few numbers. I gotta tell you I was ready to get back to that sock drawer-in silence . The only thing that could make some of these songs worse actually occured - HORNS! Now you have Glen Miller meets Hee Haw meets Mr Haney.     If it were not for Matthews ability to semi-yodel he would be the poster child for the tone deaf- he throws you off with that yodel trick. People revere this guy as a great guitar player which I don't get either- throws you off with that Junior Samples knee slap move - Smoke and Mirrors.    I hope he stops soon!
068987474X|5.0|First I have not read the book, but I have been going through the reviews.  As a guy, I am simplistic in thinking.  It is true, things are mostly black and white in my world.  I have essentially three emotions: happy, neutral, pissed.  One thing a saw in a number of reviews is the man pursues then retreats and women are trying to understand this male concept.  It is rather easy.  One word, sex.  The male wants the sex, but doesn't want it to fall into a relationship, so he doesn't want to get to close.  It is a game, how to get in her pants, but yet not be committed, both at the same time.  That would be why they are called \\"players\\".  However, not all males are players, women should keep that in mind.  For example, the non-players are generally not found at bars/clubs.  You have the exceptions, but generally not.  As an example my wife and I met at a speedway while I worked on race car.  It is one of those, who would have thought type stories.  And I love her very much and I also compliment her everyday as much as possible.
B00006879E|1.0|Quick ! Someone get me a tourniquet, I just slit my wrists after hearing a few cuts off this tragic discharge. Congatulations boys ! You have just fused the sounds of Eminem , Toto , and Ben Folds Five, I did not think that was possible. Moron 5 is finding old ways to offend the intelligent while stealing money from the ignorant , a feat not easily obtained! Come one and come all to see these dorks belt out some hard driving regurgitated Billy Joel type melodies .    This music is trite and belongs on a commercial for panty hose. I am endlessly amazed at the music industry's lack of scope and artistic integrity . This is the Archie's with better recording technology . No soul , No vision . Hey - where's that tourniquet?
B00004T0US|4.0|This was the last album released during Elvis Presley's lifetime.  At this point in Elvis's life, he refused to go to a recording studio, for whatever reason.  So, RCA Records brought a mobile recording studio to Graceland, in the hopes of getting another album out of him.  Things didn't go exactly as they planned, as Elvis recorded only a handful of songs, despite how easy they made it for him.  So, in order to have enough songs to fill out an album, they recorded Elvis live on tour, hoping he would perform some songs he hadn't previously recorded.  Even then, they still didn't have enough songs for an album, so they padded out the album with \\"Let Me Be There\\", which had previously been released on the L[[ASIN:B000002WE9 Live on Stage in Memphis]] album.  So after all that, how is the album?  Pretty good, actually, although it is far from Elvis's strongest album.  \\"Way Down\\" and \\"Moody Blue\\" are strong efforts, and most of the other songs are pretty good, although \\"It's Easy For You\\" is kind of weak and \\"Little Darlin'\\" is treated as a joke.  Not to mention that \\"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\\" is practically the same song as \\"Let Me Be There\\".  As bonus tracks, the CD features the entire [[ASIN:B002ZBEFF8 From Elvis Presley Boulevard]] album, which was also recorded at Graceland.  This album also features some good moments and some not so good moments.  \\"Hurt\\" is a fantastic performance that is arguably the last great recording Elvis ever made.  \\"For the Heart\\" is another good one, and I have to admit that I have a soft spot for Elvis's version of \\"Danny Boy\\".  The rest of the material is uneven, but at least Elvis was recording songs he actually liked, unlike some other occasions.  This CD should appeal to all of the King's fans.
B0002SROSQ|4.0|Anyone who has followed Mr Cave over the past couple of decades will be surprised to hear some new sounds here. On the first cd (Abattoir Blues) there are some great new drum sounds and great scuffles on guitar from Mick Harvey , who seems to be able to fill his own boots as well as Blixa's on this outing. This equates to some great rhythyms for Nick to weave his usual lyrical web. It amazes me that Cave is not more well known than he is , although he has come a long way over the years. The only thing I will have to get used to on Abattoir is the choir that seems to pop up too often for my taste. It seems that touch appeals to most of the other reviewers here - so what do I know? Hats off to Nick for adding another flavor , I will aquire a taste for it I am sure. <br /> <br />Now on to disk two (Lyre of Orpheus). To me this disk is the one I will spin most often as it encapsules everything that is missing from most music - creative wit, intelligence , and real emotion. Cave can pull you into a feeling or story like no other, I can't think of anyone else who compares except the other Nick (Drake)or Michael Gira / Angels of Light (check him out)! I won't go into all of the songs for a blow by blow , but anyone interested in hearing a truly gifted artist needs to get this pair of cd's as well as other Cave offerings. His discography covers the widest range of musical ,lyrical content, and emotions than I personally have ever heard in a rock or blues based setting . <br /> <br />Go get it and Let the Bells Ring!!
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is basically propaganda. What Moore has done is taken bits and pieces of creditable news and chopped it down into very small pieces and tainted it. For example, during one point of the movie Bush is talking about how he doesn't think about \\"him,\\" very often. Moore implies that this is Osama BinLaden but, Bush never states that this is who he is talking about or implies it. Moore has created a movie that is very similiar to the type of propaganda the Soviet's used in their own country, or even the propaganda in Nazi Germany. This movie is filled with clips to stir emotions. He uses these emotions to try to lead one to a conclusion that has no fact. This movie is just meant to misinform Americans who do not keep themselves informed on a regular basis. Moore has created one of the greatest pieces of propaganda in Soviet history. Don't watch this movie, unless you want to waste two hours of your time on junk.
