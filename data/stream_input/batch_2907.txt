B00CATONCA|4.0|Got to have it if you consider yourself a walking dead fan. The detail and quality of this product is far better than I expected. Makes a great collectors piece.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive. Love playing. If you like search games you will love this game. The addition of puzzles ups the challenge.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Wow, has this band matured in a short period of time! More than some other bands achieve in a whole career. Not that there's anything wrong with putting out the same pleasant stuff; it's only pop music. But still, the lyrics have advanced beyond reporting what's happening on the quad, and the music has grown leaps and bounds in complexity. Plus, the album coheres and bears repeated listening to make out the lyrics. I'm not sure anyone expected these preppy boys to be more than a pleasant, ephemeral diversion, but it looks like a long career lies ahead.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wish the game was longer. Really gets you using your brain. I suggest keeping a pen and paper handy to jot down little notes and clues.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Make the time to read this skinny yet powerful book, and you'll find yourself seriously pondering your 'purpose' in life. The first half about Viktor's time in death camps, just sets the stage - by stripping away everything from mankind - Viktor was able to focus on people's souls. The second half presents his insights in a manner that is simple, yet so profound. A true classic and a must read.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Heart breaking, heart warming, the human spirit the heart of a American SEAL.<br />Deep in the heart of Texas.  Inspirational.
B000B8L6LI|3.0|it's ok, but doesn't work well with all knives. It is adequate but could be improved upon; the rods need to be fastened so they don't move as much.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent read! Riveting and full of suspense, Harry B is at his best. Very well written and paced. Great book
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I think, this is a very interesting book: it was great to read about the motivations of Steve Jobs. I understand, this book is about him, but I think, there's too little information about the newest Apple products. Only breadcrumbs about the iPhones, iPads and quite nothing about the very revolutionary new Macs, especially MacBook Air.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played it really really awesome I think it should be free though

B002NXOQF2|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read, and now I've finished I feel like the story is still going inside me and any moment my mom will come and read more about Hazel and his friends. This is a definite five stars and I totally recommend it!!
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|This novel was a good read with its strange fantastical elements, however it does not live up to Gaiman's other novels or graphic novel series, seemed a bit slow in parts.  However despite that it is still an excellent story just not up to my expected standards (5 stars) for Neil Gaiman.
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|The maps are unreadable.  Can't even do a zoom.  Tables and charts same way.  This was my first Kindle book and I guess it was a bad place to start.
B00DJ6KYWQ|4.0|Frederick Forsyth has again added another quality spy novel to his burgeoning list of quality spy/thriller novels.  While this is not as good as Day of the Jackal or Fist of God it is still a quality novel.  The pace and detail of the novel are excellent like usual for Forsyth and I would recommend this novel to any Forsyth fans or fans of the spy/thriller genre.
0345803485|1.0|A few female co-workers spoke highly of this book, so I bulged in after stumbling upon a used copy for $.50 cents in a local thrift shop. \\"Deeply disappointed\\" quite doesn't describe the experience of reading this pile of manure. The writer is British and decided to place the events in USA, of which the writer (E.L.James or Erika Mitchell) obviously has very little knowledge of. The language and style is extremely repetitive and amateurish in most aspects. \\"Ana , \\"Kate\\" and \\"Christian\\" are the main Characters. Cannot say much to spoil the cliche-filled story other than Ana has some self-esteem issues and is attracted to Christian, who is a sadomasochist. There is some explicit, erotic, low-grade storytelling involved, which is usually fine except here it was done with little taste. The only way this crap managed to get so much attention was trough an aggressive publicity campaign based on hype.  I still cannot believe the author has outsold Rowling in the UK. To the habitual reader, I cannot recommend enough to avoid wasting their time with this publication.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a fun interpretation of golf that makes it easy to play on a smart phone. It is no replacement for the game itself. However, it is a great game.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I ordered 2 of these and waited a month for them.during that time I considered canceling my order a few times because of the chromecasts limitations. I finally decided that its only $70 so why not keep them, we'll they o work but as of now all I can use them for is YouTube and Netflix. I don't subscribe to Netflix and I rarely use YouTube so they are kind useless to me. I was definitely hoping for the ability to stream from either my computers hard drive or my iPad. So for the 1 time a year I want to view a YouTube video on two of my tvs them in good to go. Otherwise not worth it. Google should have made some more partnerships before releasing this product. Btw I have a smart tv so I can get you tube on it already. Guess I'm the dumb one.
B002JCSWV6|3.0|its not the best movie but not the worst i dont think ill wathch again but it will stay in my collection

B00ESY7QXI|5.0|i really liked the movie. I will definitely be reading the book. I can see the similarities to Moulin Rouge as they both have the same director

B004KPLVV8|4.0|This movie is great to watch. When you consider the technology that was available in 1982, they did a fantastic job. It's interesting to see it with what we had then and what we have now!
B007SPPANM|3.0|bought it for my niese she wanted to lern some faly history so i bought her this one i like it good one to get
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I have read a few reviews that complained how this book delivers a story from different perspectives. That is what I loved about this book. I was hooked after the first few chapters.  Had to read it in one sitting.
B000JLTRKE|5.0|bought it how many years ago and it was borowed out and never returnd so i bought it again a plus
B0064X7FVE|1.0|update pretty much killed any usability. less features. horrible interface. no info. but I just found a replacement that's even better than the original weather channel app. goodbye weather channel...
B00004W221|3.0|not the best movie but i had a lot of problems with the movie fast forwarded it threw some of the movie so i probly missed some crusal parts
B00CTT9646|1.0|Before I begin bashing this product, I would like to state that \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" is the best summer blockbuster of 2013.  With that said, I want to state that I'm reviewing this product, not the movie.<br /><br />There are not enough words in the english dictionary to express how disappointed and angry I feel about this product.  The problem with this product is that the special features have been distributed between different retailers.  So what you get from this product is a 1:1 Starfleet Phaser, and 7 special features(on the blurry) which ads up to about 45 minutes of content.  Not exactly Christmas.  There are no deleted scenes, and most notably, NO DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY.<br /><br />What's even more infuriating, is that there are 12 more special features out there, and Director's commentary. To unlock this content you'll have to buy 2 more copies of the movie (one from Best Buy, and one from Target).  On top of that, to get the Director's commentary, you'll have to download the movie from iTunes.<br />Fortunately, with the download code, you can download the movie from iTunes.<br /><br />When spending $70 on a movie, I expect to have every single special feature included on my BluRay.  The fact that I only got 7 (special features) and no Director's commentary is a rip off.  I never expected Paramount to rip their fans off like this, especially to people who spent the extra cash.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|its ok but it teaches you cops are no better than us they just have a badge to hide behind
6304698798|2.0|The good: stunning blu ray transfer, perfect casting and production design.<br />The bad: the nature of greed, violence, and especially war are not fully explored.<br />The ugly: too many similar smug macho confrontations, close ups, and schemes.<br />I finally realize Eastwood is never \\"acting\\" as much as \\"posturing\\" while grunting out lines and Tarantino is a shameless vulture.
B006QPX6IG|5.0|it was a good movie from what i bremember they broke every barer but sam lee its great would recomend i dont think youll regret it
1451648537|5.0|Whether you love Apple products or not, this is a great biography on one of the most important person in the last century. There is no undercutting the contributions Jobs left our world, and for the future generations, he will go down in the history books (if there are still &#34;history books&#34;) as one of the great minds in human history.<br /><br />Personally, I liked my Apple products. However, after reading this book, I gained a much deeper appreciation for just how much effort is put into every detail of every product. The word &#34;seamless&#34;, as Jobs often used, really didn't hit me until I read about what went behind the scene. Apple products are truly pieces of art.<br /><br />Whether you agree with the above paragraph or not, this book will be a good read nonetheless. Steve Jobs is a dynamic leader. Isaacson doesn't just paint a one dimensional portrait of his character, but reports the bad with the good. His life is an amazing successful story, but there are also plenty of failures on the personal and professional fronts. His story is an amazing tale, yet it brings the readers closer to the harsh realities of this world. It is a story of a man who tries to define his place in this world, all the while leaving an amazing legacy.<br /><br />I am not an avid reader of biographies, but I kept the page turning, eagerly anticipating the next page even though I know what happens. Just as Jobs meticulously select the right degree of curvitures on the iPod, he has also picked the most suitable writer to tell his story. And like the iPod, Steve Job's life and this book are both works of art.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|watched it before did the tame thing when it comes 2 collecting cards stats  he would of went down as the highest paid coach in history

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I have watched this 3 times and it never disappoints me.  I will continue to watch it again and again.  I love the combination of all the super heroes.  Can't wait for a sequel and another after that.  Robert Downey Jr brings out a funny and realistic approach to Iron Man (I have watched the Iron Man movies multiple times, too).  I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
0792839730|4.0|if i didnt get other movies on this war i would not be intrested in this one but it mainly focused on that dam bridge them trying to come over or us tryin to get over there

B004JRVQX0|1.0|I bought Autotune 7 and was ready to use it but I couldn't use it because I didn't have one of these! and it cost like $50 or something like that...what a STUPID RIPOFF.<br /><br />So you buy software but you can't use it unless you buy one of these?!? how stupid is that?<br />So if you buy a car do you have to buy the keys separately?!?<br /><br />I had to buy it and had to wait a few days for it to arrive (lame) and after going through the hassle of setting up on online account. It worked - big WHOOPY!!! The software should work without one of these stupid keys using up one of my USB ports.<br /><br />I get disgusted looking at this ripoff plugged into my laptop just so I can use software that I already paid for.<br /><br />k, i'm done - i'm actually a positive person :)
B00CRS5HII|5.0|He truly is an amazing artist. Love his &#34;country side&#34;, If you liked Hootie & the Blowfish, then you will love this! :) His vocal range is amazing and the duets add a nice variety.

B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Great book for those who are into forbidden romance while still enjoying a bit of adventure. If u like twilight ,the host or warm bodies u are going to love this book.
B007X4ECLY|5.0|i LOVED this movie! i feel like they didnt't advertise it that well which is a shame because it was a really great.movie. I know people complained saying \\" oh, this movie was predictable action movie blah blah blah...\\" i don't agree with that.  thought plot was great, with the jail.in outerspace, very cool. the effects were great especially the city scenes in the begining i wish they showed more of that. and the acting was great as well. Snow played but Guy pearce(prometheus, iron man 3) has become one of my favorite characters. Guy did an amazing job. he was hilarious and was a huge smart ass. He kind of reminded me of Michael Weston from the tv show Burn Notice. So if your a fan of action/syfy type movies with a smart ass guy as the hero than watch this movie!
B0039NCJFO|1.0|did not work on any of my devices so  was not able to view it and was disappointed about this
0440246318|3.0|I held off buying this book for quite a while because of the poor reviews at Amazon.  It was the worst Reacher book yet, in my opinion, but it still wasn't that bad.  Same formula as the others, which is getting a bit old, and long descritions, which serve little or no purpose.  The ending was very abrupt with unanswered questions. The fact is, a bad Reacher book is still better than most books.
0470876417|5.0|This crowd-sourced book is an absolute jewel both for novices and for business model experts. Its visual and design-thinking approach makes it a very accessible and pleasurable reading experience. Its goal is to provide a mental framework to facilitate your journey into business modelling and at the same time to help you focus on the main building stones of a business model. It finally shows you how to juggle with those building stones to generate new business ideas. A must-have.
B00ET7EON4|4.0|Arctic Monkeys deliver what is their most instantly enjoyable record in a long time. The band has been through several different phases of varying success. Starting with their humble punk/garage rock beginnings of their first two albums, through the dark and heavy production of Humbug, to the more light-hearted Suck It and See, they have performed pretty much all the splinter groups of the rock genre. On AM, the band takes on a simpler sound, mostly consisting of basic hip-hop beats and guitar riffs. Although more simplistic than their previous releases, that in no way takes away from the overall experience. In fact, songs like the Black Keys-esque Do I Wanna Know? and Why'd You Always Call Me When You're High?, both incredibly simple in structure, prove to be the 'classic singles' of the album. The real winners, however, are the 1-2-3 punch of No. 1 Party Anthem, Mad Sounds, and Fireside, three tunes prominently featuring piano/keyboards that completely change up the whole tone of the album. The first drips of melancholy like an Elton John ballad, the second sounds like a beautiful and optimistic Lou Reed/T. Rex song, and the third is an almost paranoid throwback to the late 60's/early 70's. That being said, AM is truly an album that wears it's influences on it's sleeve, sometimes to a fault. Despite the occasional cheesy lyrics and it's few missteps (One For the Road and I Want It All) Arctic Monkeys' new album is certain to go down as a favorite for some and a welcome return to form from the shaky Suck It and See. 8/10
B00B22ASUM|5.0|The story is very interesting and it will drag you into the book. The book is well written and easy to read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book totally had my interest from the first word and I had a hard time putting it down. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the way the book ended.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun to play and have just the right amount of difficulty to keep you interested but not frustrated. Would recommend to my friends.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I found this book some where and decided to download it on my kindle. I LOVED IT!!! It was truly one of the best books I have ever read. It is good for people who are not to young because of some words here and there but over all, a great book by the author Rebbecca Stead, I will definitely check into some of her other books.<br /><br />  Your Friend,<br />  The Peace Dude
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I want to say thank you to JJ Abrams and the rest of those involved in bringing us this fantastic film.<br />I was invested in this film from the moment the enterprise rose out of the ocean.  The character development was spot on and I believed everything Spock felt and experienced.  These actors portraying the iconic characters of Trek are brilliant.  And I wish I could see them weekly on a new Trek show rather then every few years.<br />The soundtrack to this film rocks, and on my home theater, it was amazing.  Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Harrison, and brings a level of belief that Montalban never could.  Mr. Cumberpatch with few words is as dangerous as anything, and also with just a few words can show his love for his crew.  He is one of my new favorite actors.<br /><br />Today, everyone is a director, a producer, a writer, and an actor.  Everyone knows how to make a move, but not how to enjoy a movie.  We have lost something with the dawn of the internet.  As a child I loved the movies, as it allowed you to escape into worlds only dreamed of.  And for 1-2 hours, we were entertained.  They were popcorn flicks.  Today, we tear films down, micro manage them and reject them before ever viewing one scene.<br /><br />This film is from start to finish an amazing ride.  And the twist at the end had me in such emotional turmoil.  The actors really did so well.  I was thoroughly entertained.  I love this film.  Watch it.
B000EBEHR2|3.0|I ended up buying the CD for the title track and infrared.  Toegther on I-tunes they would have cost more than buying teh CD used.  If you really want the two most played tracks just buy the CD and save yourself money.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|My greatest complaint is Martin's predictable need to destroy the beloved characters he has created; to vanquish his heroes and to revel in the triumph of &#34;evil&#34; or lesser characters. Is the disappointment of the reader something he takes pleasure in? Why create such a wealth of amazing characters, kill them all and then send us on a wild goose chase with Brianne of Tarth (talk about your all time bores)? If there is anything I have come to rely on it's that for a certainty Martin will destroy any hopes I entertain just as they are about to be realized. So I now expect the ruin of all that I am emotionally invested in and am therefore never disappointed.  Can you throw us a bone here at some point? As a result, I often put the books down for extended periods of time. I pray that he can tie it all together in the end. There is little that remains which I actually care about and I am afraid to care too much...<br />That being said I love the books.
1616550414|5.0|The book is gorgeous! The content is no less than amazing! It's everything I could've wanted to know about Legend of Zelda and more. The price for it was great too! If you love Legend of Zelda, you HAVE to get this!

141935972X|5.0|The Outlander series just can't be beat and this book lives up to my expectation. Listened in car mainly which made it convenient.
0385349947|1.0|The book talks too much about personal stories, and doesn't really help to achieve goals in life. She looks at women as creatures that need special treatment
B006QKKMBA|4.0|I like the suspense in the movie. All of the Final Destination movies have a lot of action and suspense.
B00C2IPB9S|5.0|Great quality movie and an amazing Steelbook! To go along with this it is one of the greatest movies of all time!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|While Outview has been classified as YA book, I believe that book is equally suited for adult readers.<br /><br />The book was very well-written, with a strongly developed and complex protagonist and a tight plot that both young adults and adults will find appealing.  The book was very hard to put down, once I started reading it.  There are many twists and turns that keep you turning pages, and you will have to know what happens to the main character once you get into the meat of the book.<br /><br />There are many reviews for this book that give you details about the subject matter of this book, but I just wanted to say that I have read and reviewed many books recently, and this is the best one that I have read in a long time.  Buy it.
0143036742|2.0|This book might be OK to read with a group to dissect chapter by chapter, however, the characters were not developed enough for the reader to particularly care about them or find them interesting.  Toshiba apples or no, not really worth reading.
1423136802|5.0|It's in great condition and I love the books! They're GREAT! PERCYBETH FOREVER!!! Next in line, THE HEROES OF OLYMPUS!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This game really harkens back to space invaders/galaga/galaxian days.  I love not needing to press a fire button.  Blast away at 80 different levels (can't get past 71 personally) in a fast-paced shooter with the aliens coming at you in, for the most part, predictable patterns.  Very clean graphics, but the screen gets busy when the power ups really create some massive artillery displays.<br /><br />Easy to understand, pause button makes it easy to stop and start when you're just sitting around for five minutes waiting in line, etc.<br /><br />Yes, you must be online, which I don't understand, but don't begrudge as it doesn't appear to send much data in/out.<br /><br />Heartily recommend for a pass-time game.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|It's so much more than just about running. Gives a bit of insight into some pretty puzzling minds for us average people, and I think that is the beauty of this book. As with all books, take it all with a grain of salt. I'm glad I finally got the courage to get over my preconceived notion of a journalist trying to squeeze fame out of the Rarámuri's way of life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead season 3 is addictive. I dream in zombies now. The actors are so believable that you feel like you are with them. I give props to everyone involved in making this AMC materpiece.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Want to know the characters in depth and how they are connected - read the book.  Has given me many \\"aha\\" moments when I may have been a bit confused watching the series.
B00DQVST76|5.0|Awesome coverage of the Hottest tour of 2012. If you didn't get the opportunity to see this show live, this dvd does an excellent job of bringing you up close and personal with Lady Madonna.  Having seen the show live, this dvd does the show justice and then some. I almost wished I had just waited for the dvd!!! Except there is nothing like seeing Madonna in person! Picture quality is awesome and so is the sound. Turn the sound up and be prepared to experience MDNA LIVE. I understand now why she delayed the release several times. Great Concert experience on DVD!
B006WAIV6M|5.0|The book is an eye-opener.  Well researched, and easy to read.  It shows that we can improve our lives by changing our bad habits.  Habits can be changed simply by changing the routine part, while keeping the cue and the reward.  The book organization is also appealing, as it treats habits of the Individual, the Company and Society separately. It can be compared to such works by Rhonda Byrne and Dale Carnegie, who show us simply ways to significantly improve our living conditions.
0307887448|5.0|I'm 28, so I was born in the 80s, but I missed most of the references to the pop culture and movies in Ready Player One. I'll admit to Google searching who the hot chick in Ladyhawke was, but at the same time, I'm a gamer nerd, so I appreciate the references to things like online forums and online interactions with your gaming friends.<br /><br />That said, this book absolutely blew me away! There was never a lull where it was easy for me to put the book down. The absolute epitome of a page-turner. The characters were very human and believable. The story was fast-paced, but didn't leave you wanting more details like some fast-paces stories can do.<br /><br />Plus, my wife and I are the people that will watch a movie/read a book and know when the big twist is coming and we lose the surprise factor. Neither of us caught on to a couple of the twists in this story.<br /><br />I've read 2 books since I've finished Ready Player One and I keep comparing the experience of that book with this one. I wish I could extend this book by another 300 pages and keep the experience going.<br /><br />So go ahead, immerse yourself into the Oasis. My wife and I did and we loved it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|it is super fun and can be very challenging. I stuck right now on a star and money but it is still enjoyable when get past one you've been on for a while.
B00EFNXPFK|1.0|I have been a John Mayer fan for some time and have previously enjoyed his music. I have read these other reviews, wow he must have you guys snowed. So here it is folks, if you the new lala pop music program, this will be a gold mine for you. That's all it is and it is full of it. If however you are looking for the burning electricity of the hot rock and blues guitar, forget it, He forgot where he put it. It is not used on this album. So if that is what you are looking for you will have to go somewhere else to find it!!!<br />There is one song on the album that had real meaning to me, \\"You're No One Till Someone Let's You Down\\", It means a lot to know I am someone now because John Mayer has let me down!

B009U9S6FI|5.0|The author was a Jewish prisoner in Nazi death camps for several years. He survived because of good luck and his skills as a psychiatrist. His message is simple: what keeps you going through the most horrible circumstances is having a burning desire to accomplish a meaningful goal or task when the ordeal is over. Every thoughtful reader will benefit from reading this book.

B0040I09RM|5.0|Started viewing this series late.  Just finished season one and plan to continue on until I get up to date.
B0034G4P9E|3.0|This review pertains to the picture quality only.  The movie is 5 stars.  I bought this on DVD the day it came out before I had blu ray.  Their are early scenes in the movie where the picture quality shows a lot of fuzz.  I thought that by upgrading to the blue ray it would clear it up, but the same fuzz appears(mainly in the opening scene inside the father's house.  If you have the DVD, I don't recommend spending the money to upgrade to blu ray as I didn't see a difference.
1781162646|4.0|Part ghost, part crime story of a young man who worked in an amusement park as a sort of release to get over his first love, only finding out lots of other things as he went along. He gained new friends, a fresh perspective, a crime story-turned ghost haunting and the real picture behind the crimes that led him into a semi-dangerous path.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|loved it as much as the movie.  Michael was an incredible talent and it shows up in every beat of this CD.
B004ULEEY8|3.0|I thought this would have more fullness to it,ike &#34;Independence Day&#34;. Kind of bland, but did have alot of action.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|What can you say, other then if you enjoy the series of &#34;Batman&#34; then you really enjoy this one also.<br />I feel very good acting and never a lose for action
1439152810|5.0|Kate Morton is my new favorite young author!  She uses her mastery of language to weave an intriguing plot line filled with rich, human characters!  I consider her book the Secret Keeper one of my all time favorite books!  All of her 4 books are worth the read.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Clint Eastwood did a excellent job in this movie.  If you enjoy stories about the great game of baseball,<br />you will really enjoy this.  Not all movies have to be academy award wining, just exciting to watch and remember.
B00B4804KS|4.0|I love this movie.  It's an amazing story.  I read the book and have owned various releases of it over the years.  So JP comes out in 3D and I get excited.  (I have a 60 plasma that supports 3D.  I thought this would be the movie that makes me go out and buy the 3D glasses.)  To be honest I normally regard 3D as frippery and an annoyance.  However, Universal spent $10 million alone on making this remaster an excellent experience.  I'm sure it is.  I almost bought it.<br /><br />I did some research to see what the quality differences are (if any) between this new 3D Blu-Ray version compared to the 2D Blu-Ray version.<br /><br />SHORT AND SWEET:  There are problems with the color rendition (sometimes called \\"Color Timing\\") on the 3D version.<br /><br />Go to Youtube and search for \\"Jurassic Park Blu-Ray, Side by Side comparison\\"<br /><br />I'm sure the 3D is awesome but I won't trade it for accurate color balance.<br /><br />This practice of remastering movies with what's called the \\"Blockbuster look\\" (teal / orange cast) is a practice of late with the Hollywood studios. It's supposed to only be used in certain scenes but the studios go ape and put it on EVERY scene.<br /><br />It reminds me of Jeff Goldblum's line in the movie(paraphrased):  \\"You should have asked yourselves just because this * could * be done whether it * should * be done.<br /><br />I can say my 2D Blu-Ray from the import JP Triology set looks stunning.  The only Blu-ray disks I have that rival it for visual quality are Lawrence of Arabia, Baraka, and the iMAX scenes in the Christopher Nolan Batman blu-rays.  The audio - geez - it's a perfect surround mix.  And I only have 5.1.  I can only imagine what 7.1 surround is like with this.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.  3D is not a big deal to me.  Picture and sound quality is.  If you are into 3D buy it - just realize there's a color rendition quality trade-off in doing so.<br /><br />Over and out.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Switched to Weather Bug.  To many ads now.  Liked old format better.<br />Why all the ads now? Will delete all together  soon.

B0013KTGAG|3.0|Other reviews got it right, unsuccessful mix of b movie with syfy pysch thriller. Tried hard but misses the mark.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|Ran across this movie here on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try and am so glad I did for it is one Great movie, lots of belieable action, great special effects, an actor who looks like he could be Conan and the lovely Rachel Nichols doing some fantastic action scenes. This is a keeper and one I'm going to watch again.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Great graphics, very addictive., the rooms are fun. Would like to find some different items. Snatchems are annoying .<br />Diamonds are too hard to earn.
B008JFUO36|2.0|Total waste of time, not only impossible to understand but boring as hell, not a movie to watch again, it will be disposed of ASAP
1401324649|4.0|Took me a few chapters to get used to the style of writing, but well worth persevering - utterly charming - Forrest Gump turns 100!!
B00BNZN27E|3.0|a favorite director of mine, great recordings even in the case of mono rec. sony use the 20 bits masters from the 1990s, but sony already have 2 bargain boxes masters series 24 bits sound ( mahler and mozart)  that sound better than this box. oh no,  sony  give us the box of heifetz , rubinstein  perahia,etc, some of the best mahler, mozart, beethoven, brahms to name some are in this box ,im still waiting for an overall 24 bits remaster of these historic recordings, by now I have to retain the mozart and mahler master series along this box
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great hidden objects game with an interesting plot, great graphics and fun puzzles. It kept my interest through-out the whole game. I would have liked more hidden objects scenes, though.
0446573027|2.0|I am really looking for a good mystery story where we don't have this script of a special forces/ex-military who hooks up with the girl partner who is law enforcement and scripted to act like a man.It seems every crime story has to have the female hard noise Detective who is scripted to act and talks like a man. As soon as you see the big gun  on the female you know it is Cliché. I really roll my eyes when the female has her blouse open to the navel and a gun bigger than she is strapped to her side. Have we as a society come to the point where we accept social engineering in our literature for the development of social change?<br /><br />Was there some feminist guideline written that states all mystery  books have to have the female partner who is an equal to the hero? This nonsense annoys me. What happened to the buddy books? Why is it so politically incorrect to have two guys doing the story? At least I will question this perception we cannot say anything against the lie that women are like men, especially when it comes to how stories like this try to distort the facts.<br /><br />I began to think about this and wonder why it seems all mystery stories have women sidekick detectives? It is becoming such a cliché..
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian Michaels somehow radiates through the tv as you work out to push you to the limit. The first time you will feel like passing out and drinking an entire gallon of water to re-hydrate, but by day four you will feel like you just might not die, and that you are slowly feeling like it is getting easier on level 1. Then you will start level two and realize that you can still push yourself! Great dvd for beginners with no downstairs neighbors. The jump roping sections may not be the best for people who have sensitive downstairs neighbors.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|You can't truly review a book like this without having spoilers.... all one can say is it truly is probably the best fiction series ever written - yes, better than Lord of the Rings.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|I love all of the different options for using this alarm, and it would be super if my Kindle Fire didn't go to sleep to save power...when the alarm goes off, I'm in a fog as to where the Kindle is, how to wake it up, unlock it, and then either hit the snooze or do a math problem.  That trick of doing a math problem really does work to wake up the part of your brain that will help you actually get on your way for the day, but the other steps are just a little too cumbersome.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Must watch tv show in the world, I loved it so much. If you don't watch it you are missing out
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Everything came in great shape sealed with no damage. I will use them again for sure also they had it in the mail ASAP.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game so much it's fun addictive and a great way to stay busy and pass the time.
0452289963|5.0|This is a reference book for awakening. I originally checked it out of the library and decided I need to have it to refer to again and again. So many &#34;aha's&#34; and &#34;duh's&#34;. This man's plain spoken approach to learning about what our ego is up to and how to go about shedding it is so simple and profound. A real joy. A must have.
B003YV64OI|4.0|Runs games well, first one I got had the pins bent so I couldn't install. Second one works great, good buy for a budget amd build.
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|The lightbulbs are SO nice. And they look nice. They are extremely low energy but provide nice, not harsh, lighting. I bought two but sometimes I only use one since they do a better job than I expected. Most of my friends have seen the swirly CFLs but most of them haven't seen these LED so I get a lot of compliments. And I don't mind the dip in my energy bill. I'm converting from CFLs to these babies. So to summarize, this particular brand and product is a good price, saves you money, looks nice, and provides excellent lighting.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Sooooooo good and i am only 12<br />Reading this it was very descriptive and bwtter than the movie i recommend this book
B00EO2I6QU|5.0|As one who knows close to nothing about film and filming I can truly say this is a very interesting story line and I was very interested on the acting. I am over 70 and have been watching horror for most of those years. I do not own this version, but will soon. I have one of the older Kino versions. It is very spellbinding. However do not say his name out loud.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is one of the best apps I have downloaded so far on my kindle fire I give it a two thumbs up.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I like what it does, but you can't STAND IT AT AN ANGLE LONGWAYS. it does serve a good purpose,
B007V2UGPE|4.0|At first glance I was not overly impressed,but after the first couple of levels I was amazed.The graphics are sharp,the helpers are really good,the bonus level are fun ,you have to think quick.Overall 4 out of 5 stars for me.
B00C5WR6JE|5.0|In response to those who are dumping on this record. Bill Frisell has been a luminary of contemporary music for the last thirty years, and his recorded output spans heavy metal to folk-ish trio to modernist-tinged string quartet music. Anyone who thinks HE is the one \\"missing something\\" should sit back a minute and ask themselves how open they are to even hearing the music above the racket of their preconceptions?<br /><br />For fans of Frisell's music, this kind of \\"Humble Listening\\" should not be anything unusual to ask. Naked City? / Before We Were Born? / 858?<br />Remember that after the Naked City years, \\"Nashville\\" seemed pretty avant-garde back in 1997?<br /><br />Sometimes the guy makes records that are listenable in a Bill Evans kind of way, sometimes he makes records craggy in a Eric Dolphy kind of way, but it is all superbly played. Why not let go and learn to listen more deeply, allow your ears to be bent a bit, and enjoy the process instead of moaning that you did not get what you expected, which would raise the question. \\"If we all knew what it would sound like before it came out, why bother releasing it?\\"<br /><br />Part of why someone like Frisell continues to contribute is that he has not been one for the buy-a-mood schtick of some pop, or the Let's-play-Mario-Bros-yet-again (36251-36251-36251) rote-ness of much \\"contemporary\\" jazz music. Maybe, just, maybe, he hears something you do not? Did that occur to you? Even if you don't love it, understand that it is your own laziness, \\"taste,\\" or limitation that is to blame, not his. (This is not breakfast cereal so that the point is not that you \\"like\\" it.)<br /><br />It is totally fine not to like the music. But don't confuse your liking it for it's quality or intrinsic worth. :-)
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is just that you should try it<br /> And there is stuff like pigs blocks and zombies now that you now have fun
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I could not finish reading this book and I really tried.  I kept reading, with the hope that the characters and the plot would improve but realized it wasn't going to happen.  This particular story has been written before but not at this appalling level....really bad.  The writing was just very choppy and the introspection of the characters was just too much and made it a chore to read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like this book as it's the best of both worlds, romantic and suspense filled. I have and will again recommend this book to all of my friends.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this was an amazing book I could not get my hands off.<br />this touching story has deeply inspired me. I recomend this book to any 8-12 year old out there because this great story is a mast read for all even if you arenot into theese type of books

B00070DK14|5.0|Great old album.I love the horns. And all the songs have plots to them. They actually mean something. Love it.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|Moulin Rouge starring Jose Ferrer, and directed by John Huston is one of the great movies that has often be overlooked. I received this gem in perfect condition and the quality was more than expected. It was well packed for mailing, which allowed it to arrive in top condition. Thank you for the great film and great service.

B005J0VPNC|4.0|Really enjoy taking photos with the limited number of filters in this app. Its great since you can use the app with photos that you have already taken through your regular camera. You don't have to take photos only through this app to get the desired &#34;effect&#34; of the filters applied to the photo.
0007107927|5.0|Best book ever. I highly<br />Recommend this item for any aspiring manager or supervisor. The amount of practical &#34;know how and do how&#34; is enchanting.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Its a good input system. But I find Google's stock keyboard better for some reason. The only advantage of this app is that you have the options for &#34;themes&#34; for your keyboard. A fancy way of saying &#34;Color Schemes&#34;. =)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent adventure tale! Light and suspenseful, with twists throughtout. Never a dull moment. Hang on the edge of your seat thrills.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|What else could be more fun and time consuming than cutting up virtual fruit on your phone or tablet? Buy at your own risk! Risk of wasting time!

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|a thorough summary of research on early church and James, the brother of Jesus--Very enlightening re early development of Christianity.
B0058VW36U|4.0|It's an addictive game enabling you to flex that brain muscle in terms of some of the puzzles they have. Everytime I say, &#34;Just one more level and back to work&#34;, I find myself playing another 3 before forcing myself to put it down!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Hi, Why so High Great Action, Great Story's, Music by &#34;BORG&#34; Ausom ! with the fighting. This film is for anyone who loves action, and this film has it with every story line changing it just blow's your mind.

B0035V35PI|4.0|I like this Film a lot Great action and The stunts. I admire the Japans culture and there battles, One is The Samuri  second the Ninjas one brut force .the other Stealth like.so much dedication and long hrs of practice. that is why I love Martial Arts films .Lone  Wolf
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really think this is a great game but one aspect I really looked forward to was the arena. This feature apparently is not available to KIndle and droid players. Will an alternate arena option ever be available for non Apple systems???? This is the only serious flaw I've found in this game. K. Butts
B001JNND9W|3.0|zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzi did love that Blond Hippie Girl on the Motorcycle, I can hear the Beach Boys. and that's that. This film should have vanish
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle is back and she is definately making a statement that Androids rule. The Electric Lady is truly Electrifing and takes you on a sonic journey like none other. I truly believe the music world will be taken aback by this dynamic performance. Colaborations with legends like prince also Miguel and Solange....Wow...Worth Every penny. This is by far a must have cd. This cd will be in serious rotation for months to come.
B004UFEJW6|5.0|This film reminds me of are men in the Arm Service's , and the meaning of the &#34;Core&#34; I hope that we never have to see are men replace by Robots, It's bad enough that some jet pilots are being replace by drones .It  takes Heart and a human mind to handle a Mission .I like Kurt Russell that Guy is awesome i am  close to his age and I can tell you this he is a mans man and he is better in Action Films. Kurt do a &#34;Predator&#34; film now, lol  Lone Wolf 1956

0739375954|5.0|This is a strong story and gives much to think about.  This is the story of a young boy's affair with an older woman, old enough to be his mother.  He meets his friend when be becomes sick.  She helps him walk home, his mother calls the doctor, he is diagnosed with hepatitis.  His mother tells him to thank the lady for her kindness and bring her flowers, thus begins the book.<br /><br />The boy, now a man, is looking back on his life.  He is an innocent young boy who is interested in girls his age, but he feels this woman is too old.  He has no interest in her.  But she is interested in him.  And he becomes attracted to her and keeps going to her apartment.  This woman may have stolen his innocence, his youth, but she did force him to reconsider his schoolwork.  He is an indifferent student, but to please his lover he works hard and passes and kept on working hard in school.  He feels so grown up, so much older and different than his schoolmates, than his brother and sisters.<br /><br />Do you want to wear a uniform and punch tickets?  don't you want more than just to be a street car conducter?  There is much sneaking around to meet, lieing to parents, getting to know Hanna.  She had been in the army during the war.  The book takes place not long after the war in Germany.  And Hanna wants her young man to read to her, to make love to her.  The boy becomes interested in school friends, fun and going places, but he still loves Hanna.  Then she disappears.  It is his loss, but possibly better for him.<br /><br />Years pass.  Hanna is in trouble.  She is charged with being an SS Guard.  Many women prisoners were locked inside a church; the church was set on fire.  Hanna is sent to prison for life.<br /><br />There is much discussion about how people can do such terrible acts, have they no humanity, why are they doing as they are ordered to even though they know it is wrong.  The young man visits concentration camps to get the feeling of how it was.<br /><br />As for Hanna, had she had need of the young man, someone to be with her, to read to her, to love and make love to her.  She has used him as she has used others.<br /><br />The young man never stopped loving her, became a loner, could not get close to other women.  He knew a secret about Hanna which had he told she wouldn't have received a life sentence.<br /><br />This is a strange, strong story with a great impact on this reader.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Puzzle variety is great and the different skills needed are fun. Unlike the graphics.  The rewards and collections are cool goals.  The more I play the more I learn about the ins and outs of the strategy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We enjoy the entire production and would very much like to see Season 3 without paying for each episode.  Thank you!
B00009YUPY|5.0|We use these mice at work and when my mouse at home went out, I just decided to get what I'm used to working with. This is not meant to be a gaming mouse, it's just a very sturdy, reliable mouse. Fits very well and is very responsive, nothing else to say!
0547391005|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter and my nephews, a great book with great short stories. this is a hardback book so can be passed along some day to there kids.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Supernatural is the best show ever, that is known of course, but in season 7, I felt like the writers were out of ideas, and I was afraid the show might take the downfall in script quality, but in season 8, all my worries were evaporated, the script, found again its way into our hearts, and made us feel like hunters again!<br /><br />In this season, Winchesters find their own place to call \\"Home\\", since they find out they are the only living members of a cult named \\"Man of Letters\\", imagine a more snobbish way \\"Hunters\\" but they were more than that, anyway, Dean and Sam, found the key to their hideout, and now they stay there, but the problems cannot stop! Crowley is out there to get the Angels tablet, and the two brothers have to translate the tablet quickly, with the help of the prophet Kevin Trann,while a mysterious Metatron makes his appearence and helps Castiel close the gates of Paradise, so humanity can solve their own problems, or is he?. A season full of twists that will make you wanna see season 9 right away! I would recommend it to anyone!
1592407889|1.0|While I have never been a fan of Shirley MacLaine, this book doesn't surprise me. A narcissist should never be a mother...and she wasn't much of one. While giving a con man almost $1 million dollars yearly for decades, she couldn't spend anything to care for her child. Shirley believed his lies....because she was the one person in the world whom extraterrestrials would contact. Appallingly true...she believed it and based her eccentric life on his fabrications all the while affording him a 5-star existence. Who suffered for her blindness? Her daughter, of course. Her daughter, Sachi Parker, blames her acquiescence on her controlled Japanese upbringing. I'm not sure how much of that I believe. The book is written in a martyred point of view. It is galling to see the behavior MacLaine got away with. Where were the Social Services?! Worth the read? Not really. I got quite bored reading about MacLaine's ongoing child abuse without punishment. One word describing this book...\\"ugh\\".
1932100660|5.0|Not only is the information in this book essential for everyone alive who still believes the fallacy that humans need to eat some kind of animal products for health, and everyone else in fact, but it was surprisingly to me very well written, very interesting, and actually a real page turner! He writes in a very humble, paced manner that is extremely interesting and engaging. But even if that were not the case, this information is groundbreaking and essential. Nobody  has studied human nutrition to this depth and magnitude and the results are clear. The only way it could get clearer is if some shining God with a white beard game down on a golden chariot and smacked you over the head with this staff and told you in no uncertain terms what was what. That not being the case, the China Study is the next best thing.
B000005RY7|3.0|I was excited to find this on cassette back in the late 1980's with the German-specific logo on the cover.  The four \\"new\\" songs got heavy rotation and the rest of the collection served its purpose as well.  I also purchased a German-issued CD (in Hawaii of all places, 2006) and recieved a Japanese copy way back when as well.  In 2013, however, this one has been surpassed by any of the many KISS complilations available.  The \\"gold\\" two-disc collection is my recommendation for anyone interested in the band's best.  For the KISS die-hards and collectors though this is essential, if only for the unique cover photo of the very short-lived (and short haired) \\"Elder era\\" look and German logo.  The Japanese issue has the standard logo along with two extra tracks including \\"Escape From the Island\\" from the Elder album (odd but...)  It also contains a fold out lyric sheet in English and Japanese with some interesting translations of the lyrics!  I rate three stars for the overall value, four for the music and five for the cover artwork.
B006AN78XS|5.0|This piece constantly totters that line between fantasy and reality, with both winning - convincingly.<br /><br />I can't say I think Owen Wilson is the top-drawer actor Woody usually demands (and his direction usually requires), but he pulled it off.  AND the usual cast of very strong women actors - brilliantly directed - carried their own weight perfectly.<br /><br />Great music, camera work, writing, and dialog.  Fabulous as usual, Woody.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple relaxing game with plenty of free boards to play. My upper elementary age child likes it as well. Good fun
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Didn't like the start but had me hooked after 25 pages or so.  Fast paced and defiantly eye opening for sure.
B006OZKX02|3.0|I don't know why so many people are surprised it's a Euro version, when the symbol in the bottom left and right says it was rated 12 by the \\"bbfc\\" (The British Board of Film Classification) and the \\"IRISH FILM CLASSIFICATION OFFICE\\", respectively... I agree that the description should be updated, but I also think people should have looked at the fine print, in the picture, before purchasing...<br /><br />So why did I give it a 3-star review, when I didn't even purchase it? Because I wanted to keep the reviews as neutral as possible...
B006S01GH2|5.0|One of my favorites! Audrey Tatou as Amelie is quirky ,cute, but sexy as all get out. LOVE this film!
0345803485|1.0|I was very dissapointed. The book seems to be a woman's fantasy about a relation with a man. A very rich man, very handsome, with his own plane and helicopter who is also a musician and to top it, gives her a great sex. The whole book is about how rich he is and the sex. Nothing about their personal life, about his business. Pure sex fantasies. Very dissapointed!!!
1594203334|5.0|As an american, I definitely felt like I was living in the wrong country after reading this book. There is more than one way to parent and this reassured me that I was not alone in my ideas. Highly recommend!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Awesome movie.<br /><br />Pre-ordered as a prime customer with free two day shipping and it arrived ON release day.  What a surprise, I certainly wasn't expecting that!  Love Amazon &#60;3<br /><br />The movie itself is fantastic, I love how this &#34;new&#34; Star Trek universe is branching out from the original with a little bit of time manipulation.  I'm excited to see what they do for the third installment as they get back to exploring.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I had this case for awhile and I didn't use it, why? I liked all the cutesy phone cases, but one day I wanted to use my phone at a water park and ever since I am in love with this case! You can go into water and pics turn out nice also how many times I forget my phone is on my lap and i get out of the car and still my phone not a scratch after crashing to the pavement.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My suggestion would be to offer two episodes at a time for streaming.<br />Include &#34;making of&#34; segment  at the end of each episode.

B0081J95TE|3.0|I was so excided when I heard that Garbage was making a big comeback. When I heard the first few songs they sounded good, the rest could use some improvement. If your a true fan, it's a solid buy. Newbies, might want to start with their self-titled &#34;Garbage&#34; album and work from there.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I gave it one star only because I really enjoyed using this product while it lasted. Had it all for 5 days when it completely stopped working. No problem, I thought, I will just contact customer service and get a new one shipped out. It has been 2 weeks more than 4 times longer than I had the device and I have had virtually no response from customer service. They still have not authorized a return. This is beyond frustrating and a shame, because it is really a great product when it works. My responses I have received from customer support have been sparse or in my case the last 3 emails I have sent have completely ignored and unanswered. This is not cool, after spending 120 bucks (after shipping) on this product, I am feeling completely ripped off.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Animal lovers must read !  I totally understand their connection . I fell in love with Bob too. I want to know more about them
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book! It has romance, drama, action, suspense. Everything in one! The characters, everything was great. A must read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this game everyday . If you want to cheat use minecraftpocketeditionedior or the pro version. Only if you play on the kindle.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|Gave the trilogy to my niece and husband for Christmas and they watch them over and over again so I would say they're a big hit.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I so much enjoyed the movie.  The way people can get frustrated with life.  It is so much true.  I shared this movie with alot of my friends.  They liked it too.  One of my best movies to watch.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Loved every bit of this disc. I recently had a stressful trip. I listened to these trax the whole time. This disc got me through with sone people asking is that Gregory Porter you listening to again? I think I sold a few copies for you Gregory,  definitely some new fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|COOL GAME WITH VERY TRICKY PROCEDURES TO MAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.<br />PLEASE COME OUT WITH MORE FLOORS, THEY ARE GREAT!!!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Was a really cute game and my 5 year old loved it till we could no longer get onto our reef. We have been trying for a month and every time it says server not available. Apparently other have had this same problem with no solution when they get to the higher levels. If you buy dont get attached to your reef and don't spend real money since at a certain level you might get locked out. I do not have the same problem with the app on my iPod
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good show!!!! Watch a few episodes before bed!! Can't wait to catch up. But then I won't be able to watch the episodes back to back ..... haha!! Harvey and Mike are quite the eye candy!!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I know, where have I been since I've never read a book by Jane Austen? I have watched a ton of movies based on her books, though, and this is probably my favorite, though I really enjoyed Sense and Sensibility also. The most impressive character was probably the hero, though. He was so stuffy and stoical at first, but as he felt more compelled to get to know the heroine and was drawn to her, he softened up quite a bit. It was aggravating how she doubted him so much, but I was delighted when she started to see that out of love he had helped her family numerous times to save their reputations, etc. Kiera did a great job once again, but I really love the guy who played Mr. Darcy. He was excellent!
B00ESY77LO|2.0|The characters were uninteresting, the crowd scenes and fireworks went on forever, the music was inappropriate and the camera work was random.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I thought it was a good dictionary but, there is one thing. WHAT IS WITH ALL THE PAGES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is over 900000 pages. There is more pages in this than the book It. But everything else is good.
B00C8985DU|5.0|The release of &#34;Wings Over America in a 'deluxe' package is a must for all Wings fans. With the near enough to simultaneous release of the full concert on dvd in &#34;Rockshow&#34;, the chronicle of the 1976 tour of the USA is complete.<br /><br />The most important thing to remember is that the 1976 audio and visual trinkets are the only accessible evidence of McCartney's last significant tour as a a performer who was still a rock star in his own right, and who still made an impression on the charts and this reviewer is pleased to have these gems in his possession.<br /><br />The included books of stories and photographs complete the historic value of this collection.<br /><br />In short, it's all a tastefully presented memory of a fabulous era.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Interesting plot with lots of twists and turns, great characters, unique characters, a thrill ride to the very end.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This is a great tower defense game. I've had it installed on all my phones since I got it as a faotd a while back. I thought I would just play it through and be done but I keep coming back to even though I have a ton of other games. The variety of towers, the levels, the creeps, everything comes together to make a very enjoyable game.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|We pre-ordered this film, thinking that we would get it in a timely fashion, or even less expensive than anywhere else.  Never AGAIN!  The movie was in the stores yesterday already and today we get an email saying that it should arrive in 2 days.  Plus, all we've been seeing is sales...Shopko has it for $1 less than Amazon, and Walmart actually has a 2-pack with both of the StarTrek movies in it for $19.99!  Take a wild guess as to what we are going to do....yep, RETURN it!  I would recommend to everyone out there to NEVER pre-order a movie from Amazon!  Just go to the stores and get them on sale..and on the day it is released.

B00008G8LY|1.0|Arghhhhhhh! There are three versions of The Abyss being sold here on Amazon, but Amazon has lumped the reviews for all three together and there's no way to discern which review for which version for most of them. The exceptions are those who are technical and clear (and boy am I learning stuff) so hopefully, I can guess which goes to what. or what goes to which. whatever.<br /><br />Anyhoo, this is extremely annoying when I'm trying to decide which one of the three dvds I want to buy.

B000FC1192|5.0|I love the movie but, this is even better! You really captured the bravery of Coraline. I think you did good!
B001NIAQ9I|4.0|Good songs and choreography, plot is a little thin but this is a classic musical. Well worth your time, especially if you are a Streisand fan.
B00CRJSWBQ|5.0|I expected this to be a perfect setup with the I7-4770K, However it didn't turn out to be that way. Drivers had issues and things were not as smooth as I figured. I ended up having to go to Asus website and download all the drivers and set things up with those as Windows update did a poor job along with how bad windows 8 pro's default ones were. One I got things up and going, things have been good. The Bluetooth is a huge plus it works great with my headphones as well as cell phone and a few other goodies leaving open some USB ports. Theres a lot of settings and things to play with an it makes customizing a lot of fun and useful. This board is for people who are tech knowledged and have ideas what they want to do. I personally don't overclock and I still found many of the settings perfect for my taste. While its easy to setup and use, if your not familiar with clock settings and modes I recommend you stay clear of this as it could be very confusing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Bluetooth<br />Wifi<br />Network<br />User settings<br />Bios<br /><br />Cons:<br />More advanced for the newbies or less knowledged<br />Need to get all drivers as windows update and default ones are terrible
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Smash bring all the specter and backstabbing of a Broadway production that will have you watching as many episodes as the wife/husband will allow. Think Glee for grownups. If you love great singers, great choreography, great acting, and or great comedy/drama then this series is a must see. IMO it is the best show on TV.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|First, let me say I have been a fan of Star Trek since the first series was being broadcast the first time. I've watched all the shows and all the movies. I have seen some episodes and some movies which were awesome, and some which sucked. This one is squarely in the middle. If you were new to the series, this is probably an amazing film. Lot's of action, amazing effects. To me, however, I just can't stand the fact every time someone new comes along, they need to change the established. Like most fans, I accepted the Klingons when they were re-designed for the movies and then the subsequent television shows. Why in the hell did we have to redesign them again? Then, there is the U.S.S. Vengeance. Seriously, we are supposed to believe an Admiral is going off the reservation and building a ship like that without others knowing about it? And if it is an approved ship by Starfleet, I can't imagine it getting the name Vengeance. The Enterprise was a fairly new ship, commissioned just a couple years earlier and we are expected to believe it is that outclassed with new weapons and shields. Seriously, if the Admiralty is concerned about the Klingons enough to authorize the construction of the Vengeance, would they not be upgrading the fleet with improved weapons and shields, if not speed, as the technology becomes available? Enterprise was a new ship with a Captain who just recently saved the Earth from destruction, if that is not a ship likely to face immediate upgrades, I can't imagine which would.<br /><br />And, why in the hell would they park the Enterprise under an ocean? What possible need would there be for something stupid like that? The fact they stopped the volcano was a violation of the Prime Directive, it's all they needed to get Kirk in trouble with Starfleet. They did not need to hide it under a damned ocean. It would be out of sight in orbit.<br /><br />I liked the idea of a reboot, it freed the new series of movies to run in new directions without having toworry about keeping up with almost 50 years of established &#34;history&#34;. But, let's be honest, a change in the timeline would not affect the look of the Klingons. Maybe their ships, though frankly, I don't really see that either, since the timeline change affected mostly the Federation. And what the heck was that with the exploding moon around Kronos? Seriously? We know it did eventually become unstable and receive damage, but, again, that would not have happened at such an accelerated pace because of the affects of the first movie.<br /><br />Oh, and I appreciate the nod to the troops, nice to see from Hollywood, but, no missing scenes? A couple of the cut scenes were very important to the first film, I wonder what else is missing from this film that would fix a few gaps.<br /><br />The good, as I said, it's got a lot of action, a lot of great effects. If you don't take the science to seriously and know nothing of the first 48 years of Star Trek, you'll probably love this movie. The scene of the Enterprise rising out of the ocean and later rising from the clouds, reminiscent of the rising from the dust cloud in space, is beautiful, and if you suspend your imagination, you'd enjoy it. The actors are great, the story is certainly interesting. Again, you have to avoid giving it any thought, but, frankly, most action movies suffer from that as well. I wish the creative team would try to keep some things the way we fans have grown to love it, but, it was a fun movie. I look forward to the next one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Highly recommend it. I wish it never ended but the ending was the Best part
1609611543|5.0|My book arrived very quickly. It was new and contained just the information I was looking for. I've promised to send it on to my gluten intolerant grandson as soon as I'm finished. Would recommend the book to any interested person.

B005H9B2CE|5.0|I like this picture because of the theme, and messages.  To summarize: if you want to be better you have to be humble, If you want to be supreme you have to sacrifice yourself and live to serve, and science and magic are the same...

B0024FA9IM|2.0|When this movie was first released there was a massive promotion that really in the end overhyped the movie. I guess they had to because it was a big budget remake and they were banking on the nostalgia of the television fans of the classic TV series. Sadly the movie holds very little in way of similarities to the 60's show, and got lost in it's own desperation to be a new, hip and exciting reimage.  To start off with the script... well has to be one of the worst I have seen for a major motion picture. No plot development to speak of for most the film. No character development. Not even a fascinating premise. I mean what were they thinking?!? The movie actually felt like watching three episodes of a badly written tv series that end up going nowhere. Aside from some half-witted attempt to bring the whole thing together as a family bonding film there's no cohesion at all. Here's the gist of the story: Family Robinson and company take to the stars, get lost, stumble onto a mini-monster movie, then find a planet with some time warp nonsense and a surprise monster to fight. Sure there is an attempt at some story or plot development, but it's woefully inadequate and almost feels like an afterthought or an excuse to create another monster (to fight).  The next problem are the actual people we are supposed to root and empathize with feel two dimensional. Character development has been whittled down to these: A self-absorbed scientist/dad, a boy genius who gets no attention, a daughter typical teen girl growing pains, a forgettable wife/mom along side an equally forgettable adult daughter, a war hero with a one track mind, and the most aggravatingly simplistic villain I have seen in years. Oh yes. Don't get me started on Dr. Smith. They should have just given him a thin dark mustache and a black hat and cape for all motivation he has to be evil. I get the singular motivations at the beginning of the film, but why does he keep being evil? No real explanation about it. It seems the writers are too dense to make the character believable or try to give any depth in him.  While I think the writing for the characters was horrible the acting was not. The whole cast hit their marks splendidly. As much as I hate how Dr. Smith was developed as a character Gary Oldman hits the mark in taking the prudish tendencies of the character while still giving him that dangerous slant. Matt LeBlanc surprised me as an action hero and tries to put more depth on the character. I know William Hurt can act, but this time his character is so dry. It just seems such a waste to see such good talent playing their parts full tilt on such an undeserving script. While Lost in Space has a dynamic list of talented actors they didn't have much to work with.  The special effects are hit and miss. All the special effects for the spaceships and planets and stuff like that look awesome. Anything that interacts with the live actors is very weak by comparison. This is especially true for the creatures of this movie. There are these alien spiders that have a look that makes them feel incomplete. Much worse is the alien monkey &#34;Blarp&#34;, who looks like he is still in the CG developmental stage, as the animation and details on this character is woefully substandard. CG images for the space station show a bit of underdevelopment too while the cityscapes didn't seem to have that limitation. I don't know if they ran out of money to refine the computer animation or not, but it sure looks like a rush job.   Design for the special effects or the technology is widely hit and miss with some awesome concepts along with ones that make me roll my eyes when I see them. Some detail is made on the technology side that did make me want to know more. On the other hand few bits of technology they showcased are just not believable, and look like the movie is trying to cash in on other successes (i.e. the Stargate movie's mask/collar effect). Also the new design for the robot just didn't do itfor me. It was like they were trying to go as far away from the original robot design while still making some backhanded tribute to it. I guess if you take the robot at face value without any preconceptions it is actually one of the better designs. At least there are more good techie things that I admit are way cool than the bad ones. The sci-fi guns are as neat as they are functional looking. The spaceships are also way cool; especially the bubble fighter that you see briefly at the beginning.  This Blu-Ray release will appear to be just a re-release of the previous BD a while back. The video unfortunately will be the same. While the high definition transfer isn't really bad it's not all that impressive either. You have a detailed picture, and while some scenes do stand out lots of it just doesn't come alive. I can't put my finger on it, but odds are no remastering was done to improve on this vague assessment. Audio will be identical too with DTS-HD MA 5.1 surround that WILL come alive. Special features are the same ones from way back to the DVD release. That means standard definition features and absolutely no new content. Here is a breakdown of the features:  Commentary with Director Stephen Hopkins and Writer/Producer Akiva Goldsman - Standard commentary that hits all the marks for production notes, development origins, and that sort of thing.  Commentary with Production and Specal Effects team - This is the commentary for film production fans. Lots of deep details.  Building the Special Effects - Interviews with effects team and some pre-prodution footage of some effects in action.  The Future of Space Travel - Not really related to the movie at all. It's a speculative science discussion that covers topics from social and environmental implications to theoretical travel technologies.  Deleted Scenes - I'll be honest. I never looked at them, but there is a selection of deleted scenes you can view totaling about 12 minutes.  Q&A with the Original Cast: TV Years- An all too short feature with cast from the original show talking about its impact. They don't mention the new movie.  Lost In Space music video performed by Apollo Four Fourty  Movie Trailers  Lost in Space has some good things going for it, but it also has a LOT of disappointing things as well. If neato effects and space toys are your cup of tea you might not mind the lack of a good script much. On the other hand if you need a decent story to enjoy the movie then don't bother with this one. For the average sci-fi viewer I say go ahead and check it out as a rental or if it's on cable. Just don't expect something as big as the hype that came at the movie's release.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a pretty good game if you enjoy hidden object games and mysteries. You can purchase objects with your own money, but if your patient enough the energy does restore after a few hours. Great game for passing time. Once you understand how the game works, it's pretty easy.

B0093OGBL6|5.0|With this book the Author Karen Moriarty has written a compassionate & sometimes heartbreaking portrayal of Michael Jackson's life & legacy. With every stroke of her pen, you can feel & almost see the Love she has for Michael pouring over the pages. Never have I read such a compelling book about Michael Jackson.One that has had me totally drawn into every page. A book I simply couldn't put down. Each page just begs you to continue. She gives in-depth explanations to some of the major aspects of the later years of Michael's life.This gives the reader a insight on what it was like to be him.This book is a definite must have for his fans. I would even go so far as to say for those who didn't like Michael for any reason, then this may be a book for you as well. Actually reading this book and learning about all that Michael had to endue in his life,having this knowledge actually may change your views about Michael. The real man behind the mask. Not the man the media portrayed.  NOTE TO THE AUTHOR..  Karen Moriarty I Loved the book Karen & can not thank you enough for such an insight into Michaels life. Reading it you get totally wrapped up within it..You take the reader through so many emotions. Its like been on an emotional roller-coaster, heart-wrenching at times, yet you feel you need to continue your journey. I stand up & applaud you on this beautiful book.. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Xxx
140006922X|4.0|I never had any intention of reading Zealot.  I probably would never have heard of it were it not for the cringe-worthy interview of the author by Fox News correspondent, Lauren Green. She is single handedly responsible for publicizing the book to an extent that any author or public relations firm could only dream about. The only things you could be sure of at the conclusion of the interview were that Aslan is a well-educated scholar and a class act and Green is a religiously-biased idiot who clearly had not read the book.<br /><br />After seeing the interview, I went out on Amazon to read the reviews. The first thing I noticed was that the older reviews tended to be serious, well-written, and generally clustered in the four to five star range. The newer reviews were mostly one star, clearly written by people who had not read Zealot, and were noteworthy for rehashing Fox talking points.<br /><br />I posted comments challenging the \\"reviewers\\" where it was obvious that he or she had not read the book and I tracked the responses. I challenged one reviewer, who took offense at the book's imagined attack on his deeply-held religious beliefs, to actually read the book and post a real review, which I promised to read with an open mind. He agreed to do so, and then challenged me to do the same. Fair enough. I bought my hard copy from Amazon the same day.<br /><br />I procrastinated reading the book, looking forward to it with the same level of enthusiasm I would have for a root canal. I'm sorry I did. It is an engaging and well-written book that makes history come alive for those of us who are not religious scholars. This book will keep your attention because it is interesting.<br /><br />I was sucked in by the first sentence and was happily surprised to find that in addition to being meticulously researched, this book is an enjoyable read. Zealot is a story about Jesus of Nazareth - not Jesus the Christ - placed in historical context. It debunks some oft-repeated beliefs that may make devout Christians uncomfortable, but is in no way an attack on their faith.<br /><br />Jesus was a Jew who was almost certainly born in Nazareth, not Bethlehem; he was dirt poor and probably illiterate; he had brothers and sisters; and he was baptized by, and was a disciple of John the Baptist. While there is every reason to believe he was crucified, that in no way made him special; at the time, crucifixion was a common punishment meted out by the Roman occupiers in staggering numbers. For that reason, the probability that he appeared before Pontius Pilate to be judged is vanishingly small.<br /><br />Jesus of Nazareth was just one more in a long line of rebellious \\"messiahs\\" railing against the Roman occupation of Judea and the corrupt high priests who controlled the temple in Jerusalem. Jesus wanted the Romans to leave, the corrupt priests out of the Temple, and the land returned to God (an earthly kingdom as opposed to the heavenly kingdom that later Gospels proclaimed).  Jesus was crucified for sedition - for taking this message on the road, fomenting insurrection.<br /><br />This book places Jesus of Nazareth and his life and death in historical context. Little to nothing was written about him in his lifetime; the Gospels were written long after he had died. It is what happened after Jesus' death that is noteworthy. His brother, James the Just along with the apostles continued Jesus' message of Torah-based Judaism. Jesus never claimed he was the Son of God, but rather the Son of Man. Taken to its logical conclusion, this version of Christianity would have been just another Jewish sect that almost certainly would have disappeared over time.<br /><br />Modern Christianity (or at least the seeds of it) was a product of the repackaging of Jesus' life by Paul (Saul of Tarsus). He never met Jesus, had no use for Jewish tradition, and reinterpreted the story of Jesus' life and death making him appear to be a man of peace and love and more otherworldly -the Son of God. Paul's Christianity was a new religion that was less reliant on the laws of Moses, more palatable to Rome, and more likely to attract better-educated, non-Jewish converts. Despite the concerted efforts of James the Just, Paul's largely-fabricated version of the life and death of Jesus gradually became the accepted version.<br /><br />Devout Christians reading this book will find that it is not an attack on or a threat to their faith. This is a book about a famous man placed in context historically. It fleshes out and complements the stories in the Bible. As an example, Aslan makes no attempt to debunk the Resurrection, but rather says that it is a matter of faith. He does note that many people who claimed to have seen the resurrected Jesus were later executed just for saying so. They could have been spared their fate had they recanted. None did. They had everything to gain and nothing to lose by denying what they said they had seen, but they would not because it was something they had actually experienced and not just heard about secondhand. There is still room for mystery and you can make of that what you will.<br /><br />This was an excellent, well-written, thought-provoking book. If you want to learn something, read it.<br /><br />(By way of background, I was raised Catholic, attended Catholic schools through high school, and all of the colleges I attended were secular by choice. By the time I graduated high school, I considered myself agnostic on a good day and leaning atheist the rest of the time. Still do.)the Son of God.

B007JWKLMO|5.0|I owned this DVD when it first came out and gave it to George Harrison fan and ordered another for my self.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|While researching all the Websites and Reviews I could find, looking for the one large bladed knife that I would want to have with me whenever I'm in the great outdoor's, one knife kept coming up, The Becker BK2. I've never seen or held one in person prior to ordering mine so I was a little hesitant opening the box when it arrived, upon opening the box and finally holding this blade my first thought was &#34; THIS A BEAST&#34;.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into detail about the BK2 because there is literally hundreds and thousands of reviews and videos of this blade from unboxing, modifications and/or to putting this beast to work. This is the knife you want if you want one to survive pretty much anything you can throw at it to passing it on to the next generation.<br /><br />I am very, very, happy with my purchase.<br /><br />Caveat: The only downside I can see is if you are wanting something lightweight or you have small hand's other than that this blade was made for the outdoor's.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is different from other  ball target games.  Lots of fun.  Cute graphics too.  Enjoy playing this when I don't want to think real hard !!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great app, i highly suggest it to anyone instrested in building and mining or surviving off your resourses. it wouldbe nice if they update it more often and mojang hurrys up and gets that update t 0.7.5 before apple. just to sum it all up, great app should get high price hat every one is waiting for. apple udates more than amazon but for one that i know of it updated
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|There are already so many reviews for this book, I will keep mine simple.<br /><br />This book was a lot of fun. :-)
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|my boys love this game one is 4 and one is 6. The game is great for long car rides or trips.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra Clare never stops coming up with wonderful ideas for her books. It was very well organized and had a lot of startling twists that surprised me. Clary is developed more as a person and so does Simon.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Picked up the UK version as it came out almost a full month ahead and plus had the other two movies in HD (not a huge fan of part 2 or Ariel's Beginnings, but my niece loves them).  After watching the blu ray digital remaster the other day, the transition to hi-def is pretty amazing compared to the HD telecast from a few years ago... the colors are much more vibrant and the 7.1 sound is crisp.  There are very minor differences with the original version that most might not notice, but among the ones that I do remember, the intro credits are slightly different and an out of sequence scene at the end of \\"Part of Your World\\" (uncertain if this will be corrected for the US release, but I'm assuming all discs have been mastered, printed and ready to be shipped).  And while I feel that the Lion King (even Beauty and the Beast) were better remasters in terms of picture quality, The Little Mermaid is one of my favorite movies of all time, let alone Disney classics and cannot wait to see how the 3D version of the film holds up.<br /><br />The extras are plentiful, which contains a lecture from Howard Ashman (producer), a short storyboard of a deleted scene starring Harold the Merman, an interview with Jodi Benson (the voice of Ariel), a featurette about how live action reference was utilized for the film, as well as a few others and also contains extras from the dvd (I didn't bother watching the Carly Rae Jepsen version of \\"Part of Your World\\" even though I'm a sucker for \\"Call Me Maybe\\" :p).<br /><br />This is a great movie to pick up as most children nowadays know of The Little Mermaid, but often don't get the chance to see the movie because of the scarcity (limited release because of the Disney Vault) and now is their chance to enjoy this classic as we did when we were little ones.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|what can one say! best fairy tale told in  years and years. dazzling beauty and story that will smile on you.
B0007KIFGO|5.0|very pleased
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Good book ! Easy light hearted book ! Quirky and funny ! Definitely a bit like the catcher and the rye !
B00EEN7CAK|1.0|It's kind of boring. This obviously would make a way better article as it started out to be. There isn't  a lot in between them committing the crimes and going to court. It's like two slices of bread with nothing in the middle
0425266060|5.0|I was looking for a book similar to fifty shades and let me tell you Gideon Cross is sexier and dreamier....
B00DSTBMMU|2.0|Gave two stars just because I can't bring myself to give Crow only one.  I had hoped that she would do a more traditional country roots sound.  This has today's gosh awful country pop sound.  It's not quite so hick as some current hits, but it's not at all what I hoped.
B005UG542S|5.0|I work a lot so I rarely get to see movies when they're still in the theater.  I read and enjoyed each book as they came out and there was a HP marathon ending with DH I so I decided to start my vacation with this movie.<br /><br />It was brilliant-I think my favorite part was Harry reviewing Snapes memories.  To see Snape as he was instead of how he presented himself and to hear his own death sentence but still carry on underscored the courage Harry has shown all along.  I may buy it because I'd like to see it again-for now I'm going to reread the books.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Shipment was speedy. The product itself works great, just wish the description mentioned that it was a mini dvi and not just a dvi cable. Couldn't use it on an older Mac.
006212725X|3.0|I READ THE ENTIRE BOOK AND FOR ME IT WAS A VERY HARD READ JUST LIKE PETE HIMSELF. THE BOOK NEVER SEEMED TO GET REALLY INSIDE  WHAT WAS HAPPENING  BUT SEEMED TO JUST GIVE  A LITTLE LOOK INSIDE . I FINISHED THIS BOOK WITH NOT REALLY KNOWING PETE THE MAN .. TOO BAD
B00AEFYJZ8|5.0|Great wonderful love story. It's been a long time since I saw it when it originally released but it's just as good today as it was then.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies, watched it twice in a week. Anthony Hopkins is a very good actor and most of his movies are usually pretty good.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Love this CD! Dowloadex it for misery and fell in love with the rest of the CD!!!! Everyone should buy it!
B000MV8ABS|4.0|Ironic that the two scariest movies that I've ever seen both used the same mansion set. This movie is a classic and the scene at the end when he's pulled through the mirror is still scary 30 years later.
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Roy Huff has created and crafted a spellbinding tale, with well written characters that engage your mind; and have you turning the pages and keep you enthralled to the end of this story and leave you wanting more.<br /><br />As Owen Sage and his friends Anika and Dante prepare to attend college, first Owen and then his pals are drawn into an alternate world; and a battle of good versus evil.<br /><br />As Owen is drawn mentally to Everville he meets the Keeper who shows Owen how evil and the dark forces have begun to invade Everville, and how these actions will also impact the world in which Owen lives.<br /><br />As the three friends begin their college lives they are drawn to classes and clubs that help to prepare them to assist the Fron in the war against their enemies the Them.<br /><br />As Owen travels between the two worlds he learns more of the history of this ongoing battle between the forces of good and evil as the Keeper allows Owen to read the Keeper's mind.

B008469DGY|5.0|would have given this great game a five star rating if it had another view setting - ha, I'm giving it five stars anyways,  this golf game is unique
B000001EUP|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of metal. I do like what I like. And I DO like Scorpions' Blackout.  This is some hard charging music and it's definitely worth having in your library.  You don't have to be a serious fan of metal to like it either.  It'll grab you by the short 'n curlies and get you rockin'.<br /><br />No One Like You probably sold me on the album. And I have to admit, I like that art cover too. I suggest giving them a listen and see if you think they belong in your stereo. I know they belong in mine.
B000002B30|5.0|This is my favorite album by the Boss.  All the songs stand the test of time . . . enough said.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was spell bound all the way thru this book! I hope the author keeps writing more! I am now on the second book in the series and it's just as good.
B0000025KI|5.0|The River has some of Springsteen's greatest songs.  The song &#34;The RIver&#34; is pure poetry.  This is a must have for all Springsteen fans.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|It's borderline pop, a genre that I don't really like, but Gaga always makes it excellent. She is such an amazing artist!
0375842209|1.0|It is totally beyond me why this book getting such good reviews. As a German I find the flat stereotypes unbearable. The author inserts German words all the time, probably to make the novel more authentic, however very often his vocabulary is used incorrectly, is misspelled or grammatically wrong. There is profanity from start to end, it is German profanity and maybe the English reader isn't feeling the impact because it is not his native language, but imagine someone writing the f... word all the time and cursing on the lowest social level, that gets old very quickly. The book is filled with typical 3rd Reich, Nazi, Bavarian stereotypes, the writing style wants to be different and extraordinary, but having said everything above, it is flat out boring, insulting and annoying. The story has been told a million times already, so I think don't waste your money and time.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Buyer BEWARE... after a very long wait, the MDNA tour is available - on a defective release.  The 5.1 sound is defective - the only way to somewhat enjoy watching is to play the sound on the 2.0 sound option.  Apparently, this is an issue with copies of the Blu Ray and DVD across the globe.  Disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game that makes you think. Not just a point and shoot. You need to use your brain and not just your finger.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was very interesting I recommend this book to kids who like action and adventure. This book is recommended from 3rd-6th
B00936A0RU|5.0|A solid movie though well deserving of an R rating--parents beware.  Some scenes are quite raw and I wish they had been edited out, but the remainder contains memorable performances of characters who are more complex than one might first imagine.  If you like sheer physicality, heroes who walk softly but carry a big stick, you'll love this movie.
B00992CF6W|3.0|id say its an ok game.the only thing I could think of to make it better is to have less pixels
0143124544|5.0|Read it!<br /><br />This is not a \\"romance\\" novel, but it is an extraordinary love story. It's not \\"women's fiction\\", but a story about the human condition that anyone can read and be moved by.<br /><br />Me Before You asks what is \\"quality of life\\" and who decides when that quality is so diminished life isn't worth living? Who has a \\"right to die\\"? Who has the right to make that decision? There are no simple answers in this story and the issue is not one-sided. Each character has their own beliefs and those are presented, not as right or wrong, but simply how that character believes.<br /><br />You may read this book and agree or disagree with characters and the choices they make, but you won't read this book and be unmoved.<br /><br />\\"I told him a story of two people. Two people who shouldn't have met, and who didn't like each other much when they did, but who found they were the only two people in the world who could possibly have understood each other.\\"
B0064X7FVE|4.0|When you want weather forecasts that are easy to read and navigate, the wc app is best. For travel you can set it to wherever you go and still know what's happening at home.
B008JFUR10|3.0|given the limited amount of time for character development, they really needed to go w/ a known box office Star in the male lead. I thought the Japanese female Jaeger partner was a good fit, and then Idris Elba is a known presence, though I think rather underemployed in this. The Jaeger-Kaiju fight scenes were very well done, but then 'Hannibal Chow' was not used effectively either, as Perlman is a known presence and capable of better input. All over, a good movie... could/should have been better.
B00CTT9646|5.0|The phaser is heavy duty, well designed and well built. Not at all a plastic peace of crap, which I was kind of afraid of because of the low cost. QMX makes great replicas.<br /><br />The movie of course is awesome, great for 3D.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is a movie is awesome! I'm so glad martin scorcese finally won a well deserved Oscar for it! Its a must have addition to your video library, Its definitely a new crime classic! Like scarface, the Godfather etc.. Its well written screenplay is based in part on bostons one & only whitey bulger (leader of the winter hill gang) Its acting at its finest, as well as directing!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love waking up to my personalized clock. Makes waking up to my favorite music more pleasant than some annoying alarm blaring in your ears.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|We think we have everything figured out and that we have control of our lives but we don't. We are at the mercy of others and sometimes our lives takes a turn we cannot control. We must take each day as it comes and enjoy life's blessings as they come. Live in the moment not dreaming about the future because all we truly have is the now.
B00CTT9646|4.0|No question, the movie is great and if you saw it in the theater of course you'll buy it.  So the question is, should I pay the extra $50 for the phaser?  Well, just so you know the coloring of the phaser I received is not exactly the same as the picture.  The picture shows a dark grey almost black cover to the phaser while the actual color is a very light grey - lighter than almost any other part of the phaser.  The flip around muzzle (between kill and stun setting) moves manually as stated.  No button to flip it around.  And there is no trigger for the phaser.  How they fired it without a trigger in the movie is beyond me, but that can probably be explained away by Trek technology.  The muzzle is very slightly off kilter in stun mode where it lifts up, but I imagine that's how it holds in place so nicely instead of freely spinning.  Overall, it's a very nice replica with very solid construction.  It feels heavy in your hand (not in a bad way but in a high quality way).  This is not some cheap toy but a very precise model.  If you have always wanted a phaser, this is a great one to get.  Is it worth $50?  Yes, but only for the hard core Star Trek fan who wants the collectible.  Otherwise, stick to getting the $20 version.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is great keeps you mind alert and gives you good time to keep play with need to buy much..
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Love it! Glad the backstreet boys are still around after 20 years and still making awesome music. Forever a BSB fan!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson books there a awesome read I think every one should read them at least one time
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I give this album 5 stars due to the fact that you cannot find any other album from the 80's that has had more popularity and prestige than this one.and it still brings back memories why this album went platinum.
B007X4ECMI|4.0|Who would think Guy Pearce could be a buffed up action hero. His attitude and dry sense of humor make the movie.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I give this a good rating cuz if you're a fan of 80's music you'll enjoy this,don't forget to check out the movie as well
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I start reading so many books and then end up finishing them out of some type of duty, rather than interest. But, The Husband's Secret held my attention to the very end!! The epilogue was a bit much, but the rest of it was so compelling!!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I really loved this movie. It is so refreshing to watch a flick that can make me laugh out loud and cry like a baby! Loved the stories in this film and the characters. Great movie!
B001FB4W02|5.0|The show keep getting better and better with every season! You can see Clark 1 strep to become Super Man! Nice to see Green Arrow become 1 of the main stars! Lots of super  fights!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I'm a science fiction fan no doubt. I found the movie to be very entertaining and given the time frame when it was shot I found it within the realm of possibility. I was very pleased. I liked the actors and I thought the plot was pretty genuine. However I never did understand the anger directed at the professor. by the military unit. That almost ruined the film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a very challenging game.this is a mind game for sure it makes you think very hard. Great game.
B008NMT684|4.0|My kids love this app. I just hate all the pop up trying to make you buy more puzzles. All in all it is a very effective applocation. We would love to see more like it' but with no pop ups.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is truly amazing! Wow!! Love everything about it and CANNOT wait to start the next book! It is definitely a must read.
B00AEFYXD6|4.0|Moves fast which was good for the two and four year old.  At times didn't understand what was happening but the next time they will understand.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The idea of changing history and making it better has no doubt crossed everyone's mind at least once. This is a tale of what happens if we succeed. Captivating characters. Fantastic story. Engaging from start to finish.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Great  Really made my four year old laugh.  I had to laugh watching him get tickled.  Great Great Great Work
B00A3AY134|4.0|I glad that 3 doors down came out with a greatest hits lately I have been going for the greatest hits
B000MV9026|3.0|Moved kinda slow at times.  Sometimes hard for the young ones to understand what is happening.  Really like some of the characters.
B002YOKVU4|5.0|Literally the best movie ever made. If you into counter culture this is a must watch. Flawless performance by both Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro.
B000AY74OG|5.0|Great....Keeps my 4 year old entertained.  It really got his tickle button going.  Watching him laugh was great.  It made me laugh
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie takes you into a stunning new world that is beautiful and the colors are out of this world. No brainer on this one!
B00CPLGFII|5.0|This is a really good CPU.  I have built two PC's with this processor and<br />they are trouble free and very fast.  The built in graphics processor is impressive.<br /><br />I am not a gamer, but playing HD movies on multiple screens is possible with this unit.<br /><br />For any budget builder you can put together a low cost system for about $350 with this<br />chip.  Make sure you have 8GB of memory or more to optimize performance.  You will get<br />about a 15-20% improvement over 4GB or main memory.<br /><br />You won't be able to build a comparable Intel unit unless you are willing to spend $500<br />or more. Which is why I still use AMD CPU's.  For budget builds they are the best.<br />Many of my systems are still running 5 years later & longer.<br /><br />If you mainly use your machine for surfing, viewing movies, photo's, & documents<br />then this is a really impressive machine.  It handles multi-tasking really well.<br />You can have Anti-virus software scanning, and de-frag the HD and still surf without<br />any lag.
1444737090|5.0|Good Book...I was not disappointed.  I think any one who likes cats will probably enjoy reading the book also like me.
B001A50716|5.0|I love Johnny Depp and collecting all his movies, this all except one more completes my collection. I am pleased
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Love the dystopian universe Mr. Howey created in this book. He reveals the back story slowly, letting the reader figure out via clues as to the nature of characters and events. I admit I thought this was too dark at one point, but it is wonderful.
0061122416|5.0|Super awesome story, this is the fifth time I read it, and I got all kinds of new wisdoms out of it! A must read!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Such a beautiful story.  One of those books you read when you most need to. Thank you Mr Stein, this made a difference to me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A well thought out app, nicely laid out encouraging you to read your bible more.  I especially love the plans. A true blessing!
B007F7XXKA|5.0|This is a wonderful and brief overview of political and economic environment in different emerging and frontier markets. It is insightful and perhaps may be an essential reading for anyone looking to invest in these markets.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game is both fun and challenging. I like the graphics and use of colors. I wish there was a cumulative score. There are many levels even on the free version.
B004J00KJ8|5.0|Supper fun with Hugh Grant and cast is this special edition format.  The Blu-ray has outstanding quality.<br />Great price!<br />Great purchase!
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Great movie with a lot of great stars. I've pre ordered Red 2, not coming out until Nov/Dec. Great Movie.
B00DNDR29I|4.0|Where do I begin?  This album is just divine.  It's Funk, Jazz and Soul at it's finest.  Honestly, I don't listen to Janelle Monae for her concepts of Cindi Mayweather, I'm just a fan of her music.  With that said, I'm no fan of the DJ interludes on this album either.  So, let's review the music.<br /><br />The opening of Suite IV puts me in the Land Of Oz, what a great introduction.<br />Every collaboration in this suite is infectious and just AWESOME.  Prince is a genius and I'm infected with pure funk on Givin em what you love. I just Love Love Looooovvvvveeeeee.  Q.U.E.E.N  featuring Erykah Badu is just a monster jam, makes me want to shake my booty.  The Electric Lady featuring Solange is Soul at it's best.  I'm taken back to a time when I wasn't even born but it still feels familiar and I like it.  It's just so smooth.  The BEST collabo is by far PrimeTime featuring Miguel.  I truly thought he was overrated but I cannot deny the beauty of this song, their voices or the message.  This is my favorite song out of both suites, hands down, even if it wasn't Janelle's intention, it's the perfect homage to Prince.  We were Rock n' Roll has to grow on me still.  I don't hate it but it just didn't click with me for some reason.  Dance Apocalyptic is the 60's inspired tune that seems to fit right in 2013.  I really like this track.  Look into my eyes is a beautiful track, I just love what Janelle Monae can do with her voice.  She is so gifted and I had this song on repeat for so long. What a beautiful way to close that suite.<br /><br />Suite V is so pretty.  I love how she has fused her influences of Michael Jackson, The Jacksons, Stevie Wonder and jazz in this suite.  I honestly love this suite, her voice truly shines in it.  It's Code is 70's funk and MJ/Sly Stone at it's best.  This is my favorite song in this suite.  Ghetto Woman is a nice tribute to her mom, very Stevie Wonder.  I like that I can dance to this and have fun. Victory is a sexy song, reminds me of The Sweetest Thing by Lauren Hill and again her voice is just incomparable.  Can't Live Without Your Love is another MJ/Stevie inspired jam and flows nicely in this suite.  Sally Ride and Dorothy Dandridge Eyes featuring Esperanza Spalding are the best tribute songs I've ever heard, pure enlightenment, funk and jazz done just right.  What an experience took me a few listens to appreciate it but I honestly like the different elements that are found in this song.  The gospel, the funk, the reggae.  This girl has such an appreciation of soul music and it truly shows.  This suite truly is Soul music, her definition of soul is what feeds your actual soul as a person, not the genre per se.<br /><br />Minus the interludes, I have never cared for them on anyone's album, this album is honestly the best to come out this year.  I recommend it to anyone who loves good music.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie to add to my video collection. I'm a die hard fan of star trek, like star wars, but love star trek. Just received this movie in the mail. First day out for retail. Recommend to all.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie. It is best to just ignore spoilers and go blindly into this movie. It will require you to pay close attention to the characters and what's happening. A very intellectual story. Nicely done.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|This lens cap fit my Nikon lenses for my D5100 just perfect.  Came on time and the price was just perfect as compared to going out and buying them at a camera shop locally.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|For some reason this movie instantly reminds me of Ray Bradbury and his book &#34;The Martian Chronicles&#34;. Now I know the story is nowhere close to what Bradbury was portraying, it was just the spirit of how this story unfolds. The special effects were great and I found this movie to be entertaining all the way through. If you enjoy a good sci-fi end of humanity story then this is the one for you. I love the ending.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was an intellectual &#34;workout&#34; which kept my attention throughout the entire book. It was difficult to read a little bit at a time as the story line was so engaging
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a great story with many twist throughout. It was an easy read and kept me interested at all times. The book is an eye opener to how things used to be for both slaves and their owners. People have compared it to The Help, which is true in that the main character is very strong-willed, but the story line is completely different and takes place in a completely different time. My friend recommended this book to me, and I will pass on her recommendation as being one of the better books I have read in a long time.
0385523394|5.0|Sweet, fascinating, crisply written account of a year in a women's prison.  Surprisingly heartwarming.  A beautiful book that everyone should read.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I use it for gaming and calls on my home computer but when it comes to voice acting I need to use my yeti mic.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I wish I had known Betty Smith in real life.  This was an amazing book, covering all types of social issues such as poverty, unfaithfulness, survival, rape, pedophilia, incest, and ethnic intolerance from a time when people didn't talk or write about these issues in a realistic way.  After reading this book,  I read that she could not get interest in her autobiography, and was suggested to her to change it into a story.  My goodness, what a life for this woman.  Every woman's heart will be warmed and life will be inspired by this little book.
B008GANNIC|5.0|Amazing lyircs and music. Everything is heart felt and has so much passion that shines through each and every song. I give this record a 10 out of 10. It's all killer no filler, no need to skip any song. Just push play and let the music flow. Pick this album up, do yourself this favor.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great read.....don't miss this early adventure of Jack Reacher.  Action packed and keeps you guessing the whole way through. You won't be sorry.
B004SBX112|5.0|I played one season and loved it.  My husband has taken over my kindle.  He's totally addicted.  Well I can't put it down either when I get my hands on it.  Great quality of entertainment for the price.  I downloaded it a few days ago and it's been heavily used.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Angry Birds.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Not as arresting as The Kite Runner, but a very good read. Gives a window into a different world; and how people evolve, for good or worse.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|So disappointed!  Like everyone else I, too, got a defective disc.  No audio from the right channel.  Bass is tinny and her voice is mixed horribly.  Echoing like crazy.. like your sitting in the last row and at times (her vocal) the only thing you can hear.  Not cute.  On top of that the picture is filtered/processed to the max! Extremely washed out.  Overexposed to the point that all you can see is Madonna's eyes and lips.  And the editing.. OMG!  I follow her on facebook and remember her posting how hard they were working on the editing and equalizing of the colors and picture.  She personally oversaw the production of MDNA.  WTH!?  The camera never stays put for more than a few seconds.  It truly makes you dizzy.<br /><br />I saw this tour from her Golden Triangle and it was freaking amazing!  I planned a whole party around the release of this bluray.  I have a reference quality system.  Sticky & Sweet is one of the most amazing concerts.  I play it all the time for people and they are blown away.  Crystal clear picture and the most amazing sound!<br /><br />Amazon is sending me another copy but I don't have high hopes.  I guess I can live with the picture but the lack of a right channel of sound along with no bass completely ruins the experience.  I bet you Madonna is furious right now.  Her fans certainly are.  There should be an address where you mail this defective disc and get a guaranteed non-defective replacement.  Looks like I'll be cancelling my viewing party.  Ugh!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br /><br />Well I got my replacement/second copy and it's another dud!  Frustrating.  How many copies will I go through before I get a good one?!  Here's hoping to third times the charm.  BTW, this is not unique to Amazon.  Best Buy is dealing with the same issue.  Can somebody get this fixed please?!<br /><br />**UPDATE 2**<br /><br />I'm SOL at this point.  They are not even gonna try a third time.  They have canceled my order and refunded my money.  So much for the getting the best price when I preordered.  Damn, I want a good copy!  Don't know what to do at this point.  :(<br /><br />The response I received:<br /><br />\\"I'm sorry to hear the replacement order of \\"Madonna: The MDNA Tour [Blu-ray] \\" had the same problem as your first order. This usually doesn't happen. Since it's likely another replacement would arrive incorrect, I won't trouble you with another replacement.\\"<br /><br />\\"While we investigate the problems you experienced, \\"Madonna: The MDNA Tour [Blu-ray]\\" will be unavailable for purchase from Amazon.com. However, you may be able to purchase it from another seller on our website. If you see this item offered by Amazon.com again in the future, you'll know we've fixed the problem.\\"

1572814136|4.0|When I started getting serious about reading tarot cards a year ago I deliberately avoided Rider Waite Smith decks, including all of its modern remakes. I'd tried to learn tarot with a RWS deck (the Original, as in, the new ones that are made to look like old ones) but it never went well. So, my first few decks were not of the RWS variety, except for the fact that they were based upon RWS decks for the sake of symbolism.<br /><br />Having gotten a firmer grip on my understanding of the cards, I realized that I probably should have some kind of RWS deck in my stash. After all, it is THE deck, the deck of all decks, the deck that has inspired nearly every other deck we have available today. After making this decision, I decided that I don't want the actual original RWS deck unless I could find one from the 80s or earlier (the newer ones are even more unappealing to me!).<br /><br />I did a ton of research and looked at various newer versions of the deck. After hours of frantic Googling it came down to this or the Universal. The Universal looks nice but too soft. A few cards in particular from this deck jumped out at me when I saw them online and it really sealed the deal(The Devil, Ace of Swords, The Tower, to name a few). Since receiving them, I can say that I'm pretty content with my purchase. The vibrantly recolored images are pretty close to the artwork found in a traditional RWS deck, but it does have a few differences which is why it gets 4 stars. As some views have said, birds, stars, etc. are missing here and there. A couple of examples I can think of off the top of my head are The Empress, whose crown only has 11 stars when there should be 12. Many believe that the stars are associated with the 12 astrological signs, so for there to be only 11 is a problem.<br />The King of Swords is another one with an issue. He's missing the birds in the background. As the King of the suit of air, this is a pretty significant detail. You can still read the cards as they are, and I suppose that kind of thing only bothers nitpickers such as myself. Honestly, I might not have even noticed these things had I not already been tipped off by other reviewers!<br /><br />Those who said that the backs NOT reversible are correct. They look symmetrical at a glance but they are not. It's such a minute difference that believe it was actually an error. I have a good eye but again, I probably would not have noticed this for a very long time (if at all) had I not read about it first. The difference, if you're wondering, can be seen mostly in the corners. The stars there aren't exactly the same size or in the same placement. Luckily, it's a small enough problem that I'm able to ignore it for the most part.<br /><br />The cards themselves are super slick and shiny and they feel good in the hands. They shuffle quite well, though they are slippery. I wish that they'd used a different font for the card titles, but that's not a huge deal to me either. As you can see, I have a good few minor gripes about the cards, but nothing is awful enough to make me dislike them. All of these things combined only warrants one star being knocked off, which isn't that bad at all.<br /><br />The cards do smell funny out of the box. I don't know if any of you ever collected Garbage Pail Kid cards as a kid, but that's what the smell reminds me of! The smell has already faded drastically after a few days of use so I'm sure it will dissipate entirely in time.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you're looking for a colorful spin on a classic deck, I would suggest checking this out. This deck has really lit a fire in me and has given me a new appreciation for RWS decks that I didn't have before. The cards are pleasing to the eye, warm, and inviting without being the kind of cards that tend to be so bright and pretty that they glaze over things and sugarcoat the truth.<br /><br />I'm satisfied with the deck overall and I think you probably will be too!, and I suppose that kind of thing only bothers nitpickers such as myself.

1594746036|5.0|I read this book in just 3 days; I could not put it down! This is one of the most well written, well told, stories which I've read in many years. This book isn't just for young readers, but adults too (I'm 40 years old). Please take the time to give this book a try -- It has suspense, love, family values, and a sprinkling of the `peculiar'. I am greatly anticipating the next book.
B00F1BFNFA|5.0|There is no other show on television that plays with our emotions and moods as successfully as Downton Abbey. The classy story of the Grantham family and the parallel world of their servants will involve you, thrill you, make you cry, laugh, cringe, and repeatedly draw you back for more.<br /><br />Sure it's a wee bit soapy, and some scenes border on the melodramatic and the sentimental, but heck, who cares? That's the entire reason it succeeds; it's pure unadultered escapism entertainment. Well that and Downton Abbey's superb cast, led by the impeccable [[ASIN:B008FWHK1C Hugh Bonneville]] and the great [[ASIN:B00170I7AW Elizabeth McGovern]], with the incomparable [[ASIN:B005UG542S Maggie Smith]] giving a fiery supporting lead, with Paul Giamatti, Brendan Coyle, and Michelle Dockery rounding out the talented main cast.<br /><br />Add to that excellent cinematography, rich costumes, beautiful sets and scenery, and authentic dialogue, and you have the makings of a fine show indeed. But when you add to THAT the brilliant human emotion, tangled relationships, colorful, sympathetic characters, wry humour, and a smart, fast-paced plot...you have the makings of near-perfection as only Masterpiece Theatre can make. This is Downton Abbey, and while it is not as epic as Game of Thrones, or as riveting as Breaking Bad or Person of Interest, Downton Abbey is like no other show on television. Your moods will rise and fall with the episodes and the fate of your favourite characters, be it Nurse O'Brien (who we all love to hate), or Edith Crawley (who we all hate to love) and every time you pop in the disc, you will be swept away for a wonderful evening of escapism to the lush mansion of Downton.<br /><br />Here's to much Downtonian delight in the future! 4.5 Stars!
B002413TY2|4.0|I love Jason Statham. He's a better version of Stallone and Willis. He is about as high energy as they get, kind of like Matt Damon in the Bourne movies.<br /><br />But, the Transporter series is getting a little old. They really are almost the same story just different faces. I know the concept of the  Transporter movies are similar, but I think after three it's time to move on.<br /><br />BTW, Safe is my favorite Statham movie to date.

B00F0N7JUG|5.0|[[ASIN:B003Y1D7UC Guillermo del Toro]]'s Pacific Rim is 2 hours of pure, unadulterated, escapist, awesome FUN. You want plot? I'll give you plot: Giant robots. With buzz saws, swords, guns, and fists. Fighting giant monsters. With acid, horns, claws, and wings.<br /><br />And that is all the plot you need. Let the most fun, action-packed, thrilling, awesome, escapist action/science fiction blockbuster event of the year begin! Pacific Rim is a film that appeals to the 12-year-olds in all of us. The action takes place on a gigantic scale, huge, operatic, devastating, lots of bashing and punching, but here's the thing: it was refreshing to see a climactic fight scene that did NOT take place in a major city, in which huge skyscrapers are destroyed, with people running from men in spandex. There was a lot of city destruction, but compared to Man of Steel or Star Trek Into Darkness or The Avengers, Pacific Rim was refreshingly \\"light and airy.\\"<br /><br />Those were director Guillermo del Toro's words on the tone he was hoping to strike for the film, as opposed to the usual \\"super-brooding, super-dark, cynical summer movie.\\" Although the majority of the film takes place in the dark and the rain, I believe he succeeded.<br /><br />But let me tell you this: I have never been more involved in a movie than when I watched Pacific Rim in the cinema. I was cheering during the fight scenes and literally gripping the sides of my chair in some parts. The characters were real and sympathetic, and even the Jaegers become relatable characters. This is in no small part to the acting, which was all round excellent and, at times, surprisingly subtle.<br /><br />Raleigh Becket is played with charisma [[ASIN:B0099JL0CA Charlie Hunnam]], and [[ASIN:B000NMW6M0 Rinko Kikuchi]] turns in a surprisingly excellent performance as Mako Mori, Raleigh's drifting partner. [[ASIN:B006GLQ092 Idris Elba]] is never bad, and although his character tends to be a bit dour, he is also really cool and brings a real presence to the film (And who can forget his line, \\"Today...we are cancelling the APOCALYPSE!\\" Oh yeah, By punching it in the face!). Charlie Day brings the levity and the comic relief, and both are entertaining as the as eccentric scientist Newton Gieszler. Del Toro's good luck charm is here too; the ever reliable Ron Perlman, who chews the scenery with his usual wacky gusto. Max Martini gives a surprisingly awesome role as Hercules Hanson, one of the veteran Jaeger pilots in the Pan Pacific Defense Corps.<br /><br />The human characters have realistic drama and conflict, and their actions and emotions are real to the audience...blah blah BLAH. Of course; we all know that. Del Toro is a veteran director, adept at world-building, immersive atmosphere, memorable characters, sincere emotion, and utter terror. But that's not what you came for, is it? We came for giant robots versus giant monsters. And on that front...Pacific Rim delivers!<br /><br />The action, is, in a word, completely AWESOME.  I say that in the literal sense. The Hong Kong fight will blow your friggin' mind. I was literally cheering at the screen. When you read it from a secondhand perspective, it may sound clich&eacute;d or even juvenile, but that moment where Crimson Typhoon (China) comes out with its 4 buzz saws, and Cherno Alpha (Russia) starts punching kaiju face...it's enough to make you feel 12 years-old again. It's the most incredibly thrilling and viscerally awesome scene in a movie I have seen in a long, long time. And I see a lot of movies. I could have given Pacific Rim 5 stars for that scene alone.<br /><br />But let's talk cons. This is definitely a more of a guy's movie. Nearly every female in the audience I watched it with described it as \\"Crazy\\", or halfheartedly called it \\"Good...\\" or, \\"Not my type of movie\\". There are a quite a few plot holes, and I feel that the climax was not handled as well as it should have (could have). There was a curious lack of emotion, and let me just say that it was slightly underwhelming for me.<br /><br />But that is not to detract from this otherwise excellent film. Technically, Guillermo strikes home. The CGI is amazing, and the use of 3D adds rather than detracts from the film. The score by Ramin Djawadi is stirring and catchy and completely awesome; becoming my new  FAVOURITE 2013 SCORE, taking 1st prize over Hans Zimmer's more operatic  Man of Steel score. The editing is very good; no shaky cam here. The camera work is filled with Del Toro's typically beautiful, stylistic flourishes and striking imagery.  The production design feels lived in, worn in, and is realistic without taking all the fun out of the entertaining sci-fi world Pacific Rim takes place in.<br /><br />...<br /><br />I'm running out of things to say here. Just go watch Pacific Rim, preferably at the biggest screen possible, in 3D (excellent use of it, I must say), and with the volume blaring. It's that rare thing in Hollywood nowadays: the completely original blockbuster. And as such, we must hail Guillermo del Toro as one of the great cinematic visions of our time. This is a subject of passion to him, and he directs with passion and with fervour. And the audiences, well, they're just swept along for the ride of a lifetime!<br /><br />Just go watch Pacific Rim! My rating? Level five kaiju out of five.<br /><br />P.S.

B00EU9BSNU|4.0|I've been a fan of Formula One motor racing for over twenty years; my grandfather, who was also a big fan, introduced me to it in the late 1980s, and since then I've followed every season, cheering on a succession of great British drivers - Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill, Jenson Button - and getting caught up in the intrigue, drama, excitement, adrenaline and masterful engineering each new season brings. It takes a certain kind of personality to hurtle down a straight towards a blind hairpin bend at 200mph with a machine as powerful as an F1 car under your right foot - the very next corner could, literally, be their last - and so the drivers who do this for a living tend to be larger-than-life themselves, prone to a certain sense of eccentricity and egotism. When I first started watching the sport, the biggest rivalry was between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, but a decade previously the two dominant personalities were the flamboyant and brilliant Englishman James Hunt, and the equally mercurial but slightly taciturn Austrian Niki Lauda.<br /><br />James Hunt was a color commentator on the BBC alongside the legendary Murray Walker by the time I first came to the sport, so I never actually got to see Hunt or Lauda in action, but I know their life stories well. Ron Howard's film Rush charts their relationship, both personal and professional, and is centered specifically on the 1976 season. Lauda, driving for Ferrari, was the reigning world champion, but the young and cocky Hunt - recently signed for the McLaren team, and in a competitive car for the first time - was posing a serious threat to Lauda's crown, and the rivalry between the two intensified as the season unfolded. Everything came to a head at the daunting Nürburgring circuit in Germany that August when an incident that has since gone down in F1 history changed everything, for both men. The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Hunt, Daniel Brühl as Lauda, and Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer in supporting roles, and hasa score by the ever-busy Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />Zimmer and Howard first worked together on Backdraft in 1991, but the German has been the director's exclusive composer-of-choice since The Da Vinci Code in 2006, and they have subsequently made four more films together, including this one. Interestingly, the score which Rush resembles the most is not one which Zimmer wrote for Howard, but is in fact from much further back in his filmography: the 1990 Tom Cruise NASCAR drama Days of Thunder. Rush is, basically, a rock score, featuring a small orchestra with strings and brass, but a large percussion section, and features solos for electric guitars, acoustic guitars, a drum kit, and lots of synthesizers. It doesn't have the rousing early `90s power anthem that Days of Thunder had, but it certainly has a great deal of its living-on-the-edge intensity, and its brash, confident attitude.<br /><br />The main theme, first heard in \\"1976\\", is a beauty. After a few moments of atmospheric build-up, with lonely piano chords and rumbling sustains overlaid with the occasional sampled whine of a passing race car, Martin Tillman's haunting electric cello theme emerges. Although it has a few superficial similarities to Ramin Djawadi's Lannister theme from his Game of Thrones TV scores (a case of the master influencing the apprentice, or vice versa?), its second performance by a full brass section overlaid with the rock-and-roll style guitars and synthetic sound design elements introduces the core idea of the score: that these guys were hard-drinking, hard-living, hard-partying rock stars of the sporting world (or, at least, James Hunt was), and the music follows them.<br /><br />As the score progresses, the theme disappears for long periods of time, and is replaced instead by what are effectively a series of well-written and well-composed rock instrumentals. \\"I Could Show You If You'd Like\\" showcases the swaggering attitude of Bryce Jacobs's electric guitar, and adds a rousing stringsection when it explodes further into the aggressive, throbbing \\"Into the Red\\", Zimmer's musical depiction of taking an 18,000 RPM vehicle to its limits. This style re-occurs in subsequent racing cues like \\"Watkins Glen\\" and \\"For Love\\" to excellent effect, although \\"20%\\" is grittier and dirtier, with an almost blues beat through the introduction of a Jerry Lee Lewis style piano element.<br /><br />The rock stylistics continue as the score develops, and listening to cues such as \\"Budgie\\", \\"Scuderia\\" and \\"Oysters in the Pits\\", with their tick-tock percussion and bass-heavy, melodic guitar riffs, I can't help but wonder whether Zimmer was inspired by Fleetwood Mac's seminal hit \\"The Chain\\", the instrumental solo part of which was used by the BBC as the theme music for their coverage of Formula 1 for years and years - if so, then I applaud his choices.<br /><br />Things change in the two pivotal cues, \\"Nürburgring\\" and \\"Inferno\\", which underscore the scenes leading up to and following Lauda's terrible crash on the Nordschleife. Zimmer uses stark synth sustains to add a level of tension and uneasy anticipation to the opening sequence of the cue, and dips into his exciting Dark Knight bag of tricks for the action-packed race sequence, before everything goes all dark as Lauda's life is forever changed in a fiery instant, a cue full of overwhelmingly dissonant synth chords, offset by faraway, tragic restatement of the main theme on electric cello - the first time we've heard it since the opening cue.<br /><br />From there on until the score's conclusion, the theme becomes much more prominent. It is performed in a slightly more subdued manner and accompanied by expectant synths and guitars in \\"Mount Fuji\\", and then takes a break while Zimmer revisits the Dark Knight action material for the energetic and entertaining \\"Reign\\", before returning to the theme for its most stirring renditions in the final two cues. The excellent \\"Lost But Won\\", the longest and most conventionally lyrical cue on the album, is the closest the score comes to showcasing a traditional Zimmer blockbuster theme, while the finale, \\"My Best Enemy\\", even works in a sampled choir to give the theme a boost of emotional resonance, and rounds out the score with a real sense of drama and a final roar of the engines racing to the checkered flag.<br /><br />To add to that 1970s flavor, the album also contains several period rock and pop songs, all of which are very good, especially \\"I Hear You Knocking\\" by Dave Edmunds, \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" by Steve Winwood, and the wonderfully clichéd \\"The Rocker\\" by Thin Lizzy.<br /><br />I liked the Rush score much more than I expected to, probably because I have associated this sort of music with Formula 1 since the 1990s and am used to it accompanying these sorts of scenes. It also helps that Zimmer's testosterone-fuelled compositions are fun and exciting, that the rock elements sound authentic and are well-performed, and that the main theme is really very beautiful. However, I can see how many listeners will find themselves put off entirely by the very thing that appeals to me here - the fact that it is a rock score. With the exception of the first and last two cues there are virtually no moments of real symphonic power, and anyone who needs the sound of a full orchestra in their scores will be disappointed when they realize that most of it is performed by electric guitars, synths and percussion. A cautious recommendation, for those who are absolutely sure they know what they are getting into.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of thrones was one of the best fantasy series of books I have read..and the first season of the serie was true to the book and very well filmed. Wondeful!!
B00B81B0HC|4.0|I am really enjoying the first half of the album with the various singles, but the second half is good as well. If my previous trends follow through, I'll probably end up loving the 2nd half of the album more than the first.
034580404X|5.0|I had told my boyfriend about them after reading my daughters set. He gad me order him a set and once his arrived...we read together...brought us even closer together having shared the journey of Christian and Ana.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|I wasn't all that familiar with the musical prior to seeing the movie with my wife, a huge fan of musical theater, and I can honestly say that this movie and soundtrack are on my list of favorites. The raw feeling that is conveyed in the movie is captured well in the soundtrack.
B00F35BV64|4.0|This version, like the previous was action packed and well done. I enjoyed the character portrayals and the special effects as well as the interesting changes to the original. I really liked how the movie was done and allowed myself to be immersed.<br /><br />I hope they continue making more with fervor. Being a child watching the original series, I still enjoy the overall concept of Star Trek. We really need movies like this that elaborate on the hope of a better future, and inspire our youth to obtain it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A lot love it, a lot hate it...<br />.<br />I am only saying that this book was able to keep my attention and was able to keep me reading it.  There is a lot I could comment on, from Orson Scott Card's real life political views ( which are terrible, Orson Scott Card is Peter, Orson Scott Card is a whack job full of hate ) to how a lot in this book relates to real life itself in the aspect of human behavior.<br />.<br />For a short story published in 1977, and a novel republished in 1985, the insight of the NET, AKA Internet, and the use of internetworked DESKS, AKA laptops, is one example that is so true to today's real life.  The Internet did not even exit in 1985, only the ARPANET existed, and its access in 1985 was very limited.  I mean you do not see books from the early 80's diving into the aspect of the NET in the manor in which it applies today.  Plus there is the aspect of what... population control.<br />.<br />The book also throws some random possible off shoots that leave you wondering as you are reading. Such as, \\"Is the bugger threat really real? Or is it just a ploy used by the I.F. as a way to maintain power and to keep the world focused on a common cause.\\"  That is raised.  Who is really the bad guy?  Are the bugger even real?  Are the bugger just a way of uniting Earth?  Is someone really playing a game or a deception?  Who is really PLAYING who?  It sometimes leaves you wondering what exactly is really going on.  You have that 1984 type government and that feeling of someone pulling the stings as the FATHER character in the film Equilibrium.  Plus, Peter is working on gaining power and destabilizing the various governments of Earth in the effort to take power.  It left me wonder if in the end, if Ender would be commanding I.F. ships and forces against his own brother to prevent his brother from seizing control of Earth.  There are some twists and turns in the book that leave one wondering and asking question... What is really going on?????<br />.<br />As for the use of children, that some readers dislike...<br />This book for sure touches on the dark side of all of us humans.  I believe that is why some people hate this book so much.  I mean children are gassed in Syria, today, right now! September, 2013. And no one, NO ONE, cares enough through out the world to take action. In part, people do not want to believe humans can really do that to other humans.  People wonder how Hitler came to power with the promise of hate and death and how no one cared or was willing to accept responsibility and the reality that Hitler was KILLING CHILDREN. No one in American cared until Pearl Harbor. Anyhow.<br />.<br />I can certainly say I was bullied in school by other kids, some I fought, and that I have had to contend with extremely unfair treatment by adults through my professional career.  Humans are very unfair, dishonest, immoral, unethical creatures who wake up each day and say, \\"Who can I cheat, or con, or ripoff, or blackmail, or take advantage of today?\\"<br />.<br />I know of no one who has not cheated on their taxes or who does not try regularly, to get away with something.<br />I will run a stop sign, call in sick, drive over the speed limit, tail gate other drives, cut in front of others, pay fast food workers minimum wage, outsource jobs so I can make more money... I need to make 20, not 15, million.<br />\\"How, or who do I cheat today so I am better off tomorrow?\\"<br />.<br />This book touches on that aspect, or dark side, of human nature.  Look at health care in America, it is one big profiteering ripoff game.  Pay up, or I let you die.  No one really cares about anyone, people just use people.<br />It is all so sad.  But it is very much real to life.<br />.<br />I am giving it a high rating.<br />.<br />Hopefully the film, Ender's Game, is as true to the book as possible.<br />.<br />I am appending comments I made about someone's review:<br />.####<br />Narrow-minded reviews:<br />Now the idea that six year old kids, like Ender, would get a crash combat course on the way to the front lines is a bit of a stretch. And when you factor in that Ender is not only supposed to fight when he arrives, that he's actually supposed to command an army, credulity reaches a snapping point. It's a six year journey, yes. But would Earth really appoint twelve year olds to plan and lead an invasion? Worse still, Ender Wiggins military training is essentially nothing more than laser tag in a zero-gravity chamber. And this training goes on and on, dominating nearly two thirds of the book. I, and other readers, just couldn't see how this was turning young Ender into the next George S. Patton.<br />.####<br />.<br />There are some issues with you analysis. Kids are NOT loaded onto a spaceship and shipped directly to the front lines. Their military training is NOT conducted in route.<br />.<br />They train in a military training school orbiting Earth, the BATTLE SCHOOL. Ender was NEVER on the front lines. The closest he got to the front lines was the Eros station, used as a ploy to trick Ender into thinking it was COMMAND SCHOOL. Eros was a previously held bugger station that was closest to Earth. It was further from the bugger home world and the front line, than anything other bugger facility or bugger station.<br />.<br />Earth DID NOT really appoint twelve year olds to plan and lead an invasion. Adults planned and controlled everything. Ender played games, using STRATEGY and TACTICS at the Eros COMMAND SCHOOL, that later turned out to be real battles on the front line. It kind of reminds you of the DRONES in Afghanistan controlled by DRONE operators in Texas. Open your mind.<br />.<br />If you think about, yes think, most likely the ship crews and fighting men and women on the front lines never even knew they were receiving orders from a KID.  The ships left Earth,what, around 100 years earlier.  I am sure the ship crews and fighter pilots were lied to just as Ender was.  If they lied to Ender, they are going to lie the soldiers on the Front Lines.  Front Line Crews took commands and fulfilled and followed their ORDERs without even knowing who was commanding them in battle.  I am sure that for all they knew Ender was a Patton, a full fledged fully grown adult highly trained tactical battle strategist.<br />.<br />HEY WAKE UP... SPACE is zero-gravity. Ships is zero-gravity are the equivalent of Ender playing laser tag in a zero-gravity chamber. Are you too narrow minded that you cannot make the connection. Each child in the laser tag in a zero-gravity chamber was the equivalent or representation of a ship in zero-gravity outer space. Wake up. I picked up on that when I read about them first entering the zero-gravity chamber with Alai and Ender learning to use their flash guns. Each kid was a ship.<br />.<br />You say you are not narrow minded, but you are.<br />.<br />George S. Patton was a tactical and small theater strategist. That is what Ender was. That is also why George S. Patton never got promoted to the big league of large theater wide command. That is who Ender was. Ender commanded small fleets at the COMMAND SCHOOL. The big wig, adult commanders, ran the theater wide command strategy for the push into bugger territory, not Ender. The big wig, adult commanders, deployed the fleets and commanded the over all picture.  Ender only jumped in, via the ansible ( Philotic Parallax Instantaneous Communicator ) to command or conduct the battles.<br />.<br />THINK. OPEN your mind. How are real wars fought? Who was General Marshall? Who was General Eisenhower? Who was General Bradley? Who was General Patton? What ROLLs did each play? What roll did Ender PLAY? THINK !!! Ender could be compared to Patton. But look at all of those who were above Patton. Think.<br />.<br />Actually read this book and THINK, yes think, think of how it truly relates to real life, to what is going on right now, with the Internet, DRONES in Afghanistan and Yemen, chemical weaponattacks against 400+ children in Syria.  Think!!!<br />.<br />The DRONE operators of tomorrow just might be twelve year olds...  WOW...<br />.<br />If a nation can GAS hundreds of kids to execute them, a nation can use them as DRONE operators to win a war.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Written like an anthropologist in the field, this by turns hilarious and poignant book was a read that I could barely put down. I picked it up after watching Orange is the New Black in its entirety on Netflix, and while it lacks the outrageousness that makes it a great series, the book is wonderful in a more subtle way.

It does a good job but i don't get the same quality picture as i would if viewing through my PS3 or Roku. Setup was super easy. would i recommend this device...yes and no. For $35 it's perfect. But chances are you probably own a XBOX or PS3 and they have netflix and youtube available on them, with better layouts. Netflix comes on everything already. Google Play is the only app that's not already out there other than on your computer.  So is Google play worth $35 to you? That's the question!

B00F35B8F8|5.0|This is a great escapist film with wide appeal. Unlike too many CGI intense films, human relationships drive a great story.  Written with intelligence and respect for the source material a talented cast delivers on every level.  You do not need to be a Trekkie to enjoy this great movie.  Visually stunning Star Trek Into Darkness never quits.

Solid performances by a talented cast including the wonderful Morgan Freedom and Michael Cain.  Now You See It presents some great illusions and a compelling story.  It's Hip, Fun and No it's not perfect but really enjoyable.  Strong direction, tight editing and great design gives the movie a slick polished appeal.
1573229725|4.0|On Goodreads, I'd put out a call for recommendations: \\"Your favourite novels set in mental asylums. Particularly those with electroshock, lobotomies, and other extreme therapies, but I'm up for whatever.\\" With this in mind, and also knowing of my enthusiasm for Gothics, Lila Veen recommended Sarah Waters' FINGERSMITH. And here we are.<br /><br />Hard to talk about this book without spoilers, so let's be deliberately vague. Indeed, the spoilers are the most fascinating parts of the story, so you'll have to trust me on this. I came in expecting a Gothic historical with an asylum. I got that and more!<br /><br />Deception, betrayal, family secrets, villainy (the villain even calls it that), Gothic, asylum, and Mr. Lilly's business - they combine for a cracker of a read. I jolly well recommend it for those interested in any of the above mentioned elements. Enjoy!

B000JIHP88|5.0|I love this mobile.  It is actually a discontinued item so I was happy to see it here on Amazon.  My first child absolutely loved this mobile.  He would wake up in the middle of the night and turn it on himself.  That was of course when he was a bit older.  As a baby though he also enjoyed it.  He would sleep very well.  Some reviews say how quiet it is but I find that very refreshing.  I don't want a mobile blaring in my babies face or ear when he is trying to sleep.  I purchased this again for our newest edition.  My kids will be 5 years apart so I am hoping this baby loves it just as much as the first.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The beginning, especially, was slow, but over time the movie got better. It was very different than what I expected. The God(s)-element made the movie interesting. There were a few really good laughs as well, which was surprising. Overall, the movie was moving and intense, and definitely warrants a second viewing to fully grasp what happened. Enjoy.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Wow, I was excited to see that my Chromecast arrived this morning when the mail came. I was eager to open it up and plug it into my TV and view my Ipad via my TV..  Until.....I found that it is very limited to specific programs and not what is on my screen. I was hoping that it would show whatever I had on my screen so I can do demos of whatever I wanted. Instead I am limited to Youtube and Netflix only... Not very useful in my mind. I am not interested in showing Youtube or Netflix to my employees. I needed to show them what I need to show them and how I want to show them.. Very frustrating.. So no, I cannot recommend this product.  On a positive note.. It does work well for Youtube and Netflix viewing.  I am hoping for an update that will allow me to view my screen on the TV.  I give it a big GRRRRRRRRRRRR Very disapointed....[[ASIN:B00DR0PDNE Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player]]
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This low key version of Austen's last completed novel captures the social and emotional tensions of the relationships among the major characters. Money, social position and time conspire to separate Anne Elliott and Captain Wentworth, and it is most delightful to see the story unfold, allowing  them, after an eight-year separation, to end up together.<br /><br />The scenes set in an autumnal countryside, plus the period the music helped build mood and atmosphere. A very worthy adaptation of the novel.

140006922X|2.0|Some questions and thoughts about the Zealot<br /><br />The book the Zealot Suffers several shortcomings<br />The First is that like most modern scholars raised in the west- and this includes me- he has no respect for authority. We like to challenge authority.<br /><br />This book does not revise or challenge critical Biblical investigation, but seeks to add to it, as the footnotes reveal. But it does seek to challenge existing popular Christian understandings of the Bible and of Jesus<br /><br />In the West, scholarship is rewarded for novelty, creativity, and  newness , not for agreeing with existing ideas. The result is a heavy bias against an established approach and understanding.  And that is the case whether it be that Shakespeare did not write the plays normally attributed to him or that all the synoptics were written after 70 AD, etc,. Novelty is what gets you published. But the internal difficulties of the synoptic gospels, as well as the lack of agreement with the gospel of John  has been known and studied since the earliest days of Christianity. Additionally, the supposed split between Paul and Peter has also been written for hundreds of years The librarians in Alexander had developed sophisticated methods for analyzing written materials  and  shared their techniques. Ancient Biblical scholars were scholars and knew the problems of the texts better than we and yet did not edit the problems out of the texts. The redactors of the texts could easily have constructed an homogenized life of Jesus, but they believed they were working with inspired documents and left the problems in.<br />.  It is certainly true that sometimes an archeological find may occur, and this kind of data has and must receive careful scrutiny. The dead sea scrolls are an example of this. They have been studied at great length and have  been used to improve our translation of the Hebrew Scriptures.,<br /><br />All dates are a guess that do not stand up well to critical thinking<br /><br/> Aslan has no problem accepting late dates for the synoptics and John.  The reality is that no one knows when the gospels were written. All supposed dates come from analyzing the gospels themselves, and that analysis often  takes place with an anti religious bias.<br /><br />Look, for example, at the gospel of Luke. All critics agree that it is part of a double scroll, which is Luke-Acts.<br /><br />And where does Acts end? With Paul in prison in Rome. The  most reasonable explanation for this is that that is all the information that Luke had. If any reasonable person were writing a history,  and Luke certainly seems reasonable, were writing after 70 CE reference would be made to the destruction of the temple in 70 AD . None of the Gospels do this. The Jews wrote extensively about the destruction of the first temple and the resulting 70 years captivity in Babylon. The Jewish tradition demands that God's activity be seen even in the darkest events of their history.  It is out of this tradition that the New testament came to be. Why, if the writers of the N.T. ,certainly Paul, see Jesus and the church as the fulfillment of Jewish messianic hopes, did they not tell of the destruction of the temple? To fool readers into thinking that they were written before 70 CE? That doesn't make sense at all<br /><br />It is argued that the predictions of Jesus about the temple are so specific that they demand a late date. A close reading reveals that this is not the case. Jesus knew of the destruction of Sepphoris and of other Roman atrocities. The prediction of Jesus fall in the range of an aware person of the first century.  The writers of the gospels were aware of how Rome treated Sepphoris . It did not take supernatural insight to realize that Rome would burn the temple in Jerusalem to the ground and destroy it completely.<br /><br />The dates for most of Paul's writings are know from agreement with archeological evidence and are not contested, although the order is.<br /><br />A swing through Wikipedia, will give you some idea of the variety of viewpoints with respect to dates. Agreement we do not have.<br /><br />The scholars who selected and canonized the scriptures were closer to the authors than any of us. Furthermore, they knew the cultures from which those documents came.  They  were well aware of the obvious difficulties of reconciling the writings and reconciling differences.<br /><br />While the conjectures may be right in some cases, none of the speculations would stand up in a court  of law.  A good defense attorney could tear them all apart.<br /><br />All of this in nowise implies that scripture should not be subjected to scrutiny. It does the Christian no good to label the scriptures as infallible or inerrant. To do so isolates the Christian from academia and from our culture that needs to reach with its message.<br /><br />The author claims to be a Muslim, yet he ignores the teachings of Jesus found in the Quran. The Quran teaches that Jesus was virgin born, a miracle worker, spoke from the cradle and was a true prophet of God but somehow his message was messed up by his followers. Consequently God gave us Muhammad to get the true message out to mankind. How can this author claim to be a follower of the prophet and submit to the Qurans authority when he treats Jesus so un Quranicaly?
0679805273|3.0|The seller did not indicate that one of the cover pages contained a lengthy and very personal note of congratulations from the original  purchaser of this book to her gift recipient.  Unfortunately, for me, the purchaser's handwriting was very similar to mine and her name the same as mine, so I had a lot of &#34;splaining to do Lucy&#34; to ensure my husband that this was not a book that I had once given to an old flame.  Other than that, the book was clean and in very good condition.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A friend told me about this book a couple of times before I bought it. The story is so engaging that I read it over a weekend.
B00CFYD682|5.0|I have been a fan of Alison since the mid 1980s. Still love her. This CD was even better than expected. She still has it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great entretainment !!! It takes a while to read it but worthy, unfortunately my kindle had some problems, I had to return it.
B004HW7JMY|4.0|I was not expecting to like this season since it did not have Andy.  However, they did a really good job with the new characters. Liked seeing the development of the story and new characters.
0143122010|4.0|This is an important book. The author presents a thorough analysis of human violence throughout the existence of our species. He makes a convincing case that, despite common observations, we are actually becoming more peaceful. I won't go into all of Pinker's points since the text, including notes and index, is over 800 pages while the audiobook is nearly 37 hours. The author uses this time and space to provide documentation of his assertions in order to lend credibility to his counter-intuitive thesis, and these often involve tedious, but necessary, mathematical calculations,.<br /><br />I enjoyed most of this book and put up with the rest because it was good for me. I suspect some readers would actually like the sections that I merely endured. They really were necessary for this book to be taken seriously. Pinker provides a good overview of human history while describing a hopeful trend towards the predominance of those \\"better angels of our nature.\\" Reading or listening to this work requires a large commitment of time from the reader but, for me, it was worthwhile. I find myself watching the daily news with a different, more hopeful, perspective. However, readers seeking pure light entertainment should be forewarned that this book will probably not provide that.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I have to admit when I first saw the very first Sherlock episode I wondered how it would do. I have to admit that I am now completely addicted to it, Benedict Cumberbatch, portrays a modern Sherlock with a tendency to be cold and callus, Benedict is an amazing actor. If you've only seen him in Sherlock you should really watch the movies he has been in, such as War horse, Third Star, and others. Martin Freeman, everyone's favorite hobbit, plays John Watson. I know he played Watson before Bilbo, but he's had a great spike in popularity due to that role.<br /><br />If you don't want to watch it for the actors, then watch it for the story, this is every bit a Sherlock fan's must watch.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Works well for me, no complaints. I've tried others but always rely on Yahoo Mail for my main email service.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series, great story lines, great acting.  Be aware you might get addicted ! I could not stop watching it.
0345803507|5.0|This is the final book of a series of 3 books.  It is a very fun to read love story with some really strange twists.  It tells the story in a very interesting way.  It is both exciting and romantic story of 2 people that truly each other and manage to work thru their differences to accommodate one another.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I didn't use the download, I watched the Blu-ray. Extras were interesting. Robert Heinlein's story of apes being uplifted as servants and then declared sentient by the courts would probably have been more believable but it still makes for a decent story. Special effects were good.
B000I9VZKW|4.0|I liked this fantasy / science fiction adventure. It was enjoyable and fun to watch.<br />I also enjoyed the humor.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I ordered my new power cord expecting to wait a bit unable to use my kindle,<br />But delivery was so fast and cord is perfect.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked it however, I had a difficult time connecting the two main characters as anything but possibly developing a great relationship as friends.  It may have developed into a different ending
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A story with such a powerful message told in such an intimate setting that you are moved to tears and enraged in the next moment and then awed by the spirit of the female characters.  This book is every bit as compelling and engaging as The Help  and provides a much needed personal account of slave life on one plantation and the true meaning of family integrity and courage.
B00820N2JG|5.0|Such a funny movie. I have watched it about a million times. Great movie for having friends over!! &#34;I PROMISE&#34;

B0034DGPEU|5.0|Fantastic.  This was a book I could not put down.  All the characters created such emotion,s both positive and negative that I have recommended this book so all my other friends in book clubs.  A great book to read and to discuss
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|someone would be out of their mind to not give this game 5 stars!Am I right???can't. get enough if my minion rush
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|I love this movie, always have. Tom Hanks is just amazing. I could watch this movie everyday. Great story, great acting!
B001G70M6S|5.0|I bought both the FP-100 and 3000. Maybe I just like B&W more or maybe the 3000 iso isn't that bad. But the picture came out great. I loved the result and its a hell of a lot cheaper then SX-70 or 600 film and you get 2 more shots than the others. I used a Polaroid Land Camera 104 with a external flash for indoor use. I love it!
B007Y36K46|5.0|This is an extraordinary, and phenomenally entertaining movie.  Right in keeping with the creative genius of \\"Star Wars\\",  and \\"Avatar\\" or even \\"Ben Hur.\\"  I can hardly wait for the sequel which I hope Disney/Stanton will make.  Excellent acting and what a story to follow.  Interplanetary travel via a medallion powered by blue light and battling for your life and others.  How many of us have gazed up at the stars and thought if I could only go there now and see what life is like on that star, that speck of light up there?  Well, this movie takes you to Mars and you are transported right along with the hero, John Carter by chanting a few words of an ancient chant while touching that medallion and suddenly, incredibly, you are there!<br /><br />John Carter, a mere mortal on earth, a soldier, from the state of  Virginia,  becomes a superhuman being on Mars.  He can fly. He can fight hordes of creatures, horrible monsters, devious, scheming, villanous immortals,  and rescue a warrior princess and fall in love. War, and  peace unfold in thrilling action packed scenes.<br /><br />Clever plot, excellent insertion of writer Edgar Rice Burroughs as John Carter's nephew and delightful use of humor plus amazing electrifying  battle scenes.  This movie  should have been lauded and included in  Academy Award honors or Cannes Film Festival.  I don't know what the critics were thinking.  This is an awesome film.  Kudos  to Taylor Kitsch (John Carter)  and Lynn Collins ( the beautiful warrior princess) and to the entire cast and to Disney.  Come on and make \\"John Carter 2\\"<br /><br />Highly recommend.  Good adventure.  Good fun.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is for everyone.  It can be played where ever, when ever and is most relaxing.  My children and I have competitions with each other.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Could not put the book down. I had just finished Pillars of The Earth and knew that I wanted to immediately starts on World Without End.  Ken Follett just keeps getting better.
B00B3EVNEE|4.0|Robin continues to blow me away! Great blues renditions Trower style. Vocals are great. Classic album the minute it was released.
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Horrible writing, bad dialogue, stilted descriptions. Painful to read an entire book that seemed to have been written by a 4th grader (style, not content). Completely unbelievable plot twist, if you can call it that. This is the best detective in the land, and he never figured THAT out? Thiede had a good idea, but should have found someone with a bit of writing ability to put it into a book.
B005AKFXZW|2.0|After reading some rave reviews of this book I decided to give it a try, and was quite disappointed. The story was difficult to really get into, and I had to try about 5 times to really start to feel any desire to keep reading (which is quite rare for me). I felt like the characters weren't developed enough and felt a bit flat, so when the book finished I found I didn't really care what happened to them - I love books that I can't stop thinking about after I've finished, whether it's a light summer read or a series, and the only thing I thought at the end of this was I was glad it was finally over so I could start something else.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A great story that is truly thought provoking and FULL of suspense !!!! Wonderfu, smooth writing which makes this book fly by!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Came in brand new was just as described. It was bought as a gift for my mother and she just loved it. Very fast shipment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! I play it almost all the time and never get tired of it. a must download! I don't know what else to say except.... INSTALL IT RIGHT AWAY
B00908DDZM|5.0|I am happy with my cd. Great price and I received the it quickly. I plan on making more purchases in the future.
B00192IV0O|5.0|Great road trip music. Love the BEP's. Good selection of titles. It's a CD OK, it works as expected, one more word.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Reza Asian's Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth is a narrative history of the place and time that Jesus lived.  Because the Romans were comparatively good record keepers, his history is able to tell the story of the place with great certainty.<br /><br />Jesus emerges as a figure who is caught between his fellow Jews who cooperate with Rome to secure their power and the Roman outsiders.  He is a political figure who becomes the basis for a third way.<br /><br />For readers like me whose conception of Jesus is mythical and faith-based, his story makes the popular, superficial image of Jesus much more interesting.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|I love Joe and have most of his cds.  It is rare to find a cd with practically every song is hit, but most of the songs on this cd have great lyrics.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I liked the insight into the Jewish Religion. The politics of the time surprised me. I never realized how much Rome impacted that time in history
B001FB4VXU|5.0|the interaction between the characters, but we just especially like the Star Jim Parsons -- he's great == perfect for the part. His facial expressions are hysterically funny!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the movie first so wasn't sure the book could hold muster. The first book was so intriguing and like the movie. Enjoyed every moment of it. Wasn't sure how they could continue the story but it pulls you in. You care about the characters and the families. Especially how it will all end. A excellent story! I highly recommend it!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Great story and action.  Many subplots...keeps you hanging!  Even at the end, you are still guessing as to what is reality vs dream.
B00EEN7CAK|4.0|What makes this movie so fascinating is that it's true.  Five spoiled LA kids actually committed burglaries on the homes of rich and famous celebrities stealing designer clothing, jewelry, cash and drugs.  These weren't kids who were from poor families or who were stealing to fund a drug habit.  They were all from upper middle class households and the burglaries were more of a way to connect with the celebrities who were their idols.  With the money and items they stole, they were given access to a whole lifestyle, one that they envied and practically worshipped through the constant feed of social media and celebrity websites.  The group became celebrities themselves in their own social circles because they bragged about their accomplishments and showed off pictures of each other inside the star's private homes.  Eventually, someone turns the kids in and they are all arrested.  None, however, show real remorse for their actions.  A few of the girls ended up getting a reality television show for a while solely as a result of their popularity and being part of the burglar bunch.  This movie completely brings home the ridiculous nature of our country's obsession with celebrities and how that obsession affects young people.  The film has its funny moments as well as moments that are really sad.  The acting is all spot on.  Emma Watson is dead on as one of the ring leaders and Leslie Mann as the cluelessly pathetic mother of three of the girls involved is hilarious but still sympathetic.  Even the group members who ended up spending some minimal time in jail seem to have brushed it all off and continued their lives without ever realizing what has actually happened.  The feeling of entitlement that they all have is still driving them and they fully capitalize on their notoriety without ever stopping to realize that they've been convicted of a crime, a bad thing. Are we becoming a world obsessed with fame and celebrity?  The Bling Ring makes a strong case that we are, andwith websites like TMZ and radar online providing that constant drip of photos and info into our veins, it's actually pretty easy to agree.  Watch the Bling Ring.  If nothing else, it will make you laugh but it might also make you think .
B00E978FGQ|5.0|This movie was such a refreshing change from the usual serial killer, police, action, shoot 'em up type of movie thats so easy to predict. The plot is extremely well written, with VERY unexpected twists and turns. It is fun, unpredictable, intelligent, and well acted. I liked it because there's no violence or people getting shot or otherwise mutilated. But the end, wow. What an AMAZING movie! Anyone who's given it LESS than five stars has positively NO sense of adventure, and CAN'T think two steps ahead! I HIGHLY recommend this movie. I  never write reviews, but for THIS movie, I took the time because I hope it helps someone else.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|PIcked this up for a book club. Since I'd seen the movie I thought the book might be even better. But it turns out it's just the opposite: the quirky full of life characters played by DeNiro and Lawrence are in the book version flat characters. The narrative is so plain as to be flat out ridiculous, like an eight year old is telling the story.  Too much football altogether.  I don't get it. FSG? Movie deal? Whoever wrote the screenplay did this writer a huge favor because it elevated it to the tenth power.
B000W91RUG|5.0|pure enjoyment from start to finish. Great cast, but Jim Parsons is A+ all the way. His facial expressions are exquisite!
140006922X|5.0|As a deist I believe this debunks much of what the fundamentalist Christians hold to be true yet he shows historically that it can not be true.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This author has such command of his craft that I can't help but like this book. However, the ending felt incomplete, as though there were more to be said.
B000001GQP|5.0|I recently heard this recording on our public radio station and immediately noticed that it stood out from other versions that I had heard. I bought the cd and was even more impressed so I bought three more for some friends. When I tried to figure out why it was special it dawned on me that everything was special.
B00ET0PZDO|3.0|Fun and not so difficult as some. Graphics are decent and objects are easily recognizeable. Recommend to anyone who likes &quot;open the door&quot; games
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is fantastic! I've been using every night to clear my mind of my busy day. I'm asleep in 15 minutes. It's also a plus that the app turns off after the timer expires.
B00AOQ8MOQ|5.0|I have probably watched this movie 10 times in my life and I love it! The story is exciting the whole way through, the characters are awesome and the action is heart pounding. A definite must see!
B00B97TMIE|1.0|Only 3 songs that I like, the rest is crap to me.  Unless you like lots of noise then you'll like this
B0091REZMW|5.0|Lots of fun! Love hidden objects games! Just started and cant wait to get a little farther into the game!
1416583432|5.0|This book opened the reality of what one may have never thought in regards of their K-9.  The thinking from a persons view by evaluating the dogs movements emotions toward the human is just on target.  As I read the book, I was thinking about sections. YEAH, that's what they are probably thinking.<br /><br />Also what I like about this book is that there are small sections within a chapter you can read easily in a short period of time.  You don't have to read the entire chapter and try to remember where you left off in the train of thought.<br /><br />A book that I definitely won't donate, rather I will re-read it or share it with my other dog owner friends.
0385736002|2.0|I really wanted to love this book. It has some of my favorite things: magic and mythology. But there was just too much going on for me I think. Scott melded mythologies and legends from almost every culture and it's a bit disorienting. Gods from cultures all across the spectrum pop up: we've got Bastet from Egypt, the Morrigan of Celtic fame, and Hekate from Greco-Roman mythology. Immortals are infamous historical figures like Flamel and his wife (no surprise there) and the villain Dr. John Dee.<br /><br />The disorientation trend continued with rapid shifts in point of view: from Sophie, to Josh, to Flamel, to Perenelle, to Dee. Took me awhile to get through it because I kept having to set it aside and was somewhat reluctant to pick it up again.<br /><br />Sophie and Josh started off interesting, but quickly grew predictable and somewhat flat to me. They stopped resonating with me and the story became plot-driven as opposed to character-driven.<br /><br />That said, the plot is definitely interesting with some unexpected twists and turns and I enjoyed parts of it. I'm just not sure yet if it's enough to keep me reading the series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|An easy and very useful app for keeping track of time.  We use it mostly for the alarm but also on the timer which is effective without being too annoying!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Streaming from my android device is a breeze and the quality of the video is pretty good. The setup is relatively easy and takes only a little time. I think google scored on this one.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|The game has nice animation, and is visually enjoyable. Game play is very engaging... not to simple yet not to complex.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Once again, I'm left to wonder what happen to his \\"murderous\\" son.  However, I rather enjoyed the novel, and rated all three as must reads.
0547569653|5.0|I never thought I'd be a person who would like books about running, but here I am.  Born to Run made me try minimalist-shoe running (total convert), and Eat&Run has done the same regarding nutrition.  I'm not planning to go vegan, but I was so psyched by the idea that you really can get excellent nutrition without eating meat.  Then on top of that, you get this look at what it takes to be an ultra marathoner at the top level.  He seems to be both a regular guy, and yet clearly also obsessive.  His story is so interesting and very well told.  This book has appeal for any age group.  I bought it in hardback because I could tell this was one I'll want to reference for year to come - either for the recipes or the running tips.  What a great guy you are, Mr Jurek!
1250030951|4.0|I didn't love Fangirl like I expected to.<br /><br />My expectations are somewhat obvious. I identify with the title. I frequently call myself a fangirl. And a main character who writes fanfiction? Having spent the ages of 13-19 immersed in fanfiction, and still dabbling in it to this day, I anticipated an easy connection with Cath.<br /><br />And Cath and I had a lot of things in common! Besides the fanfiction angle, we both majored in Creative Writing, are somewhat bad about dealing with strangers (particularly of the male variety), and went to college knowing about one other person. For Cath, it's her twin sister, and for me it was my best friend, whom I've known since the age of 11.<br /><br />Maybe the fact that Cath and I had so much in common is why I couldn't connect with her. Was I maybe trying too much to have a character make the decisions I would make?<br /><br />I do think that's part of it, particularly as it pertained to her schoolwork. I found myself wanting to scream at her over and over again. And it made me angry how, although she professes an degree of insecurity, it often felt to me like she shamed those who wanted to have the typical college experience or dealt with things in ways different from her.<br /><br />And the fandom aspect didn't come through for me. I understood that Cath spent a lot of time and effort on her Simon Snow work, but where was the joy in it? It's so wrapped up in her identity, but FEELINGS have always been what's driven me to participate in fandom and I didn't feel Cath's feels for Simon Snow but one or two times. I also found the long excerpts of her `fics and the Simon Snow novels distracting from Cath's personal journey. Not to mention that I was distracted trying to draw the obvious parallels between Simon Snow and Harry Potter.<br /><br />Rainbow Rowell does, however capture those feelings of social ineptitude while trying to navigate life on your own very well. I was drawn easily back to my freshman year, remembering how I felt like clutching my textbooks to my chest constantly, as though they could protect me from my teacher's judgements or my own missteps.<br /><br />Cath's changing relationship with her twin sister was also fascinating- like a rubber band, they stretched apart, but sprang back together. I also enjoyed Levi, but sort of \\"sided\\" with him during a conflict between him and Cath.<br /><br />The brightest of bright spots in Fangirl was, for me, Cath's prickly roommate Reagan. I adored Reagan, with her badassery and firm self-identity. I loved how she forcibly pulled Cath from her shell in her own dry way, snarky and wonderful.<br /><br />Despite my many issues with it, I did really enjoy Fangirl, and rated it 4 stars. I think for people curious about fandom, it might be a good introduction to the culture, and it was nice to enjoy a college setting for a change.<br /><br />- See more at: [...]
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|Looks exactly as pictured.  Easy to install once you find the ridge along the front that secures the two pieces together.  Works well with the iMagnet mount as the metal disc fits between the two parts of the case and doesn't touch the phone.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I like it because it came with the angry bird tunes.  You can play or watch funny episodes.  It does not include the green bird which is good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is well-written and definitely a page turner. It's very hard to put down and a somewhat enjoyable read in that any page turner is an enjoyable way to spend your time. The story is presented from two points of view, and the chapters alternate from Nick's story (the husband) to Amy's (the wife) and back again. The problem is, when I read a novel for pleasure, I want there to be at least one character I can root for, or at least hope for. In this book, the characters may toss that role back and forth, but in the end, I found myself rooting for no one, disliking both of them, and basically reading to find out how it ends so I could never know the characters ever again. As I said, very engrossing, very good writing. Just sort of unpleasant with a bad aftertaste.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The story was beautifully told and it made you feel as if you had been part of the story.  Well done, I would recommend this book w/o hesitation.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed the movie.  Great story with a great ending.  The story did seem to slow down a lot towards the mddle end, but nothing that makes me regret watching.  Stick with it, you'll be rewarded in the end.
1423136802|4.0|Note: This review is of the set itself, not the content of the books. A synopsis of each of the books is readily-available, and I don't like to post spoilers.<br /><br />I got this set for my 12-year-old daughter and she loves it. I ordered the paperback version, and everything arrived as advertised. The books included are: The Lightning Thief (400 pages), The Sea of Monsters (304 pages), The Titan's Curse (336 pages), The Battle of the Labyrinth (384 pages), and The Last Olympian (416 pages). They come in a simple decorated cardboard box (click on the Paperback option to see this) which is adequate for this. The \\"treasure chest\\" box comes with the hardcover set. These aren't comic books or graphic novels; they're full-fledged books.<br /><br />If your child (or yourself) is into anime, manga, or fantasy novels, this is a great starter set. Buying the five books by themselves will run you about $31, so paying $21 for the whole set and a decorated box is a good deal.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Very cool!you can download all the YouTube videos that you want. The only thing that i would like is that it would of been much better if you could get out of Tube Mate and not having to stay there until the whole download is over other than that great :)
B004UPANAI|4.0|Our family enjoyed the film but one younger member got a little bored.  The action scenes are good but the balance between comic book and action film doesn't quite work perfectly here.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|Do not waste your money renting this pathetic excuse for a movie. My husband loves special effects and CGI, so even though rottentomatoes.com rates this movie poorly, we rented it. Big mistake. The acting is wooden. The script is contrived. The direction is nightmarish. The story plods along as if it's moving through a thick fog. I fell asleep a couple of times and finally quit watching halfway through. My husband watched the second half of the movie the next night, hoping it would get better (hello?), and I could tell from the next room, just listening to bits and pieces of the dialogue, that it only got worse. He agreed. Seriously. This movie is one of the worst I've seen in a long, long time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read nearly every post apocalyptic sci fi book on here and this may be the best.  Great backstory but very much character driven. Not cliche or cheesy just generally awesome can't wait to read the next two collections! I want to shake the authors hand way to fecking go!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I think every author, when pushed by economics to push out a book or two a year, starts to lose that magic they used to write their first few books, when they had the time to come up with fresh new ideas.  This book was a good, easy read, but nothing spectacular or particularly riveting.  I enjoy the character, though, so I read on.  Four stars.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|From the start, this book holds your interest and keeps your mind involved and trying to figure out who the bad guys are.  The ending is not completely a surprise but leaves some doubt as to who the guilty is going to be.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|This latest Grisham novel seems to follow the formula of 'The Firm' very closely:  A trusting and somewhat naive small-town lawyer is duped into serving as an unwitting conspirator in a money laundering scheme and sent to federal prison by an unscrupulous corrupt judge.  This judge, recently slain at his cabin, had a safe stuffed with gold ingots. There, at a low security prison camp, Mal the protagonist, meets s kindred spirit and cooks up a plot for each of them to be released from prison under Rule 35, i.e., helping law enforcement solve a different crime. His new prison pal has a sister to whom Mal,  takes a liking, and she in cahoots with the other two, becomes a major player in the scheme.  They are successful in outwitting the FBI, getting the money, and lease a yacht and head off to the Caribbean to bask in the sun until the cows come home (or the money runs out, which will be never).<br /><br />The biggest problem I have had with Grisham's last several books and this one included is that it sounds like a newspaper article or a report, or a shopping list. the sentences are very static and matter-of-fact: I did that, she did this, then we went there, etc. Perhaps it's been his style since the beginning, but if so, I never noticed in the early novels, and I've read every single novel he's written, well, except the Christmas one.<br /><br />I'll give him a huge amount of brownie points for knowing that the past tense of 'sneak' is 'sneaked' and not 'snuck'.  I got a ruler over the knuckles in school for making that mistake, a few times, and so I never forget it, even if 'snuck' once not even considered a word, is now making its way into dictionaries, mostly American, for now, but others are catching up, and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes common usage.  It's a pet peeve of mine and it was almost a relief to see it in print again - a small thing...but I noticed it.  He also knows the difference in applying 'lie' 'lay' 'laid' and 'lain'-  again refreshing to see - and it shouldn't be.  Just had to get that said.<br /><br />Although the plot was heavily formulaic, I found the details of this version just interesting enough to hold my attention, and I enjoyed it, mostly, but with skills of his caliber, it would be wonderful if he would sit down and write from the heart, something he believed in and was deeply proud of, something that would grip and rivet the imagination, stir up and magnify the emotions and elevate the spirit and send it soaring.  He can do it, I'm certain of it, but these last several books seem written as if he didn't care, written almost grudgingly and perhaps even defiantly -perhaps to get his publishers off his back and to keep the pot boiling.<br /><br />Well, it is what it is, and his style is his own.  More of the same, but that's not such a bad thing.  I've liked it well enough to keep buying his books.o see - and it shouldn't be.

B0014DW3OS|5.0|Denzel at his best.  The man can act.  I wouldn't watch this with the kids, though...  It's worth a few bucks to rent and watch it again.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|its been a long time since i listened to it! it is a nice cd but not like the previous ones. it is ok for easy listening.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|World War Z is action packed. These zombies aren't your typical slow movers, they are lighting fast. One of the best movies of the year.
140006922X|4.0|Just a really good book for those who want to know a little more about<br />the life and times from Jesus, not a Biblical view.  Goes into<br />how the church really split, between Jesus brother, James, and<br />how Paul took it upon himself to invent what he thought Christianity<br />should be like. Very well documented.  I throughly enjoyed reading this book.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|lots of fun playing this game.  gets really annoying having to scratch cards for coins to play.  particularly when my coins get lost when the game freezes blaming connection.  my connection is fine.  i also hate how you have to be on facebook to play friends.

0399159347|2.0|Now that I'm a husband, I am going to keep the fact that I read this book a secret. Quick read but unlikable characters galore, predictable coincidences, thin ending. Best part of this book was the tight and creative epilogue. I read high praises about this book in Entertainment Weekly but thankfully opted for my local library. I have 'What Alice Forgot' on my Kindle but now am rethinking reading that, too...

0525478817|5.0|I'm developing a terrible habit of only wanting to review books I find exceptional, which really defeats the purpose of writing book reviews.    John Green's The Fault In Our Stars definitely falls into the \\"exceptional\\" category. In fact, it's probably my new favorite book. A Tale of Two Cities has been my favorite book since I first picked it up four years ago in my tenth grade English class. For me, it's difficult to find a book that even comes close to Dickens' classic, but this book has done the impossible and dethroned A Tale of Two Cities.    Granted, the two books fall in very separate categories. If you aren't familiar with the story of ATOTC, I highly encourage you to pick it up, but this review will only focus on Green's novel.    To give a quick summary, the story focuses on Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old girl battling terminal cancer. She forms a friendship and begins to fall in love with a fellow cancer survivor: Augustus Waters. The book follows their beautiful story as they bond over Peter Van Houten's An Imperial Affliction and struggle with a question that everyone can relate to: When I die, will I be remembered?    John Green is an absolutely brilliant writer. I'm familiar with Green from his famous YouTube videos, which made reading this book even more fun. I shouldn't be surprised I enjoyed this book so much - it spent seven consecutive weeks in the #1 spot of The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Books (though it should be noted that I definitely would not call this a \\"children's book\\"). The work is full of witty banter between the two main characters as well as touching moments that avoid being too cheesy. Green does an amazing job of creating characters that seem real. He doesn't paint a rosy picture of two heroic cancer survivors. He shows the characters at both their best and their worst, making them relatable to readers.    More impressively, I can honestly say there is not a dull moment in this book. I tend to puta book down at a dull point and pick it up later on so I don't get too bored. That was not necessary with this book. I read the whole thing in less than 24 hours. I laughed. I cried. And I wanted to throw this book at a wall. But I think those are emotions every reader feels when reading a truly great novel.    When I closed this book last night and tried to cope with the intense melancholy that was consuming me, I had a telling realization:    I felt like if I never had the chance to read a book again, I would be okay because I got to end with that one.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am obsessed with the movie so when i saw this game i had to get it. It's so fun and addicting!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was by far, full of pleasant surprises and wonderful displays of tremendous, unexpected magic illusions.  I played the movie twice and now I wish I had purchased it.  I just might do that anyway.  And again - the ending was the biggest and best surprise of all.  I don't want to give any spoiler alerts because then it would really ruin ALL the surprises that keep coming.  And best yet - NO filthy swearing - NO filthy sex scenes - just a great script  with great actors and perfect for the entire Family to enjoy together.<br /><br />DramaNana

0061950726|5.0|This book is an easy read with a fast paced story line and interesting characters. If you like historical fiction about immigration in the 1920-30's this may be the book for you.

B008469DGY|5.0|No matter what you're doing, if you're waiting for something this game is great for taking out and playing. I have played a solid hour or so and I feel as If im barely through the map selection. Every map looks and feels different, and with the difficulty scaling every map I feel challenged to make it to the next level. Very fun, I recommend this game

B00DU74U74|4.0|Both were decent. I enjoyed them. Good for a teenage. My son like it surprisingly. I would recommend watching it.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|Kinda pissed that this Blu-Ray 3D release does not include all the special features. I mean come on thought I was buying the complete thing here. The fact that more than 30min of special features and the COMMENTARIES are not included here is really stupid. Forcing consumers to buy 4 seperate versions of the same film just to get all the special features is just bad business practice. Will not be buying future releases especially from paramount until I check the reviews and confirm I am not being ripped off.
B00F35BV64|2.0|This new era \\"Star Trek\\" saga is lacking in quite of bit of Roddenberry's philosophy. Roddenberry's works were laden with a strong underlying sense of duty, integrity, honor, respect, and a smidgen  of nobleness. Into Darkness may slightly hint at those things (as a sprinkling afterthought) but basically it's two hours of hyped up special effects just for the sake of special effects flash, sparkle, and bang. I suspect that the younger generation, who quite simply cannot identify with the above mentioned philosophy, are drawn to this film for its video game like presentation, music (amazing how in the 23rd century hip-hop, rap, and house are still so popular), and screeching video game noises. I don't think that many of those who really get, and appreciate, Roddenberry's Star Trek vision will find much value in this one-legged sci-fi B movie.
B00DB31Y3U|3.0|While the idea Is nice, and flying for the first time is fun, I felt Bored almost immediatly, The game is really repetitive and the controls offer no challenge.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|i loved the music on this cd. great music. cant wait for the next to be released. so so good.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I was skeptical at first because I keep hearing how portable amps are horrible but this actually works quite well. The only down side to it is the bass boost feature is a little quirky ( I have to put it in the middle for it to properly work.) I deffinetly suggest this amp as it is portable and not expensive.
0689835604|5.0|I don't know what it is about this book, but my baby gets so excited whenever I pull it out to read to him.  He's only 10 months so he's definitely too young to lift the flaps himself, but he loves having it read to him and smiles and giggles whenever the flaps are lifted to reveal the body part.  It's adorable.<br /><br />The book itself is wonderful.  It's a sturdy board book, but the flaps are thinner material.  If you leave the book alone with really young kids there's a definite risk they'll rip the flaps right off.  The solution?  Don't leave it alone with babies.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I am a total cat lover which is why I bought this book. It took me a while to get used to the \\"Englander\\" talk but I found myself reading in an accent through the book. I loved this story and would recommend it to other cat and animal lovers out there
1582701709|4.0|Interesting book, enjoyed the concept, I don't totally agree with the total simplicity of The Secret.  Book arrived promptly & in good condition.

B00AALHW6Y|5.0|i loved the music on this cd. great music. cant wait for the next to be released. so so good.
B00E3D7WGU|2.0|I was so excited that Madonna was finally releasing an official entire  concert on CD. Did not expect the CD to sound like concert studio versions with a canned audience and Madonna's live vocals mixed poorly. I'm listening to this album as I write this, and I am stunned how awful the sound quality is.This release sucks all the energy out of the live performances. This becomes clearly evident by the first bars of the opener \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", The music sounds flat and Madonna's voice is mixed in a way to suggest she singing over a cheap karaoke machine. The sound improves marginally during the the super short version of \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" but as soon as \\"Hung Up\\" starts the sound flatlines again. \\"Like A Prayer\\" is completely ruined by the flat sound and the awful audience participation. There are a few tracks that manage to capture some of the magic i.e. Vogue, Justify My Love otherwise this is the most disappointing Madonna audio release in her 30+ year career. I'm well aware that this is a direct rip from the concert audio (which I don't have a problem with)but the lazy editing lets on well after the \\"Celebration\\" finale and you're left listening to random backstage noise until Madonna says \\"that's it ,let's go home\\". This release is strictly for the eyes and not the ears, meaning just get the DVD (apparently the blu-ray is having major sound issues).This album sounds like a bootleg that you would you get from one of those unofficial Madonna sites not an official release. Madonna fans deserve better from BoyToy Inc. and Live Nation.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|EVERYTHING in the title!<br />This CD goes<br />Where no disc has done<br />Buy it now! YAY!<br /><br />Seriously thisnis the best music to play with te windows down in the car blaring. Epic driving!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is great for all ages. The graphics are incredible, and the world is really big and full of surprises. I highly recommend this game.

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I was glad to be able to get Jack Reacher.  I had seen it on Netflix and decided then and there when I could buy it I would.  I like action movies and am a Tom Cruise fan.<br /><br />I bought Midnight in Paris for two reasons, one I liked the movie and I had just returned from Paris and it was fun to see the places I visited in the movie.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the different ring tones and all of the faces are beautiful. It is great to know the weather before my feet even hit the floor!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Equal parts action, suspense, mythology, magic. Nothing like a 2000 year old druid and his trusty Irish wolfhound to tell an amazing story and keep this reader flipping the pages.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I really loved, loved, loved this book. It has built its own little world in a new age and in my heart. I think it's going to be a lot harder than I thought to forget it. It has its moments of joy but deep sadness to I remember laughing and my eyes brimming with tears, but I'm really NOT a emotional person. LOVE IT! Bye.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Loved the scenery, the costumes, and the music - all mixed together with Leonardo, it was a very entertaining movie!

B002I0J5FG|5.0|I love these two games together. I was never able to find ICO by itself.  I can't stop playing this game.
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|It's a shame that this is so overpriced.  The best show on TV now has a black eye.  Total \\"cash-grab\\" from the manufacturer, AMC, whomever.  Also, a totally weak set of extras included.  An apron?  Seriously?  How insulting.  I wish i could give it NO STARS.  Save your money, and get them individually, or wait for the price on this to drop.  This is almost as bad as the INSANELY overpriced \\"Dexter\\" series set.  Check that out if you want another great laugh.
B003F29D44|5.0|I learnt a lot of lessons from this movie. I will recommend this movie to any one in the corporate world to watch.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was great. I was hooked instantly. This genre isn't what I normally read, but I got into it since it was apart of my book club. Now I am flying through the rest of the books.<br />You will fall in love with the characters and the action depicted in each chapter.<br /><br />Read them! I promise you won't be disappointed. The movies on the other hand...terrible. They don't do the books justice!

B00CXL6XP0|5.0|'Fallout' is a great Queensryche song.<br /><br />This album reminds me of why Queensryche became my favorite group in the late 80's and early 90's.<br /><br />I'm very impressed with Todd La Torre on the new stuff and am surprised at how good his covers of the old songs are.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I liked all the heros.  However, I didn't like the depiction of the Hulk.  Why the decision was made to make him appear more &#34;Gorilla&#34; like in just a couple of scenes made no sense to me.  Oh and the voice work when he did speak was horrible.
B00EMJD6TC|2.0|All in all it was crap!!  Its hard for me to put into words what was crap about it but it was crap.  The zombies were not zombies, the U.N. in real life is effectively worthless, and there were too many instances of stupid people surviving.  I like Brad Pitt like man crush like him but \\"Fight Club this was not\\".  His performance was lackluster and he honestly seemed tired the whole movie. Not I'm being chased by zombies tired but god I can't believe I'm in this movie tired.  But most of all I hated the ending. OH MY F***ING GOD the ending was just freaking stupid. And honestly what did he inject?  Would have been funny if it was polio or anthrax. I'd say it was a 2 star movie but only cause I like Brad Pitt.
B00004YM0D|5.0|the CD is great. I listen to it every day. Takes me back to the 60's. Love it, great purchase.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Links more clock face choices and songs. Glad to have a clock app on my kindle. Has all the basics with weather as an extra!

B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I thought Ryan Gosling was great.  I don't care too much for the dark noir movies.  It was too dark  visually sometimes and hard to see.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Similar to &#34;Like Clockwork&#34; yet different. Is a throwback to the old Euro-tech. Refreshingly new! Great introduction for new listeners.

B004BSFSTA|5.0|It works perfectly. A great product I would surely recommend! The sound is great and the look lovely! Love them!
B008JFUPFI|2.0|Based on the trailer, I thought this would be a fantastic movie, but it failed to deliver. Apart from the fight scenes that were just too long, I didn't feel like there was enough of an internal conflict (which since Superman is invincible is the only good superman plot you can have in my opinion). I never saw Superman himself lean towards not helping people. There were outside forces telling him to hide his powers, but he never had that Peter Parker moment, if you will (the tornado scene doesn't count- that was just Papa Kent being dumb. He went to save his dog and wouldn't let the invincible guy do it. What was he thinking?) Besides that, the rest of the plot just seems rushed through to make room for fight scenes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just as great as the first two seasons!  I can't get enough, I devour each season of this show in a week or two.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent, full-featured calculator app- simple and easy to use, yet robust if needed for scientific or accounting purposes. Does what it intends to do very well.

B002LC8HF0|5.0|So much better ending than we got with wheel of time. Thank you Mr Sanderson! Perhaps you can consider making a sequel to the wheel of time books...
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Am I the only one who thinks that the store prices r a bit expensive? With those prices I won't b buying anything 4 a while. :( That is the only negative thing I have 2 say about this game!! For a free game it is really awesome!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This film is a classic. It is nice to have it on dvd now instead of the old vhs :0)
B00BTHWFEC|4.0|Sabbath have a lot of good albums, so even their 15th best LP is a good listen. This is purposefully more in the style of their 1st 3 LPs than the later 5 proggier (for sabbath) Ozzy albums, all Dio era records, Born Again, and the 8 or so albums with singers you probably never heard of unless you followed Black Sabbath through the mid80s-1995. This was not an unexpected move but it's been 40+ years since Master of Reality so it's kind of a trying-too-hard way of making an album. However it's Tony Iommi so the riffs are solid even when they are derivative of past glories. There are traces of Iommi's post 1980 style but this is pretty much exactly what it is advertised as, another Ozzy era Sabbath album.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|Still getting the hang of this program but it is very simple to use. I don't do a lot on my pad, but it really helps keep me on my schedule. .
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this game for fun and its great and if you want to bypass the friends glitch start by saying your age is 10 you start with 9 rubies but 4friends and get a heart every 6 or so.  Rubies are easy to get so with a little patience you can have everything.. I am level 38 and still having a great time. Great job gameloft. I spent 5$ for rubies because I love the game not because I had to. To naysayers have some patience.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|this movie has giant monsters fighting giant robots. if you're not into cool things like that, you won't like this. otherwise, this movie is super fun.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I bought the 405CX from Amazon nearly two years ago. It has been my first GPS watch and I enjoy being able to review the information about my runs. To give you an idea of how much I use this watch, I ran every day in 2012 and run between 30-50 miles per week. I wear this watch for every run unless the battery is dead or I can't find it. It is not my main watch because it's a little big and needs to be charged at times.<br /><br />Considering this watch as a training tool, it's great. I used to have certain routes that I would run because I knew where the mile markers were. With this watch, I am free to make course changes at any time and still track my splits and see it all on a map when I get home.<br /><br />While it's a great training tool, it's not a great watch. The main drawback of this watch is the touch bezel. I live in South Texas, so when I run, I sweat. This isn't usually a big issue with this watch because I am able to lock the bezel and have my time, distance run, and average pace for the mile I am running. This is more information than most watches give me. The problem is if I want to find out what time it is during a run. I have to unlock the bezel then, using the touch bezel, switch the watch to the time of day. The problem is that my fingers are sweaty. When the bezel senses water/sweat on the bezel, it reacts as if it's a touch. The watch starts going crazy switching screens and I can't tell what time of day it is or how the run is going. To be fair, this generally only happens once a week when I'm on a long run and trying to figure out how much time I have to get home so that I can get to church.<br /><br />The other issue is that twice, I have had to do a factory reset because the watch has started acting berserk. Not a huge issue since set-up is easy, but still not an issue it should be having.<br /><br />Despite these problems, I love this watch and what it is able to do for me. As a watch it is not as good as the Ironmans that I used the 20 years before this, but it excels as a training tool.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game! The game has the right amount of both Mahjong play and storyline,which keeps the game more interesting and less monotonous.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Easy to use and I use it a lot to optimize my tablet since I have a lot of apps I use.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie is fantastic! Great voice acting and great animation. The story/plot is simple, but extremely well executed with some deep moments for this genre. It's right up there with &#34;How To Train Your Dragon&#34; (which I consider THE BEST). Must viewing for gamers and those who love arcades.
B00BHBBSZ2|1.0|I liked the idea of being able to write down my notes, but the app would freeze when I opened it and there were not any notes to help me navigate the app.<br /><br />Also, I tried to copy/paste something from the internet into the notepad. It was working but it became so sloooowww and eventually froze whenever I tried to move up/down the document. All I wanted was an app where I can copy/paste things when using my Kindle.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|As usual, I was not able to put this book down once it started.  It leaves you wondering &#34;what next&#34; at every turn.  The man difference between this book and other Grisham books is believability. While most his books are fiction, they are believable.  This one however is pure fantasy.  So lay back, and take a ride in the Grisham Fantasy Wagon, I'm sure you'll enjoy it
B005LAIH2M|4.0|This is fun movie with great visuals and fantastic acting!  Ha! Ha! Just kidding about the acting. Watch it drunk, it's much better.
0553573403|5.0|In highschool I stopped just sitting down and reading because of my busy schedule, but when I had time during the summer I decided to try and start reading again. I could not put this book down. The book is fantasy, but the plot line s are really twisted and catches you off guard. George R.R. Martin does a great job of connecting the reader to the book's characters so much so you feel their emotions. The bindings can get messed up since it is a paperback, but that doesn't diminish the quality of this book.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|this isn't usless but no one has read it!!!!!! I was just messing around with it wouldn't even the rest of my life to finish it. would take me more but I wouldn't have time.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is as close as you can get to a console game. And for FREE. The multiplayer is spectacular. I had no lag at all. My only complaint is the lack of maps and game varients. But the gameplay blew me away. I've never seen a mobile game like this.

B009AMAGXK|3.0|Interesting visuals, but kind of a dull story-line/plot. The performances were as good as they can be, given the material.
B003F9G8B8|3.0|You will understand the significant events of the actual story after watching the film, but the characters will feel a bit like cutouts from from a history book. It is a competent film that had great promise, but you will wish it were better.

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Spoilers:<br /><br />Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is reduced in rank when he and the crew try and save a civilization threatened by a massive volcanic eruption. Kirk violated the Prime Directive in the process of saving these people and Spock's life. Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood--a great actor well cast)takes command of the Enterprise back from Kirk and convinces Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) to let Kirk be his First Officer while Spock is reassigned.<br /><br />Deciminated by a terrorist attack by a former Star Fleet member John Anderson (Benedict Cumberbatch), Marcus allows Kirk to take command of the Enterprise to hunt down Anderson and kill him. Unforunately for Kirk and his crew they discover a conspiracy that leads back deep into the heart of Star Fleet putting them at risk from both their own and Anderson.<br /><br />End of Spoilers:<br /><br />The second film in the reboot for Star Trek isn't quite as consistent as the first but it does build on the characters.<br /><br />How Does it Look? \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" looks marvelous with rich detail and depth to the image. The 3D version looks nice for a post-production conversion (it wasn't shot in 3D)but, at times, suffers from \\"viewmaster syndrome\\" i.e., while the image has depth it doesn't look as natural as 3D productions shot in the format. The dark look of the film also can be an issue at times but, overall, the 3D version looks pretty good.<br /><br />The conventional Blu-ray has amazing depth, detail and I didn't note any artifacts on first viewing making this a demo disc for me.<br /><br />The audio is lossless and sounds terrific. Audio is also presented in 5.1 for the following: French, Spanish and also has English Audio Description. We get subtitles in a variety of languages including English, French, Spanish and Portuguese.<br /><br />The seven featurettes on included with the disc are solid but could have been far more indepth. We get the following featurettes that run from 2 to 8 minutes: Creating the Red Planet focuses on the opening sequence and how the world we see was created with CG and practical effects;Attack on Starfleet; The Klingon Home World focuses on the reimagined Klingon's;The Enemy of My Enemy features Abrams and Cumberbatch discussing the villian of the film; Ship to Ship with previz compared to final footage and Brawl by the Bay focusing on Spock's fight at the conclusion.<br /><br />For a big title like this there is always the chance you're going to be double dipped and all those special features that were spread out among three different retailers will, later, show up in a deluxe edition. It just sucks that Paramount's marketing department has decided to do this to fans. It was an unfortunate decision on Paramount's marketing department that will prevent many fans from buying this as very few people will want to purchase three copies of the same movie on Blu-ray just to get all the special features.<br /><br />\\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\" fuses elements of the reboot with a classic Trek bad guy and elements from other classic Trek episodes to create a compelling, entertaining fushion that touches on \\"Trek\\" as well as J.J. Abrams favorite movie \\"Star Wars\\". He does a pretty darn good job of fusing the two making Kirk a combination of the classic character we know and love with Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. While the characters of Spock and Uhura are given the Han Solo/Leia romance elements. Scotty seems to be Chewbacca.<br /><br />An entertaining combination of \\"Trek\\" with Abrams other space opera influences (mainly \\"Star Wars\\"), \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" displeased many long time \\"Trek\\" fans (it was voted one of the worst \\"Trek\\" films ever at a \\"Star Trek\\" website)but I think time will prove that to be incorrect.g the Red Planet focuses on the opening sequence and how the world we see was created with CG and practical effects;Attack on Starfleet; The Klingon Home World focuses on the reimagined Klingon's;The Enemy of My Enemy features Abrams and Cumberbatch discussing the villian of the film; Ship to Ship with previz compared to final footage and Brawl by the Bay focusing on Spock's fight at the conclusion.<br /><br />For a big title like this there is always the chance you're going to be double dipped and all those special features that were spread out among three different retailers will, later, show up in a deluxe edition.

B00DC8O6T8|4.0|The song &#34;Safe and Sound&#34; is a standout on this album. The other songs are more funky-pop-jazz that are cool to listen to, but don't have the hook that &#34;Safe and Sound&#34; has. But, I like it all together and look forward to future releases from this very artistic group.

B008JFUNYG|1.0|Seemingly an excuse to deep into fanboys pockets and attempt to connect with new fans of gore, this film was senseless and added nothing new to the franchise. Fan boys eat crow.
B008220BP2|4.0|Didn't know what to expect; actually thought it might be stupid. But, not at all! It's a very cute and warm (see what I did there?) story with some very funny moments. Watch the gag reel in the extras!

B009POCG0Y|4.0|Killer Joe is a movie that isn't for everyone and if you like offbeat, strange and deranged you just might find enjoyment on the end of this films rainbow!! Great acting, standard money thievery twist but it worked well. It was cool to see something fairly unique swimming against the current in this modern era of remakes and sequels.

0345537998|4.0|George R. R. Martin is prolific but not punctual - and so as millions await the next installment of The Song of Ice and Fire, Bantam Books had to settle for repackaging a series of Martin's novellas to try and satisfy the masses.<br /><br />\\"Tuf Voyaging\\" (Bantam, $16, 440 pages) chronicles the adventures of the rather odd Haviland Tuf in a familiar space opera setting: Tramp freighters flitting from world to world in a wide universe melded together by various federations and alliances.<br /><br />There are seven pieces in the book, all written between 1976 and 1985, and they range in quality from excellent (\\"The Plague Star\\") to filler (\\"Manna from Heaven\\"). That said, Martin's filler is as good as most writers' best efforts, so \\"Tuf Voyaging\\" is an engaging, if not substantial, read.<br /><br />To reveal much more than I have already would spoil the fun of \\"Plague Star,\\" which begins the collection, so I'll leave it at this: Yes, the material is from early in his career, but even though it's not fully realized Martin, it's still awfully good.
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|I consider the original Fright Night a classic and this piece of garbage is nothing more than an attempt to make money. Everything about this pile of turds stinks to high heaven and should be avoided like wars in the Middle East.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a fun book to explore energy in motion. It is written well, simply but thorough, and introduces the concept of the field of potentiality with examples that you can try for yourself. The author said to give each experiment 24 hrs, I found that most of them only needed about 10 minutes to an hour to make me go, &#34;Wow!&#34; Plus, I got a download for about $2.50 or something ridiculous like that so it was a no brainer.

B00ACHXHII|5.0|I must admit that the name of Constantin Silvestri has really only shown up on my radar as the definitive conductor of the definitive recording of Elgar's \\"In The South\\". When I bought the big EMI set of \\"Elgar the Collector's Edition\\" it was not included. Surprised? Perhaps. Then I look in one of my old Penguin guides and notice that there was a release of Silvestri's Tchaikovsky Symphonies 4-6 on a label that I hadn't heard of. The review gave it this rating: *(**). Beware! But the review below was 4 times as long as the reviews of the other recordings (Karajan was one, I think) and this piqued my interest. I was reminded of Stokowski as I read the review - in the 4th symphony Silvestri changes the rhythm of the \\"Fate\\" motif from the very start and every time that it comes in the piece it is played in the same rhythm. Not a primary recommendation, then! After all, who wants to recommend for the first time listener a recording that wreaks havoc with the composer's intentions? But I have so many recordings of the 4th that for me, a change of pace is welcome. I know how it's supposed to go! So recordings for the seasoned listener then! Disconcerting as this rhythmic anamoly is, Silvestri's performance wins me over. It's so hard to choose a best recording nowadays and its fruitless to do so. The Fifth is memorable for a lightening-fast coda for the finale, a trend that he must have received from Furtwangler's Beethoven 9th, and one he uses in the Capriccio Italien as well as the Capriccio Espagnol. These are the warnings, dear reader, of the idiosyncracies of this box set that costs so little and has so much music in it. The sound quality is very good for the time and I only balked at the boomy sound of \\"Sheherazade\\", which for me didn't top my two favorites Monteux and Kondrashin. It would be too hard to dissect and analyze every performance here. Certainly the Dvorak recordings sound right (although I'm sick of the New World Symphony, perhaps some day I'll warm up to this work which I listened to day in and day out over a year before I discovered the fifth) and the 7th a total surprise! I didn't know he recorded these works and I'm glad I made their acquaintance. Dear reader, you should too and decide for yourself before these rare (for me) recordings are not available anymore (except on Spotify).o this work which I listened to day in and day out over a year before I discovered the fifth) and the 7th a total surprise!

B001DHXT6G|5.0|As a lifelong fan of Star Trek The Original series, I can say that as a Trekkie (yes I'm not afraid to call myself that) I was concerned when I heard that a digital reworking of the space and special effect scenes had been done. For years now I have labored over whether I should buy the newly refreshed set or not. It's one thing to clean up original films and crispen up their color palettes and improve the soundtracks, its something else altogether to change the extremely recognizable if not always revered historical context of an iconic show such as Star Trek. Other icons like Star Wars episodes 4,5 and 6 and E.T. received reworkings and they fell flatter than a pancake, after all.<br /><br />Well, finally I gave in, and WOW am I happy that I did. The people at Paramount have gone to great pains to brag about certain space scene heavy episodes such as Balance Of Terror, The Corbomite Manuever and of course, The Doomsday Machine, and yet, while those shows do wow on a whole new level with the new treatment, there are countless other moments that are smaller in scale that ad to the experience. It's amazing the effects we take for granted today in other movies and even the Star Trek Universe. This new rendering of the classic show now finally measures up to it's other TV show siblings, most notably, Next Generation.<br /><br />Each of the planets is now completely unique and we get multiple angles rather than the same orbit angle seen again and again. Ship manuevers during movement and battles is more realistic. Thankfully, they didn't change the transporter beam sequences, but they did provide more accurate settings for the show's stars to beam into. Those familiar with the lustrous but one dimensional paintings that were provided as occasional backdrops will be awestruck at their newfound three dimensional realism.<br /><br />Even simple touches like in Amok Time, when Spock is looking at a picture of T'pring as a child on his monitor, adding the outdoor backgroundof Vulcan complete with other Vulcans adds to the realism of the tumultuous time Spock is going through in contrast to the original photo with a flat, grey background that appeared to have been taken against one of the enterprise walls (and probably was, budgets being so short and all). That small touch and several others like it are things that as a Trekkie you may not have even considered before, but they add a welcome warmth. Even Mr. Sulu's analog 1960's clock radio style chronometer gets a modern refresher.<br /><br />There is little doubt that Roddenberry himself would find all of the work done on his iconic show to be a welcome update, as he was thrilled when The Next Generation hit the airwaves. Sure, the space and special effects scenes are secondary to the overall plots that involve facets far more important that have to do with events, consequences, struggles, humbling, and triumphs of humanity, but The Next Generation proved that you could have all of that and still do incredible effects. Indeed, if Gene had the budget and if it were possible to achieve this level of effects when the show was created, he surely would have done it this way.<br /><br />One thing that should have been left alone however, is the theme in the opening credits of season 2 and 3. The woman they chose to re-do the operatic theme has a lovely voice, but it is jarring to so change the theme. You wouldn't think something could be so obtrusive, but it is. The first season's opening theme update was beautifully rendered in modern tone and clarity, however.<br /><br />All in all, the changes offered us were welcome ones that make going where no man has gone before a completely new and vivid experience all over again. Beam me up, Scotty!

B00BC24NT4|1.0|Unsatisfying ending.  Unending liberal stereotypes of the right.  Boring characters with implausible concern for a minor blown operation.  If you're a far, far left Brit you'll love this book.  Anyone else...not so much.

It was important to tell the life story of Mrs. Lacks for the reader to truly understand the level of violation that took place with her and her children. While medical history was made using her cells without consent; just as important companies were developed and flourished exploiting the families unique genetic make-up. and apparently they have no recourse. The least that should be done is a monetary amount should be given to the remaining children and trust fund established for their heirs to cover the 60 years of profit from which they were excluded
B00BBW15R8|5.0|My wife wanted me to watch this (I'm a guy and like &#34;guy&#34; movies). But being the giver that I am I relented and watched it with her (she bribed me with ice cream).

0399159347|4.0|Cecilia Fitzpatrick is the perfect mother and wife. She adores her handsome and successful husband and three lovely daughters. She's super organized. She's the president of the parents' association at St. Angela's Primary School. She's a successful consultant for Tupperware. Every other woman admires and despises Cecilia and her seemingly perfect life.<br /><br />Searching for something in the attic, Cecilia discovers a sealed letter addressed to her from her husband to be read after his death. Intrigued, confused and concerned, Cecilia must confront the mysteries and secrets from her husband's past in The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty.<br /><br />Told from the perspective of several characters whose lives will become entwined within the novel, The Husband's Secret held me spellbound for several days. The characters are so rich and honest, so real that I found myself stressing over their situations and choices. Though it took me a few chapters to get used to the rambling, almost stream-of-consciousness style, I ended up really appreciating the true and honest look into the characters' minds as they weigh the options and potential consequences of their various choices.<br /><br />While the ending ties everything up a bit too coincidentally and conveniently (it's karma, baby), it's also an example of what we love about fiction. I'm all for the edgy, depressing endings in literature but sometimes it is nice to have a \\"good\\" ending that still leaves you breathless and reflective.<br /><br />Compelling and impassioned, I was engrossed in the lives of the characters of The Husband's Secret and thoroughly enjoyed the novel.

But, mostly it effected my heart!

B009JBZH54|5.0|After the disappointing films: Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, I almost didn't see Batman Begins! I'm glad my brother talked me into it, for I liked it better than the two Tim Burton films put together! The Dark Knight was better than that! The Dark Knight Rises was better than the excellent Batman Begins! What made The Dark Knight so special was the late Heath Ledger's performance as the joker, he tops Jack Nicholson! He even won an Oscar for this film! My mum hates Batman, but she likes watching him!  Chris Nolan is a great director too! Richard Donner made me believe a man can fly! Chris Nolan made me believe an orphan can fight crime so no other kids become orphans! I liked how this explains why he dresses like a bat! Tim Burton's film only joked about it!  Scarecrow, Joker, Two Face, Bane & Catwoman all come into play in this epic trilogy! Fans of the comics (or even Arkham Asylum & Arkham City) may remeber Ra's Al Ghoul! In this, Bruce Wayne learns from his warriors! Even Tim Burton didn't explain where he got his fighting skills! Can't explain away everything without spoiling anyone who hasn't seen it! Believe it or not: I know people who haven't watch Batman Begins, let alone the other two!! I've read he fights Superman! Comics have had two good guys fight each other, but I didn't expect a movie based on it! Wouldn't Batman need Kryptonite inlaid gloves to beat an invincible man?

0765365278|3.0|When I first starting reading this novel, I literally laughed out loud at the first line. It was so ridiculously FANTASY that it felt way overwrought. Now don't get me wrong- I love me some nerdy books. But it felt like Sanderson was basically shouting at me \\"HEY, THIS IS A FANTASY NOVEL FULL OF MAGIC AND MYSTERIES UNTOLD!!!!\\" It put me off. The worldbuilding felt much more forced than anything I've read before. I suppose this could be because the world he created is truly unique in many ways, so maybe he felt like he had to explain things more to the readers? But the effect came off to me as unnatural, with Sanderson *telling* me all about how special everything was, rather than letting me *see* it through description.<br /><br />As I continued reading, Sanderson continued to yell things at my brain. \\"HEY, SEE THIS THING I'M MENTIONING SO CASUALLY EVERY OTHER PAGE??\\" Yes, sir, I've noticed that. You're very subtle. I'd like to get on with th-\\" \\"NO, REALLY! HERE IT IS AGAIN! SOOOO CASUAL.\\" Yup, got it. I see your deft touch there. Very nice. \\"I'M USING FORESHADOWING!! ITS CASUAL SO YOU'LL NEEEEEEEEVER SEE THE \\"TWIST\\"!!!\\"<br /><br />Yeah.....kinda ruins the big major plot twist reveal at the end if you've been beat over the head with \\"foreshadowing\\" since page 10. It irritated me the entire time. I felt insulted. I know how plot works, thanks. You should give your readers a little more credit.<br /><br />HOWEVER. About 4 months after I finished reading it, I suddenly got the story stuck in my head. It kept playing over and over like a movie until I had to read it again. It is really a fun story, with enjoyable characters and an intriguing plot. It took me a while to get over my irritation, but once time smoothed out those rough edges I found I could actually enjoy the story for what it was meant to be. So, final verdict: I definitely look forward to the next installment of the series. I hope he can show a little more faith in the intelligence of readers, but at leastI'm better prepared for narrative brain-bashing.

B0009P5YXO|3.0|I purchased this item for my daughter, she loves it for what it represents, but even she thought it was cheaply made.  Coolness factor is a five, but the quality factor is a two.
B00CTT9646|5.0|This item was better than expected. I was sure it was going to have a plastic phaser but it is metal and has some heft to it. The movie is great, I saw it in the theater once and will watch it again and again.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Great show from the 90s!  I have watched every episode from every season and I still enjoy watching it- glad I bought the entire series!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great character development, and kept moving.  I generally don't read books this fast, I  couldn't wait to get to the next page. Love how all of the characters had their own stories, but yet were also intertwined.  Highly recommend this one.
B003INBOEM|5.0|IP Man is an awesome flick and based on a true story! It was hard to believe a sequel could be better than this one, but my wife and I both agreed that IP Man 2 was even better!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This was a very good deal for both seasons at a fraction of what it would cost in stores. Such a great series, very pleased.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I used to have this on my phone and it was great to pass the time.<br />Now I have it on my tablet and it plays so much better. Great game for<br />Relaxed playing.
1439192812|5.0|While targeted at younger readers, the clarity of explanation has a lot to offer adult readers also.  Beautiful illustrations too, but on a few pages they made reading the text a bit challenging.  Highly recommended.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I read a lot of books but this one is going to be my favorite can't wait to buy  book 2
B001BZE82E|1.0|I brought it online but after seeing it, it is not what I was expecting.<br />the dial is completed plastic body. and its look is also not good as compare to its prise.<br /><br />The $50 prise is very very very coastly for such watch. it looks like it is worth to $10-$15.<br /><br />I am thinking to return this watch as I really dont like it..
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|A must have for any serious Harry Head - Very Happy - Love the additional audio clips / out-takes and history items
B004KO8036|5.0|I picked up this album a little more then a week ago and I love it!  I have been listing to it over and over and I just ordered their 1st album.  Their video's are funny but don't let that over shadow their music. They are an awesome band and the music sounds much better on CD then on you tube.  Support them! They're the real deal.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Received one yesterday. I setup the device on Android phone. It was easy and straightforward. YouTube and Netflix were up running in no time. One thing you may pay attention is that the device only supports 2.4G Wi-Fi. If you have a dual band router, usually you will see two SSIDs on your phone. For example, NETGEAR and NETGEAR-5G. Connect with NETGEAR. Hope it helps.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Probably my favorite mobile game I've ever played. Super addicting. I can't wait until the third one haha. Keep it up.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|You get points for gift cards just for looking at the weather channel every day. It's always working and never down. One of the best weather apps out there.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This album is easily my favorite full effort by Janelle. The first EP was too short so it is hard to fault that effort. ArchAndroid seemed as if she was shooting from the hip to tribute ALL of her musical inspirations on one album. Her voice is so compatible with so many genres that she couldn't contain herself. As a result, I think it didn't really focus in on a target market or sound. She had some good songs but the album was probably a bit hard to promote.<br /><br />In steps Electric Lady. Thankfully, Q.U.E.E.N. was a masterstroke single to announce her return. It's funky and is quite different from her other dance tracks past and present. It set the table for this album in a way that certified the buzz and heightened the anticipation.<br /><br />Now that the album is here I can't help but notice that it sounds like a Jackson 5/The Jacksons tribute album to a point. The sound of a large portion of the songs is decidedly funky in a soft way (if that makes any sense). It's kind of like \\"Off the Wall\\" MJ and The Jacksons when they did love songs or smooth songs. She even channels Stevie and Debarge at times to kind of round out the feel of the album. Of course, if you get the Target special edition this makes even more sense because she includes a great remake of \\"I Want You Back\\".<br /><br />What gets me though are the Prince and Miguel selections. The song she does with Prince,\\"Givin Em What They Love\\", is ok and doesn't blow me away like I was hoping. Instead, the song with Miguel is smooth and sexy in a way that essentially channels Prince's great love songs from back in the day. I was listening to \\"PrimeTime\\" thinking that Prince should have just hopped on this song and did the guitar solo to extend this sexy jam for another minute or so.<br /><br />Great songs. Great mood. Get it!
B001AK3S3U|1.0|Ice Cube?  Really?  An action star?  Just on that premise alone I didn't have high hopes for this movie but I gave it a shot anyway.  One hour into it and I couldn't stand it anymore.  I don't know what they were thinking making this horrible sequel to an okay movie in the first place.  At least Diesel was able to carry the part because he's a much better candidate as an action star.  The problem is the expectations going into a movie like this and then it turns out to be a snorefest with a bunch of explosions and terrible acting from the lead \\"actor\\".
0763660531|5.0|This is, in my opinion, an essential book for parents and non-parents alike.  It is a work of literature, stunning in its artistry, poetic in its imagery, minimalism, and allusions.<br /><br />What you have here is a wordless storybook.  It is, I would suggest, more a work of art, a collection of linked paintings that tell a story.  Our main character (nameless), seeks refuge from her disconnected life in the adventures she creates with her red crayon.  Sound like a book we've all read and loved?  Stay with me.  She journeys, with her crayon, into a beautifully imagined world and an adventure.  I really don't want to ruin the BRILLIANT (boy how I wish FB would let me italicize) twist ending, but I will say that this is so much more than an homage to HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON, it is an extension of it, a tribute to it, a joining of worlds.<br /><br />I read this book with my three-and-a-half-year-old son last night and he was enthralled.  In spite of the fact that there were no words, he was gripped.  Why?  The lack of a defined way of telling this story allowed us to tell it ourselves.  Tonight, when we read it again, it will be slightly different.  New words will be used to give voice to the story told through the images.  Every time we read this book, it will become new.  That is special.<br /><br />I can't speak highly enough of this book.  Even as an adult I read it and appreciate what it does.  Absolutely stunning.  Brilliant in every way.  Please, do yourself a favor, spend the fourteen or fifteen bucks and get this.  Cherish it.  Because your child (or you) will read it at 3, at 5, at 10, at 16, at 30, at 80.  This is a book I would, as a teacher, work into units from kindergarten through graduate school. How many books can you say that about? Incredible.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Was very entertaining but energy goes to fast, also i wish there were more ways of earning diamonds and also work out some glitches
125000098X|5.0|I could not put the book down.  I have read all three and will continue to read until the end of the fifth book.  I was disappointed when I reached the end and discovered I would have to wait to find out what is going to happen to Sebastian and Jessica. But----I can wait!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Why yes. I have owned this mouse for months now and It has not given me any problems at all I enjoy all of the programmable buttons and the dpi changer is nice. The mouse just feels like its molded to,your hand. Overall I say get it. You really can't beat the price on this quality.
B000FCKC4M|4.0|Long, tedious, maybe necessary to get the message. I got tired of the meandering and yet can reflect on the need to do so,for one to appreciate the journey.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Cannot wait until Season 4 comes out. A most excellent drama that nobody should miss. I hope the men's country squire fashion comes back into style.
B00C9NSSI2|3.0|Love the guitar. Song writing and vocal delivery left me generally unimpressed. I expected a little more power and grace, and got a good guitar album. meh.
B00CTT9646|3.0|Save yourself the $55 bucks and just buy the 3D, blueray, digital standalone issue.  The phaser is cool if your a hardcore fan but it is flawed.  There is no collectors certificate of authenticity, The paint job has numerous visible runs and blotches.  The Stun/Kill mechanism does spin but does not line up with the center once it's in position.  It is also the only moving part.  It does fit into it's stand very well though.  I would have paid $20 bucks for the phaser, that's all its worth.
B0095P31L6|4.0|5 minutes in I wasn't expecting to enjoy this but Rango gets better as the movie goes on. My teenage son even sat through the whole thing! It's a great family movie.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I read his previous books & really enjoyed them. I was looking forward to this book & was  very disappointed. It seemed to go on & on & on. And it jumped & sometimes I found it confusing. I made myself finish the book to see if I would be satisfied
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great book, but wish there was a better ending. Dropped off too quickly.<br />Will definitely read more of her books!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love this movie; I enjoyed the first one and second is better than the first. Great movie any fan of Star Trek will love this
B0019EXZYE|1.0|The disk was scratched due to not be handled properly.  It was a good movie but I am unhappy with the product integrity.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The limitations in what you can actually stream, even though this claims it can stream anything in a tab.. is very disappointing.<br /><br />Why no Amazon Instant Video?  That is a fair assumption that I should be able to watch any video I can see in a Chrome Browser, cast to my tv.<br /><br />Is this ridiculous turf battles? or is the tech just not up to snuff?<br /><br />thanks for opening my eyes to streaming dongles, but Chromecast is certainly not going to last in my house.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I had never seen these movies, and when I saw them at such a great price, I just couldn't pass them up. I am very happy with my purchase.
B00368PSN2|5.0|a good si-fi movie, it had lot of action and scenic background, a good story too. Jim  Caviezel acting was great and worth watching this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have set this connected to the TV in the main room of my condo for my roommates and I to use. It's a great low-profile, cheap way to make any TV a &#34;smart&#34; TV. If you've ever used the PS3's versions of Youtube or Netflix apps, they are essentially identical. The advantage the Chromecast has over other settop boxes is that it's always on and listening for requests to play videos. So as long as you have it plugged in (via USB to your TV or via wall adapter), your mobile device will detect and connect to the dongle.<br /><br />Google has cleverly used HDMI-CEC to allow the Chromecast to turn on and switch input so as soon as you select a video to play, it is on your screen. It's difficult to understate the difference this makes for your streaming experience. With the PS3/XBox, you have to turn on the box, turn on the TV, sign in, open the netflix app, and pick the video to play. With Chromecast you just open the app, select the video, and set it to play on your TV.<br /><br />The value of this device is greatly increased if you're a subscriber to Google Play Music All Access, which I am. Then you can also sling any song on the subscription service to play on your TV's speakers. Eventually, more services will pop up, like Pandora, Hulu+, Revision3, Vimeo, and hopefully Spotify. Right now Google is stubbornly sitting on its hands and refusing to open access to the final Chromecast API, holding all of these apps back.<br /><br />There are some downsides. There is another streaming option that allows you to mirror the content of any Chrome tab on your screen, including any websites with flash or HTML5 content (legal or not ;) ). I hoped this would enable me to watch more...grey area content on my TV, but unfortunately the Chrome extension is still very beta. Quality is not the greatest even at the highest settings. Connecting a PC to your TV via HDMI is still better in this case.<br /><br />The dongle itself doesn't have the greatest wifi reception either. When Ifirst plugged it in it was behind the TV and was not able to connect, but I moved it to a side HDMI port and used the included extender to get it to peek around the side of the TV, which solved the problem. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Overall, at this price it is an instinct buy IMO. When the Chromecast API opens more developers will enable their apps to use the service and it will quickly surpass game consoles as a streaming solution.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Started watching SOA and season 1 was a little hard for me to get into, not being a biker and such. But the acting was really good, and the characters played their parts. Season 2 was amazing! They really hooked you right from the start. So far, it's my favorite season.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Purchased this for my 9 year old granddaughter. She loves it. She has added it to her &#34;Favorite Movie&#34; list.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|There is something wrong with the fact that the digital album on iTunes is $2 more than the actual CD.  WTH.  Bought the CD, and love it.  Wrong direction, Holes, Let her go...music to my ears, literally.
1449325947|5.0|CSS3 by David Sawyer McFarland is the one and only book that I would recommend everyone learning either CSS3 or CSS in general must absolutely read.  Although McFarland doesn't have the same in-depth approach to CSS3 that authors such as Peter Gasston demonstrate (Gasston's CSS3 book is exclusively about new CSS3 features), McFarland provides a breadth of general CSS instruction (with discussion on CSS3 features) in a conversational tone that none of the other books on CSS3 that I have read offer.<br /><br />Of particular note, McFarland's book has the best instruction on floating elements and positioning than in any of the other CSS or CSS3 books I have read.  After reading his chapter on positioning, I now have a firm understanding of absolute, relative, static, and fixed positioning--as well as knowledge of the underpinnings of the z-index property.<br /><br />Another delightful element in his book is his provision of a variety of solutions for managing widths for responsive design (which is useful for making sites work on not only desktops, but also mobile devices and ipads) in order to prevent float drop.  As the CSS3 box-sizing property is the ultimate fix, but doesn't work in older IE browsers, McFarland provides a fix-all for all browsers of embedding a div within a div, and giving the outer div a width and giving the inner div borders and padding (pp. 438-439, p. 447).  He provides another solution still, but the embedded div helps solve my particular need of ensuring that my web designs are compatible with all browsers.<br /><br />Yet another welcome surprise in McFarland's book is his discussion of responsive design techniques such as setting a max-width on divs and at the same time setting content divs to auto or 100% while removing floats for mobile media queries.  He also talks about how to use multicolumn floats in responsive design such that the content comes first (by floating the main content first within a floated div).  Additionally, he speaks ofmaking images fluid by making their max-width 100% (or a smaller percentage) of the container while removing height and width attributes from the actual image.  Furthermore, he provides tools, such as the Responsinator, for viewing an uploaded site in multiple browsers.<br /><br />He devotes an entire chapter to making the webpage look beautiful in print using media queries.  In the appendix of his book, he discusses some of these features, such as orphan, widow, and page break, and he discusses the browsers that support the various print-focused features.  Opera, by far, has the most support for stylizing a Web page for print purposes.<br /><br />Although CSS3 isn't the emphasis of McFarland's book, he discusses a variety of new features requiring vendor prefixes (which means that the style is repeated with each browser-specific prefix in order to be recognized by the respective browser).  For instance, McFarland talks about the following features requiring vendor prefixes: gradients (p. 435), keyframes (for animations) (p. 436), animation (p. 589), transitions (p. 592), transforms (p. 592), and many others.  (Animations and most, if not all, of these features don't work in Internet Explorer 8 or earlier.)<br /><br />McFarland also provides the HTML5 Shim (p. 24) so that Internet Explorer 8 and earlier understand the HTML5 tags.  Other CSS3 properties he talks about include the border-radius (p. 300), box-shadow (p. 399), transparency (p. 512), text shadow, and more.<br /><br />With that said, it might be beneficial for newcomers to CSS (or CSS3, for that matter) to consider delving into a simpler book, such as the HTML5 and CSS3 Visual Quickstart Guide.  (Although the aforementioned Quickstart Guide was not reviewed most favorably, it gives a simpler introduction to CSS3 than provided in McFarland's book.)  Once a beginner to CSS (or CSS3) has a basic foundation, then McFarland's book is indispensible.<br /><br />(For interest, I estimate that it took approximately 6 to 10 minutes to read a single page of McFarland's book.  Given that, it would take roughly between 60 to 100 hours to read the entire (approximately 600 page) book; in other words, at 3 hours of reading a day, the book can be completed within 20 to 33 days.  As a note for beginners, I would recommend reading at bare minimum two books and optimally four or more books on CSS3 to get a sense of mastery of the topic.)<br /><br />All in all, David Sawyer McFarland's book is the one book I would most recommend owning of all CSS or CSS3 books, especially for those with at least one prior book read on CSS or CSS3.  McFarland couldn't have done a better job of creating a leading edge book on CSS in general.
B0000669JL|4.0|This is a very good collection of Bob Marley's reggae music. A must for anyone who likes this type of ballad music.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Although there is a cast of hundreds this story is fascinating and keeps you reading and intrigued with twists and turns that you don't expect!!  I'm not sure what to compare it to but it's a really fantastic read.  (PS there are several more books that continue the story - I'm on book three).  Although it occurs in a place and time far far away, it has the flavor of our medieval era.
B000PUB9I2|5.0|Just love it. It has all theses old songs I grew up listening to and I was looking for and more!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You never want to put the book down!!! Such a great book mad intriguing story line!! I am starting the next book now!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game!  Easy to play and easy to earn acorns without having to by them.  A great game for people of all ages.
B0013UIUBC|4.0|I usually watch movies that are funny. This wasn't a comedy, but something about it caught my attention. I started watching this On Demand on tv and had to leave the house before it was even half way over. When i returned home it was not on anywhere. I wanted to see it so much that I went to Amazon and paid to see the rest of it. I was happy I did.
B000Y8G1K6|5.0|Glad I picked up this one on vinyl. Highly under rated. This collection is just as great as past Eagles albums. It would have gone #1 back in the day. Love it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is awesome! I love looking at other people's ideas and getting fresh ideas for my life :) also get to follow friends and share with them
B00C2VIA52|3.0|This is a great TCG, without the trading with other people part.  You don't have to pay a lot of money, or any of you're willing to work hard at getting the runes you need to buy the big guns you need to advance in the game.<br /><br />The only real problem is it takes a lot to really build up your arsenal, and the difficulty curve starts off easy enough for you to get the hang of the game then ratchets up pretty steeply.  That's how they get you to spend money on the cards which they charge a hefty price for (5 bucks for a pack of four, which they justify by saying one of those will be at least a rare OR epic card).  I'd rate it for stars of the boosters were a lot cheaper, but as is, it's still a pretty decent and fun game with a lot of depth.  Not bad for a freebie.
B008469DGY|5.0|Great amusement short term.  Excellent graphics for the price.<br />Kudos to the developer.  I'm not a game player so it is very<br />much worth the money.
B000050WZY|5.0|I've been out of vinyl for a while now. When CDs became easily available I just kind of forgot about my vinyl collection. And, up until recently, hadn't purchased much in a long time. Great to have this collection on vinyl to add to my collection. Sound great! Got it for about half the price I've seen it in stores. Love it!

B00CFA222M|5.0|I watched this film with my grandson and we both liked it a lot.  The special effects were very good and the film has a lot of action.  As I watched the film I was torn between whether this movie was for adults or children.  It seemed at times like the fairy tale and at other times with an adult twist to the film due to some of the violence.  It seemed a little dark and violent for children so I would not recommend it for very little children.<br /><br />The acting was well done and the actors in the film did an excellent job of portraying their roles.  The special effects were outstanding and the good acting made the film entertaining for all ages and ultimately I felt it was between a 4 and a 5 star family movie. (Remember it is a PG13 film so chose the audience appropriately.)

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has been so popular among my friends for a long time, and when I finally got around to reading it, I knew why.  I could not put it down.  It was intriguing from beginning to end.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Loved this book. Loved that I could get it on my kindle so easy and cheap. Great, easy, quick read.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Not a lot of content available. I don't have netflix and they haven't signed up anyone yet. I'd say don't expect ROKU performance or features. I'm hoping more becomes available before i throw it in a drawer and buy the new ROKU.

Mike writes well, has a great feel for being able to discuss difficult aural concepts in simple language, and the book is backed up by Mike's website [...] which is a most extraordinary resource. You just cannot go wrong with this book!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is super fun to play with family or friends. It is a little difficult to draw on the kindle, however.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|Love the corny old sci fi. Cheap props and bad acting makes for entertainment and all round good times. :-)
B00005T7I1|5.0|i watched this movie as a kid.  the classic comic character turned to a movie.  the action you remember.  2 thumbs up.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I enjoyed this book because I kept thinking about it even when I wasn't reading it.  There is just enough detail to keep you guessing but you still have to wait to the end to figure it out for sure.  There were such lush passages that I immediately bought a copy for my friend that loves words and books with literary themes.  Plenty of other reviews mention the plot, so no need to mention it here but I do think this book is definitely worth the time.

006621131X|5.0|Patti Smith is an amazingly beautiful person inside and out.  Her beautiful poetry and poignant songwriting style and her idyllic bohemian lifestyle is an inspiration to me and I'm sure lots of young women out there.  I've read this twice already and finally decided to buy my own copy to keep and cherish. Was pleasantly surprised at the expedient delivery and even more ecstatic that the hardcover copy (which was so hard to find) to be in perfect pristine condition. Seriously surprised since it was a used copy.  Highly recommend to anyone to order from this seller; very happy with my purchase!
B003B02OOG|4.0|Nice and quick....a collection of short stories that kind of catch you up on all of the gossip in the Town of Clanton. These could be the back stories of any of the minor characters  in Grisham's novels. All of these stories contain people that you have met in situations that are entirely plausible.<br />Highly Reccomend
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitare. It is one of my favorite past time games and I played it a lot growing up. This one has the look and feel of laying out the cards on your own. You have the option to change your card faces, backs, background, draw one or three at a time as well as right or left handed play. You can choose your deal to be random, winning, multiplayer, or replay the previous deal. You can either slide the cards where you want them or just tap and the cards will automatically go to the available space, for example the aces will go right into your build pile. Be careful with this though, because if there is more than one place for the card to go it may not be where you want it.There is an undo and hint button. The bottom also keeps track of your time, score and moves made.<br />I have been playing this on my Kindle Fire with no issues
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|My daughter started to read the Pretty Little Liars book series and was interested in the TV series.  We are hooked and are looking to buy the next season too!  Love watching episodes without all of the commercials!
082300659X|4.0|I was expecting that the dvd has much more examples of complete drawings, but instead of this, has interviews that for me was useless...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|saw movie previews but thought i'd read the book first. really liked the book so I'm passing on the movie even if brad;ey cooper is in  it!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|Author is definitely not a wordsmith. Plot is decent but writing leaves a lot to be desired. A very disappointing sequel.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Couldnt out it down! I read this book in 2 days and im on to the next! I would highly recomend readingthis book
B009OA57MI|4.0|Excellent app.<br />A lot of fun in one app.<br />Can use as stress free app<br />Need add more types of modern planes
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|This was billed as a youth novel but I missed that.  As a more mature reader, I thought it a bit simplistic, but still interesting and touching.  A feel good book in the end.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Terrible conclusion to trilogy. Worst written of the set. Plot is ok but the writing is horrible! I can't believe it made it past the editors!
B00A4FOWYQ|3.0|I think as an album, people will have one of three reactions to it. T&S hardcore personality fans will love it - of course they will love anything T&S does. T&S music fans will hate it - it's a complete departure to the indie rock/almost punk sound of their earlier albums - it sounds like it could be Katy Perry or La Roux (some songs it almost sounded like parts from La Roux). General music lovers will probably take it or leave it - pure pop - well done, but somewhat formulaic. Pop often is very temporal without lasteing appeal. I expect this album will be that way. It's definitely not Sainthood, or The Con.<br />  Musically, it's ok. Not bad, not great (As a musician who wishes he could write lyrics, it is very credible work - particularly a seventh album - I can't even finish one). There are several songs that are more notable, with a few filler songs. It is virtually all synth based with lots of samples - expecially vocal samples. The songs kind of mash together with little difference - if you're not paying attention, you may not realize the song changed. I guess the goal to to crank it loud at a club wherre the music isn't so important as a constant rhythmic beat. The biggest thing is the lack of emotion/feeling in the music. Don't get me wrong, there's some interesting lyrics, but the music is pretty tepid - you're not going to feel different after listening.<br />  Ultimately, I find myself in the third camp. I like T&S because of their music and sound. I bought it and will listen, but I don't see myself in the future pulling this one out when I have a desire to put on some T&S - that's going to be The Con.<br /> - Poore Richard
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|I can't stop reading these books! The story seems to come alive off the pages. So well written and a brilliant story. Off to download book number four!!!
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|I've never written a music review before but after listening to AM, I decided now was the time. It doesn't matter when you started listening to the Arctic Monkeys just know that you need to own this masterpiece. Not one filler on this album from front to back and you can tell the boys have perfected their craft. America just might actually pay attention this time around and it's about time!
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|The only reason I gave it 3 star was of the way it treat a woman who has very low morals.  Not a funny thing as there are many children now a days that would really like to know who their father was. But, because their mother had such low morals, they will never know.  That my friend is sad not funny
0375831002|5.0|Wonderful book if interesting reading about the Holocaust. Very interesting. Second book about this subject, the story teller is a great read with this.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It pretty much respects the book, except for a few details, but the story is still just as good as what Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a hundred years ago. Great action, great special effects, and more importantly, great story. The special effects support well the story and does not burry it, so I really enjoyed it. Taylor Kitch did a splendid job in this movie and I do hope that there will be a sequel someday because ERB's books rock!!! 5 stars all the way!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This showed up in the popular section of my library. It was an odd book, but the story line sucked me in.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|So I am a student in 8th grade and are school got macbook air's and I have this on it and phone its nice for notetaking
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a really fun game with a lot of very unique charscters.  It is a lot of fun to play!!!!!!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Special effects are very good and we enjoyed the story line also. One that will be watched more than once.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Love it, can wait until season 3. If you are thinking of getting it, you should. It has many deleted scenes that never made it to the show, blooper and many more.
386521584X|5.0|The book and its conditions are great. I though the book was a little bit larger than it actually is, but its ok. Anyways is a very good edition.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed the book and  will probably get the rest of the series.  The characters were good and the writing was good
B001NEK2GE|5.0|The option of a programmable keypad with a joy stick and ergonomic setup is ideal for many applications. I think advertising it as gaming hardware is really underselling the potential of this kind of hardware. I make my own music and use music editing software such as Music Creator heavily. This keypad allows me to program all my most needed functions and macros and keep them separate from my keyboard so they don't screw up my other computering needs.<br /><br />The option furthermore of programming multiple profiles and switching between them on the device itself allows for a great increase in convenience while switching between programs. The changing of a key from one command to another is drag and drop. Easy and fully customizable.<br /><br />A great buy for many applications, not just gaming.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Matthew McConaughey is brilliant is this movie. I seen it on TV a 2 months ago and I had to buy it for myself.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|These young people, especially Johnathan, put their souls into their music.  Heavens choir will sound much like this, I think!
B003NX76BM|5.0|I always enjoy Nora Robert's style.  I'm so glad she has deviated from the storyline of spirits haunting and guiding star crossed lovers.  This is so much more entertaining!
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I was looking for a chess app, this one suffices, computer is moderately difficult depending on what you set it to.
B00E3D7WGU|3.0|being a Madonna fan since i was 9 back in the 80's, i'm a little disappointed in the sound. I downloaded the mp3 just a little after midnight last night. I couldn't wait, but the sound is off. From what I understand, it's off on the BluRay version as well. When i watched the show on EPIX, I thought the sound was funny then as well. It seems like they just moved the audio over to mp3 without any enhancing. I have all her live music, and they are fabulous. There are times during this album, when i can't hardly hear the music over her voice and the fans. It does seem bootleg and i was wondering if i had downloaded something bad. but, i will listen to it, until and if they decide to redo, which I doubt they will lol. Still love her!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It the awesomeness thing in the world I play it everyday my mom love it and I play play and play
B0019IIPXQ|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie. I wasn't particularly a Vin Diesel fan so during the theatrical release I just blew it off<br />as another typical sci-fi run of the mill flick. I thought the same of Chronicles of Riddick as well. My conversion as I'm sure as others occurred recently when I decided to see Riddick currently, third installment and playing in the theaters now.Wow!. I'm a fan for real now. Vin is awesome and this franchise is awesome. Pitch Black Will not disappoint. I loved all te acting and actors. Great movie.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A song of fire and ice is amazing<br />The best books I've ever read can't wait for the next one
0375869026|5.0|I am an adult w/ no kids and I loved this book. I thought it was really sweet and moving. I felt so much for Augie in this book but I also felt so much for Via. Whenever I hear about a kid with disability or special needs, I always feel bad for that kids siblings bc you know the parents are not giving 100 percent to those other kids. So Via's section really spoke to me. I loved getting to read the other perspectives, and I am glad that they were all children perspectives. I gave it 4.5 stars bc I was a little bored towards the end (Augie's last section) and I also felt like the parents spoiled him a bit just bc he was different. I think they should have treated him just like they treated Via.  Still I can understand how they would want to spoil him. I recommend this to anyone and everyone but especially middle school children. Lets face it, middle school was the worst and if you were not being treated badly you were treating others badly. Books like this can help make a difference.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Once again, Keira Cass has amazed me. This book is awesome!! I could absolutely NOT put it down! More please!
B00EMJBVAI|4.0|I did not expect a zombie movie this good.  I took a chance and got rewarded.  So should you.<br /><br />Cons out of the way first.  Here's the thing: Pitt was the wrong guy to be cast as the lead, in my opinion.  Not because he is not CAPABLE, but because he failed to show any emotion in this flick.  Why?  I have no idea.  The movie provides a few truly frightening scenarios, yet Pitt has that blank stare on his face.  His character is witnessing things that really are thrillingly frightening!  You, the viewer, will be scared.  Pitt?  Blank too-much-Xanax stare.  Someone needs to remind him to PRETEND.  They call it ACTING, Brad.  Remember how excellent you were in Interview with the Vampire???  Fight Club?  Troy?  What happened?<br /><br />The only other con is the family.  They were boring, but they serve as leverage to get his character to act on behalf of humanity.  As with my first complaint, Pitt does not act like a father who is about to lose his children.  A few times he almost loses them, but no tears, no anxiety, no freaking out, no rage?  What the heck is that all about?<br /><br />Other than that, the movie was fun.  The gore level is low, but surprisingly it has no effect.  There's blood.  The undead are insanely vicious.  They act out in ways you have not seen before.  I promise.  The zombies are scary.  Plain and simple.  The trailers did not do them justice.  The CGI is only a part of the experience.<br /><br />The way Pitt's character has to overcome the threat to humanity by observing his encounters with the &#34;Zekes&#34; and putting the puzzle together is inventive.  The setbacks he encounters all involve zombies, and they all are nail-biters.  He has to piece clues to the origin together.  In the process, he discovers a tactical biological advantage over the zombies that is sickening, scary to use, and quite novel.<br /><br />This movie does EXACTLY what a zombie movie is supposed to.  It puts mankind on a hopeless path.  Zombies are everywhere.  Nowhere is safe for long.  Everywhere he goes, zombies are a serious danger.  Every thing he has to achieve--zombies are in the way.  The pacing is like a roller coaster ride: a slow, thoughtful rise to a drop during which characters contemplate and plan and converse, then a swift drop into hellish scenes during which plans go wrong, fail, and things turn WORSE.  Then repeat.<br /><br />In fact, the tale is far from over.  The world is far from safe.  The movie deserves a sequel.  Maybe with a few more committed actors taking the lead.e.

140006922X|5.0|I thought the author portrays a very fair and scholarly interpretation of Jesus of Nazareth based on the historical materials available.  It tries to make sense of all the sharp contradictions in the Bible and kindly explains his interpretation based on historical facts gathered.  Excellent book!  It presents a different yet very reasonable and fair assessment of Jesus's \\"Kingdom of God\\" and the origin of Christianity.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Fun action movie.  Lot of comedy interspersed with the action.  Would have liked to see more of the suit, that's Iron Man
B0000714BP|5.0|Have had it on VHS forever and wanted to upgrade. It was used, but plays just fine. Don't expect any fancy options on the DVD, but it's an old movie.
B008E374PO|5.0|When I first bought this, I had no idea that Adam collaborated on it, so o honestly couldn't tell a difference. But when I did, I wasn't disappointed because the album had already grown on me.and I honestly like the direction  this album went in.<br /><br />Dreams and Disasters: great song to jump up and down to, still with meaningful lyrics<br /><br />Shooting Star: peppy and upbeat, but I like the acoustic better<br /><br />Gold: great beat and love the GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLD. Great pick up line, man. I like that it has  a little deeper meaning. I love the acoustic<br /><br />Dementia ft. Mark Hoppus: one of my faves with more Owl City like lyrics, love the hard rock feel of the song<br /><br />I'm Coming After You: BEST LOVE SONG EVER LOL<br /><br />Speed of Love: love the dupsteppy feel and more techno than the others<br /><br />Good Time ft Carly Rae Jepsen: not much to say about this one, but I'm glad it has nothing about sex<br /><br />Embers: love this song! Love the meaningful lyrics, love the meaning, love the sad, yet rock feel. Love the guitars<br /><br />Silhouette: a sweet, piano and synth ballad where AY's vocals shine though. I've cried many a time to this song<br /><br />Metropolis: love the strings on this song and the lyrics, they're like dementia's and I like the softer sound and the layers to the music<br /><br />Take It All Away: love it love it love it. Best breakup song ever and its not to cheesy and I am in love with the drums on this song<br /><br />overview: overall, good album. Not the best, but still lovable. faves: Dreams and Disasters, Dementia, I'm Coming After You, Speed of Love, Embers, Metropolis, and Take It All Away. Oh heck just buy the whole album!!!
B00C49GQD0|5.0|Original. Fun. Captivating! Tatiana has got a gem of a part and she rolls. Awesome Sci-Fi based concept for both male and female audiences filmed with a good eye for creative originality.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Love seeing all the inside references to the TV show and movies.  The story was gripping but the end was a little drawn out.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|First of all, I love mindless action films;  I have no problem with saying that.  Second, I thought the first GI Joe movie was barely watchable, but I survived.  Third, I thought that with how lousy the first GI Joe was, that they would have somehow improved on that dud with the sequel.  Man was I completely off on that one;  this movie is a total bust.  The acting, the story (whatever it's about), the entire thing is just a complete bust.  It really begs the question, why in the world did these mainstream actors agree to do this dud; it's a complete embarrassment.  Please save your time and money.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I'll watch this one again, really enjoyed it. Logan Lerman plays his part exceptionally well, I'm going to find more movies he's in and order them!!
0345525558|4.0|4.5 stars!  This is a wonderful book!  Diffenbaugh takes what could have been a terribly sad and tragic story and redefines the lives of the characters with flowers.  The flowers change everything!  I will never mindlessly choose a bouquet of flowers because of how they look.  I will consult Victoria's dictionary to choose flowers based on how I feel or what I'm trying to say.  Hopefully, I will never give or receive yellow roses again!  You'll have to read this great book to understand why.  Highly recommended!  I will read this author again.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Just finished.  Can't wait to start book four and the start of the new season on television.  Rumor is there will a book six and seven from Martin.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does what it's suppose to do without fail!! Haven't missed an appointment or gotten the hubby up in time for his appointments. Very satisfied.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|love this soundtrack! Me and one of my friends almost wore it out on our road trip, and even my husband sings along with it
B00COWOXGE|5.0|THE FUGITIVE, still one hell of a ride after 20 years! Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones were at their best! Good script, tight directions, and no CG!<br /><br />I got this movie in VHS, laser disc, DVD, and glad that I was patience enough to wait for this remastered Blu-ray! It was well worth it! Picture quality at it best with DTS-HD Master audio sound! Last Blu-ray released only featured Dolby DIgital 5.1 soundtrack.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Written on the premise that witches, vampires and demons do exist although in secret this book is the first in a trilogy. Not a fan of the Twilight Saga, I found A Discovery of Witches to be well written, intelligent. Simply a good read.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|I have watched the first, and now this....and wonder why I did that on both occasions.  This one has me really scratching my head.  First and foremost, Stallone just looks like a goombah, talks like one and should retire from movies altogether.  As for the story, such as it is, you can see everything that's going to happen a mile away.  Not going to give you a spoiler alert, since the movie spoils itself.<br /><br />The kid \\"Billy\\".....no pun...getting himself caught was totally expected.  Then, as throughout the movie, the main cast does exactly what they shouldn't in the situations they get into....and thus continues the movie instead of ending right then.  Example one....Billy gets caught...bad guys threaten to kill him unless the guys put down their weapons....(here comes \\"DERRRPPPP\\" moment #1)...they did...and they killed the kid anyway.  Wow...not like we didn't fully expect THAT to happen. Lesson...shoot the bad guys when you have the chance...they will never not kill the hostage.<br /><br />In a scene where they're running out of room and Stallone is yelling \\"CLIMB...CLIMB\\" in a rickety airplane....of course they just climb out of danger at the last possible second...or that would be the end of the movie...and what probably would happen in any other circumstance or real life.  Later, as our enemies pull into the CGI cave having crossed a bridge I swear they used in STRIPES...our heroes crash an airplane into said CGI cave, for which they have no idea how deep it is, and manage not to completely obliterate the plane itself....fuel doesn't explode...the plane doesn't fall apart completely like any airplane crash in history.  A bit way too past suspension of disbelief for me.  Later....too much later...when Stallone confronts the cliche enemy with the funky accent, he is challenged to fight \\"like a man\\" and does the movie-obligatory thing and drops all his weapons instead of just shooting the enemy like he should have...or you and I would have...or anyone with half a brain would have...so we can see how a man fights, I guess....and stabs the bad guy with the same knife we saw that killed Billy the Kid earlier in the movie after seeming to be about to lose....so as to be somehow poetic justice.<br /><br />This movie was just roiling in cliches and bad one-liners (I'll be back...Yippee Ki-Yay and many more).  I am dumber for having watched this.half a brain would have...so we can see how a man fights, I guess....and stabs the bad guy with the same knife we saw that killed Billy the Kid earlier in the movie after seeming to be about to lose....so as to be somehow poetic justice.<br /><br />This movie was just roiling in cliches and bad one-liners (I'll be back...Yippee Ki-Yay and many more).

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|great movie, me and my husband have watched together, me and my nieces watch it together, this is a dvd that we'll wear out and buy again
B00BWJARHO|1.0|W.O.W I fell asleep on this movie so many times.  It was just boring and stupid too me.  I hate to use the word stupid but I just couldn't get into it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's a great show. Enjoyable to watch. The costuming is fun to see. Love it. Can't wait for season 4!
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|It is what it is. This sweet book examines childhood memories (the ones that change and the ones that disappear). And it does it beautifully.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|have watched this one over and over, will probably wear it out and have to buy another copy of it. Anna Kendrick is a much better actress than they let her be in the Twilight series
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great case,well made and provides protection. Would buy again. Folding feature works as described and provides a good viewing angle.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Amazing is all I have to say, so rich, a classic had me on the edge of my chair! A must read for those in need of a good vampire story!
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I think its really got some great ideas. Like take a scratch pad with you every where you go. Doodle, etc...
B009LDD1X0|4.0|We were definitely excited to get our pre-ordered BBT season 6, since we don't watch the shows on cable (and we've been waiting to get this since we watched season 5 on DVD. Lo and behold when we went to put in the second DVD, it was labeled disc 1 and indeed was a disc 1 DVD (not a mislabeled disc 2).<br /><br />Sad to say this is a disappointing experience and the one star is for the experience with receiving a defective product, not the show itself.<br /><br />EDIT: Amazon replaced this for me promptly, but it was still disappointing not being able to watch it the day it came out when I pre-ordered it for this purpose.
B002GMSMHS|5.0|I AM PREPARING FOR MY TRIP ABROAD ONLY TO REALIZE MY NEED FOR A MEMORY CARD. I SHOPPED ALL THE RETAIL STORES (SMALL TOWN) ONLY TO BE TOLD THIS ITEM WAS NOT AVAILABLE ANY LONGER. THANKS AMAZON FOR MAKING MY TRIP COMPLETE.<br /><br />JESSICA
0060839872|5.0|i read this book years ago and now with some experience and age behind me i wanted to see if it had the same impact.  i liked the note from pirsig at the beginning of the book that gives an answer to a question i've had for years.  great book.
B006S01GH2|1.0|Great movie, but the streaming version of this is not in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It is cropped to fit a 16x9 TV.  I was excited to see this in HD for the first time, but upon starting the streaming and noticing the cropping, I stopped it, and watched the DVD with its original aspect ratio.  Why would I want to watch this movie with the sides of the image cut off?
B000W93CXQ|5.0|This book is amazingly written and incredibly sad. It makes you think about all the students who slip through cracks at school. Makes you think if you've ever been like this.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I did not want to lug a heavy sharpening stone or kit around with me while exploring the outdoors so I gave this gadget a go. It kept the edge on my knives sharp. I really liked the serrated edge sharpener. Excellent buy.
B006FE83UE|5.0|i like everything about this edition of the film; all the interviews and of course the movie itself.  in good condition and rec'd in a timely manner.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Be careful! You will get hooked on this series. It is refreshing to watch the characters in these two little towns in the early 1900s as they live and work side by side. I enjoy watching the characters as they are developed. You will, too!
B00005JOA0|4.0|The storyline is unusual, the love story even more so - in fact it was hard to imagine given the circumstances and the characters.  But it is definitely worth a look.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I always new Shirley Maclaine was Weird!!! Shame on her for being such a Sucky MOTHER!!! I believe everything her daughter wrote!!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I was having fun with this game on my Kindle Fire HD until I decided to purchase some coins. Although I received a confirmation from Amazon my coins were not credited to my account. After a very helpful on-line chat with Amazon I was given a refund. Be careful about purchasing coins from this app; but if you do and do not get them, Amazon will credit your account. So one star for the app, five stars for Amazon customer service!
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it never slowed down very much.  I really liked the way the writing flowed then came together when it was time.  It was also a very different kind of story. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It has action, awesomeness, super hero I love this movie the special affects are awesome I give it two thumbs up 👍👍
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|It works great on my kindle fire HD. I love it! I had it on my phone but having out on the kindle fire is better because it's a bigger screen. I had to have the pro version :) good game to kill time :) just have fun!
B00BD6KPFU|4.0|I find this quite addicting, not too serious as &#34;The Goodwife&#34; and &#34;Damages&#34;, and with lots of stunning and hilarious dialogues, esp with the character of Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), Oh LOVE HIM.....Rick's so witty in his root to play a classic foolish wit and he totally pulls it off, not to mention his amazingly BIG smile and run-on sentences further help to sharpen his character.  I believe Rick contributes a large portion of the fun part to this drama, he should win some Supporting Actor in some TV Awards in my opinion!!<br /><br />Others characters are great too.....Harvey is as always - cool and cute, and Donna (Sarah Rafferty), as smart as she can be, this is the first time i  ever saw Sarah in TV series and i started to like her.<br /><br />So if you're looking for some casual and fun legal drama to watch for leisure without burning your brain out this is one for you:))
B0084U0IEG|3.0|The first four chapters seemed horrible. How could this juvenile drivel have been written by an author with the accomplishments of Ian McEwan? The characters were uninteresting. The plot was boring. I almost gave up, but continued because I take seriously my responsibility to be prepared for book group discussions. The rest of the book was much more engaging. The ending seemed to be a bit too convenient, but did pull elements of the story together.

B000BT97AO|5.0|(First, sorry Amazon but I was given this film as a gift.)<br />This little film was quite simply visually stunning and absolutely brilliant from start to finish. The story was absorbing and I'm utterly in awe of the wonderfully creative and admirably twisted mind that came up with some of the creatures in this film. It was well acted and very engrossing. Jim Henson studios should be proud.

B00F35BV64|5.0|Awesome! The franchise is restored to its original glory; updated for the times but true to the creation. Characters are excellent. Can't wait for the next installment, but, until then, I think I'll watch this one again.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I was asked repeatedly to review this mouse by Anker through emails right off the bat. I wanted to give time to this mouse to see how well it worked before I reviewed it. It has now been 2 months so here's my review Anker.<br /><br />PROS:<br />I love the look of this mouse, it's beautiful and it fits in my hand nicely. It's hard for me to find a mouse that fits in my hand and is of a decent price. I compared this mouse to various mice and found that this one had it all for only 40 dollars. You can change the color of the Anker symbol and the pulse/no pulse choices. It has 8 usable buttons unless you include scrolling. The chord is a nice and strong material. I have had no problems with it as of today.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Some of the colors you can change to don't look like the color picked. I picked color 5, light orange, and it comes out pink. 6 is an even lighter pink. 8-10 are white(light greens) and 11 is a very very faint green almost white. 12 and 13 are blue(Dark greens). The color you choose, unless it's ROYGBIV, is not the color you pick. I play COD2 so I like cooking my grenades. I expected to be able to cook them by making one of these buttons on the mouse my grenade but it just tosses them out with no cook. I guess it's a simple click. I got the same result when trying to bind my TS button on this mouse. It clicks once and I can't talk. The only button that works for talking is the scroll button and that is highly inconvenient. It would be great if they could fix this issue. I want to be able to cook grenades!<br /><br />Overall, it's a good mouse. Maybe I just got a defective mouse with bad colors but if that's my only issue...then this mouse is a great mouse! I just hope they can fix the buttons since that was my main reason to buying a mouse with &#34;9&#34; buttons. I want to be able to cook grenades while running!
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|WoW! have to see it to believe it... Madonna Epic fail with MDNA Work Tour Blu-ray. main menu don't work,DTS-5.1 only work center and left Speakers only NO BASS and Picture quality what can I say my Iphone take better video.<br /><br />all the bad review they are right. AMAZON needs to STOP selling the blu-ray until they get new issues that aren't defective. video and audio is really bad.no 5.1 no bass no good at all i'm send it my back...
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Video is supposed to have that \\"movie effect\\" nothing wrong with the video. The audio though is missing channels. Blu is defective. Hopefully they will do a replacement program, and deal with this issue. Such a shame to have one of her best tours less than perfect. :(
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of those stories that's hard to put down. Well written plus great characters kept me interested from start to finish.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Seems like this was going to be a great product, but during the Chromecast setup I was told I needed to enable UPnP protocol on my router, yet ...<br /><br />I just read an zdnet article from earlier this year that said that \\"the US Department of Homeland Security is urging everyone to disable the common networking Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol. This is being done because Rapid7 security researchers have found that tens of million devices worldwide are wide open to attack because of flaws in the network protocol and its implementations.\\" [...]<br /><br />My two smart TVs and my two Roku's do not require the enabling of UPnP. Is there a basic flaw in the Chromecast that it requires us to enable UPnP?<br /><br />Should I enable this on my router and take this chance just to use Chromecast? Could use some advice here.

B001LF4IA6|5.0|It must be hard to be Bruce Springsteen. You have tons of talent that virtually oozes through your pores, and your fans, the very people who love your work, are your harshest critics when you produce great work.<br /><br />Musicians, like any artists, grow and change. Their views and angst from age 22 would be misplaced in a 50+ year old. If you haven't grown and changed over the years, people would complain about that. Yet at the same time they won't let an artist progress because....the complainers seem to understand better what his songs should be, I guess.<br /><br />The first time I ever heard Outlaw Pete (track 1) was in Clarence's last tour and EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE except me knew the song. Even on first listen, it's infectious and arousing. It fits perfectly into the volumes of stories Bruce tells in his music.<br /><br />For me, the volume evokes a great feel of the E Street Band that harkens back to the early 70s. There's no doubt that this is an E Street involved record. I'll admit that makes me happy. That doesn't mean the band and music haven't evolved since then, but you can hear it, you can feel the roots. I love that. This is the music that Bruce and associates make in 2009 and I can't understand why anyone would complain about it. Every track is highly listenable.<br /><br />Folks, if you want Born To Run, go pull a copy of that CD from your collection. It's already been recorded. This stands on it's own and stands tall and proud. It's another gift from Bruce and I for one am glad to have it.

B001N3OJEG|5.0|Top 10 in the best films of all time. One word... Rolo Tomassi! Mysterious, corrupt, funny, thought provoking, old holly wood. The best film depiction of old classic 50's hollywood and the relationship between the studio execs, the actors and the L.A police. If you want an in-depth look into how Hollywood was created watch this movie. LOVE IT!
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|I've been a fan of Guy Clark since the beginning, having bought \\"Old No. 1\\" after seeing him perform on Austin City Limits back in the mid-1970s. There have been maybe two or three albums along the way that didn't knock me out, but for the most part Guy Clark has delivered quality album after quality album, some of them qualifying as true gems. This newest album is one of the gems. Guy Clark may be \\"getting up there\\" in age, but his songs are no less potent or memorable. In fact, I really think this album ranks as one of his strongest yet.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the songs on \\"My Favorite Picture of You\\" deal with love and loss, friends and family, life and all of its abundant heartbreak and joy. The powerful and thoughtful lyrics give added weight to the songs, but don't go thinking this is a total \\"downer\\" of an album, because that's not the case at all. These tunes ramble and roll, simmer and stir, inspire and delight. You might shed a tear or two, but you'll also be smiling and laughing. If you are a Guy Clark fan, this one should be a no-brainer. Its' a must listen from a master songsmith.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was a very interesting book but I had a hard time understanding for whom the target audience was intended. At first I was sure it was for kids and young adults but the use of bad language, while not overpowering , was interlaced enough throughout the book to question the appropriateness for young readers. There were a couple of racial epithets that didn't need to be included for the story's continuity. Violence is also a running theme but like the children characters in the Hunger Games, the children have a lack of power and control over their fate. Ender's humanity shines through despite what he is forced to do to survive, though there are other characters,reminiscent of Lord of the Flies and Hunger Games, who embrace the violence with little or no remorse.<br />Any parent thinking of letting their kid read this book, should read the book first, then decide if their kid is mature enough to understand the morals of the story and would be able to have an open dialogue with their parents regarding the use of violence in the story to drive home questions of morality that can be applied in life. I hesitate to put a recommended age and instead leave the decision for individual parents to make after reading the book themselves.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I use this for school cases and other texts and it make reading so easy and uncomplicated.  I can highlight, underline, add comments and they are all easy to access.  Going through my files is easy too.

B0095VPBFY|3.0|This one seems to drag/freeze when watching movies. That is important to me as I read some of the reviews that were saying it was great for HTCP. My \\"D\\" was better in that respect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i will reccomend this it is a great game you should try it setember 11 2013 please try it its great
B007SYWFRM|4.0|a fun game that both myself and my daughter enjoy playing together or by ourselves. fun for the family for sure.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This is an early Bosch, one without Pike.  Harry solves a series of complicated, drug-related, cop-related murders involving a ring in Hollywood and Mexican border towns.  The plot is complex but not overly so. All the pieces fall into place, no lose ends are left.  The parallels between Harry and one of the main characters Cal Moore are very interesting.  I can't recommend this highly enough!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good. Many translations. Easy to use. Good bookmark and search functions.<br />I would highly recommend this free downloadable Bible
B00COCY67A|2.0|Was expecting more music. Too much chatter!  Too many repeat tracks. Discription should have shown that this included all of the recording session monkey business.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|The Conjuring is absolutely terrifying. Once you turn it on, but be prepared to watch this movie and be in for the long haul. Strap yourself in hold on for the ride because the scenes are long and intense with no let up. There is no comic relief in this film, no light hearted banter, and each scene plays like it is the final scene and believe me, you will wish it were as it is truly frightening. Supposedly based on the true story of an exorcist, the movie opens in the middle of a scene that is intense, and then follows a family that moves into a haunted house. The scene with the mother closing her eyes to play a game with her daughter will be a classic in horror movies for years to come, with few writers being able to compare to with what the director cooked up. This movie will play on every fear you had growing up (what is under the bed, is someone in the closet, what if I get locked in the basement and the lights don't work, etc.). Highly recommended!!
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I thought it would go on a little more smoothly. It didn't work on my iPad mini. I returned it.

B00422LESO|5.0|Great mix of humor and romance.  Hale knows how to spin a good tale.  On to Midnight in Austenland next.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|If you liked movies like \\"Horrible Bosses\\", the first \\"Hangover\\" and \\"Superbad\\" then you will love this film. If you didn't see any of those, this one is even better. The movie is about a small time drug dealer who hires a motley crew to pose as his family so he can smuggle drugs across the Mexican border. Jason Sudeikis is perfectly cast as the dealer, Jennifer Aniston is beautiful and hilarious as his stripper wife, and Emma Roberts and Will Pouter are excellent and their chemistry is great as they play the parts of the perfect American middle class family. Sudeikas will be highly missed from SNL, his delivery is always perfect. No slapstick comedy, We Are The Millers is just plain funny, with some of the funniest one liners in any movie, especially between Aniston and Sudeikis. Includes great bloopers during the credits.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. Mitch Albom never fails to make books that I can't seem to stop reading once I start. Just fabulous.

B0025UHKNS|2.0|This watch will eventually die.  That is a fact and you can research it on Google and on YouTube.  It is a flaw in the battery.  Thousands of owners of the 405CX have at one point or another run into the issue where the battery will no longer accept a charge or will say that it is charged when it is not.  Bottom line, the battery will die anywhere between 6 months and two years after purchase.  For me, it was about two years.  For the amount I spent on this watch...$350 when it was brand new...I expect it to last a lot longer.  Warranty only runs for one year, so if you run into this issue after one year, you will have to pay for the replacement of the battery which I'm told is over $100.  I don't know what else to tell you expect that during the two years that it worked, my 405CX was awesome.  It did everything I wanted it to and it had good reception..both with GPS and with the HRM accessory.  But now it is a useless hunk of junk.<br /><br />My recommendation is to NOT purchase this watch.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Bawled my eyes out. I never cry during a book. It was so sweet if a slightly predictable to begin with I didn't see how it would all pan out in the end at all...
1400069289|5.0|First off, if you are wondering if you should read this book and want to read the reviews....READ IT!!! It is such a great book.<br /><br />This book is so amazing, I have already read it twice!<br /><br />This book covers everything! It really opens your eyes to great personal and business goals and how to reach them.<br /><br />It is very exciting to learn how businesses operate and by making such a minor change can have such a huge and successful impact!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I read tons of novels. My favorites are Classics like David Copperfield but I also like newer supernatural thrillers like The Bone Season or books like The Hunger Games. This book, however, i hated. Aside from the main character, you jump from person to person every chapter, never really revisiting their storyline and just continue to move forward. I didnt see the connections of the book, or how it all tied together and it just seemed like a bunch of random stories put in one book. I know other people loved it, but i like a good narrative. This doesnt have one.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Already played many hours and plan to play many more. Looking forward to more excellent games from Gameloft. On the &quot;freemium&quot; issue: I think it was handled better than it often is. It's certainly possible to play and do well without paying anything.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was strange. I thought it was definitely predictable, it was obvious what was going to happen from page one. I am a sucker for a love story no matter how predictable or corny, but this went from sweet to weird to slightly disturbing. At first I was all about them being together and was waiting and rooting for it to happen and then when It did she decided it wasn't right for reasons I didn't quite grasp they seemed stupid to me. Then he became crazy and that's about where the book went down hill for me, he was not like cute and protective, more like crazy obsessive, I was like whoa dude calm yourself... then when she got on board with the crazy I was like Really?? I might read it again just to see if he really was as crazy as I perceived him to be the first go around...
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Before I purchased this kindle fire cover, I read the reviews. Some of the reviews weren’t so good. But since I was looking for something just to protect my kindle, I ordered it.  And this fits my needs. I'm happy with my purchase. I would recommend it if you’re just looking for something to protect your device.  I don’t use the book stand, so I can’t comment on that feature.  But all in all I’m happy with my purchase. Glad I ordered it. The price was great compared to some I looked at.
B0039TAHMA|3.0|Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is interesting but too long. It is way to drawn out. I had to keep myself from sleeping.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Although I'm not a fan of boxing/UFC, this had some good fighting scenes, nothing too gory.  It was about more than just fighting with the dynamic story of the relationship between Nick Nolte and his sons.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Unable to put this book down.  Read it in one day. Old school and love happy endings.  Looking forward to more of the same.  Will re-read again.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|After a few listens, I think that the new Arctic Monkeys is very, very good.  My wife digs it, too.  I've been a fan since the first album and have liked all of their records very much, considering each to have substantial differences of approach.  The current changes seem to simplify a lot of things, which can have its ups and its downs.  If you don't go into listening expecting the album to do the same things for you as other of their albums, then you'll be better off.<br /><br />Personally, \\"Suck it and See\\" is still my favorite Arctic Monkeys' record.  It's got a lot of great songs and some diversity of approaches.  The new album has less \\"songs\\" and more \\"moods,\\" I guess.  The lyrics are still pretty sharp, but with less depth and range than on the last record.  Most of the album draws on pulls towards love and/or sexual desire, but then that's always been fertile ground for rock and pop, and Alex pens and delivers his lyrics very adeptly, avoiding the pitfalls that can often sap the life out of such material.<br /><br />I totally dig it.  It's better for listening to while hanging out, partying or chilling without committing to \\"close\\" listening as much... but it is often infectious.<br /><br />On the whole, the fact that these guys are still so young, have weathered such attention from the start and continue to make album after album of quality material, avoiding outside pressures of what anyone else thinks they \\"should\\" sound like... and that they keep managing to build momentum and excitement, is phenomenal.  Lots to love.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|In short, this is a great rock album - the first half in particular is fantastic.  The Arctic Monkeys have slowed the tempo a little.  There is more groove and more space than on prior efforts.  The top notch songwriting is still there, with great lyrics and tunes, as you'd expect.  If you are uncertain, then just listen to the first two songs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game, it keeps you busy trying to find the items to escape. I like piecing together the puzzle. I definitely recommend playing it !!

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game you should buy it because you can make houseses and it is the coolist game in the world.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Not very many features. Disappointing that I can't look at hourly forecast for other days. Would like it to be a bit more interactive
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show! Lots of suspense, wit, well thought out plots and exceptional filming. A true modern day Sherlock adaption worth watching.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Enjoyed the lavish spectacle, music, and over-the-top partying at the beginning but it went down hill as the story evolved into contrived personal relationships. No wonder it was a box office disappointment.
B0006TSSNG|5.0|A must for any war movie buff and patriot! You think it was the early 40's at a time when we never knew this would be the greatest generation, we could use that feeling once again.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Loved it! This was an awesome continuation of Clare's work & it makes me look forward to more of this story.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Awesome!  I recommend it for the options and ease of use.  But I don't like the fact that I have to use so many words in a review!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I can't believe I never heard of this guy.  What an amazing story.  The music got stuck in my head.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|As others have stated, the 5.1 mix on the blu-ray is defective. Only 3 of the 5 speakers have sound coming out of them (no sound in the front right and rear right) which leaves the vocals and instruments sounding like you're listening to the show from outside an empty warehouse. Vocals are so faded in certain sections that it's hard to even hear if anything is being sung. Instruments appear and disappear in songs (such as Revolver) where you just get a drowned out sound of crowd noise. I have no idea how Universal allowed these discs to be shipped out in the defective state that they're in, but if sound is important to you, then save yourself the time and money and don't purchase this. If you have a defective disc, email Amazon as well as Universal and Live Nation and let them know about the issue so that they can start an exchange program. Your voice will not be heard by just bad reviews, so if you want a corrected disc, do your homework and let everyone know about the problem.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a fun game it is a little like subway  suffers but more fun a lot of it shows what might be in despicable  me 3 like the girl boss  in the street. But all in all it is a great game
B000002J29|5.0|I already had this album, but it is in vinyl.  I love Genesis and the album Seconds Out very, very much. Seconds Out is a live concert CD and one of the first live concerts of Genesis after Peter Gabriel left. They had already recorded 2 albums after he left. Genesis was voted the best live band one year. I just recently found that out. I wish I could turn back the time so I can be able to see them in a concert such as this one.

B002HFJ77S|5.0|The outrageousness of both twenties girls made me fall in love with them, and the true love and admiration that grows between the women is as heartwarming as the boy meets girl romance that slowly builds in only the way that Kinsella can do.  It's the journey that I always love to take and in this book, I laughed out loud, acted out the scenes for my family causing mirth to spread, and cried and cried with and for the characters.  This one caught me up, made me feel and will be one to remember.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It a very nice cover to protect my Kindle. Also you can set it up next to you and watch/read without having to hold it. Like it a lot.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|buyer beware!!!!! poor video , grainy , poor sound. not worth it  . it's a crap crap crap. skip this one, believe me. just save your money for something else.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|Really enjoyable read! Couldn't put it down between chapters, the suspense kept me going. A shame the movie changed so many details of the book! Can't wait for the next lot of movies though, onto book nr 5 already!
0812993845|1.0|Ever seen a movie, where you can't believe the lead characters are so silly?  Or they get themselves into situations which are so ludicrous, they defy belief?<br /><br />That sums up the plot of this book.  Characters making choices which are just plain stupid, and then if that's not bad enough, the carry-on capers that follow, make you lose any sympathy for them.  The characters of sister, Lottie and Fliss start off likeable, but by the end of the story, you just want it all to be over.<br /><br />Now, Sophie Kinsella is one author who I generally always enjoy reading.  But this book did not equal an enjoyable read.  One of the main storylines is Fliss arranging hotel staff to stop the consummation of the marriage - this plot went for chapters!  It wasn't enjoyable nor funny, just infuriating to read.<br /><br />Very disappointed in this storyline, and feel I cannot recommend to anyone.
B004T0E2S8|1.0|first off i am happy my favorites on my iphone transfered over. but i cant figure out how to add something to my favorites on the kindle version. what REALLY ticks me off is that there is no tab pro on this app. sorry but i was expecting more. one star and hopefully you get te features i want to make it 5 before i forget about this review.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|As I sit here in front of my mean machine looking down at my fingers wondering what to type, I know I want to give a review that is fair but doesn't give the story away.My subconcious, however, is screaming behind my frontal lobe to tell all and let those who have not read the book yet know what their getting into. Then my inner goddess perks up her head and gives me that look that says, let them read it,,, let them be surprised like you were. So I will say, if you like reading about sex... allot of sex then this is the book for you.<br />It's a little repetitious .... ok  allot repetitious but you have to remember Ana is not as experienced as some others.
1400052181|5.0|I could not put this book down. Wow - still speechless. This book is extremely powerful and NEEDS to be read.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Different and fun yet informative as well. The characters are well developed and interesting and the story moves on at a good pace keeping you interested until the end.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I heard  great things about the artist,so I wanted to get her CD as soon as possible, and Amazon made my day because I received this CD in 4 days. Every song on this CD is a keeper. She teamed up with amazing song writers and produces. Young artist with a truly soulful beat. Highly recommend!!!!!!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|It was slow to me...preview seemed better than the actual movie .  Disappointed, I really like bradley cooper so I give it 3 stars because I like him
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Love every song on this album. You Rock Vince Gill. Usuallly only like one or two songs on an album but this one rocks
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Their own sound is good and their venture into country-western sound gets the Hootie treatment with good results. Let's Dance, people.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|Huge swathes of content are locked up unless you are willing to pay $10 once you get the game.  It's nice for what it is, a smooth interface, but it is a ten-dollar app unless you want to do the same boring thing over and over and over.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|love it just wish I could figure how to play with a friend on this version. other then that great game.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|First off, LOVE the show!  Always kept me guessing.  The first time I added up the numbers printed on the hatch it blew my mind!  I got this box-set a couple of years ago, and recently rewatched the entire series for a third time (not counting the original TV viewing).  Long story short, I &#34;found&#34; a disc that at first wasn't there?!?!  It is unlisted in the product description, or at least wasn't when I bought it.  It is a BONUS disc that I believe is exclusive to this set!  I won't ruin it by telling you where to find it, but I will give a clue.  Sometimes...there is more in a diary than just the &#34;map&#34; (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade reference).  Good hunting, friends! :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is absolute the most awesome game out there it has nothing g but positive reviews its great great
B0021L8V0M|4.0|I bought this after seeing a rerun of this movie on cable and forgot how much I liked it.  Full fledged action. some a little unbelievable but they pull it off, look forward to the sequel.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I've played all three of these games (Flow, Journey, and Flower) and I've just fallen in love with all of them!!<br /><br />Now just a few things to keep in mind. These sorts of games I feel aren't for everyone. I for one, am not a give fan of FPS (I prefer RPGs and stuff of that nature so Journey was right up my alley). I also don't like fighting scary creatures (horror games are soooo not my preference because I would rather have puzzles and strategy over heart palpitations and creepy monsters any day.<br /><br />So just a quick review of each since if you're contemplating buying the games, you probably have a decent idea of what the games are about.<br /><br />Flow - Simple and more like a minigame but beautiful and breathtaking in its own way. I ended up playing with a friend and didn't notice time flying by until after we had beaten the entire thing. Quick, easy, clean, and simple fun.<br /><br />Journey - Beautiful with great character designs. The sand physics (if you're an environment junkie like me) had me in awe the entire game. Each time I play I finish an entire journey without a single pause. Fun, beautiful, and something that I will continue to play and play again for a very long time. (It's also an excellent game to show people who generally don't play games. The controls are simple and fun for beginners everywhere! I know I've converted a few people :D)<br /><br />Flower - I just started playing this but oh wow addicted. It reminds me a little of a racing game with the controls but the point is completely different. The graphics are a little bit older but it definitely doesn't take away from this game's majestic beauty! I played through 3 whole &#34;levels&#34; before tearing myself away to go sleep (and I had to wake up early too so I mean, it just goes to show you how much I liked this game).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good graphics and there is always something to do while something else is being done. There is the option of buying gems and coins but there  Really is no need to, the game can be played with or with out buying.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|What a great read. If you have never read this classic you need to. Great read at a great price
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|I found this movie better then I had expected. I liked seeing Selma Hyak as a dark character Over all I enjoyed it.
1595827684|5.0|I've loved the Mass Effect series the moment I started it. It has played a huge part in my life via playing for 8 hour periods and staying up online sobbing with many people about how beautiful it is. And so in this way I'm extremely bias in finally being able to have the character designs and art all in front of me at once. I can spend hours reading through this book and staring at all the pictures.<br /><br />Particularly because I love working on my own stories, this is a great way for me to get inspiration and draw my own designs!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This is a very fun game!! I can teach my two grandchildren to match, as well as touch and drag pieces! Love it!!
B00CXQL828|5.0|I like the CD a lot. It has great singing from Kotzen, great musicianship and some catchy song writing. The CD has great hard<br />rock melodies. Much like Shehaan's old band, Mr Big. I definitely recommend it.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|While not the epitome of academy award winning film, it was a good entertaining movie. And a good cast to support it.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|AM is a fantastic album. Arctic Monkeys don't disappoint. I didn't expect anything more or less. I'll definitely be listening to it on replay.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />The autorip feature is unclear. You can't automatically download your music. Mine kept telling me that they encountered an issue and it would download in 15 minutes. It took a whole day. Customer service wasn't very helpful either. They didn't explain the issue and basically just told me to wait and it should show up eventually. I finally got my music though, so all is well. Just a warning.<br /><br />Everyone should buy this album, it's lovely!
B005DF2QMC|1.0|The item didn't work, I mean would not play, rewind etc., I am experienced with this type equipment and noting I could do would get any response. I returned to Amazon with no problem
B0051BVQFG|1.0|I can not believe that anyone out there could like a movie that is unwatchable. How can anyone see any action when the cheap hand-held camera is being held by a drunken cameraman? How? I hope and pray that someday the movie producers are required by law, and be punished severely if they break the law that says that they are NOT to use a cheap hand-held camera and NOT use a drunken cameraman to do the movie...<br />By the way, I don't really know if the cameraman was drunk, but the action in the movie is very shaky.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is addiction. Can't get off. A must have game. U need this game if you don't have it already. Nuff said
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|This music is pure nostalgia. Loved wings music full stop. And hearing Lynda McCartney at keyboards brings in joyful visuals. She and Paul were a match made in heaven.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I've been connecting a 20ft. HDMI cable to my laptop to stream to my TV. What a pain that was. So glad to get rid of the cables all together now. The Chromecast is a great addition. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems to have a bit of issue streaming video from Google Chrome. I tried streaming one of the NFL football games from NBC.Sports.com in the Chrome browser and the video would play for about a second then hang. I imagine things like this will be fixed in the future since the Chromecast is new to the market. They just gotta iron out some of the bugs... Besides that, I love it!
B005HI7NY6|5.0|Depeche Mode at their finest! Hauntingly dimensional with overtones of dark and meaningful lyrics. Dave Gahan reaches out in the video productions especially !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great! There's so much to do and you'll never get bored. You can feed it, groom it, choose it's outfits and your own, and compete in competitions. Plus the graphics are amazing!
B004132I20|5.0|Always been a Sherlock Holmes fan and this series adds a nice modern bent with the inclusion of trends like blogging.  Acting is superb!
B005ORVMT2|5.0|I wanted to let anyone considering buying this set to know that all issues or defects that have been talked about on previous reviews, have all been fixed. I just recently got this Sector 1 set as a birthday present from my kids & they did in fact  order it from Amazon. There are no defects or imperfections of any kind with this set with any of the discs or packaging. I'm a pretty serious music & movie fan & i am very picky & meticulous about my cd cases & packaging & am a full blown audiophile. If there were any imperfections at all in the sound of these discs that would absolutely not be acceptable to me & would drive me nuts. So if you're a Rush fan thinking of getting this, you shouldn't worry, all issues have been taken care of & this is a really great set i like it a lot & i will be getting the other 2 Sector sets!

015603008X|5.0|When I reread Flowers for Algernon, I was stunned at the emotional depth of the novel...and how thoughtfully and carefully it was written. This novel comes from a very special time in America -- 1950s to early 1970s -- when our books, films, and music inspired the world with their ennobling qualities. I urge everyone who believes in art to read this book. Better yet, share it with a young person. Then they will know what America is capable of -- optimism and inspiration, not sarcasm and cynicism (so common today).
B0015AARJI|5.0|As one who has just recently upgraded to the PS3 (just in time for the PS4 to come out), I only have good things to say about the PS3 controllers.  This is all old hat to just about everyone, but I'll go ahead and point out my favorite things.  I love that the controllers are now wireless and they have a really awesome battery life (at least ten hours for me).  They charge very quickly and it is very convenient to be able to charge the controller while still gaming.  It's also very convenient to be able to turn on the console with the touch of the PS button.  The controller is responsive, does not wear down too quickly, and accomplishes the task it was made to accomplish.  I love the PS3 and am very happy that they stuck with the controller design that they have used for the past two consoles.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I personally think this is one of the best apps well ever it's a game you can actually sit an  play for HOURS without getting bored try saying that about angry birds there's so much stuff to do that you will be playing this  game years from now and still have stuff to do by  I guess you guys also wants some dirt on the subject well first of your trying to woo  out humanity but that  in every comment so bye.
0671004107|5.0|This book is so much better, and so different, than the movie. That old Jodi Foster movie doesn't even come close. It's an older book, but I'm so glad I read it.
B00005QFE5|4.0|If you miss the wonderful American and British films of the '60s and early '70s -- think of \\"The Sound of Music\\" \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" \\"To Sir, with Love\\" -- you will love this film. Granted, it is much simpler and different than those three, but it shares a certain spirit and sincerity with them. A wonderful film about something important.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my Husband & he LOVES it! All his equipment & camera fit with room left over, so looks like he will be buying more equipment too!! lol If you are looking for a lightweight bag with ALOT of room & moveable partitions, this is the one you want. Lots of outer pockets & 2 inner pockets also.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|They had a lot of ground to cover, introducing all these characters to folks who might have missed the solo movies and still, they managed to get in a story that felt very mjuch like it came from a comic book.<br />The cast, the effects, costumes, sets are really amazing!
0152465073|5.0|At what point do we stop being children and become adults? Is there such a point at all? Not if you ask the Little Prince. The message of this book, in my opinion, is that in every one of us adults lurks a little kid just dying for the opportunity to come out and play. The book is a quick read, light but very entertaining and deeper than it seems. I read somewhere that the Rose was based on the author's real-life fiancé, and knowing this made her description/words even more enjoyable. Though written for children, I doubt that someone who did not go through a relationship could fully understand it. My favorite line: \\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\\"
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I'm very impressed with this game. Lots of levels. Not so hard that it can't be beaten but still a nice challenge. For the price, you can't go wrong downloading this.
B00B19G01C|3.0|I had really wanted to see this movie and I am still very happy I did but it wasn't the greatest nor the worst. It had an interesting story but it wasn't too engaging.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This little utility seems to work flawlessly and it definitely improves performance of winamp on my droid...I strongly recommend it.
140006922X|5.0|Wow. This intelligent young man has had the courage and diligence to put together an alternative view of Jesus as he may well have appeared to his contemporaries. This is not a new kind of endeavor; other scholars have done the same and their books can also be found on Amazon. But this author sticks to the meat of the matter without too much academic digression. No doubt his work has raised the hackles of very many faithful followers of Christ. But I for one can find no particular fault with him, being well educated in the subject matter myself. Now, would this good scholar be willing to do the same sort of historical analysis of the life of the Prophet?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is easily the best bang for the buck when it comes to home entertainment.  There are only a few apps at this time that work with the Chromcast but they work flawlessly and when more apps come out this is going to be, hands down, the device to go to.  Setup is dummy proof and involves plugging it in to your open HDMI port (they even include an extention dongle if your confines are a bit tight), downloading an app and setting it up.  The app auto-recognizes the Chromecast and you follow the prompts.  2 minutes later you are flawlessly streaming Netflix, YouTube, or Google Play music or movies.<br /><br />The Chromecast has proven itself to be reliable and is instantly on whenever I fire up the TV.  It sends HD quality streaming to the screen and looks fantastic on a 65&#34; LED TV and it also sends 5.1 digital sound to my receiver.  Really the only thing that you can ask for are more apps but Google has released the SDK (software development kit) out to app devs in beta and once they finalize it get ready for an onslaught of compatible apps.  For $35 I am willing to wait a bit for that.
B007R41E8O|2.0|I usually have good luck with ho games but this one has issues. It seems like every 5 min. it jumps back to the title credits. And then when you get to the scene that you were on the items you have collected are gone! It's a good thing it was only a buck.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I have seen this opera twice at local theaters (LA area) and thought that the movie would be a cheesy imitation of the grandeur and excellent theater performance of a live show, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie complements the live performance. You won't regret spending sometime watching it.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  It is a fun book that takes a unique look at fiction.  A good buy.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|World War Z is a great zombie movie. I read the book before watching Brad Pitt's big screen version and although it wasn't the 3-hour epic I was hoping for, Plan B has left plenty of room for a franchise. I hope they have set dates to begin production on part 2 and I also hope they do not let this summers string of flops deter them from moving forward. This was a crazy summer for Hollywood across the board. Zombies continue to be hot and an early 2015 sequel would be nice, a Halloween 2014 release would be even better. I'm sure Brad Pitt knows that \\"The Battle for Yonkers\\" must be included in the next version, as well as the wealthy \\"Mansion\\" scenes. Including the downed pilot would also be a huge addition. I think they did a great job with the first one and hope they take it even further for part 2 with a 3-hour epic!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|... I figure out the plot. I not going to mention where or how so I do not ruin for other that might not seen it. But I glad to have rented it as I would not have been happy to spent more money at a movie theater, because the plot is so obvious. The ending is so stupid I think the writer or director just go lazy!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I just love the story line! The characters are so interesting that I can't put the book down. Totally into the love story!
0142180300|4.0|This book is one of several that has come out due to (capitalizing on?)  the discovery of<br />the 'God Particle' aka the Higgs Boson, which is one of the major and glaring<br />missing pieces of the the Standard Model, which is the theory describing the<br />present state of nuclear physics to this date.<br /><br />This long awaited proof of the existence of the Higgs, confirms our understanding of<br />mass.<br /><br />When we speak of mass on a macroscopic level, we say that object is more massive because<br />it has more atoms..etc.<br /><br />But on a fundamental level, why is the electron 1840 times smaller than a proton..etc?<br /><br />It due to the way these particles interact with the Higgs Field, which in turn is mediated<br />by the Higgs boson, much the same way that electromagnetic fields are mediated by<br />photons.<br /><br />But the table in Appx 2, p294 has some typos:<br /><br />Down quarks have charge -1/3e.<br /><br />Up type quarks are top, charm, and up.<br />Down type quarks are bottom, strange and down.<br />Lepton types are tau, muon, and electrons.<br /><br />In the chapter 'Beyond the Horizon', the author provides a cosmological viewpoint<br />due to his background.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I truly love the beautiful puzzles. Sometimes I have trouble moving the last few pieces and sometimes the puzzle does freeze up on me. But those things do not deter me from always going back to the app for the gorgeous pictures. And most are free. OH I also love the free daily pics that you are always fun.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|An excellent movie with fun extras, very enjoyable to watch again and again. Recomended as a spooky holiday children's movie.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The room I s written from the eyes of a five year old boy.  The  heartbreaking part is that for all,his five years he has never been out of the smalll room which  he shares with his captive mother, ,  it is early in the  book where my heart wen t out to the young mother. Shre manages to teach her young son not only what he  would have Learned in school but she managed to,keep.his spirits alive too.  It is  when she is planning their escape that my feeling started t o change about her motives. With giving nothing away I must say,that  I disliked the mother intensely by the books end,
B004SOR4H6|4.0|It's the Twitter app and it's free. What's not to like? I haven't tried other twitter apps since this one comes from Twitter and it works so I've never had a reason or desire to check any other related apps out. It's simple and let's me check my Twitter account.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Incredible account of action. Marcus is an absolute stud! I would suggest this to anyone interested in the Navy SEALs. The details of the fight ans emotions throughout the story are so real and really pull the reader in.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|watching this show reminds of my adolescent days accidently tuning into it because I thought it was beavis and butthead and then it turned out to be pretty awesome.  It captured that feeling of highschool so well it brings that feeling of when I was that age more than 10 years ago.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Great series of books. Harry has a serious dark side but he is all on out justice and he doesn't like red tape. He is quirky. I started reading these books with Lincoln Lawyer. Now I'm trying to read them in chronological order.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very fun and addictive. I can not stop playing this game. I was surprised by how much I enjoy it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Before you spend your money- please read this.<br />I bought my daughter a LifeProof case for her birthday (iPhone 4S)<br />First water test failed- no phone in the case, so it was ok.<br />LifeProof sent a new case- no water leak.<br />As she was walking in our kitchen, she dropped the phone out of her hand<br />-she's pretty short so it only fell 18- 24 inches. The phone's screen shattered!<br />Contacted LifeProof and learned that they will NOT cover an electronic device installed in their case.<br />They will replace the case only. Make sure you read all of their excuses (aka fine print) on why they won't cover damage.<br />I am now filing a complaint with our state attorney general for false advertising<br />and encourage all others with similar issues to do the same.<br /><br />Amazon is great though!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I rate this game in real life like20 stars but I can only do 5 so I'm sad. But what makes me happy is playing... TEMPLE RUN 2. I love love love love love this game!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This is the only thing that makes me happy besides reading<br />I a
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Every once and a while they offer this for a free download. I suggest you grab it immediately. Even if you have to pay for it, its a solid app for those who need to check work documents while on the go using an android tablet or phone.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Great action movie!  This movie deserved more box office love than it got. I hope we get a sequel.  Lena Headey makes a great villain!
B005IQZB14|3.0|Info a little dated but a great story.  Back story cleverly woven to travel narative.  Seems more scary now than then.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is easy to use, however, be careful of the tasks you stop - it could be a task that is running your Kindle. It's very handy for completely deleting an App and all of its data in case you downloaded a type of spyware or malware.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great graphics and story line. Really enjoyed the challenging games. Really looking forward to the next one in the series. Please don't let that take to long!!

B005R32L66|3.0|I still have skype installed because so many people still use it.<br />but it is doing a lot ot things automatically.. like collecting contacts from all sources on my system.<br />i want to keep my business contacts appart from my friends and family.. but skype just grabbed them all and put them together.<br />I dont like that.<br />and..<br />I get all those annoying calls from contacts from ghana why cant the skype people block those golddiggers?<br /><br />remember ICQ?<br />in those days.. it was top of the bill.. untill it grew to big... and nobody could use it anymore.<br />this is happening with skype as well. people use whatsapp now..<br />skype goes same way as ICQ and LOTUS and IBM and the dinosaurs.. extinction!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app that gets me the information I need fast and easy. Highly recommended for Kindle Fire users, app has a beautiful interface that really pops!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|great game!<br />kind of tetris, falling blocks and clearing lines. but when playing it is so totally different!<br />3 ways to play... and I play all three of them depending on the situation, from waiting room  to a long bus travel.<br />realy addicting game. but so was tetris for me as well.<br />could have been a five star rating.<br />but...<br />it consumes a lot of energy! batterylevel  goes from 98 to 45 % after 55 minutes of playing.<br />and it could have been a for star if it had not those annoying series of taps you have to make before you can exit this games.<br />so three stars from me....<br />and a extra bonus star for the high level of addictedness ..
B008XTVWHK|5.0|I think this may complete my collection of Ray H. films,and I am glad to finally own this one,lesser known but not bad at all,tho the dino-critters all seem to be purplish in color.Still,no big deal.The chick lead is hot,James Franciscus does a good job and any fan of stop-motion animation should own this.Now back to watching Raquel in One Million B.C.(another harryhausen dino xtravaganda!)

B00AHJL7BK|3.0|this is sudoku with a touch.<br />interesting certainly, but if you like sudoku why change to something else? and if you dont like sudoku (anymore) .. you propably you wont like this game either.<br /><br />the graphic design of the game is overwhelming! to much colors and shadings wich is more of a nuisance. it would have been easiers for the eye AND the mind if the \\"painter\\"  had used the paint more sparesly!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I didnt do too much in depth research before ordering my Chromecast. I just heard all the buzz about it, and everyone comparing it to Apple TV. Im a little disappointed in its functionality at this time. Thought I know it will get better...out of the box, its no where near as functional as Apple TV and I dont even see how people can compare the two. And I hate Apple.<br /><br />Right now, you only get youtube, netflix (to which I dont subscribe), and Chrome tab casting from a computer. Not very exciting.<br /><br />Set up was very slick thought. Couldnt have been easier, and I liked how they designed the set up and installation.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I would give this app zero stars if possible. It didn't load. Looked like fun, but I will never know.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|Great app but it does not let you choose specific pages. I only needed 2 pages of an article and had to print 10. Wasted alot of ink.
B005LAII80|4.0|It was an underdog, but awesome. SEQUEL SEQUEL!! Karl Urban pulled it off perfectly, and the actions scenes where great!
B00DFFHUUA|2.0|There was a lot of action but its like the movie didn't know where to go next. The ending was dumb also. I should have rented. My bad.
B007V4LBLU|5.0|Brilliantly played and filmed this movie is a reference in cinematography. I've seen it when it launched 1996 and I was immediately impressed. It gets one of my highest recommendations.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|I have been a Sabbath fan since I was a kid and this one delivered the goods. I am glad the old fellows are still able to make good tunes.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I surprised myself by reading this book well into the night. Collins really has the gift of gripping suspense. The book still feels &#34;young adult&#34; to me, but that doesn't stop it's being a gripping read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun, entertaining and challenging! Love Gru's Minions! Haven't wanted to buy stuff yet. Just enjoying the game as is!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked the suspense and the characters.  The writer did a great job connecting the lives of each main character.  I could not figure out the ending --- a sure sign I will love a book.  I recommend this book to lovers of romance and suspense.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Found this game to be a real test of your ability to reason and a great way to increase your brain power.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|I am from a Detroit suburb and thought I knew a lot about our music and our very special musicians but this story is truly unbelievable and so uplifting.  I highly recommend it and it is worth watching twice. Find the JOY in this movie and its message.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The \\"Oh my's\\" And the Inner Goddess nonsense carries over into this book but I was able to drown it out because the story picked up for me. I began to really love Christian in this one and delving into his past a bit kept me intrigued. Still not fond of Ana but she is growing on me.  I felt this installment was much better than the first as far as the story. The ending of the first book had me cringing and ready to throw in the towel but I am glad I soldiered on.  Now on to book 3 and hopeful that the story is even better than this one!
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|this was a beautifule story and it had me going. This movie had me going for a minute and thats what I liked about it.  You could not predict what is going to happen.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Heavy stuff. Feels like you're right in the middle of it. Quite a notable achievement. Brilliant acting. Humor so dark your laughter feels like glass breaking.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It is easy to read and inspiring. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to make a change;)

B000850IHW|5.0|Nice redo of the original CD to celebrate the 35th anniversary, have heard both good and bad about the quality, but as a collector of GG, you have to have this regardless
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Not a bad game, but the levels are really short and too easy. Would love some higher difficulty as well as longer levels.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Google limited the usability.  I got it today and returning it.  Don't waste your time at present.  Let google make more app or let others to make app that work.
B001SGEUNI|4.0|I really like this one as well-- &#34;Familiar Taste of Poison&#34; is my favorite song of all on this CD!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Amazing actors in a story full of heart. Tackles mental illness with compasion and sense of humor.<br />Jennifer Lawrence lights up the screen
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|Awesome! Love this CD--it rocks and her vocals are out of this world on the slower songs. Listen to it all the time.
030758836X|4.0|This was one of the most uniquely written books I have ever read. The format takes you into a &#34;he said, she said&#34; fashion. it has been a while since I have enjoyed a book as much as this one. It would have merited five stars if the ending wasn't so weak. The author seemed like she lost interest and just shut it down.  Still I will be recommending this book as a terrific read for those who enjoy a fun mystery with twists and turns.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a really good one. I couldn't help but  cry at the end as I developed some sort of connection with all the characters. I will definitely re-read this book many times.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|I have read all three books (because of all the hype) and thought the first was interesting number two and three are pretty repetitive on the one theme. Nothing surprising in them. Don't think will bother with the film.
1451648537|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book about Steve.  I had no idea that his life was so complicated and made him the man he is.  It was all very interesting to me.  This is a different world than I live in.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|Great app I love watching twitch but please add chat mode I would recommend this but like  I said it needs a chat mode
B008XG1X18|4.0|Nobody knows that better than I. *chuckle*  This is overall a very well-done program that continues to add new functionality. It is not perfect but keeps striving to get there.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|my 6 year old now loves iron man.  He also now loves this app.  It is one of his favorite to play on free time
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He really enjoys listening to Bruno's music. Great songs and I received this promptly.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|once you get the hang of the very sensitive steering, game is pretty fun, i wish that the steering was less sensitive
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I thought the concept of this movie was horrifying... and I'm surprised that it's a popular series for young people. I would not watch it again and would not recommend it to a young crowd.
030746363X|5.0|I have read this book cover to cover now twice. I have used the dieting principals and they have worked for me. It is more than just a diet book, it has a lot of interesting information. If you find the human body interesting or are thinking about self improvement this is an easy place to start. Be ready to go down the rabbit hole that is the world of Tim Ferriss
B003NS1JHY|4.0|I thought it was an exciting adventure movie... better than most movies I've seen lately. I'm obviously late in watching it, but I thought it was good.
B00DW36G32|4.0|My friend and I rented this thinking it would be awesome to watch Travolta and DeNiro hunt each other. We were 100% correct. Bada$$.
B00AZMFJYA|3.0|OK, if you liked the first Star Trek that J. J. Adams did, you should like this one. I like the older Star Trek myself and have a little trouble dealing with the new old. Don't get me wrong there is enough action to keep you interested and a fairly good plot. (It reminds me of the second original Star Trek movie.....what was it? I forget...Wrath Of.....?.) Anyway, I noted a lot of things happening to Kirk (Chris Pine) that I seem to remember happened to Mr. Spock in the earlier movies. The move isn't that bad, but I just have a lot of trouble as this movie doesn't &#34;feel&#34; like Star Trek. If you like the &#34;new&#34; Star Trek, you'll like this, I just didn't that much.
