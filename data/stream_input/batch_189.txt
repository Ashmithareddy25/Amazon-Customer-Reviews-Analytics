B00DTUY0O0|5|Love this headband! I've received many compliments on it.
B0039UT9QY|4|This  foundation does the trick although it does not last all day it's still gives u great flawless coverage. Good buy!
B00GQU5YY0|1|Not water proof as it states it is, doesnt last long AT ALL,and rubs off easily.  Please don't waste your money or time
B002CMLS50|1|It's not the real deal.  Doesn't smell, feel, or look like the stuff you can get in the salon.  Don't buy.
B001FS0HAY|5|I bought this for my Dad originally. But I took it over and just love it. I use it to put eye makeup on
B007SP03WU|1|I had to return this after about a week as it smelled really badly. No idea if it was a fluke or they all are this way.
B000MATKPO|5|wanted to try a new kind of razor, very much like this one, and would buy them again
B00AHVVUGU|2|I guess my expectations were too high - I was hoping for a delicious citrusy scent but there is barely any smell at all - the instructions say to use a spoon full which does absolutely nothing, maybe they meant a bird bath.
B00QL2JJX0|5|This product is phenomenal. I have always had yellow teeth, and with the recent inventions in dental technology skyrocketing I was very skeptical about purchasing teeth whitening products. I looked around and I found smartsmile.<br /><br />It states that I should see a difference in jusy days of use. I have seen a difference, a huge difference. I am no longer ashamed to smile with teeth for photographs and otherwise. My teeth are actually beginning to look like those of celebrities in commercials. Will definitely buy again and will recommend to friends.
B001G7QHDK|5|It was a good buy at what I see and why I bought it was so I didn't  have to go and get it
B00CUG270S|4|I love it! Not sure if it's working until I go to the dentist, but until then....
B002GJU2YW|5|Just what my father needed and I was lucky to find it on amazon. Made my dad happy for older people do not like change and with him being 84 and living in a nursing home it even makes it harder to please him but this worked for him for he just wanted to keep the shaver he had owned for several years. Great job from the seller and would buy again from this seller. Thank you for you saved me from a big headache occurring.
B00E4OQ63I|2|The coverage is heavy and blotchy especially in hot weather. It melted of my face .
B00C7DYBX0|5|Second time I have purchased this product. Love it. It is very light.
B00754R1FQ|5|Beautifully made soap with an extraordinary fragrance that lasts down to the last sliver of soap remaining.
B0043OYFKU|4|I have bought this same cleaning system 3 times. I love the way it works, but I use it in the shower (never fully submerged in water) and I have to replace it every year to a year and a half. It stops working or starts works very slowly. It's still cheaper than the Clearsonic so I would suggest buying this but be aware you may have to replace it sooner than later.
B003V37Z6U|5|Purchased the RQ12 to replace my RQ10. The head works great( doesn't fit in the cleaning station, but never used it anyway). The 12 is a much better shave but because of its size a little more difficult in the tight areas.
B000S92OCK|5|It works, It works, it works! I have been using similar products for over a year and none have compared to one week worth of using this product.  I have fair skin but dark course hair and with any kind of waxing or shaving I get terrible ingrown hairs that turn into a mess for weeks.  This has cleared up blemishes in days.  Would recommend highly.  Plus, with other products there was a sting to it, this felt very very gentle..  never know it was even applied.  it does have a strong astringent smell to it, but not enough for me to stop using it..
B002RAR0BS|5|The best sanitizer and moisturizer in the industry. I will continue to buy this product as long as it is made
B00D9NV2D4|5|i love it so much works miracle on my skin... it became soft smooth and fresh just by days of use... i love the smell and the product is soft and easy to put on... i love my skin now very very clear and healthy looking... deliver very fast and good customer service... will reorder again... im a happy customer... Fatima Best
B00004U9UY|5|Not cheap, but the best! I love this stuff. A little bit goes along way. But shop carefully. Prices from different vendors can vary greatly. I paid $10 for a 100gm tube. Some places charge $20 or more.
B00COVKCDS|5|Does what its suppose to. I'm not going to write a huge long post because everything this advertises, it does. :)
B003COAFPQ|5|I started breaking out which is unusual for me. I used this castor oil & my face cleared up in one day. I have very dry skin & this is thick and rich and feels great. It's also supposed to be good for hair, so I started using it on my hairline. I use a paintbrush for both applications. I read that it is made from ashes & there is a slight ashy aroma. I only mention it because I know some people like scentless products. I love this product!
B00AAGDNA8|5|This tanning lotion is amazing. Not only does it give a deep, nice tan, it smells like I just put on cologne. Get this lotion.
B000G62HZE|3|From the reviews I had high hopes for these scissors.  The finger holes are a good size for a man's hands but if you have more than a few hairs to trim the scissors balk at cutting, just bending the hairs instead.  So it's kind of slow going.  Wish they were a little more substantial or maybe it's the sharpness that's the problem.
B0055WQLJ2|5|This product has a lot of space in it. This product was meant for the occasional traveler. The material isn't the best but it's worth the price you're paying.
B000E7SS4E|5|Nice Parfum!!! nice price!!!!
B001ECQ55M|4|Very good product. It smells great and moisturizes to a degree. Haven't been able do prove that ir really works like it says it do.
B00G5MSKEK|5|Great smell. On time delivery.
B000EGOEXE|5|worked on my dogs elbow to help with dry skin
B00F9X34XS|5|have had a a month now, I love it. the only thing I wish was the replacements heads were cheaper
B00FH692PQ|5|Great shampoo!  I am about to order my second bottle.
B0062W4LU0|5|This smells really nice
B00KQASCDG|5|I like this Shea butter, great.
B008QM4N84|1|I also have had an issue with the bottle top fitting on properly. Unable to use these as they also leak like crazy since the top sits on it so poorly. The price is great but in this case you get what you pay for.
B005OADB4I|5|Love it. It makes my hands so soft! It has a lovely vanilla fragrance. At first I wasn't too sure about it because it was a stronger scent than I expected and I don't particularly do well with strong fragrance, but I find it really lovely and not overwhelming at all.
B005ZYZUJW|1|We purchased two sets of this as a Christmas gift on December 17th 2013 , returned it few months ago and they are still not refunding our money. Last time I heard from them the owner was out of town, that was about two months ago.  The product was not as advertized on the picture and it was damaged. It came in a box that had so many cuts, seems like it was a reused box. There are other suppliers that have a way better service and product which we ended up doing. I am surprised that Amazon is letting them get away with this. My experience with the supplier has been the worse one so far on Amazon.
B0058AGBYG|3|This is good.  Not great.  It removes the longer finer hairs, but definitely leaves a little fuzz and absolutely does *not* take care of the dark coarse hairs.<br /><br />Overall, this product is good for keeping things &#34;maintained&#34;, but don't throw out those tweezers just yet.
B00GUO4RFY|5|Came in a vary timely manner! And I've already gone from 14G to 8G! Love them came out great
B00CYA5E1O|4|I have really bad eczema as well as dry,sensitive skin. I go through bouts of my face breaking out with itchy patches and small bumps. Tried this to get rid of the dry patches that have accumulated. Used the scrub and saw a difference right away in flakiness and dullness. I used Oil of Olay complete all day moisture cream for sensitive skin after. I was surprised at the effectiveness because even though I have never used a Clairsonic I figured it had to be a heck of a lot more powerful than this little guy but the Pro-X does a nice job. I believe over the next month or so I will be very pleased with the results. I am a 40 year old african american woman also.
B00GIXLG5Q|5|Makes for a great shave....
B000U0F9GA|4|It was ok
B000R8YKCE|3|If you're expecting, non-greasy, look elsewhere. Though it smells better than the average sunscreen, this product is greasier than any other product I've tried. I'm definitely not happy that I paid this much for sunscreen that's not any more quality than the $2 bottles at the store.
B00KYUXIOG|4|It really works.  A few minutes after applying, I feel a definite tightening of my skin.  Even those vertical lines on my forehead are diminished.
B000C1Z6VA|5|Just love the way this smells! :)  I was looking for a new fragrance and this is a good one!
B001B5A6Q6|5|exactly as pictured and advertised. Great Price and fast shipment! Couldn't be more pleased.
B00005K9CK|5|I highly recommend this product.  It works.  It may sting initially, but eventually you will learn to love it.  I will definitely keep using this product.
B005BOQH70|5|I only use an epilator for my underarms, so I can't comment on bikini or leg use with this or any epilator. I haven't tried the shaver or trimmer attachments, so can't speak to those either.<br /><br />I've used several epilator brands and this is one of the best I've ever used. This epilator gets even the really short hairs and pulls them out cleanly.<br /><br />Because the head is fairly wide, it can take a few passes at some different angles to get all the underarm hairs out. If this kit included an attachment cap that exposed only a small portion of the epilator head, it would be easier to use for underarms.<br /><br />The light is not so useful during epilation, but is very handy for quickly looking over the job to find the hairs that were missed. The epilator runs very well on a charge but runs corded, too, and the cord is fairly long.<br /><br />This is the first epilator I've owned with all-plastic &#34;tweezers&#34;, all others were metal &#34;tweezers&#34;.  But so far they are doing the job well, and only time will tell how long the plastic tweezers will hold up.
B001I2Q5DA|5|Rocket Fuel III is a staple in my fragrance collection. Truly. From this company and beyond to mainstream commercialized fragrances, Rocket Fuel III will always be part of my personal Top 10. It's sweet and versatile. Much like that fave outfit of yours that you can dress up or down, I feel the same way about this. I can wear it to work, a cocktail party, over to a friend's place, and I will always have people complimenting me and asking me what fragrance I'm wearing. It also smells deliciously mapletastic and would suit anyone!
B00BS9Q5OM|4|Great
B00OZQ7EQI|5|This oil does everything it says it does. My hair doesn't look dry anymore. Good stuff.
B0058VD7EC|5|Lemon and sugar what a match made in heaven. I brought this at a garage sale several years ago. I smelled it and was happy to give the lady three dollars for the full bottle. I used it sparingly because i coudnt find it anywhere else, and until became an amazon.com customer five years ago i never thought id see it again. This scent lasts along time because its oil based as opposed to lotion which is water based or perfume which is alcohol based. Im orderig the whole line!!!!
B005E4A6KQ|5|I use these every day.
B00A5C017U|5|Great product! I've been using Zweena Argan Oil for several months. After pastel painting for long hours, my hands take a beating. The Pure Argan Oil nourishes the skin on my hands, nails and cuticles in an unbelievable way. Zweena Argan oil is especially great for tired feet and dry skin on the feet and heels. I use it all over- face, hair, and body. You feel like you're doing something really good for yourself and you are!
B008S1FCEC|5|I love this stuff. I use it on my skin and in my hair after washing. It smells wonderful and works very well for me.  Thank you
B005FFVATK|5|Good
B00IOWR91O|3|This product has a strong smell. I rub some through my hair and and the next couple of days the strong  odor was still there. So try to not give anyone a hug when wearing this product because they might think you just stink.
B00E00X3VO|5|I love this organizer!  It fits my lipsticks, gloss, and chubby pencils perfectly!
B005HJQJG8|5|My skin was always in fairly good shape, but I feel like it's softer and smoother since I began using the Timewise Miracle set. I've been using these products for about a year. At one point I ran out, and decided to go buy some drugstore face cream and face wash. I almost immediately went back to buy more of the Timewise set because my skin felt either too dry or too oily with the other stuff. I missed the smooth and fresh feeling I experienced with Mary Kay. Before using these products, I didn't realize how dull my skin actually was. I also like the fact that the face wash, day solution, night solution, and moisturizer is packed together for your convenience and they sell 2 different versions for normal to dry skin or for oily/combination skin. I use normal to dry and I love it. My skin stays moisturized by it's not too shiny in my T-zone. I'd also like to add that I'm a 30-year old mother of two and recently returned to school. Most of the students have no idea that I'm over 10 years older than them. I'm not saying that it's because of these products, but I'm sure it's helping. :)
B00JZCXD7Q|5|Great tool for at home facials
B008XLEXRO|5|I love my kit. I bought this for personal use and I love the fact that it keeps the wax at an even temp unlike microwave wax. The lotions are nice and the wax off works amazing. Great!
B00ARBQ70O|3|It serves it's purpose. What I don't like about it is it leaves glitter everywhere in my bag,  and ends up on my face sometimes. Kind of annoying, otherwise it's fine.
B000PZ8F70|1|Pretty positive this is a knock off. I've bought this product before from a beauty supply store. What I received from my amazon order feels watered down and smells different. Disappointed.
B002K9FDQ0|4|Spritz it on and instantly clear the red out! I usually wake up, wash my face and then spritz this on. I see the red go away FAST! Then I use the lotion of the same brand to keep it away! This is amazing on my ruddy complexion! I still need something to clean my capillaries from the surface, but this is GREAT stuff for the rest of my face!
B0001MC0W8|3|I was hoping this would be a matte sunblock to wear under makeup because it's marketed as &#34;Ultra-Lite,&#34; but it still feels a bit too heavy and greasy on the skin for my liking. I probably will not repurchase.
B002QI2TPI|4|I like this...nice product.
B00SJKXDWK|1|The reason why I decide to buy these items, was the material &#34;surgery steel&#34; as it is a super high quality for our body and for the duration of the article .<br />With my surprised I realize that these are not make with SURGERY STEEL because they change the color as you can see in the picture !<br />Don't buy them , waste of time and money trust me
B004K0MVKS|5|I good product to begin with, but the price and free ship just makes this a nice add on item to good to refuse. They hold up wonderfully. Do not need to use a new one each time I do my nails. Still on the first one I started with.
B0006ZL30K|5|Perfect
B004AYY7T2|5|This &#34;hard-to-find fragrance Heaven Sent, is such a great fragrance & a favorite,so now that I'm able to order on-line from Amazon, I hope you will continue to stock this in both the cologne and body lotion as well as the perfumed powder, because I definitely will be a regular customer ! Thank you, PLongoria
B0055S4CRY|4|I've tried every neck cream from Mirenesse to Dior and back.  The Golden Balm is the only one that I've used that showed results.  It's very heavy and is greasy but soaks in.  It would be perfect but the rose scent kills me.  I thought I read it was available in unscented, which would be perfect.
B00K0LUGKI|4|Great for everyday and makes think hair feel/look full!  I've been using it for a year now and the first use it felt great and it still does today. I'm 44 with a full head of hair and normal male pattern baldness hairline. Love this stuff!
B00D1QY6YQ|3|I love it but also kind of disappointed at the size of it. It's not really a &#34;clutch&#34; it's like a small/slim purse.
B00742JW8S|1|Not great. Save up for a better quality one.
B001MIZBJY|1|Correct product...BUT 1 container completely destroyed, 1 container cracked, so only really received 2 in good shape.
B00O4G69DS|3|I like the herself straightner... But thought it came with a bag holder for it. But overall fast delivery!
B00D2GT4U6|5|Great cologne! It has a strong masculine scent to it. Lasts all day!
B00IPQ5QNW|5|This is the best product on the market !!!  Keep up the good work Australian Gold !!!!!
B00GWBSRE2|5|Very nice....
B00GTA8ZIO|5|I haven't found other eyelash curlers at any price that I like this much. I have little eyelashes, and these don't pinch the way some of my other curlers do. I hope these stick around. I couldn't find them at the drugstore.
B000I5J7MY|5|I cannot put into words how much I LOVE the Dermalogica line of products. I have tried everything from drug store staples to Mary Kay to Proactive and NOT A SINGLE ONE worked as well as Dermalogica. Specifically, I use the Skin Prep Scrub every other day after using the Dermal Clay Cleanser (which I use every day and also HIGHLY recommend). I have a bit of trouble with the skin in my T-zone area being rough and after using this product my skin is always smooth and glowing.
B002LE8OX8|5|Great buy. Planning to purchase a second one. Easy to use and enjoy the heat setting knob. I've been using the Chi for years now and I will never purchase another over priced Chi.
B00877C5LU|4|O'K
B001ET7BU8|5|I stumbled onto this product one day at Walmart.... I could not believe how much I love it!!!  Walmart no longer carries it, so I have had to look elsewhaere for it... and I am so glad I found it here!!!  It smells sooooo gooooood!!  No need to think about perfume!!!  This is so much better!!!!  It leave you skin so soft!!!  The best shave cream I have ever found!!!!  Just love it!!!!
B006852JQY|5|I was leery about buying tanning lotion online because I have heard (from people who work at tanning salons) that some of these products are bogus. I have tried other lotions by California tan and I was quite impressed, so I decided to gamble and order this lotion. I have sensitive skin and finding hypoallergenic lotion can be a challenge, but California Tan recommends their ‘bare science’ line for people who need a hypoallergenic lotion, so naturally I went with this line of lotion. I was impressed with the price because most products by California Tan can be quite expensive (sometimes $100 for 8 fl oz!). This is a good lotion that works very well. It has a light sent and absorbs into your skin. (some lotions have color added that can get on your cloths but this one is color free) I would recommend this lotion for anyone who needs a hypoallergenic lotion. I am happy with this purchase, mostly because I saved a bunch of money ordering this on Amazon versus ordering it from the tanning salon.
B00GPHK6KQ|5|Very long and very soft, definitely reccomend a pat down with a damp dryer sheet to keep the static down. For the price this is a wonderful wig! Only improvement I can think of is the cap underneath the red could have been a dark color instead of tan, but I did not have too much trouble covering it. Because of the length, it does tangle fairly easily, but can be brushed out gently with enough patience. Would not be the hair to wear on a windy day! Absolutely lovely color, will definitely be ordering in other colors!
B0014C4G5S|5|I Doris Taylor have'd used many lip colours, and many brand names.  But never have I found a brand and colour that I loved so much, that ever since I discovered Styli-Style Hi Shine Lip Gloss in the colour Sexy Martini,  I've bought nothing else.  When I went to my supplier to get another tube,  the sales lady told me the marketor's came in took all the old stock and replaced it with new fashion colours. I was so up set that I woulden't be able to buy Sexy Martini, frantic I started looking for a simular colour, but wasn't sucsessfull. Again I started to buy different brands that looked like the same colour, but just wasted my money. Then I got a idea maybe your web sight could help,  I was so exsighted when I was able to purchase it through you,  I orderd five tubes so I could have it for a while.  I only got four tubes I guess thats all you had.  I under stand that colours change, but I don't do well with change. If theres any way I could continue buying this make and colour I would be so greatfull,  I've told many of my freinds of your product how I loved it so much,  they them selves started to buy it. I were makeup every day I'm often told I'm sexy,  I beleive that a good lip colour makes all the difference in the world.  I can have all my makeup on but without my lip colour I'm not compleate.  Please help a despite woman stay happy.  Sincerly a product lover Doris Taylor
B003BPL57S|4|kind of filmy, but it smells so good. My lady likes it too.
B00005JS5C|5|This is a great little trimmer. It does get pretty close, so as an alternative to shaving or to trim up what you don't want \\"bald\\", you can't go wrong. I like that there's only one attachment that adjusts to any length so you don't need to mess with a bunch of different pieces. I was SO sick of razor bumps that I decided to give this a try and am really glad I did.  Now bump and irritation free! Plus, it's large enough to be expedient, but small enough to be maneuverable.  Overall, great purchase!
B003F7497K|5|When my favorite blush (Bourjois) started being impossible to find in my color, I seriously tried dozens of \\"top of the line\\" blushes. I went to the MAC store looking for a foundation and ended up with this blush simply because I loved the color, not expecting much else. This truly is the best blush I have ever used. It doesn't go everywhere and fall apart when you use your brush (even course ones like my ID brushes), which is one of my biggest pet peeves... It sticks to the brush rather than going all over the place and wasting it. This color is absolutely fantastic, it builds without getting cakey, the shimmer is beautiful... and it lasts your entire day, where normally I would have used at least one or two touch ups. Won't ever use another blush again and can't wait to try some other colors.
B00AKNST4G|2|If you have no protective cover cover on the front and back of you mini, this might be a ok product.  With a apple front cover, on it is just too small to hold the device and close without having to force fit it.  The other con it the protect thickness of the case is not much.  It may keep it form getting scratched, not sure it would absorb shock from a drop.
B006VDWCY2|4|I really like this by cream. It has pretty good coverage and seems to make my skin look a little brighter.  I wasn't expecting much but I'm very happy with it.
B000PQSI2Q|5|Have been using these for years - needed more for self and a gift.  They absorb all I need them to so I can still style without the drips, heavy towel falling everywhere and long time with the hair dryer.
B000Z5Y2XQ|5|I love this face cream, I gives my skin a beautiful glow. I've tried several face creams and this one is the best on my skin.
B002I1XTSY|5|I'm so mad that they stopped making this stuff. I am obsessed! The nozzel never clogs, and it suits my hair perfectly!
B0035CYONE|5|Loved the kit. everything as described. Had shipped overnight and came exactly on time in excellent condition.Do yourself a favor purchase a better quality ink. The ink supplied is only good for practice.
B00LXFD6N4|5|I love this stuff!  I have to have gel or else it will stain my shirts.  This stuff works great at keeping odors and sweat at bay.  I would definitely recommend this to friends and family!
B00AQ4YBXC|4|This bonnet really stays in place, love lining, ordered two will be ordering more,like the colours also, great buy,you will like
B009CGW15U|5|I highly, highly recommend TotLogic Shampoo. It lathers up richly and rinses very clean without any residue. It is gentle and oh-so-effective. This is my favorite shampoo by far, and I will purchase this brand from now on.
B001E96OCO|5|This is the best foot cream I have ever used.  My husband and I both use it for our rough feet.  It is very thick and creamy, soaks into the skin well without being greasy, and works instantly to smooth rough skin.
B006IBM21K|5|Decided to do shellac nails myself to save money so I bought this UV gel dryer, it works great. I still need some practice but I'm sure I'll be doing my nails like a professional soon.
B00170MAFK|1|These are NOT brush curlers.  It's my own fault that I assumed that they were, just because I had never seen mesh curlers that were not also brush curlers... I can't make these stay in place - or even in my hair - with the pins that I would normally use, and with my arthritic fingers, I can't make them work with bobby pins, either, so for me, at least, they are useless.<br /><br />Be careful.
B001C4Q3UY|5|I am a user of Elicina since 2002.  That's how I love this product. It helps my whole family with any skin issues.  Thank you!
B00CBNK74I|5|This is the best quality I have ever had and it was easy to use. I really loved this product!
B00HNYOBOC|5|I have been using this product for 4 years now, and for the price its the best I could find.
B00QMOVR1Y|5|This works pretty well and doesn't aggravate eczema. It cost a lot, but it was shipped from Europe, so that surely added to the expense. It also seems like a little goes a long way and one bottle will probably last a long time. I don't know why it doesn't seem to be available in the US, but I like it and will continue to use it as long as I can find it.
B0058L24O6|5|i love this bundle pack, it has a great variety of different sizes and looks. the packaging makes it easy to take care of the lashes for multiple uses.
B00H997VX4|5|The wig was better than i expected, also the quality is great. this is one of my favorite wigs so far. I recommend this wig, its great.
B00BJLK77U|4|This wig is amazing! I have blonde hair already so the seams do not show. Its super cute, and very long. I recommend not brushing out the curls unless you don't want perfect curls.Its curlier in person and the bangs are super long so I just did a side bang. Its exactly what I was looking for.
B003R5G0A4|5|Smells great!!! I've been looking for a fragance that represents a sofisticated personality for special moments and this is exactly what I found on this Creed Irish Tweed.
B004NNIXDQ|5|I love the colore and the smoothness of the lipstick. I t also lasts pretty well.This is a hard to find item
B0039MH4CS|5|This curling iron works very well. It comes with a glove to protect yourself from getting burnt and it heats up fast and curls hair like nothing else! It was delivered in incredible speed (before the estimated date) and it was a great price!
B0051ZHQEC|1|Waste of money. Made with cheap low grade materials.
B007RYVFC4|5|I wasn't sure if I'd like the Gillette Clear Gel Cool Wave - that I got free to try from Influenster - as I tend to stick with my ol' faithful Old Spice deodorants.    I nervously gave this a shot and was more than pleasantly surprised by how well it has worked.    We went through a stretch at work where it was 79º in the office (heaters were turned higher than they should have been) and if I moved away from the fan at my desk I'd start sweating... everywhere but under my arms. At one point I was even thinking about rubbing the gel on my forehead to see if it'd stop me from sweating there too, but thankfully they've fixed the heat problems.    The first couple of times I used it were a little tricky because I pushed out way too much gel than I needed, so it took a few minutes for my armpits to dry out. But once they did, the Cool Wave did its job and prevented me from having leaky pits. There's actually a guy at work that I'm thinking about buying some of this for because he's always getting the pit stains just from sitting at his desk... even before the heater problems. >_<    Being as hot natured as I am, I appreciate how this stuff goes on cool in the mornings. It's like I'm rubbing my pits with a can of beer from the fridge... not that I've ever done that, but you get the idea.    I also like how it doesn't make it look like I've got armpit dandruff when I take off my shirt. That's most definitely a plus.    Anyway, this stuff works...  Seriously.    I tested Gillette Clear Gel for free, but all opinions are your own.
B000VOP690|5|Lovely floral scent nice stay-on value. Highly recommend it!
B00HSE4WJG|5|good
B000052YM7|4|The smell of this product is not that good
B003K5VWX6|3|Kind of thin. I am careful with it. I am afraid it will break off.
B00005351F|5|Item delivered early, and works just as advertised.  Extremely pleased!!
B00IH118UU|5|Great in humid weather
B0045VJPT2|4|This oil works pretty good. Since its oily I cannot use all the time, but when I need to really condition my hair every other week, I try to use this sometimes in place of hair grease.
B00CQUX5S6|5|I purchased this item over a week ago and wanted to the time to assess the usage and my liking of it being that I work in sales. It quickly became my utmost favourite lipcolour of all it is vibrant feels like I have nothing on my lips and I can kiss my pets. I can eat with it on without reapplying it. When it does fade it fades very nice and it can easily wash off too. I take 2 showers a day.<br /><br />The colour matches my MAC eyeshadow pigment and that's a bonus.<br /><br />I have tried many other lip stains and this one is unique in superior quality. My lips do not feel dry or sticky.
B00HDZGF4K|5|have added to my organic vit e cream and use everyday and have noticed a reduction in fine lines and complexion looks brighter, this is great stuff !!
B006M6QI0M|5|If used correctly, this stuff is AMAZING!  LOVE IT!!!!!  I would definately use it again and tell my friends about it!
B008RC5ELI|2|I thought these would be for Manicure not pedicure. Also wanted hard not soft.<br />I would not be recommending these
B008RBT2TE|1|It's pretty bad, hair does match, it looks fake because it's too shiny and it's lighter then brown. And it slips off my head
B00J3HTC4G|5|Love the colors
B00MYGUJKY|5|I love this product. It is hard to find so I was very pleased to see it for sale. It shipped super fast and it is just what I wanted!
B0007V6PK6|5|I used this product and think it worked since I have very few stretch marks from my twins. I did not lie how greasy my hands felt after applying but as long as it worked that is a small inconvenience.
B007HKOYYO|5|Love the glitter
B001MA0QY2|5|Thank you works well
B004WPGXMI|5|I already gave pretty good eyebrows, and never used a brow powder before.  I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg to try a powder. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was, and how &#34;done&#34; it made my eyebrows look.
B0028OFUM4|5|Product was as expected.
B008ZBP880|2|NO AH LLEGADO ESTA TARDANDO MUCHO . ESPERO QUE MEJOREN LA CALIDAD DE ENVIO . TIENE MUCHO TIEMPO  EL PEDIDO
B001WAKUUC|5|Definitely longer eyelashes if you have patience to use it every night. Once you stop using it, the length and density of the eyelashes will go back to original.
B004B42RPC|5|I like this product a lot; but, unfortunately, I have been told  that it is being discontinued.
B00016XJ4M|5|Use it every day and love the smell.  very light and makes skin feel good after use. Would buy again
B003837V8A|1|This blow dryer worked well until about a month later. The engine seemed to have broken, there low and high settings are now both very low. Do not recommend. I contacted T3 they offered to replace it for $50. I ended up just buying a new dryer that wasn't a T3
B00SG1JXS0|5|Bought it as a gift for my sisters and wife. They like it.
B000V87BSK|5|I discovered Illuminare years ago and I've stuck with it ever since. I love the way it makes my skin look fresh, blended, dewy and very natural. It does not cause any breakouts or irritation to my very sensitive skin and I only have to apply it once and it looks good all day. I apply the illuminare first, then I apply a powder blush to my cheeks followed by bare mineral veil and then a few squirts of finishing spray to set it. This foundation is moisturizing and provides a light/med coverage so I'd go with something else if you have very oily skin or need heavier coverage.
B00DZWSB8I|5|I love love love it!!!
B006GW3KLW|5|Great, Great, Great! That's all I can say about these!
B0001435YS|5|I was having some panic attacks when I couldn't find this powder anymore in any of my local stores. I was extremely relieved to find it on Amazon! I was forced to try other compact powders in the meantime, but nothing works like this one does. It keeps the oily areas dry/matte while perfectly covering blemishes (not too much, not too little). I don't like makeup to look much like a manican. I've always rather liked my freckles. This works better than ANYTHING similar out there!
B004UQ6NP6|5|Works well even a year later
B00HIDT94U|4|it was purchased for a gift
B000C1ZC0A|2|Unfortunately this is not the Lauren that I knew and loved.  Disappointed in what has to be a new formula.  Bummed.
B001F51TR2|4|It makes my skin feel soft but I haven't noticed any skin difference. I've been using it about two weeks. I would buy it again.
B005MZS03C|5|great fragrance!! This is a great smelling fragrance it last a long time and my wife loves it. its my new favorite ,
B0051M46KM|5|I'm about halfway through my first bottle and I LOVE this stuff! I bought it because of the tea tree oil but I did not expect it to minimize my pores so well, even on nose! This is the best product I've ever used, I seriously love it.<br />So you can compare; I am 37 yr old female with an oily T zone and some dryness around my eyes and corners of my mouth, and cheeks.
B001DO6ZDI|5|I live directly behind a grocery store right where all the big trucks pull up late at night and early in the morning and these things have allowed me to sleep through the night. They're very comfortable to sleep in and come in nice individual packages so you can give them to guests or take them on trips. It sucks that you have to buy in bulk but I'll end up using them all eventually.
B000MX9XKI|1|Didn't last anything and made almost no foam
B004DBUAKM|5|I love Dove products and found this plum scent very natural-smelling.  Not overpowering.  It helps keep my skin soft and lasts a long time before I need more.
B00641UCY8|5|It smells really good,<br /> you don't need to use shampoo with it<br /> it can make ur hair 2 inches longer in 24hr<br />This is worth more than 5 stars 👍🏽
B001GS6OB4|5|Outstanding product! I had an Epilady for about 15 years and it finally gave out. This is a better product with a wider surface area that really grips the hair. Didn't have to make several passes over the same area. Used this on legs that had very thick unshaved 2 month old hair and was done in no time at all. Highly recommend!
B000VOP8DY|5|I first heard about this fragrance from a friend who wears it all the time. Every time I saw her I could smell this beautiful scent. I received it as a birthday gift from my &#34;significant other&#34; after giving him some hints. It is an absolutely lovely!  I have kept on wearing it and purchasing it from Amazon.
B0052P10ZM|5|Good. Good. Double good.
B005MZ4A7C|3|My makeup still rubbed off when blowing my nose. But it does feel good on my face.
B0013UAQ00|5|just after 1 application i saw a significant change/reduction<br />in my scar. every day i see improvement, scars r lighter & less<br />raised off the surface of my skin, its just this 6g tube is so small.
B00H4GI6MC|5|I can rarely find a wearable red - they're too orange, too blue, too strident, etc.  This one provides both a soft and snazzy look, if that makes any sense.  It's a great lip color but for cheeks only when used very sparingly.  I prefer it with RMS Demure as the cheek color.  Demure is a subtle pink which is all you need with any red lipstick, even a soft red like this one.
B0040PDKPI|5|This was discontinued by Vaseline and I dread the day I cannot go on Amazon and find anymore. I used to find it for years in the baby aisle then it disappeared!!! I panicked so you can imagine how delighted I was to find it online. I defy all facial rules and use regular soap on my face; and immediately slather this creamy (non greasy)formula all over it and my neck. My skin stays very happy!!!

B002UUT450|5|This is thick, so less is more.<br /><br />The consistency seems like it would protect the face in cold dry weather.<br /><br />It doesn't have a strong scent you can mix with acne cream before applying.
B005SB52PE|5|I normally use Dolce Gabbana Red but thought after all years I would try out Treso'r<br />I fell in \\"love\\" with it right away you cant go wrong here and the price is right:)<br />It will \\"turn heads\\"
B00OW9OTMK|5|I have been getting eczema (I think it's dishydrotic eczema) on my fingers for the last 3 years now every spring. This stuff is awesome. I've only been using it for 3 days now (was using the standard Gold Bond healing with aloe previously). The scaliness is going away, though I still have some dry dead skin from the blisters. I will definitely start using this right away next year.
B00DZZJB9S|5|Very good!!!!
B00A0VWOLC|5|I bought this case for my daughter who is a makeup artist and she loved it. It has a lot of room for her makeup. And what she likes about it is that when she does not have to use the whole case she can use half of it. It was just as they described it. And was delivered on time.
B003A4HSWQ|4|gets hands clean, fresh smell, and we use it all over our house to fill our soap containers. really appreciate the size and amount.
B003WR3QSG|5|Wish I didn't keep losing it, but I absolutely love this brush. Soft, and effective.
B00MGND6N2|5|it's not drying like so many others, and it has a great smell!
B00383I8T6|4|I have the pink cordless 8800 device. It is safe on darker skin. So If I have a the patience to see results, it is worth a try. A harvard dermatologist doc said never user laser on the face is you have tan skin.I have a lot of coarse wavy hair and Asian tan skin.. Waxing caused ingrowns and shaving would be a grind. After careful consideration, I am trying this tool. My goal is to go hairless at least for a month. Asking too much?<br />*****************<br />Week 1- I start on my arms and legs.First, I wash my arms and legs with soap and water and dry. I glide the device over my stubble. It takes about 1 hour - 3x a week right now. No PAIN!!! but a lot of burnt hair smell. Takes a little practice Always glide off and lift off the skin. Never stop on the skin or you may get a mild burn. Nothing major. And go over hairs in opposite directions of growth a few times.I notice the result is like a smooth shave. The tool burns the surface hair and weakens the hair root below. My arm hair looks smoother than the legs since my hair texture is less coarse. And it takes less time.<br />**********************<br />Week 2 - 5 - arms are still smooth and there is less hair to clear. Still 3x a week and 1/2-1hr each session. Tried to do the chin but I slightly cinched the skin. The unit jumps around the chin area. I will not attempt my chin or face since I scar easy. Sticking to threading or my epicure/bellabe spring for my curves on the chin.<br /><br />Week 6 - need replacement cartridge. It finally broke. I bought a bunch. Legs have 25 percent less hair and everything is finer in texture. I am getting excited to see what happens in another month. I use a hair cream remover once in a while to remove what is left over when I have a event. I notice very smooth and even baby like skin. The hair is thinner and the hair folicals are smaller.I don't recommend shaving the stragglers. It makes the hair coarser. And as the hair gets finer, the device works better.<br /><br />Overall- I use the highest setting on my arms and legs. It does not get all hairs everytime. My arms stay clean for a month. My legs is about 4 days. Better than every other day. 25%reduction overall for me and patches are hairless for months. Used it on my teen daughter's legs. Hair did not come back for a month. This product is great for virgin and fine hair.se the highest setting on my arms and legs. It does not get all hairs everytime. My arms stay clean for a month. My legs is about 4 days.

B0006NZ5S8|5|These glycerine-based lozenges are estremely soothing for irritated vocal folds and other tissues of the throat, especially for people who talk far too much.
B005W45Q9E|5|She loved the gift!
B009PIJLMQ|5|Perfect and the only whitening toothpaste that works for me.
B0128VS93S|5|This stuff makes me want to buy stock in the company.  It makes me want to slather over my whole body and run through the rain naked while clicking my heels.  From the moment I tried it, I was in love.  It has the perfect glide-stick ratio.  It's not too glossy, not too waxy.  And the scent is heavenly.  It's lasting power is perfection and it doesn't make for icky kisses, which brings me to my next point.  My 4-year-old son has also fallen in love.  &#34;Mama, you like to share with me&#34; is what he says right before he's about to steal it.  I accidentally made the mistake of letting my mom try it and she almost confiscated, too.  We all need the Acai Berry Natural Lip Balm.  All of us!  NEEEEED!  I thought I lost it on vacation last week and I almost wept.  I almost don't want to write about it, because I fear that I'll try to order some and it'll be sold out.
B001ADQTNI|4|this works very well. i have tried like liquid concealers and this one has worked the best for me.   also, it shipped very quickly. almost over night.
B00COVNG7W|5|Excellent brushes well worth the money. Had them over a month no shedding soft and durable great for make up artist
B0039PH51K|3|It is as described but it does not hit the spots I needed it to. I have not noticed any difference since using it. Better off going for acupunture.
B002YJ7ARG|5|Great product for thin hair, love the smell!
B00ITW3WCY|5|I received an incredible price on this Braun product.  This was a Christmas gift for my Dad.  He loves it.  The best electric Braun razor he has ever had.
B0009EILL2|5|These strips literally pull the gunk out of your pores. Only down side is the cost, but definitely worth it if you have a little extra money in your beauty budget
B0015YYTZM|2|Just ok. Has not been effective in controlling dandruff
B003FITQGI|4|You can feel it working
B001A3HPT0|1|Good kit, but the box was not packed well and the bowl was broken. It's just a hassle to return a small item like this.
B001CL6QIQ|5|just got it but it does seem nice on my skin.
B00014FME4|5|This cream is fantastic. I had stopped using Retin-A and my whole face broke out. Nothing seemed to be able to control the acne. Then I tried Nature's Answer Acne Cream and the results were amazing. Within two nights of using the cream my face looked as good as it did when I finished Accutane treatment years ago. Now I wonder why I spent so much time using Retin-A. Amazing stuff.
B001ET76PI|5|bought this for my friend as she has trouble finding it.  Was very disappointed with the description because it says &#34;(pack of 2)&#34;<br />and I received only one.  Not happy with that,but the lipstick is perfect.
B001UE7D2S|5|THIS LIGHT WEIGHT HAIR DRYER FITS MY NEED.  SINCE I HAVE A TOUCH OF ARTHRITIS IN MY HANDS IT WORKS GREAT.  EASY TO HOLD AND STORE. SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS ITEM. SO GLAD I BOUGHT THIS PRO STYLE DRYER.
B008HRYMKC|5|I read previously reviews before ordering these.  They were all correct.  I have tried a number of lashes but from now on I won't use any others!
B000GCXSHO|5|In the past I have not cared for Head & Shoulders shampoo because of the odor.  I love this shampoo!!  My scalp was constantly itching and bother me.  Since using this product I have not had any trouble with itching and I love the smell.  It leaves my hair very soft and smelling great.  Highly recommend.
B001EJOPOI|5|My grandmother used Complex 15 and I've been using it since I was a teenager. I've tried a lot of lotions over the years, from expensive to homemade, and this is my favorite.
B00IM0FSCA|5|This is a fantastic organizer. It seems like a silly little thing, but it is a remarkable product. The tubes do not knock around like they do in regular organizers. I was able to fit 7 Mac lipsticks, 2 NYX lipsticks, 3 Urban Decay lipsticks, 4 Mac lipglosses, 3 NYX Butter glosses, 2 Urban Decay High Gloss Lip pencils (in one slot), 2 travel sized Nars Velvet Matte Pencils (in one slot-they are the Sephora free birthday gift), 7 assorted lip liners (in two slots), and a lip brush in the final slot.<br />The only tube that doesn't fit is my Buxom lipstick, which is too tall for the regular lipstick holder but too wide for this lipgloss holder.
7414204790|5|Magical
B00GTX9UNU|5|These are very soft! I am so very surprised at the good quality for the low price. Great buy! Thanks!
B00BVJJL8Q|4|I would give 5 stars but its not really the same color as pictured but its still awesome. I've gotten so many compliments on how beautiful the color is and its really soft. I will definatley be buying again
B007K6K0IY|3|I got this deoderant from bzzagent, #gotitfree.<br />I like this deodorant a lot. it lasts all day unlike the dry kind. doesn't irritate my arm pits like dry kind either! has great scents also!. I personally not into gel at all.
B001F51QG6|5|Actually whitens and keeps them white if used with the rest of the saje line. The best brand for whitening teeth and keeping them white.
B00064JGBO|5|I am obsessed with this scraper.  I've owned and broken many plastic ones, but this one is incredibly durable and much more effective than its thick, plastic counterparts.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
B003ES7GRA|5|I was replacing this with my previous ghd which I got for full price and worked great for years.. Though i was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews, but couldn't resist because of the price.. I checked the product the minute I got it and went online and found out I got the original..
B00FQ87HPM|5|I needed a wig for a bachelorette party in Vegas and the wig I got was perfect!  The wig quality was awesome!  Looks and feels like real hair!  The only complaint was, I ordered the green wig, and it was much more iridescent than the picture.  I would recommend this wig to anyone!
B00501345C|5|Recommend this wonderful cream highly!  It is priced very fairly.  It is an excellent product - been using it for years!!
B0095IMNI0|5|It is an excellent product. Absolutely worth every penny. Makes flossing a quick,easy and fun thing to do. I bought one for my niece. As a tool to improve dental hygiene, it is very good investment. Your teeth and gums will thank you for getting it.<br /><br />Generates enough pressure for flossing. One thing I would add that no one else has probably added is that the sonic toothbrush has excellent battery capacity. It may not be the best wizbang toothbrush, but if you can figure out how to make the best out of it. It is to brushing what safety razors is to shaving, gets the job done quite well..<br /><br />The ONLY problem is that it is not using international voltages. Sticking with 110V AC only means that your device cannot be used internationally. Waterpik should really consider improving that part.<br /><br />It is small, but it does take countertop space. Wall mounting model might be a good idea too. It is a bit noisy to use, but it seems to be using a reciprocating pump to generate the pressure. Body is plastic, but it is a very good quality plastic.
B001PTFV72|4|Little too sweet of a fragrance but I recommend.
B00ELNDKUY|4|I love Wen products! My favorite scent is the six thirteen but it is not an every day cleanser. This scent is ok. It is more of a spice scent, I don't really smell any apple. I will probably go back to the Ginger Pumpkin fall scent or the Fig.
B000SOWFYM|5|Never been disappointed by this Physician's Forumla. Eyebrightener is great is you just want to quick sweep some color on your eyes before going out the door. The eyeliner 'pen' is more like a marker, and it is great for making precision markers. Looks like liquid eyeliner. Does dry out after awhile, but it is after all a marker. The mascara was just ordinary mascara. Good price for the products!
B005FJQQMC|4|I saw this product and thought \\"I have to have these!!\\" Before I ordered I went and read a bunch of the reviews. Some people complained of there only being 5 sizes, and some of the ends were the same size. I still though I should take a chance for the price because I saw others for just 5 sizes that was higher than these.<br /><br />I just got these in the mail today so I haven't actually used them yet. At a first glance, yes some of the sizes do look alike and some seem like they have the same ends. But after closely looking at them and just using them to make tiny dots, I have found that there is in fact 10 different sizes. But just looking at them they do loo a lot alike in the sizes. So I can see why some customers thought that they only received 5 sizes.<br /><br />Overall for the price, this is a great item and I received it exactly on the estimates date.
B00BGBUQXS|1|I love CeraVe because I have sensitive skin so I wanted to try the sunscreen. I learned that most sunscreens on the market are actually chemically based and is not good for your skin. The fact that this item has titanium dioxide and zinc oxide I was sold!! Those are the two ingredients your skin needs for sun protection. I am very tan and as much as I tried to rub it in I was white as a ghost and my friends told me I looked ashy!! I do believe this product works. I just wish it didn't leave my skin so ghostly like!!<br /><br />I will continue to use the body lotion and facial lotion but will search for another sunscreen with the same ingredients.
B0017Q86VQ|5|I'm delighted with these soaps. The only thing that would make them better is if they were individually wrapped instead of side by side in the same box. The scents tend to blend together but it's still a nice scent. Some scents I like better than others but it's great to be able to try different ones.
B00THESCSW|5|Pleased with product.  Will buy it again.
B00BZAWSS6|5|i love it
B008GR4L18|1|The picture isn't the same what you get.<br />Was not happy with it.<br />Looked like a Halloween wig<br />Came with comb that would pull the hair out.<br />Wasn't worth the money not happy
B003JN9UR4|2|Cheap made, weak power (even plugged in to 110).  Not very effective. Takes too long. Pretty much like the older epilators, just a little more compact.  On sensitive areas, you feel like it is cutting or scraping into your skin.  Leaves a bunch of hair behind, so you would have to go over and over, several times.
B00KWTYYWE|5|Love this moisturizer when used with OZ Naturals hyaluronic Acid Serum.
B002I4Z6TG|5|Awesome product
B0049LUI9O|1|worst 15 dollars ever spent the thing worked one time and never again
B0026J10CU|4|Great Eyeshadow Horrible Packaging. The product its self is amazing it goes on really good great color. However, the packaging is horrible, i got the palette today and 4 of the colors were broken, they put these little air bags in the box but that was not enough to keep it from breaking. although the palette was covered in bubble wrap it still didn't have enough support. so yeah the eyeshadow is great but packaging not so great. i would recommend this to anyone!
B00HZWDDIM|5|works great!
B002ZTVMDI|1|I loved the store bought version and decided to buy the same stuff online because I was feeling lazy.  The online mascara received was dried and clumpy.  Perhaps I just received a bad batch.
B00FCNV3V0|5|It is perfect  I ever had
B00NQGWFCQ|5|I was so please with my retinol serum. Feels so great on face and neck. Can wear under makeup. After showing and before bed. Is one of the best I have ever purchased. Would say to all, ORDER,ORDER, ORDER.
B00OIEE8WA|5|This lotion is worth buying it! I received it for review, I absolutely loved it! Smells so good!
B004EAFM78|5|great product!! super convenient for different purse sizes! always found it hard to find things in my bag, now it's easy and organized. both me and my mom are enjoying it! Thanks!!
B003ATS2QC|5|Just as advertised
B000E7SSCQ|3|This fragrance is beautiful.  I do love, I Love Love...that said, it's not quite as potent as I like a perfume to be.  I use about 5 sprays of it and still people have to struggle to smell it on me.  More like a body spray than a perfume.
B002CMLH6A|3|This conditioner is indeed moisturizing. I gave it 3 stars because unlike other hair moisturizers that leave your hair soft, silky and managable, once you wash it out, it left my hair stringy, heavy, and flat. And now I'm stuck with 37-oz of it. So now I am experimenting with it and applying it to dry hair after it has been flat ironed for a few days. So far it's been pretty managable.
B005VEDN0O|5|I use this product to add some regenerating feature to my creams, and it works well, it is soft, you can just adjust the dosage (within the limits indicated on the bottle), and get your skin regenerated like that..<br />i used it on my hands and legs, and am very satisfied, will rebuy !
B003S17772|2|These eyelashes are thick but not long. If they were longer they would be perfect. These are perfect those ladies that just want fuller lashes.
B00FCO1L7A|1|Horrible , please do not buy as it bun and leaves  black mark
B00139JB6G|5|Perfect, perfect, perfect for french nails!!!!!<br />I love this, and I even use it when it's not frenchy.<br />Highly recommended!
B00QMWXPUC|5|Out. Standing. Soap.<br /><br />Every scent is obviously made with the highest quality materials, like bits of actual lavender, etc. My girlfriend says it makes her skin softer than anything else we've bought in a store.
B0058SY1XQ|5|Ordered this product for everyday grooming. The attachments are perfect -- great quality and easy to remove and clean. Makes crisp outlines at the neckline, sideburns and around the ears. Nose and ear trimmer was an added bonus for me. Haven't had it catch on my skin at all. Five star recommendation. Just remember not to clean the blades with water.
B000VT2GYS|3|This Product does hold by it's self as long as you roll your hair once or twice on it. What I dislike about it is that it pulls your hair and gives your hair this staticky fly away look. Also it will cause breakage because it pull out your hair.
B004D281V6|4|No complaints
B00KAHGW6Y|5|I enjoy using this product it really hydrates my hair. I did receive it with my (2) pumps.
B005CLKOSU|5|This polish is my favorite. The color is a deep purple...almost looks black, but very dressy. Super Shiny and lasts 3-4 days, no chipping.
B001HKR6WM|4|I do recommend this had it for a year and they are wonderful<br />!
B002XHC4I4|5|Covers my blemishes and glides on smoothly. Very impressed. Definitely repurchasing this item when I run out. Love it !
B001DOJPGM|5|This is the longest-lasting lip color I have found, but it does have a drying effect, and the gloss eventually seems a bit gummy. Nonetheless, the advantage outweighs the disadvantages for me.
B000CPIMNA|4|Good thanks
B000P1S0N8|2|I bought this and tried it. I returned it. It didn't absorb well, kind of sat on top of my skin, the green tint made my skin look  pasty/chalky.  I do love the gel cleanser for sensitive skin, and the night cream too.
B00B166I58|1|My hair did not come out this color... At all
B00E4MND36|5|These things are fantastic! I brushed my teeth with my sonicare toothbrush, then flossed, then sonicare again and then used one of these....it was amazing the junk that came out!,,
3292000971|5|Love,love this marvelous soap. Have found all of L'Occitane's products to be of superior quality. Recommend  this very highly. Thank you
B00C5AHTAC|4|Good Stuff!
B000NN3H86|5|Love it, bought it for my wife and ended up using it myself!
B00PUMYJI2|3|I wanted this to work and it does, in a way... it smoothes the feet for the day and the next morning you have to start over. And Im not running marathons to be honest.<br />not the best
B00OUPS012|5|Better then I thought it would be. Had a protective case on my plus six and fits in very snugly. Close and swivels very good.
B0032NK1II|5|Absolutely no bug bites on my family while camping this summer!
B009NNFB0O|5|This really is a great product.  It helps keep my beard manageable and it conditions as well.  It also has a good smell.  I've tried numerous other products but none are close to matching up to this quality.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product!!
B001UT4JAM|5|Lovely lavender smell,very relaxing and comfortable o sleep with it. I will order again a flaxseed one that its heavier on the eyes
B00ALKHY9O|5|Received this item and am very happy with this purchase.  Good quality for such a low prices and it came to me fast.  Now I can use my razor blade multiple times.  Happy to save $$ from not having to buy more razor blades for a longer period of time. Thanks.
B002GSXS4O|5|These are the original replacement parts; feel free to order with confidence. Apparently I need to type three more words lol.
B00150LT40|4|I have tried so many different top coats and this one ROCKS. What used to take me 2 hours to dry now takes 10 minutes tops. For me it doesn't increase the length of my manicure but it dries quickly and that's what is most important to me. An amazing product.
B00XJ5JQ2G|4|I love these brushes! I was hesitant because this set didn't have reviews on it yet but I really wanted the gold on gold color way. I'm glad I bought them! There are little flaws on about 2 of the brushes where the bristles are slightly uneven but it's barely noticeable and its an easy fix. The color is gorgeous and the nice &#34;leather&#34; bag was a great touch for storage. Also can with a small eyeliner brush as a free gift ☺️ The small thank you card that came with the package from the seller was very nice and provided info on how to get rid of the paint smell the brushes have when you first get them. 👌🏾<br />Oh and the brushes are labeled with the brand name however not the name for each particular brush (this doesn't bother me though)
B001MA0QY2|5|I was a CHI flat iron user. After replacing it twice, I decided to purchase another brand. I love the way HSI leaves my hair. My hair looks healthy and straight. I am extremely happy with my purchase. I love that I can have the look I want in less time than with my previous Iron.
B00427UV3S|5|A wonderful smell of erotic and sexy .
B00CP7BYPG|5|My company does not mind my beard, but requires it to appear neat and professional. With this, I can grow it as long as I want and maintain a tame, professional and show worthy beard!
B004OHQR1Q|4|These are great! I love the way they look but they do seem a little flimsy. I purchased almost the exact same set and they broke the day I got them but these haven't yet so I'm keeping my hopes up! They cam in about 2-3 weeks but I don't know for sure because they came when I was on vacation. Anyway, very good product for the most part!
B005F1ILHS|1|I feel that this has been waterd down. I still have a little but left from a bottle that I bought at a hairdresser and it smells better and works great on my hair.  But when I used this one there is no odor not feeling (aka sticky) and does nothing for my hair.  Sorry
B002PBHQEK|5|Love this for several reasons...<br />- When I'm done, I feel my face really does feel clean.  It has an almost minty feel, then when you hit it with toner - WOW!  Will wake you right up.<br />- Doesn't take much to use.<br />- The \\"scrublet\\" feels like it's really helping the cleanser do its job; it rinses clean in seconds; it attaches to the bottle, so you always have the cleaner and scrublet together; PLUS you get a brand new one every time you get a new bottle.<br /><br />The only thing I would change about the product is:<br />- The bottles aren't clear as to what cleaner should be used on what kind of skin.<br />- It should come in a body wash!
B00BISJ5OA|5|I have extraordinarily long hair and only need to use a very small amount of both shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair feel great, worth every penny
B000NL0T1G|5|prefect, just what i needed.great shipping, product was as described.
B00DYZ7ZCO|5|Great shaver.  Replaced a Braun that I had for years.
B00KGO8XY0|4|Really thickens and lengthens!
B00CLHH6IO|5|&#34;Bien-etre&#34; is the best baby cologne ever.My mom bought all the scents for my kids and this one(Eau de Cologne Aux Absolues de Roses)and the blue (Bien Etre Eau De Lavande Naturelle) are my favorites. I got lot of compliments that my kids smell good.This is nothing but &#34;Bien-etre.&#34;
B009PMZBLC|5|just wish it didnt come with a foundation brush. but great quality
B000W6EWY2|5|Grandson loves brushing his teeth now!
B001VEK1IU|5|This OEM replacement for Braun shaver was just what I needed to get back the close shave I had when I bought the shaver. Replace your blades every 18 months and you'll keep getting a close shave.
B00JIAT55O|5|Great value in this, keep my collars crisp and presentable, I hate feeling self conscious about curled collar tips from the laundry, gives your shirt that extra edge it needs to look nice.
B00CHHJX0M|3|I purchased this toner a while ago to (hopefully) help combat my semi-oily skin. I was pleased that this product was natural, as I feel like I have sensitive skin that breaks out very easily. I began using this product by putting some of the toner on a cotton ball and wiping it all over my face. I was pleased it did not leave my skin feeling like it had been burned but instead left it feeling fresh and clean. However, after using it for a while, I did not notice a difference in the oiliness of my skin which was a disappointment. Additionally, I did not feel that it made my cheeks appear any less red which was also a disappointment. Therefore, I discontinued my use of this product and have since found a toner (a toner made by the company Acure) that I feel fits my skin care needs much better.<br />Pros:<br />1. Natural<br />2. Price- fairly cheap for a natural skin care product<br />Cons:<br />1. Did not improve my skin
B001BBMO2E|5|This light, quick-drying gel hydrates my face and leaves it softer than any other moisturizing gel I have tried. I have combination skin, but have not had any dry patches or break outs since using this gel in combination with SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic every morning. I have been using it for two years now and am completely hooked. My skin loves it!
B007HBERUE|1|POOR QUALITY. LIKE HANGER WIRE. FLIMSY.  THREE PEOPLE TRIED AND FAILED TO GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY,  WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
B000HIYE0M|5|I've used this shampoo for years. I love the way it smells and it leaves my hair feeling clean without a lather.
B00H1YKI6Y|5|color was perfect.  love the look
B0015NZ6FK|5|I never used a sleep mask before, so I am surprised at how comfortable this one is. It's silky soft and padded. It really makes a difference in the quality of my sleep. The smallest bit of light affects sleep quality, so unless your bedroom is dark as a cave, you really should have one of these masks.
B00DCNBST4|4|I think this product makes a nice gift. It's nicely packaged (for the price) and when you open it, it smells really nice. It is indeed a strong smell, but that will diminish when it's used.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% sea salt, vitamin e oil, lavender essential oil<br /><br />As others have said, the directions call for one cup per bath, so being only 16 ounces you'll probably get 2 baths out of it.<br /><br />So, as a gift or for infrequent use, I think it's a nice little luxury product that's not too expensive, but for using regularly, you'll probably want to find something cheaper.<br /><br />Overall, 4 stars.<br /><br />NOTE: I received a free product sample for review.
B006NXRD5S|5|Works good.
B004L8RWJE|1|I ordered this 4 months ago.  Used as directed.  I DOES NOT WORK!!!! IT WILL NOT GROW YOUR HAIR!!!  WORSE, AMAZON WILL NOT ACCEPT RETURNS AFTER 30 DAYS.  YOU ARE SCREWED.  YOU CAN ONLY GET 6 MONTH GUARANTEE DIRECTLY FROM SPENCER FORREST (if you want to waste your money...but maybe it will work for you).
B000MGSJBY|5|Good
B003HNSA3G|5|it is useful .<br />it help me good<br />i like it ,<br />it look not bad.<br />~~~ ~ ~ ~
B00ISDOYV2|5|I use this to mix a couple of different skin care treatments. I like this powder and I like using seaweed. This is very good quality, good texture. There is a very strong smell with seaweed that lingers--it smells like it is straight from the ocean. Takes a while to get used to--essential oils help.
B00S0LF2M2|5|Love using this amazing balm.
B00DCYRQ5I|1|Total waste of money! Fell apart after first use! Don't even bother wasting your money on this product!  Awful! Awful,
B00G6P0F3U|1|Came in huge box all linkage from top
B010GKUBE8|5|Perfect for doing your own manicures and pedicures
B009GEUPDS|4|I like how it vibrates i like the little brush but personally not a big fan of the cleanser. kinda dries my skin out and the color is silver and kinda weirds me out but with a different cleanser i will continue to use this!
B00375BUQ8|5|Love this Razor!! Great for Shaving my head.
B000ZON6QG|5|Every bit as good as much more expensive products.
B000MAOWMA|5|My kids were very happy the day these showed up. They are very hard to find where we live. My chlidren were excited by the assortment of characters as well. Which means less trouble getting them to brush their teeth.
B000VOHNZ0|1|When I found out Bvlgari did a scent based on rose, I thought what could go wrong? All their other women's fragrances are so good, I assumed wrongly, it wasn't worth taking the time to test the scent before purchasing.  Nice bottle, but doesn't really smell like what one thinks of as rose at all. or perhaps one of those tea roses - very average. I was hoping for the full rich dark red rose scent. If that's what you're expecting, then this is not for you.  I like the bottle, but I'll stick to the other Bvlgari women's fragrances in the future. This ones a bust.
B0037YQRCG|5|Got these for a Halloween costume for a party.  Everyone kept asking me how I got hurt!  They were great, very real looking!
B001C57NF2|5|Love this.
B006MD1PBC|5|As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret's NEW Outlast Clear<br />Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.<br /><br />I had never used Secret products before, so I was not sure what to expect.  However,<br />after using the product I found this product is really good in preventing odor.<br />I felt no odor for more than a day after applying it.<br /><br />Generally I sweat a lot and it makes odor. This Secret Outlast Clear Gel controlled<br />my sweating a lot, and the most important thing is it prevented any odor coming<br />from me.  I am amazed at how this product worked for me.  it left no marks on my dress.<br /><br />I am a Professional woman and would really be embarrassed if a mark was left<br />on my dress.  I am absolutely satisfied with the Secret's NEW Outlast Clear Gel and have<br />already recommended about it to all my friends and co-workers.
B000143EGW|5|Best product my wife has been using it as a treatment, it works for her .<br /> Now I have  ordered it for 3rd times .
B001U2IVSK|5|I love this product! I use it in a mist mixture for my hair.  It makes my hair soooo soft.  The shipping was expeditious (before the scheduled ship date) and came in excellent condition.  I would purchase from this vendor again.
B00AXJ9PPO|5|Love this product & excellent service!
B00UVRW6JA|5|As advertised. Seeming high quality
B000MU3M26|3|I bought this for my father. I'm not sure what he thought about this product.<br />I did ask him once, and he said it was ok, but nothing special. He did say<br />that because it didn't wear very good, he stopped using it months ago.
B005CZJ2DO|1|I was disappointed with this product. It NEVER worked right and was very thick and sticky. Not at all shiny and fun. I gave it my nieces and I'm sure they threw them away, which is what I should have done.
B004FK528G|4|This shampoo smells just like Herbal Essence I really like the smell it took me back to when I was 15.
B0013522FC|5|I've been using this as a non-drying winter cleanser, with my clarisonic mia2, and I have to say, it's great! My skin has been very clear and not nearly as dry as most winters.
B008CC46VW|5|I get excellent well
B001FWXMGG|5|I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend. She was so excited when she opened it, she already had another bottle but was running out.
B000NSH2L4|5|This product was first given to me by my dermatologist.  It started working on my dry cracked skin as well as some keratosis spots I have.  It has healed my skin and eliminated the raised itchey spots from by back.  It massages right in, is not greasy and is very thick so a small amt goes a long way.  Now even my daughter, who is a nurse, and my husband use it for their dry skin.  The product is worth the cost as it does what it is supposed to do and does not have fragrance that is offensive.  I will order it again and the delivery was prompt.
B00IM69ELA|3|Thin, and the color was light blonde, I dyed them brown tho. I didn't like the clips they came with because they were hard to clip onto hair so I changed the clips. Would recommend to somebody IF they have thin hair, or you'll need two sets of these. Overall okay and satisfied.
B00021DB7Q|5|My wife keeps using my after shave.  When I go to use it, I can see that something has happened!
B00KLV588W|1|ZINC IS NOT INVISIBLE - GOES ON WHITE - AND TAKES AWHILE TO LOOK NATURAL - I RETURNED ITEMS
B00OP273HW|5|I recieved the product as part of a promotion from Head & Shoulders. I tried for free and in return I write reviews. The Head & Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 works great and is the only line in your brand to eliminate dry scalp and embarrassing flakes for my bi-racial Fiance. I would definitely recommend the Moisture Care line for Head & Shoulders to any ethnic hair and for any person with textured or coarse hair. The feel and smell of the Moisture Care 2-in-1 is very fresh and favorable!
B00T8NFRUS|3|I was impressed with quick delivery.<br />Not sure if it works though; not seeing any dramatic changes yet.
B00GP35WPY|5|Love these Headbands!! PERFECT fit, and does not slide off the head! About to order more colors!
B00CCQC4HW|3|The size is good but there are no closures on the side and main pockets.  This is more of a beach bag than a purse.
B00362669I|5|I use this toothpaste alone in the middle of the day to freshen up, however when combined with Supersmile Accelerator it is the only thing that whitens my Tetracycline stained teeth. When I was a young child, I had tonsillitis quite often and was given Tetracycline because it was a widely prescribed antibiotic at that time. Unfortunately If you take this drug while you have your baby teeth, your permanent teeth may develop banding stains ranging from yellow to gray in color, and slight to severe in intensity, plus they may become translucent. My teeth developed slight yellow banding and translucency, and after trying many other bleaching and whitening methods (professional and over-the-counter) to no avail, I tried this and it's worked better than anything else. I've been using the toothpaste with accelerator twice a day for about 3 years and my teeth are brighter and more opaque than they've ever been. I'm very pleased with this system.
B00E20VG48|5|The issues with my skin are a mile long.  I finally made the decision to switch to more natural products.  The process has been hard and extremely expensive.  Thankfully its OVER!!  SEA Lotion works really well on my skin.  I have been extremely pleased with the results.  I usually go through a really bad dry skin phase when the seasons change but not this time.  I'm a fan.
B008HRH3DK|4|Says right on tin &#34;impression&#34; so it's just a copy but I like the scent anyway. Shipped quickly.
B0014C5IRI|1|My product looks as if it has been used I will never purchase again
B00BOJSZNA|5|Great sweet smelling scent at a reasonable price. It's always good to try it first before going for the big bottle.
B00HB2ARDU|5|By far the best trimmer I have ever used. Gets pretty much a clean shave and saves so much time compared to using a regular razor with shaving cream. Definitely worth the price and being able to rinse it off is very nice.
B00736DBV4|1|This pillow absorbs so much water, it is basically like taking your regular pillow in the tub.  Ick.  Also the suction cups tear out unsurprising since the thing weighs a ton when wet.
B002EP9OUG|4|I'm glad that I purchased this item.... It's professional and does the job...
B00275VI7U|2|I was really excited about the scent of this product. I love Benefit, and many of their products. I was very disappointed that the product didn't last long at all. I would prefer to pay a little bit more and have a nice perfume last all day.
B003CH2LDC|5|I have been using this spray for several months now, and am now looking for a refill. I have very fine hair that I prefer to keep blonder than my natural dark blonde. I do have naturally oily hair, but coloring does dry it out. This is the best de-tangler, frizz smoother I have used. I use it daily after showering, right before brushing out my hair. I really feel it allows me to comb through without fighting, and leaves my hair smoother and sleeker all day. This daily along with deep conditioner 2x/week keeps my bleached strands looking healthy and shiny =)
B00GU57Q5G|5|Cleans your pores from all oil and dirt, perfect if used before bed, skin will improve within less than a week, if used with a cleanser for your face.
B005OT24V0|5|DOESN'T MATTER WHICH STYLE OF JEANS YOU PURCHASE FROM SILVER BRAND JEANS,THE SIZE IS ACCURATE DOESN'T VARY LIKE  OTHER JEAN COS.
B003WP8X22|5|Great for purse/wallet.  Handy for cleaning airline seat arms/table tops too.
B004EE2DJY|5|I love novelty labels on everyday items. This stuff is perfect!
B000NGV2RQ|1|when I recieved this product I was very excited.  I really was hoping for the this is it cream, but I was truly dissapointed.  To begin with, it is very oily to my skin and i can tell that there is a lot of chemicals in this \\"fragance free\\" cream.  I felt like I was smelling public pools (my husband felt the same way as I.  I cannot tell you whether this cream works or not because when a applied it for the first time, it felt TERRIBLE on my face that I was discouraged.
B0014P8L9W|5|This product exceeded my expectations... cheap and effective!  I could not believe how my skin felt after only one use.  I will definitely purchase this product again!
B00RSTLZ4Q|1|I revived 1 tiny little sample of this product. The picture shows 2 and says you get 2 but I got 1 & its enough to use 1 time. Total rip off .
B00GCPOP80|1|First of all, I bought it thinking that it was a cream intended for everyday use. But it is not! It is to be used once or twice a week. Second, it completely crumbles on when I try to apply it to my face. I thought maybe it was crumbling because of the Hyaluronic acid I was applying first...so I tried applying to fresh skin... Which did not help. It still crumbled. I also don't like how the sellers have basically no info posted about this product...basically at all. The only reason I bought it was because I love vivo per lei night moisturizer and vit C serum...but this stuff is not worth buying IMO...
B001IXVIUO|5|Bought for my daughter<br />tHIS PRODUCT SOOTHES THE SORE CRACKING SKIN AND EASES PAIN FOR HER.  GLAD I COULD FIND SOME RELIEF FOR HER
B00OBRIVSQ|5|Great natural hand soap.  Will keep buying it.
B001F51Q7K|5|My son loves the flavor and the squeeze tube.  Anything that causes him to brush his teeth longer or more frequently is a winner in my book.  Price seemed really good too, a lot for the money IMHO.  I tried it and will stay with my adult flavors but it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be.  If I could get the cat to use this stuff, I'd be one happy camper.
B00007FCPX|5|It certainly kept the sun from getting through on my face because of the zinc.
B003YFUMME|5|My grandson was so happy to receive this for his 13th birthday. He loves it. He used to use his Dad's. He thanked me so many times that I was s happy as he was.<br />S. Calcagno
B00A2F4BV2|3|I have used this cream before, and I like it. I am 44 years old with dry skin, and this cream is great, the face absorbs it quickly and stay moisturized for long. The smell could be a bit strong for some, but it fades quickly. I tried the other green tea lotion, but it doesn't moisturize my face that good. I am giving it 3 stars because I never received the product. I later realized that it was being shipped from the UK to the USA, and that may have been the issue. My money was returned, which is good. If you plan to buy this cream, check where is going to be shipped from!
B008N5KLGC|4|I like this ionic dryer.  It is good-looking and not to heavy.  It is a good dryer to straighten curly hair (with an ionic brush) and a good dryer when I want to leave my hair curly.  The only problem I have is that I had to search the world over to find a diffuser that fit.
B00NAIM3H2|4|This is a nice product and if used correctly you get a nice even glow.
B002TSA90W|2|I've been a Dove user for several years now. I saw this new Mens brand and picked up the Deep Clean version of this soap without reading every bit of fine print. Embedded in the soap are \\"purifying grains\\" which I didn't realize give this soap a texture closer to Lava soap. That type of soap is fine for dirty hands, but at least for me it's torturous to use this soap on more sensitive parts of the body. Definitely going for the Extra Fresh next time.
B00JZKWO4Q|5|Great product, but a very small bottle. will last about a month
B006L1DNWY|4|My younger was very excited to receive these brushes. She has only used them a few times but so far they have held up well.
B003U8ESI4|5|Amazing, if you have a beard you need one. Best Trimmer on the market
B009VJ0T84|3|5 inch is almost too small.  7 inch is too long.  6 inch would be perfect.  Hope the 7 inich works better as the hair gets longer.
B000P9B3NY|5|love the feel of the lotion it works
B005GPEWKI|5|Great cream but not in the same league as Castle Forbes.
B008UQAX2G|5|Your nails will thank you.<br />Make great gifts too.<br />Kids like the ones with designs on them.<br />Have not conducted a drop test - and would not recommend traveling with these - they are made of glass...
B000052YL1|5|I started using Cuticura when I was 14.  I got into some Poison Ivy & this is what the drugstore told my parents to use.  WOW!  It worked wonderfully on the rash, soothed the itching, & (a nice side efftect) my acne was completely gone.  I have used this soap since then & I am 42 now.  I have been complimented on my skin at Mary Kay & Avon parties.  When they asked what I used I simply replied Cuticura soap; they were not impressed. :-)  Cuticura soap is AMAZING product.
B00D7TWOGY|5|Great product
B00FHB10HY|5|I bought this for my daughter, i was supprised at how good it smelled,<br />It doesent  smell cheap great buy
B007SZCG0C|5|Found this shampoo on my search to strengthen my hair. Whether it's stress, age, or just life, I found my hair falling out and clogging the drain more and more. It's gentle enough to use as a daily shampoo with natural ingredients (caffeine, saw palmetto) to stimulate the follicles. I find my hair thicker in texture, stronger, and I notice I don't lose as many strands. The price is worth it because it works!
B002BWOY5M|5|I like the original hand cream better for hands but this product goes on so much easier on the rest of your dry skin. Takes more applications but does not stain fabric and rubs in well and quickly. Good for night or day use.
B004M7WKKK|4|Covered up bruises and blemishes well and cheaper than most other &#34;famous&#34; concealer palettes. I think it was worth the money
B002V50Z0M|5|I LOVE these bath salts!! I feel so relaxed and energetically cleansed after about 20 minutes soaking in a hot bathtub with these incredible bath salts. They have a lovely scent, and the moldavite essence is powerfully cleansing. Even my husband enjoys them! So it gets 4 thumbs up (from the two of us)! (-;()
B003JN9UR4|5|I just bought it as Sally's and I LOVE IT! It does take time to get the ALL the hairs (I just turned my device in different directions) it does exactly what I want it to do. I used it on my arms and legs. My hair is fine now (it didn't use to be that way) so it was simple to and not so painful for me.
B0006OU06E|5|NICE brush - soft yet durable enough to go thru your hair - my hair is thinning - and my scalp can't take the harshness of a stiff - brush anymore - so I tired these - LOVE THEM &#62;
B0097E9UUG|5|excellent
B000URWZB0|5|What a nice treat to have the scrubber, soap and gentle buffer all in one....Talk about a nice gift too.....my friends think its a real treat to receive this little item as a gift!
B00BDJIUM2|5|Wife loves to use this profuct. And it actually makes my hair look like I have more of it. She likes that too!
B000FKJPE2|5|My baby had eczema so bad she would have a reaction to any cream even those claims to help eczema. And our doctor recommended this and we haven't had a problem since. We use it all over her body and the greatest is that it's not too greasy. We like it a lot.
B004REGO00|1|I used this item for three months exactly as instructed and I did not see ANY benefit from it at all. I contacted the manufacturer to see about any kind of refund and they will not respond. BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.
B001CT09UE|5|I purchase this item for a anniversary present and OMG I love it, this is the original,  no imitation and half of the price, recommend it to all my friends and I will keep purchasing from this vendor!!
B00GYB140E|3|I was expecting more dryness relief.
B001B61JXY|2|I can't personally say how well the ash works compared to any other white ash because this seems like this one is the only one sold on amazon. The package well... IT'S TINY!! Its smaller and about the same thickness of an iphone. I do not understand why it's so expensive. I wasn't expecting a large amount because of the bad reviews already left but wow.
B00FJ7GLH0|4|I was skeptical, as I am 65 and didn't know if I had any active eyebrow follicles after over-plucking as a teen.  It took three months (and the product lasted longer than that for the one tube), applying in the a.m. and before bedtime.  I do notice new growth, and will continue to use.
B003I6O5RC|3|It holds all day and is a great black but it is really clumpy on my lashes. Dont think I will rebuy
B002XQ1YQ8|5|I love this scent. I get a lot of compliments when I wear it. I hate it is so difficult to find.
B004ZZORJG|3|It works pretty well but after a few days turns orange.
B00DUO3DFC|5|What a wonder product. I use in my hair. Awesome!
B00IAK7F1E|5|I love the color and the finish. Usually I can't find a color that suits me, but this one is great!
B00BP4KB5E|4|Like it very much!
B003LGQV6C|5|Great razor handle and I like the way it feels in my hand, has great balance not to mention how great it looks on the stand in my bathroom.  I bought this razor as a treat to myself and I could not be happier.
B00FEZAAWE|5|this perfume is one of the best I've ever bought.
B00080M1OK|4|<br /> <br /> <br />I have been a member of the Essential Skin Care Forum (username - trinalove) for a few months now and joined because I was looking for a skincare product that would actually work, as I was tired of wasting so much money on empty promises of \\"anti-aging\\", etc. It was via this forum that I first heard of Rejuvinol AM/PM.  <br /> <br />After reading so many very enthusiastic recommendations of the Rejuvinol products, I decided to order the AM/PM combo for myself to try. (Just for your info, I am 39 years old with very dry skin and fine lines.)  <br /> <br />Immediately after using the products for the first time, I noticed a firming effect on my skin. Not only that, the products left my terribly dry skin feeling comfortable and not at all irritated. This impressed me enough to buy the other facial products that Dermalogics sells (Lumnaderm and Ocuderm). To my absolute delight, continued use of these products over the last 5 to 6 weeks has made what can only be described as a miraculous difference to my skin all over. Not only is it firm now, but the \\"11\\" lines on my forehead have completely disappeared and my other lines seem to be less noticeable already. My skin is smooth and clear. The red blotchiness I used to have has faded and the very few blemishes I now get are cleared up fast. And this effect lasts! Even if I miss my regime on the occasional evening when I apply fake tan to my face, the improvements are still maintained!  <br /> <br />For the first time in years, I feel comfortable enough with my skin to leave the house without wearing any make-up. I can''t remember the last time it looked this good! My skin glows with health! Because I suffer from a form of arthritis called ankylosing spondylitis, for which I have to take anti-inflammatory medication daily, my skin has suffered in the past - becoming very dry, dull and ashen. Dermalogics's products have made a world of difference to me and given me back a lot of my old confidence. Over the last couple of weeks, people have even been telling me how great my skin''s looking and if I''ve been doing anything different to cause it to look that way. So, of course, I''ve been recommending REjuvinol AM/PM to them all! Thank you for producing such brilliant products. I was a former sceptic about anti-aging skincare, but your company has changed my mind entirely. Dermalogics' products actually work! Your company can certainly count on my loyalty and I shall continue to spread the word about the amazing difference your products can make to skin. I really can''t thank you enough. Please keep up the good work!  <br /> <br />I also have to laugh at some of these other reviews that are written by people who seem to all have the same \\"agenda\\". I wonder if these reviews are from a disgruntled customer or a competing company? Either way they are so bogus its easy to see right through them. Enjoy Everyone!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0046CACQ0|4|I love these! I toss one in my purse whenever I am going to be away for a day or longer. I do wish I like the toothpaste more but it does the trick.
B00H7SDL4A|5|Compact, relatively quiet, fast. No silly cordless nonsense. Made by God-fearing Americans. What's not to like? Just right for the weekly buzz.
B001MA0QY2|5|My hair has a curl that no hot tools straightener could get out, and this one did its job! Very satisfied with this purchase!!
B0030HMQTS|5|I am very impressed, so impressed that I bought the face essentials as well. I have no complaints with this product.
B002Y0IOAM|1|This was not what I was l looking for.  Wanted the tin bandaid cans. Very disappointed in this item. Not what I expected.
B008RODQFM|5|Love it.  I will probably purchase another one!!!
B000TZZEJI|4|This foundation is my all time favorite and it is no longer available anywhere! It leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated from the seaweed, which is an amazing antioxidant. Very nice buildable coverage. I like a sheer finish but I find I can use the Whipped  Foundation version of this as a complementary  cover up . Feels like I have nothing on and looks very natural. My skin feels and look like I have been getting a weekly facial. I also love that it is oil free so it is perfect for these summer months. Buy it while it is still available!
B00BOTTCM8|4|Daughter loves this and I love it because it is safe for her.
B004NZ3D66|1|Take note these are extremely miniature bottles. The formula is goupy and dries very slow. A waste of money.
B00H5A513O|5|GREAT company!!! The first one I got had pretty dull needles that left some scratch marks so I e-mailed them and let them know and made sure I was using it right (because it was my first time). They said because the needles were dull they would send me a new one for free of course and I got it in about 2 days. They made sure I was happy with it and gave me lots of information! The new one works great!!! I use it with vitamin E serum and I'm getting great results for old acne scars!
B0012BSL8O|5|These towelettes are wonderful!  So refreshing, smell lovely, and are a nice size.
B003T1SENM|5|great lotion, my husband is a diabetic and uses it on his feet and legs works great.
B0027SU9JU|5|My daughters blow dryer died the day before she was to start a new job.  I ordered this one for her and she absolutely loves it.  Simple and reasonably priced with the attachment.
B000QUM5LG|3|I had this many years ago and remembered liking it. After having trouble with every other eye makeup remover on the market I purchased this online. It isn't any better than the over the shelf stuff IMHO. I still have to use this, wash my face, use this again and the next mooring, raccoon eyes.
B00EYZY684|4|All of the ladies in my household (all three of them) tried this shampoo and loved the smell of the shampoo. They were not particularly convinced that it &#34;gives weak hair the strength to resist future damage&#34; but that is more a of long-term thing and this is one little 8 ounce bottle. They were impressed with the way it sudsed up and quickly and easily rinsed out and did not feel like their hair was being weighed down at all.
B002BDHGT2|5|Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she seems very happy with it. Nice smelling stuff and looking forward to refilling it at a discounted price!
B00BIAOEFI|4|I do love this color except that in the picture it looks a lot more red and it's really like a hot raspberry pink it's a very beautiful color either way so I would definitely purchase it again
B000TX5UCG|5|This very small radius curling iron barrow captures little whisks of hair perfectly. I don't need to use it often, but when, for some reason, I get a small patch of hair that flattens in the area of my face, this provides the perfect fix.<br /><br />As with any curling iron, it works on heat, so be careful when handling it!
B00IRGVPWG|5|These work great! I tried cheaper ones...bad idea!
B005NIQ2X8|5|Delivered as promised.  Well protected packaging.
B001PHU6TW|5|Great product to control frizz! I put it on my hair after I get out of the shower (I don't rinse it out!)!
B003O7IBZC|5|My son has had eczema since he was a newborn. His doctor gave him some cream for it and suggested that we add Aveeno eczema to it. I have been using this for almost 4 years on him now and it clears up his eczema so quick. I tried using just the cream that the doctor gave and it works but this lotion speeds up the healing process. Whenever he starts itching he goes right to the Aveeno and ask me to put it on. This is a must have product for anyone with eczema.
B00CP4H3T0|5|Why did I ever use a razor?
B006HJOMIO|1|don't even try using this at home even with the correct lite, its a complete mess. I did not bother to return it since i was so mad about the mess they got tossed.
B000C1Z4X0|5|Love this product.Can't find it in stores anymore, so I was very happy when I saw it at Amazon.Thank you.
B007SORR3E|5|I had bought the battery operated one and returned it. The plug in one works much better. There is no weak power from dying batteries and I don't need to charge it. For the first time in years I finally have smooth feet. It's better than getting a pedicare. I now do my own pedicare and save a lot of money!!! Plus, my husband and kids even noticed the difference. I love to rub my &#34;new&#34; smooth feet. I would give this 10 stars!!!!!!!!
B00DDMIVSA|5|we all love this product and plan on purchasing this again but more frequently.
B009SAWDGW|5|I ordered these for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES them! The adjustable headbands are the only way to go for her since traditional ones pinch her behind the ears, and regular elastics are too tight. Great product, delivered fast - thank you!
B00016XJ4M|5|This stuff is AMAZING. After just using it once, my skin looks SO much better! The redness is basically gone, the texture looks way smoother, and it feels clean and hydrated at all times. My skin has a bit of a glow to it now, and just looks really healthy. I couldn't be happier with this product.
B001CS8BJ6|5|EXCELLENT CARE, THE PRODUCT ARRIVED IN TIME SET. I RECOMMEND 100%
B000NHZSKC|5|I was expecting the smaller bottles so I was pleased to see the size of these big boys. It's a deal.  Dispenser works great too.
B005IMHF3U|5|This has been my favorite hair brush for over 30 years. My last one finally wore out. They are extremely durable, and I like how they make my hair look. I was sorry to see that Goody no longer makes them but glad to find them on Amazon. The only thing I don't like is that the tips are sharper than my old one, but they should wear over time.
B002RTJ0JO|4|Ok'
B001OOLLVS|3|The only complaint that I have is that the strips aren't quite what I'm used to. They don't seem to stay on my teeth like the strips I normally buy.<br /><br />They came without a box, which is OK, but I have to wonder if they are some kind of factory reject of some kind......<br /><br />Probably won't want to buy from this vendor again due to this problem.
B008FOT6U8|4|The roses are grate when I tried them they were awesome but are a little big and pops out when ur in a crowd because it is to amazing
B00J7FY9QU|5|The best candles on the market
B002T4UZ5U|3|The Redken high rise hard wax is extremely hard to get out of the container. The wax is a very hard solid. Rubbing the product between your hands takes too long and doesn't work well for me. A little water helps though. Once you get it into your hair though, it holds very well. The smell is decent too. I still need to use it some more to get a complete feel for the product.
B000YZ4MSC|5|This is the best hairspray out there for fine hair. It holds without adding weight and really helps lock in styles, even in humidity. It only takes a little bit to get all day hold. I really love that it has next to no scent, I get so sick of having to open a window everytime I use hairspray.
B002PHN5N0|4|I'm a 56 year old man that has bad plaque psoriasis for years. I have prescription RX as well as over the counter creams and or lotions I use through out much of body. But you can't use some of those RX creams on hands, feet and certain sensitive areas, so I use an over the counter cream, &#34;Upper Canada Soap & Candle All About Feet Soothing Foot Cream&#34;.  I know it's a foot cream, but it's great for my kind of rough hands too. Besides, it's safe on my hands along with the other parts of my body as where some over the counter and prescription lotions/creams can burn, itch or both! As for other areas on my body; I can use the Upper Canada product because you can't just put on RX lotions/creams every time you feel like it, some of them are prescription drugs and overdosing them on the skin isn't a good idea. I've tried so many other over the counter foot and hand lotions/creams over the years until I found &#34;Upper Canada Soap & Candle All About Feet Soothing Foot Cream&#34;. Some times I'll forget how well it works, or I'll think maybe there's something better and check out other creams and lotions again, but I always end up coming back. Thank you so much for your product &#34;Upper Canada Soap & Candle All About Feet Soothing Foot Cream&#34;. As I proof read this I can't help but notice it REALY reads like their spokes person or maybe one of their adds. Nope not so, it just really works and works well!  Thanks again.
B0046XQ75Y|1|Beware: if the item isn't packaged with the Goody label, it's not the real thing!<br /><br />The item received wasn't the Goody brand. It was a poor imitation of the original, which is unfortunate, because I really wanted to replace the pair that I lost. The pins were packaged in a thin, clear plastic bag encased in an ivory mesh bag - clearly not Goody. I don't automatically have a problem with buying imitation products, but these simply weren't well made. I could see and feel that the end points were jagged and not cut smoothly, but attempted to use them anyway. I immediately noticed the difference in quality. They're supposed to glide through your hair when you spin them in, but since the points weren't buffed down properly, you could feel it ripping through instead. I had to return the item, which sounds easy enough. However, one has to still spend time packaging it, going to the post office, and waiting for/following up on the email confirmation that the item was returned successfully to the warehouse and refunded. I have Amazon Prime and this is one of those rare occasions when an order goes wrong. But it's still annoying enough to take the time to write about and to let the company know to not replace the genuine item with generic products. Needless to say, I still need a pair of *Goody* spin pins.
B000YB3RCS|5|I've been using this brush for over a year and it is the gentlest brush I've ever used. I love it. It seems very good on fine hair. I hope it lasts a long long time. It is very well made and still looks brand new. Maybe I should get a spare also...
B00KZHP1GG|1|I don't recommend buying this product.<br />The brush component to mine obviously didn't fit the body.
B005HO0AR2|5|The search goes on and on for products that will do the least damage to my dry skin, especially in the dry, heated New England winter. For some time I used the Clinique extra-dry formulation that costs well over ten bucks per large bar.<br /><br />But then I discovered this unscented Dove. Around here I pay about one-fifty per bar, in packs of four. So I can see that this offer from Amazon makes sense next time I need to replenish. And there WILL be a next time, as I do go through these. Being soft, they disappear more quickly. But that is a small price to pay for a soap that is formulated to not strip all oils out of my poor skin, while leaving me clean. I use it for both shower soap and hand-washing soap and find it totally satisfactory. Thanks, Dove, for omitting the stench (perfume) from this product. Nuthin' wrong with good old clean smelling persons!
B002BU010G|5|I would recommend to everyone, one of the best curling irons I have ever had. Heats up instantly and I feel because of the material of the iron, it doesn't damage your hair as much.
B00K01A4X2|5|I received these 2 items today I like the items wish I've ordered bigger one's.
B00021DZCC|5|Love the scent
B0002Z8OUG|4|When it came, the item was not exactly the same as the picture of their product page, so I was annoyed. But I can file my nails and clean out callous around my fingers, which is great. Unlike others, though, it still leaves thin white strips underneath my nails like other files, only not as much.
B003TZFS9Q|5|I bought this for my grand daughter and she loves it.
B000P27AZ6|5|Love this perfume and cannot find it in any stores. Love it!! I get compliments all the time when I go out,
B004BD0YNK|5|I loved this product this was the first red lipstick Iv'e ever bought and so far It's the only one that I will buy! I think this is better than the MAC's RED! Anybody who want's a TRUE red lipstick...I advise you buy this! The price was just like normal braned lipsticks I bought mine at walgreens... The only down side to this is the SMELL it has this weird old lady perfume smell to it but once its on your lips you can't tell...Plus this shouldn't be used with a lipgloss the lipstick already has tons of moustiuer in it!!!
B004M1BO3U|5|This is a great toothbrush! I ended up returning it ONLY bc target was running a sale, but if you're thinking of getting a Sonicare I'd recommend this model. It's my first electric toothbrush and I think it does everything you want. I used the sensitive mode while my gums were getting used to it and have worked up to the regular setting. I have really sensitive gums and I was surprised at how gentle it actually was. Great purchase that I don't regret. I've had it for a few months now and is still running well.
B001ET7AN6|3|smells great but dries hair out if you use too often
B00A5V8PY2|5|My daughter-in-law has this in our Granddaughters room and it looks like a decoration she has it full of bows!  It is really cute and very well made.  With all the different colored bows on it, it is really very colorful and very hand for Mom to be able to find the bow she wants without having to dig in a drawer for what she is looking for.
B00D0NL2U6|4|surprisingly effective spray at a great price.  I spray my face after applying makeup, and it does help my makeup last a couple of hours longer than it would on its own.  I have oily to combination skin, and the spray helps to keep my skin semi-matte for about 4-6 hours.  however, since I'm looking for products that will help my makeup stay put and matte for 8-10 hours, my hunt continues.
B00021VJCU|5|Excelent quality
B000REOEYM|5|Gets in those hard to reach places when you're trimming your toenails.  Super sharp and easy to use!
B000VEN3RW|5|I bought this Neutralizer to use with Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml by skin laboratory and it always makes my skin feel refreshed. I dab it on my face after I wash my peel off with cold water, then rinse it off and pat day my face. Leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh, and like new.
B000AUIFCA|5|I have used these brush heads for many years. They can be a bit harsh but I love the feeling of clean that these leave behind. I recently tried another toothbrush with different heads and have to say that the Braun toothbrushes and brush heads seem to work better. I noticed that I could not feel plaque along the gum line like I could other brushes.
B000V8MTIC|5|i love it! i put it on the first day took a shower next day my hair was so soft... its amazing
B008EMHBTO|5|I really liked it. The cap lit up the bottle and it glowed longer than I expected. I wish I could've gotten the rest of the colors.
B007PUAFHQ|3|Not particularly long lasting- at least not for me.  Wore off very quickly.  Bought it because it was sold as being long-lasting
B007JAOBYU|5|The name scared me at first, but I ended up loving this tanning bed lotion. It has just enough bronzers in it to give you a nice glow. Now that I have a nice tan I may try the one with 100x bronzers
B0028WG02K|5|This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE hair dryer...I'm a professional hairdresser!   This bad boy is EXTREMELY light weight, powerful, and Ionic!!! I WOULD RECOMEND THIS DRYER TO EVERYONE!!!
B000E7UF8G|4|Be careful, it has a very heavy scent so only use a little bit of it. It will go a long way.
B000BBGS5O|5|Lightweight and blows a lot of air. Great dryer and really fast service. Very happy! What more can I say?
B00BDJCY3S|2|I bought 11 kits of 750 ml, and received 11 kits of 250 ml. Less quantity, different presentation, and different product. I hope it works well, because it was sent to Costa Rica.  I'm really upset, because although it works well, I expected 750 ml in each bottle.
B001GG47LU|5|Loved it!
B002BTZOV8|1|Did not work at all. It was so lightly warm that I was able to have it touch my skin and not burn. The only positive was amazons service and making refunding & returning so simple.
B0000YUXI0|5|I tried everything to get my 3 year old to quit sucking her thumb.  A few days of Mavala Stop and she has no desire to suck her thumb anymore.  Two Thumbs up to Mavala Stop!
B001DKMY9Q|5|After my wife lost the charger for my old pany shaver in a trip, I had to find a replacement. The feedback for this one seemed good, and my experience with this shaver is nice too.<br />Pros:<br />-LED indicator: nice to see how long you take for this shave, and percentage left for the battery;<br />-battery: charge takes one hour which is quicker than my old one, lasted about 45 minutes matching the ads said<br />Cons:<br />-when the shaver reached chin curve, I can feel tiny jitter, I thought it should be smooth transition, not big deal though
B0043RL0SC|5|Excellent
B005N3KQW6|4|The wig was delivered super fast. The material is good. For being my first wig, I think it is great. Not too thick, but you cant see the wig cap which is good. I just need to fix the bangs, and untangle it a bit. It tangles pretty easy, but that is an easy fix. I just need my kitten to stop eating it. -___-
B008U12YV4|5|Great item has many pockets and you could not beat the price. It fits all of my pocketbooks perfect, easy in easy out.
B0068DF82S|5|Love this
B0015Z5BU8|5|I've been looking for a natural conditioner and I am really happy with the Lavender and Avocado Intensive Conditioner. It smells great, and leaves my hair smooth and shiny. It feels good knowing that the conditioner I'm using isn't laden with chemicals, especially since I use it almost every day.<br /><br />The only sad bit is that it IS pricey for only 7 fl oz. My wallet wept a little when I bought both the shampoo (Lavender & Rosemary) and conditioner. I think next time I am going to stick with just the conditioner and use Dr. Bronner for my shampoo...and see what happens.
B00DCF7QW0|5|meet my expectations and more would buy again
B0006GZCVK|3|I really wanted to like this stuff. It left a weird film on my hair, my hair feels drier and the smell is kind of pungent and not in a good way. I know this stuff works well for others but my hair didn't like it.    UPDATE: After going blonde and growing out my hair, I used this on my ends and a mixture of Giovanni Tea Tree Conditioner and V05 on the rest of my hair and I actually liked how much moisture I got. It's not amazing, but it definitely isn't as bad as when my hair was shorter and my natural color.
B00B4KCB7U|4|I have added some blonde highlights to my hair and this is the second John Frieda product I've tried so far.  This shampoo seems like a regular shampoo to me.  Nice scent, not overpowering.  Lathers well but I definitely need conditioner.  I keep my hair about 2-3 inches below my shoulders.  It is fine-medium texture with curls/waves.  I noticed a nice softness to my hair but didn't see a significant change on the highlights.  It is good, but like any other shampoo.  It didn't change the color of my natural hair.  I am ready to go back to brunette and get rid off the highlights since I've had them all summer long.
B000EP7DLU|5|a woman i work with wears this perfume, and i had to find out what it was. i couldn't find it locally, so i searched online. i ordered a sampler for my wife to try, to see if she liked it before i ordered some. she loved it also, so i ordered a small bottle in a red gift box. well after waiting for it to arrive, i opened the package, and the box to inspect it before presenting it to my wife, and suprise! the box was empty.only the dior paper was inside, no perfume. so i called the company who sent it,and explained what happened. they promptly sent out a replacement, and it arrived quickly, and with the perfume this time(i could tell they had opened the plastic bag to verify the perfume was inside). so i could now present it to my wife, and explain what had happened.she wears it quite often, and i never get tired of smelling it.so now i can enjoy it both at home, and at work, as both women wear it frequently. aside from the small glitch with the first order, i am completely satisfied with the product, and seller.try it for yourself!
B004PH3JL6|5|I love the way this spray makes your hair soft. Other brands felt really harsh and dry. This one is more natural.
B0054MSD62|1|Massively dried out my scalp and my head was itching like crazy! My entire scalp felt tight and my forehead above the temples began flaking.<br /><br />I went back to Free & Clear shampoo and conditioner that my dermatologist had recommended.<br />It wasn't getting rid of my dandruff so I switched to the T/Gel, but at least the itching and flaking were considerably less with the Free & Clear.
B000NPYCGU|5|I am so sorry this product is no longer available through Amazon.com, now I'll have to go to Wal-Mart!!!!!!
B001KYVPGI|5|Like it alot
B003HG4VLS|3|Applicator tip is very thin, easy to control. Very smooth application. Created smooth lines with no jagged edges. Pigmentation is very black so it doesn't require any layering for the product to show up. It doesn't feather when you apply it... Unfortunately this eyeliner did smudge on me within the first two hours of wearing it (in the inner corners). It didn't transfer on lids with all day wear, though. I had higher expectations for Nyx, but there's better out there.
B003BQ6QXK|4|I researched shower-ready shaving mirrors and decided against those that came with fog-resistant coatings and required re-application of a coating you had to purchase (and rely on the supply to remain available.)<br /><br />This mirror works on a simple principle, which, in reading some of the negative reviews, some people aren't following.<br /><br /> Behind the mirror is a small reservoir that takes about 3 seconds to fill with warm water in the shower. Fill it up and the mirror will not fog. That simple. It even comes with a squeegee so you can wipe away the water droplets. It's works every time.<br /><br />My only two issues are: a) I wish there was just a tad of magnification on the mirror so you can see your neck &#34;closer&#34;, and b) the mounting stand is quite big, so it takes some room in a small shower. I wish they had designed a way you could hang or mount the mirror itself without using the stand. The squeegee fits fine in the reservoir and my razor already has a home in the shower caddy,<br /><br />Otherwise, this mirror is the real deal and if it doesn't work for you, you didn't read the directions!
B0051CUNEA|4|I don't care for this as a stand-alone foundation.  After about 4 hours, it looks uneven, almost like I have perspired heavily.  I would say my skin is normal skin type, neither dry nor oily.  However, I love it mixed in to any other foundation I buy.  It gives a dewy, luminous look and lasts through a long day.  I used to mix in highlighter products, like Benefit &#34;High Beam&#34;, etc. for this purpose, but I like this even better.  Timewise is a foundation, so the mixed combination is not thinned down.
B006BXUZZA|1|I beg to disagree with all those 5-star ratings...<br /><br />Well, I bought mine from amazon.de when I was in Germany and found a major problem with it immediately. Namely, it was way to easy to turn off the clipper accidentally while using it.<br /><br />In addition, the two-sided attachments are much much clumsier than those of the ER151x series. I found both the ER1511 and ER1512 way superior (I own both versions). Even the older ER153 is better than the the ER1611. Probably the older ER160  is also inferior but I didn't own one of those.<br /><br />Finally, after about a year, the plastic body broke on its own. Some kind of a material fatigue. I bought the necessary replacement parts on amazon.de but, as it turned out, I couldn't take apart the clipper so I couldn't fix it. Authorized service in the US didn't exist and I received an estimate from a repair shop that was way too expensive, almost as much as the clipper itself.<br /><br />In short, IMHO, the ER1611 a piece of mis-engineered and over-engineered piece of junk.<br /><br />OK, I admit the 10K stroke thingie is a nice feature. As I recall the ER151x series does only 6K strokes per minute.<br /><br />Finally, the ER1512 is the king of all clippers (Panasonic or any other band). I can't be more happy than what I already am with it. The ER1511 is essentially the same.<br /><br />P.S. The above is a true story. I still have the ER1611 and the  replacement parts. If Panasonic reads this review and contacts me to send them the pieces for investigating the reason for the breakage, I'll be happy to do so. I will even pay for the postage and Panasonic can keep it. I don't even ask for any compensation and/or replacement.
B005GDAZCE|5|I already love aussie moist, I buy it locally to co-wash my natural hair and to mix in with deep conditioner. I got it on subscribe and save with a 20% discount plus coupon so I almost got 2 bottles for the price of one.
B009SDKWVW|5|Great cutting vest with lots of features, seems a little on the big side like most clothing today.<br />You won't be disappointed.
B0084I2GP2|5|Adds lots of volume without weighing your hair down.  :)
B000VHYLFW|5|As the label says - Eye Pillow.... ahhhhh.  Without doing anything it has a slightly cool feel and so comfortable.  Haven't tried to chill it yet, but all and all I am very happy with it and feels great every night I put it on .....  ahhhhhh....
B002Q4UCGK|5|I use this in a natural insect repellent formula - which can be found online - and I find that it works very well and smells great.  My husband both use it and like the non-chemical alternative to repelling mosquitos and gnats.  I like Aura Cacia oils and will re-order when that time comes.
B006WNCWSM|4|After sorting through hundreds of these purse inserts online, I bought this one because it was the right size and definitely the right price. Ignore all the overpriced versions on Etsy that cost $40+ and get this one! There are a lot of pockets (2x on each inner surface, 1x stretchy pockets on each side, 1x flat pocket on the two outer surfaces, and one wide zippered pocket on the inside. There's also a stretchy band on the inside to help anchor whatever you may need. The inside cloth is thin and soft while the outer panels are very stiff so it maintains a pretty rectangular shape instead of collapsing on itself. This also helps your purse maintain its shape if it otherwise slouches.<br /><br />There are three major reasons that I would recommend this product over others: 1) best price, 2) zippered pocket, 3) many evenly sized pockets. 3) expandable option. I also appreciate that the pockets are made without attempting to predict whatever you want to put in them because I might want to have four pens when there are only two pen slots, but some people might want the different sizes more. A lot of purse inserts don't have a zippered pocket unlike this one; the zippered pocket helps you cart around things you don't want to be visible every time you open up your purse such as pills, contraception, etc. The expandable option is really nice because it not only lets you use it for differently sized purses, but you can also use the insert unexpanded to leave room books or an iPad to the side.<br /><br />The cons are 1) the polyester silky cat print inside which seems cheap to me and 2) lack of smaller pockets. I wish there was at least one smaller pocket, preferably zippered, because sometimes I need a place to store a pair of earrings or something else small that I don't want to lose as it swims around in my cavernous purses.<br /><br />Overall, great product!
B00I6GQX24|5|The product is well received. It could be better if the adaptor able to accept wide voltage range because it designed for travel (portable).
B00DQLAOQ0|4|My complexion is caramel and omg this bronzer allows my skin 2 glow soooooo, the scent is mild and you can use other scents on top with no concern.<br /><br />I like it 110%<br /><br />Oh the glitter is not heavy,  mild and nicely transparent.
B000EUFDB2|5|This tool is one I would not want to be without!  I have trouble bending, and the design of this spoon foot file takes most of the effort out of reaching those callous areas on my feet. Plus it does a wonderful job of smoothing callous areas without tearing the skin like rougher foot files do.  I bought three even though the one I have still works well for me.  I just can't always find them, and I never want to be without one again!
B003V3476G|5|very nice deal on this philpis shaver.I recommend it to everyone who might need an electronic shaver!It moves pretty smothly and also in a gentle way.
B006VWVDL6|5|Tried these the day I got them and I was pleasantly surprised that they indeed tasted wonderful (I love rosewater and it tastes very similar) and worked great too.  My skin didn't start smelling like roses until about 4-5 hours after I had eaten the recommended amount.  But when it did, it was light and airy and very nice.  My husband loved it!
B00DWKRHNS|5|NICE
B00PYK2UI6|5|This is the first scrubber I ever tried and see how it would make a very very nice gift for anyone!  The quality is very good.  I was surprised I would like it as much as I did.  Definitely a great buy and not as expensive as the others.  Fits well in hand.  Just kinda hard getting off the bottom to install batteries.  Still, gets an easy 5 stars because how good it feels.<br /><br />Update:  5/15<br />Just want to say ... I STILL LOVE IT!  Ive read a few of the questions and I have never had it stop when applying moderate pressure at all.  I used the small heavy bristle with a peach scrub and Im glowing.  So fresh and clean!  I even love the box!  Its sturdy, easy to keep everything in.  Brushes are holding up thus so far and keep there form.  This WILL make the holiday gift list for every female member.<br /><br />Ill do another up date in a few months, I dont think anything will change except the batteries getting recharged.  lol
B008GOR6O0|5|I love this product. Went on my face smoothly and was easy to blend. For the price its def worth buying. I plan on purchasing this again!!!
B002HWS9FW|5|We have an Oral-B rechargeabke toothbrush at home, but it is inconvenient to bring along when we travel -- especially to countries with different voltage.  This battery-operated toothbrush solves the problem.  It is lightweight, does a good job on our teeth and is quite inexpensive.
B00CFD2PRQ|5|Exactly the same product as I got in Hawaii.  What's perfect too is that I poured half of it into the fancy bottle that I originally had when I bought in Hawaii, and the remainder of the perfume in this bottle travels with me, so I don't need to bring the bulky bottle.
B000EMYJ88|5|Every makeup bag and first aid kit should have a pair of TWEEZERMAN SLANT TWEEZERS! Excellent for keeping brows clean between waxing. Brush the brows in the opposite direction of the hair growth then slide right under the hair with the TWEEZERMAN SLANT TWEEZER clasp down and pull right out! Painless and clean!!
B00FRDPNA2|5|This may be the silkiest conditioner I've ever used! For the price, I love it!
B0019ZSAUM|4|I have been plagued by mild to moderate acne, mainly around my neck and chin area for sometime (I am 57 years old-not a teenager).  The problem has been serious enough that I had to seek the help of a dermatologist some months ago, as things just went out of control and, with his help, the situation got better.    I was looking for something to control my problem without drugs or medications, mostly because my problem normally isn't that bad.  I have been using the Zune for a couple of weeks now and it seems to be just the ticket for \\"nipping things in the bud\\".  At the first sign of a zit I use the device once or twice and they go away within about a day.  At this point I'm optimistic that I've found what I've been looking for.  Time will tell.
B00GSYFC50|5|Beautiful. A small amount lasts into the next day for me. Definite rose scent.
B00620NB0I|5|These gloves are awesome!  I don't feel any heat through them when taking pans out of the oven! I would highly recommend.
B008BHO53M|5|Very nice trimmers
B009LOJ5MA|5|I was dubious at first when we purchased it but within weeks I noticed a drastic change in my gf's legs as well as her confidence. As an added bonus it doesn't leave her skin greasy or leave any bad lingering odors. Overall, her thighs look less dimply and smoother. This product delivers as promised. Now she wants to go to the beach to show off her body. Thanks for a great product.
B004RR6NDU|5|A must for my hair!  Tames those frizzies and my naturally curly hair!  Leaves my hair shiny, soft and smooth after styling and straightening!!
B00390DN34|5|I am a long time user of baby powder to get rid of oily hair near the root. This product is AMAZING in comparison. I will never go back!! A lot of reviews talked about the way it made their roots feel gummy or sticky. I have no idea what they are talking about. My roots felt so much better at the end of the day then how baby powder makes your hair feel. I couldn't believe the amount of volume it gave my thin, long hair as well. Baby powder will give your hair sort of a matte look, this did not. It covered the oils but made my hair look like it still had that healthy shine if that makes sense. Give it a try!
B00H51NMEI|1|Wasn't very happy. Item received not in original package, brush was in the tube, it just seems that it was sold to me used, there was no seal either, it had definitely been opened
B00BPORSKU|5|Bought this for a friend ( I have the Magenta one ) and asked her how it worked for her.  She said she went to work and everyone started complimenting her on her new hair color !  I would reccomend this product to anyone.
B001OMEHM0|5|I have naturally curly/wavy hair. When I let my hair air dry I put this in and it's nice and soft and frizz no more!
B002KAO7RA|5|Having dry-mouth due to having had radiation, I found the Biotene products.  I didn't expect to find a product that my dental hygienist who be happy I was \\"using\\".  Not only does this gum assist with \\"dry-mouth\\" problems, but it also does what it says it will do and that is, it helps with tartar control.  The dental hygienist was exstatic, she had so little to do, I was happy!  Great gum and it tastes good too, (sour apple)!
B0049J459A|2|Description says &#34;6 per box&#34; so I ordered 2 and I thought I would receive 12 tooth brushes total but I only received 2.
B002WJOOIQ|3|Didn't  tan like I expected.
B008PYO6TO|4|Wasn't the color I expected but they were really awesome and returned the polish and exchanged it for the color I wanted! Great customer service and it shipped super fast! Within 2 days!!
B0084BPHIM|5|I visited my local nail store only to find the identical item was way too much money. Finding them here was a blessing for my pocket book not to mention they work just as good as those pricey ones in my local nail store. I will continue to order from this supplier via Amazon. I actually got my product sooner than I was advised.
B000YZGP4G|5|\\"Awesome - love it,\\" says my wife. Motions foaming wrap lotion holds your style without a greasy or gelled look. If you want a drier look, you can simply run your hands through it and you won't have a shiny look, but it will still hold your style and not get frizzy. It's light and doesn't weigh down your curl, but has great hold. If you desire a shinier look you can add more. This has been a popular product among the females in our home. \\"Get more,\\" they tell me, \\"get more.\\" That's about as high of an endorsement as they offer.
B00PJYQ8JO|5|I have used this mask for just a few weeks and wish I would have known about this product years ago. It is absolutely the BEST invention for skin care out there. At $1/day (yes you can purchase this mask at Target for $30) it is very economical. The results are amazing. My skin tone has improved. The fine lines around my eyes have diminished. I wish I could attach my personal before and after pictures here. It's so easy to use. You open the box, pull out the mask, put it on like a pair of sunglasses and press the on button. The lights are not bothersome at all. It is quite relaxing. Fifteen minutes of &#34;me&#34; time each night before I go to bed that produces great results - what more can you ask for? Definitely a product I will purchase again and again.
B00IGGYAH4|5|Hard to find this color at local drug stores.  Husband is happy that he can rely on this product.
B003VZPTAC|5|Used Taylor's Almond and it was the best shaving cream I had ever used, but the Jermyn Street is even better. I use an american-made Classical Element DE razor. The scent is subtle and not overpowering. I only wish Taylor of Old Bond made an unscented shaving cream.
B000C21AC8|5|I was very impressed at how quickly I was able to order Android receive a product that I have not seen at any store in ages. It was great to have it back on my dresser. If anyone is looking fot a nice inexpensive fragrance try Fire & Ice by revlon
B00ZR4RK84|5|I am in love with this brush omg ...it glides onto the skin distributing the foundation effortlessly...omg omg loveeeeee wish it came as a set ..worth the money
B00021E2GA|1|Heated eye last curler is not worth the expensive price ! Will be returning the item.
B001BEIZAQ|5|perfect
B005P0U762|1|Truly horrible tasting.  We tried in water and juice--both were horrible and certainly not citrus tasting.  I'm hoping this company will come up with a pill formula of this.
B00DEC3I7S|5|I love this product, the natural scent is light and refreshing.  The lotion is not at all greasy and it absorbs well into the skin.  It keeps your skin feeling nice and soft.  An excellent product.
B002GZN18K|1|I dont think its my body chemistry because I found other reviews saying the same-- it smells like wet dog!  I got this in a 4 pack (of one ounce bottles)... obviously i thought it was a great deal but when i got to this one, it was absolutely disgusting. i encourage everyone thinking of buying this to first go to a store and test it out  before they buy... maybe it has something to do with my body's chemistry?
B000UY81H0|5|I've used a lot of exfoliant/cleansers in my time but this has to be the absolute best.  It is expensive but does last a very long time.  I must say when I first bought it and discovered it was a powder (to which you add water) I was very skeptical however it is absolutely fantastic!
B001AJ6YS2|5|Works great good price
B002LPAFRA|5|Works well..
B00Q3C5CB6|5|whiten my grey hair each weekly wash.
B00GMKSW98|5|love these products
B00AC2QUP0|5|ORIGINAL FRAGRANCE<br />VERY PLEASED
B004BD107O|5|I have used this mascara for years-and it's always performed beautifully.  If what you seek is lengthening, this is the one. Also adds volume, but not *heavy* thickening. No clumping, and I have never had raccoon eyes at the end of the day. Great colors and washes off easily. I use a little cold cream with a tissue when necessary. I will never switch, and I've tried most of the top rated Sephora/Department store brand on the market over the years--I just got tired of spending all that money. It's just not necessary. L'Oreal makes high quality mascara. This is my go-to, but they have others that are excellent as well if you seek more volumizing.
B004JK1NIA|4|Bought this for my husband who's a barber and he loves it. Kinda flimsy material but good for the price
B001W7XT08|5|Best after shower body oil.  Originally found in Hawaii - so happy I could find it here!
B005WKM8OY|5|I was Santa on a few occasions and the spray added just the right touches to my beard.<br />It looks natural unlike some other products and, as the children were pleased, I was, too.<br />Delivery was prompt and the price was right.
B004X8K93S|5|I use this every night and after every shower and so far not a single stretch mark. I'm 21 weeks pregnant and had a very flat stomach going into pregnancy. My mom has stretch marks, so I thought it was inevitable for me, but so far this cream seems to be working.
B000HX6JT6|5|I used Cellex-C years ago and had exceptional results.  I stopped using it and that is my biggest regret.<br />I recommend it to everyone who wants a youthful, healthy skin.....at any age.<br />Thank You Cellex-C
B00188D8LG|2|I bought this lacquer as a gift for my wife.  She tried it and said that the poor quality of varnish, inconvenient brush and paint the nails as shown in advertising \\"easily and naturally\\" - does not work.  It is a pity, because the delivery of four sticks cost me anout 45 dollars. In two times more than goods.
B002NLN11Y|5|This is a superb soap, with a pleasant fragrance. Extremely helpful for sensitive skin. Have even used it on my face with great results. Smooth, hydrating to the skin. Theraputic for us at least. Got it as a gift. Hope to get more.
B000RIJ3GM|1|I have ordered this product several times from amazon. This time the product was definitely old when I got it. It is very thick and doesn't smell fresh. Very disappointing
B0047E3LHE|5|Goodbye, Mach 3! Goodbye irritation and nicks on my face. This razor has changed EVERYTHING about how I shave my face! It just GLIDED right over my face, picking up every hair! And this is even over 1 week without shaving! You don't even need shaving cream! I just wanna scream how great this is! This wasn't even any irritation when shaving my upper lip! My Mach 3 used to just tug and pull those hairs out, painfully. These 5 blades offer a closer shave without any cuts on my face! And the extra large lubrication strip? Genius! Sorry for all the exclamation points, but this product is truly this great! GO BUY IT!!
B000RZPVV6|5|my wife loves this stuff and swears by it... although she can be a bit of a fanatic about all this &#34;healthy alternative&#34; trendy stuff... she puts it on every time she gets out of the shower or the tub and the dogs get really excited and always try to lick it off of her so apparently they like it too.<br /><br />I tried it myself but im not really into walking around all oily when id rather just be dry... it didnt seem to work any better than regular old body lotion.
B00CMJD43C|5|A friend I just met who is an older actress recommended this to me. She looks GREAT!! I have been using it for two weeks and can already see a difference. Your skin just drinks it up. Non drying!! I love it!
B00IAQV9RE|4|I love beanies but as far as what I was expecting it didn't quite live up to my expectations, although I am still very pleased with my purchase, I just expected more slouch less beret.
B009WS6N0C|5|These have changed my life! I can throw up my hair in a perfect bun wet or dry and be out the door quick!
B004W2OQPC|5|just as advertised, but quality was even better! thank you
B005V3AV5U|5|The little samples are fun to play with and even though they are small it goes a long way. This way I will know what to order, later
B000FQ5NNI|5|I've been using brush picks (interdental picks) for three or four years.  I've tried lots of different brands, and this is my new favorite.  One end has a triangular shaped pick, similar to the wooden Stim-u-Dent, which is great for using as a regular toothpick.  The other end is the thinnest brush pick I've ever used, great for tight spaces.  I keep this small dispenser in my purse, and have a big package in the bathroom.  Love them.
B0001B433I|5|These clippers are a barber's go-to.  Bought these as a spare when my other ones get too hot.
B00IQMRHR8|5|Good quality, I wear a lot of wigs.
B000E7UDWO|5|my wife has been looking at this for a while so I got it for her as a surprise... she loves it!
B001159UMM|5|Cuts shaving time in half with sharper blades  ans screen.
B00336EUSG|5|I purchased the CREST 3d WHITE toothpaste right after I saw the commercial on TV.  I figured I would give it a shot and if it did not work, I can write a negative review.  Can I just tell you that this toothpaste not only works but it leaves your mouth tingling for hours as if you have used a mouthwash. I gave the toothpaste one full tube to start working and by the second week of using the toothpaste, EVERYONE started noticing my whiter teeth. Needless to say, by the end of the complete tube, my teeth were better than white. I just LOVE it! I have recommended this product to my co-workers, friends and family. After they try it, they can't stop talking about it.  This is truly an easy and inexpensive way to brighten your teeth. This is better than a dentist's office whitener. You have to brush your teeth daily right? So why not brighten them at the same time while you brush your teeth? The difference between this product and any other teeth whitener is that you are brightening EVERY tooth, inside and out, left and right, top and bottom, wherever that toothbrush goes. So your teeth are evenly white. I can't say enough about this product. It works and I highly recommend it!
B007IM3RZI|4|At first my daughter loved this stuff but now it seems to be making her hair oilier. Will use less conditioner to see if that helps.
B003A88KDS|1|coworkers said i was sick when I wore this lipcolor. Would never buy this color again.<br />Also, it dries my lips out like desert. Would not return it since I have already used it. Just went to trash can.
B00371PJ1E|1|Giving a 1 star because I had an allergic reaction to it after using it for about a week.  I was on the 2nd bar when I noticed red dots all over my body.  They weren't itchy but they were bright red dots everywhere.  The soap was the only thing different that I used.  I stopped using it and the dots disappeared after about 3 days.
B00BSG5YUG|5|Color was exactly what I had expected it to be! The only thing is that I did a bit of research before actually buying the several Gelish nail polishes that I ordered. Sometimes the picture from the bottle does not do the color any justice. Some GREAT advice I think is when you are looking at some colors, type the name of the nail polish into Google Images and see the different pictures that people posted with the actual nail polish on their nails since that can often come out looking a bit different. After doing my research I knew this color would be exactly what I wanted and it was. Gelish brand does not disappoint and it pays for itself after a couple of uses.
B00CS7TK7C|5|Love it as I do all the wet brush products this paddle style is great for long hair👍🏻
B001BBU0O8|5|My teenage daughter uses this and it has helped her skin.  Much gentler than the acne washes but seems to keep acne away.
B002VDK21G|5|works !
B0000536M2|5|I was having trouble finding this great mascara in local stores.  So happy to find I could get it from Amazon! So convenient! Now I can again use this product that doesn't turn my lashes into caked-up clumps just makes them darker and more visible.  It is also easy to remove.
B00FRZ1DS6|5|Another great product.  Seeing results overnight.  Wear a sunscreen by day.
B00DYXW0QC|5|My husband loves this stuff.  This particular one is very hard to find in our area.  It does a great job!
B000F63TW0|2|Too sticky.
B00116W1MC|5|I have loved Dr. Bronners soap since I was a teenager.  It's healthy and biodegradable, and its made from plants instead of petroleum.  My only complaint with this order is that when my gallon bottle was packed, they used too small of a box and bent the spout of the bottle to fit it in, so I lose some each time I pour it.
B005H1541C|5|This has been a very dry, cold winter and my face has been so dry and flaky. Nothing has helped, but after I wash my face I put this on and my skin just soaks this up like a sponge. My skin looks renewed, alive! It is wonderful. I am a young looking 66.. but I was looking old and I was molting! People are now telling me I look like I am in my late 40's, early 50's again. Yup, this product is GOOD!!
B0001EKU28|5|Really like the way it makes my face feel after use.  Just  have to remember to use it twice  a week.<br />Will buy again.
B00KYWDP1A|5|Very nice ballet
B006POOQ1E|5|Best eye creme EVER for me....Gentle and does the trick for the eye area...Try it....you will love it....always have a tube also in gym bag.....
B003CTTZQQ|5|Best product to grow my hair
B00ABB7S7Q|5|I have not got these and my hair is pretty normal thickness but how many packs would I need??? Please respond ASAP!!!!
B00FULYKG4|5|My husband loved this! He said it works great!!!
B0098OSJCU|4|this worked much better than soaking in a bowl of acetone. better for my skin. i would recommend it highly
B003ATP6XY|3|I have worn this quick weave over and over for years, then it went out of stock.  The texture has changed over the years, but the curl effect is the same.  It is  to find who has it. very hard to find now.  I usually Google to find who has it.  I would rate it a five if I could find more.  But again the texture changed too.  I do love it.  .
B005J8GKDO|4|Smelled good, the shipping seemed a bit excessive but the product was good.
B003723PKU|5|My cleaning lady demanded that I quit using bar soap because it is hard to clean \\"just use soft soap body wash\\" she dictated....  Found this info on the web and sharing...  \\"Many people have soap residue problems that can make cleaning extra difficult. To solve this problem -- buy new soap. \\"Soap residue problems come from the animal fat and lye that is in most bar soap. Switch to a glycerin-based bar soap, and you'll take even more time out of cleaning the bathroom.\\"\\"
B001B27CVQ|5|Love it! Not sure if it was totally worth the price but it works really well and its uber sharp! i felt like splurging since this is supposedly near the top of the tweezer market.
B008LDFU26|2|I've been in the Beauty Industry for years and this product does not impress me.<br />Sticky and the results are temporary.Seems like a sales program to me.
B000VUZ0PY|4|The card and the information is great, and nearly everything needed is on the card. The drawback is the size. It is very small to have all this information.  I am happy with the card, just not the small size.
B000LUXNV2|5|Awesome lotion
B00EUFKVQE|1|Broke down after 5 days.
B00CHFWRSE|4|Very thick liquid, goes on cute though
B00J4F48V4|4|A little heaver than expected
B005HIH8LE|1|Received item and it was half empty!!
B003607ZNG|4|Personally, St. Ive's Apricot Scrub does a better job exfoliating my face, however I do like that this product is pretty much all natural and my face does feel more refreshed after using. One piece of advice I would give is to use this as often as they recommend (2x/week) and not any more. Over exfoliating can lead to more problems than solutions.
B00EP2P3ME|4|I never realized it was my scalp causing the problems with my thinning hair until this treatment came along and cleansed away all the dirt and debris that had built up from years of damage and products on my scalp. Within a few weeks it was totally flake free and once my scalp could breathe it was only a matter of time before the hairs coming in improved as a result.
B00122N85Y|4|My name is Olivia and I am 11 years old. I am writing this review for my mom because I am the one using this product. I got this product because my hair is oily. I swim 4 times a week so the ends of my hair get very dry but my scalp remains oily. After using this shampoo my hair is still dry on the ends but my scalp and hair is no longer oily when used daily. If I skip a day, my hair is oily again. My hair feels soft and looks smooth. The shampoo is lightly scented, like aloe and apple, not overly fragrant, like old-lady perfume.  I am rating this shampoo 4 stars as the ingredients are not organic, but would rate it 5 stars for best choice for being non organic ingredients. I would buy it again. My mom purchases this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save program.
B008BA80H6|5|just what I needed, worked great
B003V27RB4|4|I have very course and wavy shoulder length hair and I got this to try to smooth out the super frizz I get first thing in the AM. I'm not very good with styling my hair and I thought this would make it effortless but it's very difficult to not make it look like something out of the 70's. Currently use this as a towel warmer.
B003AXXX5S|5|Used this product before and found it does the trick.
B000O7JK0A|5|My daughter used it at camp and she didn't come back with lice.  Not to say she would have come back with lice if she hadn't used it.  There you have it.
B00AL14SO2|5|love these!!! i never know anything like these existed. saw them while i was browsing on amazon for some new electric toothbrush heads. these are awesome, i thought they'd be painful but they are not. i was going to go for some other metal ones but thought the plastic might be safer to use. awesome, i don't know how my mouth lived without them. breath is fresh and tongue is pink.
B0010MA2M8|5|I find these great for eyebrows (be careful not to take too much off though) as well as stray hairs elsewhere.  I keep one with me and one by my bed.
B00KD73PBQ|3|Don't like the smell.
B0000530LP|5|great! would order thru them again. item arrived very quickly and without any damage. thanks again for the wonderful service
B001FB5HGK|4|I was extremely happy when i received this three pack. I can not believe that the product was way bigger in person then perceived in the picture. It smells great and it doesn't sting my skin like lots of other toners. I am very happy with this product.
B00D62M76Y|2|I was super excited to receive this hookah. It had awesome review's which is always a plus for any buyer. Unfortunately my hookah arrived with a broken base. I contacted amazon for full refund.  Albeit I definitely intend on buying this hookah again. Besides the broken base the actual hookah was beautiful!!!!!!!! Just wish the seller would have doubled wrapped it. One thin layer of wrap vs NYC mail carriers means the hookah had no chance of arriveing in ONE piece. WILL DEF UPDATE THIS AFTER THE NEW ONE ARRIVES AND I CAN ACTUALLY USE IT.
B005F5J5Z6|3|I got this thinking it wouldn't sting my eyes, but it does more so than my cheapie Neutrogena brand one. it does, however, glide on smoothly and sink into the skin so it doesn't feel like I have anything on my face. I will use it in winter when I sweat less so there's less chance of it ending up in my eyes.
B000050B75|5|One haircut for my husband, another for my son, and the set was paid for.  Not too loud, either.  Lots of combs, clips and even a nice pair of scissors make this set an incredible value. <br /> <br />As described in other reviews, my first set was also biting.  I tried to adjust the blades to avoid this, and found that the white plastic piece that holds the second, inner blade was not installed at an angle, which made it impossible for the two blades to align.  Because it was more than 30 days since I received the set, I returned in directly to Wahl, who VERY promptly sent me a replacement set that is perfect.
B000PXYCHE|5|My old one gave up on me after faithfully working well all over the worl for 14 years! This new version is lighter and even quieter. I wish it would come with a travel case though. I hope it will keep blowing my hair for a long time as the old one did.
B00N06OT26|5|Great service!  Product is as described!
B000FZEPYW|3|If you have an afternoon to spare and a lot of patience this works. It takes time since the wax isn't as strong as commercial wax used in salons. Bottle is tiny and difficult to manipulate.
B00ERPI2CW|1|I'm very surprised Amazon still sells this. I have written a bad review before and I read others' bad experiences. Now I find none of those comments here. Since I have no thyroid gland, I have to take T3 (which is not available where I live)and T4 (which is readily and cheaply available here). In every country I've lived, T3 requires a doctor's prescription. It's very dangerous to self administer without getting lab blood tests to monitor the amount. I don't know how they can sell this drug in the US without requiring a doctor's prescription. And to advertise it as a weight loss pill or to build muscle is absolutely false advertising. I ordered this and they sent me the cheaper T4, which I can buy here for 1/4 the price they charge. It was just a scam - or \\"bait and switch\\" scheme.
B000VOHCO2|5|I have worn this scent before.  Everything was great.  I received the purchase about 2 days after I ordered.  I would definitely order it again.
B00ARKH0UQ|5|Worked really well! I actually used shampoo to rinse it out, but the color still turned out extremely well and exactly how I wanted it to.
B00NBCD7MW|5|I was asked to try the new 3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora since I have such fine, thin lashes I of course jumped at the chance.<br />Nestled in a black box are two silver tubes. One tube of Magnifying Gel and one tube of Natural Fiber Lashes.<br />Starting with the box, it’s a great box with a magnet that keeps the box closed. The tubes are also inside a satin cut out. But the best part is the fact that the instructions are clearly printed on the inside lid. That was very helpful for me.<br />Mia Adora recommends that you apply the product one eye at a time. The first step is to apply the Magnifying Gel from base of your lashes to top; 15-20 strokes. The Magnifying Gel looks like regular mascara except this gel separates your lashes and primes them for the Natural Fibers Lashes. The Natural Fiber Lashes looks like black lint stuck to a mascara wand. These are your fibers.<br />While the Magnifying Gel is still wet, apply 10-15 strokes of the Natural Fiber Lashes from mid-lash to the top. Wait for 20 seconds for the fibers to dry. Then apply another 15-20 strokes of the Magnifying Gel. This step locks the fibers in place.<br />I was impressed with my finished look and with just one full coat (all three steps equals one coat) I am thrilled with how full my lashes look. My lashes are longer, fuller and full of volume. I’m quite pleased!<br />You can add 2 or even 3 coats for more of a dramatic look.<br />I wear contact lenses and I had no problem using this 3D Fiber Lash Mascara. I experienced no flakes or smudges either!!<br />More to love is the fact that you can start your base coat with your own mascara for an even more dramatic look. Made with 100% Green Tea, Paraben and SLS Free. 3D Fibers from Mia Adora is never tested on animals.<br />Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. I did not receive cash payment to write this review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe in.s, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe in.
B00GDKBUDM|4|It can definitely streak but the color is great.
B00016XJ4M|4|Nice product, and love the smell of roses!  I use it daily before makeup, and after cleansing my skin.  Good price also.
B00BWRLJ6O|5|Absolutely love this shaver. Gets a a nice close shave with little to no irrational. My neck usually gets bad razor burn and was lucky if I could shave twice a week without it being very painful. I can shave every day with the shaver easily. Never thought it'd be possible.
B004OHQR1Q|5|I love the dotting pen because I have been able to do my nails in so many ways thanks to this dotter. Absolutely beautiful!!!
B00DPE9EQO|5|Very good serum
B0010Y1KYA|5|Everything is great except the soap. I recamened getting a different soap. The one it comes with dosnt lather well and dosnt smell great. Also I had to get use the the brush it sheds and has the wet fur smell but it's works great.
B007HCDUKG|5|This is the 4th reorder of the bodywash.  My wife loves it and prefers it over anything else.  Happy wife, happy life.
B00F2ZAK2Q|5|Why people said it is faked???<br />It is authentic! Great deal!
B00JUJ1B82|5|Fluoride is a near toxin.  It can create all kinds of behavior and academic dysfunctions.  If you have fluoride in your drinking water, please please research this.  Did you know on the back of fluoride toothpaste it says if ingested call poison control?  O  M  G.  So not appropriate for anyone who cannot spit appropriately, ESPECIALLY our children!
B0012BNVE8|4|1.I bought this product after a friend recommended it to me because it worked for him, so I started using it one month ago and it looks like it is starting to work.  2. Now I'm writing this review about 3 months later of the 1st one, I can see the difference in my hair and its definitely working for me, yes it takes time and its relatively slow, but it works. consistency in using the product is very important to see the results.
B0059NL39U|5|This goes on very smoothly, leaves no trace, I am east asian with very fair skin and this blends in perfectly(I use dior 001 ivory), so if you are more tanned this might not work for you. This cream hides blemishes very well, but it have low coverage so its probably only good for spot treatment instead of using it on the whole face. I only use this to cover blemishes around nose and chin area, and some veins on my cheek, it looks like i have no make up on and my face is flawless. I have combination skin, and this cream becomes oily after about 7-8 hours, it have spf but I wouldn't count on that for uv protection, it is not matte, but not shiny either. The bottle size is about the length of my palm(without the cap), so if you use very frequently or cover large areas I can see it run out very fast.
B0084A72SG|5|I use this shade as the bronzer to add contour.
B00538TSMU|5|Good price, good lashes. Definitely recommended on if you're looking to save money and look fabulous!
B00M21V4FU|5|I love it, it works well, very light  and no smell
B000IF3D38|3|Works just fine.  I wish I had ordered a \\"cord-keeper\\" blow dryer, but that's my fault.    In terms of the color, it is white and black and not silver.  At least mine was.
B0007YX9K2|4|This fork design has made eating easier for my 92 year old father.  The metal fork tends to twist a bit.  Am going to try using some super glue to stabilize the fork to the handle.
B000B9L68U|5|love it
B000NL0T1G|5|Well built has some good weight to it, was easy to use and assemble. Not sure about the blade that came with it seemed a bit dull for shaving. Maybe order some different blades for it.
B000V0X61O|5|My order was delivered on time, very happy with the purchase.
B00IRLX1X2|3|It's a very nice cream, but too thick for me. I'm in love with their serum. Best I've ever used.
B005SRJ9MK|5|This is an awsome product.  I use it in the evening before using retinol 1% with tretoin.  This bar is so mild and gentle...and great for all skin types, especially sensitive skin.  Leaves skin so soft with no irritaion....just a good gentle cleanse....and lasts a long time.  I plan to order more to use on my body in shower.  Just love this bar.
B0038BD2H6|1|I ordered this on Amazon instead of purchasing it from Sephora as usual because of the convenience and because it was a few dollars cheaper.<br /><br />I have been using this for 10 days.  The jar is almost identical to my old (real) one, but the font is slightly different.  Enough to wonder about.  The product (Fairly Light) is SIGNIFICANTLY lighter than my last container.  I know Bare Escentuals would not have changed the tones of their product this much over a few months.  I have to layer on bronzer afterwards in order to even out the tone of my skin since it's so light.<br /><br />The worst part is that my skin has been getting worse and worse over the last week with terrible breakouts and I finally realized that it is probably because of this fake product.  After reading other reviews from customers who purchased through baremakeup4less, I see similar complaints.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  It is fake, terrible for your skin, and I am shocked that Amazon is carrying it.
B00005A441|5|Gift for a daughter who loves these and her curls last for days!
B00GWF4AS0|5|Great toner, high quality product.
B004HSO124|5|My 13 year old daughter likes to experiment with fun and unique make up styles. These, she LOVES!!! Not just fun, but good quality and vibrant colors.
B00ID8TUXO|5|Nice to have extras of these. Doesn't work well in the heat if you sweat. Otherwise stick well, and can be reused a few times before needing new ones.
B000WMK5WO|5|IS Clinical Active serum does it all- it's anti-acneic so it helps with breakouts and it's anti-aging.  Active serum smoothes your skin, helps with pigmentation and gently exfoliates your skin as it works.  I can't live without this stuff.  It costs a little much, but one bottle lasts for 3 months at least.  Active serum will replace any other nighttime treatment you may already have at home.

B00N52SSJK|4|I'm not sure if this product works because I just began to use it but I love the package design it's really cute ^-^
B000AA5VD6|5|Tried all the high end top coats and by far this has been the best! I use a mini fan and allow 3 mins drying time between coats and then give a good 7-10 mins after applying this topcoat and my nails never smear or smudge. Polish doesn't chip until my next mani( usually 5 days). Definitely recommend.
B003NYI9OY|4|It's a great color, but I need three coats next time.  I'm happy that I was able to find it on Amazon.
B002ZNJI80|5|Great product for practicing braids. She sheds a lot but this is normal with mannequins. I love the hair texture. I will purchase more
B004GEXU5S|5|I started getting adult acne for the first time in my life. I tried some over the counter products and nothing worked. Once I started using this product every day and night I could see a dramatic improvement. I have been using it now for 2 months and it's amazing how smooth my skin is now. Be patient and give this product time to work. I just bought my 2nd tube because I believe in it.
B007XJ38J6|5|My wife totally finds this product, one of the best on the market.  She has no complaints about how long the cover up lasts.  So far so good.
B00OBVUDBA|5|Love my daughter's snow white bow! Will be perfect for her 1st Halloween!!
B0017JT658|4|i bought this to see if i would enjoy the smell. it was tiny but worth purchasing a sample prior to a full bottle
B00028QFAY|5|This is the only natural deodorant that works for me & I've tried tons! This is AMAZING in every way. It 100% neutralizes any odor (I've done lots of 'tests' myself including the husband test - him getting up in my armpits (gross!) but this is the only natural deodorant he approves!). It lasts all day, doesn't leave any residue on your clothes & won't discolor your clothes that awful yellow like some deods. Biggest selling point is it doesn't burn or irritate my skin (like one very popular brand that caused SO much burning, redness, irritation & left dark skin that took literally a year to go away!). Some people may think they don't want to try it because it's unscented but after trying all kinds of scents in other brands that left me smelling worse after they mixed with sweat (ugh), this one is awesome in that it just neutralizes odor & leaves me smelling like my clean self. If you want to wear other fragrances then you're not wearing competing smells & offending innocent bystanders. I've read so much info online about the issue of potassium alum - whether it's safe or not, etc. I've read that natural potassium alum (which is what this brand is) is better than synthetic potassium alum. Also potassium alum isn't the aluminum everyone's worried about in commercial deodorants (even though there's no clinical studies I could find showing 100% that aluminum causes health problems at this point). I want to avoid the other aluminums in commercial deodorants just to be safe. But after trying zillions of other natural deods without potassium alum, I'm ok with using this & don't feel I'm harming myself at this point. If research comes out at some point that definitively shows it's harmful, I'll rethink. But at this point I really want to live my life in confidence that I'm not stanking up my surroundings & disgusting myself & I'm ok with this ingredient. Figure there's way worse ingredients in commercial deodorants that I'm avoiding so I'm doing the best I can & this is whatworks for me. Oh and cost! It's so reasonably priced compared to some natural deodorants (I've paid WAY too much for natural deodorants & none truly worked). This 3 pack is definitely the best deal I've seen because I've paid $5+ for 1 container in certain stores. I personally like the roll on because I can take it in my purse / bag & apply it anywhere without wetting it (I guess you have to wet the stick version even though it lasts longer?). But I think I'm gonna get a stick version too just for home. Some people complain of it feeling a bit wet when first applied, so if you want it to dry immediately give a quick shot of air with a hair dryer or fan. But I find it dries fairly quickly even when I don't do this.    Seriously - love this deodorant, can't say enough great things about it & HIGHLY recommend!!!
B000ULLKLW|5|I received this lip balm about a week ago & must say I love it already. For the price you can't beat it.<br /><br />I always have dry chapped lips no matter how often I put on chapstick/balm/etc. This balm seems to stay on really well even when I drink water, etc. I don't find that its too thick for day use but you can always use it overnight if that's a concern.<br /><br />It has given my lips a nice rosy hue & is taking away a lot of the vertical lines. And it definitely makes them look more moisturized. I would love it if this made them plumper too but it looks like from the reviews it is better for moisturizing.<br /><br />Again though for soft, rosy, very moisturized lips for < $12 its well worth the purchase. I'll definitely be re-ordering.
B00DGRDQC8|1|Very disappointed.  This groomer doesn't work very well.  It gets plugged up with hair very quickly.  Poorly designed shaving mechanism.
B00PXI49JW|3|Low setting feels like high. Lightweight
B00EENBZFI|5|Smells exactly like orange trees blossoming, heavenly!
B000SWY02O|5|I've used many different self tanning products from lotions to sprays to foam, drug store to high end brands and Tan Towel is the best. The application is easy and fast, not like creams or lotions which I find to be time consuming. It doesn't have have that strong self tanner odor, there's very, very slight odor but it's not unpleasant. I followed the directions and it dried fast. I was able to tan my entire body with one towel. The color developed quickly and didn't look fake or orange. I'm very happy with my purchase and plan on re-ordering this product in the future. It came quickly, undamaged, and packaged nicely.
B001HV4H64|5|I luv these liners. They are smooth and highly pigmented. I will definiately be buying more. The come in a varity of colors!
B007FMXL52|4|We've used this for years and it does the trick.
B000MWVMXU|4|Works good but expensive for what you get.
B00IQX1K3Y|5|I bought this for highlighting after watching a video and im happy with results..blends well, eliminates shine and does not pronounce my wrinkles or lines..have not tried it as setting powder but looks it would be great as well
B00794NI7M|5|Very pretty! The stones do look different in person then they do online but the necklace is still very nice and looks beautiful on. Very happy with this purchase!
B0009VQ8OM|5|This is the best product for keeping feet soft and smooth even when wearing sandals a lot. I highly recommend to Creme because it is more effective than the lothion.
B009YYUGQQ|5|This brush is great for contouring I love it
B00NRM4D7O|4|Been using it for a week.  Feels nice and goes on smooth.  Havent noticed a difference yet in my crows feet but it hasnt been that long.  Like it though !
B0010JXVV0|5|Wonderful for guests!
B005CRLREY|5|I was so delighted this number was still available.  I had been searching for some time, and was tickled pink to find it. The color is perfect and it has been the only foundation that is truly silky and give a glow to my face that is flawless.  Love all the make-up by Alexandra De Markoff. I will definitely place another order.  Thank you.
B0051F37L8|5|It shipped on time, whith no damage. I like the scent, the style. I recommend this. I would bue another one
B006OMHR1S|5|These nail plates are great for the price. They are by no means perfect but I refuse to complain for the fact that I did not pay about $6 per plate like the Konad plates. I do own a Konad plate and am using that as my baseline comparison. Some of the designs are a little thinner than I'd like but they work. Some designs work better than others but overall I am quite happy with this purchase and have already recommended it to others.<br /><br />Tips: Use stamping nail polish. Regular nail polish can get sticky and not transfer well. If I mess up I thoroughly wet a Q-tip with acetone and softly dab off the stamping nail polish. Works fairly well most of the time (I'm not experienced enough yet).
B00EJDGY3G|2|No coverage, sticky feeling, off after a few hours. Will never buy again. This rating system is a pain. Should not have to count words
B00DN9V644|5|Wonderful product.
B000V2F160|4|I had to bleach my dark hair 3 times before applying the dye, I spent about 9 hours in the salon. After applying it, my hair was slightly violet in some parts, and the color was darker than the picture on the box, but it looked better after 2 washes. I have washed it 6 times now and it still looks like the picture.   What I didn't like was that 2 boxes of this product were necessary for dying my short hair. The content of one box was not enough.
B000BOA6Y0|5|the smell of this is so beautiful and fresh and it lasts all day! the only parfume i've found that i want to wear and everyday.  many of the parfumes from this company are wonderful, i just wish they were easier to find
B00JAOUJ76|5|Vi-Tae's certified organic Get Lathered Up! soaps are an affordable indulgence. I have tried two varieties and both are excellent - Shea Butter and Coconut Oil. The name refers to the inclusion of coconut oil or Shea butter as an ingredient, not the scent. There is no added fragrance or coloring so expect nothing but a natural looking and smelling product.<br /><br />The two soaps are very similar in appearance although the Shea butter bar has flecks of oatmeal suspended within it. So, in addition to visual interest, the oatmeal is recognized as a skin soother. I appreciate the lack of perfume because the soap is then gender neutral and useful to all in the household. Another benefit is that it eliminates the need to coordinate various soap, shampoo and lotion fragrances. It is one less aroma to integrate into my life.<br /><br />Organic is a term that may not be thought of as important when it comes to soap but perhaps it should be. The fact is that our skin is our body's largest organ and it absorbs the toxins and chemicals we apply, so it seems smart, particularly with products used daily, to choose items as unaltered as possible.<br /><br />Soap is, to varying degrees, drying to skin, but natural soap is less so because skin absorbs the natural fats contained in the bar. After using any soap, I need to use lotion, but seem to use less when the soap is naturally made.<br /><br />I noticed that the list of ingredients on the label notes that the glycerin (created in the soap making process) is retained. Wondering what that meant I did some research and discovered that this is not usually the case with soap made by big companies. Glycerin is naturally created as part of the soap making process. Some companies remove this by-product and sell it, substituting with cheap petrochemicals which, unlike more readily absorbed natural oils, just sit on the skin.<br /><br />This reminds me of what might appear to be a completely unrelated story about peanut butter. During a high-end blender demonstration the sales person, while explaining only peanuts and salt are necessary to make peanut butter told those of us watching his sales pitch to check the labels of the brands we normally buy. He said the addition of various fats to most commercially available peanut butter is done because big companies remove the valuable peanut oil created while making the butter. It is more profitable to sell the peanut oil and replace it with cheaper, less healthy substitutes - just like glycerin in soap.<br /><br />Back to the soap -- to prolong the life of the bars, do not leave them sitting in water. Instead place them in soap dish with a raised grid or something that permits drainage and dying between use. Attractively packaged in an unbleached brown cardboard box, the soap is visually appealing along with a smart choice for the user and is also a thoughtful addition to a bath themed gift.<br /><br />Soap provided by Vi-Taehigh-end blender demonstration the sales person, while explaining only peanuts and salt are necessary to make peanut butter told those of us watching his sales pitch to check the labels of the brands we normally buy.

B00JBQCG0Q|5|I use all waterproof eye makeup and these have no problems removing everything. I let the towelettes soak my makeup for about 5 seconds and most of the make up will come off with one wipe. Then I repeat for a quick gentle wipe to make sure everything comes off. Great for traveling!
B001E0VBDK|5|I love those soaps!!!! I have very dry skin, and those leave my soft and nourished. Plus they smell delicious. I will buy them again and again and again.
B00YOSJ4B0|5|They were perfect! Exactly what I expected, what I was told they would be!
B00BQMIGTI|2|very cute bag, but makes me wonder if it is authentic. The label looks like their is a print error. Quite disappointed with the purchase
B0084Q0KWA|4|The product itself is similar but not exactly as shown, but it works. They really should show the front of this case, it's like a fake gucci looking case.<br /><br />But all in all simple product and it works.
B00D1OCNWK|4|I was pleased with this purchase.
B00464IVMA|5|Very fast service and reasonable price for the product!
B000O3BDHW|5|I love this color and the formula is typical OPI. Great product for a good price. I would recommend getting.
B006DUX5WG|4|good one
B0007ZJDRE|5|I have looked High and low for a product like this,<br />The Trind Cuticle balsam is the only Balsam that works on my Husbands nasty toe nails, cuticles .<br />A Manicurist told him about it..<br />I Never would think any thing would give him good looking feet for the summer.<br /><br />I use it on my toe nails about 4 times a week. It does not take off my toe nail polish.<br />It does take away any dryness..You do not have to use a cuticle remove, it just makes your<br />your nails and skin around the nail, look good and not dried out.<br />Keeps them soft.<br />It is not gooey, just goes into the skin..<br /><br />It is a hard product to find. glad Amazon is selling it..It is worth every penny , or I should say dollars..<br /><br />Two thumbs up Amazon...

B000O3MHUO|5|Excellent product at a great price
B002DVHTFI|5|Husband pleasing and makes my hair really shiny and soft.  I like the scent, too.  And the price is outrageously good here.  I paid $8 more for it at a local drug store.  Love it!
B000XB8Y4A|5|I love this product.  It is the only stay on product that I have ever used that does not leave my hair feeling heavy and limp.  It also does not bother my eyes or skin, as strange as that may sound.  Many hair products irratate my eyes due to the heavy scent.  This one leaves my hair feeling soft and fluffy.  I highly reccommend.
B008I0I11Y|2|I didn't think about the quality of the fibers this wig would be made of. The hair looks like doll hair and tangles very easily. The dark brown isn't really dark brown and there are no combs to provide secure attachment. It's a nice style and was cheap.
B0020MM62G|5|Light sensual fragrance.
B005Y6F4WO|5|Fast delivery, good quality.<br />Thank you!! :)
B008PJZXT6|4|I like it. I would definitely try the more coarse rollers when its time to purchase new rollers.

B000FED5DU|4|I use this to both trim my beard and cut my hair.  It works well for both, but seems to take forever to charge.  I'm a procrastinator and so I tend to put off trimming my beard and cutting my hair until the same time(or I used to.  At full charge, and being left plugged in the entire time I use it, it runs out of power about half way through cutting my hair if I have used it on my face before hand.  So you can't really use it while it's plugged up, it doesn't draw power as fast as it uses it.  I have to leave it plugged up over night about before it's usable.  But, other than the power issue it works great.
B000C1VT3Y|5|this cologne is by far the sexiest cologne for men. it's very understated which makes it even more sexy. ladies.... i highly recommend this for your men.
B00449OIF6|5|Gorgeous gourmand scent somewhat similar to Angel but somewhat softer, with that beautiful pistachio base. Perfect for the gourmand lover who is looking for something new and a little different. Would make a great gift for the upcoming holidays.
B00HDL5VA8|5|Makes my hair feel so soft.  Its great
B002HLS14C|5|Good and sheep
B0092MCO88|4|Product arrived on time and was properly packaged. The hose does get hot when on high so make sure you cover your back with something or you will get burned. Overall it is just what I needed.
B00832VUDI|5|I have been taking this for 2 years. I cant live without it. It is the best!! No stomach pains, feels natural. REALLY WORKS!!
B004W1P6GG|5|This brush is strong, but soft. The bristles don't come loose easily, and I know it will last me a long time. The price is extremely reasonable. Most quality foundation brushes cost much, much more. The coverage I get from this brush it perfect, and make up is easy to apply.
B00DGXXO7E|1|Don't waste your money - it does not help manage or help control course curly hair in the least!  The condition smells good at least.
B003JMYL0G|5|works great
B00H7NKNE6|4|Very nice quality oil. Argan Oil has so many great uses, I use Argan oil as a moisturizer and eye make up remover. It doesn't leave a greasy after feel and it makes my skin glow. It's also great for your hair, I have naturally curly hair and hair products generally leave my hair dry and damaged. I like to put Argan oil on the ends of my hair to help against breakage. It also leaves my curls feeling soft and bouncy. I've tried many different brands of Argan oil this this brand is just as good as the others. Argan oil has kind of a weird smell so if that's an issue you can do what I do and add a couple drops of lavender essential oils to the bottle and it will mask the smell. Overall this product is very good for the price. I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.
B009W8UIVW|5|Super easy to use and a nice to have in between clients and when I cannot wash my brushes right away.
B00KCFAZTE|1|It felt tacky on my skin and it's the first product I've used that broke me out around my eyes.
B00147QL7E|4|This product does give a nice lift to my fine, thin, straight hair.  It helps a lot!
B00A01X3EE|5|The color is exactly as it looks online and the polish is a perfect consistency. The color is gorgeous and we love it.
B00REAHDPE|4|These glasses are really stylish! I like them!
B00T3JYAQE|5|These tweezers are really well made, are sturdy and durable.  They are sharp and tweeze really well.  I like the convenient carrying case as well.  It keeps them protected and in place.
B004YLUI2G|1|. does not warm up all the wax.<br />. takes more than three hours to melt the wax<br />and that having the temperature all the way up.<br /><br />Buy one that cost a little more!
B00GYF65TK|5|The eye-cream did not cause any reaction, which is really important to me when picking any kind of cream, especially products I use on my face. I have sensitive skin that tends to react to over-perfumed products.<br />The eye-cream is aimed at dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes. My review is based on daily usage over a period of a month.<br />Whilst the effect on the wrinkles is minimal as yet, although certainly noticeable, the real eye-opener has been the dark circles and puffiness. I get very dark circles under my eyes and am very fair skinned, so concealer is a must. I have found that the cream refreshes the skin to such a extent that I am using less concealer, because the dark circles are improving or appear less.<br /><br />It has an easy to use dispenser, so you are really only using a drop each time, which means no wasted product and no mess like other tubes. It has no odour, which I personally prefer, so it doesn't sting the eye. Most noticeable is the the way the cream cools the skin and it turn that cooling action helps reduce puffiness. Most of the creams I have used do not have what I call 'a cucumber action or feeling' to them, so this certainly is one of the most positive elements of the cream.<br />It has a gel like texture but isn't sticky.<br />After I had been using it for a few weeks one of my adult daughters asked to try it out (she is 23), and she is so pleased with the results she has already said she will be buying her own bottle.<br />Overall I have been very pleased with this products and the results.<br />I received a free review sample of this product courtesy of OZ naturals.
B00OIHJXIG|2|ANY deodorant is better than NO deodorant right? I really wanted to love this product. I've been looking for good spray deodorant/antiperspirants for years. In college I lived in Europe and everyone used spray deodorant so I tried it. Loved it. AND IT WORKED. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any American equivalent. I have Degree Dry Antiperspirant in 3 different scents. They're all very....intense. I can see why some people say they choke or can't breathe when they spray them. However, somehow, the intense scent fades slightly but seems to stick around while a faint B.O. smell begins to shine through near the end of the day. So you'll smell like fresh citrus and B.O.... YUMM.... Maybe I'm doing it wrong? But it seems rather hard to spray your arm pits the wrong way. I'm not a stinky or overly active person and I live somewhere quite cold, so I'm almost never sweating. I wake up shower go to work, workout, come home shower. Repeat. (my life looks really boring when I see it written down...need to work on that) Anywho...every other &#34;normal&#34; deodorant I have every used has been perfectly fine. Even the really cheap kind you want to try just because it look like it smell good. So, I don't think I have super hero strength B.O... I'm still on the search for the perfect spray deodorant/antiperspirant that I miss from college.<br /><br />These have been retired to the gym bag deodorant, the car deodorant, and the 'just in case I run out of deodorant and I can't steal my husbands deodorant' deodorant. :(
B003RA9XYO|5|I feel this product works really good on edges, it does however have a strong scent and I suggest applying at night.
B00ATFJ8NQ|1|I followed the directions exactly & tried the product 4 times & the results were really not better than the average haircare products I usually use, especially for the high price that it was.
B00CB7T2AO|4|Very cute!
B001AJ6YS2|3|Razor arrived on time and was well packaged. It gives a nice close shave but I've noticed some irritation on my neck so will have to wait and see if it is just from using a new razor or what. It seems to hold a charge very well but I've noticed it doesn't glide across the skin as well as a lot of other razors I've owned. It also seems very under powered. Not sure I would buy again.
B006GQYSGO|5|My husband loves this shaver.  He constantly compliments it.  Does very well.
B000KOOD54|5|Great product - fantastic item for the care of your teeth!!!
B00GTABRV6|5|Great product! Superfast Shipper!!!!
B005PUZZR8|2|Really good battery life, but it pretty much ends there  - at least for trimming short beards.  The 'slide up & down' guide is bulky and the hair grooves are ineffective.  Doing stubble or close trimming requires blade changes.  My old $9 trimmer with snap-on guides was far easier to use and also was gave more consistent results.
B00HZHOL60|5|The product is good.  Thanks
B007LVWHES|5|Original item from Resmed
B00506RUSE|5|Exactly what I wanted
B00D4RB1AO|2|Did not like this bag, it is not as out in the picture, is a bad product, with highlights that are not seen in the publication, unfortunately I can not return it because I bought from Chile.
B00MF7321A|5|First let me say that I go against convention when it comes to the sun. I believe that we are meant to get *some* sun (everything in MODERATION) because that is the way the body is *meant* to get Vitamin D (otherwise we would have developed livers like a horse has that converts stuff in our greens to Vitamin D ... they don't get D from the sun at all). I also believe that most sunscreens are more harmful than the manufacturers let us know... it goes against *my* common sense to bake a bunch of chemicals into my skin ;)<br /><br />I am a BIG fan of Zinc/Titanium Oxide based sunscreens ... because there WILL be those times when you have to be out in the sun for extended periods and need to protect your skin from overexposure and burning. So I was delighted to get the chance to review this product, and let me say I LOVE it.<br /><br />Yes, it goes on white ... like any other product with the NATURAL minerals that make up the protective portion of the lotion. However, I found that it soaked in VERY quickly for a mineral-based sunscreen. I've bought many in the past that just plain are too thick and don't absorb well. So that is Plus #1.<br /><br />Plus#2 is the truly natural ingredients. I'm an avid (maybe rabid!) ingredient checker and I look up anything I don't know or that has a name that I can't pronounce. The lotion has one ingredient that comes in that category: Sodium Laurylglucosides Hydroxypropylsulfonate. But a quick check found that this is a naturally derived , sugar-based surfactant that is very gentle and readily biodegradable and is used in  products for babies and individuals with sensitive skin. One other person on here claimed that the Xanthum Gum was natural but causes &#34;digestive upset&#34; ... however, that is only if you EAT something with Xanthum gum in it... and I personally have no intention of sipping on this bottle any time soon...LOL . Add to that that they have Aloe and Green Tea and a dash of Cocoa Butter in there and you have a really great product that will take great care of your skin!<br /><br />Plus #3 is how it feels on the skin afterwards. I really dislike anything that leaves a greasy or oily feel, and this product totally doesn't do that. It not only soaked in immediately, I didn't feel the need to wash my hands before touching anything that might be affected by anything oily (ie, phones screens/computers/etc), which is a testament to how well it soaks in.<br /><br />Plus #4 is that it's scent-free... or at least *I* don't smell anything when I put it on and I did a pretty good sniff test. I know that some people are really sensitive to perfumes and such and I couldn't detect anything that might trigger a reaction in those with this issue.<br /><br />All in all I can say this is something I have reviewed that I honestly would love to purchase in the future.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review. All opinions and experiences are mine alone.reat product that will take great care of your skin!<br /><br />Plus #3 is how it feels on the skin afterwards.

B004GWQDI6|5|this product smells so good I could eat it! I bought 2 and I will definitely order again!!! I really love it!
B003D7VGVO|1|I was thoroughly disappointed when I ordered this straightener because what came was a blue straightener without any temperature control. This is a misleading posting by Eye Candy because what you see is not what you get. I feel this is not a very honorable way to sell products
B0095SMB6O|2|To thin and doesn't look good on me.
B008FOT6U8|1|I feel that these are way to big to be used on nails. They stick out way to far and take up too much room!
B00DJBQS2G|5|AAA+++
B00SYD8Z9S|5|I absolutely love it! It was beyond my expectations! Great buy! Now i can organize my makeup better and take them anywhere with me!
B000X2W6LQ|5|The material used in making the mirror and extension arm is very sturdy, much better class than alot of mirrors I have looked at,at a much higher price. Very pleased with this purchase.
B00NVVGL7G|5|very beautiful color the sparkle the shine awesome
B000Z5YDO4|5|Jonathan is the biggest tool of a hairdresser/reality TV celebrity,  but this product is awesome. And it smells great. Very good pricing too!
B000P22TIY|5|Smells great.
B0062U5372|5|I was very surprised at how natural and nice this feels.  I haven't worn it much so I don't know how well it will hold up but it feels nice, is a nice color, and looks very good!
B001AAF69E|5|i got the brown one. it is quite small but nice color and it works pretty well!absolutely nice for this price.:)
B00UI9HJZ2|5|I have very sensitive and acne-prone skin, and I made the mistake of purchasing the Proactive system in 2012. While I mostly stick to Neutrogena products now, I did really like the sulfur mask that came with the Proactive system and was searching for an affordable alternative. Not only is the La Beaut&eacute; Pure mask affordable, it is a natural, SUPERIOR product. After one use, my skin was firm, smooth, and the very deep blackheads on my forehead were being pulled to the surface. After the second use, my obvious blemishes were gone, and the deepest blackheads on my forehead have nearly vanished. I'm 32, and I'm starting to develop those fine lines I'd like to treat, but I shy away from many moisturizers other than Cetaphil, which I use in only spot-trearments because of my sensitive skin. Now that I can visibly see my pores are getting smaller, I'm looking forward to keeping this product on-hand as part of my acne treatment regimen - and as a natural alternative for maintaining glowing, youthful skin.
B000L6U0K8|5|A+
B00AL0HVQ0|5|Great for the Bass Brushing Method. SOO, glad that this formula is all organic. It's a good deal to get these in a three pack - they last for a long time. A little expensive, esp., when compared to conventional toothpaste, but they're a great value for the quality you get.
B0012RUKAA|5|My aunt wanted this perfume so I ordered one for her as well as one for myself, again Amazon came thru with a pleasant purchase. and smells great.
B00J0AHJM8|5|Great product and great customer service.
B007SZCG0C|5|This product really did the job for me, my hair feels great since I have been using it an it looks great too! I was a little skeptical at first to try it but since it was recommended to me from a great source I decided to give it a try. I have noticed significant results with my hair. I have less shedding. It was totally worth my time to purchase this product, and the best part is that my hair looks and feels amazing. The bottle is also a great value because of the size I know that It will last me a long time. I look forward to continue using this product because I know my hair will continue to improve.
B007OYZ1V8|5|The scrub is amazinggggg! Im in love with my skin now! Feels just like a babies! This is worth it, will become an essential part of your day!
B00L1KFQKC|5|I started using this conditioner about 6 months ago - Desperate to find something to help my dry, damaged, brittle, breaking, frizzy hair.  Last week, my hairdresser asks me, &#34;What have you been doing differently these past 6 months? Your hair is shiny and healthy. The texture has completely changed.&#34; She assumed I'd changed my diet and/or added vitamins to my routine. I explained to her that the only change I'd made was a switch to Silk 18 conditioner (and Sage shampoo). This is an amazing product!! I'm 40 years old & have spent a great deal of that time & a lot of money to find a product to help with this hair-curse Mother Nature gave me. I've finally found that help! Thank you Maple Holistics!
B002WTCK1E|5|It is hard to find flossers that do not shred or break.....This one WORKS.  And the angle is a good one. I am a dental hygienist and know how important  flossing is. This mets the specs.
B006OZF7C6|5|Good Choice
B007ZN5CA8|5|Wow!  What a great curling iron.  Heats fast, tight grip, light weight.  I bought this primarily for travel but like it so well I will probably use it daily.
B00062OGLG|3|The fragrance was lovely, and was received in a timely manner. However, after only a couple of uses, the tiny stopper on top of the bottle broke off into the bottle. I notified the company of this, and they defended the product by stating that I may have been too forceful in trying to open the bottle. The stopper is so tiny, that it's difficult to get a good grip on the thing in order to open it. I don't believe I was too forceful; I believe the stopper should have a more manageable top portion, for ease of opening. The company did refund me $3.00, which I applied towards a new bottle of fragrance.
B00176GSEI|5|This shipped FAST!!! I got an email on the 4th (Saturday) saying my order has shipped and it was on my door step the 6th (Monday) afternoon. I love it. It does heat fast so I have it on the low setting. I have thin straight hair.
B00GKH9AQM|5|By far this mask is the easiest and most comfortable mask to use.
B000IHEFDI|2|this is very high price item compareto the quality and compare to how useful is this , I filled with the hina and it was very hard to come out when I was applying on hand . the bottles are too short very hard to hold the small bottle which stays only on fingers , if the bottles would be big , it might work better .
B006GL7TII|5|Shipping was right, the lashes makes my eyes bigger. I love it! :) The band it a bit thick, but that's a good thing! I can re use them.
B004KQDIJ0|1|These razors are very dull; they will cut your face.  Not recommended.  I had to use two razors just to get a decent shave.
B00OBNMGOK|3|Does not seem to have much effect. But, it is comfortable to wear and maybe needs several days to fully work.
B00171ETM6|4|I have a medical background and an Scottish/Irish background. For the price you can lather this on your skin without worries of allergies. Scentless is a plus all around. It is not a sun block, but as you get older your skin appreciates an emollient! (hint) put in on after your shower or bath as your skin is up to 100x more absorbent at that time....Specifically this helps the dryness of the lower legs mostly common even at 40..
B002PCSCQ0|1|This is brand new for $45 on sephora.com with free shipping. I hate how amazon let's people sell NEW products for double?!?!?
B00182F2BG|1|When I received this order only the brush was in there. No mirror or comb. Not the least bit happy.
B003XZQAQ2|5|great product!!!!! not a waste of money
B009DU4QYE|4|The Degrease shampoo for the most part, does what it advertises. If you have oily hair or combination oily/dry hair, it will help with the itchiness and refresh your scalp. Since I wash my hair every other day, right after washing my hair is smooth, silky and free of oil and grease; by the next day however, I can start to see that my hair near the scalp is more weighed down and definitely needs washing by the night. I took one star off since it didn't completely cure or rid my hair of oil grease and tiny flakes, but honestly this is probably one of the better alternatives I've found in the tens of products I've tried. Also be sure to condition your hair after using Degrease, which will help de-tangle and smooth your locks.<br />Overall though, Degrease is a great shampoo and I will be re-purchasing. Next up I am trying the tea tree shampoo from Maple Holistics, so we'll see if they one works better for my hair. I believe different people will experience different results, and this one is worth a shot!
B000F4GIPC|5|Husband has dry scalp and this is great for him.  We order in bulk over and over again.
B003PGKXSA|5|It's so nice...I am glad nd surprised how quick the shipping was. I am so excited to flaunt Lilly tomorrow for my Birthday. I reccommend Lilly to the customers. The seller ships fast so she's really da bomb.com. Thank you so much!
B000C1Z66U|5|got this for my husband..I've been telling him how much I Love this scent, but alas I finally just bought it for him myself and Boy! I'm sure he's glad I did. Love this stuff, the real deal. It must just work w/ every man's body chemistry. I can sniff this stuff out in  a crowd. I pray they never stop making Drakkar.
B007KL7DLQ|3|Works exactly as shown
B007SYYPS4|5|Nars has always been known for it's great colors and cosmetics. And this set did just that. It met every expectation I had! I split the set with my mother. I think I'm creating a monster with her! I may get suckered into buying her more expensive cosmetics instead of the \\"cheap\\" drug/grocery store \\"s***\\" she buys. She never finds products that lasts or that are really great because she doesn't spend the money on better products. So I'm gonna spoil her!
B001VD6JX2|5|EXCELLENT!!
B006GQYSC8|3|I am writing on behalf of my husband,who I bought the shaver for. This shaver's run time seems to be SLOWER than a previous Norelco.shaver. The charge time is faster though. And he doesn't like the fact that he CANNOT shave while the shaver is recharging !
B0045JAPYI|4|I didn't want to pay salon prices to have my gel polish soaked off, so I ordered this instead. The product worked better than expected. I used the cotton & foil method to soak my nails for about 10 minutes and the gel polish just slid right off. No dried out finger tips from soaking in a bowl at the salon & it smelled good too. Not a large bottle, but I don't get gel nails all the time, so I think it will last me awhile. My only complaint was that the bottle leaked a tiny bit during shipping, so the ink from the packing slip smeared onto the bottle.
B003DQOQJY|5|Juat as advertised, it works well with no stinging.  It kept me from getting burned in sunlight for four hours with no reapplication.<br /><br />The only downside is that it's a small tube for the price.  If only used on the face, this wouldn't be much of a problem.  However, I'll have to carry this and another sunscreen in order to keep the cost down.
B003P12W2K|5|I found this stuff at an Elephant Pharmacy and they stopped carrying it.  I had one container of it for 4 years.  I dropped it and it broke, so I had to replace it.  If I hadn't dropped it I'm sure I would have had it for another year.<br /><br />You do have to buy the magnetic case to go with it, but totally worth the investment.  I just cleaned it off and replaced the powder..good as new!!!
B000PSBCDG|5|I love this scent. I love the way I smell when I wear it and I get a lot of compliments on it. My new favorite!
B00HST6XPC|5|I cannot say enough good about this Anti  Face Serum.  For all the compliments I keep getting from family and friends it amazes me.  Just using it in the a.m  and then again in the p.m is a real reward to me. I look forward on going out and looking so good.  My face is just glowing from the results of this product.  Buying it makes me feel good to spend the money on an excellent product.  Never hesitate to order it from Amazon.  Dotsy
B002UFJ66M|5|Make sure to wash your face with Likas and leave it on for 3 to five minutes before you wash it off, it works sooo good. I would also recommend you have a moisturizer to use after using it because it can dry out your skin.
B006LMJYP8|2|Flimsy.
B00112AI9E|2|The one I received smelled pretty bad. I can't wear it --- but it was risk. Since this shade has been discontinued for quite some time --- so it's only expected that the lipstick may be old.
B003ZZHLTA|5|MY husband love's the way this stuff smells that will He go through it so fast that I can't keep him in stocked in it. He says that it will last all day long.
B00GOJMIWO|5|Great brush love them!!
B000NJQ8NQ|5|Very rich cream well worth it work incredible on you hands
B004X8K93S|5|That cream is Very Good!!!! My body stay very hidrated. I used during the pregnant and after. I really recommend.
B004KPYWM8|5|I LOVE THIS CREAM! Works well with all types of skin, soaks right in. Great for morning and night, and doesn't clog my pores. I put serum on under it, and this over, followed by sunscreen and I'm set.
B00411B4CC|5|This product works great on cystic acne.  This, in addition to salicylic alcohol, has cleared up my son's face.  Several other acne products did not work.
B003BRQ36O|5|Great price for the amount of blades you get!
B00F5CY0AY|5|Arrived quickly, best value.
B004RKPV2Q|5|This is the eyeliner that I've using for about 4 years now. I love how the brush is very sleek and soft compared to american brands where the brush is kinda painful when you're putting it on. The brush allows me to make very accurate lines and i just love it. It's not waterproof but, I like how it's easy to take off. I will probably keep using this eyeliner until they discontinue the product, haha.
B00HPHFGPK|5|This is my favorite tool to help me get my eye drops in. Never complains, never fails! David is a genius! He has magic hands, with nanometer precision and he's not bad looking, either! Live long and prosper!
B00OP21VU2|4|I love to color my hair at home, I know that sounds strange but I find it relaxing. I thought the 2 step process was easy, and was not complicated like I thought it would be. My hair was soft and strong after coloring, and it seems to last as long as other color kits. I did receive this product free to try from Vidal Sassoon but my opinions are my own. I hope you try this and like it as much as I do.
B00JEMRH38|4|It irritates my eyes after several hours but I have Roseaca so everything does. If you have normal eyes, I am sure it won;t be a problem. I still us it, I just have to be very careful not to get any in my eyes.
B00HCLLME8|5|Loved it
B002IRKK2G|5|I bought this for my daughter and she is really pleased with this product. I may buy her more of the same when this one runs out. The shipping was fast.
B001AMMSNE|5|This is a great hair product for people with naturally curly hair.  It defrizzes while creating great curls.  The only downfall is that it is not the easiest hair product to find, but it is worth the search.
B00LAOMUUS|4|Nice clean feeling on my face, not too thick or thin. When absorbed there is no residue. It is helping to fill my wrinkles and make them less noticeable around my eyes and forehead.<br />The pump can get stuck sometimes, leading you to press down hard and then too much comes out. But all in all a very good product.
B0085RZLQ8|5|Good replacement parts
B00AP70CLU|5|The compliments are endless when I flatiron my hair!  Does a FANTASTIC job!
B004I7IDI2|5|EXCELLENT!!  I USE IT OVER MY HEART, OVER ANY AREA OF YOUR BODY THAT IS IN PAIN, GOOD PAIN RELIEVER.  LOVE IT!
B002TQ4AO0|4|this works for a quick shave in the truck on the way to work but it doesn't get the hair on the neck very well. The head is not very ergonomic..
B002WJHL1I|5|I love the Thymes products.  The hand lotions are thick enough to moisturize your hands well but not so thick that they are greasy.  They also smell delicious!  Worth the extra money you pay because it's a good quality and great smelling (but not overwhelmingly so) lotion.
B00CC7TBHM|3|I bought 2 of them, and I love them! The only issue I have is that one was broken when it arrived in the mail, which was too bad. Other than that, great product, great price, just, better packaging would be appreciated.
B00787F1A2|5|As a birth doula, this is a great item to have with me at my client's births. The warm moist heat is extremely soothing for mothers in labor. I also have used it for my own menstrual cycles when cramps get to be too uncomfortable. I also love the eucalyptus scent. My clients approve of it too. It's like a warm blanket when you need the comfort most. I even bought a second one, I was so happy with it. Heats up quick, and the scent has lasted numerous times and still going.
B001E724A2|5|tastes great and leaves a refreshing taste in the mouth.  also the baking soda part whitens the teeth and leaves them shiny
B002DZ7K58|4|this product have different items for all your needs and its makes her feet feels so much better and looks good to try it i know your wifes or girlfriends will thank u for it.
B000PKYCM2|1|do not use if you travel I ordered this item<br />Dermalogica Environmental Control Deodorant... 4 times , when traveling the will break very easy
B00322UJGI|5|LOVE!  It's thick and soaks right in to dry skin and makes it smooth.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.
B00DGDICRQ|5|nice!
B00FZESMKG|5|Great product!
B001DKR2F2|5|I have tried many shaving products and  this one is the best for shaving and for a smooth face when finished.
B0094G3NH8|5|I found this foundation to feel light and provide enough coverage.  I also like that it is sort of spill proof. It gives you the option of how much you want to pump.  This is perfect if you carry your makeup in your purse.
B00FSFG0RY|5|one of my favorite soaps ever. smells heavenly. uplifting stimulating smell. a bit pricey so I don't use it every day. it's always a treat to use. highly recommended. great gift item.
B00IAKKSZY|4|It is really good! But the only problem is that the top is navy-blueish and not black, otherwise it is good!
B007GM1CBQ|5|Even though the writing on that back is not in English, I was not nervous about buying this product at all. Once it arrived, I wanted to try it out right away, but I waited until morning. The color matched my skin very well, and it smells good too. I like this better than any other BB cream product. Plus it is a good deal!
B00BSVPJ1K|1|Too small.. Clients do not like. Will not buy again
B005FK3M46|5|These work great! Nice sized images
B00014GTWS|4|I bought this to cover a tattoo. The quality of the product is really good and lasts a long time. However i didnt match the color to my skin correctly so ive only used it a few times. If i would have matched it correctly it would have been great.
B00RPL1W4U|4|This is a great little hair dryer that is very strong. I was surprised at how compact it was but it definitely packs a big punch. It's 1875 watts in a compact, great for travel size. I love the pink accent color in this hair dryer. It's cute and fun. This blow dryer is semi lightweight, easy to use, fits comfortably in my hand, and doesn't hurt my arm to hold up in the air for a few minutes. The diffuser is great and really helps prevent frizzy flyaway hairs all over the place. This blow dryer creates soft, shiny, easy to manage hair. The two different diffusers this hair dryer comes with is a very nice bonus. You truly get everything you need from a big dryer in one nice, compact, and elegant sized one with this. I haven't noticed any smell from the dryer like other reviewers have stated. Mine arrived clean and brand new looking. With any heat tool you will want to use a heat protecting spray so it doesn't damage your hair. *sample provided for testing and review*
B00I5H5Z78|5|I've tried at least ten products designed for shaving body hair.  This is the best product I've tried so far.  Use this with the Gillette men's body shaver and it's a winning combination.
B0037QGEN6|5|Noticeably fresh!! Strong cleaning without that alchohal burn!! I look forward to rinsing!!
B007MJK8M2|3|I use to buy this brand and color from the local beauty supply store and many of the stores I would purchase it stop carrying it.  I liked the lipstick because it was long wearing and would stay on all day.  For reason, that is no longer the case.  I am not sure if the product changed or what.  I still like the color though.
B000B8FRTU|5|Goodbye to adult acne, those annoying pimples that stubbornly won't go away fast enough. Worth the money - just explore online a bit and find the cheapest price. Great product!
B001FXUTUM|1|Crap. And what's worse, it was a painful piece of crap. I think they should sell this with something that can douse the pain cause I'm no wuss, but I was ready to throw this thing and hide under the covers.  I should've known that a metal spring wouldn't be pain free, and I guess I did kinda know that. I mean, I did expect some pain. But the first time I used it, I just started yelling passwords to my bank accounts because I thought someone was torturing me for information. O.O
B00JTM0280|5|fine
B002P8N7T6|1|After the first use, I stored this in a drawer. The next time I went to use it, the plastic cracked and the whole unit fell apart! At this price this is totally unacceptable.
B002N5MHLU|5|Best shaver I have ever owned. Used for 1.5 years now with no trouble.
B007E049VU|5|Makes a wonderful face mask and takes such a small amount to mix into creamy mud with addition of your favorite liquid ingredient (s.)<br />Takes a little time to arrive from Portugal but worth the wait.
B00AFCOZN6|5|good.
B00OVQZ6VM|3|The tint does work so i'm giving it 3 stars.  For me, the color only lasts about 2 days before I have to reapply it.  I have completely avoided wiping/washing my brows; however, the color still didn't last.
B007Q0WW0S|5|Ordered this a few weeks ago; about a year after buying my HSI flat iron. I had tried on the sample that came with it back then and I was very happy with how my hair turned out, but I wasn't sure if it was a mixture of the hair products I'd used. In the meantime, I was using a different brand of argan oil with agreeable results, but I had to treat my hair daily with the oil and iron to keep it manageable. Had I bought this sooner, I would not have wasted so much time on my hair; it's about 30 inches long and it was becoming a burden, so much so that I was considering getting a haircut. But as soon as I incorporated the HSI argan oil into my weekly hair routine, my hair is no longer something I worry about every day. I am very stingy with the amount of oil I use, and even just a little goes a long way and keeps my hair smooth (and smelling great) for 3-5 days in my personal experience.<br /><br />Customer service is excellent as well. When this bottle arrived home, half of its contents had spilled out into the box. I was very annoyed by this situation, but completely forgot about it when I shared this with BeautyChange and got set another bottle, free of charge.<br /><br />TL;DR: Highly satisfied with this product. Would definitely recommend to anyone struggling to keep their hair in control.
B000O7PKY0|5|The Fairy Tales products are amazing  including the shampoos.  They also have a better scent than most Lice products.  They are also quite effective.  I have observed results immediately on the little one and so I kept using their shampoo line which smells incredible.
B0058CJV50|4|Adds nice shine to hair and hair feels soft after I use this with my flat iron. It has a fresh scent. I tried it once without a flat iron and just blow drying, and could not see any results.
B0039LMTI8|5|i love it because it gives you the just right trimming without bumps...i use it every week ...keeps me preety nice and tidy.
B005S5ZSW2|5|I was worried about the smell of the product after reading the reviews but I did not find the smell to be bad at all!  It is a little nutty but not very strong at all, unless you are sticking your nose right in it.  I will say that the container it comes in makes the spray shoot out very hard in a straight line, not a mist.  I bought another container that has a better sprayer and put it in that to get the mist effect.
B001281404|5|My teen daughter actually wanted this product. It serves it's purpose.
B000C2370G|5|I have used it for years and this is the best price in town
B003MT2UF4|5|The above might be a slight exaggeration, but it cannot be denied that my world is a lovelier, less-itchy place and my outlook on life is much improved by being able to scratch. that. itch.  Indeed, a good back scratcher like this one might be the secret to world peace. Just something to consider.
B0009QZYII|3|Works well without making my hair crispy.  The sort of &#34;minty&#34; smell is a little bit too strong.  Think I will try something else next time.
B0037LKGT4|5|I sent a package of these to my husband, who's in hot and dusty Afghanistan. He finds them really refreshing and especially likes the fact that he can carry one or two in his pocket when he's on the go. I'll be sending him more for sure.
B000CNME22|1|I not only have  an original bottle, I still have the miniature bottle that came with it that is half full. What I purchased is a total FAKE. The writing on the new bottle is not the same as the old one(the real one) and they don't even compare in fragrance. This is not even close to the original, so don't waste your money. Amazon should be ashamed for selling counterfeit goods.
B001DKQ3O8|5|Very loverly, works great.
B001ET78BU|4|The product has a creamy texture that is not at all heavy on the hair. Good stuff! I use mine as a base for my leave in treatments.
B002YLEQ2Q|5|Love the thick wand!  Maybelline New York The Colossal Volume Express Washable Mascara does volumize my lashes and I can layer it a couple of times without clumping it.  I especially love applying this mascara to my bottom lashes because this is one of the few mascara that actually volumize the bottom lashes also.  With other mascara, I don't even bother to apply my bottom lashes because it doesn't even show.
B0096A1Z72|5|I love this stuff, it's a huge size and so tasty. I get an intensely fresh feeling from it. Unlike the standard/old yellow Listerine, this actually tastes good.
B002QAR8QG|3|I was looking for more of an unusual sent but it seems like a common sent you get off the shelves at any super market, or drug store.<br />This product I would not recommend because the scent is too common and not very sniff catchy.  Too Basic.
B00CNOUZE2|1|Fogged up instantly on first use.  Worthless don't make the same mistake.  Avoid this product.
B00275FRMW|3|I don't know how well it works, it will take a while to know.  I will keep using it and get back with you.
B00FUMU4OA|4|I have finished about half a tube but it doesn't seem to as effective as plain petroleum jelly Vaseline that you can buy for less than half the cost of this. I'll keep using it to see if the cracked skin areas improve further. One good thing though is that it is not as gooey as Vaseline and dries up quick so you can put on socks almost right away.
B002CKYZSY|5|I was pretty impressed with this. I use it to give my eyeliner that smoky &#34;smudged&#34; look, and it works splendidly. I was surprised that this cost around four bucks, because it does the job probably as well as more expensive brands. I don't know how well it would perform for extensively adventurous makeup attempts, but for basics like smudging or blending some liner (for example), this brush does an awesome job (and is great for those who like to apply their makeup with a touch of frugality).
B00O1Y1RDA|4|Dr. Severin's is amazing! It smells great doesn't cause any skin irritation. Ill defitely keep using this in the future.
B006MRPMVC|5|My head tends to get very itchy periodically. I've found this is the only brand of shampoo that reliably stops that problem.
B003DDNQ02|5|Excellent, wonderful, healthing, kills bateria, stops itching leaves the skin refreshed, tight.
B0054Y2370|5|Love it.  I have one and bought two of my daughters each one for their birthday since they were always using mine.  Works great!
B00IALDHDI|4|I received this mascara courtesy of Influenster in my Voxbox. I have to say that I'm very picky about mascara and I really like this one. It gives you length and volume without being clumpy. I would recommend it to any of my friends.
B005F1ISC6|5|I have used this product off & on for about 15 years. It does work great & helps my hair look fuller. In fact, the little areas on each side of my forehead where the air was receding now have hair. In the past I have gotten bored with it & found something that smelled better or was organic & switched to it. Results - hair started thinning again. I am back with the Nioxin products to stay.
B000KNHJ5G|3|I don't use this as much as I thought I would, I have no results when using the brush.
B001AJ6YS2|5|I have had Norelco razors before; but higher priced ones.  Not only does this model   7310 shave as well as the $100 one I just retired, it lasts longer on a charge. So if you need a new Norelco you won't go wrong with this one.
B00BB5YHEI|5|This razor replaced an electric razor I had for 10 years. I feel this razor does a better job, but that may not be a fair comparison due to my other razors performance surely having degraded over the years. I can however say this razor doesn't have the same build quality and I doubt I will get 10 years of use from this, but it was much cheaper in price. I'm very happy with this purchase overall.<br /><br />I was considering buying razors as much as 5x as much and I'm glad I didn't. This works really well for me and I'm sure I would have been less thrilled with something that I paid much more for that only gave me a slightly better shave.
B002Q68H24|5|Been using the bronze for years.  Makes my skin very luminious
B004GV8OSY|5|I purchased this item as a gift ... have used it myself during the year and it seems to be super effective for minor rashes and for some of those irritating skin conditions that just pop up for no apparent reason ...
B000WMYFQ6|5|Exactly what I wanted, I couldn't be happier!
B005AIH9A6|5|I tried different night cream and so glad I found this!  Pimples would popped up when my skin cannot tolerate oily cream or lotion, and if it is not moist enough, my face would be very dry and form more wrinkles.  This solve the problem!<br /><br />I tried a very expensive organic cream I bought from WholeFood, and my face was so dry that it felt like my skin almost crack!!  I'd stick with this.
B00HJ18ZEG|5|Nice smell
B0045K6H1M|5|Love this product! Had a Keratin Express treatment put on my hair, and have used this product only since then.  It has been 8 weeks and I'm still loving the softness, and no frizz!  The price was almost half of what my stylist was selling it for, and the shipping was below reasonable!<br />Very satisfied with product, cost, and short time before delivered!
B000BTRP30|4|My original Swedish Clover Foot File was actually made in Sweden.  These version are made in China - not the same quality.  They look just like the original one and seem well made.  I bought them as gifts so cannot at this time rate their long term quality.  My reason for the 4-stars rating is that the word &#34;Swedish&#34; is misleading.  It should say &#34;SWEDISH STYLE&#34;.
B002UUTCZ2|5|Has been replaced by Listerine floss, apparently the same thing.  Really does a good job on my teeth.
B002VL3B20|4|Good soap. No harsh Chems. Considerably reduced dryness after use.
B000B6VIPY|5|This product worked wonders for me!  My skin is clear and free of painful bumps.  In reading the few negative reviews I wonder if people didn't give the product enough time?  Nothing is going to work overnight. While I did see immediate improvement within the first few days, it was closer to 2 weeks that I'd be comfortable saying my skin was completely cured.  Try this product...you will not be sorry!
B00BQUAO5E|4|I got the earrings love them but wish they could be worn on either ear.  They only work on the right ear.  I'm still keeping them, I bought 2 pairs, thinking they would fit on both ears.  Now I have an extra one in case in breaks or gets lost.
B009A0VGKY|5|Nice!
B001GUMNMG|5|I could give this product a lot more than 5 stars.  It is EXCELLENT.  The name is very apt.  I put it on over eyemakeup and the effect is fabulous.  Stays put all day and is a true eyeliner not just glitter.  Every day someone compliments me on my eyes.  Also, it doesn't migrate to your cheeks and face so at the end of the day you don't shine all over like a disco ball!  Great stuff.
B00HXQDYWK|5|I have been highly pleased with this product.<br /><br />I first took interest in the technology after receiving ELT treatments from a local clinic, to which I responded well to. I use this violet ray device to compliment my formal ELT treatments, by holding the straight, oblong attachment in each hand for three minutes immediately before bed (as prescribed by Edgar Cayce for general wellbeing) -- and wow, it worked! The first effect I noted was a significant increase in bodily circulation; second, my sleep has improved as significantly, after years of chronic insomnia. I am, in fact, quite wowed at the success I've achieved from this product and its straightforward use. Consider me pleasantly bewildered (and quite well-rested, as it were).<br /><br />As for the Darsonval device itself, it appears well-made and durable, with a pleasing variety of attachments for different applications. Though, I've only been using it for a little over a month, so I can't testify to long-term usage. In any case, I've been highly satisfied with this purchase.<br /><br />My gratitude goes out to the manufacturer and seller, for bringing me a product that has granted such meaningful improvements in health.
B0087W5CX8|5|Item as described, quick shipment, refreshing smell and does not dry your skin.
B0051YNC7S|5|This is an absolutely AMAZING product -- absolutely brilliant-- but you can get it for $38 at Sephora. Don't buy at this price.
B00F008GFQ|5|PERFECT!
B00TSTZQEY|5|This is a high quality, pure and non-diluted lavender oil with which we are very pleased.
B00DQN8DSE|5|All around great. Everything is was advertised as. Will probably require some trimming to get to the right length but other than that perfect.
B000UV3G9Q|5|I love this thing! I am older, and hard to please, so I'm  delighted to tell you skeptic's this one is great. Plug it  in, put your bush in slide the door closed, and the cleanin' begins! Execellent price, works with electric brushes, and simple to use...what else could you ask for?  Be prepared to wait though, takes awhile to get it, but well worth the wait.
B00A9KBHR6|5|Since I do not wear nail polish, these buffers give my nails a very shiny, well groomed look.  Love them!
B00UKGCHNC|5|They were right...best tanning lotion ever!
B0055Y9VKQ|5|Thanks!
B000WI0640|5|Do it right the first time, works with any hair texture and does a darn good job at it too. We love these and I'm glad we bucked up and purchased professional quality sheers…stop buying rinky dink cheap scissors, these are perfect!
B0033713TO|5|This was a birthday gift for my significant other . Great price. Tghe smell is great i would shop more
B00A3LVMMQ|5|Nice looking and has a good weight to it so the razor stand feels secure. The finish was perfectly shiny.
B00CLILRMY|4|Can not say much about the product until I have used it for a while to see what it does. I went based on the good reviews. We will see.
B007TCJZMG|4|Feel like it was a good price for the full Gelish kit.  Handy to receive all the items I needed to do gel nails in one kit.
B00014D10G|4|Ordered this as a natural alternative to the brands that all contain something or other that I don't want to smear on my body.  So far I'm not sure if I like it or not.  It does help, but I've had trouble with B.O. that is unpleasant.  Having to reapply is not something new for me, though, so that part is not a big deal.<br /><br />The smell of the deodorant itself is not offensive to me at all and I'm very sensitive to perfumes and aromas.  So, on that I'd give five stars.
B00070QF20|4|I am 24 years old and have moderate adult acne and very oily skin. This works well for the major problems but doesn't clean up the real small bumps or blackheads. It is far cheaper than Proactiv(which i used to use) and works almost as good or just as good. I have gone without using this product, just to see if I still need it, and a week after not using, my face breaks out horribly. I still get a few large zits (mostly just before my period). IN THIS PRODUCTS DEFENSE, I only use in the morning. I generally fall asleep with makeup on (all natural, mineral makeup) because I am too lazy to take it off (I am working on this). I have consistently been using this system for 18 months and in those 18 months I have noticed my skin has become oily. I am searching for a system specifically for oily skin.
B00FBN0W5E|3|Good samples,I needed and wanted to try .
B008IEFREO|1|i have not got it yet. it is a truble ..  .  . .. . . . . . .
B004L4EING|5|Great product and for the right price you can't go wrong!
B00GAC0Y2G|5|no commeng
B001QX7QHU|5|these bands were perfect
B000142TJU|5|Omg! I never write reviews but this DEFINITELY gets a review from me. I hate to shave my legs because I have very coarse hair and it takes forever. I have tried hair removal creams for women before like Nair and Veet and they don't really work. I have left them on for double the recommended time and still had to shave afterwards. I just tried Magic Extra Strength Shaving Powder and decided to leave it for just the 7 minutes it recommended... Just to see if it would work. OMG! My legs were perfectly smooth on the first try! I didn't use a damp cloth to remove it like it recommends. I used a bath poof since I was in the tub. I will never shave my legs again! This is AMAZING!
B00ILCCUN4|3|I gave these a three star because they take so much time for the dropper to drop a drop! That said, they are so small and cute! I share essential oils with my friends with them.
B00NPZ3KY0|1|Very flimsy and hard to work with
B00I2ZKXUW|5|WORKS EXCELLENT FOR MY ROSACEA
B00MOL4AIQ|5|Bought these for my wife for Mothers Day.  She loves them.  May need to buy more as now my daughter wants to use them.
B004JZAL1A|1|I really, really wanted to love this - eye creams that contain SPF are surprisingly hard to find, and this one is so much cheaper than the other alternatives by Clarins, Shiseido, or Lancome.<br />Unfortunately, this product failed on every count. First off, the product was expired, making the sun protection factor worthless (which was indeed the reason I had bought this specific product). I kept it, thinking I could just use it as a regular non-SPF eye cream, but that too was a failure - the product itself is terrible. It did not absorb into my skin at all, leaving a visible film around my eyes that eventually started to ball up and flake away. Because of this, it's impossible to apply makeup over it. Nor have I noticed any improvement in the puffiness around my eyes (I'm in my mid-twenties, so I don't have wrinkles or fine lines yet), although this may be because I only wear it when I know I'm not going to see ANYONE else all day, since I don't want to go out in public with a white, clumpy, flaky mess around my eyes. Would not recommend or buy again.
B00OGNF62E|5|If you are a bicyclist, this works great for saddle sores, blisters, boils.
B0092MCO88|5|I love it so much I brought 2 one for me and one for my neice that love it also
B008JWW5K4|5|PERFECT IN EVERY WAY
B009YJW7OU|1|I just got this wig and it is by far the worst one I've ever received. As soon as I pulled it out of the package and saw how thin the hair was, I knew it was not going to be good. The hair is ridiculously thin and you can see the netting under it. It looks nothing like the picture, (admittedly I was going to use it for Kaneki Ken, not Prussia, but still...) It's shedding really bad. Like there are little sections of white hair everywhere now. On the plus side it came early. But now its just delaying me even more because now I need another wig. Oh bonus! I got a creepily long black hair along with it. None of my wigs have long hair and neither do it. DO NOT BUY THIS WIG! I am attaching photos. You can see in the pictures how bad its shedding on my hoodie. And how thin the hair is.
B004D282LU|4|This product is great for someone with oily skin, but even then, back up with a moisturizer.<br /><br />This 2-pack seems like a great deal, but I brought from seller: Cosmetic Liquidations, and the expiration date on the bottles is 3/2013. It is a week before February... I won't be able to use one in 2 months, so the second I must give away. You get what you pay for I guess.<br /><br />PS I love the cucumber scent.
B004B0U57S|5|Didn't find any flaws, very nice!
B005TTY53U|1|I did not like it at all. Rite Aid has this oil, and I got the small one to try. The smell and even the texture of that was different.
B000GFCRGO|5|Extremely Love my new straightener!! I use it almost everyday. It does the job perfectly, I don't have to leave on my hair long, just glide it over and it does not have to be on the highest temperature setting.
B000A408OE|2|This product is very oily. It's the most oily tanning product I've ever used. The product's oily feel doesn't go away until you shower. I haven't noticed any remarkable change in the color of my skin. It's very smelly as well.
B000GLRREU|3|The item works well but do not buy it from Hammacher Schlemmer! Ever since buying this I started getting catalogs from Hammacher Schlemmer and then I started getting catalogs from other weird companies. Turns out Hammacher Schlemmer sold my name to &#34;Direct Marketing&#34; and they are the ones spamming me with all the crap in the mail! Never again! The product itself however works well. It holds a good amount of water and it comes with a nice assortment of attachments to connect. My only complaint is how LOUD this device is. I'm always afraid to use it late at night in fear of waking up my neighbors.
B0018A32XS|4|This shaver works much better than my last one for legs and underarms. It's not as close as a razor, but it's so quick and can be used dry. My only complaint is that there's no guard for a trim vs. a close shave for bikini area.
B0038RFM32|4|I have been using this product for about a week now and have been loving it! No residue build up what-so-ever. It helps with the frizz and keeps my curls locked in all day long. This one is a keeper!
B007XA49O8|5|I want people to know it is completely edible I use it for cooking all the time it's great.
B00RFM1Z2I|5|Just received both sets I ordered- within ONE DAY and that's regular shipping! Satisfied completely! The color is a bit off, (more of an ash tone) but it's nothing I can't work with.
B000B5NEMU|5|my nephew loves this stuff, he wears a mohawk and this is the only product we have found that actually makes his hair STAY PUT!!
B000QSPDO4|5|These are one of the smoothest smelling incenses I've ever had the pleasure of burning. These are of superior quality and smell absolutely wonderful. This incense has a rich velvety quality to it. They are all natural, hand rolled with no added chemicals. They are a bit on the short side, and each stick lasts approximately 35 min. Incense is  well packaged in individual boxes of 10 each. Do not hesitate to buy.
B004G7HYGG|5|thank you
B0065ZC4XA|3|It's what I suspected when I ordered it - low grade makeup so I got what I paid for and most likely will never use it but pass it on to the kiddies for them to play grownup.
B001MA0QY2|5|Fastest hair straightener I've ever owned and the bag makes it easy to travel with! You can choose a temperature at which to straighten your hair as well.
B00UKCR4RU|4|It actually works!  I use it every other day and my hair is sooo soft.  I also use argan oil every morning but that only seemed to be staving off the dryness.  This mask has actually made my hair unbelievably soft.  Like the way it was when I was a kid.  Recommend!
B000NPWQU4|5|I love this product! I am very fair so the color builds up a bit faster than it might if I had a medium skintone, but it never looks orange or fake. I use this to maintain my tan, either from the actual sun or from the regular self-tanner I use. It seems to remedy the dreaded patchiness I always experience when it starts to fade. It smells really good when you first apply it but does dry down to a the usual self-tanner smell after a couple of hours. Yes, it is shimmery. I personally like this and think it gives you a nice glow, but in direct, bright sunlight you will look shimmery from up close. I've used several gradual tanners over the years and this one is by far the best I've used.
B006L1DNWY|5|I love this item. They are so useful and neat. Seller is so good. Love this item and I will buy another set for my friend as a gift.
B000050FDX|5|Very pleased with price after shopping locally.  I never realized how bad the razor was until replaced blades and screen.
B00BPOL5D6|1|doesnt work
B003EH22KC|5|Keeps my curly hairs from frizzing up
B00DLRNSSK|4|Love this dermarestore my stretch mark is lighter then before. I been using this for the past 5wk or more, I'm happy that I order this just to try it out, work great for me.
B0007X74CW|3|Won't change you life or stop your hair from falling out.<br /><br />FWIW:  I'm a man with fairly short, baby-fine hair and I rarely use styling products like pomade or gel.<br /><br />I must add that this product is simply not in the same category as say, Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Shampoo.
B003CGV2I8|5|I have curly hair and it really works for taming the frizz. It isn't heavy and doesn't weigh down the hair.
B00B81XR1Y|5|Used it seems to work good.
B002OE9GOQ|5|This is my 2nd  Remington F3690 shaver. I bought this for traveling, while my 1st stays in the medicine cabinet at home.<br />Good. lightweight shaver, does a fine job (if you don't have a heavy bread).
B000052WYN|5|My favorite waterproof eyeliner!! Stays on until I take it off - goes on easy and can withstand my sweaty workouts!<br />Just as great as the expensive premium makeup brands!
B000EEBWFE|5|Good product, arrived on time.
B00TXWTGSI|2|I was very excited to hear that these plates were being released, however after receiving them and going through the process of Testing every single plate from both sets that I ordered I must say that I am very disappointed! Many images either do not Pick up at all, or some of the image is missing! I have been stamping for many years and have thousands and thousands of stamping plates (Including every other set bundle monster has released)I have tried many different stamping polishes, scrapers, along with different techniques however, I still have not had the success I was hoping for! I would not purchase these plates again!
B002LL57Z4|4|I had been thinking about getting a hair turban for a while now. I saw this product had many positive ratings and reviews so I decided to try it. I am very satisfied. I have long and thick hair so I wasn't sure how the turban would hold all of it in. It actually does hold all of my hair with no problem! It's super easy to hook it so it stays in place. It's also soft and absorbent so it will greatly reduce my blow drying time. I would definitely recommend it!
B008CEDY5O|3|I'm almost down with the jar (I've had it a month) and I don't see any difference before or after using it.  Maybe it's a long-term thing.
B0097G3XDY|5|It works! I've gone through several of these over the last couple years and they work great. My lashes are noticeably longer. I don't think it makes them a lot thicker but I'm well satisfied with the length. I can get a couple months out of each container. A little goes a long ways!
B00DFEGDVS|5|This product is great and the pump form is so convenient. It's a cost effective to the acne.org products and you get a lot for your money. I will purchase this again and again. I use it twice a day as part of my daily skin routine and it really works.
B00NJ9W3XQ|3|Very stiff which makes me feel tightened but then cannot put makeup over or it would break down effectiveness...  If you don't wear face makeup it will be excellent..
B00008Y1BE|5|I'm 51 years old, and I've been using Maybelline Great Lash Mascara since I was about 15.  I have tried other brands...including very expensive brands...but I always ended up going back to this product.  Those pricey products just weren't any better, and sometimes they were just awful!<br /><br />I am not alone...<br /><br />One day, out of curiosity, I just asked 3 of my female coworkers what kind of mascara they use.  2 of them reached into their bags and pulled out those familiar pink and green tubes and waved them in the air with glee.  The 3rd one said she used GL, also, but didn't have her tube with her.<br /><br />So, never mess with the best, Maybelline!
B001FRQ78Q|5|Wow!  How wonderful to be able to SEE my face.  I can't tell you how happy I am with my purchase of this one!!!!!
B001CS8BJ6|5|Shaves very well for a travel size and uses 2 AA batteries that can be found anywhere.  Best for the price.
B001CC1I3S|5|This is my favorite hand lotion.  It is light and the fragrance is divine, but not overpowering, and doesn't argue with whatever fragrance I might be wearing.  My only concern is that they may discontinue it.
B0090UJFYI|5|Love this stuff! I decided to see what all the hype is about, and let me tell you the stuff in this little bottle is amazing. I'm a bit of a beauty product junkie and always looking for a way to help combat those little lines and wrinkles. Lines are minimized and my skin feels like butter. I not only use it on my face but my hands as well. I've even tried it on my legs which are always super dry no matter what and now they are smooth as can be. Great value a def must try!
B003U8ESI4|1|This trimmer is not up to par. Was bought about a year ago and the batt no longer holds a charge. The vacume door is ready to break very disapointing  They should of kept making the old T- 980 it was much better made. Hope this comment helpful to others
B0060OLVS0|5|Excellent Moisturizing cream, I recommend
B004VXIRRA|5|I bought these for a friend of mine to help out with his tattoo business,he was really surprised & loved that I did this for him.
B006QB4BSE|5|I will buy again and again!
B00340T6XU|5|your skin feels new and clean very soft
B00875KPGY|5|This was a special item for me since I normally don't spend this kind of money on \\"body wash\\".  Absolutely love it.  Love the scent, lathers well with a small amount on a shower pouf (lasts longer).  Definitely worth the price to me and I have bought it several times now.
B007DYUGTQ|4|satisfied
B000MANVWW|5|Great price, nice scent!
B000TUZQK0|5|Really good stuff.  Look up on the Internet all the good stuff this guy does.  I am so grateful for companies like this who take the natural and DO NOT GOUGE the customer as if they made rocket science.  THIS IS GOOD GOD NATURAL STUFF and Dr. Christopher won with his combinations.
B000BRPMJQ|5|Fast absorbing, not greasy, not overly perfumed.
B008DK99MO|5|My sister actually was the one who was all for buying this item.  I must admit I was hesitant.  I thought oh dear money just thrown in the garbage.  My daughter had a frozen theme party and my sister though the tiara should go with the dress.<br /><br />it has now been about 2 months and the tiara is still in great condition.  It is sturdy flexible/expandable the rhinestones have kept well.  The combs on the side are good enough to hold the tiara in place and don't pull the hair.  I'm convinced this is a pretty good tiara, given that my daughter is rather tough on her things.  I didn't think it would last this long and it has survived!
B000JK4PHA|5|i like
B00IKTUA62|5|This sparkles like a bottle of liquid sunshine!  I was very surprised when I started putting it on my toe nails and saw how much it glittered, so I applied it to my hands, too.  It's beautiful.  Looks much better than the picture.
B00SEKMZCO|2|It was not at all the color I expected and looked horrible on my lips. My children told me to ditch it and not wear it again.
B000C1UDPO|5|The colognes were bigger than I expected and they smell amazing! My boyfriend wanted some good smelly stuff for Christmas, so I thought this was a good option because it gave variety.
B000JNQSIQ|5|I purchased these clippers last year and it's still running strong. The precision and comfort these clippers deliver are a must for anyone.
B000UX9VU2|3|Just get proactive its a hype. I cleanses face well but not for severe cystic acne. Now Using proactive And murad spot treatment.I does not have a  toner
B008PDZYZK|5|Brend, made in Japan, good reviews, made of high quality materials, quality shaving - all fully consistent with the declared ....
B003COAFPQ|5|I use this product mixed with the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil and as a back up the Hair Food. I haven't used half of the product but have already reordered. I plan on keeping this as my main hair care and growth regime. I have a standing bi-monthly visit to the hair salon and my stylist uses 'my mixture' as a conditioner on my hair. My hair is softer to the touch and I receive compliments about how healthy my hair looks.
B001440150|2|Hate the smell, it's just like rotten fruits !! Lathers ok for an organic shower gel, it performs ok just the smell that's the most bothersome
B00598SS70|4|Color comes out great! It's a very strong smell when you're applying it, but after it dries you can't smell anything. Super easy to make, and the kit comes with reallly well written instructions. Had no problems making the mixture.
B004HNDLB6|5|I got exactly what I paid for. I love this moisturizer, I have very sensitive skin and it doesn't burn AT ALL or bother me AT ALL. It quenches my skin :) and it smells nice. The serum does burn a little... not my favorite. And the cleanser is alright. But the moisturizer is AWESOME!!
B006GQG9GQ|3|THis is a great color and it is very natural looking, but I gave it 3 stars because it does not last on my lips and I have to reapply often so that is important to me, as I dont like to reapply make up at all throughout the day.  I gave this to my mother who loves it however and she is happy with it.  It feels wonderful on the lips and is extremely creamy feeling.
B003Y3D2N2|5|The replacement bulbs arrived promptly, and were easy to install. They were a little different from original in that they were only half blue and my original bulbs were totally blue. This was actually much better, since much more light is now coming through and the mirror is brighter. I recommend this product.
B004673HQC|5|I'll always buy Avon Platinum line because once discovered a few years ago, it works the best for me compared to some pricier lines.
B000WZT9TG|5|I Have always liked polo sport its just getting hard to find now, love the scent. Wish I could find bigger bottle. That is all.
B000NL0T1G|5|The perfect razor for the perfect gentlemen. If you think shaving is a lost art, then I implore you to try this fine piece of machinery. When I go on my many business trips around the world, I always pack this razor. It's completely worth taking it with my luggage. The horrible new age razors damage your skin, and always give you nicks, especially around the neck. This safety razor takes more time to shave, but damages your skin less. If you want a silky, beautiful, and impeccable face(like I have), switch to this razor. I am a man always traveling , and have dealings daily with high level clients. My personal appearance is essential to my success, so it's no wonder I put such care into shaving. From the head down on down, from my perfectly chiseled features, to my lustrous Omega watch, I am a man not to be taken trivially. Join the mile high club, and become an adonis of man. haha
B0073A39AI|3|High quality product but not full coverage. Though it does smell nice, I believe that face products should be fragrance free.
B00B50RX72|5|Dry skin is a thing of the past with this product. Love it!
B006IBM21K|5|I quit polishing my nails because I always woke up the next morning with 'sheety' nails. I received this dryer for Christmas. I followed some of the recommendations given. I dried each layer and when I completed my layers of polish I dried my nails for about 25 minutes longer. I was so excited the next morning when I awoke with NO sheety nails. I love this dryer and will finally be buying more and more colors of polish.
B000MN63CO|2|Very fragile, lasts around 2mo.
B004FCMXP4|5|The best of the best very good product
B001H5Z9GW|2|People say this has little to no scent but the moment I put it on my hand I smelled it. It has a funky smell that I found just as bad as light b.o. Granted I have a very sensitive nose.<br /><br />It also hurt! It burned all day and when it stopped I started to stink. So I thought, well maybe it was just sensitive right after shower. Applied more since I didn't want to smell. It hurt worse!<br /><br />Today I have red patches in my armpits from the irritation. So safe to say its not for me.<br /><br />I will stick to the Naturally Fresh Deoderant Roll Ons. They are the only natural deoderant that has worked for me. I only have to apply it once or twice in a day. And letting it dry might be obnoxious but better than burning pits.
B0054H0NZ6|5|This is a most wonderful kit. The smell was a little strong, but ventilation will help with the smell. The product was exceptional it was easy to apply and easy to use. I did not use the nails tips, I just applied the acrylic powder to my own nails to help them be a bit stronger and easier to polish, One application lasted two weeks. A great product. I will keep using this and telling my friends about it. The instructions helped but left out how to clean the brush after use. I soaked it in nail polish remover to clean it for the next use.
B003XNM8KG|3|VV Platinum does smell similar to CK1.  It's a little more feminine.  The bottle is absolutely gorgeous and a great value.
B00CO6S672|5|I was unsure about buying the big set so I got this sample set first and found it worked for my skin. Everyone has different needs for their skin, I have pretty red cheeks and was breaking out so I figured I'd give this a shot. In combination with an adult acne treatment and probiotics, my skin has started to clear up greatly.
B0015GPX28|4|classic good looks. Can be used casually and dress occasions.
B005A96JBK|5|This is a great blade. My only complaint is that on some blades, the glue extends on to the razor edge.
B006Z43V5G|5|Does what it's suppose to...love it!  It doesn't take long to heat and curls nicely.  I like the dial temp and protective heat cover it comes with.  Good buy!
B008S3C5BI|5|😀👍🏻good stuff !!
B000H7O5M0|5|These are the best beard trimmers I've ever owned. I praise these to the utmost for being able to trim my incredibly thick beard.
B002ZPQ9PS|5|I am an apricot afficianado and I have to say that the scent of this is true and utterly divine.  Very mild on my skin.
B00ID87C8E|5|I loveit
B000IMS16U|4|This is a wonderful bath salt for when you have a cold or just feel under the weather.  A cup or a cup and a half of this in a hot bath, lay back and soak for a half-hour or so, and you'll feel so much better when you get out of the bath.  We bought a small jar, which we used in a flash, so we bought the larger size.  We love it.
B00O29H7JM|5|If you have a beard, this is a must have! It makes your beard very soft and it tames it. I highly recommend it. I'm gonna get the shampoo next.
B004QT89DQ|5|I purchased this dryer in the hopes it would help keep my curls from frizzing and it works great.  The attachments are such a plus and the power dries my hair in half the time of ordinary hair dryers and NO frizz.  I love it and wouldn't hesitate to buy again.
B005OZF1S2|3|Not thrilled.
B001VBBI2G|1|I don't like perfumey smells of most hair products but I thought this smelled nice. Too bad it didn't do anything for my hair, no curls at all. I've used Bumble and Bumble Surf spray and Cusco-Murphy Beach Hair and they're much more effective in making my naturally wavy hair curly (but unfortunately, they're more damaging too).  I would not buy this again.
B0009RF9OG|3|Trying to thicken up my eyebrows, using for about a month, so far no significant difference.  Use on a cotton swab in order not to have it drip in your eyes.  I will update this if in another month I see a difference.
B00HNRHOI4|1|Inferior product - unpleasant odor, greasy, runny, non absorbing.<br />Requested refund and bought another product.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|works great.
B000NJG82W|5|This guy is great - really gets my scalp goin! Works as described and has a nice lil loop for your finger to go through.
B00IALDHDI|5|I was sent this mascara complimentary from Influenster! Must say it was very easy to apply, made my lashes larger and more volume and just easy to use! Bravo Cover Girl! This is a great product!!
B009UFP164|2|My lips gets really dry and chapped easily that's probably why this one didn't work for me.It does clings to the dry patches on my lips and i just cant tolerate the bitter taste of it.I have to throw mine out coz i dont see myself using it anymore.
B00AWRGZAK|4|Very good
B001H54RB0|5|Very good price for this product!
B000JVW9CC|5|I have a pretty clear complexion but who doesn't get a occasional blemish? This is the ONLY product I have ever used that has successfully cleared up those annoying blemishes almost completely overnight! Amazing!
B008CYBTT2|1|We love method detergent, but this is 2, $20 items. It shouldn't cost anywhere near $100. Save yourself some money and get it here: [[ASIN:B004O5Z9CQ Method Laundry Detergent with Smartclean Tech, 85 Loads,  Refill, Free and Clear, 34 Ounce]]
B000YIYWSY|2|Please bring back the old version. It was purple in a clear bottle with a turquoise top.  This one has a weird smell to it.  Floral old ladyish smell.  It also does not condition my hair as well as the old version.  Seems to leave my hair a little dry.
B005BYXMS2|5|This is will be the shortest review I'll ever write:  Awesome Soap if your a fan of the scent and the patchouli is so strong you can smell it through the Amazon box it's shipped in. Enuff said -- take my money.
B001TK4LM8|1|If I could leave a no star rating I would. There was no safty seal on this. Looks like someone used it and tried to depot it since the whole bottom is cracked off. Ita sad because it looks like the seller knew, thats why its covered it tape. I would not mind if the tip was untouched. There is lines and discoloration on the tip. It is unsanitary, there is no way I could use this product. If the seller can make this right I can post an up date. Nyx is an amazing brand the jumbo pencil is just what you need to make any eyeshadow pop. I will continue to buy nyx products. I can never buy from this seller again.
B001MJSAJQ|5|Excellent
B00BB5YHFW|4|These cool looking clippers will get the job done on touch up jobs or short hair, but they are not up to snuff on really thick, coarse hair.  My husband has super coarse hair, and I had to go over some spots more than once to get a good, clean cut.  They are still a good pair of clippers, but you could probably get an even better pair for a little more money.
B001FU1Y9U|5|Seems like an excellent soap product, works just fine, no lingering aroma of pine tar either. I would buy again.
B000P22U56|5|MUY BUENO
B00SHL9FPA|3|cheap but does the job
B006UETDGC|4|I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known it was a cream blush. But having bought it, I think it applies nicely, and if pigmented enough. I do enjoy it on occasion. I do not use it often because I do not care for cream blushes. Overall, nice product
B00HZRVSQG|4|took a while to get here but love the color
B0093W57FE|2|works well only when applied perfectly..main disadvantage is it stays only for few hours(4-5 hrs max)..it should be longer acting..
B00NLO0YGW|5|Looks funny but works.
B00DY9FBDA|3|Now, to make this clear, I have NEVER worn contacts before, So i find then very uncomfortable. My eyes are blue, so they make my eyes look dark purple, nowhere near pink(like the picture) But if you are used to wearing contacts, and you want purple eyes,you might like them.
B009NOUI9M|5|I really like the color  and looks pretty good ... good quality.... I am very happy with this product, i like !!
B007ZN5ATQ|3|I guess it is good for what you pay, if I strictly talk about the brush functions, it works really well and I like the fact that it turns off automatically after two minutes of brushing, telling you the optimal time for a good clean. However I'm just rating this 3 stars due to the fact that it collects saliva and water inside, it gets really gross really fast. I now clean it after each use which is a hassle, but I guess that's what you get for the price.
B003N9GC3Y|5|Love the hair thick and silky and tangle free for me!!! Will buy again.
B00JITDVCI|4|Seems a little underpowered, but it does the job for me.
B00JVYCH16|4|Great product,  enjoying it with my new diffuser.
B0015T9934|5|They work like they're advertised to.  I use them between a big toe and the next one in because the 2 toes usually rub together and cause a sizeable callus, which does NOT appear when using this product.
B00KPU21DE|5|This conditioner has all the right ingredients for hair and doesn't feel oily or weigh it down.
B00C5IJ01K|4|The quality is really good.  They haven't shrunk or anything like others I've purchased in the past. The color is exactly as described too.
B00ARBDE3W|4|expected this bag to be a bit bigger than what it is.....cute bag tho but i dont think it would hold most of my cosmetics...
B00B22BCJS|5|Good moisturizer for the skin as well as making it clean.  Scent is refreshing as well.
B00EA5AB1Y|1|I purchased this to replace my other bottle that ran out. I don't know if CND changed the formula/color, but this is not the same negligee that I owned before. The color is ultra sheer, even with three coats. Will absolutely not purchase again.
