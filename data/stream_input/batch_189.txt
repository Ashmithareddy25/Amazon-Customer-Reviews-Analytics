B000002C1V|3.0|The Final Cut is a much more subdued affair than The Wall, for all its lyrical rage. And there's lots of lyrical rage - The Wall was about the fall of an individual, but this album is about the fall of an entire nation. The first thing anyone will notice is that the music has been pushed to the background. It's certainly devoid of hooks, but not altogether unappealing. David Gilmour didn't have much creative control in the making of this album, but his ability to insert a li'l guitar solo in between Waters' verse helps a great deal. <br />Of course, Waters' own lyrics are great, and his most complex and mature yet (only one recognizable chorus in here, the one in &quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot;); his antiwar treatise isn't as convoluted as story of The Wall, where you practically had to watch the movie dozens of times to understand the plot. And the album IS after all, only 40 minutes long - if it were any longer, I'd figure it would have been a boring failure, but as it is, it's fine. And it's far, far better than either Roger or David's solo &quot;efforts.&quot;<br />Two negative things can be said about this album. One is that it represents (in hindsight) all of Waters' insane egomania. Richard Wright had been fired by the time of this album, and Nick Mason, though still in the band, was replaced by a session musician on the last track. And Gilmour didn't have much of a voice, and his solos aren't as inspired as on The Wall. In fact, this album sometimes seems as one of those deliberately inaccessible deals that arrogant artists occasionally do. The second is that, while it's less convoluted and shorter than The Wall, and maybe even its lyrical superior, it still lacks the emotional connection that The Wall's best moments made. There is nothing here as heart-wrenching as &quot;Hey You,&quot; nothing as anthemic as &quot;Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2,&quot; nothing as adrenalin-a-rific as &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; or &quot;Young Lust&quot; and nothing as despairing as &quot;Another Brick in the Wall pt. 3.&quot; And since it presents many of the same themes, one can't help but prefer the ambitious double-album over The Final Cut.<br />But nonetheless, it does have merit, and much of the flak it has received is undeserved. In fact, there's quite a bit of material - &quot;Your Possible Pasts,&quot; &quot;Not Now John,&quot; the title track and &quot;The Hero's Return&quot; - that makes it worthwhile, although it lacks the emotional resonance of Pink Floyd's best work.
0783232039|2.0|To start off, I've never been a fan of the Child's Play films anyways.  But besides the point, I saw this film a few days ago- what the heck is this?????<br />When did Child's Play become a comedy?  There is nothing scary at all in this film anymore.  Back when Chucky was out hunting for Andy- it was scary, now it is just a waste.  Sure, I laughed a lot, but is that what this film was meant for?<br />Another point- After Chucky and Tiffany did &quot;their thing&quot; (how is that possible for plastic dolls???), how could the Tiffany doll produce a baby in less that a day???  STRANGE.<br />The acting wreaked- (the human people), and even the visual effects sucked.  From Chucky crawling on the sidewalk, to Jennifer Tilly getting electricuted in the bathtub- it was all bad.<br />The only stars for this film go to how stupidly funny it was, and Chucky's voice.<br />&quot;Hi, I'm Chucky... I wouldn't see this if I were you.&quot;
B00005OWIU|5.0|Could only be brilliant: John Williams, doing the score for such a magical and epic movie? C'mon! It's like 2+2. Very obvious how good this one will be.
078324228X|3.0|In a non-fiction film (mostly), about the late boxer, Rubin Carter, who's imprisoned for a crime he didn't committ, nearly fifteen years later, a child reads his book and gets his family in a decision that is so moving, and so risky- trying to prove Rubin innocent and get him out of jail.<br />&quot;Hate put me in prison, but love's gonna bust me out...&quot;<br />-The most memorable words from a powerful performance by Denzel Washington.  This emotional story pits him at a high ranking for some of the best acting in his career.  The problem with this film is its predictability, regardless of hearing this story before, its false characters, and its overlong plot which could've been shortened up.<br />Another problem with this film is how it flashes back in time, back further, and back, then back to reality.  The beginning is just Denzel getting all ready like he's going out to the ring, (in his prison cell), saying- &quot;Come on.  I'll take you all on... I won't take no sh-t.&quot;  Then we go back to his boxing career, and da da da da.  It bothered me.<br />This drama shifts both to pros and cons uprises and downfalls.  Partly because you feel so bad for this man who's been in prison over half of his life simply because of racism.  Yet, this story is profound and doesn't have any means to leave you with sad boredom.  It's an epic story of friendship and never giving up when the impossibilities seems greater than ever.  It ends in a solid, regardless of how drawn out the film is.<br />There is fire, there is fury, there is a powerhouse performance from Denzel Washington, there is drama- there is nothing to back it up...  The slowness and confusion of where we are in time will detract from this film and you may enjoy it, but you will still have seconds thoughts in the back of your mind.  And for those of you who know the story anyways- there isn't much point in seeing the movie, because the film is very fictionalized.  Try reading Rubin's book, or read biography and/or documentrary.  Then, if you need more, try THE HURRICANE.  Overall, it is a worth-while film I suppose.
B000003S0B|3.0|What does a band do when it is expected to complement its much-admired debut but is breaking apart? King Crimson's guitarist, Robert Fripp and lyricist, Peter Sinfeld, the only members who still gave a damn about the band, decided on trying to duplicate that debut. After the 49-second intro, \\"Peace: A Beginning,\\" 1970's In the Wake of Poseidon's first side draws an unmistakable parallel to that of  1969's In the Court of the Crimson King. The devious, saxophone-laced assault of \\"Pictures of a City\\" sounds a great deal like \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" the solemn \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" is very similar to \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" and the title track is an obvious mimic of \\"Epitaph.\\" Founding members were departing and sometimes rejoining and newcomers were being rushed in to complete the album throughout its recording and mirroring In the Court of the Crimson King was presumably the only way the band's two steady members could be sure of the results. The songs they composed are not significantly inferior to their prototypes, but shouldn't we expect more? On the album's second side it gains its own wings. By being their quirkiest, \\"Cat Food\\" is the strangest song Crimson recorded to date and \\"Devil's Triangle\\" is a fine, classical-infused, sprawling instrumental. In the Wake of Poseidon is often it is a too much like its predecessor. But after half the band walked out, midrecording, it is about the strongest work one could expect.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Although made in the 1970's with some odd move ideas this film has got to be one of the most orignal and most hilarious movies my eyes have ever witnessed. The absolute plan of this film is brillant and its a shame we dont see slapstick comedy so unbashedly making fun of itself so the audience will enjoy it.<BR>Overall this movie is a comic gem and should be in any comedy lovers closet as a fun romp. <br />By the way im a 16 year old student.
0375703764|5.0|Mark Danielewski manages to spin an intriguing tale of horror that takes the genre in new directions while remaining loyal to its roots. Danielewski is clearly influenced by the alternate dimensions and nameless horrors of H.P. Lovecraft, as well as the classic horror device of narration in journal or epistolary form, takes these classics of the genre in an entirely new direction.<br />Danielewski is able to fully form the characters while narrating the tale through both a first person narrator and an omniscient view, a trick that he handles well and rather than being distracting, as multiple narration is in so many novels, it adds to the plot's development.  The story is narrated through a format that is new to the genre-revision of an academic analysis of a film that is, of course, fictional.<br />The side aspects of the novel-Johnny Truant's adventures as he uncovers the Navidson Narrative, Danielewski's satirical rendition of postmodern academic criticism, his formatting choices-all serve to enhance the mood of the main story, the haunted hallway, and far from detracting from the novel, make it what is: a brilliant revision of the classic horror novel, setting it apart from the genre while enhancing it.<br />The novel really put me on the cliched &quot;edge of my seat&quot;, and I thought as a longtime horror fan I was beyond being scared! The mixture of suspense, mystery, and fear is excellent, as is the novel's mixture of sci-fi and horror, and reality and fiction. Danielewski uses a similar reality device to the film &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; but with much greater success and before the film, proving once again that the best artistic ideas originate in literature. Danielewski's novel is a terrific one that any horror fan, new or continuing, will enjoy and be thrilled by. This text will, I believe, redefine the genre as a whole.  I highly recommend it.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|In listening to this album, I am amazed at some of the songs that are on it -- and not on it.  I think it is dangerous to do an album of songs that were #1, because along with the true classics you also get the odd bunch that made #1 for a brief period due to lack of competition in the marketplace.  <br />Day Tripper?  The Ballad of John &amp; Yoko? How appalling the music scene must have been in these weeks in the 1960s.  <br />Not one song from Sgt. Pepper? This really leaves a hole in any anthology.  Must have been some good albums out at that time.  <br />The album is good overall, though, and it does provide a good one disc trip through all of the Beatles' stylistic changes.  Pleasant to listen to.
B00005JHAD|2.0|okay,lets count the cliches: a heist movie that rips off scenes from other movies far superior than it, stylized,hip gangsters, moral ambiguity where everyone's a victim but no one's innocent, cool camera angles we've been seeing since Reservior Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and finally, a  smattering of hip hop flava. At some point I am confident this fad will run it's course. But until then, i am sure we'll see a lot more of these lumps of coal.
0743507886|4.0|Like millions, I am enjoying the HBO series, 'Band of Brothers'.  To expand my enjoyment, and learn more about Easy Company, I listened to the audio version of the book.  It is a great complement to the series.  The tape demonstrates HBO is following the true heroics of these soldiers.  It adds more information and reveals deeper emotions than these excellent actors can portray.  The narration accentuates the action and miseries.  Sure, we can replay our video tapes.  I recommend you buy the tape and discover more enjoyment and appreciation for E Company and their sacrifices.
B00005OWIU|4.0|This CD is by my favorite composer John Williams, so naturally I went right out to buy it. When I popped the cd into my player I was immeaditly treated to a somewhat spooky mystical theme of hand chimes. Harry Potter has a theme that borrows a little from many of Williams movies, like Star Wars. The Songs range from spooky, to triumphant. For example, in quidtich match, you feel like you are right in the book/movei, playing along with Harry! It is exciting, fast paced, and descriptice music. You can imagine every score, every foul, and anything else inbetween! But my favorite song of all is number 19, Hedwig's Theme. It starts off with more chimes, and has a very good trumpet part in it. The best part is at the end where the entire orchestra plays a magnificent fanfare closing to an end, the movie. There are some down sides however.  Some of the songs seem to ramble on with out much happening. I found myself tuning out and focusing on something else instead of listening. But over all, it is a good CD for Williams fans, and Potter fans alike. I suggest it to just about everyone I know!
B000050XEI|4.0|Enya's music has the ability to captivate anyone with her beautiful voice and new age harmonies, a unique style that derived largely from her time with celtic band Clannad. This album, the first original one she put in the market in five years, is no exception to the rule.<br />Although I loved it, I'm not giving it five stars, because the sound seems to have got a bit stuck within the same style. Don't get me wrong: it's a great album (a little short too, but well...) If you've already heard Enya material before (such as &quot;Watermark&quot; of &quot;Shepherd Moons,&quot; both of which I highly recommend), it brings nothing new. However it's beautiful
B00003CY0V|4.0|I can usually figure out the endings to most &quot;ingenious criminal with hostages&quot; movies, and this one was almost one of them. Fortunately, it was fresh and unique enough to satisfy my tough standards. I'm not one to give away endings to even very old movies, so read on without fear of important spoilers.<br />The deal? There is $9+ billion in old, unused, Government money, and Travolta's character wants it to help funding....oh, wait, he doesn't reveal what he's funding until the middle of the movie. So all I'll reveal is that Travolta's character has some interesting friends.<br />John Travolta does a great job playing the mastermind of a scheme to nap billions in old Govenment money. And Hugh Jackman is almost perfect as the brilliant Computer Hacker who's main motivation is just wanting to be a Father to his Daughter. (it's not revealing too much to say that his dishonorable job has nothing but honorable motives behind it)The only thing that I didn't like about his performance, was that I noticed some spots where his pronunciation of some of the same words changed, which reminded me he was an Australian playing an American. (He nailed the American dialect in X-Men though, so I know he's capable)<br />Don Cheadle, an actor who has so far never disappointed me with his performances, plays it just hot tempered enough with a cool manner, as the FBI Agent trying to figure out and foil Travolta's plans.<br />Halle Berry, sadly, failed to impress me very much with her performance. It was obvious to me that she did very little to prepare for the role. (I personally think Pam Grier would have brought more to the role, but maybe Pam would have passed on the role due to the odd &quot;reading a book while topless&quot; scenes)<br />By the way, in the scene when Travolta tells Jackman go for a drive with him, DO NOT MOVE! I won't give anything away, JUST STAY SEATED and you'll be blown away by what happens!<br />I loved the way the movie opened, Travolta's monologue was incredible! BUT, they showed too much after that given that it's all a scene that shows what happens near the end of the film! So you already know pretty much who is still alive, giving the &quot;is he/she about to die?&quot; scenes throughout the movie far less power.<br />I personally recommend renting or buying the DVD version, not only because the action looks better on it, but there are some really nice bonus goodies on it, like THREE alternate endings, which answered a couple of questions I personally had.<br />All in all, I highly recommend this film, and have already added it to my DVD collection.ble!

B000059MEK|2.0|I bought this album out of curiosity, after I had heard the opening track, &quot;One More Time.&quot; That ONE track was awesome, but I was dissapointed to find out that the rest of the album is very, very similar in sound. I think they're beeing overrated. Sorry... I know I might be offending some of their fans, but I really didn't like this work. As I said in the title of the review, I sold it. I give it 2.5 stars.
B00000I2UE|5.0|Darklands is pure genious - from the first note of the opening track to the very last sound of 'About You'. This is one of the albums I could not live without. While 'Psycho Candy' was a fantastic debut, 'Darklands' just blew me away. 'April Skies' and 'Happy when it rains' were two grandiose singles, released prior to 'Darklands', and there is not a bad song on this entire album. The first time I put this LP on my turntable was back in 1987 and I have listened to it at least once a month every year since then. Your CD collection will not be complete without this album !
B00003CX9Q|1.0|The fact that they went back into the movie and changed all the guns the officers were carrying (when chasing the kids) to walkie-talkies is bad enough. The fact that they actually edited out the line the mother tells her son ( &quot;No, you're<BR>not going as a terrorist.&quot; ) just ruins it for me.  When I buy a special edition DVD I get it to get the original shots, not something that has been hacked and slashed to approval of censors. Definitely Thumbs Down.
B000007WNN|5.0|When 'Electric' came out, the 'Goth' followers of 'Love' and 'Dreamtime' were shocked and in rage. How could 'The Cult' release such a follow up to their classic hits like 'Rain' or 'She sells sanctuary' ? Almost 25 years later we finally know the answer by being able to hear, what this album was supposed to sound like, since the original mix is included in the 'Rare Cult' box set. Being able to compare these two versions proves even more the genious of Rick Rubin. 'Love Removal Machine' would have been a heavy, multi layered, dark eighties anthem while Rubin's production transferred this track to a timeless rock classic. This whole album is full of energy, thanks to Rick Rubin's production and the great songwriting of Billy Duffy and Ian Asburry. 'Li'l Devil' is pure adrenaline, 'Wild Flower' is the Cult at their best and 'Memphis Hip Shake' closes this album like there is no tomorrow. While America was considering the stadium rock of 'Bon Jovi' or 'Poison' as the future of rock, 'The Cult' together with Rick Rubin took a step back and created a classic British rock album. Unfortunately, 'The Cult' focused on the American market afterwards and released more mainstream oriented records like 'Sonic Temple' or 'Ceremony'.
6305531374|4.0|First off, H20 is probably the third best in the series, next to the first two of course.  The movie is filled with tension, genuine scares, and a fine cast.  Like I said in the title, director Steve Miner forgets the moronic plots of parts 3-6 (the cults, Thorn God etc.) and instead concentrates on Michael and Laurie.<BR><BR>Michael is the same, undying psycho we knew and loved the original, and Jamie Lee Curtis is still a compelling heroine. Michael has always been the most effective boogeyman in horror history, and he lives up to the title here. He induces goosebumps in several scenes, such as the cafeteria, when he starts flipping tables, to the kitchen and the garbage disposal.  I don't want to give too much away, but the Halloween series hasn't had this many memorable moments since part 2.<BR><BR>My only gripe about this movie really has nothing to do with the movie itself.  H20 would have had more impact and suspense if it didn't have so many doofy sequels preceding it. If it had only been the first two and then H20, it would have made Michael's return so much more exciting. Bottom line, this movie and the first two are the best movies in the series, and the only ones you need to see.
0679744959|5.0|I work in a very slow office at a prison.  I got into the habit of carrying novels to work with me.  An inmate suggested that I read Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe.  I took his suggestion and was hooked after a few pages.  I couldn't put it down.  I laughed and cried and copied down the recipes from the last few pages.  If you haven't read this book, I strongly suggest that you check it out from your local library.  Give it a try.  You won't be sorry, and like me, you'll want to try the recipes as soon as you can!
B000002KB8|4.0|I have to laugh when people downplay this album and go after later Sabbath(Ozzy era) records.  This isin't as sludgy as Paranoid or Master of reality but it certainly rocks.  This is Sabbath at their absolute bluesiest and it sure is fun to play this stuff loud.  Though not that imprest with the dark title track(Black Sabbath), my ears perked up to that harmonica intro on Wizard.  The next song, or should I say songs(It's four songs but they all appera as track 3 on your cd player) are very diverse.  Though I'm not sure wich is wich, I love wall of sleep and especially N.I.B.  Those two songs are two of Sabbath's gems.  Wall of sleep is somewhat of a forgotten Sabbath tune, even among Sabbath fans!  N.I.B is the song that most new fans hear or download first(little do they know what they're getting themsleves into.  Wicked world is an average tune at best but the album surely picks up again with the bluesy bliss of Warning.  <br />So there you have it, not as complexe as some Sabbath, not the heaviest eithet but definetly the most fun.
B000000WJ2|4.0|&quot;Main Offender&quot;, Keith's second solo album shows once again why he is a living legend. The album starts off with &quot;999&quot; which is a good rockin' tune to set the tone for the album. &quot;Eileen&quot; is the song from this album that most people will be familiar with and it is a good song in itself. Other standouts are &quot;Wicked As It Seems&quot;, &quot;Words of Wonder&quot;, &quot;Yap Yap&quot;, &quot;Hate It When You Leave&quot; and &quot;Will But You Wont&quot;. Only reason it didnt get 5 stars is that a few of the songs here I didnt find that moving while on his first album i thought every song was a great one. Still I am very happy to have this album and I think any Keith Richards or Stones fan for that matter will enjoy it also.
B00003CX8J|4.0|This is not a great movie, but it is entertaining in a quality campy sort of way.  It also spends much time setting up the characters - allowing for more interesting sequels.
B000000WGL|5.0|I am a big Keith fan and I was glad that I got this disc. Some of the work by the Stones were lacking in intensity, but on &quot;Talk Is Cheap&quot;, Keith shows us why he is the fuel that runs the Rolling Stones machine. This disc is straight ahead, stripped down Rock at its best. &quot;Big Enough&quot; is a pretty surprise here it has a good funky beat. &quot;Take It So Hard&quot;, &quot;I Could Have Stood You Up&quot; and &quot;Whip It Up&quot; are some great rocking tunes. &quot;Locked Away&quot; is a awesome ballad that will move you. On the song &quot;You Don't Move Me&quot;, Keith gets to take a swing at Mick for how he thinks about his acting and all around behavior at that time. If you are a true fan of music, I don't think that you will be disappointed with this disc.
B000002LQR|5.0|What I mean is that I put this CD on when I need to get into an energetic place in order to do some cleaning.  I do love the album even when I am not feeling the (always distant) urge to dust and vacuum, but the energy that Red Hot Chili Peppers packs on to this album always gets me moving.  Between the Chili Peppers and No Doubt, my floors stay in the acceptable range of housekeeping.
0792151712|2.0|The highly overrated movie Titanic won the hearts of movie-goers all over the world. The story is not really about the tragedy that happened on the Titanic virgintrip but is basicaly a Romeo and Juliet love story. The story about impossible love as Jack Dawson(DiCaprio) falls in love with the socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet) and the impossible love between the poor Jack and the rich and soon to be married Rose, and how they try to defy the will of Rose's family and her (villainous) husband-to-be. As for the ship we all know the ending, as for the main characters it is not my job to tell here. This is really a movie aimed at romance loving, female, moviegoers. As for the rest of us the movie is like candyfloss it is great at first but soon it becomes sickening sweet. As for the movie as whole, it is well construced, the special effects are good(with a few exeptions) and it hits right where it was intended. I personaly don't know what was worst. The movie or Camerons speech when he got an Oscar.
B000002NBY|5.0|I cannot begin a road trip without first checking to make sure that I have my Graceland CD.  My father had the cassette when the album was first released and we would pop it into the player on every single trip.  My brother and I knew all the words to every song and would sing along at what was, most likely, a desperately unpleasant volume.  It is a wonder that our parents still speak to us.<br />Simon has brought back african roots music and incorporated it into a rock/folk mix that worked when it was released and still works now.  The lyrics are classic Paul Simon poetry and range from concerns about the modern world to human relationships.  Some how he makes all of this very personal, so you feel as if you are getting a glimpse into his life.  I don't love it due to sentiment; I love it because it is a fantastic, well made album.
B000005J56|5.0|This masterful album should be in everyone's essential CD file.  I think that the only reason that it isn't is that not everyone has heard it yet.  But each friend who hears it, buys it.  It is just that good.  On a hot summer day, when a humid breeze is blowing, pop on this CD to take you out of your life and plop you into the streets of Cuba.  You will smell the cigars and taste the rum.  I promise.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Ok, the weaknesses of Phantom Menace are well known, so I won't go into pointing out the weaknesses in it.  The DVD has some really nice features, particularly alot of the bonus material that was added.  Still, some of the menus are so filled with flash that it slows down getting to what you want to see (For example rather than give you a good decent list of the deleted scenes, you have to view the name of the scenes one at a time).  My biggest gripe is the fact that Lucas changed the film on the DVD so that it is different than the one on VHS or appeared in the theater.  While the additional scenes were nice, a DVD that does not explicitly name itself as a director's cut should at least give the viewer the option to see the film the way it was originally presented (for an example of how that is done very effectively see the Abyss DVD, while I much prefer the Director's Cut, it is nice to be able to see the original).
B000059ZT4|5.0|First off all the Unrealesed version is awesome.  It has slightly different versions of the ones on the original album, but all the songs are great.  There are two songs on the Unrealesed album that are not on the original album.  Hide Tide, Or Low Tide, and All Day, All Night.  There both great songs and should have been on the original release.  Overall the two albums are excellent.  My favorite of Bob Marley. And i'm a HUGE Bob Marley fan.  So buy this album.  You WONT regret.  Because Bob Marley is a LEGEND.
1573221562|5.0|I loved &quot;Affinity&quot; more than Ms. Waters' first book.  The ending, the gripping feelings and the imagery of this book are just plain unforgettable.  I find myself revisiting the story over and over in my head.  I can't wait for the next book!
B00004T40X|5.0|If it weren't for my internet friends recommending this band to me, I would never have heard of this band.  I'm glad I discovered them.  I first bought &quot;Silence&quot;, which I loved, great album, but I still HAD to get this one.  So, I finally get it.  Wow!  Great stuff!  The thing that really got me interested in this band to begin with was the comparisons to Dream Theater, which I totally hear.  Great guitar/keyboard solos, tight drums (pun intended), and great vocals.  I like how the guy can go from a high voice, to this weird deeper voice.  He sounds really cool both ways.  &quot;My Land&quot; is a great mid-paced, melodic rocker, probably my fave.  &quot;Replica&quot; is a godly ballad, although &quot;Letter to Dana&quot; is a little goofy.  I like the Irish flavor, though.  &quot;Blank File&quot; and &quot;8th Commandment&quot; are really fast and energetic, and &quot;Full Moon&quot; is just a fun song (although I think he should have said IN the sky instead of ON the sky).  All in all, a great album, with a feel that's nearly indescribable.  I like albums with feels. I'm not a huge fan of symphonic power metal (Hammerfall, Stratovarius), I generally prefer the heavier stuff, like Iced Earth and Iron Maiden, but this is by far the best power metal album of that nature I have heard, and one of the best albums in general.  You would be wise to buy this.  The only bad thing is that they didn't put their full names in the book.  Oh well.  Buy this, buy it now!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Bob Dylan is so far beyond anyone else in music,  it is scary.  &quot;Love and Theft&quot; lets us peek into the mind of a genius.  How he coalesces sounds of old with something entirely new sends shivers up one's spine.  The marriage of musicality, winding, whispery words, and voice of wisdom and life is as beautiful as the winds rustling through the trees on a sunny day.  Bob has truly painted a picture (a masterpiece)of beauty with his latest, &quot;Love and Theft.&quot;  Thanks Bob.
0451523938|3.0|Though i thoroughly enjoyed the book, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. This piece of fiction, set in a realistic town, contains the story of a respectable Doctor, Henry Jekyll, and a strange other man, Edward Hyde, as seen from the eyes of Gabriel Utterson. You see, the good doctor has been missing lately, and he has been acting rather strangely as well. It appears that whenever Dr. Jekyll is missing, everything should be placed in the hands of Mr. Hyde. This particularly surprises Mr. Utterson, who has been friends with the doctor for years, and is confused as to why Jekyll leaves things in the hands of Mr. Hyde. However, after a maid witnesses Mr. Hyde has _murdered_ someone, the strange man is nowhere to be found! Instead, Dr. Jekyll has returned after a long absence. How very peculiar... <BR>Though this book may have seemed simple in the way I spelled it out, it is written in a most confusing manner. The book is partially written in a normal story way, but then, near the end (last 20-25 pages) are written from someone else's point of view in a narrative style. All in all, I found it to be a good story, written a confusing way.
B000002KCV|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I get a kick from hearing Neil rock, and appreciate &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand&quot; and &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot; as much as anyone. But for some reason, I always find myself coming back to this country/acoustic-flavored gem, and probably listen to it more than to any other of Young's numerous fine offerings. Maybe it's because I'm about the same age as he was when he recorded this, or maybe I'm just getting to appreciate the quieter side of life now that I have a young child. Either way, I find songs like &quot;Going Back,&quot; &quot;Comes A Time,&quot; and &quot;Human Highway&quot; just perfect. They bring me back to the late 70's, when I was a kid, even though I never heard these songs until I was an adult, and remind me of how simple and peaceful life seemed back then. Other standouts are &quot;Look Out For My Love,&quot; &quot;Already One&quot; - which can bring tears to my eyes even though I've never been through a divorce - and Neil's terrific cover of &quot;Four Strong Winds.&quot; This is Neil's best acoustic album, ahead of Harvest Moon and Harvest.
1878424319|5.0|I cannot express my gratitude in words for this gift from don Miguel.  It is the most useful book I have ever owned.  I bought all of don Miguel's books and read them often.  They inspire me---and yet they are totally practical books.  I've experienced wonders in my life after practicing, practicing, practicing these agreements.  Thank you, don Miguel!
6301967992|4.0|I first saw this movie when I was about 11 years old.  I loved it so much that, 30 years later, I still remembered it.  We rented it recently and, to my dismay, it had been colorized.  The original black and white version is MUCH better, but the film is still great fun.  The bumbling professor and his associate are hilarious, and the innkeeper turned vampire still makes me laugh.  If you're looking for depth, look elsewhere.  But if you're looking for campy spoof, this is one must-see film.
B00004U30D|4.0|Although somewhat depressing to some audience members, I found this movie interesting and innovative.  &quot;American Beauty&quot;, like no other film of its time, presents a bluntly realistic portrayal of American society.  The movie creates a category of its own by confronting such touchy issues as adultry, homosexuality, drug trade, depression, and sexual desires.  Not only does the movie make a person think of the somewhat twisted world we live in, but it also makes one think of the tremendous amounts of everyday beauty in the chaotic world around us. American Beauty resides as a revolutionary film for not only confronting the sometimes realistically depressing facets of society but for also showing a touch of hope in the small sparks of everyday beauty.
068484267X|5.0|&quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is the best memoir I have read since Dave Eggers' &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,&quot; though the books are hardly comparable.  In this book, Frank McCourt has delivered an entertaining and poignant work.  Not having seen the movie or heard anything about the book, I had no idea what it was about until I began reading.  I was quickly reeled in by McCourt's smooth narration and dialogue as he described his childhood, first in New York City, where he was born, and then back in Ireland, where his family moved when Frank was still young.  McCourt does a wonderful job of describing his poverty-stricken upbringing without seeming to fish for sympathy.  I really enjoyed the insight into the plight of the Irish poor in the mid-20th century.  But it was the anecdotes and daily activities that McCourt writes about that kept me most entertained.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and highly recommend it to all.
B00004W5UB|5.0|Fight Club provides an alternative perspective on the world we live in -- a VERY alternative perspective.  The first time I saw this movie, it scared me to death.  Confused, I left the theater, continuing my attempt to understand the meaning behind all the gore.  I was too fascinated to leave it alone so I saw the movie many more times, each time seeing it in a new light.  Ed Norton's character satirized the place we work, the mail order catologues we drool over, and the support groups that we so dearly depend on.  While on a plane, he even adresses the &quot;single servings&quot; of condoments and beverages and the like, while at the same time identifying Brad Pitt's character as a &quot;single serving&quot; friend.  Ed Norton's character endures struggles at work and with insomnia, and throughout the movie helearns, with the brutal tutelage of Brad Pitt, that his life is not a tragedy and he has to learn to live life for what it is.  He discards the value of material objects and things of the sort.  Brad Pitt's character wishes to be &quot;delivered from clear skin and perfect teeth,&quot; meaning these things are not truly important entities in life.  Even though this movie is a challege to watch and endure, the message it delivers is worth it.

My copy is fair, the DVD has multiple blips and the color seems to red.  I don't remember this in the film.<br />It seems this is the ist issue and we will be seeing a &quot;cleaner&quot; release with additional items.<br />Itis still worth the price and something you can enjoy many times.
0451523938|4.0|Evil lurks inside the man, chomping at the bit for its first chance to escape, but his conscience keeps him from carrying out his cruel and undignified desires.  In Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the reader is presented with an enthralling vision of a failed experiment in which a man attempts to separate his pure, angelic qualities and his dark, wicked inward wishes into two individual beings.  A variable is horribly miscalculated, and instead of ending up with two embodiments, he only ends up with his evil side, which comes to be known as Edward Hyde, and his own self, a compound of a wholesome conscience and a hidden-away, satanic instinct which is part of all human beings.  Definitely a book that can be viewed in a depressing, \\"can't-ignore-the-truth\\" type of light, this novel may set some readers in a direction that has them recognizing other parts of their own personality.<BR> The story is set in London, England, in a 19th-century time period.  I choose to view it as an example of a sci-fi horror novel.  It's quite different from other chillers because of its lack of a murderer or a dangerous villain per se that everyone's hiding from.  Oh, sure, Edward Hyde commits acts of horrific atrocity, but if you look beyond the hard, cold facts, you realize that these criminal acts are not the true object of the plot.  The actual villain in this book is meant to be portrayed as the volatile human soul.  The novel shows how dangerous some evil desires of even the kindest, most generous people can be.  Take for instance Henry Jekyll, the main character of this book.  He's as compassionate and gentle a person as you'll ever meet, but through Edward Hyde, he commits unforgivable acts that you would never have thought of Jekyll.  It's a twisted version of the relationship between Superman and Clark Kent, his alter ego.  In the form of Superman, Kent goes around the planet saving people and taking criminals to jail.  In the form of Edward Hyde, Jekyll goes around trampling childrenand beating kindly old gentleman with canes for no apparent reason, then makes up for the crimes by taking money out of Henry Jekyll's bank account.<BR> The characters in this book are quite a diverse crew.  Instead of the predictable situation with the mad scientist, the damsel in distress, and the dashing hero, this novel features a troubled, kind scientist, his worried friends the lawyer (Mr. Utterson) and the butler (Poole), and an old acquaintance of the doctor's (Hastie Lanyon) that had a quarrel with Jekyll over some sort of scientific matter, creating a certain thickness between them.  Finally, you have the scientist's alter ego, Edward Hyde, a hideous, small young man.  Utterson is a lean, serious man that never smiles.  \\"I incline to Cain's heresy; I let my brother go to the devil in his own way,\\" says Utterson drearily.  This is taken to mean that he only wants to worry about his own business, and nobody else's.  Poole is not described in great lengths in this book; he is a friendly, elderly servant of Dr. Jekyll's.  Later in the book, Lanyon is implored by Jekyll, trapped in the form of Hyde, possibly for life, to get him the necessary drugs to temporarily change back.  Lanyon meets a sad death.<BR> This book is excellently written, although its length is quite miniscule (70 pages).  Robert Louis Stevenson integrates a sense of mystery into the plot, and although most educated persons know the basic story, you will still find yourself bristling with anticipation.  Rarely does that suspense turn into boredom, as it does quite frequently in Bram Stoker's novel Dracula and many older works of horror.  The reader is easily able to tell the difference between the voice tones of different characters, e.g. when Henry Jekyll tells his tragic story at the end.  His sophisticated language is effortlessly distinguished from that of others who may have entries.  Stevenson's dark and detailed descriptions of cold, deserted streets may give you chills as you are sucked into his vivid yet sinister worlds.<BR> If I hadn't been forced to read this book by a certain time, I still might have picked it up off the shelf and read it eventually.  That's achieving a point of loftiness with me, because I tend to be quite impatient with my books, wanting instant gratification of my needs for action and plot twists.  It's very difficult to compare this book to works of other genres.  Many other novels don't implement suspense because it's not needed.  This book, however, is based on suspense.  It's easy to hold the audience's attention here because of the shortness, but that doesn't mean that Stevenson did a cheesy job with the elements of the story.  Much is packed into this dwarf of a book, and anybody who needs (or wants, for that matter) suspense in their life should pick it up
B00004OCRN|5.0|Crank up the amp for 'Be True'. Bruce accompanied by 'The Miami Horns' and his great band is a live cut for the ages.<br />It's a song that lifts you up, so that you'll want to play it again to keep the high.<br />Highly recommended, especially because of the Horn Section!
B0000025KI|5.0|Only one cd (well, 2 discs if you want to get technical!) can not only serve as the perfect, bouncy, fun soundtrack to a blue collar 4th of July barbecue, but also be the one that picks you up when you are down, with comforting words and empathy. And that one (okay fine, 2!) cd(s) is &quot;the River&quot;.<BR>It's not enough that Bruce is handsome, talented and has a great band to back him up. It's not enough that his ever devoted fan base grew exponentially with this CD's release! But Bruce is going to do even more!<BR>Songs like The Ties that Bind, Sherry Darling, Crush on You, Ramrod, etc. are fun for a 4th of July picnic or some other summertime activites. And when I feel sad and alone, it's the empathy in Point Blank, and the soothing comfort of Drive all Night that make me feel better. Hearing Bruce tell me (in Drive All Night) &quot;Don't worry darling...girl, you've got my love&quot;, reminds me that I can always turn to him, no matter what, and he'll comfort me. So true! I know his other 'devout' fans agree with me. <BR>Bruce is the one true rock star, and I encourage everyone to buy this album. You will probably fall in love.....
B0000026J6|5.0|Only Mr. Cohen could write a lyric like that. I rarely listen to cds for the words but this one made me listen. Cohen is also underrated as a musician and producer. A good example would be the song &quot;First we take Manhattan&quot;. One of the best songwriters in the history of music for sure. &quot;The Future&quot; is next.
B00005OAE6|4.0|Bob Seger followed up his classic breakthough 1976 album &quot;Night Moves&quot; with the solid &quot;Stranger in Town,&quot; which solidified his position as the best blue collar American rock and roller not named Bruce Springsteen.  A number of these songs have become classic rock staples, particularly the anthemic &quot;Old Time Rock and Roll,&quot; &quot;Hollywood Nights,&quot; &quot;Still the Same,&quot; and the ballad &quot;We've Got Tonight.&quot;  First rate album cuts also include the rocking &quot;Feel Like a Number,&quot; &quot;Ain't Got No Money&quot; and another good ballad in &quot;The Famous Final Scene.&quot;  Though it is a bit more polished (and therefore not a powerful) as &quot;Night Moves,&quot; &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; is still a first rate album that will be enjoyed by any classic rock fan.
B000024D4R|5.0|if you don't have this album you are missing one of pink floyd's best.  the wall is number one with animals tied for second with wish you were here.  the reason i can't get this one out of my stereo is the song &quot;dogs&quot;.  this is one of the greatest lead guitar songs of all time!  after an exciting solo that leads into another verse the upbeat driving tempo switches to a more relaxed &quot;half time&quot; beat to begin the instrumental section of &quot;dogs&quot;.  that is when it .... happens.  two harmonized guitars bending a melody together that, along with a trance-like bed of keyboards, create what i describe as a sweeping vision of far away sadness.  like reaching for something and shunning it at the same time, this dual solo (with a third guitar answering the phrase) is the highlight of the album.  it is one of the great guitar moments in rock.  along with the middle lead work in &quot;peace of mind&quot; by boston, it remains a moment of yearning where i wish the guitar was one of the instruments i play.  that being said, david gilmour follows with possibly his best lyrical lead of all time.  the following track &quot;pigs&quot; is great to sing along to.  &quot;sheep&quot; isn't my favorite but is still a good finale.  i'm so glad to have this album and &quot;dogs&quot; will always be one of my top floyd songs.  also, check out les claypool's fearless flying frog brigade.  their second live album is 45 minutes of them covering the entire animals disc!  the frog brigade pays homage to floyd's masterpiece almost note for note!
B00001NFCY|5.0|Calling this a &quot;grunge&quot; album is very simplistic.  This band and this album have far more elements to their sound beyond that overrated early '90s sound.  There are elements of guitar rock along with an almost spiritual feeling in spots.<br />Clearly this album is poppier than its predecessor, but it is truly fantastic.  For sure &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; is one of the best singles of the past decade--a beautiful and moving song.  &quot;Higher&quot; is a great hit as well that also rocks.  &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;What If&quot; are quality rock tracks that were also released.  &quot;Beautiful&quot; is just that--a beautiful track.  The most affecting track of all to me is &quot;Wash Away Those Years&quot;--a hauntingly beautiful song with a sad, emotional message.<br />It took me many years to accept the fact that '80s melodic rock was buried by an inferior (in my opinion) brand of rock in the '90s.  Albums such as this, however, make me realize that some worthy music did in fact come from that decade.  Clearly, this is one of the best, most enjoyable, most meaningful popular albums from that time.  Call it 4 3/4 stars for a truly superior effort for its time.
B000000HTM|5.0|Pawn Hearts was a challenging listen on its release back in the early 70s, and it is no less today.<br />Though they are generally associated with the Euro-Prog camp, Van Der Graaf Generator were definitely (and definedly) their own sort of group.  Unlike Yes, Genesis, ELP, etc, the emphasis was more on expression than instrumental virtuosity.  Musically they did employ a unique approach to song structure, but the execution was more loose, more raw, maybe not so pleasing much of the time.  Given the nature of Peter Hammill's agonized lyrical visions, as well as the conflict-ravaged history of the group itself, these dark, chaotic elements somehow work in this release's favor, producing a most extraordinary and unforgettable listen ..... if you can take it.<br />Closer to the aesthetic viscera of King Crimson (but not as blatantly experimental), the album even features a brief appearance by Robert Fripp (on &quot;Man-Erg&quot;), lending sonic divergence to a lineup that otherwise features no lead guitar to speak of.  The themes of the songs mostly concern death, societal ruination, personal duality, self-doubt and neurosis, with maybe a dim shimmer of hope breaking through.  Songwriter/vocalist Hammill sounds almost like a tortured David Bowie (not a criticism), fluctuating between tender melodic mastery and shamelessly baring his inflamed tonsils to the world in performance.  The words themselves are introspective, emotional, mostly dark and cut very deep, betraying a vulnerability few singers would want to reveal.  As stated earlier, not the easiest listen at times, but a damn good exorcism in its own way.<br />This band nearly broke up before their very first studio release, &quot;The Aerosol Gray Machine&quot;, and by all reports was in constant danger of dissolvement all through their career.  The fact that they managed to release what they did (some 7-8 albums) is a testament to their determination to overcome adversity as well as to the support of just enough hard-core enthusiasts.  Though later releases exhibited a tad more polish, I would have to call Pawn Hearts the defining VDGG work, in terms of both vision and execution ..... one of the most musical primal screams you could squeeze from your speakers.  Brace yourself and enjoy.hard-core enthusiasts.

0395759242|5.0|To use the old cliche: when I read this book I could barely put it down. At times I was angry and other times bewillered about how the genocide of a people could take place and then be systemically denied for so many years. Throughout my reading about Africa, I never knew about the Belgium atrocities under Leopold's rule until I read this book. It seems like this part of history has been kept well hidden. Perhaps because it personifies the history of European rule and exploitation of Africa for over four hundred years.<br />Hoschcild's narrative is both passionate, engrossing, and vivid. He doesn't seek to make apologies for Leopold's atrocities. He doesn't understate the killing of over 5 million Congolese Africans for the profit and wealth of a King and his estate.<br />At the same time, he reveals the couregous work that was done by activists like the American born African Reverend William H. Sheppard whose writing documenting the brutality of the Congo state made him the object of a lawsuit and trail because he stood up against the colonial empire.<br />&quot;King Leopold's Ghost&quot; will be informative to both those knowledgable of European domination of Africa, and to those who are just beginning to do the research. This book will be a classic in African history.
B00005QIPH|4.0|A ton of hype is surrounding this NYC 5-piece. And with that has come the inevitable backlash. Bottom line: this a really, really good hook-filled rock record. Their influences are worn boldly on their sleeves (Television, Velvet Underground, Talking Heads) but so what? reminds me of another excellent and very promising debut by another young band with obvious influences: Supergrass. Yeah, I'll call them the Supergrass of New York City. Good stuff - can't wait to see how their music evolves on future releases.
B000002UAI|3.0|This is a quality album. The punishment of the Beatles' schedule probably contributed to the inclusion of six covers here, but the covers are not bad as some have suggested. 'Rock and Roll Music' particularly stand out among them.<br />Above all, the originals here are first rate early compositions. 'Eight Days a Week' was slated to be the Christmas single of 1964 as they prepared to release this album, but John Lennon simply came up with 'I feel Fine' overnight. Clearly it was a fertile period for their songwriting. 'No Reply' and 'I'm a Loser' foreshadowed the introspective songwriting that was to soon to come from Lennon. And as far as relatively unknown Beatles' songs go, I absolutely love 'What You're Doing.'<br />Nevertheless, this was a step backwards after &quot;A Hard Day's Night.&quot; The release of this album was just too rushed. The band would not repeat this mistake again until the end of their career.
B000002UA9|3.0|This is, put simply, a good debut album. With this album the Beatles began showing other artists that they could write their own material.<br />Recored in one long day, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; is the rawest of all the Beatles' albums. There are some great covers here; 'Twist and Shout' would be the Beatles' closing song in concert for quite a long time afterwards. The reason why the covers sound so accomplished is that the the boys had been performing them for years. 'Chains' and 'Anna' also work wonderfully. With their covers, the Beatles showed America its' own musical roots.<br />It was, of course, the originals that showed the Beatles' promise though. 'Please Please Me' is an early classic. Interstingly though, a lot of the Beatles' most successful songs from this period were issued soley as singles. Nevertheless, there is a lot of quality material here.<br />As a Beatles album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot; would prove to be the least accomplied thing they put their name on with the sole exception of &quot;Yellow Submarine.&quot; All things considered, it was still a great place to start and it still is for the listener.
B000002UAC|3.0|&quot;With the Beatles&quot; picks up where its' predecessor left off. There is the same balance of covers and originals here, and the formula works just as well. <br />The Lennon-McCartney numbers have improved on their previous efforts, something they would constantly manage to pull off for quite a few years. 'All My Loving' is simply an early gem. In addition, there are other early classics such as 'It Won't Be Long' and 'Don't Bother Me.' My personal favorite though is the relatively unknown 'All I've Got To Do.'<br />The covers are again well polished, and some argue that 'Roll Over Beethoven' and 'Money' actually better the originals. This is debatable, but they are excellent renditions.<br />The Beatles' songwriting was picking up some serious steam though, and pretty soon they would cast aside the covers that filled their early efforts.
B000002UAF|4.0|This was the first Beatles album to consist solely of original songs, and it is their best album from the early years. The material was written under enormous time constraints. Lennon and McCartney were given the task of writing half an album worth of material in under two weeks...while they were touring in France.<br />The result was magic. They wrote enough songs to fill an entire album, all of which were used for this, the UK version. The first half is the &quot;soundtrack side.&quot; This includes some of the best early songs the Beatles wrote: 'If I Fell,' 'And I Love Her' and the title track to name a few.<br />The &quot;non-soundtrack side&quot; is equally compelling. 'I'll Be Back' is one of my favorite early songs by the Beatles. The bottom line is that there is not a bad song on the album. While we consider this as a necessary criterion for a great album in 2001, back in 1964 must albums simply contained a few hits and filler. The Beatles changed this formula with &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; as they would change so many throughout their career.
B000002UB6|3.0|This album, salvaged from the failed &quot;Get Back Sessions&quot; is flawed to say the least. The album went through three producers and it shows. The natural beauty of McCartney's songs are drowned out by unnecessary string arrangements. This is clearest in the case of 'The Long and Winding Road;' listen to the Anthology version for comparison. Additionally, some of the songs included here are simply not up to snuff with other Beatles' material. 'Dig a Pony' and 'Maggie Mae' aren't bad songs; they are just nothing special.<br />However, despite all the flaws, this is still a decent album. There is the usual prescence of gems here, particuarly by McCartney: 'Let it Be' and 'Get Back' are quality songs. Lennon's 'Across the Universe' dates back to the White Album, but unlike his rejected songs from that period that made it onto &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; this one doesn't work here. Again listen to the Anthology version for comparison.<br />In my opinion, the shining moment of the album is 'Two of Us.' This is the last song that Lennon and McCartney ever shared lead vocal duties on together. However, this song, like almost ever other one on the album, is simply better on the Anthology. Why? This album is overproduced, and the Anthology better manifests the natural beauty of the material.
B000002UB3|5.0|After the disastrous &quot;Get Back Sessions,&quot; the Beatles returned to the studio for one more album. Although the four men were at great odds with each other, they nevertheless managed to orchestrate one last gem to their canon.<br />Great tunes filled out the first side of the album. 'Something' and 'Here Comes the Sun' showed that George Harrison was not only blossoming into a first-rate songwriter, but actually the most commercially effective songwriter at this point in their careers. This would become even clearer when George would release his triple album &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot;<br />What elevated this album into another groundbreaking effort by the band, however, is the medley on the second side. Clearly Lennon was discontented with the slick production of the album, a fact that would become clearer as well by the sparse intrumentation on his own debut. Be that as it may, the Beatles created yet another original idea by pasting together songs for this medley, some of which were rejected from the &quot;White Album&quot; sessions. Lennon's 'Mean Mr. Mustard' and 'Polythene Pam' thus breathed new life.<br />My only personal disappointment with this album is that the Beatles didn't finish it with 'The End.' 'Her Majesty' is anti-climatic and belongs where it was originally sequenced, in the middle of the album before the medley. This is small criticism though, for &quot;Abbey Road&quot; is a remarkable achievement for even the Beatles.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I was fortunate enough to see John Mayer in front of a small crowd in Memphis, TN (a city that supposedly prides itself on knowing what good music is), and I must say the guy is a class act who is definitely on his way up.<br />The hooks are all over this album. The album slows a bit in the end, but they are great if you like slower, sexier stuff. Personally, I like the more upbeat songs toward the front. Songs like &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland,&quot; &quot;Why Georgia,&quot; and &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; are bound to leave you addicted. As a guitar player, Mayer is surprisingly good, able to play very well technically as well as emotionally -- a rarity, for sure. His voice is great, too... sounds a little bit Dave Matthews, but plenty of originality as well.<br />The lyrics are the icing on the cake. They are intelligent, funny and enlightening. Almost everyone can relate to what this guy is saying. And at the concert, he had a great, warm sense of humor, just seems like an all-around great guy, and I can only anticipate that future albums will be even better. I would definitely recommend this to anyone but the musically brain-dead. If you have David Gray, Rob Schnieder, Travis, or any folk or blues rock in your CD collection, you might want to think about picking this one up.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This comedy/tragedy/musical takes you on an adventure into the underground of true Bohemian spirit  - truth, beauty, and &quot;above all&quot; . . .love.  The industry just doesn't make many muscial films these days and to have one with such emotion and clever entertainment was a joy to watch.  <br />Christian (McGregor) and Satine (Kidman) have great chemistry on screen.  They make one's heart melt with the passion they have for one another.  The fact that both McGregor &amp; Kidman sang their own songs in the movie was impressive.  They make it fun to watch.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who is a romantic with a light-hearted spirit.

B000053V7Q|5.0|This is the &quot;special&quot; version of the early 70s film about Elvis' August 1970 appearance in Las Vegas, including rehearsals.  As other reviewers have noted, the original release was good but had very irritating commentary by a frankly bizarre group of fans.  This version cuts out the inanities entirely, and what we have during the last hour or so is nothing but footage from six different Vegas concerts.  These songs are so well-edited that one almost thinks this is one complete concert (it is still unfortunate that a complete, unedited concert from this period is still not available) as it flows beautifully.  <br />Elvis is in his prime here as a live entertainer.  There is little doubt he was the greatest live performer of the second half of the twentieth century and possibly the best ever.  His performances here were almost as great as the so-called &quot;Burbank sessions&quot; of the 1968 television special (which I consider to be the greatest live performances of all time).  He looked fantastic here, full of energy, full of humor, and dripping with charm and charisma.  Even if you are not a fan you can't help but be pulled into his very special world.<br />There are numerous highlights and no dull moments at all on this film.  The best numbers in this reviewer's opinion are &quot;Patch It Up,&quot; &quot;You've Lost That Loving Feeling,&quot; an electrifying &quot;Polk Salad Annie,&quot; and the great &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; (the best version I have seen to date).  Furthermore, the transfer to DVD is outstanding.<br />Don't miss this one.
B00005LOUS|5.0|Jim Carrey's version of The Grinch is more than wonderful! The  characters not only come to life, but quickly become endearing. The village of 'whoville' is a visual feast for the eyes that will long linger in your imagination. A winter paradise was created in this movie. Jim Carrey's antics are comical and he manages to live up to the cartoon depiction. I have purchased this movie because I know I will want to view it again and again.
B00000255F|5.0|If you are interested in The Boss but do not own any of his recordings, please start here. &quot;Born to Run&quot; carries with it the romantic exuberance of the first two albums and foreshadows the stark realism of his next masterpiece, &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot; (please disregard the &quot;Bruce's All-time Best&quot; review that claims Spingsteen 'stopped growing' with BTR, that review gets the facts, and the point, completely wrong!!). Together, the two albums demonstrate a hope/despair duality that is prevalent throughout Bruce's work.<br />So much ink has been spilled on this album that it seems redundant to go on but suffice it to say that every song is great. &quot;Jungleland&quot; can feel a little overripe--but hey, that song is all about the sax solo! &quot;Night&quot; and &quot;She's the One&quot; are a couple of gems that you probably never heard and &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; speaks for itself. Ah, to be discovering it again for the first time...I envy you Bruce novice, ENJOY!!
0345448898|5.0|These books are absolutely astounding. Pullman is truely a talented writer. His characters are developed so throughly and his themes have such depth that I think these should be classified as adult novels. There are many mature themes, not inapropriate at all, but deep and mature concepts, including religous conflicts and quantum physics. I would reccomend these books to older children, teens, and adults. I will note, .... I highly reccomend these books to anyone who has an open mind. Also, although I love them, I think these are even better than Harry Potter, and they'll tide you over till number five!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this for one song (Thank You) and ended up really enjoying the whole album.  Very fluid style (with few exceptions on the album).  Very enjoyable, great lyrics...
B00005JCAA|1.0|Nonsense plot, only manipulative effects used here. Thomas Newmans musik normally elevates the film experience, here is is implemented in a manipulative manner, and seemingly endlessly (although somewhere I think I heard Arvo Prt's Fratres, often wonder why I never encountered that piece in a movie before). Claire Forlani's is constantly filmed with reflections in her eyes, how romaantic. Death falls in love! Blaaaahhh
B00003CX9E|3.0|The AFI has ranked &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; as the #1 film of all time.  Enough said.  I agree.  A critique of the DVD itself might be in order, especially since the word &quot;Dolby&quot; is attached to its processing.  Having not purchased the DVD personally in a store, I trusted that &quot;Dolby&quot; would ensure the highest standards of production, and I believe that to be true.  Unexpected is that those working for the Turner group would process the audio in MONAURAL, just as it was when the film premiered.  Yes, indeed, the sound emanates only from the center channel.  In disbelief, I read the box, which confirmed a monaural film but stereo commentaries and Disc 2 documentary portions.  Restoration without enhancement seems wasted.  Even the VHS issue of 1951's sci-fi classic, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, was in HI FI/STEREO, which made the purchase that much more worthwhile.  Assuming purists might be offended at the thought of a 5.1 &quot;Kane&quot;, an audio setup feature allowing the viewer to choose an audio format (much like the video on many DVDs) would have been a plus.  With all the bells &amp; whistles a DVD can afford, I found it truly disappointing that audio options were ignored.  Incidentally, the music scores for both &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; were by Bernard Hermann-lucky audio mastering for &quot;Earth&quot;, not so for &quot;Kane.&quot;
6305662371|3.0|Everyone touts this movie as being the &quot;Scariest Movie of All Time.&quot;  While I agree that there are some truly shocking and scary moments in the film, it simply isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen.  To me, the film was more of an essay on faith, a drama that discussed powerful, controversial religious issues.  Father Karris's journey from doubt to sacrifice in the film is breathtaking--but not frightening.  Was I the only one that felt the dramatic impact of the film?  The green puke was gross, the head-turning scene was revolutionary, and the crucifix, &quot;Let Jesus...&quot; scene was downright terrifying.  But for me, the true beauty of the film is Father Karris and the victory of good over evil.  You want to truly be terrified?  Go watch &quot;Glitter.&quot;
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Some reviews compare these guys to people like linkin Park, except there is one big difference, LINKIN PARK [BITES] AND AT THE DRIVE-IN RULES!!!Cedric does not rap at all, so if you are looking for some nu-metal rap band this is not for you. At The Drive-In is passionate, energetic, punk rock; not rap metal. So, keep that in mind because if you want rap-metal go buy some Limp Bizkit, nu-metal, garbage.
B00004Z459|4.0|This Album Has Gone Platinum Numerous Times In Different Countries And It's Easy To See Why.The First Single Off This Album &quot;One Step Closer&quot; Is A Definate Masterpiece,Maybe It's A Bit Early For A Band Like Linkin Park To Rise To Stardom Just Yet,But It's A Decent Album And Worth Buying So Theres No Reason To Tell You Not To.Parents For One If They Saw Their Son Or Daughter Getting Into Rock Would Buy This Album Before Any Other As Linkin Park Tone It Down So Much No Explicit Language Appears On The Album.The Standout Tracks For Me Are &quot;Papercut&quot;,&quot;A Place For My Head&quot; &amp; &quot;With You&quot;.
B0000029GA|5.0|I love this album! I just bought it again (for the third time) because as soon as someone finds out that I own it...&quot;I'm Jacked&quot; for it. Disregard all his other albums. This is Nas when he was Nasty Nas. This is classic material. My Favorites: &quot;The World is yours&quot;, &quot;One Love&quot;, &quot;It Ain't hard to Tell&quot;, and &quot;Half Time&quot;
B00001IVOR|3.0|The best word to describe this album is confusing.<br />There are times you get hyped from this and want to just think this album is the greatest album of all time, but then you hear some verses and hooks and think this is just weak. If you feel this album is nothing but garbage, or if you think this album is classic of classics, then you need to re-listen to this and evaluate your decision. <br />We all know this album is nothing like the 36 Chambers. Nothing even close. This album is more of an attempt for mainstream Wu material. This album is much better than &quot;The W&quot; lp. We aren't even going to go there. <br />About the album. Its nice at times, but then again weak. Every artist has impressive verses. Not on every track but for the most part from a lyrical stand-point you can tell it took some time to make this album. It took the Wu Tang about 2 days to make &quot;The W.&quot; <br />Rza could have made the production better on some tracks. But then again give him credit for making a couple of classic ones too. The Rza lost his touch production wise after this album dropped. <br />The subject matter on this album is hip-hop related. There isn't that much garbage about cash, hos, and cars, and all that bs. For the most part its good hip-hop material. Some verses could have been better. The best artist on this album on both sides are the Gza, Deck, and the Donna makes some of the tracks shine.<br />The &quot;Triumph&quot; track is without a doubt classic, hands down. &quot;Reunited&quot; classic. &quot;For Heavens Sake&quot; classic. &quot;Older Gods&quot; Gza makes classic. &quot;Its Yours&quot; classic. <br />Most of the tracks on side two aren't that nice. &quot;Triumph&quot; and &quot;Bells of War&quot; are about the only two classic from that side. <br />In the end we all have different opinions. I was about to give this album 4 stars, but this really isn't worth that many when it comes down to it. In many perspectives this album was created for the mainstream hip-hopers, and not the real heads. I have to take away for that. This album is worth buying, but this isn't an album that needs to be in every music collection, maybe a hip-hop collection, but not all music in general, like the 36 Chambers needs to be. Or like Liquid Swords. Get the album and find out for yourself.
1587990717|1.0|Fooled by Randomness actually fools the customer into thinking that the book is about randomness.  The prologue contains the meat of the book.  The rest is fluff.  The author has some good ideas but he never delivers any substance to the reader.  If you are looking for a technical book on randomness and the role of chance in the markets and in life, this isn't it.
B00000IONU|5.0|This album is brilliant, and i love the vocal voice, i dont know how the person earlier said the voice was terrible, then went onto recommend another white stripes album (which have exactly the same vocal voice!)
0061020710|5.0|I love this book, even though I picked it up for the wrong reason, viz. that I love fantasy and I wanted a diversion from rereading Tolkien for the 89th time.<BR>The real reason you should read this book is that it is wonderfully funny. This is not fantasy in the vein of Tolkien or le Guin. It is completely tongue-in-cheek and in fact this is a comic series that just happens to be set in a fantasy world, just as Wodehouse's Jeeves books were set in rural England.<BR>If you expect maps and exotic languages and chronologies and so on, you will not get them. However if you like a book with whimsical characters, insane plot twists and the odd shameless pun, you will be richly rewarded.<BR>I have decided to work my way through every book in the series, have read the first 5, and can vouch for consistent quality.
6305342776|2.0|I am really bugged by how hard &quot;The Black Hole&quot; (and most sci-fi) apparently TRIES to be an earnest hard scifi movie and utterly disheartened by it's failure to do so.  Ok, robots with ESP I can swallow; it's even kinda cool.<br />Though I found the atmospheric style and special effects appealing, I had to give a negative counterpoint to all the glowing reviews I see here.  And please don't say &quot;it's just a movie&quot; - there's no excuse for grossly poorly thought out stories; suspension of disbelief can't work when premises are patently stupid.  Reasons to laugh at this movie:<br />- What are chemical rocket based ships more suited to flying to the moon doing searching deep space?  It would literally take them 1000's of years to get to even the nearest star. (they should've used some sort of warp/hyperdrive premise)<br />- OK what's with the heaven/hell stuff?  Did the ending make any sense to anyone?  Were the script writers on acid the whole time?<br />- Why was the scientist suddenly INSIDE Maximillian at the end?<br />- Why was Maximillian triumphantly standing over some kind of hellish domain at the end?<br />- What's with robots with tempers and egos... OK so maybe artificial intelligence is really really advanced in the future... but would a robot really have such a bad tantrum that it would blow it's own circuits and die (the STAR sharp shooter)?<br />- Why would robots need to practice target shooting?  Once they perfect their skills, they shouldn't degrade any more than our 20th century car-building robots would.<br />- Why was everyone so impressed with the Cygnus' &quot;gravity&quot; system?  Humans on Earth had obviously already conquered gravity theory since the little robots had &quot;anti-gravity&quot; floating abilities.<br />- Why was there a scene that implied that Maximillian was the real boss on the ship; they never expanded on that hint.<br />- Why was Maximillian ever given chopping blades?  What purpose would that have servedon a ship full of soulless, mindless automatons that never disobey.  And even if some kind of weapon was needed, why not simply give him laser-cannon hands?  The guard robots don't have chopping blades, they all have guns.<br />- Why didn't Maximillian have real hands?  The guard robots did.  It would seem a more useful design.<br />- How could BOB &quot;permanently charge&quot; the other little robot's lasers?  If &quot;permanant charge&quot; technology exists, why isn't he already permanently charged straight out of the factory where he was built?<br />- For advanced deep space ships, don't they even have simple RADAR to detect things, like, oh, say KILLER METEOR SHOWERS before they hit?<br />- Why were the hallways and rooms so cavernous on the Cygnus?  None of the space seemed to serve a purpose. On a real future Earth, the Cygnus designers would be fired for budget overruns.  It would be a waste of space and would never be designed thus.  The Palomino was a realistic ship design; the Cygnus was laughable, though beautifully rendered cinematically.
B00005A46T|2.0|I loved thier first album, but they are flat out lying when said it would destroy that effort.  Not even close.  One thing I can't stand about them is how they never give Slayer any credit for ripping them off.  This isn't cutting edge music folks!!  This was cool in the mid 80's.  Slipknot just turns it upside down and makes it look new.  You can't make death metal mainstream, not saying that this is death metal.  Releasing &quot;Left Behind&quot; further show a bad attempt at getting more $.  But then again it's RR, who need to be put out of buisness for their recent decisions.  This band is a gimmick.  It doesn't take 9 people to do what they do, they just aren't competent to do so.  And the lyrics sound like nursery rymes.  &quot;If your 555 than I'm 666&quot; what is that?  If you want real death metal get something from Dilinger Escape Plan or Nothingface.  I hope that this is the album that launches Slipknot back to iowa where they came from, because I'm tired of hearing about them.
0812550706|5.0|I have to say that after 15 years of reading fantasy/sci fi, Ender's Game and its parallel novel Ender's Shadow are my two favorite books in the world. The buggers are a formidble opponent for humans because of their intelligence and similarity to the people of earth. Ender is a cute little kid...who becomes the mankind's last hope of salvation. Need I say more? I have read this book probably a dozen times, and I always cry at the end when they tell him...never mind, I won't give it away for those of you who haven't read it. All I'll say is, if you have even the slightest interest in science fiction or stories about remarkable children, Ender's Game is an absolute must read. Furthermore, if you read Game and enjoyed it, pick up the parallel novel, Ender's Shadow. Same stoy, Bean's perspective (this will make sense when/if you read Ender's Game). Thoroughly wonderful, you will enjoy every page.
B00005RHGK|3.0|I suppose that a lot of people going to the movies today have grown up on such tripe as Scary Movie, the Friday the 13th series and other crappy horror films.  I suppose these same people expect that every little detail of a film must be explained on an adolescent's level, so as not to confuse them while they watch the films with their eyes as their mouths cannot keep from running while in the theatre.  It's a funny thing - sound when added to a film allowed for certain nuances of the theatre to be present, so that the visual didn't have to do all the work.  So to those who would call this film bad, I say:  turn off your cell phone, stop talking to your buddies, and pay attention to the movie.<br />Jeepers Creepers isn't the finest horror film ever made, but it certainly is one that can scare the bejesus out of you.  Certainly there are very standard plot devices in action here - but isn't that part of the formula for a horror film?  ... <br />Jeepers starts off using bits and pieces of known scare tactics and then milks them with a wink and a nudge.  Should the lead characters go back and see whats up at that creepy looking house where the even creepier looking guy was ....?  Of course not!  The characters even acknowledge this fact.  However, pulled by the same force that requires everyone passing an accident to rubberneck, they do.  (And let's face it - if they didn't - the movie wouldn't have been made).<BR>At once scary, silly, laughable, and immensely frustrating, Jeepers Creepers shows us a new (albeit traditional and truly old hat) villain: a monster! .<BR>Just what this monster wants is never fully explained as the film truly frustrates us by setting itself up for an obvious sequel (which I truly hope gets made).<BR>The film features fine actors performing honestly and well.  Eileen Brennan appears in an extended cameo that is quite unforgettable.  The script is good, the cinematography is quite well done.<BR>When you get up from a horror film, you are hopefully intelligent enough to know that the action on the screen is not possible in the real world.  You have just been treated to little fright akin to a ride on a good roller coaster.  If the movie made you jump, squirm, turn from the screen, or possibly yelp, then its done its job.<BR>Jeepers Creepers does far more than that.  This is a good film that delivers on the scares and leaves you wanting more.<BR>Check it out!
B00005OMTT|5.0|Since I first heard the song Sadeness, I have been a fan of Enigma.  I highly anticipated the release of this CD and it is everything I was hoping for and more.  Although my favorite Enigma song (Silent Warrior) was not included, I would not have one song removed to replace it.  I cannot choose a favorite track since each song is my favorite when it is playing.  Even if you own all the Enigma CD's, listen to this disc as the new sequencing of the songs is excellent--they flow smoothly from one to the next, and it puts them in a new context. Turn off the light, take a deep breath and relax......and enjoy!
0792839234|4.0|People have said to me that they can't make heads nor tails out of this odd flick, which a mixture of horror, comedy, and science fiction.  The plot is simple enough:  a kid enlists his friends to help him gather evidence on the town's local undertaker, who is the prime suspect in several mysterious murders and disappearances.  The movie employs a lot of weird camera tricks and special effects, some done quite effectively on the low budget the producers had to work with.  However, there are many eerie sequences that have left audiences confused as to what exactly was going on:  is the kid dreaming this stuff or not?  Don't take it too seriously!  Enjoy this quirky gem.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Enriques new album &quot;Escape&quot; is fantastic it is unlike all the others to which I have the pleasure in saying I have them all. Escape the single is very upbeat and gets you moving and also &quot;Don't turn of the lights&quot; is superb, there is also a track called &quot; Love to see you Cry&quot; to which I would say is the best track on the album. It starts with the sounds of the Spanish guitar and then explodes into a fast moving dance track quite superb. There are also some wonderful ballards on the album &quot;Hero&quot; which is not being released here in the uk and &quot;Maybe&quot; to which I find personally too slow but overall a lovely ballard with good lyrics.This is a superb album and well worth the wait. All we need now in the UK is some airplay and this is will be the making of Enrique here.
B000056WTC|5.0|There have been many martial artists who appeared in movies after Bruce Lee, but none, not even Jackie Chan, have ever been able to claim his throne.  This is the movie that made Lee a star in American, but sadly, Mr. Lee didn't live to see how much of an impact he made in this film.  The fight scenes are amazing--Lee was the only fighter onscreen who could whip tail and made it look pretty while he was doing it!
B00005O5JV|5.0|I totally loved this movie--it was funny and sweet and a very happy ending! If you loved Reese Witherspoon before, you will love her even more while watching it.
0790740656|5.0|Great satire that plays on teens worries about being successful later in life and the business world in general.  Cruise had appeared in smaller roles in other movies, but this was the one that made him stand out.  DeMornay has an interesting take on the hooker with a (somewhat) heart of gold, Joe Pantalino plays a great bad guy, while Curtis Armstrong and Brochot Pinchot bring up the rear as Cruise's buddies.  A must-have film.
B0000507R0|5.0|Brain Salad Surgery redone in DVD Audio format is a real listening pleasure.  Bonus track of Lucky Man is a real plus.  The organ jumps from speaker to speaker in the 5.1 format.  But it was not overdone.  What can I say this is a classic album just made better by re-mixing to DVD.
B00004U2HK|1.0|Is it possible to contract diabetes from watching a movie?  The Sound of Music comes pretty darn close!  Overly sentimental pablum with unremarkable songs.  Too cutesy, too long, too boring.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|After the disapointing Blaze Bailey era Iron Maiden has released an exceptional new album with the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith. The songs all demonstrate that even after twenty-plus years the (old) boys are still capable of breaking new ground.  Every track blends new, smooth, rich and resonant production with the bands patented intensity that defined British Metal throuhgout the 1980's. The guitar work remains nice and heavy with the addition of sophisticated texture and tone.  Steve Harris has expanded his range as well, showing a definite increase in subtle dynamics without losing intensity.  Nicko is, as always, the consumate skin-master. His drumwork provides a driving groove that most Metal bands can only dream of. It's truly amazing to hear how tight his rhythm keeping is without ever sounding mechanical. The most notable innovations, however, come in the vocal arena.  Clearly, Bruce Dickinson's solo career has given him the confidence to break some serious new ground. His choices of melody, harmony and phrasing, along with greatly expanded soft/hard dynamics, are fantastic. As I mentioned, all the tracks are worthy of praise with &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; and &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; among my favorites. The only critique I can offer is that Mr. Harris could have spent a bit more time refining the lyrics for &quot;Nomad&quot;.  Otherwise, a long awaited and very appreciated CD!
0790749998|5.0|This movie was really good, and that suprised me.  I thought it was going to be the usual beat them up kind of movie but it actually had a complex plot that wasn't as easy to predict as I was expecting.  I really like the old Jet Li films (except any of the once upon a time in china(s)).  I wasn't sure if I would like a film like this one but it was really good.  Plenty of action but it was done so Diffrently that it was like watching something really new.  This is even a movie for compromise if one person wants to watch action and the other a slight romance.  It has both.
0345409671|1.0|Lumbering, turgid, incredibly boring.  If she sat down to write a suffocatingly dull book on purpose, she could not have done a better job.  I am not a religious person, but I found the theology bizarre.  And there is page, after page, after page of it.  Pure torture.
630575067X|1.0|I was REALLY looking forward to this movie when it came out.  I am a big Star Wars fan (watched the movies hundreds of times, read the books, etc.) and had been watching the reports for another movie comming on its way.  I rushed to see it and after the movie was over I sat there wondering &quot;What the heck was that?&quot;  It was terrible.  The whole story was ment to run on effects instead of a story line.  Though it did follow the story I feel as though much of it was thrown together just around the computers and what they can do.  The guy with the long ears (sorry don't know his name) was compleatly anoying and though he was there to be funny he was FAR from funny.  Why does he need to be there?  In the original Star Wars, there were no chars. added just for comic relief.  They were funny on their own.  I am not even sure if I will waste my time on the next one.  It will probably be a waste of my time and 6 buck.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Don't get me wrong---Radiohead's music isn't that bad, in fact i enjoy pyramid song, but let's face it---the lead singer sounds like a sick, dying cow. i mean, my god! this is depressing. i dunno. maybe i just don't like to sit around and listen to music that makes me want to sulk in the rain and cry myself to sleep. i just would like some variety. in fact, radiohead has destroyed rock and roll. let me put it this way: it's morphine music. it numbs your senses and takes you on a trip into the boohoo section of your brain. if u want a good psychedelic trip, try some Tool or Pink Floyd, not sick, dying cattle.
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes is an all around emotional autobiography. The author, Frank McCourt, gives the reader a deep inside view of what his childhood was. He describes life in Ireland during the depression.<BR> Almost immediately after the book begins, feelings of grief, sadness, and lament start to flow through the reader's mind. As Frank McCourt describes the hardship and struggles he experienced, suck as extreme poverty, a drunken, careless father, deaths of young siblings, and lack of food, the reader is led to a dead end of feelings of depression. Nevertheless, reading this beautifully written story of a poverty stricken Irish family in the midst of the depression, the reader understands and realizes truths that may be taken for granted in life.<BR> Despite the depressing subject matter of the story, it's quite uplifting, as in the end, Frankie fulfills his goal and earns enough money to move back to America, where he was born. He has to begin working at a very young age to support his family after his father deserts them, when he at last reaches the age of 19, he finally puts enough money aside for himself and is able to return to America.<BR> I would highly recommend this book to others. I feel that it allows one to feel better about life even though it may be full of suffering. It shows how important family is and how we humans should care about others.
B000000993|5.0|Wow!!! Undoubtedly their finest album! I thought i knew everything about tool when i had aenima, lateralus, and salival, but i was wrong. this is one of the greatest albums i own. i listen to it constantly. the texture and that sharp, clawing sound are enough by themselves to grip you and pull you in, no pun intended (undertow, haha, get it?), but mjk's voice has extraordinary sound in it on this album that is hard to explain and is strangely absent from other tool releases. i think it's the range of his voice. it goes low like on opiate, but he hits the high notes perfectly and makes the music part of his voice. the cd also has not only vocal range, but lyrical range, with songs such as &quot;prison sex&quot; (child abuse), &quot;sober&quot; (an alcoholic artist), and &quot;undertow&quot; (drug addiction). adam jones' dark and pushy guitar riffs rip through your mind, finding the center in you and then chewing it up. danny carey's primal drumming keeps your brain pulsing to the power that is tool. paul d'amour's pounding bass riffs pump into you, like some electrical current.<BR>tool is amazing and is one of a kind. undertow is a masterpiece. i strongly reccomend it.
B000021Y77|2.0|The meat of the movie is given away by the title.  Be prepared to watch Lola do an awful lot of running...and then some more. American movie critics seem to have a fetish for any movie foreign.  Don't believe the hype...the plot is not ingenious nor are the direction and production groundbreaking. The basic idea (Lola has to come up with 100,000 bucks and get it to her distressed boyfriend Manni in 20 minutes or he will be killed) would have made for an exciting short film, but instead is stretched into an agonizing almost feature length film.  The same story plays out three times, with three different endings.  The premise is interesting (not original): how little, insignificant events drastically change the outcome of people's lives.  But the film spends too little time exploring the idea and WAY too much time showing Lola running. There is NO character development.  We don't care if Manni or Lola or anyone else dies or lives. The viewer has no vested emotional interest in the characters (unless you're sympathetic towards whining punk drug dealers who forget their drug money on subways). Cartoon animation, interesting polaroid segments, and a relentless techno soundtrack are added in a desperate attempt to keep the viewer interested in watching Lola run all over town. <BR>I don't get how Lola changes many lives in this film.  There are only a few polaroid sequences that are directly affected by her presence. <BR>Lola gets one star for being in excellent cardiovascular shape, and another star for some interesting pillow talk sequences that give the movie its only interesting substance. Its worth a rent just to see what people have been talking about (Of course we have forgotten Lola and now love Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon...Although that is a way better film.)
B00003CXAA|5.0|First of all, let me state that parts I and II are among the best american films of all time, and as flawed as part III might have been I do not agree with a lot of reviewers that say that it should not be included. I mean this is the Godfather 'collection' and as a person of sound mind one can not expect Coppola to spend another X million dollars so he can release the set with just the two movies. But enough about that, and I will go into the product itself. First of all, congratulations, the picture and sound are excellent on all 3 films, now we can truly savor Nino Rota's music and Gordon Willis' cinematography without all that artificial lighting in the TV and other versions. Great job all in all, now with the shortcomings. First of all, the extended documentary in the extra features DVD was edited by Zeotrope a company owned by Coppola and as interesting as the documentary is it neatly evades important topics. Before I go into those topics, about the documentary itself: it is interesting, but it could have been gripping, it drags in parts and is it just me or does it take too long to make its point about Coppola's insistance on Pacino playing Michael, it takes its time with Coppola explaining his casting decissions in part I but what about the other two? I'd of loved to know how he got Lee Strasberg.<BR>Now with the topics that should have not been evaded:<BR>a) I've always wanted to know this, why o why did Coppola cast his daughter to play Michael's daughter in part III. Did you know that that role was to go to Winona Ryder but after she got sick it went to Sofia? You didnt? well that was for Coppola to explain, and what did he think of later criticism on that point? <BR>b) I would have liked to see the actors responses to each Oscar ceremony, the 3-supporting-nominees of 1972 I think is very interesting. <BR>c) Where's Brando????? I can understand if you could simply NOT interview him, but put together everything you have of his and let us see him, I find him the best actor of his generation and extremely interesting. I'd give anything to know why he decided to return his Oscar that way or what he thought of Deniro's interpretarion of the young Don. And on a not so smaller note, in that case, where's De Niro?, he shows up but one cant get enough of him. <BR>d) I would have liked to know many of the 'little things' like why Clemenza 'dissapears' in the second part and why Tom Hagen similarly vanishes in the third, why Cuba in part II and the Vatican in part III, and so on. It wouldnt have taken too much time. And I was also very intrigued by other small plot details, like what's with that twist involving Pantangelli's brother? <BR>e) I know this might seem childish but I would like to hear from everyone involved which film they liked best and why, also what they thought about working with the other actors and their performances. <BR>f) Also, the 'extra scenes' we get are all part of the 'Godfather Saga' which was edited by Coppola in chronological order both Part I and II. Save one extra scene (the one from part III) all the others were not that new. For example did you know they shot a sequence where Michael shoots down Fabrizio with his own shotgun after returning from Italy in the FIRST film? This was shot but never made the final print, it would have been extremely interesting to check these scenes out.<BR>And many more... but on with other things, I would like to have seen at least 2 trailers on each film and some kind of interviews or something with people 'outside the family' like critics and such, I would have loved to know what Scorsese thought of them and even better... I got carried away, sorry. The deleted scenes are phenomenal, EXCELLENT, only, what's with the deleted scenes from part III, there seems to be only one... My mind went blank all of a sudden but still, this is a great Collection well worth buying if you really like these movies, buy it if youre a real fan and not a scheptic. A 9/10 as a DVD collection with all the features, as for the movies, part I 10/10, part II 10/10, part III 9/10. EXCELLENT films, a real WOW, own them today.
6305165912|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again.  So many classic scenes.  What makes this movie even funnier is that probably every character in it is based on an actual person living right now in California.  Don't worry about the significance of the plot...just sit back and watch the pure comedic genius as Jeff Bridges and Co. explore the possiblilites of what can happen when perfectly innocent morons start to make plans.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is Star Wars, full of action, droids and with a minimum of thought--except wehen Anakin says goodbye to his mother.  I can't wait for the next one.  The hesitation of he Jedi Council about Anakin is superb, and the blundering bad guys are perfect,  and the pure evil of Darth Moll (trivia--he has 11 horns) reminds one of Iago. There are a thousand small things, some of which are documented in the how I made it disc, but this is a buy it, not a rent it, DVD.  Just the sound is worth it, like the Matrix.
078322687X|5.0|All I have to say is that this movie is fun.  Not only is it fun, it gives you insight into the minds of Teenagers.  Funny thing is these kids are timeless.  I recommend to any 13-17 year old that wasn't around for it the first time around.
6300182150|2.0|National Lampoons Animal House, 1978<br />Running Time: 109 minutes <BR>Director: John Landis<BR>Actors/ Actresses: John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Kevin Bacon<br />Nation Lampoons Animal House is a screwball comedy which shows that what can go wrong will.  Animal House offers a gross distortion of college life set in a 1960's background.   From one disastrous event to the next viewers are pulled through the highs and lows, happenings and miss-happenings of the members of the Delta House fraternity at Faber College.<BR>  With the Omega Fraternity out to get them and Dean Wormer placing them on DOUBLE SECRET PROBATION what else is there to do, but throw a toga party.  With failing grades, lude public acts, and more alcohol than they know what to do with the fraternity brothers face a court hearing and a potential revoking of their charter.  <BR>After the hearing when their charter has been revoked and their fraternity house has been emptied the Delta house members needs some encouragement.  Who better to offer some cheer and a rousing speech than John Belushi.  With his idiotic and disgusting ways Belushi \\"Bluto\\" leads the fraternity into the ultimate revenge, the complete and total annihilation of the Faber Homecoming parade.  <BR>I give this comedy two stars.  One because there were scenes in the movie which made me laugh, because they were so ridiculous and one because it was an excellent exaggeration of college life in the 60's.  I simply can't rate this movie with any more stars because I a firm believer that movies should have a little more plot, focus, and purpose than this movie.
1878574590|4.0|Frank Miller sure knows how to both write and draw an awesome book.  In a town practically owned by prostitutes Marv, a real nasty customer, is framed for the murder of a prostitute and he decides to find out who did it.  As Marv unravels the mystery he must face a seemingly emotionless serial killer, Various thugs and some prostitutes whose leader looks awfully familiar.  Is there anyway Marv can survive this city.  The answer might shock you.<BR>Frank Miller refuses to pull punches with his first tale of the the city that sin built and by my opinion it's my favourite.  The characters are likable SOBs, or in the villains' case unlikable SOBs.  The use of shadows and light is very effective and engaing, while giving the comic a very special feel that would be ruined by using a rainbow of colors.  Hell, I wonder is Basin City ever gets rainbows.  Though it doesn't have the feel of an epic poem that &quot;the Dark Knight Returns had, it is definately a very solid and exciting tale of revenge.
B00004Z459|5.0|Ok, I don't write reviews often, but when a band as good as this comes around I just gotta back them.  The blend of rap lyrics with vocals by the lead singer give Linkin Park a different sound from so many other bands that blend the rock/rap genres.  I found Linkin Park to be rather refreshing.  The content of their songs may not be about socially relevant topics, but with skillful song writing they are emotionally relevant.  One of the greatest aspects of music is that people can relate to it; it touches our hearts and exercises (not exorcises) our souls.  Like master artists, the band has released an emotionally charged album that expresses human existence.  If you're a fan of the rap/rock genre, this album shouldn't disappoint.
B00005NW02|5.0|It's just System Of A Down. And that says more then enough.
6305657947|4.0|Although the presentation is not as stylish as the original, I prefer this version.  There is better chemistry between the characters, Thomas is actively involved in the crime &amp; he steals art, not money.  Being a devoted Magritte fan, I have to love the ending.  :o)  Loved it!
0156012197|5.0|I have just finished this book (not an hard stuff) and I came here to see some reviews, but with my disappoint I wasn't able to find one really interesting or close to my impressions. <BR>Maybe is not useless to say that is not a child book, but one for the child we were. I saw in many newsgroup that this is considered by many peoples one of the most important and formative book ever read, together with books like Hermann Hesse's Demian or Dostoevsky's Idiot. <br />The great of this book is its great emotional impact (tears flowed on my face) that permit to remove your adult shelter, and to taste the simply warm pleasure of beauty and grace. I love this book for the way I felt reading it : I felt first of all human, a living person, without protection, and ready to be exposed to life, in good and in evil, like a child.<br />This book is not amazing for the &quot;insightful&quot; messages we should analyse after read it, I didn't. I don't want to analyse, divide, decompose or try to understand in a rational way (remember from what the word &quot;RATIOnal&quot; come) what that is a message for the heart : try an olistic approach instead. <BR>Enjoy the calm beauty of what is nice and lightning for itself.
0792840461|3.0|Very stylish presentation &amp; great outfits on Faye.  However, there is little chemistry -- Steve's character isn't especially seductive.  Also, he does not physically involve himself with the crime.  See the remake.
0385335482|5.0|This book is really funny. It made me laugh out loud several times. A book for everyone who likes shopping and always running out of money. The second one is as much fun as the first one. Read it and you'll love it!
B00003CXCQ|4.0|The movie is beautiful, but not to a 3 1/2 year old.  My granddaughter was scared too much.
0380002930|5.0|I reread this magnificent book whenever I need an escape from stress - and it is just as exciting every time.  What a masterpiece!  I absolutely love it - from the characters to the descriptions of the landscape to the storyline that sweeps you along like a river.  Thank you to Richard Adams for this wonderful story.
B000002B1M|3.0|&quot;It was written&quot; is a decent effort from Nas, when i first purchased it a few years back, i was expecting a bit more. Being that its' hard to find some decent hip-hop now-a-days i found myself digging it out the crates. I must admit it has some hot tracks, however its no where close to &quot;illmatic&quot;.
0855328355|4.0|I would recommend this book for someone who has never done any ribbon embroidery at all.  If you've done even a couple small projects, this might be too rudimentary for you.  It has detailed photos and directions for 4 main stitches and photos of about 60 different flowers. (this seems like a lot, but it really isn't.) It also touches on stenciling and painting backgrounds, and matting and framing, which is novel. Only a few flowers have step-by-step instructions, but the rest aren't too hard to figure out from the detailed pictures. There are only a handful of project patterns included-- although those are very clear and easy to understand. Experienced sewers looking for something beyond the basics should choose another book.
B00003CWTI|3.0|P.T. Anderson's Magnolia is filled with so many great characters and fantastic bits of dialogue, it's almost tempting to overlook its flaws and hail it a masterpiece.  That's the first time you see it.  Anderson's pretention and melodrama become more and more cloying after repeated viewings.  And that's a shame, because there are several inspired moments and a great Aimee Mann soundtrack in between the overwrought scenes.<br />First of all, the movie is way too long and these characters way too good to be crammed into three hours.  Most of these characters deserve their own movie, at least one less populated (i.e. Boogie Nights).  Instead, Anderson decides to cram all of them into one gigantic mess.  It's very hard to keep up with every single storyline; there's way too much information being thrown out at the audience at once.  Anderson accomplished more artistically with the minimalist plot in &quot;Hard Eight&quot; than he does in this three-hour &quot;magnum opus&quot;.<br />Then there's the film's pretention.  There are scenes, such as the spontaneous sing-a-long, that are supposed to be taken at face value.  Unfortunately, they are played with such straight-faced gradeur that it forces the audience to laugh at them.  It's so cloyingly cheesy that it becomes embarrassing to watch.  As for the preposterous ending, don't ask.  At first it seemed novel, but it becomes simply annoying the second time around.<br />P.T. Anderson is an enormous talent, but he needs to minimalize what he has to say.  By concentrating on less, as he did in Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, he gets to say more.  Hopefully, he has finally gotten the &quot;big message&quot; out of his system so he can return to telling great stories once again.
B000055XMF|4.0|(I give the movie 5 stars, but the &quot;Pop-Up Video&quot;-style captions could have been done so much better I have to drop my score one point.)  I've loved this movie since I first saw it at the Laurelhurst Theater in Portland around '80-'81.  I've been waiting for the DVD and bought it as soon as I saw it was out.  The movie is still great and they've done a fine job restoring it, and, when I saw the caption feature, thought it might be a chance to learn a little about the mod scene and the making of the movie.  It's obvious the VH-1 crew didn't do the captions because they're either spelled wrong, incorrect or just plain stupid.  Did you not know the word &quot;bloody&quot; is an intensifier in English slang (as in, &quot;these captions are bloody lame&quot;).  This definition is given not once but twice during the movie.  Jimmy's rocker friend, Kevin, says &quot;bollocks&quot; and it's translated as &quot;bogus&quot;.  This is Quadrophenia, not Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  OK, I did find a couple of the captions informative and/or amusing.  Definitely get the movie, watch the captions once just to see how bad they are then turn them off for good.
B00004X01U|2.0|After her brief stint in spirituality,  Madonna returns with a vengeance to her familiar white trash roots, a genre  in which she is more familair. The usual melodic-less throw ups abound. She returns what she is most famous for; empty ,meaningless, cringing, mindless lyrics.<BR>I think there was one song that was good on here, and that's saying alot. Stay away from this one folks. And Madge, lose the bucket hat.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|It is different, but that is good. It is uncomparable to the highly praised and wonderful classic Time Out of Mind, but that is ok. It is a range of music taken from classic Big Joe Turner-like swing (Summer Days) to hard-rockin' hits like Honest With Me. Some songs are reminescent of some of his classics. One can hear Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat in Cry A While. I find the entire album worthy of any musical fan's ear. Where did the never ending touring man find the time to write such a classic.
B00005631D|5.0|Very difficult to get. Unique music style. Warm and relaxing.
B00005M989|1.0|Arrrgghhh!!! What is this?? What happened???<br />This CAN'T be the best compilation by Prince, in fact not even close! He should've released a box set instead containing the full versions of the songs (minus the profanity and sexuality, if you don't mind). I used to really like Prince when I was a kid, but I just think he is a good artist, though it would've been a tad better if he wasn't talking about sex too much. At least, the horrid filler Sexy Blah-De-Blah isn't on this album.<br />This album is a complete bust; no long-play album versions, just the same sappy singles copied off the previous compilation. (I don't have it, I just researched it ...)<br />His B-side 17 days could've been a single.<br />If you're new to Prince, start with this album. If you have the previous 3 CD compilation, this will be a disappointment!

B00005QHPQ|3.0|I love Enrique, really I do but this cd let me down.  Who is he trying to be with lyrics such as &quot;she be the one....She be the bomb&quot;?!?!? She be the bomb?  what?  No one says that anymore that is from 2 or 3 years ago.  He is trying to sound black, is that it?  I loved the &quot;Enrique&quot; cd it had so much passion.  This one doesn't have that.  It doesn't have the emotions you can actually feel just by hearing the songs.  I must admit Hero or course is good but some of the other songs on this are just plain dumb.

0790731479|5.0|Well, not exactly but pretty darn good, funny, they should do a special edition, because the special effects are dated, they should do a sequel, has anyone wondered where the heck is Michael Keaton, I suppose that with all the money he did with his Batman movies he doesn't need work anymore, come back Michael, in anything, maybe a look at an old aging Batman thinking of retiring would be good or a sequel to Beetlejuice or something new and good, but no Jack Frost sequels, please.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game is a action packed, fast paced science fiction novel for those who love a great read!  I loved this book for two reasons.  First of all, I couldn't put it down! From the fist paragraph to the last, Orson Scott Card had me hooked! The pace of the book kept me so intrigued wondering what would happen next that I had to keep reading!  I don't think this is the type of novel one could start and then never finish.  I also enjoyed this book because the plot isn't the typical plot of books I've read before. Boy genius, Andrew Wiggin, or \\"Ender\\" as they call him, has been born for the task of saving the world from the alien buggers.  At six years old he enters battle school and begins preparation for the bugger war.  At battle school Ender excels in simulation games of battles and is quickly promoted to higher levels in his training.  However being the best of the best at this school doesn't make it easy on Ender.  He has to learn to overcome his fears and realize that the world depends on him to save the human race from extinction. Certain passages are sure to make your heart race while others could encourage a tear or two.  This is a great book and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves a good book that's hard to put down!

6305169187|1.0|Now, I normally like big, fun action movies. I thought I would like this one. No way. This is a very overbloated film with little to no fun at all. The movie is bogged down by unappealing characters and boring scenes that you really can't hold much interest in the film at all. Bruce Willis is fine and all, but Ben Affleck seems to just be there to look pretty. Why would he do this after coming off &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and winning an Oscar?!. The special effects are, of course, great and very impressive. That's about it. Director Michael Bay tried to go a little more serious and to get more respect with &quot;Pear Harbor&quot;, but he screwed that one up too and it was a huge stinker. This is a bad movie that can only be described in one word: awful!.
0743216458|5.0|For those of us that have never gone to war, it can be difficult to understand what it must feel like. What pressures do soldiers face upon the battle field? What is it like to operate under the pressure of enemy fire? This book asks another question: \\"Can a citizen army be trained and prepared well enough to fight Germans in a protracted campaign in Northwest Europe?\\" Hitler made clear his contempt for a citizen army from the United States, but would his predictions prove correct?<br /><br />Stephen Ambrose's book Band of Brothers has been turned into a series for television and while I am impressed with this production, I feel that the book provides a much deeper understanding of the soldiers experiences. Ambrose writes so clearly and so accurately that you feel you are right there in heat of battle: ready to jump out of those flak battered airplanes, hiding in a fox hole or under fire from enemy shelling. This is a very effectively written book and one all students of the second world war should read, and indeed it should also be read by others who may not fully understand war at all.<br /><br />The expression Band of Brothers really does suit this group of men from Easy Company (506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division) who came together at Camp Toccoa, for training and then came to England to ready themselves for the invasion of mainland Europe. Following D-Day Easy fought in Operation Market Garden and in the Battle of the Bulge at Bastogne - holding out against the might of Hitler's Panzers, while surrounded by the enemy in freezing winter conditions. In the end you will really appreciate what these and countless other men did during World War 2 to help us overcome the evil that had threatened to engulf Europe and the World. These citizen soldiers proved their worth in the heat of combat and overcome the mighty Nazi armies.<br /><br />We owe each of these men a debt of gratitude.
B000059XY3|4.0|Batman Forever is easily the best entry in the series next to the original. It's obvious a lot different in tone compared to Tim Burton's original vision, but director Joel Schumacher takes it and makes it his own. The result is an astonishing gorgeous looking film. The plot centers around Batman/Bruce Wayne taking in a young charge named Dick Grayson, whose family was killed by evil villain Two Face(Tommy Lee Jones). Before you know it, Two Face has teamed up with a nutcase named Edward Nygma(Jim Carrey)who transforms himself into The Riddler, who has concocted a machine that'll take the life out of people. Far fetched?. Yes indeed. Dick Grayson finds out Bruce's true identity and wants to become part of the team. Val Kilmer is a decent Batman. He definitley looks more the part than Michael Keaton. He was a worthy choice. Jim Carrey does what Jim Carrey does best. He's manic and all over the place. The best, however, is Tommy Lee Jones. He really brings his nasty character to full, colorful life. Chris 'O' Donnell and Nicole Kidman are both equally plain and not interesting. Schumacher throws in gadget after gadget and colorful scene after colorful scene. It was a nice change of pace from Burton's gloomy Gotham City. All in all, this is one rip snorting, splashy, comic book adventure that's destined to please fans!. This film is colorful fun. A welcome break from the doom and gloom of the previous two.

B000001ESP|5.0|When I was in middle school, I noticed a buddy of mine was wearing a &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; concert shirt. I asked him who was this band called Rush (This was in the 70's folks). He let me borrow his album and I listened to it. It blew me away. Neal on the drums, Getty on the bass and synthesizer, and Alex on the lead guitar. They were living the &quot;Limelight&quot;. Now in the year 2001, I can honestly tell you, I've owned one album, 3 cassettes, and now one CD of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;. I can honestly say that this is a must and will forever be in my collection.
B00000K19E|5.0|As you watch films like The Matrix you can begin to see many thematic elements hatched from previous stories.  Like many movies The Matrix was put together using other pieces of literature.  Three noticeable story comparisons are present in The Matrix.  Alice in Wonderland is referred to directly in the movie as \\"Neo\\", the character played by Keanu Reeves is led into a new, world that is unknown to him.  The story in The Matrix is actually tied closer to an ancient piece of philosophical literature.  The Allegory of the Cave by Plato is a perfect match with the design for the \\"Matrix.\\"  The basis of The Allegory of the Cave is that man inside the cave believes all that he sees inside the cave is real.  It is only until man discovers that he has been confined that he realizes the truth one step at a time.  The things that he sees are shadows or variations of reality.  Man sees what is making these illusions and then recognizes what the real world is.  In the \\"Matrix\\" the people live out their normal lives thinking everything is real that they see.  In reality the people are barely alive and are lead into a false life by A.I.  Their minds' are programmed to believe that they live a normal life while in actuality they are trapped in a world controlled by machines.  The Matrix seems basically to be a modernized version of this classic piece of philosophical genius.  <BR> In comparison, the fantasy world created by the computers represents the cave.  The cave is more detailed and modernized in this wonderful piece of Sci-Fi art.  When watching the movie the transitions between the \\"Matrix\\" and the real world are so drastic that we, the audience are left in utter and complete amazement of the outcome.   The Wakowski Brothers have ingeniously taken this wonderful philosophical story and rejuvenated it.  Even though The Allegory of the Cave only gives The Matrix a setting and outline with room for growth it still plays a major role in the movie.  <BR> The audience begins tosee evidence of the \\"Matrix's\\" unreality, as the movie uses visual and audible clues that give the knowledge that the world \\"Neo\\" lives in is in fact falsely generated.  As \\"Neo\\" answers his call from \\"Morpheus\\", played by Laurence Fishburne, you can hear a sort of computer static in the ring of the phone.  Then as the wind blows the phone from his grasp on the side of skyscraper, the phone visually slows down and resumes its descent at a regular pace. <BR> This eye candy is used throughout the entire movie.  Things are depicted in slow motion to the viewer to symbolize that they are moving with incredible quickness.  This quickness is only shown by people who are aware of the \\"Matrix\\" and the rules of the \\"Matrix\\".  The \\"Matrix\\" being a computer generated world has its rules, but like most computer programs these rules can be bent or even broken.  All that is needed is the open mind and knowledge that the impossible is possible. <BR> The Matrix uses much philosophy in its structure as a movie.  Many of the ideas in the movies were taken directly from the thoughts of philosophers.  For example, \\"Morpheus\\" explains that when you die in the \\"Matrix\\" you die in the real world.  This is because the \\"Matrix\\" stimulates your mind to make you believe everything is real.  If you die in the \\"Matrix\\" your mind dies, and your body cannot exist without your mind.  This argument was made by the famous philosopher Descartes, who believes that a person is made up of two separate parts; one part body and one part mind.<BR> I highly recommend watching The Matrix as it not only dazzles the mind with its special effects, but it expands ones mind with new enlightened thoughts.  I cannot imagine a better way of showing the work of Plato to the modern world. The acting is amazingly surprising as Keanu Reeves gives his best performance in this milestone of philosophical theater art.
B000058BGZ|5.0|If you're a fan of Schoenberg in general, or the piano concerto in particular, there is no need to hesitate with this wonderful recording. This may be my favorite 20th century piece and it's certainly the version I like best. Previously my top contender (now sadly out of print) was Pollini with Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic. It is another great version worth hearing, my only real complaint there being that you can hear the numerous edits where they cut and pasted the performance together. That problem does not exist here with Boulez and Uchida. The piano concerto is a dense, contrapuntal work and Boulez makes sure that none of the parts get lost. Uchida's playing is superb, concise yet emotional. The Cleveland Orchestra shows no strain even in this works difficult passages. The only thing that strikes me negatively about this Uchida/Boulez version is that the second movement seems a bit fast to me but it works.<br />For those who are not yet fans of Schoenberg, this is a great place to start. I see the piano concerto as the highlight of Schoenberg's 12-tone output, though some would argue for Variations for Orchestra, op. 31. What attracts me to his music is that Schoenberg, more than being the post-Romantic composer evident in his first ten tonal published works, is really a &quot;hyper&quot;-Romantic. Bigger than life, rich orchestrations, sweeping melodies and thick harmony. And though he has the firmest command of music theory, structure, etc., it is the emotional impact of this piece that really shines through for me. By using 12-tone harmony he is able to change moods on a dime and can express horror and delight in ways tonal music cannot.<br />In addition to the concerto you get hear his first atonal piece, a great op. 11, the short but wonderful op. 19, and the two main solo piano works of his well-known students Webern and Berg. The Webern is a masterwork in balance and is fantastic here. I now own two copies of the Berg and it still doesn't strike me,but perhaps in time.<br />This is a great cd.
0345428064|3.0|After reading McNab's &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; and &quot;Immediate Action,&quot; I thought I'd give his fiction a try.  Overall this book is entertaining, with more action than recent vintage Clancy novels.  The action is often quite intense and, in those moments, it is a real page turner.  The technical and tradecraft details are what really make this book.  McNab, or course, is all the more believable in these areas due to his personal experiences as relayed in his non-fiction work.  He buys a credibility there that Clancy, et al. just can't match.  Worth reading for that fact alone.  <br />While the story is good and the details better, the writing itself is sometimes clumsy.  Maybe this is nitpicking, since the reality is that the writing somehow seems to &quot;fit&quot; the story (you wouldn't want Steinbeck or Hemingway telling the story, would you?).  However, I suspect that the writing is simply due to first novel syndrome (I had no complaints about his writing in Bravo Two Zero), and would expect this to improve in future works.<br />Although I only gave the book 3 stars, I'll definitely keep McNab on my &quot;read&quot; list.
B00005QIPH|3.0|About as derivative as you could imgagine, but sort of worth owning. The hype is testament to how bad most other cds in this category are. I'm sure as soon as I see some English twit raving about them at a party, I'll give my copy to my cleaning lady, and she'll give it to her teenage daughter, who I know will listen to it and feel unsure...since it doesn't sound like boy band or Britney. Then it will make it into the hands of her 12 year old brother, and he'll listen to it and conclude that it isn't nearly as good as the Pavement, GBV, Mogwai, and the Who albums he already owns. If it makes him buy White Light White Heat, it was all worth it. If it makes him buy more pocky, it'll be magic.
6301969294|3.0|Finally saw this amazing film..Don't know how I ever missed it..truly one of the oddest films to ever come out of Hollywood...the debt to Kane is not mentioned enough by reviewers here..campy and  perfect time capsule of a certain completely lost American era.

I'm thinking Kevin Spacey and ummm..gee who is the modern day counterpart of Patricia Neal?  Kate Blanchett when she stops slumming around maybe..And why the hell could they MAKE such adult movies 50 years ago?

1878424319|5.0|OK-I received this book last year from someone who cared deeply for me at the time. I read it briefly then but did not capture its true essence. So, here I am over a year later and I decided to give it another read.  What an inspiration it has served me!Maybe now I better understand why it was given to me.  Every one of the 4 Agreements has an inspirtional teaching that is so true and real-sensible but seldom applied.  It provides excellent guidence on how to better live your life.  It is a small book and a quick read but not without touching your soul and allowing you to reach inside and open up to living a better way. I recommend that you keep the book close at hand whenever possible and please read more than once.  Although what it has to say may be read in 30 minutes-it packs in teachings of a lifetime.  I hope that I am not the only one who can benefit from its teachings-but I know it is a start.
B0000399WI|5.0|Shawshank, externally, is nothing spectacular. There've been prison movies in the past; we can expect more in the future.  What makes Shawshank any different is that it puts magic--perhaps the most foreign of elements, considering the setting--into the film.  It doesn't break any new ground, and the story isn't particularly awe inspiring, but where this film represents a model for cinema production is that it shows that Heart is of more importance than glitz; in short, it shows the faults of Hollywood by doing the opposite.<br />It is my favorite movie, because I am Andy Dufresne.  I bet every person who watches it becomes Andy Dufresne.  We all feel imprisoned and we want to get out, but Life, society, puts the bars around us all.  Andy is just unique enough to be the outsider, and just normal enough to be the spokesperson for a species.<br />There is a joke in Shawshank: &quot;Everyone here is innocent; everybody knows that.&quot;  With the exception of &quot;The Sisters,&quot; I defy a person to show me a character in Shawshank who is a criminal at heart.  They may have done the crime, they are, of course, doing the time, but just which character in the prison is someone that a regular, &quot;law-abiding&quot; man or woman would be afraid of.  The inmates at Shawshank are no different than you or I.<br />They are innocent men, caught in a cruel world; at the forefront is an innocent INNOCENT man driven down beyond what, for most, would be intolerable.  How can the viewer do anything but sympathize, when it is his own face he sees though the slats of the bars, whose own picture bares the bright, red words &quot;Parole Rejected&quot; on it.  You can't punish someone you love so fiercely.<br />And then there is Hope, which takes a mind of its own in Shawshank.  People--you, me--have been overpowered before by what we consider to be the injustice of society, but we live on and live again.  For some, life ends in a cell--to live again is to break from prison or relinquish one's grasp of his own soul.  As we stand (Andy united), we hold on dearly for the soul, and we encourage our hero to do the same.  If he loses hope, so too shall we.<br />What the filmmakers of Shawshank have created is Life, at its lowest--but only temporarily.  It contradicts what people consider right, wrong, good, bad, and leaves them with their inner villain, the prisoner we all harbor, the Andy Dufresne in anticipation for escape.  This movie is OUR release from all that we fear and all that oppresses us.  Watching yourself on screen becomes the most intimate cinema experience of a lifetime.  Feeling yourself escape becomes the most important experience of a life.
B00005A1VH|4.0|Although there were more than a few details of this movie that were not accurate, overall it is a wonderful piece.  The stereotypical back-hills Tennessee accents were perhaps a bit much, but the real Alvin York didn't seem to complain when the movie was made (although he did chastize Gary Cooper for being photographed for a publicity shot holding a cigarette, something York would never do).<BR>The story is of a rough-necked young mountain man who finds religion right before WWI and then struggles with his conscience as to whether or not he can kill and still live up to his Christian ideals.  Well, God was on his side as he became an international hero (quite by accident) then went home.  the movie ends there, but I would also recomend reading a recent biography of York to see what a truly extraordinary man he was.  He wouldn't capitalize on his fame to make money, and he used what little he did have to try to build schools to bring education to the rural hills of Tennessee.<BR>Alvin York is one of the greatest examples of an American hero that we have, not because of his actions in war, but because of his actions in peace and his devotion to God, His country, and his neighbors.
0812550706|3.0|This is good. OSC did a great job and he's surely one of the best SF authers of the time. BUT I can't say it would be anyone's taste. This book is.....well, somewhat, 'tricky'. Before buying this book with all 5 stars recommendation, please think about these 3 questions. <BR>1. Have you ever read any other OSC's books?<BR>(If yes, try it)<BR>2. Do you like KIDS?<BR>(If you think today's teenagers are too 'adult-like' and don't like that thought, this book wouldn't be the best choice)  <BR>3. Which do you like more, The Forever war or Starship Troopers?<BR>(Mixed, but I personally prefer from FW to ST.)
0316776963|2.0|This is the first book by David Sedaris I have ever read and it will likely be the last. He writes well. The problem is I didn't find a lot of his writing particularly funny. Perhaps my expectations were set a little too high by the glowing reviews I had read, but I kept expecting to find myself rolling on the floor with laughter. That just didn't happen.<br />I sensed the author often thought he was writing something funny, but that only made it worse. Oh sure, Sedaris got a chuckle out of me here and there - as I said, he writes well. But the peals of laughter never came. And what was with the homosexual references, interludes, and otherwise failed humor? At times it seemed like Sedaris was trying to laugh at himself, at other times it seemed like he expected everybody to see the humor inherent in his sexual preferences. In most cases, I found the display to be out of place. That is, Sedaris' perverse sexuality usually fit into his narrative like a road kill fits on a stretch of two-lane blacktop. Sure, you expect to find one now and then, but it doesn't make the trip any more pleasant.<br />This isn't autobiographical humor along the lines of Mark Twain, or Jean Shepherd, or Patrick F. McManus. It just doesn't work the same way as any of the examples I've just given. In fact, as I see it, Sedaris' humor usually doesn't work - not for me, at least.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Ignore the Amazon editorial review and all the other reader reviews. I don't want to spoil this movie for you by telling you too much about the plot or describing in perfect detail some of the best scenes in the movie but what I will tell you is...<br />1) Yes, it's true, Dominic Sena's last directorial effort Gone In Sixty Seconds was a MAJOR dissapointment BUT SWORDFISH ISN'T!!! It's a good movie!<br />2) Travolta is good<br />3) Halle Berry is good<br />4) Don Cheadle is underused and<br />5)Hugh Jackman is a major star in the making.<br />6) The now infamous scene of Halle Berry topless was probably unnecessary and perhaps gratuitous (but hey, she's a good looking woman with a good body). Sorry, did I say good? I meant great...but if this is the only reason why you'd watch this movie, then you really do need to get a life.<br />7)This was one of the better films of the summer.<br />8)It is neither formulaic nor does it lack ambition. Unlike most movies of this genre it challenges it's audience to excercise the old grey matter and it's got a half-decent twist.<br />Sure it has some faults, like did they run out of money for FX when they shot the scene of the bus landing on the roof? And the change of pace and edit from past events back to present was badly thought out and jarred a bit. BUT you know what? I liked this movie and the directorial set-piece that everybody wants to spoil for you by describing it to you in every detail is excellent. I only wish the moviemakers had been able to take that extra step and made a great rather than good movie. Buy some popcorn, kick back and enjoy this one on a Saturday night at home in front of the TV...
0553296981|4.0|The more I read, the more I enjoyed this book. Written by a young girl in hiding from Hitler and the Nazis during World War II, Anne's diary clearly depicts the incredible emotions of a teenager during this time period. I was amazed of how mature and intellectual Anne was as a writer. While reading this book you, as well, will feel the hardships and emotions a young girl of this time felt. Repeatedly in emotional limbo, Anne continues to shine a light by being positive about her situation, making the best of her teen life in hiding, and trying to get along with everyone as much as possible. By witnessing her first kiss, her devoted love towards her father, and the small joys she managed to find while in hiding, Anne truly shows us how valuable small things in life are. Reading Anne's diary gave me a glimpse of the suffering and emotional hell millions of people suffered during this period. Although not everyone affected by this tragedy kept a diary, everyone has a story and Anne shared hers with us with true humanity. I highly recommend this book.
1892065290|5.0|A truly amazing book. This is one of (with the inclusion of Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series) the few fantasy series that portray people as people, not mythic, overblown, godlike beings who exist on a totally different plane of existence. The writing is fast paced and incredibly evocative, with the reader really feeling that he/she is a part of the action. Incredible.
B00005221L|4.0|...if you like action--Arny'll make it worth your while. Unfortunately, the transfer from film to DVD is probably poorer on this disc than most, especially in terms of image quality, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of a 5. I was stunned to see specks of dust during the title sequence. But if you love this movie, then the DVD is a nice addition to your collection.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I can't believe that people would even think that they have sold out! Those that do have no taste at all in music. This CD shows a lot of growth. It has some harder songs in it but its a lot slower than the past few albums have been. The ability of Incubus is just awesome. A great band is great becasue they can have a lot of different sounds and still sound great. Incubus has really done a wonderful job. Get this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005O5CM|4.0|Reese Witherspoon must be the most versatile and accomplished actress of her generation and in this light comedy, she not only manages to carry the movie pretty much solely on her own but she pulls it off with great gusto as the glamourous but loveable, fashion obsessed and extremely naiive, ever buoyant, bubbly blonde Elle Woods.<br />I hope I'm not being sexist but girls and women will LOVE this movie but judging by most of the comments from other guys I overhead leaving the movie theatre, most men will HATE or at least pretyend to hate this movie, although obviously I'm a guy and I enjoyed it. You don't need to know the plot. It's not high brow but it is great fun and it doesn't pretend to be high art. It knows where its aiming and seldom misses the mark. Yes it's as light as cotton candy but it's great cotton candy and it has a great star, about to be elevated to the A list. One for the ladies to enjoy and for 'macho' guys to avoid.
B000002TPS|4.0|Megadeth's 'Youthanasia' album, released in 1994 showed a drastic departure from the bands earlier masterpieces such as 'Rust in Peace' and 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying'.  The first notable change in the music is that there are no thrash songs on the album whatsoever.  This may really turn some people off.  Upon my first listen, I was very dissapointed with this CD.  But I liked the opening track &quot;Reckoning Day&quot; so I spun it a couple more times.  And what did I find out?<br />This is one of the most catchy, melodic metal CD's I own.  Each song has some value to it that makes it interesting.  There is no filler whatsoever.  Mustaine wrote most of these songs during his cocaine and heroin troubles... so there are some dark, heavy vibes throughout the album.  Just look at the cover (which is one of the best I've ever seen).  And don't get the wrong idea here, this CD is still METAL, it just isn't a full-on blitz assault that they were in the 80's.<br />The opener, &quot;Recknoning Day&quot; is just killer.  Heavy and with a great chorus, this is sure to be one of your favorites.  &quot;Train of Consequences&quot; is obviously the single of the album, and it's fairly well done.  Not one of my favorite's, but Friedmann's lead work is worth the listen.  &quot;Addicted to Chaos&quot; is another highlight with killer riffs and another great chorus.  My favorite song on the album goes to &quot;The Killing Road&quot;.  This song talks about life on tour and it's very interesting.  The lead work is mindblowing as well, reminds me of &quot;Bad Omen&quot; type stuff (from the PS...BWB album).  &quot;Victory&quot; is a play on words of all previous Megadeth songs and albums.  It seems kind of cheesy at first, but the song is so good you won't really care.  Other standout tracks include: &quot;Blood of Heroes&quot;, &quot;Black Curtains&quot; and the title track.<br />Really, the only song I don't care for is &quot;Family Tree&quot;.  The music is great, but the subject matter of the album is a little uncomfortable.  I mean, incest is just gross and I don't want to think about it ever, let alone hear about it on a metal CD.  A minor complaint, because the song still is really good musically.<br />Many people call this Megadeth's sell-out album.  I don't see that one bit because this is one of the darkest CD's I own.  Not the genre topping work of 'Rust in Peace' and 'Peace Sells...But Who's Buying', but it's a great listen on its own.  Definitely get Megadeth's 'Youthanasia', you won't be dissapointed.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This is one of the most exciting movies of the year.  I truly enjoyed the action and the speed was superb.  I would invite everyone to see this movie it is worth the money.
006092988X|5.0|Francie taught me about America, immigration, poverty, and how hard it is to be an intelligent woman.  <br />My mom let me check this book out from the public library in 1976 -- I was 8 years old. I've read it countless times over the yaars, and it shaped my career choice... I'm a History Professor, and yes, I assign this book!
B00005ATQG|5.0|Far, far better than the recent interpretation with Jeremy Irons, this one featured Peter Sellers as Quilty in one of the great bad guy characterizations in cinematic history. (Were it not for the scandalous nature of this subject matter in 1962, he's have surely won an Oscar.) The screenplay was written by Nabokov himself. So this version conveys, I think, the spirit of the affliction better than the newer film which was marred by too much (for me)offensive violence.
B00003BDXG|2.0|It's Oliver Stone. It's OTT. It's stars are Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis. It boasts Robert Downey Jnr's and Tommy Lee Jones's worst screen performances. Rodney Dangerfield is in it. Tarantino removed his name from the screenplay he was so disgusted at what they had done to it. Told straight, it could have been a good movie, a very good hard-hitting movie, instead it's a not very funny, not very well told parody of a movie that fails to get its message across because it's as subtle as a brick and sinks like one...
B00000BKDX|5.0|I have to admit there is nothing more I can add to the excellent reviews already in here other than making the following statement:<br />If you're reading this, you must be...<br />1) a Maiden fan, in which case you already own this album<br />2) new to metal and looking to discover Maiden - then you already know you have to get this album don't you?<br />3)You're not a metal fan, but love great music...<BR>THEN YOU MUST ALREADY HAVE THIS ALBUM OTHERWISE HOW WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT GREAT MUSIC IS!?!?
B00003CY0V|5.0|This movie has plenty of excitement and John Travolta and Halle Berry were the best bad crew I have seen in a while.  I truly enjoyed the movie.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|It's a great film.  My only caution is -- there were just a few  adult-like situations.  I would recommend it.
B000002J1S|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE for all true &quot;Genesis&quot; fans.  I was in my early teens in a strict boarding school living in rural southern England when Genesis was doing the &quot;Lamb&quot; tour in London.  I sneaked out, walked 20 min to the main road, then walked an hour to the train station in town in the sleet.  Hopped a train to London &amp; the rest is history.  There were TWO full sets of drums, Phil Collins was on one of them.  This was the BEST live concert I've ever been to. Enduring the punishment afterwards (cleaning horse patties out of the stables at dawn )I thought it was well worth it.<br />I've seen the Rolling Stones, the Who, Police, U2, Sex Pistols,  and many others LIVE, they were great concerts but &quot;Genesis&quot; was the best. They were avant garde for their time &amp; in many ways I thought Phil Collins had turned &quot;soft&quot; with commercial ballads.<br />I not only admired Gabriel &amp; Collins, I actually went to see the others - Banks, Hackett &amp; Rutherford perform as remarkable musicians.  I wasn't disappointed. After all these years, they're still my all time favourite.
B000002H2H|5.0|fade to black is the best song ever written, the last solo is the best solo ever.  don't listen to people who tell you otherwise.  seriously, i would buy this record 1000 times just to hear that one song.  makes me cry...
B00004Z459|4.0|I really Like This Album. My Favourite Tracks Are Runaway,Points Of Authority,Pushing Me Away And One Step Closer. As I Said Before I Really Like This Album But I Think The Special Edition Is More Worth Your Money Because You Get 'My December' And 'High Voltage' With It.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Insomnia can bring many good things to ones attention. Staying up all night gives me what I think is enough time to relax and listen to some cd's or watch some movies, after I've had a busy day and not much time to do either. So lately I've listened to cd's all night. One day while flipping through the channels on the life-long search to watch a good television show I came across the Strokes' video for 'Last Night' and was quite impressed. This, of course, sparked an interest with the band so within the next 10 minutes I had signed on and had already listened to the 30 second cheats on Amazon.com. I was no longer interested in the Strokes after that. Those 30 seconds not only made no sense but were completely boring. <BR>Throughout my day I would come across people with a good opinion of music and ask them what they thought of the Strokes. Everyone I know loves their album to death, they all insist that I buy it for I too will love it to death. I caved and picked it up. I have to say that I was more excited about looking at the cover than actually listening to the music, but there was still that tiny puddle of intrigue that told me to put that cd in as soon as I got home. I gave them their fair chance and listened to the entire album...all 35 minutes of it. It is in fact a great album and I ended up listening to it 5 times. It's not the next 'Nevermind' or 'Automatic For The People' like most people claim it to be, but it is definately a cd I would recommend to my friends if they wanted something new and laid back.  <BR>If you are at all interested in this band and think that the only songs on this album will be the singles that are catchy, then you are wrong. Every song on this cd is catchy and is worthy of being a single. If you have any interest in picking up this cd then do so and you will not be let down.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have been a fan of Incubus, since I heard the first single from the Make Yourself album, &quot;Pardon Me.&quot;  It was a very catchy song and later I purchased the album and fell in love with it.  My favorite songs were &quot;Clean&quot;, and &quot;Stellar.&quot;  Because those were my favorites on the other album,their new album, which is similar to those songs, really appeals to me.  <br />The highlights of the album are &quot;Mexico,&quot; &quot;Blood on the Ground,&quot; and &quot;Warning.&quot;  &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; is one of the heavier tracks, but has good, truthful lyrics.  &quot;I Wish You Were Here&quot; is another one of Incubus's catchy songs that is sure to garner a good bit of radio airplay.  It is more similar to &quot;Stellar&quot;, than to &quot;Drive.&quot;  &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and &quot;Circles&quot; are more guitar-driven than other songs and make for an excellent introduction to the album.  &quot;Just a Phase&quot; is an acoustic ballad, that cresendos into a thundering alternative ballad.  &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; is Incubus's most ambitious and eclectic track to-date.  A very soporific track, great ending to a memorable album.  Other tracks like &quot;Echo&quot;, which another great slow ballad, and &quot;Under the Umbrella&quot;, a mid-tempo track, show a great variety.  <br />Brandon Boyd's singing has definitely improved over the last album, so has his lyrics, but they were never bad.  This album shows a totally new direction for Incubus, they did not do an angst-filled album, nor did they do an acoustic, lucrative album, but somewhere in-between.  The album is beautiful, one of the most creative alternative album in a long time.  Great buy their best album so far.
0440234743|2.0|I count on John Grisham for a good read when I need an escape from my life.  I found myself reluctant to bother finishing this one, though I never lost hope that it would get better.  It didn't.  It read like an ad for a born-again Christian church and what little was resolved at the end wasn't worth the effort.  I couldn't help wondering if Grisham phoned this one in, or indeed if he wrote it at all.  I understand that publishers continue to publish under a best selling author's name long after he/she dies.  Maybe Grisham died and no one told him.
B00005QG9J|5.0|All these ridiculous nu-metal bands(Staind, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit etc.) suck. That is what the radio friendly sound has been for several years. Wake up! All of those bands are the one's that have sold out making uninspired noise with lame lyrical content capitalizing on teen angst. Now on to Incubus. To make a record like this would be the exact opposite of selling out. There are some great experimental tracks on this album with clever and insightful lyrics, which you don't hear on the radio much these days. On a final note I would like to say that you can't make the same album twice. Why make a record that sounded like Science all over again and never develop. That would be a waste of valuable creative energy and would get old after a while. Incubus is a great band and this is a great album.
0399208534|3.0|The Very Hungry Caterpiller is great for teaching metamorphosis but it is lacking in a few facts..... Caterpillars which wrap themselves into cocoons become moths, not butterflies.  The illustration of the butterfly is mysteriously 'top wings on bottom' upside down and my 5 year old reads this and wonders WHY the caterpillar ate so much.  For a springboard for teaching it is fine but standing alone it does not do well.
6302787564|5.0|I don't care what others say, this for me is one of the most underrated movies of all time - Michael Douglas's performance in this outshines his Oscar-winning one in &quot;Wall Street&quot;, but no one at the Academy seemed to notice.  Same goes for Robert Duvall in this movie - he definitely deserved at least a supporting actor nomination.  Oh well, what's important for me is that at least a few other people and I are able to see this movie for what it is: a fantasy version of how a middle class white man in America might implode &amp; explode in a regular day of urban frustration (this is somewhat along the lines of Glenn Close's performance in &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; - that is, someone actually acting on their inner feelings of despair and pent-up anger).  A simply marvelous piece of entertainment - and Tuesday Weld deserves a nod of recognition for her role as Duvall's once-beautiful, long-suffering and beloved wife.  A classic!
0061040967|5.0|In his second collaborative Discworld 'picture' book (the first Being &quot;Eric&quot;, which never received a proper release here in the States), Terry Pratchett shows that the momentum he seems to have regained in his last two or three books continues to mount.  While the story is his shortest novel yet, it's packed with enough adventure for two of his regular novels.<br />Featuring not only Cohen the Barbarian and Rincewind, but also Carrot, the wizards of Unseen University and Leonard of Quirm, he somehow manages to combine the legend of Prometheus with the Apollo Program while tossing in evil overlords, Schrodinger's Cat and everything you ever wanted to know about dragons.<br />The story is vintage Pratchett and the illustrations are all gorgeous.  While sometimes threatening to overwhelm the text, they work to immerse us in the Discworld in a way that, surprisingly enough, surpasses Pratchett's usual work.  From beautifully rendered characters and Discscapes to the notes of Leonard and technical schematics, they give you the feeling of a Discworld almost real enough to touch.<br />If you're a Terry Pratchett fan, I can't recommend this book enough.  Even with the somewhat steep price tag, it's well worth adding to a Pratchett collection.  If you're not overly familiar with Pratchett, I recommend starting at a different book in the series, perhaps &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; or &quot;Small Gods&quot; and then moving on to this one after getting a feel for the series.  However, once you've gotten a feel for the series, definitely come back to this one.

0694003611|5.0|After wearing out the first board book with our first child a second one was bought.  The kids love this book---- all of the nuances.  The clock shows a change in time as well as the movement of the moon and the darkening of the room.  Where is the mouse now (all over the place).  Both of our children still adore pulling this one out.  It has been read over and over, been taped, is dog-eared, etc.  To show how much it is loved one of our two copies is already in the &quot;memory&quot; box to pass on in later years.  This is a wonderful addition to the library anyone with young children, particulary if they are just starting out.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|It turned out to be a wonderful movie.  VERY funny!  Very sweet.  Great parodies.  Acting, et cetera...  You won't regret watching this movie.  If you don't want to buy it, rent it first, then you'll HAVE to buy it! :)
6302814782|5.0|I love vampire movies and I have seen them all and this is deffinintly one of the best.
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes is by far the most deeply depressing book I have ever read. Every page I read makes me thankful that I have a warm place to live and good food to eat.  I think that this is the reason I liked this book as much as I did. <br /> In the beginning chapter, Frank gave a short summery of his family's sad and morbid history. He then ventured into the meeting of his parents and his birth. This is where you start to get a sense of the sadness and depravity that he experienced though his life. This feeling lingers for the remainder of the story.  <br />Death within his family frequently occurred through out his childhood. Most of his siblings die because of mal nutrition. The reader gets the feeling that Frank doesn't understand the death of his only sister and the twins. This is another aspect that I like about McCort's writing style. He writes as if he is the character, and is at the same comprehension level. <br />With every chapter there is a sad aspect and with every uplifting moment there is a downfall.  I don't think that Frank at that age understood his father's addition, which made it harder for him to see the reason his life was like it was. He was constantly trying to impress or get approval from his family, and especially from his father. This made it even harder to see him fail at most of the things he tried to do, like being an usher for example. The only times I saw a least bit of happiness in his story was when he was ill with typhoid and his father kissed him on the head and told Frank that he loved him.   The other was when he saved enough money to go back to America, where the book came to a close.<br />This book was a tragic and really showed the audience what it was to live in the great depression as a poverty stricken young boy, and actually survive it.  The book was descriptive and realistic, as was his life.  This is why I give this book four stars.
0783242808|1.0|&quot;American Pie&quot; is just another rehash of teen sex comedies, rating up with &quot;Porky's&quot; as one of the most worst films of the last two decades. <br />Three sex-crazed teenage boys make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night. (See the similarities?) They then start to plan how to do it, starting off with many dirty nauseatingly raunchy sex jokes (masturbation, sexual orientation) that aren't even funny and it goes downhill from there.<br />&quot;American Pie&quot; is stupid, raunchy, and crude, to say the least. If you people think this is hilarious, I suggest you consult a psychiatrist. Only Alyson Hannigan gives a good performance, while the others fail miserably.<br />Rated R for crude sexual humor, language, and for some nudity.
B000002OVJ|5.0|The Who are one of my favorite bands and one of the greatest rock bands in history. Everything about them was great, from Pete Townshend's awesome songwriting, to Keith Moon's explosive drumming, John Entwistle's hyperactive bass riffs, and Roger Daltrey's primal screams. They were the original hard rock band, combining catchy, energetic pop hooks with rebellious lyrics and a guitar/bass/drum attack that laid the foundation for all the hard rock/metal acts that would follow. In my opinion, nothing captures this more effectively than the Who's 1970 classic LIVE AT LEEDS, widely regarded by many (including me) as the best live rock album ever made.<br />This album pratically defines rock & roll to me, and the remastered production makes the concert sound even more raw and unadulterated as it already is. The fact that LIVE AT LEEDS contains 14 songs and runs at a pretty hefty 77 minutes is commendable; there is not one boring moment on this record. Out of the 14-song setlist, some are cover tunes and others are Who originals. Daltrey, Moon, and Entwistle all stand out on LEEDS but to me Townshend steals the show. He slings and shreds his guitar all the way through, delivering a blistering solo on \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" then cutting through \\"I Can't Explain,\\" \\"Fortune Teller,\\" and \\"Tattoo\\" before the band finally reaches the incredible \\"Young Man Blues\\" where he plays like there's no tomorrow.<br />I'd say the best performance on here belongs to \\"A Quick One, While He's Away,\\" the band's first stab at a rock opera... Keith Moon goes nuts when Entwistle's part comes in, the melodies are solid, the finale is mind-blowing. There is nothing else to say about LIVE AT LEEDS. It's the best live album (only Rush's EXIT...STAGE LEFT comes close). The liner notes are pretty interesting as well. If any doubts the Who's power, just look at their recent performance at the Concert for New York. They are the best live band.
B000002UZ4|5.0|Three years ago, I was given this cd, Pet Shop Boys - Discography, by an uncle of mine, as he didn't want it anymore. I don't know why I took it, and I wasn't in any hurry to listen to it.  For the next few years it remained untouched in a bookcase, and then, about five months ago, I was sorting out some cd's and I came across it. It was late at night, and I was tired, but I put the cd into the player.......<br />and was amazed.<br />The quality of the songs was excellent, and from the very beginning,West End Girls really stood out.  All the songs are excellent! I totally dug them all and now I'm an avid PSB fan.  If you're a novice pethead, Discography is a great place to start. Worked for me!
B000001FMC|4.0|Swing Out Sister was one of many jazz/blues vocal groups from the late eighties.  Others included Seal, Simply Red and Sade.  This type of music was very popular for a short time, because it was the only innovative music around.  The music industry had been dominated by disco and dance, which was dying, New Wave, which was getting stale and Corporate Rock, which is never any good.  This jazz/blues music filled in the space before Alternative rock really took off.<br />This is a very nice album, blending jazz, blues and electronic rhythms. The lead singer has the perfect voice for this jazz/blues style of music.  The compositions are all very good.<br />This is Swing Out Sister's first album on a major label.  Like many groups, they have an earlier album on an independent label, which contains many of the songs here.<br />The LP version had 9 tracks.  The CD adds 4 bonus tracks, which are just extended dance mixes of 4 or the 9 tracks. Except for the extended mix of Surrender, none of these extended mixes are any good.  Sections of the songs are looped to make them longer.  It is not well done, and the extended mixes are just annoying and repititious.<br />None of Swing Out Sisters later albums are nearly as good as this one.  They are more pop oriented and have no energy or life.
0783244320|4.0|Wow, a sci-fi spoof that not only pokes fun at sci-fi/space opera shows, but also takes aim at the fans and conventions! It even goes after the actor's love/hate relationships with each other. Much like the original Trek crew's general dislike of William Shatner, the broken-down thespians of \\"GalaxyQuest\\" don't particularly care for the attitude of the `captain' (Tim Allen). Then there's the `crushy, chompy things' scene that rags on space opera shows' more implausible plot devices &amp; gimmicks used to add suspense to the adventure. There's even a `Thermian' language track (a very annoying language to listen to after 30 seconds, BTW), which I'm sure is a take-off of the unbelievable popularity of the Klingon tongue; a language that's actually taught at some colleges no less!<br />Although `Star Trek' is never mentioned in the movie or `making of' documentary, its influence can definitely be seen, especially by one who's immersed him/herself in the sci-fi/space opera culture, and has hit a few geek conventions. The con clips of the \\"Galaxy Quest\\" show had the exact look and style of the original series episodes. The cardboard bridge, the paper-mache rocks that made up the `planetbound' scenes- it's all too familiar to the hardcore Trekkie. They even take a shot at the NextGen show, with a (then) twelve-year-old flying the ship a la Wesley Crusher! And the NSEA Protector looks like it could fit right in with any other ship in the UFP's Starfleet. All in all, \\"Galaxy Quest\\" is a really good poke at `Trek's look and style, yet done in a way that also pays tribute to the show and its subsequent space-opera competitors &amp; spin-offs.<br />I was also amazed by make-up/creature FX designer Stan Winston's work on this flick. Winston combines the various E.T.s' other-worldly `realism' with a just a smidge of cartoonish Muppet-style silliness to make them look real, yet unreal at the same time. General Sarris and his minions exemplified this look to a T: threateningly deadly, yet yet a tad silly-looking, too. The pig-lizard thingy and the Thermians' `true' appearances also displayed a neat combo of strange and ridiculous.<br />As for features &amp; extras, this offering has all that one would pretty much expect from a big-budget digital video release. The picture &amp; sound clarity are top-notch. And of course it's in widescreen so you can see the whole thing without missing what's on the right and left. Then there's the usual theatrical trailer &amp; cast/crew career bios &amp; production notes thrown in. Of course, ther's also those things that aren't always present in every DVD release, such as outtakes, cut scenes, and a secondary dialogue track (the aforementioned Thermian dub). I found most of the cut scenes rather amusing, and I was disappointed that many of them weren't restored to the movie itself. Some of them, however, had incomplete CGI effects, and a few were alternate scenes with different outcomes from what was shown in the movie, which likely made it hard for the DreamWorks powers-that-be to pick &amp; choose between what should be restored and what should not. Oh well...<br />`Late
B00005B36H|4.0|I bought this album on a recommendation by the drummer in my band.  It is a fantastic album, Danny Carey displays his occult/hermetic influences for all to see (hear) in the poly rhythms he plays and the artwork.<br />I compared Tool to Rush for a few reasons in the title.  First of all, you can hear Neil Peart in Danny Carey's drumming, except (and most die-hard Rush fans will put me on their \\"to ...\\" list for this) he seems to have surpassed Neil outright.  I am a big fan of Rush myself, so don't think I say this because I favour Tool or anything.<br />The second (and more important) reason I compare these two is because of the vocals.  Now, I must say that Geddy and Maynard are octaves away from each other in their register.  They are very closely related, however, in that I find that the music is sometimes rendered unlistenable by their respective vocal styles.  Geddy may be quite shrill, but he is very dynamic.  Maynard's lyrics are superb on this album, but the actual melodies he sings sound very unoriginal.<br />I'm sorry to insult the person in the band with whom many Tool fans identify most closely, but it seems as if the lyrical melodies were an after thought.  I have been told that the band writes the music around Maynard's poetry (he has some great poetry on this album), but it seems like the actual melodies he sings were written hours before the recording sessions.<br />Bottom line:  Insanely great as an instrumental album, but Maynard really drags them down with his singing.  Should've been a spoken-word album.
0553274503|5.0|Buy this book! I recently finished Flowers for Algernon and I was blown away. It is a very strange but successful mix of science and human relations. Charlie is a mentally retarded man who works in a bakery and greets life with a positive attitude despite his restrictions. Having a chance to \\"better\\" himself and become smarter, Charlie takes place in a scientific experiment along with a mouse called Algernon (hence the title). As his knowledge becomes enhanced he also learns new adversities that creep up such as the realization of the cruelty of others. Soon after Charlie gains brain power, he falls in love and learns to deals with life on his own. Charlie's experience is told through a series of progress reports he was told to make by the head scientists.<BR>This novel gave me a smack in the face about the reality that people are constantly prejudiced against for things beyond their control. Open this book and the interesting writing style the author uses just compells you to find out more. And you'll have to read the book, because I'm not giving away any more!
0553106635|5.0|Who actually gave this book less than 5 stars? I saw the rating when looking through Amazon today, and I couldn't believe someone could rate this less than 5. Martin doesn't care who dies, nor does he care who wins. More than that, there are no lines of good and evil drawn. Anyone that's read other reviews, or the book will see this. More than this, though, is his style. He can write, and he can write well. Not all of the Fantasy of our Era is well written. This, however, is well written. Full marks for a well written book, book 4 is highly anticipated.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is an amazing album. She has the talent to go with the moves and that doesn't happen very often.  No matter what anyone says this girl has it all and I'm glad she is a representative of my generation. Keep it up!!!!
6304457383|5.0|Occasionally, there's a book or a film that reduces us to the iteration of the most overused superlatives in the language, that robs us of our wonted articulacy and compels us to elate exclamations of praise.  \\"Wait Until Dark\\" is one such masterwork.<br /><br />Alan Arkin's sinister character, and Audrey Hepburn's unbreakably fragile blind woman, are two of the best performances in cinematic history.  The script is marvellously devoid of tawdriness, of slackness, of shabbiness, and of gratuitous violence (though violence, implicit and explicit, does exist).<br /><br />The action occurs in a Greenwich Village apartment, for the most part.  Three men, led by the bullying Arkin, are convinced that the Hendrixes (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. and Audrey Hepburn) have come into possession of a doll that has been stuffed with narcotics.  These men (Richard Crenna pretending to be a friend of Audrey's absent husband, Jack Weston impersonating a police sergeant) orchestrate an elaborate charade to distract, and to menace, Suzy Hendrix into revealing the whereabouts of the doll.<br /><br />Crucial to the plot is a young neighbour of the Hendrixes named Gloria (played by Julie Herron, with sufficient skill as to make us wonder about her other work in films).<br /><br />Are there flaws?  Very few indeed.  The streets of Greenwich Village are curiously unpopulous at all hours of the day, and Arkin's disguises are superfluous (Audrey's character being blind), except inasmuch as they entertain the audience.<br /><br />Arkin's casual, almost insouciant, sadism is an exquisite piece of acting (somewhat different from the affable Judge Rifkind of A&E's \\"100 Centre Street,\\" but no less deserving of acclaim!); and Audrey Hepburn's Suzy is so compelling that we begin to perceive a small injustice in the fact that 1967's Best Actress Oscar went to \\"the other Hepburn\\" (for \\"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\\").  Yes, please do see this film!

6300182150|4.0|This 1978 film by John Landis follows the wild adventures of a group of fraternities on the campus of Faber College.  There are many familiar faces in Animal House, but John Belushi as &quot;Bluto&quot; stole the show.  John Belushi's, as well as the other member's of the Delta House's, parties, food fights, cheating on test, vandalism is just a few reasons why Dean Wormer wanted to rid the campus of The Delta House.  Delta House was comprised of fun-loving, sloppy, middle class guys who drank and smoked everyday and lived for pulling pranks on the Omega House Fraternity and Dean Wormer.   Dean Wormer finally won the battle and kicked Delta House off the campus, but Delta House's revenge was awesome.  A must see!!  I give this movie 4 stars because it is truly hilarious!
1572522232|5.0|this movie is so powerful and hypnotic that i find it hard to imagine exaggerating it's importance to the horror genre and film as a whole.  although i was appalled by the violence in it and have trouble understanding people who like argento's work solely for the brutal and repugnant scenes of misogyny and over the top murder, every other aspect of this movie was damn near perfect.  it something of a puzzle, truly a paradox and a fascinating one to reflect on:something i can't quite articulate about it prevents it from being an empty exercise in style and gives it substance, be it not of an intellectual or moral kind. if you describe this movie to most people they will shrug their shoulders and say, &quot;sounds like a cheesy, stupid horror movie.&quot; and indeed the plot sounds so absurd (a dance school run by a coven of witches), that before seeing the movie we would probably think this ourselves after being told about the plot. but when you actually experience it, there is something incredibly effective and absolutely unforgettable about it, and the earnest viewer cannot doubt after one viewing that argento is nothing less than a horror movie genius in the league of tobe hooper or alfred hitchcock. a terrifying and utterly engrossing plunge into the world of the imagination and the supernatural, this movie has a surreal and otherworldly beauty that simply defies description.  argento is the ETA Hoffmann of horror films in that he can come up with the most ludicrous and laugh out loud plots and somehow allow us, through the sheer magic and overwhelming atmosphere of fear and terror, to suspend our disbelief and critical intelligence and lose ourselves in the movie.  susy banyon is a none too bright or extaordinary but strong willed and talented young woman (jessica harper's performance is a bit one dimensional and doe eyed but still memorable) who transfers to a prestigious dance school in another country and slowly discovers the terrible truth about the academy she has so eagerly decided to attend. i personally couldn't take my eyes off it from the opening scene in the airport to the last sequence where susy has an unfortunate encounter with 'mater suspiriorum'.  the soundtrack is in itself a classic and fits perfectly with the movie, and provides a perfect compliment to the dreamlike, multi colored glow of the academy's interior.  this movie is so frightening and eerie that it made a friend who i introduced to it, a film student, very uncomfortable and as i could immediately tell after about half an hour, just plain scared. this is not only a must see but an absolute necessity, not to be rented but to be bought and bought fast.  argento's later work is a joy to the horror/surrealism fan as well, but this is undeniably his best movie and the masterpiece on which his cult following rests.  the best movie he made next to &quot;suspiria&quot;, i feel, is &quot;inferno&quot;, which is a sequel (of sorts) to the latter in that it deals with &quot;the three mothers&quot; and their power over the world.  in both movies, although &quot;inferno&quot; is clearly the lesser, argento creates captivating and dreamlike world of terror and malevolent forces secretly working against unsuspecting victims who are unlucky enough to accidentally gain knowledge or awareness of these not very kind women.  buy both movies, and see all of his work.  this guy's stuff should be known to everyone.she has so eagerly decided to attend. i personally couldn't take my eyes off it from the opening scene in the airport to the last sequence where susy has an unfortunate encounter with 'mater suspiriorum'.  the soundtrack is in itself a classic and fits perfectly with the movie, and provides a perfect compliment to the dreamlike, multi colored glow of the academy's interior.  this movie is so frightening and eerie that it made a friend who i introduced to it, a film student, very uncomfortable and as i could immediately tell after about half an hour, just plain scared. this is not only a must see but an absolute necessity, not to be rented but to be bought and bought fast.  argento's later work is a joy to the horror/surrealism fan as well, but this is undeniably his best movie and the masterpiece on which his cult following rests.  the best movie he made next to &quot;suspiria&quot;, i feel, is &quot;inferno&quot;, which is a sequel (of sorts) to the latter in that it deals with &quot;the three mothers&quot; and their power over the world.  in both movies, although &quot;inferno&quot; is clearly the lesser, argento creates captivating and dreamlike world of terror and malevolent forces secretly working against unsuspecting victims who are unlucky enough to accidentally gain knowledge or awareness of these not very kind women.  buy both movies, and see all of his work.  this guy's stuff should be known to everyone.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This movie was very, very powerful.   Kudos to the director for using a variety of film styles to illustrate the various worlds of drug abuse.  All the actors were  brilliant in this film, but Ellen Burstyn's performance was one of the most astounding I've seen in many years.  My heart, lungs, and spleen just dropped to the floor when I witnessed what her character went through.  I think this film should be standard viewing for young and old because it doesn't celebrate drug use. It very vividly exposes its horrible effects.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I've been a fan of Incubus for some time now, and I was really looking forward to Morning View. I wasn't dissappointed. One of the most striking elements of Morning View is its less polished, and more intimate feel. Songs like &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; and &quot;Under My Umbrella,&quot; while not necessarily faster than the material on S.C.I.E.N.C.E., is definitely harder. Mike Einziger's playing is at its most abrasive on Morning View.  At the same time however, it's at its most hypnotic, most notably on the trance-inducing &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; and the stunningly beautiful &quot;Echo.&quot;<BR><BR>Brandon Boyd has vastly matured as both a singer and songwriter. His maturity is especially apparent on &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; as well as the more tranquil numbers like &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;11 a.m.&quot; &quot;Have You Ever&quot; sears with volcanic emotion, which pairs nicely to Einziger's thunderous, precise playing. &quot;Just a Phase&quot; has so be one of the quirkiest songs Incubus has ever recorded, while Brandon sounds almost veangeful on the two opening tracks, &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and &quot;Circles.&quot;<BR><BR>My only complaint, and it's a small one, is the decreased presence of DJ Kilmore. However, when he is given a chance to throw some electronic pizazz into the mix, he doesn't dissappoint. This adds layers of atmosphere to the songs.<BR><BR>Overall, Morning View finds Incubus exploring more of their potential as musicians. It's refreshing to see a band that isn't fixated on making the same album over and over. There isn't another &quot;Drive&quot; on this album.  While one may consider this a bad thing, the musicianship, maturity, and genuine soul displayed on Morning View makes &quot;Drive&quot; sound like boy band drivel. Having said that, their next album probably won't have another &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; or &quot;Echo,&quot; and in the case of Incubus, that's how it should be.
0393317552|5.0|This book is a masterpiece on how superiority in knowledge ends up in triumph and ignorance in virtual extinction. In the wake of regional and inter-continental migration that are brought to life in this book, the gene and &quot;memes&quot; pools were altered beyond recognition. Knowledge of history and literary finesse made the book a beauty in its own class. Whoever claims a leadership position in societies should seek to draw lessons from the great waves of migration that Jared Diamond put together as coherence in this book. Those who care about diversity may raise the question on what is likely to come centuries after this short episode in human evolution.
B000021YQV|3.0|I like this CD, but I don't. I feel schizophrenic about it.<br />There are moments when I can hear the System of A Down I have known for 5 years on the Los Angeles club scene and then there are some moments where I think I have accidently slipped a Slayer CD in (who, I am not that fond of and I suppose it's not that unusual considering the producer has produced Slayer for years).<br />Overall, the first CD is better, it's rougher and it has a real metal/punk edge to it (you can hear them channel the Dead Kennedy's in several tracks).<br />It's not bad per se, but it's a little too polished for my liking....but it's certainly more cerebral metal than say, Korn or Mudvayne or god forbid Slipknot.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is one of the best. It really shows off Hanks' acting ability. The casting of Robin Wright as Jenny was also excellent. If you are looking for the perfect &quot;feel good&quot; movie this is the one!! To think that Forrest did all of those things is sometimes hard to imagine, but overall still an excellent watch.

Major bummer - the DVD can't be returned once opened!

B00005NWM3|2.0|The lead singer has a great voice and the song &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; is awesome; however, the other songs don't measure up to that track. The other songs seem like filler that was added to the single to make an album out of the one good song.  I highly recommend listening to this at a listening station before purchasing....better yet, download the one good song!

0140131558|4.0|\\"New York Trilogy\\" is intelligent, interesting, and inventive, albeit problematic in some ways. The trilogy contains three novellas that largely stand on their own, but also bear some relationship to each other. The novellas could be considered reinvented or perhaps dysfunctional detective stories of sorts. While each involves a mystery, they lack the action and denouement of traditional detective stories. Instead, the mystery behind each story is something of an intellectual conundrum that engages the reader with the act of authorship. Who and what is the writer? What are the writer's motives? What happens when the writer attempts to solve a mystery (as in \\"City of Glass\\")? What happens when the writer is the source of a mystery (as in \\"The Locked Room\\")? The novellas are largely metaphorical (the writer as a detective, the writer's brain as a locked room, the writer as more than one person) and are rewarding on a symbolic level. Unfortunately, Aster is a skilled enough detective writer to lead us down a non-existent path of genuine mystery. \\"The Locked Room\\" contains enough tension and ingredients to make us believe we are reading a real detective story. The largely intellectual conclusion comes as something of an anti-climax and almost makes me wonder if the story ran wild in Auster's head to the point where he could not think of a suitable way to finish it. Issues like this and the stiffness of the language bothered me to some degree but did not diminish my appreciation of Auster's work. This is certainly one of the more inventive books I've encountered and I enjoyed it tremendously. Whether or not it is Post-Modern or can be attributed any other academic trope is of course irrelevant.
B000002HRE|1.0|Anyone unfortunate enough to buy this has my sympathy. This, in my opinion, is not Metallica. Whilst the 'Black Album' changed Metallica's standing within the genre, it still echoed their musical brilliance. This, however, does not bare considering. 'Load' was pretty appalling in comparison to the afore mentioned album, but this, I feel, has lowered the standards. There are people that will testify that this is creativity, and that fans of early Metallica cannot handle this. I believe the real truth is that we do indeed recognise that this is a change of direction, it is just that it is not very good; awful in fact.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliot is a must-see for anyone who remembers pursuing the seemingly impossible dreams of their youth.  Set in a coal-mining town in Northern England during a miner's strike, it is the story of a boy (brilliantly played by Jamie Bell) whose natural talent for dance unfairly characterizes him as gay.  But his persistence wins over not only his family, but the striking miners, as well.<br />The &quot;R&quot; rating is unfortunate and (in my opinion) unwarranted, and is most likely for the frequent use of the &quot;F-word.&quot;  But the language is realistic and not offensive (and not used in a sexual context), and I had no problems showing it to a Senior High Church youth group.<br />I found the DVD to be helpful by using the English subtitles, since, although the film is in English, the dialect was often hard to follow.  With the subtitles, however, (which I didn't use the first time I saw it), the dialogue was much easier to follow.
B000002JOH|5.0|Any album that this band produces is inevitably labelled as bone-crunchingly heavy. This album is not really different in this respect than to any of Pantera's other albums. However, it just has that 'something else' that the others do not. It is by far their best album, despite producing some classic material after this. No, this is the Pantera album that you want. The others are good, do not get me wrong, but they cannot quite equal this.

0684872153|5.0|I give Angela's Ashes five stars.  It was excellent. It is a biography of a child's life and he tells what his life was like living in Ireland with no money, a father who could careless if his family was starving, relatives that treat him like dirt, man of the house because your father is out drinking in pubs, his sister that died in America which is the reason why they moved to Ireland in th first place and his two twin brothers dying one right after another in Ireland. <BR>  In this book you could visualize what Frankie was talking about when you were reading.  I could put myself into his shoes and see how hard he had his life.  I could picture in my mind how skinny and thin Frankie and his brothers were because they didn't have much to eat, what there clothes looked like all dirty and old, and sleeping with only a couple of old coats as blankets and freezing at night.<BR>  This book showed me I shouldn't take everything I get for granted but to be grateful for what I get and have because I am lucky to have it.

6302662648|5.0|While Sneakers boasts an incrediblely talented ensemble cast, the focus in this fun movie is never on just one character for too long of a period, and the result is a great escapist tale, and truly entertaining as well.  There are so many great moments contained in Sneakers that it takes several viewings to really understand just how fine those moments are!  <br />David Strathairn's &quot;Mother&quot; character really stands out, and the scenes where he slowly begins putting together a simulation soundtrack as to what Redford's character &quot;Marty&quot; heard while kidnapped and in the trunk of a car, are spellbinding!  <br />Spellbinding as well is the performance of Ben Kingsley, who takes his time getting to the screen, but it's worth the wait as he ever so slowly steals the movie away from the rest of the cast.  His &quot;chat&quot; with Marty, where he, &quot;Cosmo,&quot; finally reveals himself to Marty, and then launches into a discourse of what the real world, in his eyes, is really like and all about, is stunning!  This is one of his best performances, and while certainly not his longest, it's incredible to watch him more than hold his own with Redford in their scenes together!  <br />Timothy Busfield's turn as a bad guy is great fun, similar to but much more sinister than his brother-in-law role in Field Of Dreams.....here's hoping he gets the opportunity to take on some more of these types of roles in the future.  And what a treat to see an actor the calibur of Sidney Poitier in this one......he certainly has his fine moments here as well, and the scenes that showcase his ability to be greatly agitated yet under complete control all at the same time are pure acting lessons!  <br />Great fun, great story, excellent cast........it's all here for the viewing.

B00004WGAI|5.0|What makes this version of JANE EYRE superior to the other versions out there is not the cast (although they're fantastic), or the production quality (it's your typical studio-video BBC production of the '80s), but the script.  Alexander Baron's adaptation of the book is the only one that remains true not just in deed and word, but in spirit to the classic novel.  While most adaptations focus on the romance and melodrama of the governess-in-the-northern-wilds, turning JANE EYRE into a flat imitation of WUTHERING HEIGHTS, Baron's script manages to also retain the humor and intelligence of Bronte's novel, which makes the characters three-dimensional, human, and fully engaging.  Rochester's, &quot;Am I hideous, Jane?&quot; is answered, [in Bronte's original dialogue], with Jane's loving, &quot;Yes, sir.  You always were, you know.&quot;  This production is romantic, funny, touching, and thoroughly alive.  Well worth the price.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I think this is one of the best movies that has been made recently.  Unfortunately, many people do not take the time to appreciate it or look for the meanings that it is trying to convey.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie is going to affect different people in different ways.  <br />Many people said that the characters in this movie, and their stories that are told, are boring or lead nowhere.  First of all, I do not agree with these statements.  The characters in this movie are incredible, as is the acting.  They show the flaws that are in real people.  I agree, Tom Cruise's character is offensive and crude in the beginning.  What is incredible about his character, however, is what happens when his past is revealed during the interview.  The breakdown of the confident front he presents makes him a real person and a character that can be related to.  We just never understood where he was coming from before.  This is an even more important part of the movie for me.  I think the movie is not so much about the individual stories, but the fact that they cross paths and the way in which they do so.  The movie plays with the expectations that we have in people.  I think it makes the point that too often in life we judge people without understanding where they come from or what is going on in their lives.  There are so many ironic moments that change our understanding of characters and create a new emotion for them.  For example, when Philip Seymour Hoffman's character orders pornographic magazines we orignially take him to be a dirty person with sex on his mind.  When the magazines arrive, however, we see that he is merely trying to help Earl Partridge find his son.  This moment creates a new sympathy for his character.  <br />In addition, the cinematography of this movie is brilliant.  There color and lighting throughout the movie add to the darkness and emptiness of the movie.  Furthermore, there are many beautiful shots and the edits connectingthe storylines are often incredible.  The parallel montage of the film is difficult to pull off, but I think it is well done.<br />Overall, I think this is a brilliant movie.  I agree that it is not a movie you are going to enjoy if you're looking for a movie that is pure entertainment and that you won't have to think about.  It's also a movie that you probably won't understand or appreciate completely the first time you watch it.  If that's what you want, then don't watch Magnolia.  If you want to appreciate film and all it has to offer, give this movie a chance, you won't be dissapointed.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I supposed I must live in a sort of media-free cave, because somehow I went on living my ordinary life for months without  hearing the name &quot;The Strokes&quot; uttered even once.<br />Then a few days ago - my ears were opened. One of my friends kept trying to push the album on me. &quot;What do you mean you've never heard of them? Everyone's talking about them. They sound like The Stooges.&quot; Well, I'm not one for listening to things that everyone else listens to, but I am one for The Stooges, so I gave it a listen. <br />And with that - a die-hard Strokes fan was born. I love it. Simple. Pure. Different. I haven't found a group I like this much since Weezer. <br />I am so glad I didn't hear any of the hype, because I would have automatically put up a barrier - like you might be doing right now. But trust me, don't let the media ruin The Strokes. Ignore the fact that they might have single on TRL - Just let yourself enjoy this album for what it is - a brilliant piece of work.
B0000563AU|5.0|I pity all of you who didn't see the original Dr. Feelgood (Wilko Johnson, John B. Sparks, The Big Figure and Lee Brilleaux) on stage (I did!), but here is an album that gives you a good taste of their act (it's mono). It's very rhythm'n'blues, Wilko's guitar is hypnotic, the performance is maniac, and everything is just as it should be. If you like simple and powerful r&amp;b, I recommend this album (as well as Feelgood's albums Malpractice and Stupidity) very strongly.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This is the pinnacle of UFO's achievements and indeed one of the best live albums of all time.<br />Heavy metal with melody that doesn't skimp on the power.  Would that they had been huge worldwide.

0553296981|3.0|I think that this book is overrated in that it is not all that it was cut out to be. A diary of a young girl growing up in hiding during this time period should portray more than just her moods and her advanced vocabulary and how she has grown emotionally over the years she is secluded from the rest of the troubled world. Either it should have had more or what it did say should have been more captivating to the reader. It is very hard for me to give my opinion on a book that did not just come from a great amount of thought but from a young person's actual life. I sort of feel like I am not giving it a chance and I should research more into Anne's life before I say anything about her diary because I know she went through more than what the reader is able to know. I do know a couple people who have visited the \\"Secret Annexe\\" and from what they have said I think I would enjoy the book much more and understand everything she says a little better if I had a better idea of where she was and how everything happened.<br />  The book would probably be much more moving and powerful to me if I saw where it took place. Since I have not been there yet all I can say is that this autobiography, describing several years of a young Jewish girl's life in hiding during the Holocaust, did not reach me the way I had expected it to and I did not get the same feeling that many of my peers and teachers did when they read it. Before reading the book I thought that I would be able to feel Anne's pain, that through her diary entries I would be able to almost relate to her, though not fully because obviously I have no idea exactly what it was like. In this way I was disappointed in the book although the way she wrote with such maturity really amazed me and how she could actually say that she was lucky compared to what other people that she once knew were going through despite how scared and bored she was really captured me and made me see parts of her personality that I doubt anyone who lived with her saw.with her saw.
B000002KMY|5.0|It really is a pity that Ronnie James Dio and Tony Iommi cannot get along in the same band, because when they are together, the results are superlative.<br />&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; to me is the Sab's finest hour, but this is a worthy successor.  If anything it is heavier.  Vinnie Appice's drumming is excellent, if not as distinctive as Bill Ward.  Add to that the trademark guitar/bass interplay of Iommi and Geezer Butler, with that amazing Dio voice soaring above it all.<br />I remember reading stories of this tour being very nerve-racking, with people going to the concerts just to yell &quot;Ozzy!&quot;  Silly.<br />Highlights too numerous to mention, but definitely &quot;The Sign Of The Southern Cross&quot;.<br />Please break out of your &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;War Pigs&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot; prejudice and give it a listen.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickelback's CD &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; has to be one of the best alternate albums out at the moment. I say that because I am not stuck listening to one liked song, all the songs on this album are worth a listen. The vocals are emotive but more than that it's the lead singer himself. There's this mixture of personal style and husky undertones. I could compare it to that of Scott Stapp from &quot;Creed&quot;, who is also one of the great alternate singers of this time. I bought the CD for &quot;How you remind me&quot; but I ended up keeping it at the top of my pile cause it's one you can turn on and keep on listening to. I appreciate a band who can not only have great music and be alternate without the majority of lyrics being curses and screams. EXCELLENT!
B000002KIK|4.0|Of course, Ozzy's last album with the band.  Almost universally reviled except for those who have to worship everything Mr Osbourne appears on.<br />Very odd production; almost garage-y in places, especially the drums.<br />I actually like the songs here better than on &quot;Technical Ecstasy&quot;.  The title track, &quot;Johnny Blade&quot; and &quot;Junior's Eyes&quot; are all fine, as is &quot;Shock Wave&quot;.<br />Again, though, will sell simply because of Ozzy's presence.
B000005H3M|5.0|... just clean, clean as a whistle jazz to which you just gotta grin.  There's nothing like the Big Band anywhere else, and in no other \\"live\\" recording did the Buddy Rich band come alive more than right here, folks.  I had the original record on Pacific Jazz back in the late '60's, and everyone I knew (we were in high school then) absolutely loved it!  When I found it in CD a number of years ago, I picked up my jaw, took out my wallet and ran straight home to hear it in all of its flawless, digital glory.  I haven't stopped listening to it since.  The beat goes on, man!  There's none better than this.  Check out \\"New Blues,\\" along with \\"Love For Sale,\\" and, of course, \\"The Beat Goes On,\\" the latter of which is the greatest music-to-drive-by of the century.  Great for parties, great for work, and drop-dead great all around.  This CD will put you out in the orbit of Neptune and you won't even have to pick up the tab for the rocket fuel. Drop your socks and call the law--Buddy's back!
B00005NKKY|3.0|I thought this would be pleasant to listen to in my office, but a few places blast out suddenly.  Another problem is that the tracks are sooooo short -- I guess that's how they did them in the old days. Nevertheless, this is a good CD and I would like to own more Simon & Garfunkel CDs.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Most young today people associate The Beach Boys music with surfing,cars,chicks and fun,fun,fun.Thus when the songs,Wouldn't It Be Nice,Sloop John B,and God Only Knows are recycled for the umpteenth time on a compilation album,it's easy to overlook the wonderful production,as well as the depth of its parent album Pet Sounds.Since it set the standard for albums for over forty years,most seemed lost on its impact.But when you truly listen and get inside these songs that you really experience the beauty of this album.The aforementioned themes are replaced with songs of introspection and more adult themes.Brian Wilson's need to compete with The Beatles turned into burning creativity as he recorded Pet Sounds with meticulous attention to detail.Using some of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew as well as the famed Wall Of Sound technique,the albums complexity was nothing short of amazing.Songs like That's Not Me,Here Today and Caroline No display both beauty and sadness in their own unique way.Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows,and Waiting for the Day are rays of light that seems on the brink of turning into dashed dreams.The Beach Boys harmonies are flawless though since Brian sings most of the leads,you'd almost think they're guest stars on their own album.Even for all its accolades,Pet Sounds was deemed a failure back in '66(due to the general publics as well as Capitol Records inability to understand and embrace the record)But over the years it has left the other Beach Boys albums in the dust,as well as accorded its own boxed set.In '66 no one seemed to think how way ahead of its time it was,nowadays it  exist outside of it.

B00005QIPH|4.0|The Strokes' rock status remains yet undetermined, perhaps they are not rock's-next-big-thing;<BR>but they give fans a reason to hope.  This is the most consistently good 1st album, first-through-last- song, that has come around in years.  The band definitely has a stripped-down New York appeal in the tradition of Velvet Underground, Television, and even Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers.  An offering reminiscent and on par with the relative successes of the Replacements and Material Issue.  Ultimately, the album may not boast a lasting anthem or hit song, but each selection plays at an even cool.   While the music may not be innovative, it is undeniably more creative and talented than its contemporaries.   After all, how can you deny a band with a lead singer named Julian Casablancas?
B000001E8P|5.0|Jarvis reached his peak with this album ... More accessible than This Is Hard Core, this is irresistable, intelligent grown-up pop music at its best.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I have seen most of this 2 DVD set, and find that the added scenes in the Pod Race and the Air Taxi scene on Coruscont make it a lot better and closer to the novel. The behind the scenes extras on Disc 2 are well worth the price I paid for it at my local BJ's Whole Sale Club (about the same price as listed for this DVD (used) on Amazon.com)<BR> I had rented this DVD set before buying it and saw most of the<BR>special features on Disc 2, my only problem was with the version selected to view as for some reason the names of the Directors involved in making the film,(George Lucas &amp; company) would come up on screen as though I had selected the audio commentery feature of the Disc. <BR> Those who put this down and call it a ploy for marketing Toys and Action Fiqures are out of thier minds and just don't get it, though I have to admit that the discrepency between Episodes I &amp; IV in relation to Obi-Wan's memory of meeting and knowing R2D2 &amp; C3PO when Luke Skywalker first meets him can be explained, as: 1.)C3PO did not have his outer shell on him when they first met, and that Obi-Wan was correct in saying &quot;I don't seem to remember ever owning an Astro Droid&quot; because he never did own one.  2.)The Droids were never introduced to him after he rescued Luke Skywalker from the Sand People in Episode IV.  3.) The R2 series of Astro Droids look a lot a like with only differences in shapes and colors of the units, and how would Obi-Wan know that this R2 unit was the same one from long ago when he was still an apprentice to Qui-Gon  as was shown in Episode I.<BR> All in all I say that this is a good Disc to own, rent it for yourself and see, if you like it by it it's worth the price for any True Star Wars fan.
0064407667|1.0|I have to say that this is absolutely the worst piece of literature i ever read.  This is NOT HOW REAL KIDS ACT.  First of all they would have resorted to violence, there must have been an assortment of tools they could have used to knock him unconcious with.  Or they could have, I don't know, RUN AWAY. They're millionaires after a while of refusing to go back they would put them some place else.  There are so many ways that this book could have been different and make it ACTUALLY GOOD and worth reading.  But other then that just picture three really idiotic kids, make them do all the stupidest things possible and not trying to save their own lives, I think it was more like a book about suicide then anything else.

B000056H24|4.0|During the film, I was slightly disappointed.  I felt there was something lacking in the script, and I kept criticizing Max Von Sydow's actions as Christ.  Afterwards, however, my mind changed a great deal.  As a Christian, I would not be surprised if other Christians have wondered about what Jesus of Nazareth was really like.  I have talked with my priest on this issue -- Jesus viewed from a human standpoint, or from a divine standpoint?  Did Jesus know with all his heart that he was the One, and was he dignified in all that he did?  How sure was he of himself, and what did he do when he approached controversial situations?  I felt that The Greatest Story Ever Told portrayed Christ as a man who KNEW he was from up above, and that that was the way he carried himself (quite a contrast from Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ).  And when I came to realize this, I became even more impressed with the carefulness of Sydow's acting ability, and the director's ability to capture the sensitivity of Christ who knew he was the Son of God as well as the Son of Man.  Sydow plays a very composed Christ, one who thinks quietly, moves in a most calm manner, is most sure of his path in his life, fearless, all-knowing, and most dignified.  He was incredibly contemplative and was careful with his powers -- As God, he had the capabilities of performing miracles non-stop, but knowing that faith alone saves the sinner, he was careful with his treatments.  The simple appreciation and care for this issue earns this movie 5 stars.  I gave it four, however, because while it is one of my most beloved portrayals of Christ and the story of his life, there are some parts during the film where the screenplay seems to be lacking.  For example, the revival of Lazarus -- we don't even get to see Lazarus' body, and the people just come down the hill to report that he is alive.  I felt that if they had done a scene where Lazarus came out and was atleast visible, it would have felt more like a miracle.  With deciding not to show his living body, doubt comes upon the viewer since the news that is reported is from those who claimed to see it.  It is kind of funny that I speak of doubt in regards to this film.<br />I'm not an expert on Scripture, however, from reading these other reviews I've picked up that this is one of the most accurate portrayals of Christ's story.  On the issue of whether or not Jesus was a confident Son of God or an indecisive and fearful one (the one portrayed by Dafoe in The Last Temptation of Christ), I would suggest that Sydow's portrayal is probably more accurate.  This is not because it is the more comfortable and comforting choice, but because throughout the history of Christianity, God's appearances through angels, apparitions, voices, signs, and miracles have all been pretty clear and unquestionable.  If you hear God, you will know it...none of that liberal--I'm-trying-to-find-my-calling-from-God-and-I-think-it-is-one-of-the-several-above-choices mumbo jumbo.  In the Catholic tradition, God doesn't mess with our heads.  If He chooses to reveal Himself to us, we will KNOW, and there will be no question about what He wants from us.  The same controversy arises in the Joan of Arc films -- the television series starring Leelee Sobieski, and the Hollywood version, &quot;The Messenger&quot; starring that girl from the 5th Element.  In the tv film, Sobieski portrays a most dignified and confident Joan.  In the Hollywood series, Joan is portrayed as a nutty schizophrenic who is neither coherent or sure of her position and what God wants from her (or if God is even speaking to her at all).  Unfortunately, records can only carry so much content and the rest is left to speculation.  It will have to be judged by the Church's history of consistency with recorded divine interventions from God.<br />After viewing this movie, I grew such a confidence, and also strength, in the living Christ.  It was truly a very Holy and peaceful portrayal.  I recommend this film to anyone curious of what the living Christ might have been like, and those who want to come to know Christ's story, whether Christian or not.recommend this film to anyone curious of what the living Christ might have been like, and those who want to come to know Christ's story, whether Christian or not.
B00005AWMF|3.0|I guess someone put together a \\"best of\\" to showcase her range of talents.<BR>I would have personally selected some better cuts for a \\"best of\\" collection.<BR>What drew me to Sade was her ability to capture eloquently in music and verse the human condition. This collection falls short of my expectation. The number of cuts on the collection that actually do this and contain the quintessential Sade is far too few.<BR>Four or Five songs really speak of her ability to capture nuisance and subtility. Her band as always with their talent carries the songs through. Sade no doubt is a unique talent and this collection doesn't do her justice. If you like the songs in this collection buy it. You can have your favorites on one tape. If you are expecting Sade to move you emotionally over every cut it won't happen. In this collection Sade reaches only so far musically and artistically to your psyche and soul through her own. I was left with the feeling that the journey was only half over and asked myself \\"where's the rest\\" after several listenings. Maybe if it wasn't called the \\"best of\\" I wouldn't have been as disappointed.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is an unique movie. We recently took a group of special kids to see the movie at the theaters. They have been talking about it since.The main characters show their special values and what really counts is inside.I very rarely see a movie more than once but this is a very well thought one in which every time you see it a new perspective comes to your mind.I specially like the donkey and feel that it is an example that we are here to serve not to be served.
B00003CXPD|4.0|My father does not care for movies.  He has his favorites and anything else seems to be a waste of time for him.  Last year, I was telling him how great 'Billy Elliot' was and he poopooed it.  He had read a review, you see, in the paper, from someone who said 'Billy Elliot' was trite and formulaic.  I told him that the reviewer had missed the point.  Not every movie needs to have a sad and depressing ending in order to truly emulate &quot;real life.&quot;  Sometimes, people have managed to triumph over the circumstances of birth, finances, or personal difficulty.  A movie about such a triumph does not make it trite.  Anyway, my mother and father rented the movie one night and they BOTH loved it.  Thought it was great.  They even watched it a second time!  Ha HA!  There you are.  Anyone would like this movie if my father does.<br />The acting is superb, the story works toward its inevitable ending (okay, okay, you do know what is going to happen) in a sweet and endearing way.  The only people who might not like this movie are hardcore cynics.  But then, I am a cynic and I still liked it.
B00005CDNJ|5.0|WOW!! What a treat! I have been a fan of ABBA since 1976 when my parents bought the 45 to &quot;Fernando&quot; and ive been hooked ever since! This is without a doubt the best album in the ABBA catalog. Each and every song is a absolute standout espically the US Top 10 hit &quot;The Winner Takes it All&quot;.Agnetha Faltskog's lead vocals are like liquid silver....you really hear hear the heartbreak she is telling in the lyrics. However the best song on the album belongs to Frida and her &quot;Me and I&quot;. Why this song was never released as a single i'll never know. It is one of the most catchy ABBA songs ever produced. Her vocals really shine. In terms of songwriting, this is ABBA's best. The lyrics and music is of a much more mature nature compared to previous work. Other stand out tracks include Agnetha's lead on &quot;Happy New Year&quot; and Frida's lead on &quot;Andante,Andante&quot; and the beautiful ode to teen love in Paris on &quot;Our Last Summer&quot; Do yourself a favor and go purchase this masterpiece.
B000050XEI|5.0|You know, when I bought this CD, partially based of of Amazon reviewers' recommendations, I was skeptical.  I already have all of Enya's previous albums and I was starting to feel like they were sounding all the same.  I never listen to The Memory of Trees, her album just before this one, in fact.  But A Day Without Rain somehow finds some of the joy that echoed on Watermark.  This is a superb album that brings a lot of what Enya did so well (that is combine excitement, passion, serenity and melancholy), back into her musical picture.

B000002U3P|4.0|The movie was a gritty comedy (well, I found it hilarious, anyway), so of course the soundtrack needs to reflect that with a dark and soul-searing soundtrack.  I like the soundtrack, but I have found that the album swings too much from one song to the next.  There are abrupt mood shifts that don't suit me.  If I am in a loud and rockin' mood and wanting that Iggy Pop sound, then I find I skip half the songs on the album because the rest jar me by being too slow and thoughtful.  'The Matrix' soundtrack must have done a better job of combining different musical styles on a single album because I never get the urge to hit that little &gt;&gt; button.  The 'Trainspotting' CD is still worth owning but be prepared to splice and dice it.

B00004YYDI|4.0|The Professional, in its own right, is a fantastic film. Intriguing characters, superb action sequences, and excellent casting make this movie a classic. The original US release of this film, however, is a far better buy than the &quot;uncut&quot; version. As is the case with so many &quot;uncut&quot; versions of films, the scenes cut out of the original US release of The Professional are best left on the editing room floor. The added scenes both disrupt the flow of the film AND make Leon seem like a borderline pedafile. I don't know if the French have a different definition of 'pedafile' than we do here in the US, but these added scenes really detract from the &quot;cool&quot; of Leon. Buyer beware, if you enjoyed the original.
B00003CXAA|3.0|My wife purchased \\"The Godfather\\" DVD collection for my birthday, and much to my disappointment the fifth disc, the one with all the special features, would not play. Thinking it was defective, we returned the set to the store from which she purchased it. The store replaced the set, but the fifth disc in this collection doesn't play either. I have a Toshiba DVD player that is probably less than two years old and this \\"Godfather\\" DVD brings our DVD collection count to 404 discs, and this is the first disc I have ever had that wouldn't launch from its own menu.<br />Is anyone else experiencing this problem? Please advise if this is a chronic problem and what, if anything, Paramount plans to do about it.<br />Thanks in advance for your response...
0790740443|5.0|Every once in a while (actually, pretty much every time Kurt Russell makes a movie), a movie comes around that sucks so bad that you really have to love it. Soldier is such a movie. From the asinine plot to the cheesey special effects, this movie blows-- but I loved it so much that the first time I watched it, I literally had to watch it twice in a row! I really don't see how anyone could not love this movie, especially since it also stars Garey Busey AND the Commish (who knows his real name?). So despite sucking, this movie comes with very high recommendations. You WILL be entertained!

Many times he is forced to take responsibility and care of his younger brothers when his father is out at the pub and his mother is in bed sick and mourning for her many loses.  <BR>I have gained a new understanding of what it is to not have from this book.  I read in horror as a realized the babies were living on sugar and water because milk was too expensive. I can't imagine having a childhood filled with such struggling and questioning as to wether there would be any clothes and any food at all the next day.  As I read further I realized how brave and determined Frank was.  Many times he could of given up hope, like his father, but he never stopped believing that things would get better.<BR>As well as being a account of the obstacles Frank McCourt faced as a child,  Angela's Ashes is also a touching and somewhat humorous book.

B00004Y62T|5.0|It's interesting to compare director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella's interpretation with the source material, mystery novelist Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel of the same name.  As such we were forced to identify with Highsmith's antihero, all the better to set us up for her ironic and daring \\"resolution.\\"  Minghella has changed the ending, but without changing its spirit.  He has Ripley committing an additional murder while throwing in a character not in the novel, Cate Blanchett's Meredith Logue.  Miss Logue serves two purposes, one, she helps unravel the plot and two, she helps to objectify Tom Ripley's ambivalent sexual nature.<br /><br />The simplistic question, is Ripley homosexual? is not answered in the Highsmith novel.  But, certain scenes aboard ship with the clearly gay Peter Smith-Kingsley, decides that Ripley is indeed gay.  Nonetheless the psychological heart of the story, that of a man who loathes himself so much that he can only love himself by assuming the identity of another man whom he admires, is left intact.  Minghella's script and direction remain true to the spirit and broad form of the novel, while improving on the dramatic quality of the story.  (I don't think most movie audiences would have the patience for Highsmith's more leisurely exposition.)<br /><br />Some other changes by Minghella include making Dickie's passion jazz music instead of painting, and emphasizing the rich boy/poor boy dichotomy (somewhat reminiscent of the chasm in The Great Gatsby) by making Dickie a Princeton grad and Tom a piano-playing kid who had a menial job at the university.  In the book Dickie and Tom actually knew one another before Europe, while Minghella has Tom pretend that Dickie and he had previously met.  Also in the book Marge Sherwood's character is almost stupid.  In the movie she is intelligent and insightful.  Dickie loves her and they are to be married.  In the book she is just a girlfriend.<br /><br />The success of this movie in large part is due to Minghella's ability to translate the novel to the screen, but also because of a very superior cast.  Matt Damon as the murderous Mr. Ripley is creepy and vulnerable and entirely believable.  Jude Law as the rich and spoiled, but likeable Dickie Greenleaf, is outstanding.  He is an actor of charisma and subtlety.  Gwyneth Paltrow does a good job in a somewhat limited role as Marge Sherwood.  Cate Blanchett, whom you may recall from her outstanding work in Elizabeth (1998) is particularly good as the straight-laced and somewhat inhibited Meredith Logue who has designs on Tom Ripley's morally corrupted heart (although she thinks he's Dickie Greenleaf).  She, more than anyone conveys the look and feel of the fifties.  And Phillip Seymour Hoffman, whom I recall from his small part as Lester Bangs, the cynical rock critic in Almost Famous (2000), is superb as Dickie's somewhat boorish friend, Freddie Miles.<br /><br />In some ways this is better than the book.  (And in some ways it isn't, of course.)  Minghella, who brought Michael Ondaatje's difficult novel, The English Patient, to the screen, proves once again that he knows the difference between a novel and a screenplay and how to translate the one into the other without losing the essence of the original.  Incidentally, the spiffy line spoken by James Rebhorn as Dickie's father, Herbert Greenleaf, \\"People say you can't choose your parents, but you know you can't choose your children either,\\" is not in the book (nor in Bartlett's Quotations) and so I presume was penned by Minghella.<br /><br />Another very good movie version of the Highsmith novel is the Hitchcock-like Plein Soleil (\\"Purple Noon\\") released in 1960 from French director Rene Clement.ability to translate the novel to the screen, but also because of a very superior cast.

044651652X|1.0|Forced myself to get through it, only because I hate to leave a book unfinished.  The dialogue was stilted, the characters unbelievable, and I didn't sense the passion.  I was greatly disappointed.  Read like the typical Harlequin Romances I read as a teenager.
078062999X|5.0|I made my 12-year old son watch this 3+ hour video with me, as punishment for some long-since-forgotten misdeed.  Some punishment.  He actually wound up enthralled by the story (helped by it having a surprisingly stellar cast,) and in spite of my having to &quot;translate&quot; a lot of the Shakespeareian dialogue into &quot;English.&quot;<BR>This is the best rendition of this timeless classic that I've yet to see.  Punish your kids with some excellent literature, well-provided in a format they'll relate to.
B000002KCC|5.0|About this time, Neil could do no wrong.  This is definitely one of his best ever - along with Rust Never Sleeps and On the Beach (criminally unavailable on CD).  Favorite songs on this include both versions of the title track as well as Albuquerque, World on a String and Lookout Joe - but they are all great.  It has been called a dark album and it is, but in the end it is uplifting to my spirit every time I listen.  When his voice cracks on Mellow My Mind, it just doesn't get any better.  He has made great music throughout his career but never any better than his mid to late 70's peak.  This is it.
0195073401|5.0|To compare with the other two outstanding,but different in style, Kreps and Varian, this book is on the middle of the two. Kreps is chatter-box but intuitive style. Kreps is very good for anyone who wants the logic of microeconomic theory but may be weak in mathematics. If you want to be a theoryist, the logic is important .Varian is very terse but concisely present the microeconomic theory in mathematical form. It is good for who uses mathematics as a language. That is why MWG is a big book. MWG is great in presentation of intuition and mathematic language. It also provides many proofs of theories in crucial parts of microeconomics. Exercises are ranged from reviewing the idea in each chapter to proving the theory and application. (The solution manual is avilable but for instructor only. Ask your professor!) <br />MWG composes of many major parts. The first is Consumer and Producer Theory. This part well presents mixtures of the intuition and mathematics. The weakness is on the producer theory (chapter 4). Presentation of general idea but lack of a deep considerations. Varian (chapters 1-6) is more rigorous and concise. The consumer theory is great (ranging from choice theory to demands, duality and others)<br />On the next part, Game theory, MWG presents major topics in game theory with variety. Of course, MWG is better than Varian in Game but may be worse than Kreps. I prefer Kreps personally. (Of course, Kreps is great in Game theory). Varian provides only skeleton (I think only ribs and head, no arms and legs). MWG is good for introduction to theory but weak in intuition.<br />On the IO part, MWG and Kreps have done a beautiful job. MWG contains more mathematics and proof but if you want to use Tirole's Theory of IO, you would like to read Kreps because MWG put  the content of Tirole into this part.  Varian is weak in IO part.<br />On the information economics, the complete set is in MWG but intuition is better in Kreps. MGW provides many formal representation.It provides concise content of topics (If you need only the information economics, read Chapter 6 and jump to Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard). Varian is still weak in this part.<br />On the general competitive equilibrium, Kreps is weak here. The complete of GE is MWG. Prof Mas-colell is great in GE and this book provides the beauty of his work. It's impressive to read from MWG. Varian provides concisely but completes in topics. If you have no time, read Varian. But if you want to be an expert in GE, read MWG.<br />For welfare economics, MWG contains the necessary content that is hard to find elsewhere. It is great  to read from this first before jump to other specialized texts. Kreps and Varian lack of this part.<br />From my experience, it might be suffering to read MWG for the first time (because of the math used here).You might need the second book to gain intuition (that is why I compare MWG with Kreps and Varian). But it would yield considerable outcome if you keep this track. You will gain almost every topics in microeconomics.<br />I didn't provide content. I hope you can skim those books in your library. My suggestion is 1) If you want more intuitions (less math or you are weak in math), MWG and Kreps are appropriate. 2) If you want more math (you are strong in mathematical language or have less time), MWG and Varian are appropriate. Anyways I think MWG is the core of Microeconomics theory text. Enjoy Reading...
B00005N9CV|5.0|What an absolute beauty!!  No wonder everyone is raving about Ms Krall.  I'm not a great fan of focal stuff, sorry folks I guess that's just me, but when I heard this album I fell under its spell.  This is sultry romanticism at its best and Canadian born Ms Krall provides us with a magical and heady reminder of a truly wondrous age in jazz.  There aren't many jazz artists, male or female, that can lay claim to that golden seven digit number in sales but Ms Krall carries it off with frightening ease and this alone lends a sense of curiosity to those who have not yet discovered her.  One can only but wonder to what heady heights her talent will carry her.  I loved Steve's review, he surmised it so beautifully ... \\"that deep sensual voice, at once icy cool and warmly intimate\\".  I adored the first track S'Wonderful and also Dancing In The Dark later on in the album.  <br />This album comes highly recommended to all jazz fans and I shall definitely be collecting more of her work.
B00005NRNB|1.0|The worst film I have ever seen.  Absolutely terrible!  You can't care about any of the characters, especially those who are shot within minutes of their first appearance, and the countless explosions and bad one-liners leave you with a headache to beat the band.  After suffering through this dreck, the only thought in your head that is still audible will be, &quot;Why, Harrison, why?&quot;
B00005NZJX|4.0|love the album, per se, but, as the others say, the information is wrong. the Album Description has been fixed, but the track listing is still wrong (in that 19-2000 is the only video included). still a great album, tho (no stars off), and definately one for those &quot;all things rare&quot; collectors out there...
B00005A46U|5.0|If like me, you started your Caravan collection with &quot;In The Land Of Grey And Pink&quot; then backtrack a year to this album it really is good. The remastered version has some never before releases on it and they are indeed excellent! A Day In The Life Of Maurice Haylett is a very addictive song with Dave Sinclair's keyboards sounding truly Caravan.......Richard Coughlan's drumming on this track is also superb and I was hooked after two plays!This album has stood the test of time really well (31 years!) and still sounds fresh and relevant....if only some of todays so called artistes could write and play instruments in such a talented way.....get this album you will love it to bits!

B000050XEI|4.0|Finally after waiting five years Enya has finally returned with all new material. While I am proud of owning this CD I kind of feel a smidgey bit cheated. First off this CD is only 34 and a half miniutes long. It seemed more like a demo tape. I have CD singles that are more than 34 minutes long. She could maybe on her next album compose songs that are an average of five or six minutes long. And a couple of songs are like unfinished demo tapes. Deora Ar Mo Chroi and Silver Inches are probably the most uninspired boring tracks Enya has ever written.<br />That doesn't mean that this album is less than great. It's actually one of my favorite albums of 2000. I ran out and bought it on the day it came out. While I miss the dark and stromy atmosphere of Watermark what Enya has offered is no less than amazing. This album is by far her sunniest and most cheerful album to date.<br />The title track is your typical piano instrumental with some vocals here and there. Wild Child is a beautiful song with plucky strings and a very sunny atmosphere and rhythm. Only Time is like Anywhere Is but much slower. This is from what I guess is her biggest hit since Orinoco Flow from 13 years ago.  This another beautiful song. Tempus Vernum is the winner on ADWR. This song is totally different from the previous songs. It's a very Gothic song with lyrics sung in Latin. This is like a severe thunderstorm. The only complaint is that it's only 2 and a half minutes long. It could have been lengthened to about 5 minutes. Deora Ar Mo Chroi is like the calm after the thunderstorm has passed. Unfortunately I am not very moved by this song. It is one of my least favorites on this album. Floras Secret is a beautiful song about two lovers dancing in a garden of petals in a blue sky. Definately one of my favorites on this album. Fallen Embers is a bueatiful song that sounds a bit like China Roses but not as romantic as that one but nonetheless a nice song. Silver Inches is a short instrumental that could,ve been left off this album. It should have been replaced with Isobella. Isobella is a beautiful haunting song that is only available on the Japanese import version of this album. Silver Inches is probably the most uninspiring song Enya has ever done. Pilgrim on the other hand is a very serene song that I would play when sailing along the river on a warm cloudy evening. One By One is another good song. One of the strongest songs on this album. Lazy Days is a great closer to this album. It sounds a lot like On My Way Home but brighter and more optimistic. It's like the third companion of Orinoco Flow.<br />Overall while this album is flawed this is a great new offering from one of my all-time female singers. My wish though is that she would include Isobella on this album. As I said before it's a beatiful haunting song that would have beat every other song on this album. In fact Enya should stop and compile a CD full of B-Sides and rare songs. There are at least ten of them. It would show an even greater prospective of Enyas amazing talent. Another wish is that maybe her next album could be more electronic sounding like Watermark and at least 55 minutes long.<br />An even cooler thing that could happen is a collaboration between Enya and New Age musician Patrick O'hearn. Just imagine Enyas haunting vocals combined with O'hearns soaring ambient electronic synthesizers. It would be the best New Age album ever. I can smell it in the air.<br />But even though that may not happen Enya will remain one of my top five favorite divas of all time. Go and buy this album. While I mostly recommend it to veteran fans it would be a great introduction to new fans as well.<br />Well that's all folks.... He! He!,ve been left off this album.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator would have to be one of the best movies ever made. The storyline and battle scenes are wonderful and the acting is stunning. Russell Crowe delivers an amazing performance as well as the handsome Joaquin Phoenix. A really good hero/villain duo. If you're ever looking for a good war/drama movie, this would have to be it. Buy it. YOU WILL BE ENTERTAINED.
0783226160|5.0|June 1, 1978 was the date Universal Studios released a huge hit, National Lampoon's Animal House.  The running time on this film is 109 minutes, in color, and worth every single minute.  There are several actors and actresses that starred in this film, familiar faces and up and coming stars.  Just to name a few, Animal House included such names as John Belushi as John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky, Tim Matheson as Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratton, Kevin Bacon as Chip Diller and Donald Sutherland as \\"Professor Dave Jennings\\".<BR> Animal House is based on the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity at Dartmouth.  It was to be filmed at the University of Missouri, but was filmed at the University of Oregon after the president of MU read the script and refused permission.  The movie is set in the 1960's on the college campus of Faber and centers around the Delta fraternity house and their rivalry with Omega fraternity.  The two houses play pranks back and forth on each other and the Omega fraternity, along with Faber College, have one goal in mind: to get the Delta fraternity kicked off campus.<BR> A five star rating is what Animal House receives on this review due to the comedy involved and the parody about college life in fraternities.  Most fraternities may not behave, these days, in such a manner as the Deltas, but the rivalry between fraternities is as true as the one between the Deltas and Omegas.  Animal House does not require much thought and analysis to watch and understand, but it is as entertaining as they get!
B00003CX5P|4.0|One doesn't get far into the maze of extras on &quot;Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace&quot; before figuring out that George Lucas and his co-workers made this DVD as much for themselves as their audience. Lucas' glee is evident as he introduces a handful of deleted scenes, all completed at significant expense for the DVD edition. The missing footage is, of course, every bit as good as what remained. But the real treasure here is the insiders documentary &quot;The Beginning: Making Episode I.&quot; Director Jon Shenk had all-areas access to the production process, including casting, rehearsals, set and model building, filming and post-production. On disc, &quot;The Phantom Menace's&quot; CGI effects seem more focused and believable, with fewer blue-screen disconnects. The small-screen treatment somehow seems to amplify the movie's appeal to children. The thrilling Jedi knights martial arts scenes, however, lose much of their impact compared with the theatrical presentation. Colors are vibrant and stable, with deep-space blacks, dazzling whites and nary a speck or a sign of wear. The Dolby Digital 5.1 EX mix keeps all speakers jumping, especially the subwoofer. Rear sound effects are active and more playful than on most discs, but still tend toward the predictable. The lack of DTS option will disappoint many audiophiles. (Other downbeat note: There is no option to mute Jar Jar Blinks.) Lucas and some of his key collaborators provide a commentary track that's heavy on effects and light on humans. Easter eggs yield a blooper reel, deleted scenes from the deleted scenes docu (!) and a few outtakes. All in all, an essential for &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans.
0446608955|4.0|It was of pure chance I picked this book from the library - and this bittersweet romance charmed me off effortlessly with its simple storytelling. This book opens unabashedly with the character's confession, &quot;First you will laugh - later you will cry.&quot; Nicholas Sparks draws the reader to the town of Beaufort and spins a yarn about Lancer Carter, who at the age of seventeen learns about the true love and miracles of God through his fateful encounter with the local minister's daughter Jamie Sullivan. He is intrigued by how gregarious and cheerful she remains, and together in a drama play - he learns of Jamie's down-to-earth character and how strong she is despite her tragedy. <br />Again Nicholas Sparks's poignant writing shines here - A Walk to Remember drips with nostalgia with a small town background and Lancer's revelation. It is tinged with a melancholy that is cloyingly tender and the final script presents a love that is ironically eternal yet so transient. It may not have the passionate intensity of Message in a Bottle and The Notebook but simplicity can sometimes be a charmer as in the case of A Walk to Remember.

There's lots of good stuff here and although &quot;Deja Voodoo&quot; remains my favorite song from the album (make sure to always listen to the full-length version on the album, not a butchered radio version), &quot;Born with a Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;One Foot on the Path&quot;, &quot;I'm Leaving You (Commit a Crime)&quot;, and &quot;What's Goin' Down&quot; are all first rate. &quot;While We Cry&quot; is a live cut and &quot;Riverside&quot; is the only song with Kenny Wayne himself on lead vocals. It's a diversified, solid album from a musician who's only getting better and better.

B00000099Y|5.0|you never know how much you're going to apreciate a band until you see them live. i had the pleasure of attending one of their schedualed dates in San Antonio TX. the CD does not even begin to compare to what this rock quartet is capable of.
B0000017CA|5.0|this might be one of the most underrated and brilliant cd's ever written. it is a incredibly cohesive and atmospheric. few other bands have ever managed to put up such a dense, dark and disturbing atmosphere. every song is unique in it's way still does every song radiate pain, loss, anger and violence. violence most of all. still the lyrics are masterfully written and they never drift of in death-metal-cannibal-corpse-splatter stupidity. dax riggs is a genious in both ways, he signs/screams very well, also he writes brilliant, partly poetic partly just angered, lyrics. the complete band is very talented, the two guitarists play very diverse from grindcore attacks (&quot;jezebel&quot;) to very groove-laden riffs (&quot;tranquilized&quot;). the bassist audie pitre (R.I.P.) is also highly talented so is the drummer. the opener &quot;the blue&quot; is a relatively mellow song for an opener, but it is one hell of a song anyway. grinding away at mid-tempo with dax screaming stuff like &quot;fragments of a sunbeam glaring on this kitchen knife&quot; it is poeticly violent. other standout tracks are &quot;cheap vodka&quot;, a fast paced, furious 2 minute kick in the face, &quot;jezebel&quot;, which starts out with a brutal grindcore-massacre, also a lyrically violent and very twisted song (&quot;if i took the cigarette and put it out on you...would you love me?&quot; or &quot;she screams bloody murder as they chop off her fingers so this is how it feels to die but it's okay... everything's okay&quot;), &quot;screams of the butterfly&quot;, a very mellow acoustic track with beautiful poetic, yet violent lyrics and &quot;what color is death&quot;, a disturbing mosh-pit type of metal song. altogether every song is worth mentioning because nothing sounds same on this album. this album should be owned by every metal fan. a must-have.
B00003CXSP|3.0|which took a little of the edge off this movie in my eyes. There is only ONE Hannibal Lechter and thats Anthony Hopkins and there is only one Clarice and of course that's Jodie F. OKOK so I'm one of the dinasours that believes that theres only ONE James Bond and that is Sean Connery ...... <br />Julianne Moore does an acceptabble job but she just seems to have that hardened edge of a street wise late 30's New York kind of woman. Jodie Foster, does not, she always looks counrty no matter how many guns she has in her hands..... Along the lines of mis-casting, I thought that Ray Liotta, as Clarices scheming miserable back stabbing boss, was poop.... he never convinced me as an FBI type that's for sure... <br />The DVD is fabulous and, in most respect, true to the book. Matter of fact I preferred the movie since the ending was left wide open as compared to the book that had what I really considered was a completly shocking surprise ending. <br />The movie also left out Mason Verger's sister almost completely ... HMMMM wonder why ... I thought she added a little intrigue to the show .... and well we won't talk about Vergers Micheal Jackson type of obsession for playing games with kids that were also omitted in the movie..... <br />On a happy note, the pigs astounding and if they have an academy award for animals then these 550 pound beauties get my vote thats for sure .... <br />I don't know if I would buy the movie with two major miscasts, but if you love Anthony Hokins slurping his toung while munching on fava beans the run to the store and get the DVD now .....
0064407667|5.0|Only Lemony Snicket could of wrote this book. If you read the first page you just can't stap reading it. Also if you read THE BAD BEGINNING you have to read the rest of the series. Lemony Snicket is BY FAR the best author the world has ever seen.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I know that this Star Wars has received some mixed reviews from the die hard fans that have PHd's in Star Warology, but, as far as I'm concerned, a mere wookie mortal living in Ft Lauderdale, this is one great DVD ..... <br />As far as I'm concerned I think Jar Jar Binks absolutely rules and it's one of the greatest characters ever to come out of the mind of Lucas, right afer Joda ..... <br />For those of you that have surround sound at home with a wide screen television, the technical production of this movie will let you put those amps and speakers through their paces ..... The movie is cut in an anamorphic widescreen ration of 2.35:1 which for the uninitiated means your wife won't be sitting beside you complaining that everyone in the movie is too fat ....  <br />What can you say when video, sound and special effects are perfect ...... hands down one of the best DVD's around today .....
B00003CXE7|4.0|The info sais it's DTS but that's not the whole truth. It is one of the few titles currently that have it's audio encoded as DTS-ES 6.1 Discrete Surround which means 7 separate channels giving you the best possible audial experience.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|I just kept my video on while doing some desk chores beside the television, when I found myself coming to be involved in the movie on the screen. I put my deskwork aside and began seriously watching the very beautiful portrayal of things English of some 200 years ago. <BR>The heroine, played by Amanda Root, didn't appear so attractive in the beginning. I found her rather homely at first. By and by, however, she began to look attractive and even beautiful as the picture evolved. <BR>It is indeed as excellent a period picture as Sense and Sensibility of 1996.
B00003CY0V|4.0|So you have this very noble idea, eliminating terrorism from the world, but how far would you go? Gabriel (John Travolta) is part of a secret organization to stop terrorism, but he needs more funding. He seeks out a retired computer hacker named Stanley (Hugh Jackman) to crack several mainframes and databases transferring over 4 billion dollars into their account. Stanley, who is in the middle of a dirty custody battle for his daughter (which is brought up at least once every fifteen minutes. Everyone from the FBI to Halle Berry wants to save this kid from her mother and porn-directing stepfather), was recently arrested for hacking by the FBI. If he touches a computer, will be sent to jail... <br />This movie references several cinematic masterpieces such as &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Sugarland Express.&quot; What I found most interesting about the plot is that it borrows so much from these movies, while still being considered original. You almost get the feeling as the bus drives off to the airport; you know what will happen. But just as Gabriel says, &quot;Oh, come on, Stan. Not everything ends the way you think it should. Besides, audiences love happy endings.&quot;<br />This movie was just the right length, had just the right actors, but had too much computer jargon for the regular person to understand. While some may know what a &quot;worm&quot; is, others will be stumped as they (Travolta and Jackman) exchange ideas on 1,064 bit encryption and backdoors. The writers of the movie understood what they wrote, but my girl-friend still a little confused on some of the topics. <br />Overall, I enjoyed this film immensely. Much better than Battlefield Earth, I assure you!
0064471837|5.0|This book is purely magical and very hard to put down! The plot is unique and the story a fabulous new classic.<br />Its about a girl, Sabriel who's father is a Abhorsen, (necromancers) captured in death. Unlike other necromancers, who plays with dead and brings them back to life, the Abhorsen keeps the dead . . .well dead. Because Sabriel has the bloodlines of the ancient Abhorsen genes she also had the abilities to put the dead to rest (like her father) and she now uses her special abilities to save her father from death. To do this, she must cross over the &quot;Old Kingdom&quot; which is now no longer in peace. The dead is stirring and the young girl must do everything to save destruction for she is the Abhorsen, the greatest Mage of all, its her duty to bind things in place.<br />The story is truely awesome and I found Sabriel ability to sense death in any form, whether its leaving a body or coming back as evil, very detailed in feelings and adds a touch of &quot;realness&quot; to the character.<br />Our whole class is currently reading Garth Nix's books, Sabriel and Shade's Children.<br />I will deffiantly be following up on his other books!=)
B000001ZS3|5.0|Oxygene has been with me most of my life. My dad owned this album when I was a kid, but that LP disappeared in his collection in 1986, but in 1991 I bought me an LP of this to relive the nostalgia, and my attitude hadn't changed one bit of this album, and I can still say that to this day. Jean Michel Jarre was responsible to making electronic music more acceptible to the mass audience, as much as I love a lot of the works of Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream's earlier works, there were a lot of people turned off by their works, since their music was not as accessible. Oxygene, contrary to popular beliefs, is not Jarre's debut album. His first full album release was Deserted Palace in 1972, and he released a few singles before then, like &quot;La Cage&quot; in 1970. I hadn't heard these, as they aren't exactly easy to come by (I never seen them around). It was Oxygene that made Jarre a household name in electronic music, and is a truly stunning masterpiece in this genre. Very spacy, lots of lush string synths, with a strong emphasis on melodies, making it more pop-oriented than the likes of earlier Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, etc. It's basically a continuous play divided in to six parts. I only have one complaint of this album and that was the first half of &quot;Oxygene V&quot;, because it sounds exactly like funeral music and I find it rather difficult to listen to, but the rest of the album is nothing short of amazing. It's too bad that Oxygene set a bad example of what electronic music would later be in the 1980s and 1990s, but that never stopped me from enjoying this album. Jarre might be a big figure in Europe with many albums hitting Top 10 over there, but in America, he's basically confined to a small, loyal following, basically, the same people who enjoy the likes of Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Tomita, etc. Every time I listen to Oxygene, it gives much such fond memories. It's a no brainer, this album is an absolute must for all electroniclovers out there, so be sure to get a copy.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Leonard Cohen's prior release, 1992's \\"The Future\\", is one of my favorite albums, so I had extremely high expectations for this. I was not disappointed. The lyrics resonate with new simplicity and clarity. It is as if Cohen stripped away everything hindering communication between him and us. The music, too, has turned inward. Long-time collaborator Sharon Robinson's arrangements are sparse, leaving plenty of room for the words to breathe. The synth-drenched songs give an extreme intimacy, as they are rarely more than undercurrents for voice. Some are reminiscent of spoken word poetry with light baroque music in the background. This fits the songs in its way, but I will be the first to say that a lot of the electronic percussion is rather annoying at times. There are occasional beats and things that simply do not belong on a Cohen album, but it works well for the most part. It's certainly different than before but in a way gives the words even more prominence than they have always had. It can be a bit of surprise at first, as the album starts with electronic ambiance and percussion, Robinson's voice, and, finally, the grave, grave voice of Cohen himself, deeper than ever. This is Cohen's most solipsistic album. As always with him, all tracks are beyond worthwhile, and there are some truly great ones. The opening \\"In My Secret Life\\" is an instant classic; \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\" is a profound tonal poem; \\"Alexandra Leaving\\" is perhaps the standout, a brooding masterpiece on which Robinson's voice works wonders along with Cohen's; and closing track \\"The Land of Plenty\\" is near-spiritual, a truly immaculate song. Fans will truly appreciate this album. It is another great work, another incredible addition to his ouvere, which might indeed be called The Land of Plenty.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is the best movie ever made. It is awesome on VHS and even better on the DVD. I am telling you this is it. The one awesome movie that tops all others. If you like twisted humor and british comedians like Terry Jones and terry Gillam this is PERFECT FOR U!
B000002B7O|5.0|Yes: 'Blizzard Of Ozz' is a masterpiece and it's place in hard-rock/metal history is deserving,not to mention,secured... But 'Diary Of A Madman' is 1.)musically ; 2.)instrumentally and 3.)songwise/production-wise The Better Album,and THAT'S saying a hell of a lot. Randy's playing,his songwriting and his overall vision upon his chosen instrument of guitar is nothing short of sublime and stupendous. Randy goes one beyond the generally-hard-rock of 'Blizzard' and ADDS amazing,graceful doses of classical guitar and arrangements that boost these songs and performances to a timeless level. 'Diary' is equal parts classic,hard-rock Ozzy songs (\\"Flying High Again\\",\\"Over The Mountain\\") and also truly-gorgeous-yet-heavy songs such as \\"You Can't Kill Rock And Roll\\",\\"Tonight\\" & \\"Diary Of A Madman\\",where the classical-influence is driven to the fore. This album is the more satisfying album of the two Ozzy studio albums recorded with Randy Rhoads. Also,this album SOUNDS better than 'Blizzard Of Ozz'. Randy's tone and all his nuances are SHINING compared to 'Blizzard'. Anyone who says this album sucks or isn't one of Ozzy's best albums is : 1.)on crack or many hits of acid.. or 2.)Truly ignorant of Ozzy's music and his career. If you're a fan of an album such as 'No More Tears'(1991) and are interesting in digging back to earliest Ozzy,then 'Diary Of A Madman' should be bought even before-or alongside-'Blizzard Of Ozz'. Then,get the 'Trubute' album. Even so,biased as I am,'Diary Of A Madman' remains Ozzy's best solo album ever.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has evolved.  That's a fact.  Their previous albums were great, but this is awesome.  They are definately are not concerned with radio hits, or pleasing the part of their fan base who only enjoys the heavy sections.  These are the kids at school who say, &quot;Dude, Lateralus is cool, but it doesn't rock as hard as Aenima!&quot;  <br />They now appeal even more to an intelligent group of people.  Much like albums by Radiohead, some Pink Floyd, and other experimental groups, Lateralus did not instantly make sense to me.  It was obviously much more &quot;progressive&quot; in nature.  But I didn't hear what the point of it all was, musically.  Like usual, it eventually all came together.  This is the entire purpose of music.  It makes me feel things I've never felt and think of things I've never thought of.  Being an apathetic musician, I usually don't take much interest in the lyrics.  But they are another strong point on Lateralus.  Tool isn't trying to scare us, make us respect them, make us revolt, convert our religion, or lack there of.  But they do offer real thoughts and feelings.  We can do with them what we please.  Other bands have let me down recently by choosing not to progress with their new albums (System Of A Down).  But Tool definately did grow, and I cannot wait to see what's next.  But first we get a new A Perfect Circle album.  Sweet Revelation.
0452273331|5.0|Amazing, how a book written so long ago can be written about some people today. It is as if some people on one side of the political spectrum seem to follow the book. Besides philosphy, this is good reading for a story in itself. Long book, and the characters become a part of your life.
B00001OH7P|5.0|AWWW YEAH.  Although this is a commercial success (why wouldn't it be), Bowie has again shown the world that he has a certain genius quality.  This is always a great concept album to listen to.  There are so many moods on this one disc.  It represents the &quot;chameleon&quot; of Bowie.  It is ever changing like himself.  I would recommend this to any person who enjoys good Rock-N-Roll.  It also makes a Great gift.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Legally Blonde was the funniest film of the year without a doubt and proved to the world that Reese Witherspoon is one of the funniest and best actresses in Hollywood. She gives a star making performance as Elle Woods a rich princess who attends Harvard to win her boyfriend back. She of course takes the school by storm and ends up proving to everyone and herself that she can do whatver she wants. Stupid plot..yes it is...but Reese and the entire cast pull it off flawlessly giving us an entertaining, funny, sweet, and touching film that will leave you smiling and cheering at the end.
B00001OH7N|5.0|Width of a Circle is one of the best songs on the album.  I like the way it feedbacks into your brain.  His most inspiring work for me.  It is always a great cd to listen to, no matter what the mood is.  I have a version that contains bonus tracks.  One of them being HOLY HOLY.  That song is incredible.  This disc is a must have.
0399143904|1.0|I'm a fan of Clancy's early efforts but stopped reading after the Debt of Honor fiasco.  I sympathize with the author in that the end of the cold war has led to a dearth of good material.  However, Clancy doesn't need my sympathy in that plenty of people who read Red October and loved it, keep buying these stupid books (like me).  Put it this way, when you start to suspect that this is going to be the worst novel you have ever read, stop reading.  You'll be doing yourself a favor because I can promise you that your suspicions are correct.
6301967992|5.0|Das war der erste Horrorfilm, den ich als Kind im Kino sah. Im Gegensatz zu &quot;Tot aber glücklich&quot; mit Leslie Nielsen ist &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot; eher ein Gruselfilm als eine Komödie, wenn auch viele Szenen zum Lachen sind. Gute Szenen:<br />- Schon zu Anfang im Vorspann sieht man Bluttropfen auf psychedelischer Blauer Schrift zu unheimlicher Jazzmusik.<BR>- Die erste Szene mit dem eingefrorenen Professor im Gasthaus, wo er wieder aufgetaut werden soll.<BR>- Die Rolle Sharon Tates: Sie sieht durch ein Fenster auf Polanski, der einen Schneemann baut.<BR>- Die Ehefrau des Wirtes beobachtet ihren Mann, wie er durch das Schlüsselloch die junge Sarah beobachtet, sie will ihm mit einer dicken Salamiwurst eine verpassen und haut aber versehentlich dem alten Professor eins über den Kopf.<BR>- Roman Polanski spielt etwas vertrottelt und schüchtern den Assistenten des Professors. Sympathisch und zurückhaltend.<BR>- Der Diener des Vampirschlosses soll in Wirklichkeit auch so aussehen und ist wirklich zum Fürchten, besonders die Verfolgungsszene, wo Polanski sich auf der Kutsche versteckt um in das Schloss zu kommen.<BR>- Die beiden Spione und Vampirjäger werden in dem Schloss vom Grafen Krolock entdeckt und geben vor, nach Fledermäusen wissenschaftlich zu suchen. Der Graf sagt skeptisch das es im Winter doch gar keine Fledermäuse gibt, ...<BR>- Der homoerotische Sohn des Grafen will sich in Alfreds Hals verbeißen und beißt in ein Buch. Eine nächtliche Verfolgungsjagd durch das Schloss beginnt.<BR>- Das Schloss im Winter und Schnee und die Landschaft der Wälder und Berge sind gut gewählt und ähnlich beeindruckend wie &quot;Nosferatu&quot; von Friedrich Murnau.<BR>- Der Graf der Vampire zeigt majestätisch in rotem Mantel sein Reich und weist auf die Landschaften und das verschneite Schloss. Dabei steigen im Hof (gruselig, obwohl Komödie) die Toten aus den Gräbern um sich für den Ball vorzubereiten.<BR>- Seltsame Begegnung von wirklichen Eheleuten: Polanski trifft Sharon Tate wieder. Per Zufall im Vampirschloss und einer Badewanne. Man weiß nicht, ob sie noch normal ist oder schon ein Vampir geworden ist und lügt. Sie spricht vieldeutige Worte aus.<BR>- Der Ball selbst ist eine tolle Idee von Polanski: Am Schluss sieht man das Spiegelbild der drei und sie sind enttarnt. Eine wilde Flucht im Schloss beginnt.<BR>- Warum allerdings am Schluss doch kein Happy End kommt (Sharon Tate ist ein Vampir geworden) ist genauso seltsam als der Schluss von &quot;Rosemaries Baby&quot; wo im Gegensatz zum Buch auch ein &quot;Nicht-Happy-End&quot; vom Regisseur gewählt wurde.<br />- Mit &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1925 und 1980), &quot;Interview mit einem Vampir&quot;,  &quot;Vampyr&quot; (1931, etwas schwerverständlich, aber zum Fürchten) und evtl noch &quot;Dracula&quot; von 1995 einer der wenigen Vampirfilme, die meiner Ansicht Klassiker sind und in jede Videosammlung gehören. Warum 1967 der Film kein Erfolg wurde ist komisch, jetzt gibt es sogar ein erfolgreiches Musical &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot;.
6304712936|5.0|What can one do to sum this movie up in words? There are few films that equal the power of Amadeus in the entire history of cinema, and i dare type that this film is one of the * GREATEST * American films ever made. That's a big boast, i know, but i am more than convinced that is the truth. I remember seeing Amadeus several times in my early childhood { 6 - 8 years old }, and i remember how much of an effect it had on me back then, but of course i was only an impressionable child, right? Well, i finally did purchase this DVD several months ago { Half-heartedly }, and i wasn't immediately impressed with it. I suppose that's the result of nolonger being innocent. ^_^ However, as time has gone by, and as I've watched this movie over and over again, Amadeus has nestled its way into my very being; just the thought of this film's soundtrack { Definitely the best rendition of Mozart available } brings me to tears; not a time goes by that that i don't watch this film and cry, almost uncontrollably. Everything that you've heard is true - the actors, sets, dialogue and direction of this film are simply stunning, but it is the music that will pierce you. If you aren't fond of Classical, buy this movie and revel within the intoxicating genius that is Mozart. You will never hear music the same way again... that is a promise.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I just watched the Episode I DVD with the commentary feature on and got some insight as to what might be wrong with the Phantom Menace.  When George Lucas made the original movies in the late 70's/early 80's, he was a serious filmmaker. He approached movie making the same way someone like Francis Ford Coppola or other serious directors did. The only difference was that the subject matter of Lucas' films(outer space adventures) was usually the fare of lousy B movies. In the DVD, Lucas continually reminds of special effects shots that were impossible to do in the originals. It seems almost as if these technological constraints forced Lucas to focus on such things as plot, character development and witty, sharp dialogue.During the commentary,one of the F/X guys chimed in about how much CG scenery was packed into each frame. Maybe thats the problem. In the originals, the focus was narrowed on the characters.  We got a real sense of who Han Solo and Luke Skywalker were and what they were about. In the Phantom Menace, they were so concerned about making fake things look real they forgot what was really important to movie fans.  It really makes you realize how long ago it was since the original trilogy came out.  I almost wish Lucas didn't wait 16 years to make this movie. If he waited maybe 5 or 10 years, we may have seen the REAL episode I.
B000002KY8|4.0|One of the fine Prince albums in the 80s, with the other two Purple Rain and Sign of the Times&quot;, showcases his talent and his quality as a superstar. Though durable until today, it sets an initial stage for the forthcoming great album Purple Rain and the maturity of Sign of the Times and his other albums in the 90s. So I rate the album four stars.
B000002UAU|5.0|This album has some of the best Beatles songs.  &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends,&quot; &quot;Lonely Rita,&quot; and &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; are some great songs.  I listen to this CD a lot, but it is certainly not as good as the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds.  You really need to check out Pet Sounds.
B000002L68|5.0|The best Prince album in the 80s, not because of the phenomenal success brought about by the film, but just on account of its quality.  All songs on this album are great.  Who could forget the classic Let's Go Crazy, Take Me with U, The Beautiful Ones, Computer Blue, Darling Nikki, When Doves Dry, I Would Die 4 U, Baby I'm a Star and, of course, Purple Rain?  It is also one of the best albums in the 80s and in the history of pop music, together with Michael Jackson's Thriller and Madonna's Like a Virgin.  Very Great.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is a beautiful and very rich-sounding soundtrack, very reminiscent of Star Wars and Indiana Jones. And as much as I like what they did with it, I'm also very greatful for what they *didn't* do with it. They didn't put a bunch of stuff in to try and appeal to kids. And they didn't get some rockstar or teen pop idol to sing a song about Harry Potter that would be on the radio constantly for months, in order to get more attention and sell the CD. (the rumors about Celine Dion singing &quot;The Boy Who Lived&quot; were giving me nightmares.) THANK YOU for this amazing and wonderful soundtrack! Hedwig's Theme is simply incredible. I can't wait to see this movie.
B000002E5J|5.0|Every morning I hum Estoy Aqui as I sashay to my car and then I turn one of the local latin radio stations and try to catch her<BR>new release &quot;suerte&quot;.  Occasionally I get lucky.  If I don't, I can sometimes find &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; on a pop radio station.<BR>She has written intelligent lyrics and the music to go with it; her videos are intriguing; I enjoy her music more than any other artist and I have a vast catalogue of pop, rock, salsa, xydeco,<BR>dixieland jazz, alternative, blues, vallenatos, and on and on.  My taste is vast yet specific.  I can't think of a more talented artist who is reaching all audiences at this time.  &quot;Moscas en la casa&quot;  is so provocative and &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; makes you crazy to dance; both are from Donde Estan Los Ladrones.  Make the effort to get at least one of her CDs; you won't be sorry.  You'll be back for more.  A special thank you to Shakira Isabel Mubarek and her parents for their support of her.  What happiness you have brought to my world.  May peace come to the people of Colombia.
079073463X|5.0|I loved this movie as a child and love it even more now because I'm grown and can understand what it's about. I think the 80s was one of the greatest movie decades ever. Ladyhawke had a captivating, but easy to follow plot. The soundtrack is a little unusual (rock and roll setting in medieval story), but Ladyhawke pulls it off. Really it just adds to the charm, cause they don't do movies like this anymore in the new century. So it's kind of an escape back to childhood for me.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I literally cannot imagine an album more worth buying.  Before listening to When the Pawn... and then eventually Tidal, I only knew Fiona Apple as a one hit wonder who struck it big on selling her sex in the Criminal video.  Mistaken I was, seeing that When the Pawn... is the album I've been waiting for all this time.  Musically, it works because no artist in the 90's has produced music so highly original and textured and somewhat weird.  Lyrically, the straightforward poetry combined with Fiona's likable voice create a stimulating conversation between the listener and the artist.  I can't describe the sheer pleasure of listening to this album.  It's as intimate and pleasurable as talking to an old friend on the phone, knowing that there's still so much time before you have to get off.
B000003TAW|5.0|This has to be one of the catchiest Cd's I own.  I bought it way back in fourth grade when &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and &quot;Undone (The sweater song)&quot;  were all over the radio.  I still pop in this cd every couple months, cause it never get's old.  Songs like &quot;No one else&quot; and &quot;Say it ain't so&quot; show the lead singer, Rivers Cuomo's charismatic voice.  I love in &quot;No one else&quot; the &quot;Watch her watch her watch her watch her! (sounds like &quot;wouldja?&quot;)  Could anyone not sing along with that song?  It makes seemingly cool people go nerd, and it rocks all the way.  Latas
0060392886|5.0|What an AWESOME book! Believe me when I say that you won't be able to put this one down... Impossible. I knew I had to read &quot;this&quot; book after seeing their VH1 special. I've laughed out loud a bunch of times while reading about their lewd descriptions, rememberances of previous events, day to day existance with one another &amp; just being a rough &amp; rowdy band. It's one of those books that you wish would go on and on and on... Check it out - TRUST ME, YOU'LL LOVE IT! <BR>    CAUTION: NOT FOR THE MEEK AND MILD AND TENDER HEARTED.
B00005QG9J|1.0|I bought this CD because I was very impressed with their previous realease, &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. They have such a wide variety of musical styles, but personally I liked their stong, hard rock-oriented sound which was evident in most of their songs. Whilst I appreciate the skill of writing slower, acoustic tracks such as &quot;Drive&quot;, it's not their best work in my opinion. This latest offering from Incubus is far too mellow, rather boring and generally a huge disappointment. I'm not going to point the finger in the direction of sellout, nor am I going to call it more mature. I think only the band knows why they have followed the path that they have, and that's their choice. Honestly though, I didn't buy this CD to hear mellow crap. I bought it because I liked their previous style. Thumbs down on this one.
B00004SVID|5.0|OK, so you think you know Pink Floyd? So you think you know &quot;The Wall&quot;? So you should buy this.<br />For now let's ignore the packaging which, while incredible, gives only tiny samples of what the show actually looked like. If the video footage exists it should be released.<br />Let's concentrate on the music. By now everybody should know the history of &quot;The Wall&quot;. Spawned from Roger Waters' hatred of arena rock and the spitting incident in Canada during the &quot;Animals&quot; tour, this album became as much of a milestone as &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;. Waters attempted this live, but the motley collection of celebrity guest stars never quite caught it. The problem was that, as much as Roger insists that &quot;he&quot; was Pink Floyd, the guitar sound of David Gilmour was just as big a part of the overall band sound. And this is highlighted on this album. Hailed by Gilmour himself as the best song he ever wrote, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is the showcase. The studio version of the solo was incredible. This version is totally awesome. I can't even begin to imagine him playing this, bathed in the glare of a spotlight, standing on top of &quot;The Wall&quot;.<br />The venom of some of Roger's lyrics is way more apparent live, and the original sting of the playing and performance is heightened in the live setting. That the band were actually falling apart at the time due to the old favorite &quot;musical and personal differences&quot; makes the fact that this album is so good a testimony to the undoubted talents of Messrs Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright.<br />OK, there isn't too much that's different to the studio version. The inclusion of &quot;The Last Brick In The Wall&quot; is the only major variation, although some tracks include all of the lyrics which were originally printed on the sleeve of the studio album.<br />What makes this an incredibly satisfying album is knowing that the band could carry the whole thing off on stage in what must have been an awe-inspiring sight. That David Gilmour's reformed Pink Floyd have reintroduced the entire &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; live is a testimony to the &quot;concept&quot; album. Believe it or not they did work, even though they were condemned and pilloried by most prog-rock critics.<br />As a parting thought. How many bands around today could release a live album 20 years after it was recorded and still sell??<br />Go Floyd.
034537410X|5.0|I searched for well over a month looking for a book or a magazine with any decent psychological information on lucid dreaming, I came up with nothing until I bought this book.  It's wonderful!  The authurs write so that the average person can read it and they have many different useful exercises to induce lucid dreaming.  I found it so interesting I couldn't put the book down to even write notes!  If you need a book on lucid dreaming this is the one.
B00000ILDE|2.0|The movie of Aliens on this DVD is really nice. The extra 17 minutes of footage fill in pieces of the plot and make the movie have a better more rounded plot. Almost worth the DVD itself.<br />However, I said almost... <br />There are no good extra's on this DVD. No directors commentary, in fact, there are no commentaries at all on this DVD!<BR> <BR>What extra's there are on this DVD are pathetic; Some short home footage of the model of the Base and Atmosphere Processor on LV-426, and how the Face Hugger, and Chest Burster mechanics work and a concept of the Alien Queen. There are also some stills from the movie and that's about it. I expected a whole lot more.<br />As a movie, I would rate the 5 out of 5, but as a DVD, only 2 out of 5.<br />Mr. James Cameron can make some really good movies, but his DVD's really stink in comparison to what other directors put on their DVD's.<br />If your a hardcore Aliens fan, get this, other than that, spend your money on the Gladiator DVD since it is a much better DVD.
B00000F169|1.0|After reading the reviews, I thought I'd give this one a try.  I shouldn't have.  What I should have done was paid more attention to the reviews that stated that this film isn't for everyone.  I would have saved myself some money.<br />It looks like a low-budget (which I guess it is), amateurish film -- along the lines of the Blair Witch Project, which I didn't care for either.  But heck, I liked that better than this.  And yes, I realize they're two totally different genres.<br />It's like watching a home made movie that maybe your uncle made while following someone around with his camcorder.<br />I will admit that a few scenes made me smile simply because they made me think of the fun the actors and directors must have had making such a campy film.  But with that said, I expected more than what I got so I didn't care for it. Heck, I didn't even finish it.  But to its credit, it solved my insomnia at least for one night.
B00005ATQD|2.0|There are three major problems with this movie. First: It is edited to move very slowly. The story could have been told in a third less time. Second: The story was not involving enough because the characters were poorly defined and not very sympathetic, especially Nicole Kidman's character. Third: If characters have longings and desire, let us see them, don't tell us about them. She does slow dance with an older man at a party, but not for a minute do we see her desire for sex with this man. She was too busy playing drunk and he was too disgusting for us to believe that she was attracted to him. He almost represnted her inner thoughts, the evil temptation that she is supposed to be struggling with, but it just doesn't work. Yes, he was disgusting and in a way, the truth of her desire to have sex with other men is equally disgusting, but the average viewer is just not going to get it. Too symbolic. Kidman has a scene where she tells her husband of a sex dream that she has. We see her naked while changing clothes in the movie, but we see no real personal evidence of her inner struggle to be faithful to just one man and just one life, forever. Her fear of commitment comes out in words only and not her deeds. Tom Cruise is supposed to be a rational intellectual, a stretch for him, and his character over reactes to his wifes confession of having a brief obsession with a man she saw once in a hotel lobby while on vacation. This is the catalyst for Cruise to run to a prostitute on the street, but a phone call from the wife saves him from the nasty deed. Then, he sneaks into a strange ritualistic sex party, the consequences of which turn out to be a bunch of red herrings. I believe that Tom Cruise was mis-cast in this movie. The acting was labored and slow for all of the actors but I believed his character the least. Tom Cruise as an intellectual doesn't fly. I found myslef being upset that I had waisted my time watching this painfully slow movie. The movie could have improved immensly with tight editing, more severe consequenses for the characters and more reasoning behind Kidmans failure to wholly commit, if only intellectually, to one man forever.

Some people of course are too normal for this.

B000006NPY|5.0|I once saw an interview with Billy Corgan about this album where he said that everyone thought that they were some huge heavy metal band, and he was trying to prove them that they were something more on this CD. And that is true. Adore is probably one of the best efforts Smashing Pumpkins have ever put out. It's diverse, heartfelt, dark and bright. The use of synthesizers on here reminds me of early NIN but the lyrics aren't ususally as dark as Reznor's. True, Adore will turn away the close minded people who only like this band for Bullet With Butterfly Wings, but for open-minded people, there is a REALLY good disc waiting for you. Best tracks: Tear, Daphne Descends and For Martha, which is dedicated to Billy's mother who passed away.
B000002UV9|5.0|I've always heard of Queensryche, but thought they were just another hair band from Seattle. This was unfair. I did like Silent Lucidity, but that was it. Then, I heard the song Empire on Vh1. I loved it. Just with 2 songs, I wanted to get the album. Prog-rock at it's best. Geoff Tate's vocals are amazing. I love it when he sings &quot;EMPIRE!&quot; in the title track. Chris Degarmo writes excellent songs that fit with the mainstream, but is still good. Check out &quot;Best I Can.&quot; That's a great song for everything. Also, they know how to write great ballads, Silent Lucidity, for example. Very Pink Floyd-ish. Also, it is very dreamy. Della Brown is very moody. Nice chord usage. Get this, I think it might be better than Mindcrime. But, I haven't heard it, so I don't know.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Ever since I first picked up S.C.I.E.N.C.E. I have been a die-hard fan of Incubus. They are totally different from all the run-of-the-mill garbage that is out right now. Every CD they have released has been better than the one before, which is not to say that the previous CD's are bad at all, in fact, they are awesome! Morning View starts off with one of the best track, Nice To Know You, which in typical Incubus fashion, mixes their softer side with their heavier side. Circles has become my favorite song off of this album so far, it brings back the glory days of Fungus Amongus with the funk sound twisted in with Incubus' newer, slicker style, old fans will definetly love this track. Mexico is also another standout, the use of the orchestra is great, and I'm glad they went all the way with it this time. Other noteworthy tracks: Blood on the Ground, Aqueous Transmission, Are You In, Have You Ever and Warning. Don't let the haters tell you they went soft. Incubus are a real band with real thoughts and real emotions. They have great talent and are better than just about any other band out there right now. You can have your Slipknot, and I'll have my nice, soft, &quot;sell-out&quot; Incubus.
0140149295|5.0|I saw the movie the Hurricane and I became inspired by the story of Rubin Carter.  I have seen the movie 3 times and i have read the book &quot;The Hurricane&quot; by James S. Hirsch but, this is the most discriptive story and you'll find yourself reading it any time you can.  I highly recomend this book.  It is the best book I have ever readdddd!!!!!!!!!
B00004WIBW|5.0|This movie is great.  A bit gruesome for just about any age.  Of course, keep in mind this adapatation of the book is no where near it (with the exception of the characthers.)  In the original story, no one is murdered and the headless hessian is just a hoax. Not so the movie.  Constable Ichabod Crane tries to prove justice needs explanation but is sent on his way to Sleepy Hollow to investigate and track down the person responsible for 3 deaths.  He, thinks that it is no Hessian spirit.  But as the victims pile up, so does his encounters with the undead rider!  Alas, I cannot say more, only you can view for yourself.  But I give this great movie a 5!  Whoo hoo!
B00004RHZU|5.0|This is one Cd that took me by a surprise. I got to listen to this after a friend of mien gave it to me. After one listen it made me wonder why i didnt get in on this from the time it came out. Every song here is tight and you dont get bored listening to this over and over. Its R+B, Hip-Hop and Pop all in one wiht tight lyrics and beats. The songs I liek the most are: You make me sick, Most girls, There you go, Split Personality, Let me let you know, Do what you do and Is it love. Overall she couldnt have come stronger and if you have any doubts about this.......just listen. You will want to take it home too.
B00003CXAA|2.0|first of all the movies expect three are great movies and anybody who watches movies know this. The problem is the box set where do i start the transfer of one is almost unwatchable specks and grain thourgout, lighting is also very bad. The second and escpecially the third are deccent but nothing to write home about, the packing is awful and each time the discs are watched and returned to the cases they get scratched. why make a box set like this the rocky and superman boxes were packaged better then this although they had very few features expect on the first movies.The only thing good abot the set is the fifth disc of bonus materails they are nice and enjoyable, bottom line don't buy this they will issue a new and better version very soon am sure just like thier doing for almost famous in decemember.
B000002UEB|5.0|hands down the best queensryche album of them all. i had the pleasure of picking this album up by chance and haven't been the same since. this album is the benchmark that other bands should aspire to.  from the haunting opener \\"i remember now\\" it sets the stage for the next hour of pure metal bliss. each track takes you deeper into the psyche of a person who is manipulated by doctor x and is torn between his love of the needle and his conscience.  an absolute masterpiece. there isn't one song or note out of place. form the headbanging riffs of revolutin calling  and the needle lies, to the quiet sadness of suite sister mary and i don't believe in love. you must have this c.d. in your collection.
B00000ILBK|5.0|I am a British Viewer of Star Trek, and wish to write in defence of Star Trek: Insurrection. I know quite a lot of people who hugely dislike star trek, but when I introduce them to it, this is the film I show them first, I mean, okay First Contact is a great film for Trekkies and non-trekkies alike, but in Insurrection, you are subtly introduced to the charachters, which strangley I find, makes all of the previous films (TNG) more enjoyable. The story is a mixed affair, and alot of character relationships are explored. I find it thouroughly enjoyable and reccomend it to anyone, a Fan or Not.
B000001ESP|5.0|I remember buying the original vinyl of Rush- Moving Pictures when it came out in 1981. Moving Pictures is as close to a &quot;perfect&quot; album as can be. Moving Pictures is a recording that has withstood the test of time and people will probably still be listening to it 30 years from now in awe! My opinion of every song:<BR>1. Tom Sawer- Probably the most popular song on Moving Pictures. Even people who aren't familiar with the music of Rush will know this classic! Great opening track with incredible lyrics by Neil Peart.<BR>2. Red Barchetta- This track is still played quite frequently on many AOR radio stations. Again, incredible lyrics by Peart describing a futuristic world, rebellion and holding on to a simpler way of life.<BR>3. YYZ- Outstanding instrumental with Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart showcasing their incredible skills.<BR>4. Limelight- Great tune about perspective. How fans percieve those in the limelight and how those in the limelight protect their privacy and sanity.<BR>5. The Camera Eye- In my opinion, The Camera Eye is the second strongest track on Moving Pictures. I love how this epic builds to a climax. Another track about perspective and relativity.<BR>6. The Which Hunt- &quot;Ignorance, predjudice and fear walk hand in hand&quot;- in my opinion, the strongest track on Moving Pictures. A song about ignorance and intollerance.<BR>7. Vital Signs- Outstanding track to end this classic recording. Not my favorite Rush song on Moving Pictures but still great.<br />Also, the recording quality of Moving Pictures at the time was head and shoulders above most other rock recordings released in 1981. The remastered CD version will bring tears to your eyes as far as clairity and quality- absolute perfection!!!<br />If you are a fan of great music then buy Moving Pictures. If you are just a casual listener, buy it! Moving Pictures can appeal to &quot;die hard&quot; Rush fans like myself and those who are not that familiar with Rush.
B00005221M|3.0|Perhaps &quot;ruins&quot; is a little strong, but it fits in the title line. My biggest objection is that Michael Mann ruined the eloquently simplicity of the closing scene to insert a long polemic about what the white man had done to the indians. If it had been supported by the events of the story, I would have accepted it, but it was totally out of context, and comes across as a rambling diatribe. Furthermore, he cut one of the best visuals of his original movie, a silent profile shot of the three surviving heroes. Mann's original theatrical and VHS release was one of the great movies ever made, from story to cast to score to cinematography, but the new ending of the &quot;directors edition&quot; ruined it for me. I will only watch my older VHS edition. I would give a great deal to get a DVD of the original, but it doesn't appear to exist.
B00004YM0D|5.0|Wow.  I grew up a little after this era in Northern California where racism wasn't an issue.  This was a wonderful historically accurate movie with an amazing soundtrack!  After watching the movie (which is also a 5) we ordered the soundtrack and now cannot help dancing and singing along with the great tunes selected for the CD.  This is a collection that the whole family can enjoy and when you listen to it, you just feel good.  &quot;Peace Train&quot; could not be more appropriate as well as &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;.  Very fun and upbeat CD.  I bought one for my brother-in-law so he could sing along with &quot;Act Naturally&quot; at his birthday party.  This is a must have for your collection.
B00005R87Q|3.0|To all you who love car movies, this one kicks some major you know what.  Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances.  Also the chick is hot, cars are PHAT, and the movie is non-stop action.  If you love movies like Gone in 60 seconds and Driven, you will love this.  It is a must own movie.  To all the H-town All-Stars this is for you.  I'M OUT!!!!!!!
B00005LKIM|4.0|I think that a lot of people go way too hard on Hannibal. Personally, I love it. Dr. Lecter is his usual awesome self, and Anthony Hopkins does his usual exceptional demonstration of gifted acting ability. Paul Krendler deserved whatever he got (I never liked him anyway), and I thought everything was very original. Who would have thought up man-eating boars!? <br />Character development, which most people say sucked in Hannibal, with Clarice and the good doctor was for the most part done in Silence of the Lambs anyway, so whatever Hannibal lacked, it already had its foundation in Silence. <br />I liked this movie very, very much.

B00005MP58|5.0|It is because of this series that I read Jane Austen to begin with - and Pride and Prejudice is just such a wonderful story!<br />I found this adaptation to be completely faithful to the novel. Great acting, very funny and enlightening. I would not have expected that a novel like this could be faithfully portrayed on film, but they did a wonderful job.<br />I especially liked Mrs. Bennet in this film, but really, all the actors were superb.<br />The costumes and scenery were lovely, the dialogue witty, the story romantic. This is indeed a great &quot;chick-flick&quot; - I watched it with my 7 year old daughter, and the romantic-hearted girl is now a die-hard Austen fan as well.<br />Very well done! Highly recommended to all romantically-inclined individuals.
B00000JSJC|4.0|The wailing banshee that surfaces in one of the nightclubs during this movie was my first contact with Skin from Skunk Anansie, and one of the reasons I bought this DVD. One of my favourites.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is a great movie. It is in my top 5 list of all time. And the DVD is great quality. An epic.
B000002KIE|5.0|I've seen so much retarded reviews it's mind bugging..This album changed the way music could and should be...sure the Ramones came out earlier...and sure the Ramones could play better...and sure the Ramones are more respected...but c'mon can you really compare &quot;Blitzgrieg Bop&quot;..to &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;?..or &quot;I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend&quot;..to &quot;No Feelings&quot;...and whatever else..and the Clash..ha...the Clash may have been trying to broaden their horizons and play different music..but they did it poorely..the Clash as a punk band were tame..and the Clash as a rock band were laughable...something about British guys trying to play Regaee and singing about Jamacia was just hillarious..not that the Clash really sucked...they had great songs...but don't dare compare the Clash or the Ramones as the &quot;true punk band&quot;<br />Now the talk of the Pistols being a manufactured band...well you've just given into McClaren's boring ramblings about how he invented punk rock too...it was what the Pistols represented in that time....rebellion...angst...they may not have given a care about punk rock...but they hit on something beautiful...and whether you hate them or love them..if it wasnt for the Pistols we'd still think bands like Journey and Boston were heavy metal...this album was influential..get over it...stop whining..<br />The Pistols couldnt play....good....less talent...it identified with the common kid...picked up a guitar learned a few chords...formed his own band..gave hope to a dissilussioned youth...not everyone was meant to be a Jimmy Page<br />Musically...it's great...raw angst filled punk<BR>&quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;...&quot;God Save the Queen&quot;...&quot;Bodies&quot;..&quot;Seventeen&quot;..these are classics<br />There is also the &quot;hey the Pistols signed to a major label..they werent punk..they were on Warner Bros. what sellouts&quot;<BR>Ha well...yes they were on major labels...and they stole their money...ripped them all off...got rich and they got poor..by doing absolutely nothing but being brats...and c'mon this is 1977...what the hell was punk rock then really?..there was no &quot; HEY YOU CAN'T BE ON A MAJOR LABEL..IT'S AGAINST THE RULES&quot;..ideas<BR>it was really just music then<br />you people seriously whine too much...get over it
6305263248|2.0|One of the hard things to believe about this movie is that an undercover CIA agent, played by Deniro, will actually go through surgery, having a bullet removed, by an amatuer in order not to blow his cover. This would never happen in real life. Also, the alternate ending on the DVD did not make much sense to me. This has all of the cliche's of all action movies, long car chase scenes, guns shooting, and the mysterious betrayals left and right, not knowing who is on who's side. Further, this is not Deniro's best performance. I would pass on this one.
B00005RDVW|5.0|\\"Peter Pan\\" still retains its charm, wit and heart expressed in its animation, which has been cleaned up quite a bit, while faithfully following Barbie's book. It's probably the film that spawned the adventurous 1991 \\"Hook,\\" but this animated feature is far better than \\"Hook.\\"<br />\\"Peter Pan\\" is when two English parents leave for a party, leaving behind the nursemaid dog Nana and their three children, Wendy, Michael, and John behind. Not long after their parents have left, Peter Pan and his tiny accomplice Tinker Bell crash in, looking for Peter's shadow, spawning the entertaining, funny, and charming results, leading to a fluffernutter happy ending.<br />What this is one of Disney's latter classics that remains one of my favorite Disney classics, among the handsomely made \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" that wins you over with its captivating animation and the lush classical music, while \\"Bambi\\" wins you over with heart and good nature. But \\"Peter Pan\\" wins you over with heart, humor and just the right amount of magic. <br />The special edition VHS and DVD come with a free movie ticket to see the sequel \\"Return to Neverland\\" and it comes fully restored to its original brilliance, which makes it all the more enjoyable to see and hear this delightful Disney feature. Perfect for anyone looking for 77 minutes to spare.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is a great soundtrack. I can listen to it over and over and over, and I never get tired of it. It carries you along with undercurrents of recurring themes, but instead of being tiring, they combine into an integrated theme that works so well. It doesn't hurt that I loved the move and the soundtrack ties in so well with that. But even measured indepently of the movie, this is a great album.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|It's the story of a man who has a memory problem-he can't make new memories. By itself that doesn't sound like it would make a great plot for a great movie but add to that the fact that this poor man has this memory problem because two guys broke into his home, broke his head (which caused the memory condition) and raped and murdered his wife. Then add to that that now he is on a mission to find the man who did this, but because he has this &quot;condition&quot; he has to take pictures and write notes to aid him and you have the makings of a great story. Now you need a great screenplay, great acting, and great direction. You get all this and more in this wonderful movie. I'm impressed. Guy Pearce turned in a simply stunning performance as the poor man with the memory problem-Leonard Shelby, and Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano supply key supporting roles as friends (or enemies) of Leonard. Christopher Nolan's screenplay is presented to the best advantage by the fact that the story is told in reverse chronological order, and some people may find that annoying or gimmicky, but I assure it works. The audience needed it that way-why?, you may ask? Well, to better understand the agonizing plight Leonard is in we need to see events the way he's forced to, meaning we don't know what happened BEFOREHAND to get us to the point we're at. This is sheer genius storytelling, because we as the audience are swept up in this story along with Leonard as we too try to figure out who's the real villian. Brilliant!

B000002H2H|5.0|Next to Master of Puppets, this is the greatest Metallica album out there.  Fade to Black is my favorite song of all time...it is so moving and incredibly well written that it can bring tears to your eyes.  Creeping Death and For Whom the Bell Tolls are staples in the Metallica library.  In fact, this album is nearly as good as Master...it is the middle songs that makes the difference.  I am not saying that Escape or Trapped Under Ice are bad songs, but they aren't the greatest that the band ever wrote.  But this is definetely a must have for any metalhead.
B000005ALN|5.0|I bought this album when it first dropped in the spring of 1996.  Five years later, my wife and I STILL have it on rotation.  For me, Michael's almost-perfect voice and phrasing, coupled with the mature, American jazz-British soul-Brazilian jazz brew, make this without question one of the top albums of the 1990s.  I believe the critics panned the album because of Michael's &quot;hubris&quot; in wanting to be treated as a mature artist as oppose to being locked into his Wham! days (which I enjoyed also).  Don't sleep: &quot;Older&quot; is Exhibit A in why you never should take a critic's word at face value.  This is a masterpiece.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Very entertaining. Animation is at it's best in this cute little movie adults and children will enjoy.
6305537798|4.0|this is a funny movie.  Kind of a chick flick.  There is a nice fender strat in it.  Should have been a gibson though.  Oh, and some chick band redid Cheap Trick's &quot;I want you to want me.&quot;  People, dont redue cheap trick.  You just shouldn't!
0451191153|1.0|I first read this novel about 30 years ago, when I was, of all things, an architecture student. I was fascinated. As time passed, the details of the novel receded from my memory, but I had occassion to learn more about objectivism. I don't believe in it mayself, but I do understand it and respect it as a vital contribution to our intellectual history and an importamnt expression of principles underlying one school of thought inour ongoing political/economic debates.<BR>Recently, I found myself bumping into Ms. Rand's ideals, through TV specials, etc. I decided it would be a good time to refresh my understainding of The Fountainhead. Ouch. I guess I was a bit naive when I read it the first time. Coming back to it now, after years of adult life experience (and exposure to a lot more literature), I found the characters hopelesly one dimensional; not evil, as some critics claim. Just horrendously shallow. And it's a shame becasue Ms. Rand fully understands the setting of the novel; the issues that reeally did polarize architecture back at that time. But her characters come of like .... pod people is the only phrase that keeps coming to mind.
B000050XEI|1.0|I can't believe this album is actually selling. I'll admit it, I'm an Enya fan but A DAY WITHOUT RAIN is her WORST album yet. It's the same chanting, plucking strings, more chanting. After that 5 year break she took, I was expecting something new, innovative and exciting. But all you have here it seems, is b-side material. The only exception is &quot;only time&quot; which is actually a decent song. If you want Enya at her best then PAINT THE SKY WITH STARS is your best bet. It's got all of her best works on there. A DAY WITHOUT RAIN is a big dud.
0316776963|1.0|I found this book a struggle to get through.  It had nothing substantial in it to hold one's interest.  I wish I had been warned before commiting myself to reading it.  Torture......Boring......I'm glad its over.......Never Again!
B0000028RR|5.0|Let me first say that i am a real music fan and I like to listen to all kinds of music. I have more than 200+ cds and this record is the sh-t. It is IMO one of the top3 albums of the century along with &quot;are u experienced&quot; (Hendrix) and &quot;Appetite&quot; (GnR). It is really good. It has tremendous amount of energy and the lyrics are so meaningful. The guitar playing is I would say fantastic and Tom is my pick for the guitarist of the 90s (Check out BOLA for Tom's finest work on the guitar). The rythm duos are also really good in this album. Overall this album is funky, raw, and eneretic. Do ur self a favor and buy this album!!!<br />And for those who gave this album a bad rating without justification yall should just f kin go and listen to Britney Spears and NSync.
0131103628|5.0|I've read some C language text books, and they all fell short in some (or even many) way.<br />This book is short, to the point, exact and clear.<br />Many useful examples, with motivating reasons for those examples.<br />I found this book  useful not only to beginners in C (as a textbook) but also as a reference book for experienced programmers, and a good reference for people teaching the C programming language.<br />In many C courses they give &quot;A book on C&quot; and this book as the course textbooks - I say forget about the ABC book - and stick to this one - you won't regret it.

B000003TAW|5.0|this is just simply one of the greatest albums of all time. every song can be listened to over and over again, it just never gets old. here is a ranking of each individual song:<BR>ranked 1-10, 1 being worst and 10 being best<BR>my name is jonas (7.5): there first single. good lyrics if you listen closely, fair guitar work.<BR>no one else (2): worse song on the entire album. trite lyrics and an uncatchy beat. one of weezer only failures<BR>the world has turned (6): not the best on the album, but certainly not the worst. nice guitar work but simple lyrics<BR>buddy holly (10): the best song ever written by weezer. great guitar, catchy lyrics, i always find myself singing this one in the shower<BR>the sweater song (8): also a very good song with a very catchy chorus. would be a 10 but the ending is just stupid.<BR>surf wax america (6.5): a fair song, the lyrics are very trite and unprofound<BR>say it aint so (9): another all time great weezer song. simple but nice guitar line, make sure to listen to the sub-chorus at the end, it has very nice lyrics. <BR>in the garage (9.5): second-best weezer song ever writte. this song and &quot;buddy holly&quot; are in a league of there own.<BR>holiday (4): would be nice except for awful segment during the middle of the song. that section is just plain crap<BR>only in dreams (7): nice lyrics and melody. would have a higher score but it is just plain too long
B000000OEI|4.0|Crimson Tide was a revolutionary score. It was the first of it`s kind and followed up by dozens and dozens of imitations in the forthcoming years after its release in 1995. It started a whole new subgenre of film music - the technique of mixing classical music and chorus with rock guitars and synthesizers. <BR>This is probably one of the greatest themes Mr. Zimmer has composed. It starts out as if it will become the Force theme from Star Wars,but then it doesn`t change. It is sounding both heroic and uplifting,especially the end credits suite (here named &quot;Roll Tide&quot;). In a full orchestra and chorus it bursts out as a loud,bombastic action theme perfect for a submarine war movie. This kind of themes latter became typical for Hans Zimmer,as he used similar music in both &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;. It is easy to rember,too. <BR>As Zimmer was allowed to use The London Symphony Orchestra and London Voices to perform it,it sounds great too. <BR>Then,let`s have some negative words. <BR>There are only five tracks on the CD and it runs on for 60 minutes!I sometimes like long tracks,and it is said that they are that long for best listening experience. Yes,that worked well in &quot;The Rock&quot;,as it had plenty of good themes and the music changed a lot. But take the second track (Alabama),for example. <BR>It runs on for 24 minutes!And there are many moments when the music is nearly standing still,and you just want something to happen. The best music is buried 5 to 15 minutes into the tracks,and it is too bad you have to wait that long before hearing your favorite music.<BR>Well,I do not say that this score is bad. This is actually one of the Hans Zimmer`s greatest soundtracks ever. The music itself is very good,but it is the way it`s placed on CD that is wrong. <BR>I mean,the tracks are all too long. At least ten tracks would be better. It works well in the film,but not on CD. <BR>Crimson Tide is a modern classic among film scores,but it would be easier to accept it if the tracks were shorter. OK,if you want the best music,then the first and the last track is recommended listening. Track 2 and 4 contains some great action cues,but you have to wait a while before they appear.<BR>Well,the choice is up to you now. If you want a good theme,then there is no better Zimmer score. If you want great action cues,then &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; is strongly recommended.<BR>But this one is fantastic too!
B000023X9W|5.0|The main complaint I hear from critics of this album is that it is self-indulgent or &quot;not the Neil we all love.&quot;  Well, if you're looking for another look at some preconceived notion of Neil Young (i.e. the slashing, burning guitar maniac of &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; and &quot;Weld&quot;) then I would direct you to his other recent offering, &quot;Road Rock, Vol. 1.&quot;  Not that these sort of albums aren't fantastic, but when I get done listening to them I only feel like I know Neil Young the musician.  After an album like &quot;Silver and Gold,&quot; however, I feel like I have an idea of Neil Young the man.  This is an incredible opus of one man's self-reflection, centered around (as is usual with a man) the idea of love and what it means to him.  The guitar work is incredible and I always love Neil's harmonica.  It's true, it doesn't sound as polished as perhaps &quot;Harvest&quot; or &quot;After the Gold Rush,&quot; but is that so bad?  It's always been my belief that you get closer to the heart of an artist when you peal away all the layers of studio editing.  Yes, this work is a very personal statement.  Neil Young isn't catering to anybody, and I respect that.  Too many times is an artist burned for trying to explore new frontiers and let the public in on what he's really feeling.  Other examples of this are the poor reception Bob Dylan got when he released &quot;Self Portrait,&quot; his quest for musical identity, or the burning the critics gave Cat Stevens when he released &quot;Foreigner,&quot; his own personal statement on love (though worlds apart from Neil's).  Those are also two albums I love very much.  If you want to stay in your hole, I would only recommend this to you because you might like the &quot;pretty guitar.&quot;  But if you really want to get a step closer to knowing Neil, this is a must have.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|Whilst the animation was superb, the content was disturbing.<br />Eddy Murphy was actually the funniest and better voice over. Mike Myers was extremely unconvincing as an ogre and what a poor attempt at a Scottish accent, his performance was dull and lacked emotion. Cameron Diaz could have been anyone - nothing outstanding there.<br />This is a kids' movie??? We were shocked by the violence and the extremely unfunny cruelty to animals. Once we had endured the fight scene, the parts that really bothered us were firstly, when the Princess sings to a bird, delightfully heartwarming at first, then she purposefully sings so loudly and high pitched that the bird explodes, leaving its legs and three eggs behind, the eggs are promptly fried up for breakfast. Secondly, when Shrek blows into a frog's mouth, inflating it into a balloon. These scenes are completely unsuitable for children - what do they teach our impressionable youngsters? We gave up watching at this point, glad that we had decided to censor before our four year old got a chance to see the movie.<br />Bottom Line - don't waste your time and money, Disney does it much, much better.
0553213105|5.0|It is generally considered a pretty, romantic book - like a swan on a lake.  But much like the swan, it's what happening underneath that's important.  I have always admired this book for its wit and sharp observations but also for the title.  Clever and astute, as usual.  But is it Elizabeth who is proud and Darcy who is prejudiced?  Or vice versa?  Or are they both proud and prejudiced?  These questions keep me re-reading this masterpiece at least once a year and I change my mind about the answers every time. This book will give me a lifetime of pleasure.
0784011710|5.0|I watched &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; not knowing at all what to expect.  I  assumed that the &quot;choice&quot; would be something commonplace in a film, like a choice between two lovers.  When I found out what the choice really was, it made a very deep impression on me.  It was the most gut-wrenching thing I have ever seen, in the movies or in real life.  The scene is unforgettable.  The emotionless evil of the SS officer offering Sophie the choice is highly disturbing.  The man is extremely cold, almost Satanic in the evil he radiates.  The strange thing is that he is not physically ugly-at first I thought the part was played by Alec Baldwin.  This is easily the best portrayal of the Holocaust I've seen on film, much better than &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  The evil of Auschwitz is so all-encompassing, so icy and devoid of emotion, that I can't help but think that it is the closest thing to Hell ever recreated on Earth.<br />     Also, Meryl Streep's performance is by far the best I have ever seen in any film.  Her virtuosity and technical brilliance are unmatched.  One reviewer compared it to DeNiro in &quot;Raging Bull,&quot; and I have to agree.  The supporting performances are excellent, especially Peter McNicol who is indispensable as the narrator.  The one flaw I found with the film (and probably with the novel as well, although I have not read it) is Stingo's (the author's) highly self-conscious fixation on sex.  I thought that it was irrelevant to the story.  To anyone who feels that the film is too slow-paced, I say keep watching action movies until you grow up and leave superb films like these to people emotionaly mature enough to appreciate them.<br />    On the whole, I would rate this among the best films I've ever seen.  Definitely don't miss it!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I had the misfortune of listening to the execrable Kid A before this, so I was a bit wary at first. But although it took a few listens to grow on me, I can honestly say that OK Computer deserves the praise that has been heaped upon it.<br />Musically, it's a very impressive record. At first, it may seem strange, but there is actually a great number of hooks on this album, in addition to odd time signatures, complex rhythms and the like. The lyrics are likewise odd, but do possess a sort of emotional resonance. &quot;Exit Music&quot; is absolutely gorgeous; &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; is strangely evocative (and unique in that it seems to turn a passage from a book into a very tuneful song); &quot;Karma Police&quot; is quite the witty number. And &quot;Climbing Up The Walls&quot; is just downright frightening (&quot;Open up your skull...I'll be there...&quot; sung in Yorke's disembodied drawl made me jump the first time I heard it). &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;Airbag&quot; seem to be songs that celebrate life, but do have a wonderful sort of underlying melancholy to them. And &quot;Electioneering&quot; is a nice slice of rawk that sounds out of place at first, then becomes one of the stronger tracks with its great chorus. Sure, &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is pretty ridiculous, and the bafflingly popular &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is one of the weaker tracks, but seeing as the former is only about two minutes long, and the latter does have enough groovy guitarwork and catchy choruses (the way Yorke calls for the rain is brilliant), that's hardly cause for complaints.<br />This is definitely one of the best albums to come out in a while. It's certainly the best thing Radiohead have ever recorded, and probably ever will. The verdict: stay away from the self-indulgently arty Kid A at all costs, but pick up OK Computer at once. It's a very memorable, very melodic and very good album, and even if does take a couple of listens to like, the results are very rewarding.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I just LOVE this movie, but am frustrated because I'd love for my kids to be able to own it and they can't.<br />What's great about this movie:  The story line is awesome, the female lead [Princess Fiona, Cameron Diaz] is a phenomenal *strong* woman, the sound track rules, the animation is gorgeous, the movie is absolutely HYSTERICAL in many places, the sly takes on Disney are very entertaining, etc.  [This is the best fairly tale *I've* ever seen or read].<br />What stinks about this movie:  I have a 3 year old daughter who LOVED this movie and Princess Fiona [a great antidote to one too many Disney heroines she's been exposed to], but I can't buy this DVD for her and I feel a little chagrinned that we let her watch it once to begin with.  The word &quot;Damn&quot; is used twice [Gads - I know its not the end of the world, but I don't need my sweet little girl saying &quot;damn&quot; to grandma...].  The &quot;potty humor&quot; is over the top [and, having a preschooler, I'm pretty tolerant of potty humor].  The &quot;gross out factor&quot; in the beginning is a little over the top too.  Some of the situations are &quot;adult&quot; as well.<br />I'm just sad - by leaving a few little things out here and there [like curse words and fart jokes], this could have been an awesome fairly tale for little girls who NEED to see a heroine who can take up for herself.  And what a GREAT message for little girls in the age of anorexia anyway...[if you've seen the end, you know what I mean here].  We wouldn't need to &quot;Revive Ophelia&quot; if we had more heroines like Fiona around.<br />This is a GREAT movie - I just wish I could buy it for my kids.
0783226160|5.0|Animal House was released in 1978, runs for 109 minutes and was directed by John Landis at Universal Studios.   There are numerous actors and actresses in the film, some of the most famous are:  John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Kevin Bacon, and Donald Sutherland.<br />Animal House takes place in the early 60's at Farber College.  This film's genre is a comedy of morals as it definitely uses ridicule to correct abuses aimed at a college fraternity.  The plot of this movie is a party happy fraternity having too much of a good time with a dean that wants them gone using the \\"goody two shoes\\" fraternity against them.  The climax comes when Dean Wormer kicks the whole fraternity out of college. The soundtrack to this movie is awesome for the sounds of the sixties.<br />On a scale of one to five stars, this film is a five.    Animal House is a classic comedy.  It is just as funny now as it was when it was released 22 years ago.  John Belushi is extremely convincing in his drunken frat role as Bluto as is Tim Matheson in his womanizing role of Otter.  Even though this movie is about college life, it is also a movie with the basic concept of good against bad.  The bad fraternity in the eyes of the dean are the good guys of the movie and the good fraternity in the eyes of the dean are the bad guys of the movie.  It is easy to get wrapped up in cheering for the Delta house good guys.  It portrays the 60's as they were with parties, students experimenting with drugs and getting stoned on pot, as well as students in \\"free-love\\" sexual situations. It is a fun movie to watch and everyone should have this movie in their home video library.
0385501005|5.0|After reading other stories such as Bridget Jone's Diary, Mr. Perfet and some other brit-chick novels.  It's a huge change reading a book like this from a male perspective.  So far, I like this book.  Duffy, is a very funny guy.  It's a great book.
B00005K2UF|5.0|I only recently discovered the New York Voices. I wonder how I could possibly have missed them. &quot;I'll be Seeing You&quot; is perfect. I can't listen to anything else after it. I know I am a recent convert, so my enthusiasm may wane, but it may not, who knows?
B00003CXXJ|1.0|It is a throw-back of Disney Animation, but with a spice for modernization.  It's characters are curt, wholesome characters, the humor I found boring and undermining to the likes of Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz.  Do they really need to work so badly as to diminish themselves to hidden comedy.  It's a far cry from their acting abilities so well demonstrated in the likes of &quot;The Golden Child&quot;, and &quot;Something About Mary&quot;.  Cummon, do they need to make themselves so invisible here?<br />If you like comedy, go find the artistic expression in its live form; bury this &quot;Toy Story&quot; nonsense already.  It's played out with Tom Hanks.  Give me something like the presence of Paula Poundstone or Rodney Dangerfield, live.  Even Rodney strut his &quot;stuff&quot; in &quot;Caddyshack&quot;.  :)  And please, let the kids find something less contrived to laugh at, like the &quot;Tubbies&quot; or &quot;Smerfs&quot;.  They will be adults soon enough; they don't need the adult addages that this &quot;Shrek&quot; infers throughout its entirety.  kz
0671027379|5.0|Though Rachel has never met President Zach Herney, her father Senator Sedgewick Sexton is upset with her because she works for the administration as an agent of the National Reconnaissance Office.  Sedgewick wants his daughter to quit her job and join his campaign for the presidency as he insists her working for the administration hurts his presidential ambitions.<br /><br />  NASA has uncovered quite a find in the Arctic that the agency believes will help them from Sedgewick's constant bulldog attack, as the politician uses the agency as a whipping post for his executive office run.  Rachel travels to the site where NASA scientists diligently work to recover a meteor, which apparently contains ET fossils.  However, though she wonders why she was sent, Rachel and scientist Michael Tolland realizes nothing makes sense especially with Delta Force soldiers standing nearby seemingly ready to assault the NASA encampment.<br /><br />DECEPTION POINT is an exciting techno-thriller that contains cleverly incorporated scientific know how to propel the story line forward,.  When the tale resides in the Arctic, it is a powerful chilling thriller, but when the plot focuses on DC and its double crossing backstabbing political environs, the story line slows down.  As a techno-thiller, Dan Brown paints a superb masterpiece; as a political thriller Mr. Brown scribes a stick figure.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00003CXRP|3.0|If you saw the movie and you liked it then you will like the DVD. And if you havent seen the movie and if you collect DVDs this is a good one to add to your collection.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I consider myself a big star wars fan, and I wish I didn't waste my money on this DVD. The hype on this is very over rated. All the news on the deleted sense being so great. They were ok but the better ones of course were on the second disk and not part of the movie at all. Who was the idiot that decided that one? I don't know about anyone else but I buy DVD's to see the deleted sense during the movie not separate! Save your money. It's not worth it unless you are a die-hard fan but even then be prepared to be disappointed.
B00003CX5P|5.0|If you liked the movie or you at least kind of liked it and you love DVDs this is one of the best. 2 dics i full of extras showiing everything you could want. If you are a DVD fan this is a must to get.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I believe Monty Python had an impact on comedy that was so all-pervasive, it staggers the mind to consider the magnitude of it. This movie, their first, became a classic and my all-time favorite comedy the very first time I saw it. I left the theater thinking to myself, &quot;That flick will never be surpassed in its own genre of comedy.&quot; And, I was right.<br />I have probably watched this film at least 45 - 50 times, and yet, I still catch something new everytime. Some new funny line that I never picked up before.<br />I know a review should give some hint as to what the plot is all about, so I will tell you this: The plot borrows a little from the ancient story of King Arthur. Arthur and his men are given instructions by God to find the Holy Grail. They must overcome many harrowing experiences to achieve this goal. For instance, they have to appease the dreaded &quot;Knights Who Say Nee!&quot; (Hint: Just don't use the word, &quot;it&quot; in front of them!) Arthur is forced to fight the Black Knight - this scene is very bloody -- not for children. Then, there is the bridge of death. &quot;He who wishes to pass this bridge must answer me these questions three,&quot; says the bridge-keeper, a very scary individual, indeed.<br />Arthur and his men prove themselves to be very courageous - well, except for Robin.<br />I won't tell you if they achieve their goal, but I will say the ending is quite a twist in the plot.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|This movie looked really good from the previews. It didn't tell much about the story, but I don't think that mattered for most people. People saw this movie for one of two reasons: The action or Angelina Jolie. I saw it for both. The movie was not as good as I expected it to be. My friend who I saw it with loved it unbelieveably. I thought the story was weak and just corny. I have never played any Tomb Raider games and I can just tell I really don't see how this fits into any of them except the idea of &quot;tomb raiding&quot;. But a strong point of this was the action in this movie was not bad at all. I think the movie itself was made very well. But it could have been improved on in many ways. They say a sequel is in the works. I just hope that they do see that there were parts of this movie which were just relavent.

B00005QJDG|5.0|Dream Theater`s new live album, is just the best i`ve ever heard, it`s just amazing and incredible, when i first listen that this album was coming out, and read the tracks that were include, i just ask mysel, whta can i expect form this album, and the answer is pretty obvious, you`re gonna get the best from the best.<br />That`s what you get with this live album, you have the chance to listen Scenes from a memory in its enterity, change of season and a mind behid itself, too, so you get a a complete lave album, entire epic songs, incredible solo by Jordan Rudess, and as usual outstanding performances from the five members of DT, but i`ve to say that James LaBrie`s performance was simply the best i`ve ever heard from him, i mean he sang for almost 3 hours, and his voice even though it sound a little bit tired at the end (understandable), still have the power to reach new levels, with this performance by LaBrie, you have to undertsatnd why his the best vocalist out there.<br />during the entire 3cd live album you can listen to all dream theater`s albums, except the when dream and daya unite, but you go from the images an word album, to the SCFM album, inlcuding Acid rain from the LTE2, so you got everythin you want and more <br />But if all this things are not enough, i have to say that for me listen for the first time Another Day, played with saxophone by Jay Beckenstein, was just breath taking, `cause this song was the one who makes me listen Dream Theater`s music, and having the chance to listen just the way it has to be played, was simply overwhelming. so if you want the best live album ever, i can say Scenes from new york, just fit that concept.
078401213X|2.0|Patterns exist everywhere, the world is illusive with an ordered infinity lurking behind every corner. The golden ratio divides us all, and we follow this organized section, but sometimes I guess it skips a generation or so, well this time we can take the example of the Screenwriter, and the Director of this film's mind.<br />In trying to search for the illusive Pi amongst the universe, and to find patterns within segments of thought, the pseudo intellectual mockery of the Screenplay has left it more random than ever, and given us what we may so delicately put it as &quot;gas&quot; and nothing more.<br />Max a neurotic on the loose trying to find the code of God through a 216 digit number is able to through his deranged thoughts derange our serious nature and shun us into a corner where we laugh ourselves to death.<br />This is what we call film making where we take a serious subject like the Pi and we mix it with some pseudo &quot;gas&quot; and then what do we get is a volatile output of nitrous oxide (laughing gas for the unfortunates).<br />But though I would have given this movie a 1 star I chose to give it 2 as the cinematography of the movie is superb, and the camera panning highly stylized.<br />So you are having a down day, and you do not have too many questions coming to your mind, do give this movie a thought, it is a guarantee that it would uplift your spirits, as we all know<BR>&quot;laughter is the best medicine.&quot;
B00005O5N1|4.0|This movie will appeal to all - even the men will enjoy it if they give it a chance.  The heroine (played beautifully by American Renee Zellweger) has more bad vices, cellulite, bad language, and ineptitude than honorable virtues and noble qualities.  Bridget is a character most women can identify with, right down the the outrageous and loud but supportive group of friends.  <br />Hugh Grant's character is so different from the charmingly lovable, tongue-tied misfit he often plays, and he pulls it off perfectly.  Daniel Cleaver is a cocksure, selfish womanizer who plays the charmer in order to get his hands on Bridget and her short skirts.<br />Colin Firth is delightfully in character as Mark Darcy - a barrister that comes off as being haughty and rude, but turns out to be down-to-earth, loving, and so sweet.  And Bridget, like most of us women, has a hard time seeing the real prize.<br />One of the best things about this film is the fact that it completely changes the audience's mind.  You begin by hating Darcy and loving Cleaver... by the end you are completely in love with Darcy and are cheering when he beats the stuffing out of Cleaver.  A delightful, funny, and very romantic film for women and men alike.
0671024256|5.0|This is extremely enlightening, and long overdue, but worth the wait. I enjoyed Mr King's auto biographical notes at the beginning, and while the rest is devoted to his craft, writers and non-writers alike will find the following chapters an insight as to the man's work ethic and love of life. If you love Stephen King, check it out. You won't be dissapointed.
0783226160|4.0|Director John Landis could not have known what he would be starting by releasing the 1978 classic that we all know of as Animal House. The setting being on the Farber college campus, where the haughty frat house sits next door to the Delta frat house. The Delta house serving as a shelter for those such as John Belushi who was in his seventh year of college and nothing to show for it, but a less than 1.0 GPA and Hoover, played by James Widdeos, Hoover just wanted to fit in!  <br />This film is a great parody on college life, certainly those of us old enough to remember the 80's and the toga parties, can appreciate this classic.  I think that Tim Matheson, as Otter and his best friend Boon, played by Peter Riegert were cast for the right characters, they too did an excellent job. I must admit, for me, it is John Belushi, 'Bluto' that steals the show! He is fantastic!
B00003CX5P|2.0|I am a big Star Wars fan.  I loved the first three movies, and I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't.  The whole thing felt forced and disjointed with the known Star Wars universe... just a flashy showing of digital effects.  But worst of all is the child actor - and I use the term loosely - playing Anakin.  His utter inability to emote even a quasi-convincing whoop of joyous victory overshadows any annoyance I may have felt at the infamous Jar-Jar or the cheap army of Binks clones for the last battle scene.<br />All that being said, this DVD has some great extras that makes it worth getting even if you're a Star Wars fan that wants to smack George Lucas with a newspaper for disappointing you with this bewilderingly shallow-even-for-a-Star-Wars-flick movie.

Digging herself deeper in debt with each purchase, she uses her wit and silliness to keep her above water.

Only took me two days to read!
B000001G8A|5.0|Although recorded in 1978 the result remains the finest audio production to date. Set in Northern California during the 1840's gold rush, Zubin Mehta treats Puccini's unique western masterpiece with undaunting artistic care as Placido Domingo (Dick Johnson), Carol Neblett (Minnie) and Sherrill Milnes (Jack Rance) exceed their own extraordinary talents in bringing their characters to life. Supported by a magnificent cast, one in particular deserves high mention. Gwynne Howell, bass, portraying the roving minstrel (Jake Wallace) in the first act, showers the listener with a velvet voice that is pure luxury. His beautiful and haunting aria not only depicts the loneliness and homesickness of the camp's miners, but is one you will want to listen to over and over again. The only regret is that Puccini did not compose more arias for the Jake Wallace role.<br />Focusing upon a pistol packing saloon barmaid who's won the hearts and respect of the local gold miners, plus the sudden arrival of bandits and her involvement with their leader, Minnie's life is thrown into turmoil as a potential lynching lurks ahead.  This is an opera setting, that also includes Native American characters, that deserves far more attention than it receives. The music is exquisite and the artists are all top notch. This recording is a true gem that should not be overlooked.
B00004TWZF|1.0|Already one of the most boring movies ever made, Luc Besson has added insult to injury by putting 50 more minutes of boredom into this agonizingly slow film.  Rosanna Arquette's giggly performance is the cinematic equivalent of fingernails on slate.  Jean-Marc Barr delivers no performance whatsoever, just mugs for the camera with a lost look on his face.  And Jean Reno plays his usual gravel-throated self.  Predictably enough, this film has been artificially elevated to classic cult status by dreary film snobs who think a slow pace equals a deep and meaningful story.  In this case, only the ocean is deep.  The brain behind this film is shallower than a tidal pool.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This is an Emotional Roller Coaster and I love it!  One minute you are Rocking out, dancing around and the next you are almost in tears listening to Hero.  What an AWESOME RANGE of Music from Enrique.  He is truly a CLASS ACT and this CD proves it!
B00004XOWM|5.0|Fred Durst and Limp Bizkit score with this CD. They combine punk, metal, rap, hip-hop, and rock in this incredible selection of songs. The songs vary from rap to metal.  The best songs on the album include My Generaton, My Way, Rollin'(Air Raid), Livin' It Up, Boiler, and It'll Be OK. This is their best CD yet, and I recomend it to anyone who Limps with the Bizkit.

B000000H64|5.0|This is my second favorite fear factory.  My first is obsolete but that might be because it was my first one that i bought.  demanufactured is full of great guitar riffs and mindblowing double pedal. The emotion is really felt.  the songs are much fuller than digimortal. in one of my favorite songs, &quot;self bias resistor&quot; during the chorous you can feel the power of the music.  One of the only songs i don't like is hunter-killer because i don't like the way Burton C. Bell adds his singing voice in the background when screaming &quot;i am a criminal.&quot;  some people say that new breed sounds too much like techno but to me it gives a feeling of uncontrolable fast moving chaos and for once, I like the remix more than the original.  The digipac realy isn't worth finding or spending any extra money on, the two extra songs arn't that great.  The terminator sound go great with the music.<BR>the best songs are demanufactured, self bias resistor, and pisschrist.<br />WHAT EVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY DIGIMORTAL BEFORE THIS OR OBSOLETE!!!
B000002UDB|4.0|Released between Sgt. Pepper's and the white album, The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour is largely overlooked and I don't understand why. It features John Lennon's inspired wit becoming truly baroque (\\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" \\"I Am the Walrus\\"), the continuation of George Harrison's intriguing experimentation with Eastern culture (\\"Blue Jay Way\\"), George Martin's most breathtaking studio wizardry (\\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" \\"All You Need Is Love\\"), some of Paul McCartney's brightest shining pop tunes (\\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"The Fool on the Hill\\") and, of coarse, Ringo performed too. Maybe being basically collection of excellent songs rather than a cohesive experience (like Abbey Road or Sgt. Pepper's) hurt it or perhaps people can not forget that absurdly stupid TV movie it soundtracked. In any case, it is about time Magical Mystery Tour is counted among the Beatles' best work.
B00000IPAX|4.0|When Enema of the State was released, it was a total icebreaker for them, making 3 guys: Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, and Travis Barker more popularly known as Blink 182.  They were good before this, but this was their big debut to making them known better, (maybe it had something to do with the lesbian porn star on the cover.)   This is one of their best CDs with all the most famous songs, but I suggest buying The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show instead.  That's their concert CD from San Francisco made shortly after this one, and has all their best songs to date.  Either buy this or Mark, Tom, and Travis Show, but not both.
B000003S09|4.0|Progressive rock was a narrowly defined type of music, scarcely a genre in the late sixties. \\"Nights in White Satin\\" and \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" on a few radio stations, some leftovers from the British psychedelic/acid rock scene. That was about it. The instant that odd honking noise at the start of King Crimson's In the Court of the Crimson King ends and a brisk wave of jazz-enhanced hard rock and is let loose, all that is changed. For better and for worse, these London speakeasy favorites, each with eclectic musical instruction, birthed progressive rock in 1969. Rock and roll lovers, whose technical skills were more suited towards playing Bach than Berry and whose nights were spent at the library, not the juke joint, now had a circle to join. Forget that it led to so much hokey pomp (It also led to fine bands such as Queen and Smashing Pumpkins, btw) and listen to King Crimson's marvelous debut without prejudice. Its wintery jazz is genuinely calming (\\"I Talk to the Wind\\"), its scathing hard rock is thoroughly exciting and compelling (\\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\"), its fablebook mantras are evocative (the title song) and lyricist, Peter Sinfeld's powers of description are magnificent (\\"She's a moonchild/Gathering the flowers in a garden/Lovely moonchild/Drifting on the echoes of the hours/Sailing on the wind in a milk white gown/Dropping circle stones on a sun dial/Playing hide and seek with the ghosts of dawn/Waiting for a smile from a sun child\\"). If it were not for the tremendous amount of unstructured noodling at the end of \\"Moonchild,\\" In the Court of the Crimson King would be entirely unblemished. Unlike the experimental rockers who came before them, King Crimson had a definitive, blood red sci-fi vision and a clear goal of stretching the language and structures of rock past the popsong format and further. Even if they had never released another album, their mission would be complete.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is a terrific movie and a hallmark of American cinema. It has strong charecters, a good plot, awesome and exciting action sequences, a great music score, supreme acting, and great direction. I also enjoy the mega buck (eighty million dollor) sequel, but it's not nearly as strong as this masterwork. The second film is YES a very good movie. It one two more oscars than the first, and has supreme special effects, but the first film is much classier, and has much stronger charecters than T2. When Terminator 2 Judgement Day- The Ultimate Edition DVD was released, I bought it, and loved it, but said &quot;Doesn't anyone remember the first film? Doesn't anyone remember the one that started it?&quot; I always wished that a special edition of T1 would be made, and now, here it is! It's a great, brand new version, with Original Mono Sountrack, AND a brand new- Dolby Dighital 5.1 version that adds so much to the expeirence. The explosions and gunshots are not just louder, but they sound completely different. The 45 longslide with laser sighting is comletely different. It sounds a lot like it has a silencer on it. Also, the explosions are much more detailed, in terms of sound. The part where that truck explodes sounds comletely different. Basically everything does. I know that there's propably someone out there who's thinking &quot;Why does everyone love this new version? I love the original, the way it was seen in theatres.&quot; If you're that person, they have, as I said, the original mono. As for special features, it's not nearly as packed and jammed as the second film is, but it's enough to satisfy me. The two documentarys are &quot;The Terminator- A Retrospective&quot;, where James Cameran and Arnold Schwarzenegger sit and talk about memories. It's very nice. The other (more informative) documentary is &quot;Other Voices&quot;, where lots of the actors and crew talk about the making of the film, from script to final cut and release. This one's got more infoabout the making, and was very interesting. You also get four trailers (I like the foreing one) and a still gallery, as well as seven &quot;Terminated&quot; scenes. Most of the scenes are just tiny little bits, but some are interesting. I was surprised that the scenes weren't restored back into the movie, but none of them are really crucial to the story. There are two scenes that are longer. One is where we watch a man take the chip from the crushed terminator and put it in his pocket, we then learn the building the terminator was crushed in was Cyberdyne. The next is one where Sarrah suggests to Reese that they blow Cyberdyne up, and a big fight and all ensues, leading to Reese crying because the trees and grass are so beautiful, and in his world they're all gone. Cool.<br />Now, for the hidden stuff. I thank reviwer alan5973 for telling me the hidden stuff. But, his reveiw's way back, and I don't think anyone's going to look at it. So, here's what you do. On side one, the movie, you go to extra features and click DVD rom. When you get there, highlight Special Features, and type in 5 1 2 8 4 1. Then, you go to a two page thing with a bunch of interviews. Some of the things are interesting (William Wisher plays the cop in one scene, and in T2 he's the guy at the mall taking pictures). There's some cool stuff here. Thanks again alan5973! Anyway, in addition to the new sound on the movie, you get the proper widescreen (1:85:1) format to show everything you're meant to see. The picture quality is sharp and good, unlike the awful Hemdale DVD with no features. That picture was unbearable! This picture's very good though! My only complaint is, couldn't James Cameron do a commentary for the whole movie? He does on the deleted footage, and it would be nice to have a whole commentary. Aside from that (and the fact the deleted footage wasn't restored to the movie itself) this is one great DVD that I recommend you buy. If you have the horrid older disk, trash it. Get the special edition!<br />If you found my review helpful, please don't forget to give me a vote! Thanks a whole lot!<BR> <BR>The Terminator is Rated R For Some Graphic Violence, Gore, Bad Language, Thematic Elements, Breif Nudity, and A Sex Scene.
B00001OH7Y|4.0|Scary Monsters reads like a letter from David Bowie to his fans, not one of thanks or appreciation, but one of cynicism, helplessness and appeal for understanding. Don't worry, it is not as self-indulgent as it sounds. 1980's Scary Monsters is less the sound of a narcissistic ego-driven rock star, begging for sympathy, but that of a man stuck in a dreadful limbo between youth and middleage. While most men of thirty-three were slowing down into comfortable domestication, Bowie is expected ro continually rock the boat of popular culture. \\"Same old thing in brand new drag/Comes sweeping into view/As ugly as a teenage millionaire/Pretending it's a whiz kid world/You'll take me aside, and say/`Well, David, what shall I do?/They wait for me in the hallway'/I'll say `Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways'/But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner/I feel like a group of one/No, No They can't do this to me/I'm not some piece of teenage wildlife\\" he expresses on \\"Teenage Wildlife.\\" The proto-industrial title track, about the destruction a groupie's psyche, the sarcastic \\"Because You're Young\\" and both the screaming \\"It's No Game Part 1\\" and the sedated \\"It's No Game Part 2,\\" featuring lyrics questioning celebrity-obsessed, tragedy-blind Western society, tread along similiar themes. Others tracks do as well, in less apparent ways. The androidic \\"Fashion\\" cutely mocks its own subject matter and in the gorgeous \\"Ashes to Ashes,\\" Bowie not only tells of the death of his popular character, Major Tom, first mentioned eleven years earlier in Bowie's first hit, \\"Space Oddity,\\" but also reveals him to be a drug addict. It is a move that symbolizes the death of Bowie's youth and the denial of the purity of youth. The music that backs Bowie's words is a clean-cut, thickly textured, proto-new-wave sound. Scary Monsters' instrumental backing is one of shimmering keyboards and either crunching guitar riffs (\\"It`s No Game Part 1\\" or \\"Scary Monsters\\") and or more soaring guitar work (\\"Teenage Wildlife\\" or \\"Kingdom Come\\"), provided mostly by guitar-texture extraordinaire, Robert Fripp. Doing a similar job as that of fellow music experimenter, Brian Eno, who backed Bowie's tongue-tied frustration on 1977's Low, Robert Fripp provides both the claws and the open ended musical wanderings to give a finely construed musical dimension to the expressions of Scary Monsters. The sad clown version of Bowie seen on the cover had much to say about his position. Growing older and feeling like pop culture's puppet, Bowie skillfully lets his frustration loose on Scary Monsters.
0780626966|5.0|I was young when these movies first hit theaters and they scared the living daylights out of me. The only one that still does is the original Nightmare, where Freddy talks less and theres more suspense. However the sequels each have their share of frightening moments. Freddy's Revenge, in my opinion is the weakest of all, with terrible acting and embarrassing incidents where a parrot goes nuts and becomes a flying fireball, and a high school coach's death by (gasp!) a towel smack!! The Dream Warriors, the third sequel is excellent in my opinion, with better writing and compelling action scenes. Zsa Zsa Gabor is way more scarier than Freddy! That t.v. scene is unforgettable. The Dream Master is an ok sequel, excusing the dog urine that revived Freddy. The death scenes were at their most eccentric; turning a bug-squashing fitness freak into a cockroach and being thrown into a roach motel, and the danger of french kissing. The Dream Child goes back to the darkness of the original, but it still doesnt hold a candle to it. It is creepy nevertheless, what with the unborn baby storyline and all. Freddy's Dead (or so we think, MooooHHAAAAAHHAA) in the sixth film where we meet not only Fred's father, but his daughter. A good background info kinda movie, that contains the usual black comedy/fright moments. The giant Q-tip: what was up with that? The collection includes 3-D glasses for the ending fight sequence, which is pretty good,but like the others, Freddys not dead just taking a nap for another year or two until the next film. Wes Craven's New Nightmare is the best sequel, and it only took a decade to make. Freddy jumps from the screen and into the real world to destroy the people that made him and to terrorize Heather L. who played the tormented Nancy in 1 and 3. Good writing and scarier than the previous five, the film was very well received in the mid 90s, a time where we thought hed never be back at the movies. This collection is worth every penny for all the extras you get. New generations may find it a bit cheesy and dated, but 80s kids like me know they were the best of the genre of that time. I was always fascinated with dreams and the two world/parallel universe thing is the cool part about the series. Definitely a must have.
B000002I2I|4.0|The Doors did not react to fame easily. After hitting #1 in 1967 with \\"Light My Fire,\\" the band was both embraced and mocked by audiences. Their albums sold well but were critically denigrated. Lead singer, Jim Morrison, was considered a visionary/poet but was also featured in teen magazines. Likewise, their work became full of contradictions. The Doors' albums featured both blatant attempts at the top 10 (\\"Hello I Love You,\\" \\"Touch Me\\") and winding, complicated epics (\\"When the Music's Over,\\" \\"The Soft Parade\\"), both simple love songs (\\"We Could Be So Good Together,\\" \\"You Make Me Real\\") and bloody timepieces (\\"Five to One,\\" \\"The Unknown Solider\\"). The Doors' fifth album, 1970's Morrison Hotel may be their first with direction. It is a return to their roots. Psychedelic musings, a smoldering blues sound and skittish guitar playing mix together in one immense, leather-clad, California highway-roaming, rolling stone of an album. Morrison Hotel begins with the unequaled bluesrock commotion of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" and scarcely settles down. Only the beautifully breezy, \\"Indian Summer\\" and the slinky \\"The Spy\\" interrupt its embodiment of all that is good about prepunk hard rock. In a cool, masculine, dead serious tone, Jim Morrison sings of highway queens, pirates and blood on the streets. Robbie Krieger's rupturing guitar is taken out of the background with excellent results. His feral riffs define \\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" \\"Land Ho!\\" and especially \\"Maggie M'Gill.\\" Although, their career would not last much longer, Morrison Hotel undoubtedly brought the Doors back on the right track. It was their most enthralling and strongest effort to date.
0679720200|4.0|A quick and very light book to read...I liked Camus style of writing and the way he delivers his message to the reader. His writing makes you think of what exactly the characters are going through, why do they act in certain ways, and how similar are we to all that...<br />The book takes you through bizzare situations, each one is unique in its own way, but each one has a lesson behind it...
B00004Z459|5.0|I love the blend or metal and rap. I think its insulting to compare them to Limp Bizkit because he doesn't even come close to the origionality and variety of sounds that Linkin Park has. My only problem is that the songs are too short and the album is too short. They need a follow-up release if there going to last. Also, I think people who bad-mouth the rapper need to stop. He is great! The songs that feature the rapper seem to have more of an edge while the singer adds a strange melodic anger that works well. GET THIS CD and tell them to make more!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The DVD actually out does the theatrical version. The extended ending gave me belly laughs and the extras are worth 5 stars by themselves. I'd agree that Shrek lacks the sweetness of Toy Story but it more than makes up for that with its visual and verbal barbs aimed everywhere (The Matrix, Disney, Snow White, classic rock songs, fairytales, etc.). Shrek manages to spoof a number of genres all within less than two hours.<br />The dual disc release is a great way to cram as many extras on without sacrificing picture quality. The second disc has a director commentary that's both fun and enlightening. Additional extras are animation tests and a DVD rom game. Including both the widescreen and full screen versions is perfect for this family; I prefer the widescreen films to the pan and scanned versions while my wife and kids prefer the full screened. We're both kept happy in the process.<br />The picture quality is crisp, sharp and has a depth that is at times startling. The sound mix is great whether you're watching it on your television or in DTS. Kudos to Dreamworks for putting together another winner and for pulling out all the stops for this entertaining film.
0345350499|5.0|I had a brief background in Arthurian legend from an Anglo-Saxon Lit class, so I was quite interested in understanding more of the feminist slant in their retelling. I bought this book after seeing the TNT movie version, expecting (of course) to find differences between it and the book. While I did not think that I would find as many as I did, the differences were wonderful. _Mists_ is an extremely well-written book that grabs its readers, pulls them in, and doesn't let go until you finish reading the last page. As soon as I finished reading this book, I wanted to start reading it again.<br />_Mists_ is not only a retelling of Arthurian legend, not only a tale expressing the dangers of human frailty. _Mists_ offers its readers a view of religion that I personally find extremely refreshing and liberating: no matter what name a religion gives to its higher power--be it God, Allah, Yahweh--the importance is believing in a God who reaches across religious lines and semantics to be involved in a human life. And in that same vein, it shows the dangers in confusing a higher power's intentions and our own human wishes...things I think it would do most people good to remember when desparaging remarks enter their minds.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If you haven't purchased this DVD, you need to run out and get it because not only is it hilarious but it also has some great special features. Especially if you have a DVD-Rom drive in your computer. You can play all sorts of games on your DVD-Rom drive plus you can actually do voiceovers for the characters in the scenes.  The movie is the best animated movie I have ever seen. With a cast of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow and Cameron Diaz you can't go wrong with the voices.  They do a wonderful job and make the movie great.
B000001A3H|5.0|personally, this is my favorite Kyuss album and absolutely one of the must-have rock records.  The sound contained here is unique, it is a gorgeous scintillating and solar sound, a sound you never heard anywhere else before, loud and melodic, raw and yet soothing. No other bands comes close, and many bands have been inspired by the sounds from &quot;blues for the red sun&quot;: this is a testament to importance of this record - espescially in the light of Kyuss' debut album &quot;wretch&quot;.
B00000IQB7|3.0|There is just something about this movie, every time it is on, I have to watch it. It has an excellent plot but it could have been done much better.<br />A high school kid needs to get an A on his Science project to pass so he goes to an old air force junk yard to look for something to tinker with. He finds an underground storage facility no longer in use. an odd light catches his attention. Security is soon on his tale. He grabs the object and runs. Know one is quite sure with it is, but it is an engine from an alien space craft.  when he starts to play with it, all hell breaks loose as time and space are unraveled.
6305079900|5.0|This was the premiere movie that thrust Arnold into the spot-<br />light of action film heroes. A cyborg is sent from the future to<br />kill a woman who is the mother of a soon to be resistance leader on planet earth in the near future. The cyborg is absolutely<br />frightening. He kills everything in his path trying to get at the mother. The result is some of the best special effects you will ever see in a movie. Action in this movie is nonstop as well<br />as breathtaking. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat. Arnold is the dominant force in this film. This is one of the best action movies you will ever see. You wonder after each scene if the future mother will survive. Watch this movie. You<br />will enjoy it.
0783230710|5.0|For anyone that did not grow up in this era of space travle, this is a must see. It starts a little slow, but it quickly gets good. Just to get a glimps of what these asttonauts where really going through back in this time is unbelievable. They really never knew if they would survive untill they where back on earth. The movie could not be any more realistic.<br />Three astronts start on what has become to most people a routine mission to the moon. It quickly becomes anything but routine when an explosion criples the space craft. As the space craft is quickly losing power, N.A.S.A. must find a way to get them back home. problem after problem threatens their servival, and even if they do make it back, they do not know if they will survive the re-entry.
B00005QIPH|5.0|When I first played the Strokes my first thought was the same as the albums title. On the second listen the real energy began to surface and by listen three I was well and truly hooked. Great lyrics, laid back guitars,and an energy similar to the New York Dolls the Strokes are a band that make you feel good, make you want to get up and move and who you just can't help but love to listen to.The songs are infectious and fun and stick in your mind well after you have switched the Cd off.A great success in England - shame you guys can't have the original cover sleeve -much more fun than the US version!!
6305971935|3.0|I have always been fascinated by this true story. Yes, thats right, TRUE!. Of course in this movie, there was a lot of exaggeration. The ship really did disapear. but beyond that not to many people know what els happend. there are rumors of experimenting with time travle, and rumors that the ship reapeared in norfolk virginia, and the rumors only get bigger after that. But this did happen, My father worked at the ship yard and witness the generators being installed on the ship. <br />the year is 1943, and the navy is trying a new type of stealth technology for ships. It is supposed to make the ship invisible to radar. When the generators are turned on, the entire ship disapears from view. Meanwile, in 1984, the same technology is being used to make a deserted town dissappear. Somehow a rift is opened between the two times. Two crewmen jump of the ship and land in 1984. The two crewman get to experience 1984, but one of them is pulled back thought time. The rift will not close, the generators on the ship are still running keeping it open. when the other crewman is found, he is used to shut down the genorators on the ship. If you havent seen this movie, it is worth watching. If you liked The Final Count Down, you will probably like this movie.
B000059R8Y|5.0|This album is Clapton at his best. I wasn't sure what to expect after his &quot;Pilgrim&quot; album. Maybe more in that vein, but no. This is Clapton at his bluesy best. A great mix of originals and covers, including Ray Charles &quot;Come back Baby&quot;, Stevie Wonder's &quot;I aint gonna stand for it&quot;, and J.J.Cale's &quot;Travellin' Light&quot;.  Every song on here is a good song...no filler, I just can't find anything that isn't good on this album. Even after all these years, Clapton still has it, and is just as good as he ever was. The 12 page booklet includes an introduction by EC, and loads of photos. A must for all Clapton fans.
B00000K19E|5.0|The plot alone is outstanding, but the movie is also done very well.  I love movies with a twist, and this has a great one. This movie is famous for the special effects, they have been copied a million times since, but they are still good.<br />A computer wiz is leading a double life, He has his normal day job, and is a computer hacker by night. He thinks he is one of the best but because of his insight into the world of computers, he finds there is some kind of conspericy happening, bigger than anyone knows. Another hacker invites him to find out what it is. He accepts the invition. He is givin a choice to go back to his normal life, or to find out what the matrix is. If he takes the second choice, his life will never be the same again. The reality he learns of is so unreal that he wishes he never found out about it, but unable to return, he must join the battle against an evil with unbelievable power.
B00005KHL0|5.0|Of coarse not! there are tons of sequels. But did you know Friday the 13th has 10 sequels? I think thats the most. Halloween was originally called the &quot;Babysitting Murders&quot; but changed to Halloween. This film is about a killer (maniac) named Michael Myers who killed when he was little and got placed in a phycho home. A lot of years later when he was grown, he was released which was a big mistake. If I'm not mistaken, there are tons more sequels and it ends in Halloween H20
B00004VVNB|3.0|I love the plot of this movie, It is a long movie, so it is hard to watch over and over, but if you like Sci-Fi, then you will like Logans Run. If you can get past the 70's look of the film, the plot is excellent.<br />There has been a nucular war, and many generations of people have lived in this self contained paridise. no one has been out side for hundreds of years. The only problem is population control. In order to keep the population down, at the age of 30 you must be killed. The killings have been made into a celibration that people gladly go to and sacrafice there life. But some don't, Some try and Run, but no one has ever escaped untill now.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I just bought the DVD, and this is the first time I've seen the Shrek movie. WOW!!! Aside from the non-stop laughs the movie provided and the incredible visuals, and a super soundtrack, this  DVD is packed end to end with extras!! Just the way I like 'em!<br />It includes videos, Behind the scenes clips, lots of playable games for both the standard DVD players and DVD-roms. Interviews with the cast AND Characters! And a Karaoke session that has to be seen! It would be impossible to list everything.<br />But I think the best bonus feature of all is the Shrek Voice Over that actually lets you add your voice to scenes. Either by yourself, or better yet, with a buddy or two, trying it out will have you laughing your heads off!! Not to mention really making you appreciate just how much work the actors put in.<br />If you have a PC with a DVD you MUST get this movie!!<br />&quot;.....and in the morning, I'm making waffles!&quot; LOL!!
B00003Q438|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, I had no Idea what I was going to see. It just happend to be the only movie in the theater that I hadn't seen.  I was blown away! On the edge of my seat for three hours that seemed like only one. <br />A Trident missle submarine is sunk is deep water by an unknown craft. A hurricane is on the surface so rescue teams cannot reach it. There is an experimental underwater drilling rig within reach. a navy seal team is sent down to take charge, but the drilling team does not like to take orders.  the Sub sits on the edge of an abyss that goes 3 miles strait down. While searching the sub for survivors, another craft is spotted. The navy guys go crazy because they think it must be the Russians. But the Drilling crew disagree. Needless to say, it is not the Russians. I don't want to give away the ending, but this movies just gets more and more intense all the way though.  I didn't really care for the added scenes in the Special Eddition. if you get this movie watch the movie version first.
B00005QHPQ|3.0|I love Enrique Iglesias, I have his &quot;Cosas Del Amor&quot;, &quot;The Best Hits&quot;, &quot;Enrique&quot; and now &quot;Escape&quot;.  I found his latest release &quot;Escape&quot; to be too mainstream too much like English pop with too much electronic beat in the background.  I liked &quot;Enrique&quot; better-- more of a latin influence even though it is an English release.  I still enjoy &quot;Escape&quot; but I would have liked more latin influence and more ballads.  All that electronic noise hides his beautiful, sensitive, romantic voice.  By the way that is coming from an English speaking person--I don't understand a word of his Spanish but I love it.<br />Also Enrique is gorgeous, sexy what is he doing with that awful cap on in the video and the pictures included in the CD?  I say lose the cap!!  Love the Hero video--when is he going to release a DVD of a concert or even a music video compilation--come on Ricky Martin has a few out already!!
B00003CXFG|2.0|This movie is pretty good, but the hard thing for me is that just about the whole movie is very dark.  If you like horror combined with Sci-fi, then you probably will like it. <br />A group of people are stranded on a planet. the only way off is to hike accrost this barrin wastland to get to another space camp. unfortunitly, this planet is loaded with flesh eating creatures. The slightest light will keep them away, but stray out of the light, and you are instant dinner for these huge powerfull creatures.
6302732875|5.0|It doesn't take a movie connoisseur to see that this is a stage play filmed.  So what?  The play is a work of genius--it won a Pulitzer Prize--and the cast is about as good as you can get.  Jack Lemmon gives a performance that will tear your heart out...well, if you're like any of the characters in the play, you have no heart!  And Al Pacino gets to put the pedal to the metal and fire on all cylinders.  He is great when he's screaming, and he's even better when he's handing out buddy-buddy BS philosophy.  Kevin Spacey as John Williamson, the boss of the boiler room crew, has the skin of a rhino and the heart of a baboon.  Incidentally, the language is foul, fouler and foulest, and indeed, poor David Mamet, who wrote the play and adapted it for the screen, ran out of expletives.  I mean how many ways can you suggest that someone perform impossible acts upon themselves?  Yet, considering the moral fiber of the characters, the language seemed not inappropriate.<br />Indeed, Mamet is a master of dialogue and some of the set pieces are just marvels.  The exchange between Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) as Moss leads up to his plan to steal the precious \\"leads\\" is like a ping pong match done as a pas de deux.  And the harangue by Alec Baldwin as the brass...endowed motivational speaker was a crack up.<br />This is an extraordinarily intense film, so intense if you watch carefully you can see first Jack Lemmon and then Al Pacino so fired up and wildly expressive that spit comes out of their mouths along with the words.  (I've done that.)  In fact, all the actors feed off of one another.  Being on the set must have been just an amazing experience with everyone trying to outdo everyone else.  The timing alone is worth the ticket.<br />Note that no women grace the screen.  I mean zero.  This is a war flick with con artists in the trenches.  Note also how carefully plotted the story is.  Mamet thought it out and worked and reworked it so that everything fits.  For example when \\"The Machine\\" Levene makes his little slip revealing that he knew that the Roma contract had not been sent, we can immediately fill in the details realizing that Dave Moss had gotten to him with his cowardly scheme.  And when Levene learns that his miraculous $82,000 sale is to crazies who have no money and just like to talk to salesmen, we see how perfectly ironic that is, and how tragic, like the life of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman.  We can also see, if we really want to look beyond the movie, that Jack Lemmon's interpretation of Levene owes something to Willy Loman as does Mamet's creation.  I have seen Jack Lemmon in many things, beginning with Mr. Roberts (1955) through Some Like It Hot (1959) to Grumpy Old Men (1993) and he has been wonderful, one of the great stars of the silver screen, but I don't think I've ever seen him more convincing than here.  All the other actors in this film also have done larger pieces and had more demanding roles, but I'll bet they seldom had more fun.<br />You don't want to miss this movie.  It is one of a kind.

0451196716|5.0|I have read many of Stephen King's books and I believe that Richard Bachman brings out the best in him. The Long Walk is the best book ever written in the entire world. I loved it. It's written in the eyes of a 16 year old boy so you get a feel of a 16 year old guy's wants and needs. Ray Garraty is in the contest where you have to &quot;walk out&quot; 99 other guys before you can get your prize. If you get three warnings, you get your ticket: death. I've finished reading it for the third time and every time I read something that I missed the time before. This is the only book you'll ever need cuz after you read it, you won't want to read any other book.
B000035Z3K|4.0|Universal's 1931 film version of Bram Stoker's DRACULA stands as a milestone of cinematic horror mainly because it is the film that firmly established the mythos and iconography of the eponymous Count and his later vampiric progeny.  In addition to Bela Lugosi's contribution to the persona of Dracula himself--attributes that specifically include the thick Hungarian accent, the aristocratic demeanor, and the bizarre hand gestures and facial expressions--the film was the first to solidly identify vampires with things like bats, dark and musty gothic settings, and strong sexual undertones.  (Some may argue that these elements of the mythos were established by Murnau's NOSFERATU when it was released nearly ten years earlier.  However, due to legal problems over copyright disputes with Stoker's estate, NOSFERATU did not actually enjoy wide distribution or significant public attention until a few years after Universal's DRACULA.)<br />Although Lugosi's performance as Dracula is top-notch and Dwight Frye energetically chews the scenery as the Count's insane servant Renfield, most of the supporting performances are stagey or stilted.  Part of this is due to the fact that the script was lifted almost verbatim from a popular Broadway stage production of a few years earlier, and consequently there are times when the movie feels as if director Tod Browning and cinematographer Karl Freund simply filmed the stage production from the audience's vantage point.  In addition, it is evident that Browning's directing style was formed during Hollywood's silent era, as several scenes that could certainly profit from use of the spoken word instead feature turgid gestural performances.  (To be fair, it must be pointed out that some of the creepier scenes are so successful as such primarily BECAUSE of the emphasis on the visual, and this ability to communicate an emotion or feeling without the benefit of dialogue can certainly be attributed to Browning's experience working in silent films.)  Some modern viewers will be nonplussed by the nearly total lack of a background musical score--a common characteristic of early &quot;talkie&quot; films--though many horror aficionados agree that this provides an eerie dimension to these older flicks that simply contributes to their superiority over certain modern horror films.<br />In short, mature audiences and serious genre fans will probably enjoy this film, but the younger, more casual crowd may find it a bit rough going.<br />The DVD version of DRACULA has several cool bonus features, the most exciting of which is the complete Spanish-language version of the movie (English subtitles are available).  Filmed concurrently on the same sets but with a different cast and crew, the Spanish version is in many ways superior the more famous English edition.  Of course, actor Carlos Villar&iacute;as, in the title role, does not quite equal the stage presence of Lugosi, but the supporting cast does an outstanding job--especially actresses Lupita Tovar and Carmen Guerrero, who are sexier and much more affecting than their English-speaking counterparts.  Additionally, the cinematography is very dynamic and fluid--not stiff and mostly static like Freund's--and many of the special effects are creepier and more realistic and believable.  This version of DRACULA is necessary viewing for any horror fan, especially those who hold vampires at the top of the monster pantheon, and Universal should be commended for including it as part of the English-version DVD.Some modern viewers will be nonplussed by the nearly total lack of a background musical score--a common characteristic of early &quot;talkie&quot; films--though many horror aficionados agree that this provides an eerie dimension to these older flicks that simply contributes to their superiority over certain modern horror films.  <br />In short, mature audiences and serious genre fans will probably enjoy this film, but the younger, more casual crowd may find it a bit rough going.<br />The DVD version of DRACULA has several cool bonus features, the most exciting of which is the complete Spanish-language version of the movie (English subtitles are available).

B000002C2E|5.0|Electric Troubadour?, or Folk Judas? Lucky man in the right place at the right time? Or the most creative genius to ever lend a hand to Rock `n' Roll? This dog certainly leans the way of immortal rock pioneer.<br /> The Dylan legend was created in a burst of creativity in the early sixties, which saw the writing of many of his most famous songs, from \\"Blowin In The Wind\\", via \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\", and \\"Just Like A Woman\\", to \\"All Along The Watch Tower\\".<br /> Here in lies the answer to the questions, does he still matter?, Can the man still cut it? For what makes Dylan important and unique, and so far above the inanity of Paul McCartney or Mick Jagger's gaucherine, is that he continues in his efforts to bring meaningful expression from his life, even as time rolls past, this year Dylan reaches sixty, will this be the end of an era or the start of something new? And such on going engagement is the sign of a truly great artist. The ability to change and change your audience is certainly the mark of a leader.<br /> His last studio album, \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" (1997) (He has been out on the road touring incessantly since it's release, finding himself more at home on tour now than he has ever been.) was a huge critical success winning all the categories in which he was nominated, including album of the year at the 1998 Grammy's. Not bad for an old man eh \\"Boyzone\\".<br /> Artistically Dylan is now at the top of his game, playing with more vim &amp; vigour than has been shown for many a year. Then again it is peculiarly misguided to treat Dylan albums as one-off events. Listening to his work is more like taking the Siberian Express, where the scenery, is sometimes startling, sometimes rough, even shabby occasionally, but most importantly always demanding your attention. Most tracks on \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" are as good as anything Dylan has done before, and often surpassing some of his slightly dodgy work in the eighties. These songs in typical Dylan style are restless, dissenting, wrathful, lonely, but heartfelt in their effort to drag a bit of reality out of feelings created over the last six decades, in his emotional way to add some truth out of long experience.<br /> Things have changed of course over the years, these days on stage he dresses eccentrically, a cross between a gentleman dandy from Mississippi and a gun slinging Texan cowboy dressed in black, he is less the young poet and more like an old testament prophet come down from the mountain to cry out - in a voice as cracked as the tablets which he throws to the ground - the soothsayer of human affairs.<br /> But the description that definetly still does pertain to Dylan - as it always will - is that of protest singer, the voice of his subjects. Not in the narrow, liberal - baby - boomer - turned - pillar - of - society sense of complaining on behalf good causes, but as a man who consistently dissents from, disapproves of and inveighs against this vulgar forlorn age in which we live, Bob Dylan is an articulate man whose proclamations on \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" are worth hearing. As Dylan sings in \\"Not Dark Yet\\" probably one of the most disturbing songs on this collection.<br /> \\"I was born here and I'll die here against my will<br />  I know it looks like I'm moving but I'm standing still.<br />  Every nerve in my body is so vacant &amp; numb<br />  I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from<br />  Don't even hear a murmur of a prayer<br />  It's not dark yet, but it's getting there\\"<br />If that isn't protest, then what is?<br />Mott the Dog.hful, lonely, but heartfelt in their effort to drag a bit of reality out of feelings created over the last six decades, in his emotional way to add some truth out of long experience. <BR> Things have changed of course over the years, these days on stage he dresses eccentrically, a cross between a gentleman dandy from Mississippi and a gun slinging Texan cowboy dressed in black, he is less the young poet and more like an old testament prophet come down from the mountain to cry out - in a voice as cracked as the tablets which he throws to the ground - the soothsayer of human affairs.<BR> But the description that definetly still does pertain to Dylan - as it always will - is that of protest singer, the voice of his subjects.

B00005OWIU|5.0|I got the new soundtrack and I love it.  Williams certainly maintains the more &quot;dark&quot; mood of the movie in this soundtrack.  The motive is catchy and fitting.  I feel it's reminiscent of &quot;Home Alone&quot; with the sort of techno chimes and thier eerie but beautiful sounds.  Some may say it only has instrumental, but I think this is a great strength.  It doesn't need words.  The music does the perfect job all by itself.
630512695X|5.0|This musical is not for everyone, but i know plenty of people who as a general rule don't like musicals, but loved this one.  Even without the music, the plot itself is hilarious and masterfully carried out through the acting.  The songs are great, and the dancing superb.  Some parts seem a little random and odd, but it only serves to contribute more to the overall theme and mood of the peice.  I forget the name of Gene Kelly's sidekick in this film, but he is one of the best reasons to watch the movie (besides Gene Kelly and Deborah Reynolds).<BR>The ending is the icing on the cake, and is a hilarious ending to a great show.
0780020685|5.0|&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is one of those movies your hear referred to constantly by full-time film afficionados. Those are the kinds of movies I'm usually leery of. Finally I broke down and rented &quot;Seven Samurai,&quot; and found it to be well worth the praise-indeed, worthy of its position as one of the all-time great movies. The story is a rousing one, the cinematography instantly affecting. I liked the dvd so much I purchased a copy.  I appreciate Criterion's decision to have commentary from a full-fledged Japanese film fan. He knows the material inside out and provides a wealth of small details, as well as appreciative remarks that no director would feel comfortable making. Highly recommended.
B00003CX5P|5.0|even if you didn't like the movie compared to the previous Starwars flicks, if you are a hardcore star wars fan you basically have to buy this DVD.  If you don't know why, then your not a hardcore starwars fan (not that there is anything wrong with that).
0671027344|5.0|I read this book at the beginning of last year. It was one of the best books I have read, I listened to his song 'Asleep' by The Smiths, and in a way I felt connected to Charlie. Charlie is one of those characters that you really wish was an actual person, and that you had the priviledge of knowing. The style is of a minimalistic nature yet effective in conveying the traumas of adolescence. Stephen Chbosky has captures the essence of youth on paper, and I look forward to reading his other work.
0881030376|5.0|John Steinbeck wrote this classic gem in 1937.  It's been a Broadway play and there have been several adaptations of it in movies and TV.  I was generally familiar with the story but this was the first time I actually read the book.  Wow!  I was completely blown away!  This is the story of a two lonely and alienated men who work as farm laborers, drifting from job to job in California.  Lennie is gentle giant, physically strong but mentally retarded.  George guides and protects Lennie but also depends on him for companionship.  Together, they have a dream to someday buy a little farm where they can grow crops and raise rabbits and live happily ever after. This, of course, is not to be as the title suggests.  &quot;The best laid plans of mice and men&quot; is a line in a poem by Robert Burns, which describes how a field mouse's world is destroyed by a plow.<br />Steinbeck's narrative voice is seemingly simple in his descriptions of nature of as well as the details of the bunkhouse.  His characterizations of the people are magnificent.  We meet the other workers, all loners, and appreciate the beauty of the unique friendship between Lennie and George.  We meet Candy, the old man who is outliving his usefulness.  We meet Crooks,  the black stable hand, shunned by the men and therefore turning to books for  companionship.  We meet the cruel Curley who taunts Lennie into a fight.  And we meet Curley's wife, another lonely soul who uses her femininity to get the wrong kind of attention.<br />There's tension in every word and I found myself holding my breath, knowing that something awful would happen, my eyes glued to the page, the world of Lennie and George deeply etched into my consciousness.  I was pulled right into the story, wanting to shout warnings as I saw the inevitable consequences. The ending was incredibly sad, but yet satisfying. It couldn't have ended any other way.  It's a small book, only 118 pages long.  But it is a masterpiece and I will never forget it.  I give it my highest recommendation.I give it my highest recommendation.
6305972591|3.0|Before watching this movie, remember you are going to see an adaptation from a few-pages-long story by Stephen King, performed during the late eighties, when horror movies were the main attraction to young teenagers.<BR>The movie is ridiculous, even if the story is pretty interesting. There are few moments of suspance, but actors aren't really there. It's a kind of a B-movie, with a solid background and incredibly low quality effects.<BR>Anyway, it's interesting to see and to have, as the sign of a very different age.<BR>The DVD is quite well mastered. Images are very noisy because of film grain, but otherwise consistent. Contrast is quite low, and this makes colours a bit washed out.<BR>The sound is a multichannel remix from Chase, encoded in DD 5.1. Anyway dialogues are quite dated and so are the effects. Basses are too boomy and the soundfield collapses too often into the center channel.<BR>The extras are very limited: there's a small booklet and a trailer. That's it.
B00003CXE7|4.0|The DVD version of &quot;Gladiator&quot; is very good, especially the director's commentary on the deleted scenes (some of which would have made the movie better, and in my opinon should have been left in the final version).<br />&quot;Gladiator&quot; is overall a fine film, with good actors, good dialogue, and a nice screenplay. The visual recreation of the Roman world of the 2nd century is thoroughly convincing and sometimes breathtaking, especially the opening battle sequence, which alone is worth buying the DVD for. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, as always, is excellent.<br />Seen as the struggle of one man, Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls from Roman general to gladiator and slave, the plot is quite strong and moving, apart from the many excellent action scenes.<br />From the historical point of view, the movie is very flawed. Its starting point is a momentous event - the death of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and the accession of his unworthy son Commodus, which was seen by ancient and modern historians as the beginning of the empire's long decline. This same starting point had already been used in &quot;Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; in 1963, hence the similaraties between both movies, already noted elsewhere.<br />But, while &quot;Fall&quot; did its best to remain at least partially faithful to historical events (getting ever less so towards the end), &quot;Gladiator&quot; uses the historical background but messes it up considerably. <br />The main problems I have with &quot;Gladiator&quot;, historically, are:<br />- the characterization of Commodus. The historical Commodus was a sports fanatic and a superb athlete, who wasn't too bad a gladiator himself. He was an eccentric tyrant, possibly even mad, and devoted himself to pleasure while his minions governed the empire - but he was a very different person from that portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, who's more of a &quot;problem kid&quot;. The real Commodus is not known to have incestuous designs on his sister Lucilla -he banished her to Capri and had her killed there afterwards, fairly early in this reign.<br />- the idea that Marcus Aurelius might have thoughts about removing Commodus from the succession is probably wrong, but not too implausible. The idea that he might have planned to restore the Republic is preposterous. Any such attempt would almost certainly have plunged the empire into civil war, which is also why the historical Marcus actually did what he could to ensure that Commodus's position would be unassailable (since a rumor that Marcus had died 5 years earlier did indeed start a short-lived civil war), even though he was only 19 when Marcus died.<br />- On this subject, someone says &quot;Rome was founded as a republic&quot;. No, it was founded as a monarchy ruled by kings; only some 250 years later did it become a republic - and some 480 years later an &quot;empire&quot;.<br />- Maximus is portrayed as a &quot;general&quot; of the whole army in Germania, but who had never been in Rome. In Marcus's reign that would have been impossible - anyone in such a position would also have to belong to the senatorial class, and therefore have spent at least part of his career in Rome. &quot;Generals&quot; in the sense that Maximus was did not exist. However, people like Maximus did appears a few decades after Marcus's death.<br />- Finally, the real Commodus was murdered in a palace conspiracy, strangled in his bath by his sparring partner, after 12 years as emperor. After 2 short-lived successors, the empire plunged into civil war, after which the victor, Septimius Severus, emerged as sole emperor.<br />What I mean is that &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a very good film, but bad history. Which is fine - if one is aware of that.
B00005A46T|1.0|The Drumming is the only saving grace, but Joey is wasting his talent. If you are a teenage suburban white male with a lot of anger then this may be for you, but it still sucks. This will sell to children throught lyrics alone, they are quite immature, usually about hating someone or something, or violence, or about evil or sometihn(&quot;If your 555 then i'm 666...&quot; what is that supposed to mean?) Most kids will think its cool to evil like that, or will think they are hardcore since they haven't ever heard any real metal, jus limp bizkit. or perhaps they will think the masks make them a &quot;scary&quot; band to make their parents cringe. Well, one good thing about this album is that I know if I ever can't find a real job, I can get 8 of my friends, and yell and dance and beat the crap outa my instrument on a stage for a couple dollars.
B000002UB3|5.0|To start things off, if you don't own this album already you are missing out on one the greatest albums ever recorded. The album is full of great songs! From classics that eveyone should know like &quot;come together&quot;,&quot;something&quot;,and &quot;here comes the sun&quot; to &quot;you never give me your money&quot;,&quot;she came through the bathroom window&quot; and &quot;I want you(she's so heavy&quot; to name a few. But if your going to buy the album simply for the hits you should stick to the greatest hits album because you are not living the Beatles experience. It's hard to pick out certain songs from an album that is great straight through. In my opinion if you don't like this album you don't know what great rock is! You don't know what your missing.

6303695779|4.0|What astounds me about early and silent films is the frequent painterliness of the images you see on film.  The imagery of Symbolist painting seems especially conspicuous.  It seems obvious, for example, that Pastrone's -Cabiria- and D. W. Griffith's -Intolerance- bathed deep in the influence of Gustave Moreau.  Griffith's good girls seem sometimes to have stepped out of the canvases of Puvis de Chavannes or Burne-Jones.<br />This is a Scandinavian vampire film.  Where else would you look for visual references, than early Edvard Munch?  This is what jumps out at me in this film.  In the scenes with the vampire-contaminated girl on her sickbed, Dreyer seems to be wanting to recreate Munch's -The Sick Girl- and -Spring-.  The sister [?] in the castle seems to have been made up to look like a somewhat scrawny version of Inger Munch, the painter's sister, who modelled over and over again throughout the paintings.<br />Of course, expressionist movies and expressionist paintings naturally go along hand in hand.  This movie is somewhat hard to watch at times; the pacing is definitely odd and disorienting.  On the version I have, the subtitles are done in large black-letter script.  Fortunately, they do not often appear, and unlike the text insets are mostly irrelevant to what is going on.  This is basically a silent film with a soundtrack added.  The soundtrack cuts out at times.<br />Not for everybody, but not awful, either.
B00004U28G|1.0|This movie may cause death from severe boredom and/or depression at the knowledge that you PAID money for it. It is SO bad that I actually threw it out rather than resell it, in doing so I saved some innocent person from having this inflicted upon them. DO NOT BUY THIS!
B000021YQV|5.0|Although recorded in a matter of weeks you can tell System Of A Down has put their hearts into this album. With songs ranging from political hypocricy, to sex & suicide, you might think \\"oh just another (...) metal album\\", but that would be far from the truth. Take the song 'bounce'. In wich they cleverly candy coat the songs true message about sex, with lyrics about a kid and his pogo stick. Then they have their ballads like 'chop suey' and 'arials' wich are so gracefull you wouldnt expect the upcomming mindshaking metal. System has truly outdone themselves on this album. I hope that you will go out and get this album, its just so fantastic, & if they head to your town W/ Slipknot & Ramstein  On 'The Pledge Of Allegiance Tour', make sure your there, otherwise you are going to miss a MIND BLOWING concert

B00000DHRZ|3.0|When I heard &quot;I Choose&quot;, it was unlike any other Offspring song I had heard. Well, it carried over into this album, as I had thought. How disappointing. The intelligent themes of songs from &quot;Tehran&quot;, &quot;Get It Right&quot;, and &quot;Come Out and Play&quot; are nearly gone (if you like Offspring because of this CD, you'll have no idea about these songs). The guitars are bassier, which gives it a Blink 182 feel. Well, I'll get to the songs:<br />1) Intro-better than CO1, worse than the others. Stupid, too (familiar theme here)<br />2) Have You Ever-it's a good song until the interlude, and the second half of the song is totally unrelated. What happened?...6/10<br />3) Staring at the Sun-a truly awesome punk song. At first I didn't get it, but I read Dexter's thinking behind it, and now I get the lyrics. Guitar speeds through the song. 9/10<br />4) Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)-the low moment in the career of the Offspring. Not their worst song (you'll see), but the excruciating whining and the simple guitar is disappointing. The message is good, but the musical context is bad. 1/10<br />5) The Kids Aren't Alright-easily up there with the old hits such as &quot;Gotta Get Away&quot; and &quot;Self Esteem&quot;. The harsh truth about how kids with a bright future turn fall into the gutter. Awesome beginning, and then a cool riff and solo. 10/10<br />6) Feelings-cover of some group, a really shallow song, Dexter's vocal weakness is really heard in that song. Solo is good, though. 2/10<br />7) She's Got Issues-pure pop, but it's done well. Still, it's not punk, and Dexter really reaches to hit that top note. 5/10<br />8) Walla Walla-a song the Offspring never would have written in the true punk years, and at Woodstock, Dexter's like &quot;We wrote this song about prison 'cause prison's cool, right?&quot; Ack. Funny song, and a true statement in the song-&quot;In the scheme of life, we're all just brothers&quot;-but still, can't make up for the lack ofseriousness. 6/10<br />9) The End of the Line-&quot;Gone Away&quot; twisted by anger. I can't stand the guitar, it sounds so flat. All the echoing sounds is completely unlike the Offspring. 4/10<br />10) No Brakes-flat guitar, sounds so bland. I can barely understand anything Dexter is yelling. Way too high. 2/10<br />11) Why Don't You Get a Job-easily the worst Offspring song ever. Yeah, it's a play on the Beatles, but the Beatles did that kind of music. The Offspring do not. Dexter's vocals are whining, Noodle's guitar is nearly invisible and we have a FLUTE playing the main part. Bad stench. 0/10<br />12) Americana-kind of like Bad Habit, and that was awesome. Rips into the suburban life of America. Great song, and for you guitarists, it sounds like the only song the Offspring have ever played in drop-D. 8/10<br />13) Pay the Man-most people don't like it, but I do. Has a pretty long musical section, kind of dreamy rock. But then it kicks into punk mode. True, Dexter sings higher than usual, but I love it. It's true, we all pay a man in life, whether we know it or not. 9/10<br />There you go. Now go out and kill everything I said.
B0000027FQ|5.0|It's bad idea to record heavy metal in studio. Take few thousands fans and play it to them.<BR>All the songs in this album were recorded number of times in studio, but nothing compares to this live appearance.

I guarantee you will laugh, cry, cringe and shudder, and leave the theatre completely satisfied. If you want more information on Nash read the book.<BR>     There are some real suprises. Ron Howard made this a feel good movie about a genius...he's added a little sugar, and in so doing directed a marvelous film. Kudos to all!
B00005NGAG|1.0|Is worth rootting for in this picture. The women are suppose to be pretty nieve murders. The men all corrupt. So because the men are bad guys that makes it okay for these women to get away with murder. To many movie are given 5 stars that are not deserving. This is one of them. 5 star rating are for great movie's. Movie's that you want to watch time and again. This movie I put on fast forward. I fell we should be a little more discerning. Because if movie's like this is given 5 star's and we do not speak up; we then deserve what we get. I like a good film noir. But to many times I have read a excellent review and come away wondering what the person saw in the picture. So don't take the bait just because you like a good mystery. This movie is predictable and has very little suspence.
6304698658|5.0|Christmas Vacation is by far the best christmas film ever made!Its funny,it has great characters , and still manages to keep that christmas vibe alive throughout the film.As the title suggests , it wouldnt be xmas without this movie.

(Dvd available)
0066620996|5.0|I agree. I rate this book somewhere from good to great. That's why I give it 5 stars (there's no 41/2). Like all the other good to great &quot;how to&quot; books, it does lack the simple but comprehensive explanation of the philosophical underpinnings of leadership that is necessary for the reader/student to really understand. For that, I recommend a book titled &quot;West Point&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. You can get it right here on Amazon.com, also.
6300181553|5.0|I highly recommend this film.  It is very entertaining.<BR>I'd give it ten stars if I could.  It's a real classic!
0743201140|5.0|Author Norman Thomas Remick rated &quot;Now&quot; 5-star for its presentation and value as a &quot;how to&quot; book, but added that the reader would truly understand by getting a grasp on the philosophy of leadership as he had to do when writing his own book on leadership called &quot;West Point&quot;. After reading &quot;Now&quot;, I did take the trouble to venture a little further into the subject of leadership by finding &quot;West Point&quot; on Amazon.com and buying it. Now I see what Mr. Remick means. I do, in fact, now feel like somewhat of an expert after reading his book in addition to &quot;Now&quot;. I recommend it. For the price, you can't beat what is virtually an education. I, otherwise, probably would not have appreciated &quot;Now&quot; enough to give it 5 stars.
0790744759|5.0|I highly recommend this film.  Judy Garland is wonderful in it!<BR>I think it's one of her best film.  I'd give this film 10 stars if I could.  I can watch it again and again and never tire of it.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie has definitely proven that Disney is no longer the king on top of the animation film genre. The digital animation studio PDI and Dreamworks have certainly earned that spot with &quot;Shrek&quot;. In terms of quality, story, believable characters, humor, and the mind-blowing, eye-popping CG-animation, &quot;Shrek&quot; has surpassed Disney &amp; Pixar a million times over. Just take a look at their latest release &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; Although &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; is not a bad film, my own kids still chose to watch &quot;Shrek&quot; over again after watching &quot;Monsters Inc&quot;. And as an adult, if I had to make a choice  between watching &quot;Monsters Inc&quot; or &quot;Shrek&quot; in the theater again, I'd honestly pick &quot;Shrek&quot;. Maybe its the &quot;magic&quot; about it, but I just can't seem to get tired of watching it over again everytime my kids pop the dvd in the player. I just keep getting amazed by the animation and keep laughing at all the jokes over again. Believe me, the movie is THAT GOOD. As a final word, I can definitely say &quot;Shrek&quot; is next year's Oscar winner for best animated film. You just mark my words.
B00004R99M|5.0|I have watched this film many times, and highly recommend it <BR>to anyone.  They don't make them like this anymore.  I'd give it 20 stars if I could!
B000003TSP|4.0|The one thing that appeals to me in music is intriguing a listener with unexpected chords, melody, etc.  This album is filled with that.  The first time I listened to it I was amazed at what was occuring harmonically.  It was gorgeous.  The beats are so straight out and delicious.  This is an incredible cd.  So why did I label it a 4?  I guess because I want other Portishead fans to know that this is completely different from original Portishead.  The beats are pure trip hop and her voice is a little more exposed, while the harmonic progressions are completely unexpected.  Although, I think it was an absolutely positive progression, others might not.  If you are a portishead fan, I think it is necessary to have this in your collection.  Buy this cd-it is absolutely delicious.
B00005K2UF|5.0|On Saturday, November 3, The New York Voices accompanied andunaccompanied by the Waterbury Symphony Orchestra, came to the restored Warner Theater in Torrington, Connecticut.  I had never heard vocalists Darmon Meader, Peter Eldridge, Kim Nazarian, and a very pregnant Lauren Kinhan, before, but I sat enthralled as they performed 8 of the 14 titles on their Sing, Sing, Sing CD.   They also gave the filled theater audience an example of Antonio Carlos Jobim's Desafinado, and after a standing ovation, they cameback for a final song with the Waterbury Symphony Orchestra.  The quartet(plus) most impressed me when they rendered 2 of their songs acappella.
B000002UB6|5.0|Get over it, people! So the Beatles were not exactly firing on all cylinders when they recorded this material. So their regular producer was not present for some of the recording, and they handed it to an outsider to &quot;fix&quot; after letting it sit for a year. So some of them may have even encouraged that oustider to ruin one of the songs deliberately to spite a band member who had just announced he was quitting... SO WHAT!! In spite of these facts, anyone who gives this a rating less than 5 stars is doing so ONLY in comparison to the utter perfection of their other albums. I mean, seriously - if somebody put out an album this good today, we would all drop our drawers and hail it as the future of rock'n'roll. I defy you to listen to &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; and not feel good all over. That's all there is to say.
B00003CXXI|4.0|This is really a must see movie! Its both cute and exciting, and will be enjoyed not just by kids, but people of all ages. <br />At times it is hilariously funny, the characters are individual, interesting, quirky and memorable...the whole muffin man scene still makes me laugh after watching it over and over again.<br />This is a movie not to be missed.
B00005ARDC|5.0|I saw them live last Thursday (they played in LA). They are excellent. THe bassist rocks and it gave me the impression that they are a very compact and tight band. I'm not gonna comment on the comparison with JAMC, 'cos I'm not into them, though due to the distortions, feedback and stuff they displayed on their gig i would say that they are closer in sound to My Bloody valentine. Check out first three songs and Spread your love. The last song Salvation sounds much better live, with a 15-minute-long extended psychedelic jam a la Dandy Warhol (though my ears are still ringing). This is the best CD I've listened so far this year. Don't miss them.
0792846710|2.0|This movie starts off way too slow, and I lost interest before I could get to any of the cool parts. Unfortunately, I'm the kinda guy that just can't fast forward, so I never bothered to watch the rest.
B00005RDVW|5.0|From the first time I saw this feature back in the '50s, I have loved it most of all...there is so much here that is reminiscent of the Golden Times of childhood, what a special time it is and how fleeting...the idea that one can choose not to grow up at all, but live as a perennial child in a place of beauty, some danger, although not real danger, just enough to keep things interesting, and adventures and wonderful spots throughout the island to visit, is a universally appealing one. The music is perfectly suited to this vision of Halcyon days gone by, from the favorite &quot;I Can Fly&quot; to &quot;The Pirate Song&quot; to &quot;What Makes the Red Man Red&quot; to the Lullaby that Wendy sings to the Lost Boys, it's just wonderfully evocative and captures the mood of each moment perfectly.<br />The opening shot that slowly zooms in to the Darling house is fabulous, as is the extraordinary detail of the house itself; I notice something different every time I see it. The animators built an exact miniature of the house down to the smallest detail and fixtures, etc, to aid them in their drawing, and this attention to detail and quality are very apparent throughout.<br />The voices, from Bobby Driscoll as Peter to Kathryn Beaumont as Wendy are wonderfully voiced, very believable without being cloying or self conscious, real kids having real adventures.<br />The colors are so various and rich it stuns the eye, as does the shot of the Island of Never Never Land, the first time we see it, from high above, the Pirate Ship anchored in the harbor, Mermaid Lagoon, the Indian Camp, etc, it is SO beautiful and amazing that they (the animators) were so astute in their picture of a child's fantasy, their own island of adventures. The interaction between Captain Hook and the Crocodile is very funny, as is the byplay with Hook and Smee, the bumbling, endearing servant to the Captain. Tinker Bell is great as the jealous, somewhat snippy fairy who accompanies Pan wherever he goes and displays loyalty of the first order, being willing to sacrifice her life for his.<br />I also love the animal outfits worn with great joy by the Lost Boys, who are a fascinating group in their own right. Despite all the fun and adventure, the Darling children opt to return to their own home and Pan obliges them in yet another visually stunning scene when Tinkerbell transforms the Pirate Ship into a thing of beauty by showering it completely with golden fairy dust.<br />When they have been safely deposited back into their room, the Darlings return from their party just in time to see Peter sailing across the night sky in the wonderful Pirate Ship, which travels across the Moon on a sea of clouds...Wendy, Mr. and Mrs. Darling watch from the Nursery window, and we leave them there, a family, happy and united in their wonderment, the adults and the child, together in their memories of a wonderful chapter of Youth Eternal, as all remember their own experiences with Peter Pan, the boy of Youth and Joy forever.ays loyalty of the first order, being willing to sacrifice her life for his.<BR>I also love the animal outfits worn with great joy by the Lost Boys, who are a fascinating group in their own right.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This has got to be the *worst* movie I have ever seen in my life. Terrible, insipid dialogue; ridiculous and unbelievable situations and scenes; and modified history. The war scenes are quite well done, but those just don't make up for the complete lack of a believable plot and the lack of chemistry amongst the lead actors. There were so many REAL stories that could have been told about the people who gave their lives at Pearl Harbor -- why was the decision made to fabricate a foolish love story that is completely unbelievable and predictable, and foist that on an unsuspecting public?
B00005NWRS|5.0|I bought this the first day it came out, listened to it once, and was a tad disappointed because it wasn't as good as Heartbreaker.  Now, over a month later that is the ONLY bad thing I can say about this record.  I still like Heartbreaker better, but this is a very solid effort.  My favorite tracks are The Rescue Blues and Nobody Girl, although the whole album is good.  What makes this album special though (the first Sea and Cake CD is like this as well) is the fact that you can put this in at anytime and enjoy it.  New York's CBGB stands for Country, Blue Grass, Blues, and ended up being a haven for punk rock.  Ryan Adams is a punk who plays what CBGB was supposed to stand for.
B0000025VU|4.0|This was a minor return to form for Dylan when it was released in 1983, being his first secular record since Street Legal in 1978. It also featured his first significant protest songs in quite a while. Overall, it's a really good album, featuring all of those characteristics, as well as his best set of lyrics since Blood On The Tracks. The music still sounds fine today, though it is seriously steeped in early 80's electronics, and features a bit too much of that always annoying electronic percussion at times. However, this album features several very good songs or near masterpieces. Jokerman is the logical extension of the music he was putting out his his three albums before this one, and it is hailed as one of his greatest tracks ever. Sweetheart Like You is a great love song (along with its counterpart, the equally awesome closer, Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight.) License To Kill and, especially I and I and Man of Peace are good songs as well. Dylan was very prolific during this period, as can be attested by the excellent lyrics here, some of his best in a long time. (Of course, we also know the unfortunate by-product of this prolificness, there were many great songs written for this album that didn't make it on, for whatever reason. Some has been subsequently released; some are still in the vaults. One can only wonder how great an album this would've been, had these songs been included.) Still, it's a good album all the same. The only blemishes on its surface are the songs Neighborhood Bully and Union Sundown. These aren't bad songs by any means, but they do come off a little too contrived and forced, particularly the latter. (Should've knocked 'em off in favor of Blind Willie McTell and Foot of Pride, say?) Still, this was Dylan's best album in a long time, and an overlooked gem in his catalog.
0671042858|4.0|I believe that Steven King went out in a entirely differnt limb on the book 'The Girl Who loved Tom Gordon'. It is beyond his normal supernatural thrillers. Even though it deals with an issue that has been replayed many times...the story of someone lost in the woods and their quest to find rescue, it is still filled with action and suspense which makes you want to continue. The only piece involved in the book which botherd me throughout the novel was his characterization of Trisha (the main character). She is supposed to be a 9 year old girl. Although the knolege she has in the situations she is presented with do not account for a nine year old. That is in no way a reason not to read the book. It just is a part that I found oddly made and if she had been older than possibly the book would have been more realistic. He also seems to try to make it like a non-fiction book mixed with one supernatural &quot;thing&quot; that occures throught the book, which doesnt really go together but it at least throws in some extra intrest to the reader. I would recommend this book since it isnt that long especailly for a King novel and it is well written even if its a story that has a predictable ending.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. - THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL is one of my all-time favorite classics. And it's one of Steven Speilberg's greatest films of all-time. I am 18 years old now, and when I was young, I used to not like E.T. all that much and didn't really care for it, even though my family owns the video. But a few years ago I started watching it again and it definitely grew on me and I began to love it! <br />E.T., as we all know, is the story about a 10-year-old lonely boy named Elliot in need of a good friend, and it's also about an alien from another world who gets left-behind when his space ship lands on Earth. The two discover each other and start a unique friendship. Elliot (Henry Thomas) tries to tell his family and his older brother's friends about E.T., but nobody believes him. So he ends up hiding E.T. from everyone so the law and the government and the FBI doesn't find out about him and take him away to do research on him. Then Elliot's older brother Michael, and his younger sister (a very young Drew Barrymore) find out about E.T. when Elliot introduces them to E.T. and they also learn to love him. E.T. has special powers but all he really wants is to find his way home so Elliot tries to help him find out how to get home and find out where home really is to E.T.<br />This undeniable masterpiece has some of the best special effects ever and a terrific solid storyline and plot. Well-done, superb acting by the entire cast, especially from Henry Thomas, who is indeed, at his best in this film. Some of the lines are unforgettable, and the most memorable in movie history like, &quot;E.T. phone home&quot;. I can watch the film again and again without ever being bored or getting sick of it. The music and score are absolutely stunning and beautiful, too. The DVD isn't so bad, although they could have added more special features to it, especially since this is a classic film. I also can't wait for it's re-release in theaters March 2002. The re-release will be digitally remastered and will even have some never-before-seen footage that was probably in the original script and they had filmed the scenes while filming the movie, but got cut out of the film. I've seen the original trailer for the re-release when they premiered it on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; so I know it will be just as excellent and spectacular as the original version, perhaps even more because it will be better picture quality with extra scenes! I am most definitely going to be seeing the re-release when it hits theaters in March of 2002, and you should, too. But until then, buy the DVD or video - E.T. is one of the greatest films of all-time. It's a revelation of the new film erra! :-)
0800141385|5.0|To those Celine Dion fans who don't understand why she will never quite equal Streisand in the eyes of many of Barbra's fans, I present exhibit A: Funny Girl. I was 15 years old when I first saw this film and fell in love with Barbra. She simply wowed me. Bounced off the screen with her presence. And that voice! Just an extraordinary talent. Yes, she's become a bit out of control and beyond full of herself as the years have gone by. I can't sit through Mirror Has To Faces and some of her later films. But show me Funny Girl (or The Way We Were) and I'm that 15 year old again who fell in love with &quot;The Greatest Star.&quot;  If you have never seen this movie before, don't let biases that you might have formed against Streisand in recent years stop you. It is really, truly a must-see. She more than deserved that Oscar! (Something I guess Celine still has on her To-Do List.)
0671867369|5.0|Another excellent work by Ambrose! He really hits home with his descriptions of the battles and training that these men went through. As in most of Ambrose's war books, one of the ever present themes is the 'American Spirit' and the role it plays in the war. He stresses how instrumental the brotherhood of these men was in their success. This brotherhood was forged very early on in the story.  All the men had to go through the same rite of passage, boot camp at Camp Toccoa. There they learned how to be soldiers, and it was there, at Toccoa, that the men forged their bonds with each other by sweating and bleeding together throughout boot camp.  That is where Ambrose's American Spirit is created within these men. And it carries throughout the story. Yet another good example of the prevalent 'American Spirit' is the scene where Winters leads an undersized group against a much larger, and better armed German brigade, and still ends up with the victory by following their training, 'fighting as one'.  All in all truly an uplifting and heartwarming theme....
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is ruler of Durok.  After he realizes he must be a king in order to be ruler of a kingdom he chooses Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) as his bride.  Fiona is locked away inside a castle surrounded by a fire breathing dragon.  Farquaad holds a tournament to determine the princesses rescuer.  Shrek (Mike Myers) wins the tournament and makes a deal with Farquaad.  The princess for the deed to his swamp.  Farquaad agrees and together Shrek and his loundmouth donkey (Eddie Murphy) set off on an unforgettable adventure.<br />Shrek has already raked in over 266 million in the us box office alone and thats for a good reason so if you havent seen it yet, what are you waiting for.  This is a great film for all ages.  There is the perfect mix of humor for the younger and older audience.  The voice overs by the actors is excellent and the CGI is just jawdropping(look out Pixar).<br />Dreamworks has put together an excellent DVD.  The transfer is just flawless.  The picture is clean and there is no edge enhancement.  With all the debate over pan and scan and widescreen maybe this dvd should become the blue print for the standard.  Pan and Scan (don't know why some people prefer it) with DD on one disk and Anamorphic widescreen with DTS on the other for the video and audio freaks like myself.  The disk is just loaded with far to many extras to list here but trust me they will keep you busy for a couple of hours after the movie is over.  If you can only get one dvd this month Shrek should be it.
0694003611|5.0|This is the best book in the world. It's about a little rabbit that is going to bed, but he wants to say good night to everything in his room before he does. This is a wonderful childrens book.
B00000DATR|3.0|I fail to see why Oldfield is still using the TB moniker. After all, there is no improving on the original so he should make this the last one in the Tubular Bells series. An interesting cd with a very good track- 7/Man in the rain, a few interesting moments but I actually like Tubular Bells 2 better. Certainly not the killer cd I had hoped it would be. (...) Sound quality is very good.
6303257844|5.0|Speed.  Just the name gets you wondering.  Well, this movie speeds right along.  Never a dull moment, never stopping for breath.  Right from the beginning, when they show the elevator shaft, it is full of suspense.  <br />Keanu Reeves delivers one of his best performances.  Sandra Bullock becomes a known name - this is her breakthrough hit.  Dennis Hopper is the perfect villian.  Great movie.  Pick it up if you are bored and need a little rush in your life.

B00005KARK|4.0|Dumbo, the classic story with a Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer twist, about a little elephant with big ears that doesn't fit in until he discovers he can fly. This is the second Disney DVD title (the first is Pocahontas) that includes a grainy video transfer to DVD. I can't understand, with the magic of digital transfer why Disney would release any DVD with a grainy look. Especially given the time it takes Disney to release each one of their classic stories to DVD. I will say one thing though, the extras that Disney has been including in their DVDs makes it well worth the price despite the flaws.
0800141660|5.0|This is the story of three sisters (two of marriageable age) and their mother who find themselves suffering a reversal of fortune.  At the death of their father, their half-brother and his wife turn them out (in the most polite way, of course!) to make their own way on a paltry saving.  The sisters proceed to fall in love and the story is of the trials and tribulations of those relationships, set in late 18th century England.<br />Sense and Sensibility is normally regarded as one of Austin's weaker efforts, but it's still highly entertaining.  This film is entirely faithful to the original story, yet rearranged and adapted in a fresh and fun way.  Emma Thompson does double-duty as the screenwriter and as the main character, Elinor (the sister with &quot;sense&quot;).  The cast is impeccably chosen, from Kate Winslet as the &quot;sensibility&quot; sister Marianne (no one does spoiled impetuousity better) and Hugh Grant as Elinor's suitor (no one does shy romantic better) to the lesser known actors.  Those who only know Alan Rickman as hammy bad-guys in Die Hard and Robin Hood will be pleasantly surprised by his range of talents.  <br />Ang Lee lends a sure hand in direction, similar to his work in Eat Drink Man Woman.  The movie looks good.  Thompson's screenplay is entirely faithful to the book in spirit, while introducing a great many changes.  Elinor, as played by Thompson, is obviously not 19 years old, Hugh Grant is not &quot;plain,&quot; and several characters are dropped completely, such as Lucy Steele's sister.  In addition, the dialogue is heavily rearranged and edited, scenes are added that don't appear in the book, etc.  In spite of this, the film is probably the truest adaptation I have ever seen in a 2-hour studio film.  The new scenes and additional dialogue are generally adapted from Austin's editorial comments, and so are &quot;true&quot; to the original story, even if they aren't explicitly in the novel as filmed.<br />The DVD has a few extras, including an audio commentary and deleted scenes.  Oddly, there are only two deleted scenes included, although many more are mentioned in the commentary as being filmed and then being cut.  I, for one, would like to see the duel between Col. Brandon and Willoughby, but alas, it is not included.  Thus, the DVD is pretty humdrum, except for the fact that it looks very good.  I think Lee's films should always be seen in widescreen, as the setting is important to many of his shots.<br />Therefore, this disc gets 5/5 on the strength of the film itself, with little value added from the DVD extras.
B000002UKS|5.0|Foo Fighters are great, they mix rock with pop so well.  Every song is fantastic with 'Everlong' being one of my favorite songs ever.  They have quiet, calming songs like 'Doll' and 'Walking AFter You' and rocking but melodic tunes like 'Monkey Wrench' and 'Hey Johhny Park!'  I never get bored of this album because it is incredibly varied.  Everytime I go out at weekends, this album gets played beforehand becuase it's a feelgood record that sets you up for the evening!  This is a classic album in my eyes. <BR>If you like the Foos, try Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam.<br />Buy it, quick!

078322608X|5.0|IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE, DON'T READ ANY OF THIS.  THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE AND MY ARGUMENTS BELOW WILL RUIN IT FOR YOU.<br />With that said, I loved this movie, it is brilliant.  But that isn't the purpose of my review.  I intend to disprove sigma126's comments.<br />sigma126 remarks that if time could be changed allowing for little things like the killing of the two bums and generally interacting with people of that time, why couldn't be bigger events be changed.<br />My response is: who says time was changed?  Maybe the only way it ever happened was the bums getting killed.  The entire plot of the movie suggests that the future can effect the past just as much as the past the future.  He saw his older self killed when he was a kid in the air port.  His getting killed there didn't change anything.  His traveling back in time didn't change anything.  These actions created the result that was in existence already.<br />It's the concept of that when you travel back in time to change something the things you do could possibly be what created that circumstance in the first place.<br />I'm going to stop now because my brain hurts...
B00004YYDI|5.0|i guess im a sucker, for any movie with natalie portman.....but this movie was the first ive seen her in and the best. Reno  makes this movie just as good as Portman, but i must say Portman gets all the praise.... its almost like i fell in love with her character.... she makes her character seem so real.. theres hope of meeting a girl such as that in NY city. ( haha, just a dream ) .ands she beautiful too....cant reely say theres many actresses that have made their character  appear so real..... i fell in love with her, but as young as she is in the movie, the maturity in her is ...just....wow anyway,Reno has a certain originality in his character..... drinks only milk, watches old movies. and has his best friend portrayed by a plant... with him and portman together, it gives the film 5 stars just awesome... great acting, my favorite jean reno, and natalie portman flik.
B00004VW0V|3.0|...why don't I love this? It's because not all artists are capable of epics no matter how brilliant they are. The title cut is uneven, disjointed, a montage that sounds like it's made up of &quot;songlets&quot; he couldn't expand enough for each to stand on its own. And it isn't like Stevens can't totally blow you away with a simple 3 or 4 minute number. As witness the Caribbean flavored &quot;Tuesday's Dead&quot; and &quot;Longer Boats&quot;. A bow to his own Greek roots in &quot;Rubylove&quot;. The simple Anglican hymn &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot;. The basic fingerpicked elegance of &quot;Moonshadow&quot;. I guess when this album came out in 1973, it was &quot;in&quot; to do long material. The Progressive movement at the time were great at it, and the younger generation of Prog has bred true. Blues and Jazz music is frequently epic in proportions as well. The problem with Stevens was that, while he had been influenced at times by these sounds, he was not part of any of them. He was always best at what he'd been doing up to the time of this album, and it was to his credit that he went right back to what he was best at afterwards. If you want to build a partial Cat Stevens collection, this is one of the ones to skip.
B000002UAX|5.0|The white ablum is defintly not only one of the best beatle albums, but one the best albums ever recorded. The main strength of the album is the unbelievable quality of the writing. The beatles are definitly the only artists in history who have put together a double LP and not have a single piece of filler. Happiness is a Warm Gun, Revolution 1, Blackbird, Cry Baby Cry, etc are all some of the best songs I have ever heard. <br />The white album easily beats Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road and Let It Be. The only thing wrong with the album would be the track-order on disc 1 (ie following While my guitar... with Happiness is a Warm Gun seems like a definite no no). Other than that though, its perfect and disc 2 moves flawlessly.<br />It took some time for me to decide to buy the white album (just because of the high cost) but I am now very glad I did.

Through clear explanations of access points and hindrances, the reader can discover how to attain the so often considered elusive state of enlightenment. Where everyday life becomes an enriching and savoring experience.  Another inspiring guide to living a meaningful life is called &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work,&quot; by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane.  I highly recommend both of these books.
B000002UAO|5.0|With rubber soul, the beatles effectively killed Pop as the dominant form of music and also invented the album format. The reason for this is that this is the record which the beatles made for themselves and not for their teen fans. As it says in the Anthology &quot; We stopped asking 'will the girls like this song'&quot;.<br />The subject matter of the songs are much deeper, darker and profound than anything before it. No one would have dreamt about writing something such as Girl or Norwegian Wood previously (and still be able to sell huge amounts of records) but rubber soul opened the for artists to say what they wanted and still be part of the mainstream.<br />So ignore Sgt. Pepper and go out and buy rubber soul (and not burning it because then you dont get to look at their best album cover) and listen to it over and over because THIS is the album which changed rock and roll.

B000006XDR|5.0|Camel's self-entitled 1973 debut sounds like a band not sounding very confident, but their followup, Mirage found the band in a much improved form. Back in 1972, there was a live recording that was later released in 1992 called On the Road 1972. On that disc shows Camel in a rather raw and aggressive form. They even played &quot;Lady Fantasy&quot; and &quot;White Rider&quot; which later ended up on Mirage (the reason I can tell those early versions were from '72 was Peter Bardens still had his VCS-3 synth, while on Mirage the VCS-3 was gone in favor of the Minimoog). Mirage, of all the studio Camel albums I have ever heard is the one that best captures the raw excitement and energy of the On the Road 1972 disc. When you hear &quot;Freefall&quot; and &quot;Lady Fantasy&quot;, you're basically treated with some of Camel's most hard rocking material. &quot;Supertwister&quot; is the first Camel song to feature Andy Latimer flutework, and the song was actually in honor of the Dutch progressive rock band Supersister who themselves had released a handful of albums in the early 1970s on Polydor. Mirage has two different covers. There's one that pokes fun of the Camel cigarette pack, and another with Camel as a dragon, done in a '70s sci-fi fashion. I happen to like the latter better, but for humorous purposes, the cigarette pack cover is pretty silly. Mirage does receive lots of hype in the prog community, and the album is often regarded as a Camel fan favorite, and it's really not hard to see why. If you're a prog rock junkie and this is not in your collection, then you need to get yourself a copy.

6304493681|1.0|Ghost in a Shell has everything going for it; unique plot, engrossing story, excellent animation, and a decent soundtrack.  However it's greatest shortfall is the characters.  These people seem to have no emotion whatsoever.  Making it impossible to form even the slightest attachment to them, which is essential in any successful movie.  The bottom line is that when the big finale happens, you could care less what happens to the characters as they are about as lifeless as the bricks on my patio outside.  If your looking for something with plot, story, and characters that can get you involved in a movie I'd recommend putting this back on the shelf and getting Princess Mononoke, or Record of Lodoss war(OAV).

B00000JNJ1|4.0|What great talent! Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood, Ronnie Lane, Ian McLaglin, and Kenny Jones, all talented performers, who created for a short while, the world's greatest bar band. Rocking hard and playing loosely this band just seemed to throw things together and hope for the best. Not just a back up band for Stewart, Faces created music for a Saturday night, out on the town, hitting the clubs, and having a real good time doing it. Listening to songs like \\"Cindy Incidentally,\\" \\"Pool Hall Richard\\" and \\"Borstal Boys,\\" you can hear the skill of the band, but Faces always seemed to be more about having fun. This collection is more complete than Snakes and Ladders and you will be hard pressed to find a band that better epitomizes the swagger of good old-fashioned rock and roll. There are many bands that have created more memorable music, but few that sound like they are having more fun.

B00005QIPH|4.0|I first heard these guys when they performed on Late Night w/Conan O'Brien, and was impressed enough to take a chance buying their album. As the rating would indicate, I did not regret it. These guys have a great sound. Most of these reviews talk about the NYC sound, pointing to The Velvet Underground, Television, and The Stooges as similar bands. I only know the VU (probably a generational thing; I'm college-age), but what these guys reminded me of most is a mixture of Velvet Underground and some early grunge, maybe 70% VU, 15% Foo Fighters (&quot;Hard to Explain&quot; sounds to me like a Foo Fighters song with Lou Reed doing vocals), 10% Stone Temple Pilots, and 5% original. All rock is derivative, it's what you do with your influences that makes you a great band. The key to this album is multiple listens; the first time I listened, I was not all that impressed, but with each new listen I grew to enjoy it more and more, until it became one of my favorite albums. Every time you listen a new element jumps out, and the sound just takes some getting used to maybe (I never understood the psychology of musical enjoyment, so I have no idea why some albums sound great right away, while others require time to love). These guys put together an awesome sound which I hope will get the commercial success that it warrants (apparently the critics already love it, but will the radios and mtv?). It's too bad they had to cut &quot;New York City Cops&quot; from the U.S. release, though they really had to do it after the Sept. 11 tragedy. Check this album out, you will not regret it! Favorite songs are &quot;Hard to Explain,&quot; &quot;The Modern Age,&quot; &quot;Alone, Together,&quot; and &quot;Barely Legal&quot;.
1558216340|5.0|In his terrific book Hitler's Willing Executioners, Daniel Jonah Goldhagen provided us with a vital insight for analyzing the horrors of the Twentieth Century.  The specific point that he made in the book was that Hitler would not have been able to perpetrate the Holocaust without significant levels of outright assistance and implicit support from vast segments of the German population.  A more general point can, and should, be extrapolated from this : that the great tyrannies of the past hundred years have been in some disturbing sense dependent on the will of the people in those oppressive societies.  As a democrat (small 'd') and a conservative, I am particularly drawn to this view by both my faith in the power of the people and by my skepticism about the capabilities of government.  I simply find it impossible to believe that any government could long maintain itself in the face of general and spirited opposition from its citizenry.<br />The most troubling aspect of this is that it requires us to face the fact that regimes which we find horrific--the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Pol Pot's Cambodia, Red China, etc.--were, and are, essentially expressive of popular will, perhaps not of the majority, but of at least a plurality.  Here too conservative philosophy is a help, because it is based on a fairly pessimistic view of human nature.  Where the idealism of the Left assumes that Man is fundamentally good and that Man in the State of Nature is peaceful and selfless, we of the Right assume that Man is fundamentally selfish and violent.  We would not find it surprising that one segment of society would try to oppress, or even exterminate, another.<br />Now I'm not a complete pessimist : I do like to think that we (Americans) are different, and that we are sufficiently individualistic that would never tolerate totalitarianism here.  Indeed, I maintain that much of American Literature is based on the premise of individuals resisting the soul deadening forces of oppressive society and that most of our greatest literary characters have been just such rugged individualists--from Huck Finn to Cool Hand Luke to RP McMurphy.  These works, and the products of more popular culture like Red Dawn, express our belief that we (Americans) are different and reflect a hope that we would behave differently when faced with oppression.  These are not beliefs that can, nor hopefully ever will be, put to the test.  But it is notable that so much of our population is made up of those who fled oppression, and of their descendants.  Perhaps, just perhaps, we--from Baptists to Quakers to Jews, from Huguenots to Irish to Vietnamese boat people--really are the kind of people who won't tolerate such oppression.  Perhaps we have been fortunate enough to skim off the stubborn freedom loving cream of many nations.<br />At any rate, central to this understanding--that people were more or less willing participants in their own oppression--is its opposite, that those who refused to participate had alternatives.  And it is this that makes Oskar Schindler, Nelson Mandela, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Cuban Freedom Flotillas, and the like so compelling to us; all serve to reinforce our belief that it is possible to refuse to be complicit in even these most coercive of systems.  It is from this context that Slavomir Rawicz's great memoir, The Long Walk,  derives its power.<br />Rawicz was a Polish cavalry officer in WWII, serving during the futile resistance to the Nazi blitzkrieg.  As a Russian speaking resident of Pinsk, in eastern Poland, the Soviets, who had taken over this portion of the partitioned land, simply assumed Rawicz was a spy and shipped him to a prison camp in Siberia--Camp Number 303 on the Lena River.  On Easter Sunday 1941, Rawicz and six other prisoners escaped and started walking South.  They eventually traveled the length of Lake Baikal, through Mongolia, across the Gobi Desert, through Tibet, and over the Himalayas, before arriving in British-controlled India.  Despite the hardships they faced, most of which you can imagine just from their itinerary, they were continually driven forward by a simple dream of freedom.  Only four of their original number made it--a girl who joined their party along the way also died--and Rawicz (with his collaborator Ronald Downing) tells their story in a simple unaffected style, but their arduous journey speaks volumes about what individuals can achieve when they cling to that dream.  The book, like their walk, is a triumph.  Let the final word be Rawicz's own, from his 1993 Introduction to the book :<br />  I hope The Long Walk will remain as a memorial to all those who live and die for freedom, and for<br />  all those who for many reasons could not speak for themselves.  I had to tell my story as a warning<br />  to the living, and as a moral judgment for the greater good.<br />GRADE : A+-controlled India.

0374172897|1.0|This much praised, award-winning novel is essentially an extended riff on Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, which is unreadable, while The Hours is merely unenjoyable.  After an opening scene where Woolf commits suicide by walking into a river with a rock in her pocket, Cunningham intertwines three storylines : a day in the life of Virginia Woolf as she is at work on Mrs. Dalloway; a day in the life of Laura Brown, a pregnant suburban Los Angeles mother with a three year old son, a war hero husband, and a desperate longing to escape her suffocating life; and a day in the life of Clarissa Vaughn, a middle aged lesbian book editor in Greenwich Village who is planning a party for her friend and former lover Richard, who is dying of AIDs but has just won a prestigious poetry prize.  Both Clarissa and his Mother are central characters in Richard's poetry and his novel.<br />Beyond the fact that they are all gay and suicidal, these are simply not characters who think and behave like the rest of us.  At one point Clarissa, who was nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway years before by Richard, meets her friend Walter, a despised author of gay romance novels, who dresses too youthfully for people's taste, and adorns himself with beautiful young men :<br />  'Nice to see you,' Walter says.  Clarissa knows--she can practically see--that Walter is, at this<br />  moment, working mentally through a series of intricate calibrations regarding her personal<br />  significance.  Yes, she's the woman in the book, the subject of a much-anticipated novel by an<br />  almost legendary writer, but the book failed, didn't it?  It was curtly reviewed; it slipped silently<br />  beneath the waves.  She is, walter decides, like a deposed aristocrat, interesting without being<br />  particularly important.  She sees him arrive at his decision.  She smiles.<br />Now we do all know the Walters of the world, the coworker whose attention wanders if a boss walks by and you can see him thinking, \\"Hey, there's someone more important I could be talking to.\\"  But do you befriend these people and invite them to parties?  Of course not, they are too transparently phony.  The problem in this book however is that everyone is phony; they are all playing roles; after all, homosexuality itself is ultimately little more than a pose.  Virginia Woolf has only a tenuous grip on sanity; Laura Brown shares a brief moment of passion with another woman and longs to escape her marriage; Richard plays at being the great poet, though he and Clarissa are conscious of the fact that much of his reputation rests on his homosexuality and his disease; Clarissa, despite decades of a loving relationship with another woman, loves Richard, who, despite his decades of homosexuality, loves her.  This is a world of artificiality.  People do and say things for effect, like reading and praising Virginia Woolf, and not because the actually believe in what they say or do.  Clarissa has never had a Quarter Pounder--it simply isn't done--who do you know whose identity is held hostage to the idea that you can't eat at McDonalds?  More importantly, who do know, and like, that looks down on eating at McDonalds.<br />If you plan on reading the book, please read no farther, the following will betray some of the key \\"surprises\\" of the plot.  several reviewers referred to the surprising ways in which Cunningham ties the three plots together at the end of the book, but they can be surprising only to someone who is not paying attention.  Richard naturally turns out to be the Virginia Woolf doppelganger and upon his suicide, the funeral is attended by his mother, Laura Brown.  (An aside : one of the central activities that is used to show the emptiness of Laura's life back in the 40s is her rather sketchy attempt to bake a cake for her husband's birthday.  This, combined with her unhappy mewlings, was so reminiscent of the horrid song MacArthur Park--\\"someone left a cake out in the rain and I don't thing that I can take it,cause it took so long to bake it...\\"--that I found it hard to take her seriously.) The title, The Hours (which was also the original title of Mrs. Dalloway), and the essential outlook of the book are explained when Clarissa finds Richard perched on a windowsill in his apartment, about to leap to his death :<br />  He says, 'I don't know if I can face this.  You know.  The party and the ceremony, and then the<br />  hour after that, and the hour after that.'<br />  'You don't have to go the party.  You don't have to go to the ceremony.  You don't have to do<br />  anything at all.'<br />  'But there are still the hours, aren't there?  One and then another, and you get through that one<br />  and then, my god, there's another.'<br />Without sounding to harsh, let me just state my opinion that if you really think life is so awful that it just consists of a struggle to get through the hours of the day, you probably should commit suicide; it's hard to see how you are any great loss to the rest of us.<br />GRADE : Fan take it, cause it took so long to bake it...\\"--that I found it hard to take her seriously.)

0140131558|5.0|This book is advertised as detectives stories, but they are not in the strictest sense of the word.  These are stories about trying to find and maintain your identies, and not about finding murders or kidnappers.<br />The first story &quot;City of Glass&quot; is about a writer, Quinn, who has lost his family and seems to be lost without a purpose.  One day he recive a phone call for by mistake, the call is for a detective Paul Auster.  Out of interest Quinn decides to say he is Paul Auster and takes the case.  Quinn gets so involved in the case he loses everything else in his life.  His only lifeline during this time is a red notebook that he makes notes about the case in.  It is in this notebook that he tries to figure out who he is.<br />The second story, &quot;Ghosts,&quot; is meant to be like an old dective story, a la Dashell Hammett. It has a very surreal quality about it none of the charcters have real names, they are named after colors.  The story centers around Blue who is hired to watch Black.  All Black does is sit in his apartment and write.  Just like Quinn in the first story Blue loses his himself in the case and in Black.  The question is who hired Blue and why?<br />The third story, &quot;The Locked Room,&quot; is about a man who is never given a name, and his childhood friend Fanshawe.  Fanshawe has disappeared leaving his wife, child, and his unpublished work.  He leaves the task of deciding what to do with the unpublished work to his friend.  As his friend goes about getting the work published he becomes closer to Fanshawe's wife and son.  The friend and Fanshawe's wife finally marry.  The friend's troubles begin when he is asked to write a book about Fanshawe's life.  He becomes so absorbed in Fanshawe's life he almost loses himself in it.  Can Fanshawe's friend save himself and his life before it becomes lost in Fanshawe's.<br />Each character in each story struggles with who he is.  Auster plays with his role as a writer in these stories.  In the first story he puts himself in by name, and at the end of the last story he tries to explain why he wrote this collection of stories.<br />Overall this is collection is well worth the read.  It is full of imagery and well written.  I highly recomend this book for anyone who is looking for a book that will make them think, but is a quick read.he first story he puts himself in by name, and at the end of the last story he tries to explain why he wrote this collection of stories.<br />Overall this is collection is well worth the read.

A man-of-war is the very thing for a<br />  philosopher, above all in the Mediterranean: there are the birds, the fishes--I could promise you<br />  some monstrous strange fishes--the natural phenomena, the meteors, the chance of prize-money.<br />  For even Aristotle would have been moved by prize-money.... '<br />  'A ship must be a most instructive theatre for an inquiring mind....'<br />  'Prodigiously instructive, I do assure you, Doctor.'<br />  -Jack Aubrey convincing Stephen Maturin to ship out with him (Patrick O'Brian, Master and Commander)<br />Like most, I first learned of Patrick O'Brian's excellent series of naval adventures in the pages of the New York Times Book Review.  There, on January 6, 1991, Richard Snow wrote that the Aubrey and Maturin books were : &quot;...the best historical novels ever written.&quot;  This statement is not as jarring now as it was then.  We've grown accustomed to seeing rows of O'Brian's books on store shelves and millions have joined what was once an exclusive cult, but at the time Snow was writing the novels were still a well-kept secret, despite the fact that O'Brian had then been writing them for over twenty years.  At any rate, like any good little trend-sucking dilettante, I rushed out to find the first book in the series, Master and Commander, read it as quickly as possible, and was well and truly stumped.<br />I liked the characters, found the detailed portrayal of life aboard ship to be extremely interesting, and enjoyed much of the humor of the book.  But there was something really curious and elusive about the storytelling.  In the first place, the heroes are mere observers of the climactic sea battle, having been captured earlier, which seemed especially curious for an adventure story.  Even more disconcerting was the sense that I lacked much of the background information that the author expected the reader to bring to the novel.  It seemed as if O'Brian expected you to already be familiar with much of the early 19th century naval terminology, with the intricacies of the Napoleonic Wars, and with the culture, customs and language of the day.  It was like listening to a comedian and only understanding one out of every two or three jokes--you titter nervously and you can follow along thanks to context, but it's a tad humiliating.  I did like it enough to read the next though, Post Captain, and as I did, the joke finally dawned on me.<br />Patrick O'Brian writes these novels so that they could be read, understood, and enjoyed by the characters who populate them.  The reason that they so effectively transport us to another time and place is because they seem to have been written there and then.  His mission here is not to explain that epoch to us, but to present it for our consideration, nearly unadorned by modern sensibilities.  He writes as if he were actually a contemporary of his heroes and the books have the quality, not of historical novels at all, but instead of classic tales newly rediscovered.  Thanks to this unusual style, O'Brian is more often compared to Jane Austen than to C. S. Forester.<br />I don't mean to mislead anyone; the books aren't for all tastes and, even if you love them, O'Brian's  manner can be frustrating--you sometimes wish you had an interpreter.  But once you figure out what he's doing, if you accept the technique, you're in for a real treat.  The writing is outstanding.  The setting is endlessly interesting.  Aubrey, the bluff and hearty sea captain, and Maturin, the vulpine doctor and spy, make for a classic pairing of steadfast opposites, in the tradition of Holmes and Watson.  It is not easy reading but it is rewarding and once you read a couple, you'll be hooked.  And be warned, before he died earlier this year, O'Brian had completed twenty novels in the series, so you'll be hooked for a good long time.<br />GRADE : A+d as if O'Brian expected you to already be familiar with much of the early 19th century naval terminology, with the intricacies of the Napoleonic Wars, and with the culture, customs and language of the day.

The self-titled definitely pales in comparison to this.<br />This CD is definitely not for the faint of heart. Lead vocalist Serj Tankian sings, sure, but he also screams, yelps, howls, and does whatever else he feels like doing. The music also goes back and forth a lot between fast and slow sections. Buy it only expecting to be challenged by the back-and-forth nature of the songs. Below is my track-by-track rating:<br />1. Prison Song 10/10 A great way to start off the album 2) Needles 10/10 Definitely one of my favorites off this album...another hardcore piece. 3) Deer Dance 8/10 I don't like the mellow part of this song too much, but I think the heavy part is awesome. 4) Jet Pilot 8/10 This one clocks in at a very brief 2:07, and it is pure metal all the way. 5) X 8/10 This one clocks in at an even more concise 1:59, and it is about reducing reproduction. Another excellent song. 6) Chop Suey 10/10 The single, and probably the best song instrumentally on this album. 7) Bounce 7/10 This is my least favorite song on this album...it seems rushed. 8) Forest 10/10 This song is AMAZING! Back-and-forth vocals, heavy but spellbinding, this song is a great summary of System Of A Down's sound. 9) ATWA 9/10 This song is a little different, very mellow in most of the song, still very good though. 10. Science 9/10 I don't like some of the lyrics to this song; great instrumentally though. 11) Shimmy 10/10 Check this one out for yourself 12) Toxicity 7/10 Another one of the weaker songs...still not bad. 13) Psycho 10/10 Probably tied with Forest for best on this album. 14) Aerials 10/10 Another mellow song in the vein of ATWA. I really like the lyrics for this one. 15) Outro 9/10 Very mellow and not heavy at all...but still great!<br />Overall-135/150...easy 5 stars.
B00004T37H|5.0|I thiught this was the best movie that i have ever wached.  It have a good plot to it.  One of the down falls of this movie was that it was realy blooded.  But if you look past that it is a realy great movie.  I say that anyone thats janpanese cartoons will like this.
B00001NFCY|3.0|&quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; and &quot;Higher&quot;.  Those are two great songs.  The rest of the album though, nothing special.  I'm not a real big rock fan, so that's probably the main reason I don't like this cd that much.  I would reccomend buying this just because of the two songs I mentioned, but don't expect much else from any other song on here.  Also, even though I'm sure hard-core Creed fans will disagree with this, I think that Creed sounds a lot like bands like Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Sound Garden,etc.
B00005QHSS|5.0|Sure this is just edition of Mutter with an extra CD of four live tracks, but its an awesome collectors item.  The live tracks are great and the cover art is fantastic, simply fantastic.  Its a must have for collectors (like me, read that as obsessive), fans, and casual listeners.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Well, Michael. Once again you've managed to captivate us with yet another look into your mind and soul. Folks, I don't look at this piece of miraculous work as a greatest hits, because it isn't. It is a walk through the life of the band Enigma and the Mastermind behind them, Michael Cretu. He has brought us a touching and emotionally moving trip through the years of this simply Awesome band. He is a master of Aural, and Emotional stimulation!! If you've ever  enjoyed any of Enigma's work, this is a must buy!! To all that have doubted Michael's efforts of the past, it is redemption day!! Let it become one with you!!!
B00005QFF1|5.0|Yesturday I went and saw this movie at the international theater at my school.  When I realized it was about to be over I started seriously getting sad, I figured I wouldn't ever have the chance to see it again.  It is just one of thoses movies that is so innocent and sweet, it grabs your heart.  It had the whole audience laughing several times, but it was also so unbelievable how tough the girl is.  I love it and would recomend it to anyone.
0446310786|5.0|Another book for English class that I developed a strong attachment to.  It's definitely one of the best modern novels that have been written!  For those of you that haven't the slightest clue what this book is about...<br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a story of growing up, the childhood of Scout and Jem Finch in a small town in Alabama in the 1930's.  Their father, Atticus, is a respectable lawyer, given the job of defending Tom Robinson, a black man who is accused of raping a white woman.  It's a very dark theme that inhabits this innocent world of youthfulness, but that is part of the plot: to describe the loss of innocence and the maturing of the children in their views and actions in the face of various social issues such as prejudice and class distinction.  While being told from a child's point of view runs really deep and you'll be surprised by how intelligent Scout and Jem are.  The title, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is explained on pg. 90 of the book, declaring the sin of murdering the helpless and innocent.  The story is told in a flashback, by Scout, who recounts the events between her 5 and 9 years of age, the events leading up to her brother Jem's broken arm.<br />...Now don't think this book is totally dreary and hateful - most of the characters (like Scout, Jem, and Dill) are really pleasant and incredibly entertaining.  The story takes on the real life approach but it is most relevant and I truly agree that this book is a must-read for everyone.
B00003CX95|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  Mel Gibson does a excellent job of playing William Wallace. He shows great patriotism and courage in this movie.  I definitely like how he was willing to defend and die for his country.  Very detailed battle scenes which gives you a taste of how destructive war and battle can be, and how people lived in the 13th century.  3 hours of non stop action and dramatical scenes which capture all kinds of audiences.  One of the great things about this film is the ending.  Cant give away the story, but how the scottish continue to defend their country and stick together is what makes this film a must have for DVD fans.  Parents, it may be too graphic for young children though.

0783229526|2.0|When I heard about this film I thought I was in for a treat but I guess I was wrong.  Basically about some drug addicts who explore las vegas with every drug you can think of and spend lots of cash during the 70's.  Where is the storyline?  There was no plot and you probably need to be wired in order to understand the movie.  Never was a big fan of Depp anyway, but I do have to recommend Blow and Sleep Hollow.
B00000J2SR|4.0|Ah, Rainbow's final studio album. Hmmm, what can be said about it.<br />Well, it is a good album, and the last in a series of Rainbow albums desperately searching for commercial acceptance in the US. This is a far cry from &quot;Rainbow Rising&quot;, however, and seems to give an idea of where Mr Blackmore was eventually heading. The sword and sorcery lyrics of earlier days had by now given way to a more AOR direction (some may even say MOR), and once again the line-up had changed.<br />There is a degree of inconsistency about the album. Two instrumentals (lack of lyrical ideas or boredom, who knows!). But the band could still rock. <br />&quot;Stranded&quot; opens the set in much the same way that &quot;Death Alley Driver&quot; did on the previous album, and from the point everything seems to mellow out. Blackmore's playing is a lot more subdued than in the past, but shows a more sensitive side (FYI, I read an interview with RB during the accompanying tour, and he let it drop that he had to wear a back brace because of a pinched nerve in his neck).<br />This listener can only wonder whether any of the material which appeared on the following year's &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; Deep Purple reunion album could have ended up on this? How much different would it have been? Would it have rated 5 stars?
B00005N9CV|3.0|Diana Krall, riding a huge wave of popularity, probably has her pick of musicians, arrangements, and producers. If true, she has opted out of jazz and into a bland flavor of pop in her last two albums. She is doing her fans a great disfavor, because it is clear from two great renditions here that the earlier jazz-oriented Ms. Krall offers far more than her recent lightweight popular fare.<br />The first track is &quot;S'Wonderful,&quot; and it is. It's what this album could have been: luxurious strings and a &quot;Latin&quot; beat accompanying Ms. Krall's distinctive vocal interpretations and excellent piano riffs, with clean, intimate backing. The overall concept was not flawed, this and the song &quot;The Look of Love&quot; show that, but the orchestration and safe vocals on most of the album simply disappoint.<br />Track 2, &quot;Love Letters&quot; is average, the strings don't get in the way, Ms. Krall hits some interesting blue notes (otherwise largely absent on the album) and there's some appropriately dreamy piano. However, the tone is too languid and there's nothing very challenging--let alone interesting--about the arrangement. Track 3, &quot;I Remember You,&quot; will remind you of track 2; just as Track 4 will remind you of Track 3: The songs begin to run together. The high-pitched, dreamy vocals and lackluster Latin accents start sounding like mush. And here, the orchestra does get in the way. An opportunity for one of Ms. Krall's superb piano solos is filled instead by some unimaginative strings.<br />&quot;Cry Me a River&quot; is mostly homogenized glop, all so floaty that the mix of her voice and instruments are a flat melding of sea and sky. Her precise enunciation and phrasing on this and other songs almost sound condescending like &quot;Let me spell out the emotional meanings for you.&quot; Lush, relaxing, yes, but it sounds at best like background dinner music, and at worst like bedtime music when you have the flu.<br />Other nice but unexciting vocals follow (e.g., &quot;The Night We Called it a Day,&quot; vocally uninspired and bereft of genuine feeling). At least this song features some excellent piano and builds tension.<br />One of the better songs is &quot;Dancing in the Dark,&quot; featuring good Doris Day-like clarity, and excellent, complementary playing between piano and orchestra. The playing, the tension, the dark undercurrent, the mystery all fit the song. There's some sweep and emotion here.<br />The big exception (other than S'Wonderful) is her version of &quot;The Look of Love.&quot; If you've been lulled into a soporific state, this song will awaken you with a surprised &quot;Who is THIS?&quot; It's Diana Krall at her best, inventive, husky and sultry, the potency of smoke and scotch. It's what we liked on her last good album, &quot;Love Scenes,&quot; the assured, risk-taking vocals and the spare, intimate jazz backing.<br />Again, the problem with the CD isn't the strings so much as the one-dimensional orchestration, the lack of intimacy, and a overall similarity in sound, vocal approach, and tempo. Often, Ms. Krall sounds overmiked, with a resulting diminishment of her generally superb tone, dynamics, and coloration.ocals follow (e.g., &quot;The Night We Called it a Day,&quot; vocally uninspired and bereft of genuine feeling).

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is a neatly packaged fable, great fun for the whole family (unless you're squeamish about muted potty humor). The animation seems so real at times, it's difficult to believe that scenes were entirely virtual. <br />Technical marvels don't make a great movie, however. Fortunately, Shrek has plenty of soul. Myers &amp; Murphy play well off each other, bringing to life a fable about love, integrity, and acceptance. <br />Hard to imagine a more enjoyable picture. Earns every one of its five stars.<br />(If you'd like to dialogue more about this review or movie, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above and drop me an email. Thanks!)
B00004VVNB|3.0|I rate Logan's Run a Sci-Fi classic and eagerly awaited the arrival of my DVD. Imagine my disappointment when I saw the packaging. It is partly made of cardboard and looks pathetic on the shelf beside my other DVDs in their standard size plastic boxes. Shame on the manufacturers for squeezing every single cent out of their production costs of this DVD. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the movie again, even if this time around some of the sets are showing their age, or is that me?
B00004XQ83|5.0|I'm not really a country fan, but album simply stands out. I heard the songs while watching the movie, and now I have the soundtrack with me. A great soundtrack for a great movie!
B00004R960|5.0|Oasis--probably one of the best bands in the world puts together another awesome album. Noel Gallagher one of the best guitarist ever writes more in depth with his new line up Gem and Andy, which replaced Bonehead and Guigsy in 99'.  The album is great, it starts off with a straight music track with loud guitar riffs and hard beat percussions.  Go let it out is spectacular and the rest of the album follows up on it. You have just got to buy it.  I am a huge fan and believe its a must for the collection!
1878424319|5.0|I found this book very inspirational and highly recommend it.  I agree with some people that it is somewhat overly idealistic but I think that is a minor point.  A more practical version of the 4 Aggreements is Regan's The Evolution of a Warrior - another excellent book with themes of personal evolution.
B00005Q4GA|1.0|This is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I;m not sure why but the plot just never hooked me and it was waaayyyy to un-realistic. Take MI2 for exaple. It had to do with money whording pharmacies that make a virus and a cure to rake in the cash but Tomb Raider... it was mostly Angelina Jolie nude or half nude shooting some one to get a key to a time machine. WHOOOO!! a time machine. Sure.. Even the 9th gate was better than this movie. So if you like Angelina Jolie it was great!
B00000INEX|5.0|Baby Bach was such a blessing. My Daughter loved for me to nurse her with Baby Bach playing in the background. I played it so much I wore out the tape. I then bought Baby Mozart &amp; was very disappointed. My daughter did not respond as well as she did with Baby Bach.  Bach was much more soothing and Mozart seemed to wind her up. I'm expecting a child in Feb. and am playing Bach to him now.<BR>To sum up my opinion, I loved Baby Bach &amp; recommend it highly for parents to help their little ones relax before nap or bedtime.
B00004XONN|4.0|i got this cd after of course, being blown away by ok computer..<BR>so there i was,with a brand new copy of kid a in my cd player. from the first track to the last, i was sayin ,'what the hell is this crud?'. but then again,that was on the first listen.. after a while, everything WILL be in it's right place! i'm not sayin this will eventually be an easy listen;if it ever become,well congratulations, but you will eventually learn to love this strange fruit,and even perhaps try to introduce your friends to radiohead with it
0782008119|5.0|This video is the best (and probably only) look at the madness and silliness surrounding all the HYPE of the Northwest music \\"scene.\\"  It was because of this documentary I looked deeper into all the great bands from this area (and not JUST from Seattle.)<br />I only wish it were longer.  Like any great movie, you don't want it to end.  You'll discover some great bands and songs (i.e. Supersuckers, The Gits, Mark Lanegan, etc.)<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Well, I finally saw SHREK. Let me tell you, I'm not too keen on animated films but SHREK is an exception. It is a totally awesome movie. The plot is great, the amimation is top notch, and it's hilarious. Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), and Camron Diaz (Fiona) are a perfect fit for this film. Their voices are superb for the characters that they portray. The storyline basically goes like this: Shreck has to rescue a princess in order to have his home restored. SHRECK is also loaded with jokes and a few surprise cameos from fimiliar characters. Get the DVD version 'cause it comes packed with some great bonus stuff. I don't want to give anymore away so check it out for yourselves. SHREK is an awesome film that will keep you entertained.
6302150930|2.0|Read this review before you write a book report on Tess of the d'Urbervilles, and I promise I will make it very easy for you. If you're not writing a paper on this book, skip to paragraph 5.<br />First, you have to understand that this film is a Roman Polanski film, not a Thomas Hardy film. This movie, thematically, and with its other devices, stands out like Debbie Harry in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, relative to Thomas Hardy's other works, but it slips in very nicely between Polanski's The Tenant, and Frantic. Since August 8, 1969, all of Polanski's films have really been about Sharon Tate and the Manson family.<br />This is a crucial distinction between Polanski and Hardy. Hardy believed in Fate. Many protagonists in Hardy's novels never seem to get a break; they walk around with a dark cloud over their heads. In Hardy's mind, they are simply fated to run short on luck. Polanski, on the other hand, believes on evil. In Polanski's world, there are people who are so filled with menace, that they can turn an otherwise happy and carefree life 180 degrees; fate has nothing to do with it; one person's life is co-opted by another.<br />For this reason, Alec d'Urberville, who rapes Tess early in the film, is nothing more than an agent of fate in the novel, while in the film he is an incarnation of evil. In the book, he is a minor character. He disappears early in the book only to reappear very late to announce that he has found G-d. In the film he stalks her; he is Charles Manson torturing Sharon Tate.<br />Hardy's Tess is thwarted by fate at every turn: the note slides under the rug; her boots are taken by someone who assumes they are abandoned. By the time she commits the crime for which she is finally executed, she is resigned to fate, and does not even try to run. Polanski's Tess is ruined by Alec, and to a lesser extent by the pudding-for-spine Angel Clare.<br />That Polanski intends his Tess to be a different character from Hardy's is evident by the omission of acrucial scene. (PAY ATTENTION BOOK REPORT WRITERS): In the book, Tess spends one night in a forest stocked with birds for a hunting party. When she wakes up, she finds herself surrounded by wounded and suffering birds, so to alleviate their suffering, she breaks the necks of as many as she can find. This touching and disturbing scene is not in the movie, because it anticipates the ending of the book. At the end (SPOILER ALERT): Tess murders Alec, and is hanged for her crime; thus G-d, or some higher power has taken pity on the multitude of Tess' suffering, and has broken her neck to put her out of her misery.<br />Polanski doesn't want you to feel relief that Tess is out of her misery; he wants you to feel outrage. I have gone into such detail as a caveat. Anyone who puts in this movie in a Thomas Hardy frame of mind will be confused, annoyed, and may feel deceived. Warned, you can slip in this tape, sit back and enjoy Nastassja Kinski's narcotizing beauty, the luscious scenery, and the outstanding camerawork by Ghislain Cloquet and Geoffrey Unsworth, edited by Alastair McIntyre and Tom Priestley. These four are responsible for the I-could-just-step-into-it feeling. You feel thirsty watching people trek along the dusty roads; your mouth waters when Tess bites into a strawberry (I still can't eat one without hearing Kinski say &quot;I'd rather take it from me own hand.&quot;) Your forearms are pumped after watching the milkmaids' endless work. I don't think I can describe how gorgeous this film is; it surpasses words. <br />What's more, the actors do perform well within the Polanski universe. If you have your own ideas about Tess, you'll have to leave them at the door. Kinski shows us a woman who has lived a string of mild abuses that it takes her a long time to process her outrage when she is violated. She shows us a woman timid, because there's never been enough in her life to fight over, so she never learned, and therefore a woman defenseless, but a woman nonetheless with fortitude. Kinski's Tess appreciates Angel Clare's passive rebellion, while other girls are interested only in whether or not he is handsome. Kinski has a lot of screen time relative to the number of lines she has, but Kinski doesn't need to be speaking to be acting; this is a mark of real talent.<br />So see the movie, especially if you like on-location films with lots of panned shots, greenery, thick meadows; really looks like Wessex, even though it's France. But somewhere along the line, you may want to read the book as well; it's really, REALLY good, you can imagine Tess looking any way you want, and you don't miss anything if you get up for popcorn.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I really can't believe I had to pay (dollar amount) for this lemon. I think that if Britney Spears turned to Jazz or traditional R&B, I think that she could sound better.
630420065X|4.0|This movie is great!  The action scenes were filled with action, but were also very clever.  The infiltrations were well thought out and daring.  We get to see all the &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; for a mission impossible team that we love in spy movies.  The story twists and turns to the very end, I will admit I was surprised a couple of times and that is not very common at all.  Overall, this was a great movie.
B000002TQV|5.0|when i was reading up on thsi release, this cd was described by a reviewer as a 'flawed masterpiece'.. ....where? no , really...<br />i've listened to this cd days on end, and after the closing strains of 'street spirit' , i'm still waiting..<br />some people think that ok computer is much better,but i disagree, in a sense.. they're two different albums, different fomulas altogether,and have to be taken in those context.<BR>the bends as a guitar album,and ok computer as an experimental conceptual kinda thing..<BR>here's my list of tracks that keep me going :<br />street spirit, sulk,fake plastic trees,the bends,black star,high  and dry...<br />the others ,while by no means mere 'filler', fit between marvellously.<BR>truth be told, i bought this album on the strenth of street spirit alone, but the entire cd is worth it
B00004Z459|5.0|This is such a sweet cd for anyone who likes hard rock and punk. If your not into that this isnt for you.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Who COULD NOT like Shrek? Especially with the voice of Mike Meyers!!!! My dad bought this as a &quot;family-movie&quot; last night, and this is one movie I actually LOVE. It's one of those movies you can NEVER get sick of, and with all of the humor and incredible animation, its not hard to see why everyone loves this movie.<BR>The DVD is especially fantastic. There are two CD's, and plenty of special features like Shrek's Karaoke Dance Party (my personal favorite) and Games you can play. If you have XBOX, they have cheats on the 2nd CD for the Shrek game. <BR>It is simply amazing what they did with this movie. If you haven't seen it, then you're crazy!! This movie must be rated movie of the year. It's extraordinary!
0783113943|5.0|Gia. One word says it all. Real life story of tragic supermodel is the best film i've ever seen. Beautifully written and directly with absolutely fabulous music and photo shoot montages not to mention the acting which is incredible. Gia's mother is wonderfully portrayed as a typically east-coast neurotic not all there mother. Lynda is played so realisticly i doubt that i can even consider any woman straight again. Every supporting actor on screen is wonderful. But of course the reason why this movie is so good is Angelina Jolie. An amazing actress in an amazing movie shines as bright as any star around. Carrying her role through the highs and lows of Gia which were so draining she EARNED her place in the hollywood elite. The story itself is an extremely remarble one drawing from real life, real people and the diary of the main character's namesake. A profoundly tragic flim which should not for those who cry easily. Don't rent this film if your in the mood for a feel good comedy! This is a film that requires a box of tissues!!! Simply my favorite film of all time.
B00005AACC|3.0|I liked this movie, but it didnt live up to the first Mission Impossible.  The action was good, with a great motorcycle chase scene towards the end.  The villian was good and despicable.  The effects were good.  But it lost the magic that we expected after seeing the first MI.<br />The thing that I liked the least was the totally unbelieveable relationship between Ethan (Tom Cruise) and the main woman (I forget her name which should tell you something).  They just went from flirting to &quot;in love&quot; way to easily for my tastes.  It seemed laughable.
B000002U9L|5.0|What to say... hmm.. Well, this CD is so damn good it's very hard to describe!  There's no particular style to class it under, either... but this soundtrack seems to tell a story in itself, with the wonderful music of Trevor Jones and David Bowie.  Both the instrumental and vocal pieces are not usual of late eighties music, in that they really aren't cheesy at all.  You don't even need to see the movie Labyrinth (although you should) to appreciate the great music that comes along with it. If you have seen the lyrics, listen closely, as they reveal more about the characters... specifically Jareth.  This wonderful CD is a mix of rock 'n' roll, almost-techno/trancey stuff and even some rosta-ish stuff (Chilly Down).  Great for all ages, too.
6304401132|5.0|Any original Walt Disney production, is always 100% wonderful -- true masterpieces. Sleeping Beauty definitely falls into this category. Echanting scenery, and story. Sleeping Beauty, Aurora, is indeed beautiful, and the voice and singing of Mary Costa is superb. And listening to the music, is it any wonder that the magnificent score was nominated for an Academy Award? This is a must see for anyone, any age, any time.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This film is absolutely wonderful.  I enjoyed every minute and every aspect of it, from the performances to the depressing scenery and terraced housing of Billy's town.  Billy truly shows that you must really really try to do what you love, even if it looks like you may not make it.  He grabs on to his talent and lets him take him amazing places.<br />You know you're watching a true British film when 1) There's a miners' strink involved and 2) when you have to put on the subtitles to understand you're own language because the  northern accents are so thick that you can't understand them as well without them.  &quot;Snatch&quot; was like that too.  To understand Brad Pitt, you've got to have subtitles.  I mean to be humorous here.  I truly love this movie and I hope that you'll give it a chance.  Its great!
B00003CX5A|5.0|Oh, my what a film.  New view of an old classic.  This picture draws you in, and never lets go.  It's nice to see a revival of such a wonderful story.  Christina Ricci is marvelous as Katrina, and Johnny Depp provides a fresh take on Ichabod.  Probably the best of all was Christopher Walken, whose time was short, yet powerful enough to scare this seasoned horror fan out of her seat.  A truely haunting and enjoyable film.
0800128052|5.0|You do not have to love Notre Dame or even football to agree that this is one of the best emotional films ever made.  The main character (Sean Astin) could not have been better portrayed.  A great story, true by the way, is about a typical midwestern youth who from the time he could walk wants to grow up and play football for Notre Dame.  Although his father (Ned Beatty) and his brother don't take him seriously, Rudy gets on the Irish practice squad and gets a reputaion for being tough.  His big dream of suiting up is finally realized and in the closing minutes of the seasons final game against Georgia Tech he becomes a hero.  The final five minutes of the film will have you standing on your seat and you will have trouble keeping the tears from running down your face.  This film is on a par with Brians Song and Hoops.  A real winner and must see film.
0385040253|5.0|... This book is indeed the Bible of knots and ropework. It's entertaining and darn near comprehensive. It's an older book, so it doesn't have a couple of the more modern knots, such as the Zeppelin Bend, and the Gripping Sailor's Hitch. But that's ok! Just do an internet Google search for them, print them out and tape them in the extra pages of the book. If you do that, you'll never need to buy another knot book ever!
B00003CX5P|1.0|Special effects do not a good story make.  From the two-headed comical sportscaster to Jar-Jar stepping in the metaphorical symbol for this movie, Episode I just plain stinks.<br />Here are some of my biggest gripes:<br />Luke wasn't able to strike the emperor in anger or it would have resulted in his turning to the dark side.  Quite a lot was made of this in Return of the Jedi.  Ben killed Darth Maul in anger.  Why isn't he evil now?  This was a major lapse in continuity.  Of course, there's always the possibility that Lucas will perform another round of constructive editing to his original masterpieces.<br />All the mysticism has been removed from &quot;The Force&quot; with Episode I.  The Force now has a scientific explanation--one which raises far more questions than it answers.  If your ability to wield The Force is solely dependent upon microscopic creatures in your blood, then why didn't Ben and Yoda just give Luke a blood transfusion?  He could have kicked Vader's butt in Star Wars.  Instead of sensing The Force flowing within him, they actually give young Skywalker a blood test!<br />Don't even get me started with the Gungan's.  Stupid talking frogs with, what I can only describe as advanced water technology.<br />This movie was created by a man who has been surrounded by lackeys too afraid to offer up even the slightest bit of constructive criticism.  Lucas has lost his way.  If you'd like to follow him on this comical Disney-like romp, then go on ahead.  As for me, I'll remember the first (last?) three episodes as they were--before they were tainted by an old man who's forgotten the child within.  Episode I doesn't exist in my world.  This movie was a disaster from beginning to end.  <br />Major disappointment.
B00005OAIE|5.0|His music is beautiful and he's gorgeous!!  John Mayer has a great voice, and amazing lyrics to his songs!  <BR>He's going to make it big, I know it.
B00005QFHG|5.0|Joanne Harris, the writer of the novel, Chocolat, is apparently a confectionery genius, for this story leaves a wonderful taste in your mouth.  Although I have not read the novel, the movie is delightfully rich and creamy.<br />Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is a &quot;chocolatier extraordinaire,&quot; having the best chocolate in all of France and possibly the entire world.  She and daughter, Anouk, set up shop in a small French village rife with religious zealots led by the mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), who is intent on keeping the town chocolate-less.  It is the timeless game of religious piety versus sincere brotherly love as portrayed in the lead characters.<br />Vianne seeks to sweeten the lives of the villagers in town with her secret panacea, especially the religious rejects like Armande Voizin (Judi Dench).  She is a crusty old woman, the antipathy of her daughter, forbidden to see her own grandson living in town.  Moreover, there is an abused wife (Lena Olin), who finds refuge from her husband, not in the church, but in the chocolate shop.  And finally, if this is not enough to drive a group of religious fundamentalists insane, there is Roux (Johnny Depp), a member of the River Rats, a nomadic tribe of gypsies, who develops an interest in Vianne.  What will become of this little village?  Will chocolate win out in the end, or will the town remain a traditional vanilla?<br />Binoche is sweeter than chocolate in the lead role, and equally impressive is Molina in his role as the mayor.  Judi Dench and Lena Olin put in outstanding performances in their supporting roles as well.<br />This is a movie with substance, dealing with societal issues; and furthermore, showing the power of human kindness and tolerance for those with differing lifestyles.  This one melts in your mouth, not in your hand.
B000002JB8|1.0|Stale , boring, dull, uninspired and unimaginative. <br />I can't see how anyone could possibly enjoy this. <br />This is the same old Vangelis. No. Correction, this is Vangelis with all of his inspiration dried up and hoping to make a few bucks. <br />I gave it a chance. I listened to it several times. I threw it away.<br />If you are a stale, boring, dull and unimaginative person, go ahead, buy this CD. I'm sure you will enjoy it...on some heartless and soulless level.
B000002OOY|5.0|(. . .)I declare, to date, that Jurassic Park stands as John Williams' greatest accomplishment in thematic material. I remember exiting the theatre, swept by images of dinosaurs, and for the first time in my life, humming the tune to the background music. It is beautiful, it is subtle, it so greatly personifies the dionsaurs by evoking their simplicity and the terrifying horror of mankind. It is a miracle that this works so perfectly, since Williams almost defies the rules of film scoring with this album.<br />Every track is listenable and gorgeous: 2, 4, 7, and 16 show the theme in all of its development, and everytime it is a staggering experience; 6 and 12 have that innocence Williams so successfully evoked in ET; 8 is an absolutely amazing undertheme; and the action cues successfully remain unique at all times and are never harsh enough to become unlistenable. In short, this score is a perfect listen from beginning to end, without rest, always with new thematic material and the developed main thematic material coexisting to form a wonderful experience.<br />I would recommend this film score to anyone with even the slightest interest in orchestral music or film scores. It stands out as one of William's greatest efforts to date and, my personal favorite theme of all time. It compliments the movie superbly, and I stand firmly in the belief that its absence would have made the film a failure: it worked THAT well, it was THAT powerful. This is the quintessential Must-Have Film Score!
0140430350|4.0|Rebecca Sharp, although charming and witty, isn't born into the nobility of England. But she is determined that she will become part of it before she dies. Her best frinde, Amelia Sedley, has a sweet and gentle neture. Her only ambition is to be married to a handsome army officer called George Osborne. However, Rebecca flirts with George eben when he is marrived to Amelia. Will the friendship of these girls last ?<BR>This book is quite interesting and attractive, but the beginning is quite boring. I also think that their are too many names in the beginning and this make me confused. I need to read for more times to get the meaning. But this is a nice book for us to read during spare time.
6302206294|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie! It's the best! I did not notice Costner's lack of accent, though I did notice that he spoke real haltingly. The movie took a while to get rolling, but once it did, it was really great. I never thought it was uninteresting. Marion was convincing for the most part, though I don't know anybody that would just stand there and watch Robin and the sheriff fight instead of chucking things at the sheriff's head, but whatever. And yes, it was preety bloody and gory. Kevin Costner's wild hair always made him look slightly dazed (or slightly wild, it's your opinion, after all) and there was some unexplainable stuff (like WHERE did they get all that gunpowder? Azhim wasn't just carrying it around! And where was Prince John during all this?) but overall, it was very entertaining, with a convincing plot and complex situations. Thumb's Up!
B00003CXXJ|1.0|OK, I've not seen this movie.  But JEEEEZZZZ the trailer sucked.  Thanx for nothin'.   Jump &amp; jump hard.
B000002I6T|5.0|There is good music, great music and then there is timeless music.  Everyone who hears this (yep, even the young ones) still thinks it's brand new and hot, says 'Hey, who is that?' and has to run right out to find it.  This is timeless, intricate, mesmerizing, exquisite - still.  You don't need to know one thing about music to love it.  This is for sunsets and sunrises, driving ocean coasts, canyons or mountains, or evenings of good wine and waxing eloquent with friends.  A deep and unchanging well, in thirty years I have never tired of this sleeper - Orleans haunts me - nor will you.  There isn't a bad track on it.  Just as Crosby says, Music is Love - this music.  This is music for when you want to remember to feel feelings; to feel real.<BR>and ... with what's happened in our world since September, in What Are Their Names, the bard drives home to our hearts once again that 'peace is not an awful lot to ask'.
B000002JEV|5.0|Led Zeppelin is one of the most creative and talented bands of all time.  This cd lets them show you just what they are capable of.  First of all, it's live, and with any band of worth this is a very good thin. Then there is the aspect that you get to hear songs off of different albums.  The only one missing is Ramble On, of my favorites any way.  BUY IT NOW!
B00004Z459|5.0|To begin with, this is the best cd i have in my cd collection. i never get tired of hearing this wonderfull cd. in my opinion, linkin park should not be compared to limp bisket because the music is different. its not that different, but it is. i just love this cd so much. i cant wait to buy the dvd, which will be great.
B000021YQV|5.0|Before you read this, be sure of one thing. I don't give 10's that easily. The album IS that good. It's awesome<br />Prison Song: 7.5/8: One of my least favorite songs in the album, yet I still love it. It drags on too much at the beggining, and Serj seems to go off-rhythm just to say the statistics as fast as he can. Although I do love the little background voice saying &quot;I buy my *****, I smack my *****, right here in hollywood&quot;.<br />Needles: 9/10 Gotta love that catchy &quot;HEY!&quot; in the middle of the chorus.<br />Deer Dance: 10/10 One of the best songs in the album, great lyrics, great rhythm<br />Jet Pilot: 8/10 Seems to be known as the worst song in the album. I must disagree. The lyrics either make no sense or are extremely hard to understand the message. Horse? Jet Pilot? But it's a pretty kicking song, very heavy and very metal.<br />X: 6/10  booooooooring<br />Chop Suey: 10/10 The single of this album was wisely chosen. Great lyrics, Serj sings this song extremely well. People can't seem to agree about what the message is on this one, either religion (Jesus talking in the 1st person perspective) or spousal abuse. I think it's the former. But whatever...<br />Bounce: 9/10 One of the craziest and weirdest songs in the album.<br />Forest: 9/10 Great song, filled with emotions and awesome lyrics.<br />ATWA: 9.5/10 I love the chorus. It's a very melodic song, and gets heavier near the chorus. Serj proves that he can sing both heavy and light songs.<br />Science 9/10 &quot;Science has failed our world&quot; How can a song with this message not rock? Serj uses the perfect tone of voice at all parts of the song.<br />Shimmy 8.5/10 Another great song, about how society is teaching comformity to the new generation. It's a short and powerful song, the lyrics might seem too simple, but it transmits the message, and that's what matters.<br />Toxicity 10/10 My favorite song of the whole album (that's saying a lot, since this album is filled with awesome songs) I love the lyrics, the music alternates between slow and heavy constantly.<br />Psycho 8.0/10 Seems to rely more on the catchy chorus &quot;Psycho Groupie, Cocaine, Crazy&quot; over anything else. Songs that rely on catchy lyrics should be less than 3 minutes long (look at shimmy for a good example). The contrast from the heavy parts to the soft parts is too large. Alone they are awesome, but it seems too irregular for my tastes (And I love crazy songs)<br />Aerials 10/10 Wow... I mean, wow... awesome song to end this awesome album.<br />If you like SOAD, you should already have this album in your collection. IF you don't know SOAD, give it a try. If you don't like SOAD, you probably won't after this album. Thank God they know exactly what they are trying to do. They tried to please their fans with this album, not to please the people that don't like them. Always a good thing to do.
B000009EUM|5.0|&quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; is synth-rock at its best.  Powerful tracks like the self titled track, I've Been Losing You and especially Manhattan Skyline are the most powerful tracks on this masterpiece of an album.  I promise you won't go away unhappy!
B000000OA6|5.0|This is an amazing entity.  I must say, however, that it is often misunderstood.  The way this fits in with the rest of Queen's albums is hard to describe.  The album is completely different from anything else queen has recorded.  Yet, it has that queen element in it.  There is still something about this album that tells you it is all queen.  Perhap's if you try to imagine queen's  evolution through the 70s and 80s and then imagine what a millenium of evolution would do to their music you might understand.  The first track, the great title track Innuendo written by all four band members(Mercury,May,taylor,Deacon lyrics are mostly roger's) is amazing.  It starts off in an erie slow rithm some damn fine drums guitar synth and vocals.  The lyrics seem to convey the feel of interpreting humankinds position in eternity.  The song, however, kind of like bohemian rhapsody, changes its rithm and tone and feel throughout.  I'm going slightly mad(Mostly Mercury) is a tongue in cheek humerous but echoey composition.  Headlong(Mostly May)is queen at their loudest.  I can't live with you(Mostly May) has a nice guitar rithm to it.  It Rocks yet pours out emotion.  All God's People(Evolved from Freddie's Africa By Dark) sounds much like tracks from his Operatic/Experimental Rock album Barcelona.  Don't try so hard(all 4, I believe) is a slow song about not trying so hard.  Ride the Wild Wind(Taylor mostly) is a unique track.  It kind of has a very slight electronic feel although it features their hard rocking instruments with a synth only coming up occasionally.  I sure do like its chorus.  Delilah(Mostly Mercury) is about frieddies favorite cat.  It is probably the siliest on the album with a playfull silly rithm.  The hitman(May mostly, I think but maybe all 4) probably ties or maybe even exceeds Headlong in loudness.  It is kind of a tough guy song with a touch of humor.  These are the days of our Lives(Taylor mostly) is a slow song with a loving sounding drum beat.  It seems to reflect Queen's odessy through the years and how life has changed yet stayed the same.  Bijou(May mostly) is guitar with backing synth and a small segment of vocals.  An erily content track.  The show must go on(May mostly) seems like it finally puts the theme of queen's enduring evolution through the years into a song.  This is something very unique.  A kind of sound never heard elsewhere.  Most of these songs seem to have been written for Freddie(Though many people think they are written by him), reflecting on his emotions and entire life.  They are seem to say something about queen and everything their music has done.  An excellent delibrately final album(I don't think Made in Heaven was planned at this point but buy that one too).    You should also see the excellent videos from this album.  Amazing.
B00000K19E|1.0|what exactly is it that people see in this movie?  it's just one more sci-fi/shoot em up flick in the long line of that sad tradition.  far from the plot being all that fascinating or philosophical, anyone who attended college could have written this garbage up as the movie was shot.  and who can actually take keanu reeves seriously?? during all that drivel about 'introducing a reality with no rules' or whatever, i just kept expecting him to break out and scream \\"gnarly dude!\\" the reason people rave about these kind of ridiculous, ephemeral (...) fests is because the rest of the movies out there are even worse and do not bother pretending (as this one does) to have substance. call me too artsy or cerebral, but i want more out of a movie than pointless shooting scenes and busty women, and i would really appreciate it if the director took me seriously enough to do something other than string me along with a sadly fake and laughable attempt at depth or meaning. it really is a sad state of affairs today:even blatantly obvious pretenders to the throne are superior to the norm. this movie does not even work as what it basically is, adolescent escapism.  and escapism, contrary to what the majority think, can in fact be great and even substantive, when it is done the right way. anyone with a little bit of a brain must have been depressed but nonetheless slightly amused as they exited the theater after this atrocity mercifully ended and overheard the lively chat about how deep it was. many of my friends talk enthusiastically about what a profound comment on reality this nonsense is, and i agree in the sense that it drives home quite firmly the reality of everything that can go wrong with a movie. you can just see the directors of these things laughing to themselves privately as the bucks roll in and secretly wondering, \\"what idiot said that you can't fool all the people all the time?\\"
B00005QG9J|5.0|This CD just makes me happy to listen to it. The amazing instrumentation and vocals blend to give a calming, rocking, and unique listening experience. Incubus' music evolves with everything they do, and it's apparent on this cd. It's a good CD all the way through, but I love the hard-rock feel of &quot;Nice to Know you&quot;  and the calming feel and different instrumentation on &quot;Aqueous Transmission.&quot;   This CD is for someone looking for a unique musical evolution from Incubus.
6302859204|4.0|I saw Fire in the Sky years ago and enjoyed it, but the sole reason I dug it out again this year is because Robert Patrick plays a lead role.  I was not disappointed!  Some people have criticized the fact the the story is told from the best friend's point of view, rather than from Walton's, but I think the choice was a good one.  The movie is able to give a more rounded, yet personal view of the case without making you doubt either the friends or Walton.  The acting is wonderful, believable, and, with only a couple of exceptions, not over the top - as is the norm for many alien flics.  Definitely worth the time and money.
630512065X|5.0|Who out there can think of words to describe the pure magic that laces the air surrounding Cats? I'm not even entirely sure *why* such an aura exists, but something...something about Cats is pure magic. There's no better word for it. Those who haven't seen it won't truely understand, and even some who have won't know what I'm talking about. Be forwarned, there is hardly any plot to this masterpiece. If you're the type who likes to have everything handed to you on a silver platter, you probably won't enjoy Cats, and you have my pity. But, if you have a strong imagination and like to fiddle around in a universe rather than just sit back and observe, then more than likely you'll adore it. The characters are strong, but vague enough that you can add your own touches to make them whatever you want them to be. The music ranges from rock to jazz, to classic broadway tunes like the ever-popular Memory. Oh, and a special treat for dog lovers is included in the video! What I'm trying to say is, there's something for nearly everyone with a heart, a soul, and an imagination. Now...and Forever.
6301174240|5.0|Yes...it's a little corny. Yes he turns into a robot....and yes it's filled with homeless children in which he saves from a ponytail wearing Joe Pesci. Plus there's a lot of singing and dancing. But is this not what makes Michael, Michael? That child-loving adorable...cartoon-like character figure that we've all grown to love? I love you Mike, do your thing!
0671578855|5.0|I read the first 11 chapters of this book on the internet (...). I was hooked. I waited on tenterhooks for the book to be released, purchased it as soon as possible and... LOVED IT! I laughed myself silly all through the fateful dinner, party, worried as Miles tried to patch up his ailing lovelife, and marveled at the byzantine turns of Barrayaran politics. If you've never read Lois' books before, this is a great one to start with, because you'll never stop. Each book just get's better, and now MIles is setlling down, it offers a greater scope for 'Milesian mayhem' than ever before. For die-hard Bujold fans, great news. Want to know what happens on the honeymoon? The next book is out March 2002, titled \\"Diplomatic Immuntiy\\". (...)
B000002ULO|4.0|Obviously, during his Beatle days, Paul wrote some spectacular tunes.  Everyone knows the history and accolades the man has from the 60s, and while his solo career also yielded a few memorable tunes, the great majority of his work teetered on songs w/ catchy melodies and daft lyrics. &quot;C'Mon People&quot;, &quot;Biker Like an Icon&quot;? I mean really. But apparently the Anthologies woke Paulie up and reminded him that he wrote The Long and Winding Road and I'm Down because &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; had well written, lyrically meaningful songs on it. The standout tracks, &quot;The World Tonight&quot;, &quot;Heaven on Sunday&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Night&quot; and &quot;Somedays&quot; would have been worthy of some of his Beatle-era work, save for the fact that they still included some of the soppy lyrics that Lennon would have canceled out. All in all, &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; is an album I would rate at the top 5 of McCartney's solo releases. Why? Because for the casual person that knows of his legendary status, this album serves as an excellent example of the work McCartney was capable of, but often did not push himself to. The song styles are enthusiastic and fresh feeling as well, even if they are ones that Sir Paul has traveled down before. Definatly an album worth adding to the collection, I'd say it's a notch below anything the Beatles could have produced in the studio if they were together today.
6304806434|4.0|Well, Con Air is an action film. There's no escaping that. And when the name Jerry Bruckheimer pops up in the opening credits, we know it's going to be a big action film in every sense of the word. <br />Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is a retired US Ranger who, the day of his return, gets involved in a drunken brawl protecting his wife from some local thugs, accidentaly killing one of them during the scuffle. It's not long before he's convicted and sent to prison for his crime. <BR>Determined not to screw up again, Poe spends the next five years or so growing his hair and doing push-ups, from what we see in the opening shots. Eventually he gets paroled and he and his friend, Baby-O are brought on board The Jailbird - a lumbering troop transport designed to fly prisoners around the country. <br />But they are not alone on this aircraft. Onboard are an assortment of master criminals and general nutters from all over the country. There's super-clever Cyrus the Virus (a shaven-headed John Malkovich), black militant Diamond Dog (big bloke Ving Rhames), serial rapist Johnny 23 (greasy Danny Trejo) and creepy mass murderer Garland Green (Steve Buscemi). <BR>Needless to say, it's not long before the cons break out and take control of the aircraft. With Baby-O dying from lack of insulin, Poe is forced to remain on the aircraft and try somehow to get things under control. On the ground, Federal Marshall Vince Larkin (John Cusack) does his best to calm things down and work out just how the hell to stop the whole thing turning into a bloodbath. <br />The plot isn't anything spectacular, but at least it's better than the likes of Armageddon. The first two-thirds of the film are relatively slow, with Poe skulking around the aircraft and generally doing his best to help the good guys without getting himself killed. <BR>It's only in the last half-hour that the film succumbs to the inevitable Bruckheimer influence and disintegrates into an orgy of guns, explosions and even a bit of fist-fighting. Still, the action sequences are solidly staged and competently shot, particularly the battle in the deserted airfield.<BR>The only real problem is that the film just doesn't know when to stop. After crashing an aircraft into the heart of Las Vegas, we're then treated to a fire truck chase through casino's, tunnels and even construction sites, resulting in a totally over-the-top death for the villain. The film reaches a high with the airplane crash, but it keeps going for more and by the time Cyrus is finally disposed of, it comes as an anti-climax.<br />The performances are good rather than great. Malkovich, since his performance in The Line Of Fire, has become the new Alan Rickman - a thinking mans bad guy. He's always ready with a sarcastic remark or witty postulation and he certainly looks nasty enough, but he doesn't really have the presence to carry off the role. <BR>Cage turns in a solid performance as all round good-guy Cameron Poe, but after the likes of The Rock and Face/Off, this film certainly doesn't push his limits as he mumbles his way through his simple-Simon dialogue. Still, he seems to have put in some hard time at the gym for this movie, and wastes little time on showing off his new physique. <br />The rest of the actors are there mostly as cannon fodder or comic relief. John Cusack does what he can in what is really quite a limited role, while Steve Buscemi turns in one of his patented 'Creepy little guy' performances, still managing to raise a few laughs with his occasionally insightful remarks. <br />The soundtrack for Con Air is top class, perfectly summing up the mood of the film. There's a lot of heavy bass whenever one of the villains strolls up (usually in slow motion) and plenty of electric guitar during the fight sequences. The dialogue is rather intermediate, mostly witty and entertaining, but occasionally flat and dull. At least most of the puns are good. Upon seeing a sports car hanging in the air behind their plane, Poe remarks simply, &quot;On any other day, that might seem strange.&quot;   <br />All in all, a good movie with some interesting and stylish touches. Above average, but not a classic.
B000002UB6|4.0|Let It Be has a poor rap, mainly from the Beatles themselves. The album as it was originally intended would have been an UnPlugged album, 20 years before it became the chic thing to do (once again, they were ahead of their time). But instead, listeners have an uneven album; some live studio songs, some live rooftop songs, some overly produced songs, and some bits that make no sense. For example, &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot; were two of the most pointless songs ever to be put on a Beatles record; it would have been better to put some of the Rock N' Roll covers the Beatles did during Let It Be, or even &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;, which was a highlight of the rooftop concert. The album itself serves as a vechicle that shows the heights McCartney was reaching in his songwriting.  The lyrics to Let It Be and Long and Winding Road are in my mind the best he ever wrote. Throw in Get Back and Two of Us, and you have the album's standout tracks. I equate Let It Be to Rubber Soul; the songs Sir Paul wrote on the former were as unmatched as Lennon's on the latter. Still, it is an album that you can get a real kick out of listening to and if only Spector didn't add strings! We could have had the Beatles UnPlugged, and another myth woulda been added to their image.
B00003CWL6|1.0|This movie was a great disappointment: not much plot, lots of over-acting, glib and shallow dialogue.  <br />Definitely did not deserve to win any awards.  Waste of money and time.  <br />Pity the lowest rating is on the scale is 1 star; I would've given it a negative rating.

B00005QHPQ|5.0|I have never purchased an album of Enrique's before, but I loved 'Hero' so much that I decided I should just go ahead and buy it. And what a smart choice that was! I don't know how I have lived without Enrique for so many years! He is so talented and his new album Escape is great for any o fhis fans. The tracks include lots of up-beat, catchy dance tunes and a few love ballads that he sings beautifully. He is definitely unique-sounding, in a good way, and is setting his own trend. Enrique deserves recognition by music fans everywhere so buy this album!
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is really , really awesome. It's not that i only like this heavy metal/rock genre. Quite frankly, i like every type of music, besides country, that is.(heh) This is a review coming a person who likes everything from Dido to Disturbed. rap, rock, whatever, i like it all. This is just a really good CD for anyone who likes any music at all and also has very good taste. Very great work from SOAD that should be enjoyed by everyone
B00005K3LW|4.0|Much like the `Rambo' trilogy preceding it, the `Die Hard' series seems to get even more ridiculously implausible and over-the-top with each subsequent installment! More gunfire, a heavier body count, bigger explosions, and meatier exit wounds abound in `...With a Vengeance', the final (so far) outing in the \\"Die Hard' trifecta. Throw in `Pulp Fiction' buddy Samuel L. Jackson for Bruce Willis' McClane character to play off of, and you've got yet another twist on the well-worn `partners-who-don't-particularly-like-each-other-at-first-but-eventually-do-at-the-end' action flick premise. Oh yeah, let's not forget to add an Englishman (Jeremy Irons) playing a German (like Alan Rickman did in the first DH) as your basic somewhat-arrogant, cold &amp; calculating heavy. Oh, which reminds me: I recommend you catch the first `Die Hard' before sitting down to this one, since the first flick directly relates to this one. And no, I'll not tell you what the relationship is; you'll have to find out for yourself!<br />Anyway, time to discuss the extra features. This being part of Fox's 5-Star Collection DVD releases, you can expect quite a few extras to be included. In fact, there's so many extras that just about all of them (save for director John McTiernan's feature-length commentary track), are on a second disc! Included on this platter are many of the things you'd expect in a special-edition digital disc release: 3 behind-the-scenes documentaries/ featurettes, theatrical trailers &amp; TV spots, interviews, special effects breakdowns and storyboard sequences. Then there's the extra I consider the most interesting: the alternate ending. Although I don't consider it any better or worse than the ending they decided to go with, I found it to be interesting none the less. The different ending here likely would've altered the course of future `Die Hard' follow-ups, if &amp; when they ever see production and release!<br />`Late
B00000IOSU|5.0|To many of Sarah's pure fans this album no doubt was a disappointment. Her foray into mainstream pop culture is a sore spot for her diehard fans from the old days. But let me tell you, as someone who was really unfamiliar with Sarah before she went \\"commercial\\" this album was a magnificent introduction. I bought this album, not for the stuff played on the radio but for what I hadn't heard.<br />Now I am completely in love with her. I went back into her catalog and bought her 1991 release Solace, and it's great too. To see an explanation of Sarah's style, see my review of Solace. <br />But let me tell you about Mirrorball. Contrary to what some of her fans have said, she did not ruin her songs, nor are these lifeless retreads. This is a great look at how a gifted artist can reinterpret her songs and make them new again. This is a super album, but to really appreciate it you need to hear the originals of the songs recorded here. <br />On Mirrorball, \\"Building a Mystery\\" becomes an energetic rock piece, \\"Adia\\" exudes more passion, \\"The Path of Thorns (Terms)\\" becomes more rich and complete. I really like this version of \\"Possession\\": it transforms from a shy wishful-thinking exercise into a swaggering assertion. And the beautiful if quiet \\"Fumbling Toward Ecstasy\\" becomes a beautiful and optimistic anthem. You really believe it when Sarah declares \\"I won't fear love.\\"<br />If you listen to the usual top-40 pop dreck, don't bother digging deeper into Sarah's discography. But if you want some meaning, please, pick up Sarah's earlier work. You *will* see the light.
B000002IG4|5.0|\\"Hello\\" was given to me for my birthday when I had just begun listening to Phil Collins, and after hearing it I wondered why I had ever hesitated to pick it up myself. This CD is an undiscovered jewel in Phil's collection with many enjoyable songs. The trademark percussion-heavy opener, \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", sounds a bit negative, but is nevertheless a good song. What I really can't understand is the use of negative, contracted titles for half of the songs. However, more often than not, they're the most endearing tracks. \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\", is a fun, dancable tune, and no one can keep from snapping fingers or tapping feet when they hear the cool Supremes cover, \\"You Can't Hurry Love.\\" \\"Thru These Walls\\", while a very intriguing laid back number, sounds like a prelude to 1985's \\"Take Me Home\\". The album's most memorable ballad is certainly \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away\\", with Phil's vocals soaring almost from the beautiful piano intro. A jazzy surprise comes with the instrumental jam \\"The West Side\\", his last without words until \\"Saturday Night And Sunday Morning\\" in 1989. And the orchestral closer \\"Why Can't It Wait 'Til Morning\\" is unforgettable. Phil had not quite achieved 80's megastar status with this understated album, but it certainly deserves another listen. It's excellent for a late night drive or a romantic evening at home for two. If you're looking for one of Phil's finest albums with both rock and romance, you simply can't miss \\"Hello, I Must Be Going!\\"
B00003CX8J|4.0|The movie is great even with some flaws in the plot.  The only disappointment is that this DVD release has virtually no bonus material, only trailers, and 10 minutes of cut-out scenes.<br />I expected more.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I first heard these guys on a college radio station in ny. they played like five songs in a row. when i got home i bought both EPs that were available at the time.<br />every last song on both were original and the type of stuff you can listen to a thousand times in a row.<br />i waited for this thier album (this is it) to come out, and after having it for four days i have to say- it is amazing!<br />if i had one complaint it would be that the version of barely legal (track four) is different from the EP and is missing a cool guitar part.<br />Every last song on this disk grabs you. some take longer, but most are right off the bat. This disk reminds me of when i bought nirvana's nevermind when it came out- you know as you listen to it that its a major milestone. <br />I dont want to compare them to other '70's bands, because all that does is illustrate how long its been since truly great  balls-out rock and roll was made, with few exceptions.<br />the strokes have a style all thier own, and i can hardly wait, if they are this good right out of the gate, what they will come up with in the future.
B00004U8P9|4.0|Well here it is again, the glorious Rocky Horror Picture Show with a new edition out after 5 years.  It was great as ever.  Only one flaw I found, which was mildly irritating, was the audience participation feature.  You can go to the main menu and select to have audience participation playing while you view this film.  It would have been fine I think if only 5 or so people had done it, but there were so many people yelling things out at once that you could niether hear what they, or the people in the movie, were saying.  All the other features were good thou, and I found it to be well worth your money.  A great way to view the movie by itself or feel part of the experience.
B00003CY0V|2.0|I feel bad for Travolta. He comes up with one good movie per decade, and this was not his good movie of the first decade of the 21st century. The beginning (first ten minutes or so) of the movie totally captures you. You think: &quot;Oh, my God! This is just like Tarantino...&quot; But then it all falls through the cracks. The plot is very, very weak, and the acting is no better, beginning with Travolta, after he's done with his mind-capturing intro. There are a couple of unnecessary, yet sadly money-making-for-the-studios, sex moments (Halle Berry exposing her breasts out of no reason in one of them, and another one, where the hacker -played by Hugh Jackman- has to crack a very secure network while undergoing some very distracting sexual maneuvers -a plain gun pointed at his face might have done the same trick, I think)... So, not even the nudity and sex-related scenes in the movie fit in with the plot.<br />Finally, while the technical veracity of the hacking scenes can be questioned, the movie does have some really cool effects, but overall, I don't recommend it too much. Get it unless you have something better to watch.
6301967984|5.0|Now, how do we begin? Well, I can honestly say, though this film is disturbing, I wasn't nearly as shocked as I assumed I was going to be. I tried reading the novel by the Marquis de Sade, but I felt it polluted the senses if you gave it too much of your time. I may finish it one day.<BR> The film, on the other hand, is a darkly comic look at fascism through the eyes of...well, the audience. WE are the eyes. This film makes you take absoloutely NO opinion. You aren't swayed either way, you are just sort of stuck there with your mouth hanging open. It makes you feel numb, maybe because you feel as if you're watching a History Channel documentary,or maybe it's because the preversions are presented to you so matter-of-factly. There is no music to signify the heroes, the villains, no tone of camera movements, no dialogue to make one group right or the other wrong, it's just...there. Maybe that is the ultimately disturbing aspect of these atrocities. The film is more of a physical and emotional experience than a viewing experience. I felt repulsed with myself for not being more shocked, but in a time and day where violence IS society, I feel that maybe this only strengthens Pasolini's point. If he had one. He might have very well been the ultimate deciever..make a film that comes across as a message, but in reality is just a handbook for your own passions for nihilism. We may never know, now that Pasolini is gone. But the movie asks one ultimate question. What makes the fascists wrong, and &quot;civil&quot; society right?
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The animation, to begin with, was simply awesome. Yes, the details of Shrek and the donkey are remarkable, but even more amazing is how Dreamworks accomplished such a striking resemblance between the animated characters and their human voices counterparts.<br />It is easily one of the funniest movie of its genre up there with Disney's &quot;Toy Story,&quot; &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot; and now with &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; Ironically enough, a large part of the fun you can have is directly tied to the parody the movie makes of Disney classic fairy tales such as &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Not that it's a slight detail: it's hard not to notice it, but it is highly enjoyable. In addition to this, there is a very original combination of contemporary pop/rock tunes with the scenes of the movie which takes it out of the traditional fairy tale genre.<br />All in all, even with the totally  predictable ending (who cares, after all -it's a fairy tale!) I give it five stars.
6305307261|5.0|Until last night I would have picked Bram Stoker's Dracula as the best Vampire film of all time, but after seeing Herzog's version of this classic tale I was spellbound.  The visual beauty is just about unmatched in any film you'd ever see and the quality of acting is terrific.  A steady pull of tension that seems almost hypnotic and a pleasant little surprise at the ending make this my all-time favorite Vampire film.  I must confess that they have been a secret vice for many years and I've probably seen all but the sexploitation ones and have loved many.  This one is a must see for Vampire fans in particular and stands on its' own in pretty much any film genre, much as one would expect of a Herzog film.  Don't miss it!
B000002UA0|4.0|This album stands the test of time badly.  When I listened to this the first time, I could see myself going &quot;wow, this is unbelievable&quot;, like I used to do about different experimental things in the 60's when I was a kid.  The fact is, it is unbeleivable for that time.  I like music that is daring, experimental, and creative.  I won't say it was ahead of its time, because there were alot of electronic, drugged out music all over the place.  However, the music is very good, and very well written, and very spacey.  I am particularly sensitive to this type of rock.  This is the beginning of Pink Floyd, and, as such, an important document.  The reason I can't listen to it, is the singing is dated.  It has that British Invasion sound.  In order to get to the music, you have to endure the singing.  Really dated.  It just kills the whole experience for me.  When I listen to this disk, I just wish the singer would be cut out and I could listen to the music.  It was great in the 60's, but horrible in the 21st century.  I would buy this disk if you're collecting.  I am going to file it away, and keep it as part of my collection.  Maybe even play it for my friends once in a while to see what the beginnings of Pink Floyd was like.  I just hope I don't have to listen to it too much.  It is totally dated and unlistenable, but relevant as a historical curiosity.
079073382X|5.0|Few films have had any profound impact on me or my life, thus one can imagine my shock when I found this little film and it shook me at my foundation. Maybe it's the result of my having Eurailed partially across Europe with a young Irish girl I met while working at a somewhat remote American hotel in Bavaria, Germany. I will forever remember and cherish the experince I had and this film does an excellent job of conveying the innocence and care-free days of those who are lucky enough to make such a trek. This Irish dove and I had no idea about the future and were unconcerned with the past. We were just there to simply have fun and ride the train. Looking back on those days, a sense of melancholy sweeps over me, leaving me wistful for those long lost days. This film aptly portrays the yearning that we have all felt at one time for something solid, beautiful, and ultimately fleeting. For that, I am moved and grateful.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The nay-sayers are smoking dope to tell anyone that this movie stinks! <BR> It rocks on every level. From the special-effects to the somewhat complex plot, Lucas aquitted himself nicely in delivering THE most anticipated movie-ever. <BR>Here is my response to the non-believers who whined about \\"Lack of character development\\". They are just plane wrongo. <BR> The character development was in the foreshadowing of things to come. Episode 1 isn't a stand alone movie but part of a three act/film whole.<BR> Look at Star Wars. The only thing that really advanced was that Luke got his wish to get off the planet and do something. Solo kinda came around to help someone other then himself there at the end, which is about as far as a SW film as seen in the one chapter story arc department.<BR> You also didn't get to know Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars either.<BR>As I said above, what the cry-babies are failing to distinquish is that Episode 1 is not a stand alone movie. Wait until the next two chapters are out before you whine about a lack of character development.<BR> <BR>Another popular complaint is: \\"Who was Qui-Gon and why was he used more instead of Obi-wan?\\" <br />Who Qui-Gon was is illrelevant cause he isn't the main character of Episode 1. Anakin Skywalker is. Only the realities of the story forced Anakin's debut to happen at the 30 minute mark.<br />But one could say that Anakin dreams of being a champion, someone who mattered, did begin to come true. And the seeds were planted between him and Padme, as well as the soon to fester clash between him and Obi-Wan.<br />The characters to keep an eye on are Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan. Maybe Yoda to an lesser extent.<br />Again, foreshadowing.<br />- Anakin behaved as he did because Lucas was again setting up how much he will change over the next film leading to his downfall. Scenes were deleted showing his inner rage and hatred (as witnessed firsthand by a poor child aged Greedo). <br />Lucas was simplifying the naiveness of youth.<br />\\"Jake Lloyd and most of the acting was bad.\\" <br />Wrongo! <br />It was no better or worse than in the original trilogy. I thought Neeson was excellent. He gave Jinn a quiet nobilty and grace. <BR> Rules should not be apllied to TPM if they are not going to be applied to the original films. . Outside of two \\"Yippies,\\" Jake Lloyd did just fine, especially in the final moments between him and his mother. And all eight year olds act like that.<BR> Star Wars movies have never been about acting. Just look at the post SW careers of Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. This is not Mamet or Shakespeare! <br />\\"But why did it have to pander to the kiddie element so much?\\" First off, these films HAVE ALWAYS been aimed at the kids. They are kids movies and that is straight from Lucas's mouth.  <BR> Oh, like Star Wars and Return of the Jedi didn't pander to kid's humor with all the fart and burp jokes. Let alone all the times where Chewie started acting like a scared puppy or R2 was shocked or shot for comic relief.<br /> If those things are so annoying go watch (***) like \\"The Matrix.\\" <BR> <BR>Another yawn-inducer. \\"Jar Jar was pointless! Why was he in the movie?\\" <BR> In every great quest story there is a friend, sidekick, etc who is there along for the adventure but has no emotional connection to the goal because he/she doesn't understand or believe in it. Usually, they end up being enlightened. <BR> I gurantee all of those idiots who complained about Jar Jar will be crying in their seats, just like when Spock croaked, when he dies a heroes death in Episode 3. His goofiness just shows he has a character arc in store. <br /> Lastly, the most popular and annoying complaint. <BR>\\"The Midi-chlorians de-mystified the Force.\\"  <br /> The whole Jedi myth thing was never looked into in Episode's 4, 5, and 6. Search your feelings, you know this to be true. The only place that it was explored in were the countless mass market tie-in books that you dumbasses bought en mass. <BR> Besides, there are two more movies to go, be patient and see where he takes it. <br />Anywho, forget the stupid critics, they always have a self-serving agenda to push anyway and wouldn't know a fun movie if it bit them on their bums! <br />For all Star WArs fans out there this is a keeper! <br />Go buy the DVD it is outstanding!
B00004Y9PP|2.0|PITCH BLACK could've been the ultimate in the sci-fi thriller genre, but it failed to keep up each end it kept on trying to build on.  David N. Tworthy, writer of THE FUGITIVE writes and directs this film based on survivors from a crash landing on a strange planets where manhunting aliens stalk at night.  This film isn't lit with a descent cast or very great set design, but the concept of the film was meant to literally scare you out of your seat- but it failed to risk it.  Pitch Black stays on this balance, probably because of budget, where the acting and special effects don't qualify for what they are trying get across to the audience.  The aliens look like blobs with points sticking out of them.  There isn't anything real chilling because the film is never dark enough to be &quot;pitch black&quot; and there is never a time in the film where you don't know what is going to happen.  The characters come up with some creativity with lighting to stay alive, but the writer constantly keeps you in a forward slow-motion, and there is no tension that grasps you and pulls you into this world of monsters.<br />Awe-struck, this film is built mostly on its originality of plot working, something most monster films don't contain.  The main idea is excellent, but the way it is played out doesn't go with the flow.  It is hammered down into the way Hollywood wants to throw it together, and not the way the audience wants to see it portrayed.<br />Vin Diesel makes no worthy performance, except for his memorable vision which guides the other survivors through the trail of terror in the film.  He plays the villian/hero role, who seems more like a Terminator than a man.  This film is broadened with unrealistic looking weaponry, strange sets and dramatic events that seem to veer off from a realistic look, and the special effects and alien creatures look like something that could be plumped into a $20 million production.  The film needs more meat on its bones to get the audience more excited, and bring more fear to the screen.<br />The plot is the only thing that holds up to the hype- which really is the most important thing, but when nothing else works... the film is slammed down under a dirty production that needs to go through the motion picture washing machine a few times before its ready for the audiences' attention.  The possibility of a sequel being made holds up the question of whether or not the production team can fix up the mistakes a second time around.

B00003CXZ4|1.0|Christopher Nolan directs this stunningly akward and rather destructable piece of, need I say- waste, about a man who's life changing accident leaves him with a memory disorder- in which he can only remember previously before this accident, but the present and everything afterwards just flies right over his head.  He is obcessed with trying to find John G, the man responsible for the murder of his wife.  Through taking pictures, writing notes to himself, and tatooing his body to remember things, this man's life gets more confusing as time goes on, because to him- time is nothing, and he can't really feel it.  THE MATRIX's Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliono star with Guy Pearce in this deranged thriller.<br />To start off, this plot is so confusing and holds so much, it relies on itself being so non-understandable to make the viewer think there actually is a plot going on.  The point of the film is basically to surpass as something very original, which it is, but the problem is that its originality makes no sense whatsoever.  Sometimes we never know at what point in the film we are because they are constantly flashing back to the past to try to show us an event that took place that (Guy Pearce) can't remember.  Carrie Anne-Moss plays the mistook Natalie, a beaten woman who is trying to help out Leonard (Pierce) solve this case.  There is so much strange build around each character, including the odd Teddy, another man who seems to stick around and pretend to be Lenny's friend.  The purposterous events that take place over and over- like Leonard waking up in the motel and wondering where he is, looking at himself in the mirror, and questioning who people are- even telling the same people over and over about his condition; it gets to the point where you are tired of hearing it.  You are ten times ahead of the film and where the characters are at that you want to just get over with the film.<br />All of these events lead up to a wonderous conclusion, but the problem isthat you can't understand it, and you keep thinking about the strangeness of it after it's over.  All of this is topped off with unique acting, disgusting language used constantly- of course because these people can do and say whatever they want to Leonard and he wouldn't remember it fifteen minutes later anyway.  <br />The cruelness of the film, to its nonsense plot, its characters, and audience is enough to plague the whole idea of motion pictures.  They are meant to entertain, not to poison the mind with film algebra that has no answer.  This technically skilled and wondrous film would work if only it knew when to stop itself, if it could understand the boundaries and tolerances of audiences.  The film is highly skilled with an edge to it that the audiences want, but it is overdone with originality that the film doesn't make any sense anymore.  If only the plot wasn't like playing catch, going back and forth, when instead it should be keeping us in an orderly fashion of the film's movement, we'd all be able to keep up with it.  But as Christopher Nolan has left it, it is a stand-alone which will pit the audience in brain-freeze and they'd rather go see Pootie Tang instead.
0553583182|5.0|The magic of this book begun in the way I found it. I go to the bookstore everyday, and I spend two or three ours. One day I was walking to a section of Filmmaking, and something stoped me in front where this book was, as if someone was guiding my hand and my sight to this book, I took it, opened it, and just by reading a couple of pages I knew this was &quot;The book&quot;. So, I forgot about filmmaking books for that day, and bought this one. As soon as the pages came to me, I realized that my subconscious mind took me to the book. The magic about it, is that God is so powerfull, that He finds the way to guide us where we need to go.<br />What I like about the book is its easy to understand language, and ready to test advice. I can say that this book re awoke in me, the magic we all have. When it says that some healers know they have the power to heal, but they don't know where it comes from, whit this book I discovered why several times something happens like magic and we don't know why. Read the book and trust me. If you open your mind you will get the results. I bought it one month ago, and from the very first day I begun to apply its teachings, and I can say that I have more energy, more entusiasm, optimism, I feel great as a whole. All the time I feel inspired. I want to know how will I be feeling in six months. <br />Try the book. And if for any reason you don't understand it, or don't feel it is making a difference in your life, I ask you to try it, at least for one month. Use its teachings for at least one month, and you'll begin to see the difference. You have to tune with your mind.

0316286850|5.0|This book is a wonderful guide for anyone from a beginner, to the person who would like to try something new.  It gives detailed information about applying make up to each area of the face.  The large size, and full color makes the reading experience even more enjoyable.

B00003CY0V|2.0|This movie start good, and I liked the travolta's speech in the beginning, even that scene when the camera rotate in slow motion around the explosion was interesting. But after all that, you realise this just another stupid hacker movie. But the whole problem is: I don't think the director knows even a little bit about computers, systems, hacking, cracking, all that stuff he loved so much to say from the beginning until the end of the movie over and over again. I had that same sensation (alredy with the movie Hackers) about people being a bunch of retards in front of the computers. Yes, that was the central problem. Look at the computer's screens in the movie and you realise that doesn't exist, it's impossible, nobody works like that, that hacking method is just a fairy tale for stupids to think they know about hacking and computers. Again, people think hackers are connected with punks, sub world, drugs, hookers and whatever, my holy god, that's all wrong, it plays wrong, and even worst, after few minutes the movie lose his interest about computers and turn into a action movie &quot;a la americana&quot;. Believe me, I'm not an hacker, I don't know how to hack any kind of system, even don't know how to make an horse of troia, but at least I know that if you want to understand something, you need study, hard work, and not just stay playing fairy tales, making stupid movies for people to think you're intelligent, because you aren't.<BR>And again, at least, I gave this movie 2 stars, because it was a little bit entertaining. Yes, you can entertain yourself, have some fun watching movies, and I'm not trying to be a dork, but please, after the movie is over, don't forget to put the trash in it's right place.
B00005KB9W|5.0|Live albums are rarely the top choices in a legendary artist's catalogue. They are usually left on the shelves for diehard fans. For every Allman Brothers at Fillmore East or Band of Gypsys, there are about five live CDs disregarded for better studio albums and one that has never even been issued on CD (and about thirty live offerings from the Grateful Dead) and it is often with good reason. Live albums often feature drippy jam sessions, have poor sound quality and reveal nothing new about the artist. But there are exceptions to the unimportance of live material; times when the band hits some inexplicable groove that just does not come about, isolated in a studio, staring at a soundboard. One is this 1975 LP from reggae legends, Bob Marley and the Wailers. Marley's socially conscious pleas fervently ride an intoxicating wave of crunchy beats and gorgeous back-up vocals. One can almost see the beads of sweat flying off Marley's face when he sings his finest mantra, \\"Get Up, Stand Up.\\" Other selections such as \\"Lively Up Yourself\\" and \\"Trenchtown Rock\\" equal its heights of passion, while \\"Burnin' and Lootin,\\" and \\"Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)\\" sink into a hypnotizing, mellow wave. Unlike many other live performances, all songs are captured in clear, crisp almost studio quality sound and never outstay their welcome. Marley neophytes traditionally choose the greatest hits collection, Legend, as a starting point. It is a fine disc, but if you truly desire Bob Marley and the Wailers captured at their best, Live! is a must buy.
B0000024K1|5.0|I'll begin by saying that I in no way profess to be an afficianado of rap music. But I'll add to it that I think, like all true originals, Public Enemy defies labels. &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot; blends street thyming, sampling, politics, humor and good old-fashioned righteous anger in a memorable piece of work.<br />Anger is the emotion that drives the album, and I find myself not agreeing at all with some of the politics that Chuck D. and the rest of Public Enemy espouse. I don't share their admiration of Louis Farrakkhan or the Nation of Islam. I don't believe that &quot;devils&quot; control history. But oddly, I don't think that Chuck D. does either. Public Enemy strikes me as a group of individuals far too individualistic and clear-sighted to buy into any single unifying theory of history or anything else.<br />Most of all, they're angry on this album that their music was rejected by most of the staid radio stations -- black and white -- of the day and who can blame them? The band had more originality in the tips of their fingers than nearly any other band I can name. But best of all, they turn the anger into great music, as in &quot;Don't Believe the Hype,&quot; which jabs back at the naysayers who attacked their politics, and &quot;Caught, Can I Get a Witness,&quot; which mocks the idea that they can't sample other artists' work.<br />Public Enemy stays away from the cliched rap topics: drugs, ho's and violence. Their driving passion is to uplift the black community. If their rhetoric at times strays beyond the comfort zone of white America, well, too bad. We all need to deal with that. And it's not as if the band goes easy on black America. If you think so, cue up &quot;Night of the Living Baseheads,&quot; which attacks the crack epidemic of the day.<br />The jazz critic Martin Williams, writing of the free jazz movement, asked in one of his books, &quot;Where's the Melody?&quot; When you listen to Public Enemy &quot;Bring the Noise,&quot; you may ask the same thing, but the answer is to listen in their words and their sounds to the rhythm of the streets, the rhythm of reality. Public Enemy is one of the true commentators of our times.
B000002UA0|5.0|Out of the many fascinating, luminous pop stars that came out of the 1960s, one of the most popular today is original Pink Floyd frontman, Syd Barrett. Listening to the band's debut and their first masterpiece, largely penned by Barrett, 1967's The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the reason why he is so appreciated is made apparent. His talents are utterly irreplaceable. Barrett was no poetic visionary, like Bob Dylan, or musical genius, like Jimi Hendrix, but he had this incredible knack for creating catchy, unmistakable pop ditties with a dark, acid-soaked underlining. It was like a mutated version of the gift with which Brian Wilson or Ray Davies were blessed. The songs on the Piper at the Gates of Dawn are almost cute; almost fairy tales if not for some dark underlining. Sometimes it is delivered musically (Such as the clanky drum beat of \\"Scarecrow\\" or the minutes of lost cohesion on the quasi-surf rock instrumental \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\") and sometimes lyrically (such as the absent mother in \\"Mother Matilda\\" or the dandelion, which is forbidden to touch in \\"Flaming\\"), but a heady weirdness is always present. Like the boat ride scene in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, an ambiguous idea that something darker, more psychedelic than mere child's play was occurring permeated through Floyd's early work. Barrett had the gift of getting that feeling across more creepily and unforgettably than any songwriter of the 60s generation or since.

B00005O3VC|5.0|\\"MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL\\" (Columbia Tristar) is the kind of movie that should come with a pack of Depends because the odds are very high that when you watch it you'll wet yourself.<br /><br />Certainly among the funniest of all films, this bawdy, unhinged, send-up of a classic British myth (and spiritual metaphor for human redemption) takes no prisoners in its quest for laughs at any cost. Well, not really any cost because it was filmed on a ridiculously modest budget.<br /><br />Under the direction of Pythons Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, and written and performed by the entire ex Oxford troupe -- Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin -- the boys deliver their unique brand of haute silliness wearing armor and pretending to ride horses as they scamper across the timeless English countryside locations.<br /><br />This is the second DVD release of \\"Holy Grail\\" and it's fully loaded. Not only does it have 24 seconds (yes, 24 seconds) of additional footage, it features a terrific audio commentary by surviving Pythons Gilliam, Jones, Cleese, Idle and Palin. The two disc set features wiggy sidebars that include intelligent and fitting subtitles taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV part II (for those who don't like the Python's dialogue), three mindless sing-alongs, a documentary by Palin and Jones: \\"The Search for the Holy Grail Locations,\\" tons of Terry Gilliuam's wonderful sketches, and \\"a load of rubbish -- a surprise package of mystery items specially included for the mentally challenged.\\" And much more in the same vein.<br /><br />These days, it seems laughs are harder to come by, and this 26 year old 89 minutes of inspired lunacy is a must have. Like the protesting plague victim says as he's carted off, \\"I'm not dead yet.\\"<br /><br />Watch this outrageous film and be grateful for the most fundamental of all gifts. Life and laughter.
B00000IPAX|5.0|if you luv the likes of Sum 41, New Found Glory, FenixTX then you'll love this even more! I'm one of Blink 182's biggest fan and reckon this is better than Cheshire Cat, Dude Ranch and Buddha! If you love Enema of the State then I reccomend you buy The Mark, Tom and Travis show! Which has most of the songs on this album live and it'll give you a good laugh!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The single most entertaining and successful film of the year \\"SHREK\\" (DreamWorks...), arrives on DVD in a double disc set that includes widescreen and full screen versions and bonus material skewed towards younger kids. The unusually sharp digital transfer is about as good as is technically possible and brings to life a beautiful world inhabited by all manner of questionable but mostly lovable characters. Mike Meyers' inspired voice work for the title ogre is dead on in every aspect and implies much more humanity than even the words he says.  Eddie Murphy is consistently in the zone as the up-beat, bluntly honest wise guy Donkey. Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow bring the princess and the vertically challenged king to life.  But the most interesting thing that looms over this hugely successful film is the personal war between Disney's Michael Eisner and DreamWorks' \\"Shrek\\" producer Jeffrey Katzenberg. The rivalry and bitterness between the two former Disney associates has resulted in several extraordinary animated products that are probably much better than they might have been.  Let's hope they keep competing on a personal level because \\"Shrek\\" is just about perfect.  Of all the bonus material, making of stuff and commentaries, the thing that's most lacking is something, anything, from the two brilliant writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. It's the best screenplay of the year.  By far.  One to own.

6305014140|4.0|This is THE clasic Ninja Anime. The story is pretty usual the traditional swordstory but it works out good. Even that the end is.... hehe no spoiler here.<BR>Unfortunately the DVD was one of the first to produce and you hear it. The 5.1 sound has its light problems on 2-3 places, it gets a bit crispy but it is ok if you are not a hardcore high-end show lover. It is still amazing that they made this old movie into a 5.1 DVD.<BR>3 stars for the story and one for the DVD it self, nice extras and a good picture, it looks like they used the master to made this DVD.To bad the sound has its problems
B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M. has always been a band whose concerns in making music is about writing good/memorable songs and this collection is at their finest hour!  Every single song ranges from good-to-fantastic!  Everything has already been said about this album,so I'll cut to the chase.  I HIGHLY recommend this album to EVERYONE! (R.E.M. lover, hater, or just someone who likes music!) Listen once and be amazed!
B00003CXXI|4.0|While my husband and I both really enjoyed this movie, there was some foul language that I think that a children's movie can do without. My two-year old didn't catch the undertones and language and really loved the movie but if you have an older child, I am sure that they will pick up on some of this.Other than that, I thought that it was a great movie and had a good message. Just rent with caution. This is rated PG not G.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This album is definitely a step up from &quot;...Baby One More Time.&quot; It's obvious that Britney's grown, and is no longer singing about &quot;Soda Pop.&quot; She knows she's hot, and she displays it in every song on this album. Whoops, she did it again, she made another album w/several #1 singles! Luck? I think not...
0792836634|4.0|I like gory films and this movie was not that. Chucky didnt do much only bite a lady, take control of a car, and attack john a voodooist. Thats is about it. He doesnt talk until the last half hour of the film and the beginning keeps you waiting and waiting for something to actually happen. It recieves and R rating for Language, (especially) and some gore. I like the part when he makes a mojo doll of John. Chucky does come back in more sequels even bloodier than than the 1st. Ok ok, i left out the story line. The story line is a strangler, Charles Lee Ray is gunned down ina  toy store and he wasnt ready to die. So he uses his voodoo skills to transfer his soul into a good guy doll.It all works and he is then bought by a good guy fan, Andy Barclay. He trys to take possesion of Andy's body by the heart of damballa. Its pretty good, and really funny
0780619609|5.0|Ninja Turtles 2 was an excellent movie in my books.  In fact I believe it was even better than number 1.  The only problem i see with it is... IT ISN'T ON DVD!!! I went searching for it this weekend to add to my collection, and low and behold... it isn't on DVD!  That was dissapointing, but back to the movie.  This movie is awesome, in that it shows the beginnings of the turtles, and then to make it even better, they add VANILLA ICE in there.  Put simply, great plot, great writing, GREAT MOVIE!
3257229534|4.0|This book is worth the read; if not for the story itself, then for the situation it puts the reader in: &quot;What would I do if...?&quot;  The author has written the book in mainly the first person, like a memoir, so there is very little actual dialogue between the characters.  I find this aspect rather apealling. The author takes the reader on a journey with the 15 year old Michael Berg &amp; his 36 year old lover, Hanna.  One day Hanna disappears and Michael has to wrestle with the question of &quot;why?&quot;.  He goes on to become a law student &amp; unexpectedly discovers that Hanna is now on trial for a Nazi war crime. What happens after that is a series of unanswerable questions that Michael has to deal with and he doesn't seem to get any satisfaction one way or the other.  The ending is both bittersweet and sad.  The German version of this book is not extremely difficult to understand, but German students will probably want a dictionary just in case.
0425180638|2.0|This book is the most tiresome of Cornwell's series.  As always her explanations of medical procedures, evidence examination, autopsies, and etc. are incredibly educational.  This is truly her art.  However, the story line falters all the way up to the finale which does give this &quot;read&quot; a measure of redemptive value.  This was her only book that had me wanting it to end out of sheer fatigue.  I was tired of hearing about her depression, oppression, and ostracision.  I wanted to reach out and smack the old doctor.  Being Italiano myself I truly enjoy her &quot;preoccoupation&quot; with the culinary joys of cooking, eating, and the sanctity of a traditional Italian meal.<br />This book leaves a lot of room for another sequel as I'm looking forward to seeing what happens to the &quot;nasty boys&quot; of this edition.<br />Keep up the integrity Dr. Kay and start listening to Marino more often, will ya?!  Don't be such a &quot;Testa de Gizo&quot;  (head of cast iron)!!!
0375707972|4.0|This is a quick and easy read...(I finished it in a weekend and I consider myself a slow reader).  It is written almost completely in the first person with very little dialogue between the characters.  The book chronicles a teenager (Michael) and his journey through life, from a passionate love affair with a woman who is 21 years his senior (Hanna) and his life following that affair.  Michael wrestles with the feelings that he has for Hanna and what he can/should do about them. Hanna disappears one day and the next time he sees her, she is on trial for crimes committed against the Jews.  She refuses to defend herself because she is guarding another secret that she is ashamed to admit to.  Michael discovers this secret (I'm not going to give it away!) and realizes that she can get a lighter sentence if she tells it to the court.  Michael again wrestles with feelings of helplessness; he doesn't know what is morally correct...should he tell the court what Hanna is hiding or should he allow her to condemn herself?  This book deals with questions that would be difficult for anyone to answer.  The ending is bittersweet and sad; it will definitely leave an impression on the reader...
014028009X|5.0|I will admit that when this book first came out, I thought it was about a model. Then a friend told me she loved it, I read it and laughed so hard!! I saw the movie in the theater, loved it, and of course I now own the DVD. Fielding writes with no holds barred, not afraid to put exactly what she is feeling in ink, and as it turns out, she is pretty much right on just about everything. All women obsess over their weight, why that guy hasn't called, if they look fat, and why is everyone else happy but me?! Bravo, Helen for writing one of the best and funniest books I have ever read. It is now one of my top 5 favorite books of all time.

0440224764|5.0|The Partner by John Grisham, a fictional novel, is a compelling story of law and escape.  The story flows in a unique way that keeps the reader turning page after page.  John Grisham was not only vivid in the sense that one could actually see the events, but also he presented his fictional story in a way that one could feel, touch, and smell the thrill and excitement that John Grisham endlessly provides. When a book is chosen either from a library or a bookstore, the reader usually examines the book by reading the summary or a caption on the back of the book jacket.  On the back of The Partner only two simple but effective sentences are printed,  \\"It began when he disappeared.  But it didn't really start until they found him....\\".<br />Patrick Lanigan, also known as Danilo Silva, is living in Ponta Pora, Brazil after making off with 90 million dollars from the law firm in which he was a partner. The unusual part of this scheme was that he accomplished this action several weeks after his alleged death in an explosive car crash; nothing more than ashes remained. (...spoiler)  As one can see, the two simple sentences on the back of the book summarize The Partner well.<br />What captivates a reader's interest is not only the novelist's ability to write in an entertaining style, but also to create a meaning for the reader to interpret.  Mr. Grisham's message revealed that at some point in everyone's life one has the desire to escape responsibilities and, perhaps, start life anew. The author of The Partner showed his readers that, in reality, a barricade stands between you and the utopian desire for a worry free existence.  Mr. Grisham also has an  obvious moral- no one can escape the law, and not pay the  consequences.  As it has been said, \\"You can run, but you cant hide.\\"<br />The Partner is a \\"two-thumbs up\\" read.  The author's style captures his audience.  It is defiantly a page turner.  The mystery is unique and the reader is lured into the plot.  However, a few minor flaws keep this novel from becoming a masterpiece.  The over abundance of characters causes confusion for the reader.  In addition, the professional law terminology at times makes it difficult to decipher the plot.  Also, the conclusion is too brief, and leaves the reader dissatisfied.  Nevertheless, I recommend this mystery thriller to all readers that enjoy an exiting mystery.  The Partner is a captivating read and one not to be missed.r flaws keep this novel from becoming a masterpiece.  The over abundance of characters causes confusion for the reader.

B0000029DD|5.0|I recently posted a review saying that 'Everclear' by American Music Club was the greatest album by the greatest band of all- time,and I stand by that,but this is even better and is close to being the best album of all-time.<BR>You could start with the mythology of the father,Tim(the greatest singer of all-time?How much hyperbole   ?)but Buckley senior never released an album this realised,this near-perfect.<BR>Each song on this album is unique and the only difficulty the album has is accomodating the different styles,the different moods,the different textures...without losing coherence.Don't worry,it all hangs together,it all ultimately(I hated 'Corpus Christi Carol'for ages...)makes sense.<BR>'Last Goodbye' is the most immediate starting point and contains probably the album's great rock 'n' roll moment(y'know,like Nirvana Unplugged when Kurt Cobain is lost in the song,screaming his heart out-literally-during 'In The Pines'and then he stops short,eyes wide open realising where he is...and then closes his eyes and goes back into the song...)where during the middle-eighth(whatever that is...)Buckley basically shows off his falsetto swoops before letting loose this gutteral high-pitched and getting higher scream before the song races towards its conclusion.Perfect.<BR>The cover of 'Halleluhjah' is unbelievably moving...and quiet.Lilting and bruising.Poetry and guitar.<BR>'So Real' was added as an afterthought almost but what an addition;disorientating verses lead to that soaring chorus and everything makes sense.<BR>I have this theory that every major album has to have a song that is the centrepiece and this is no different...'Lover,You Should Have Come Over'is the single greatest song of the nineties with the single greatest line('It's never over/All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter...')and it reminds me what music is about,what music can achieve, by which I mean transcendence,just being taken out of the everyday, even if that sometimes hurts...<BR>The album ends with 'Dream Brother',a song ,not written about,but directed to Tim,the absent father, and the final line is &quot;Asleep in the sand with the ocean washing over...&quot; and you don't need me to tell you how this story ends...<BR>Beautiful,beauty forever.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This albulm has to be (if not the best) one of the best albums i have ever listened to. It turned me into the biggest Manson fan. I know... well everything there is to know about him and think is is one of the must misunderstood people there is. Well anyways this album completely is amazing. It provides everything from the heavy industriel sounds of Angel with the scabbed wings to the metal sound of The reflecting god and even the morbid depressing sound of Man that you fear. This album is godly and even if u dont like the guy (fat chance u even have the right to be angry with him) the music in this album is everything u could hope 4. If u want my opinion (well your reading it now) I say get it. Not just cause i like him its because i think u will to , so all and all get the CD its kiks
B000021XS0|5.0|When Dream Theater started, they could play really well, but their music just didn't have the composure an appeal that it needed to make it in the music world.  With 10 years and five studio albums behind them, they are (to me at least) the best band out there today.  It is sad that they aren't more widely known (in America, that is).  This band is comprised of five of the most talented musicians that have ever lived, and they can do nothing but make great music.  After their previous album (&quot;Falling into Infinity&quot;), I had high hopes for Dream Theaters next album, and it certainly fulfilled those hopes.  I believe this is the best concept album of all time, except maybe for Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;.  The story is excellent, the music is fantastic, and the singing is powerful.  Nothing about this album is bad.  This is my favorite album.  Every time you listen to it, you hear something you didn't hear before.  No other album has ever been like that to me.  Buy this album
1878424319|5.0|A good friend lent me his copy to read, he knew that I would find the book interesting. Well, I read it in one day, I couldn't put it down! I then ordered all Don Miguel Ruiz books! This book has touched me in so many ways, I have my own copy and I will always refer to it. I believe spirituality is much deeper than any religion can be. Totally inspirational book...
0345413377|3.0|It doesn't please me to give this book 3 stars, especially after reading the previous 2 novels in the trilogy.  Like many of the 3 starred reviews, I was offended by the portrayal of God in the novel as a withered non-entity and of Christianity as a &quot;mistake&quot; gone too long.  However, my sense of offense has subsided somewhat because the God Pullman has drawn is so out of touch with the God I know that it is possible to see this as an ineffectual deity.  Like another reviewer said I believe Pullman doesn't have the courage to really write God as he is and instead created this being.<br />The last part of the novel redeems the book.  It returns to the roots of the beginning of the series however it is hard to ignore the mess that occurs in the middle third of the novel.  Moreover, Pullman doesn't suggest anything new to replace the defrauded Church.  The angel Xanthippe simply suggests that people should be nicer and less cruel, but what's the motive behind that if the after life only results in oblivion.  <br />Like others have also mentioned, Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter's personality change made no sense.  Lord Asriel in particular was depicted as ambitious, cruel, and cold-hearted towards Lyra in the first 2 novels.  How did he turn into this self-less person?<br />There's much to dislike but if you have read the 1st 2 books you should read this one.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This film is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. The reason for this is that this film contains so much that has later become standard in movies. The gorgous photography, which looks even better on this magnificent DVD, the acting, dialogue, music, story, special effects. Everything about this movie is done perfectly. When one sees this film, it seems as though the film costed almost as much as any high budget film in Hollywood, but it wasn't. Welles planned the film down to each shot, which is why he made those transitions so perfectly and seemlessly. <br />(...)This film, like all films made in the sound period before 1953, was photographed in the Academy ratio, which was 1.37:1. Since the television screen has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, would the picture have minor cuts on the sides. This film, though, is photographed making full use of the width of the screen, so on the Criterion laserdisc version of this film were there a couple of scenes that the extreme left or right side was cropped, but on this transfer have they fixed this. If one talks about that a film that was orginally filmed at a ratio of 1.37:1 would have to be letterboxed to be able to see the whole picture, is that person just being silly. It simply would not be worth the effort, in comparision to transfering films that were filmed in the old Cinemascope ratios of 2.35:1 and 2.55:1 that would badly need letterboxing. But such a picture didn't come out until 'The Robe(1953)', 'How to Marry a Millionaire(1953)' and 'White Christmas(1953)' when CinemaScope and VistaVision was introduced.
6300268985|4.0|There are many long reviews here analyzing every detail of this film.  I will only say that it does become too phantasmagoric and even in its deliberate excess and offensiveness the measure of good taste is a bit lost.  I do think that it's great and entertaining that some scenes are shocking, but when the shots become too fixated on the same thing, it feels like a great joke that is being told too many times - it looses its zest.  To me, Mahler was a better one in terms of being better balanced.  This picture is still a good entertainment, though.
B000001ABD|4.0|I disagree with those who only enjoy the earlier works of Stevie Wonders. This is a great listening, highly enjoyable, and diversely arranged compilation! It has your &quot;get your blood pumping, heart-soaring, soul-searching, and booty-shakin&quot; tunes. If that isn't enough to satiate your taste for music, the univeral language, than you don't like Stevie Wonder. Because, this is very much a great part of his work. I don't feel you'll be disappointed, unless you didn't bother to look at the soundtracks and didn't see the connection between you and the the music. Enjoy!
015626224X|5.0|In Down and Out in Paris and London, George Orwell brings to life the tales of people experiencing poverty in Paris and London. <BR>I thought he beautifully described his life in Paris as a plongeur at Hotel X where he worked in a filthy 110 degree cellar for long hours, only to be paid about 20 francs a day. He had to trade his clothes into a pawn shop just to eat. <BR>In London, Orwell lived his life as a tramp, living in hostels called spikes and suffering from complete boredom. There he meets a man named Paddy, who lives in the spike with him, and Bozo, who teaches him about street beggars.<BR>Overall this was a great book. I love it how Orwell adds true stories from other plongeurs or tramps in order for us to further understand life in poverty.<BR>&quot;It is altogether curious, your first contact with poverty. You have thought so much about poverty-it is the thing you have feared all your life, the thing you knew would happen to you sooner or later; and it is all so utterly and prosaically different. You thought it would be quite simple; it is extraordinarily complicated. You thought it would be terrible; it is merely squalid and boring. It is the peculiar lowness of poverty that you discover first; the shifts that it puts you to, the complicated meanness, the crust-wiping.&quot; -G. Orwell

0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men, written during the great depression, explains, in beautiful detail, the life of two homless men. The book takes place on a ranch in Soledad, California. George and Lennie are the main characters. These two homeless men travel around the United States looking for work. They find it in Soledad. George is small and has all the brains bteween the two friends, Lennie is tal  and slow but &quot;One hell of a strong worker,&quot; according to George. I canit say anymore. They dream of making enough money at this ranch and buy a small plot of land with a small house on it. It's a short book with only one hundered and eighteen pages. It is one of the best classic,s I've ever read, (the others being The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series.) The main and supporting characters are George and Lennie, Slim, Crooks, Curley, Curley's Wife (she doesn't have a name), Carlson, and Candy. I'm not going to tell the end but I will say that it is quite depressing, though a great book.
B00002SWEM|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story of these amazing musicians and the glimpse of Cuba.  Took me to another place and another time.  Unfortunately, the lack of &quot;real&quot; music on this DVD was a huge minus for me.  I wish it was included.  At least as an extra.  In fact, it would have been nice to have live footage from some of the performances.  Even if one has the CD the additional impact of watching these folks perform would have been great.  Oh well...
0380778556|4.0|This book was terrific! I have never read a romance/mystery novel before and I loved it! The book was full of suspense and romance. The book almost resembled a scary movie in the sense that you think you know who the killer is until the very end when you are mystified by a plot twist. I could not put this book down, maybe it was because at times I felt as though I were standing in the room watching the main character or because I was so determined to find out what happened to Rebecca. I highly recommend reading this book! You'll want to read the sequel!
0930289455|5.0|This is one of the first comics to embrace the notion that comics aren't for kids anymore. The story has grit and realism unseen in most titles. The Joker isn't as cartoonish here as he is cunning, evil and without remorse. Batman here is rendered as the ideal counterpart to the Joker, a fellow tortured soul who deals with his own personal tragedy in a decidedly different way. Fantastic story and beautiful artwork. It's a MUST HAVE for any Batman fan. If only they would have used this title as the basis for a script, the audience would finally see Batman as he was meant to be seen!
B000002AS3|5.0|In my opinion this album is superb. But for those who have doubts about Oasis, I tell you this: just listen to Slide Away, Live Forever and Supersonic carefully and I think that you'll change your opinion forever.
1587990717|4.0|I thought the review \\"Critical review from a trader\\" was right on. Rather than repeat a lot of what was articulated above, I thought it useful to point out to others that Mr. Taleb's web site is chock full of interesting stuff . Of special note is Mr. Taleb's positive review of Mark Rubenstien's \\"Picture Book\\" , which I have since purchased and thought was AWESOME. In fact Rubenstiein goes beyond a good read to make learning about derivatives actually fun-SERIOUSLY !!!! . It is a particularly good read after \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" as it details some powerful ideas to manage a portfolio in a sea of randomness. Conclusion, read Fooled by Randomness and then the Picture Book; in that order and you will think about/analyze investments in a far more comprehensive way. Taleb scares you (a good thing) and Rubenstein points you in a direction (a really good thing).
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is just so amazing that I laugh, as I am lost for words to say about it.  All I'll say is Tonight, Tonight, Galapogos, 1979, and Farewell and Goodnight are simply the best songs ever written.  Some say that theres lots of filler, but I feel bad for them since they obviously haven't given it many listens through!  Listen to it all, all the time!  Ahhhhh, why am I writing this when I could be achieving the orgasm it gives me from just hearing it!
B000002KHH|4.0|Although they did not invent heavy metal (that honor goes to Steppenwolf with their classic &quot;Born to be Wild&quot;), Black Sabbath will go down in history as the band that built and defined the genre more than anyone else.  They took the raw power and volume of hard rock, best exemplified in the music of fellow Brits Led Zeppelin, and simplified it, slowing it down by several orders of magnitude and staying in the same deliberate 4/4 beat the whole way through.<br />Paranoid, their second and best effort, took the extended jam sessions of their first album and refined it, giving it a much more audible structure and blasting the bass even more.  Where most bands (especially punk bands) have their bassists play the same thing as their guitarists, Geezer Butler got to have a part of his own, jumping all over the fretboard as guitarist Tony Iommi did his thing.  <br />The album opens with War Pigs, an angst-ridden epic about the injustice in being sent off to die by somebody who's sitting pretty in a government institution, full of some of the most driving riffs in rock history, as well as being the best heavy metal song out there to this day.  Other highlights: Iron Man, with another one of the greatest riffs in history, Hand of Doom, a bass-driven song with a serious outlook on drug abuse, and Fairies Wear Boots, also about drug abuse.  The one exception is Planet Caravan, which is dark and contains good guitar work, but is simply too quiet to have a rightful place on this album.<br />I can't give this album five stars, but it comes damn close.  That says a lot, considering there are only three or four albums in existence that I do award that distinction to (Example: The Wall, by Pink Floyd).  Paranoid easily lands in the top ten of all time and certainly the best heavy metal recording in history.  A must-have for people who know the difference between heavy (Black Sabbath) and speed (Metallica) metal, and recommended for fans of Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, AC/DC,the Who, and post-Sabbath Ozzy Osbourne.
0671024256|4.0|If you have ever wondered at what makes a bestselling author tick then this book may be worth a look. King has produced a guide which is honest, fresh and refreshingly clear from waffle. <br />The book is divided into three main sections, the first of which is autobiographical, covering his childhood, his early struggles to get published, his family life with wife Tabitha and his later struggles against alcoholism. All of this is done with an impressive honesty and you can't help but admire the way in which he brings the characters from his past to life. The second section of the book (by contrast) offers plain speaking advice for would be writers. He covers issues of technique and style, and also talks about how a writer can get into print. The final few pages of the book covers the automobile accident which almost cost King his life back in 1999, and his struggle to recover his fitness and his urge for writing. To close the book, King also includes a short story by an aspiring author, which he selected as part of a competition.<br />If I had any gripes about the book, it would be that this last part tends to gloss over this important part of his life too quickly, giving the book a bit of a lop-sided feel. No doubt, King would explain that the real issue of the book is the writer's art and that in cutting down the last section, he has trimmed the fat and kept us focussed on the important stuff. He might be right. I must say, however, that once he touched on that subject I wanted to know more. <br />Also, it should be noted that the book focusses on writing bestsellers, so the writing style King advocates is not to everyone's tastes. Certainly, I thought that the &quot;prize winning&quot; story which closes the book was rather unsatisfying. However, King's book just edges four stars from me because of its clarity, honesty and unswerving enthusiasm. That last part might just convince you to chance your arm and change career...
B00005JKOV|2.0|An artsy, moody college student moves from scene to scene, encounters a series of talkative characters, engages in conversation after conversation on various philosophical, political, and spiritual topics, and as the circumstance becomes more and more mystifying, our unnamed hero realizes that he's in a dream that he cannot wake up from.  This is the basic premise of Richard Linklater's latest animated feature \\"Waking Life\\".  An interesting idea. <br />The film has a very fascinating visual presentation: shot in real life, and later painted frame by frame by animators with the aid of computers. The result is an exhilarating explosion of visual excitements. An interesting new medium. <br />But, as interesting as the premise and the visual presentation are, this movie rubs me the wrong way. I've always wondered whether or not a book from the \\"For Dummies\\" series can be turned into a film, \\"Waking Life\\" answers my curiosity. After hearing a string of pseudo-intellects having a string of mind-numbing pseudo-intellectual conversations, I am almost certain that this film is based on \\"Philosophy For Dummies\\". Pretentious and sophomoric, the film has the same depth of a first year philosophy major's term paper. I can probably get more philosophy out of an episode of Monty Python than from \\"Waking Life\\".  <br />One of the very loathsome aspects of this film is that it conscientiously tries to be \\"independent\\", and thus corrupts the true spirit of independent films. It rejects the very fundamentals of what make up a film. Sure, independent films are all about breaking the rules and rejecting the norms. But directly reciting passages from a Philosophy 101 textbook is not art; not even outsider art, it's anti-art. Sometimes, we have to admit, the emperor is indeed naked.

6304493681|4.0|&quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot; is the most engaging anime I have yet to be exposed to. I've also seen: &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;, &quot;Macross Plus&quot; (loved it), &quot;Do You Remember Love&quot; (a fave), and...uh, does &quot;Robotech&quot;, &quot;Transformers The Movie&quot;, and &quot;Voltron&quot; (Golion/Dairugger XV) count? Okay, you get the picture -- I'm not exactly a die-hard anime fan yet, but I really do prefer Japanimation to any other kind of animation (seriously!); so here goes my review:<br />I'd heard so much good stuff about this film that I finally decided to rent it, along with 1998's &quot;Dark City&quot; (which was a good decision). The first time I watched it, I found myself resisting the urge to write down technical details like &quot;Section 6&quot;, and &quot;Section 9&quot;, and &quot;MOFA&quot; because they seemed to be important details to remember. The movie ran its course, and I felt a little (no, very!) disappointed. Then I decided to read what others had to say online, and they seemed to (for the most part), enjoy it. Many folks also suggested that viewers watch it at least twice. I decided to watch &quot;Dark City&quot; instead.<br />After watching &quot;Dark City&quot;, I realized that one very cool movie released in 1999 borrowed heavily from both &quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot;, and &quot;Dark City&quot;, and that ground-breaking film was &quot;The Matrix&quot;. From &quot;Ghost&quot;, I feel that (visually) Trinity's character can be likened to Major Kusanagi (sexy, tough, short-haired), some of the combat scenes (pillars being blown away by machine-gun fire), EVEN, Trinity's deadly entrance (the same way the Major makes her deadly entrance). Lastly (and most obviously), the neck interface plugs, and the significance of the internet in this film seem to be elements borrowed for usage in &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Even the open-ended ending reminds me of the way Neo seemed to look triumphantly on his situation with opened eyes...&quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot; ends in very much the same way. (Perhaps both Neo and Trinity owe elements of their identities to Major Kusanagi, or maybe I'm stretching things a little to far...)<br />For those of you who haven't seen &quot;Dark City&quot; or &quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot;, I suggest you see them both. All I will say about &quot;Dark City&quot; is, in that movie, things aren't as they seem, and like &quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot;, the film deals with our perceptions of reality, of our memories, and our souls. Upon my second viewing of &quot;Ghost&quot;, I realized just what everyone was talking about -- &quot;Ghost In The Shell&quot; is a super-cool anime, that raises the bar (thematically) for any anime that aspires to deal with realistic issues. I liked it much better the second time around...<br />Also, I enjoyed hearing the tough-guy vocal stylings of Lunk (Robotech) and Guld (Macross Plus) return in the form of Bateau in this film (Richard Epcar). His performance was the best in my opinion. Vocally, Major Kusanagi could sound very cold and flat, but at the same time, maybe this is the way a hardened cyborg would sound -- so you never know; it may not have been a case of bad acting.<br />Visually, this film is simply a masterpiece. I loved the exquisite art detail presented during the riverboat scene (when we got a chance to look at buildings within the city), and the lines the artists added during monitor screen scenes (tre-cool). In addition, the final battle scene between the Major and that tank is a must-see. Also, the arguably overdone nudity isn't nearly as distracting the second time around; it just serves to add a sense of realism. Same with the elaborately depicted &quot;offings&quot; of the government official in the first scene, and the guy in the car near the end.<br />So all in all, you've just read the review of an extremely satisfied viewer. Next up? You guessed it -- &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;.<br />Thanks for reading!<br />C.H.R..
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A will always be the first album to signify the dawning of the 21st century, all 10 tracks are amazing, thom yorke and the band prove that music can take all forms of expression, ''How to disappear completely'' really describes the human experience and the raw energy that binds us all together, they are the hardest working band in rock today.
6305165912|5.0|This is my favorite movie ever.  There's never been another film that I could just watch over and over like this one.  John Goodman should have won (or at least been nominated for!) best supporting actor.  I have a feeling that after the more &quot;accessible&quot; Fargo, the Academy simply didn't get this one. Phillip Seymore Hoffman (Brandt) is a genious character actor, and this is one of his greatest roles.<br />Didn't like seein' Donnie go.

0767824571|5.0|I consider this a must-have for my collection.  I do wish I would have waited for the special edition, though.
B00005JKOV|4.0|The entire film is rotoscoped, with additional computer and traditional animation added, resulting in a veritable feast for the eyes. Something is almost always moving, and the effect can be somewhat disorienting at times, but that's also the point. WAKING LIFE is about a young man who realizes he's dreaming, and finds he's &quot;unable&quot; to wake up for real. He keeps having false wake ups, crossing paths with one idiosyncratic individual after another between each failed attempt.<br />The story moves largely in monolog form from the people around him. He repeatedly has complex conversations (where he's more getting spoken &quot;at&quot; than &quot;to&quot;) with random people. It feels a little hard to take at first because the conversations are so thick (ultimately that's also their appeal), but I found myself really getting in to it after the third one, or so.<BR>   <BR>It's very funny on a very dry level, drudging through topics like existentialism, human evolution, and human interaction in depths seemingly forgotten to the superficiality of everyday television.<br />It's a good, alternative film, worth seeing for its unique visuals and worth hearing for it's erudite jabs into higher thinking. I want the DVD!
B00003CXXJ|4.0|The animation is incredible, and the DVD is filled with some interesting extras, including an engaging director's commentary, and a technical making-of documentary.
0743201140|3.0|I only bought this book to get the number off the inside jacket to take the assessment--I did not really read it much.  What I did read seemed to have a very corporate thrust which was not my preference.  Overall, this assessment has some valuable merit and I recommend it to anyone.
B0000025R3|5.0|The first album from Men at Work. Brings the great hit-singles &quot;Who Can It Be Now?&quot; and &quot;Down Under&quot;, the aussie musical anthem.<BR>Both songs were #1 in charts all around the world, as the album.<BR>Another great songs are on the list, &quot;Touching the Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Down By The Sea&quot;, &quot;Be Good Johnny&quot; and others. It's listening to remember these great songs!!!
6305841861|5.0|EDII is a wacked out horror-comedy, and definitely not for all tastes. In fact, the first time I saw it many years ago, I thought it was stupid. I was into &quot;serious&quot; horror films at the time and didn't appreciate the humor in it. It's almost a satire of the horror genre, even of the original Evil Dead. Years later I was able to appreciate it for what it is. If you approach it with this in mind, it's a scream of a good time. The original Evil Dead film was scarier, but the only humor in it was unintentional, ie: incredibly bad acting, super cheesy FX. In EDII, we get better acting and better FX, still cheesy but they fit the tone of the film. The gore is so over the top it's hilarious! What really makes the film is Sam Raimi's camera work and Bruce Campbell's crazed acting and brilliant physical comedy. The bit with the evil hand is just classic. <br />Folks who gripe about plot holes and the like: loosen up, it's just a cheesy horror movie. You're taking it way too seriously. It's really a marvelous piece of work for a relatively low budget film, and there's a reason why it's earned such a cult following and is held in such high esteem by many in the business: it's full of creativity. <br />I think it can also be argued that EDII spawned first person shooter computer games like Doom and Duke Nukem 3D. (Doom has a chainsaw for a weapon, and Duke Nukem spouts one-liners lifted  right out of EDII and &quot;Army Of Darkness&quot;..)<br />There's been a lot of controversy over the story not matching up with the first film. Here's my take on it: It's not really a sequel. Ash didn't go back to the cabin. The events at the first of EDII are a recap of what happened in the first ED film, for people who didn't see it, but EDII is meant to stand on it's own. &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; is the sequel to EDII, so there are really only two films in the 'series', not three. I think the original Evil Dead is just a 'demo' if you will, of what Raimi really had in mind. Personally, I'm glad he increased the humor and decreased the hard core gore a bit, makes it more entertaining. The last time I tried to watch the original Evil Dead, I could barely finish, it was so bad. Of the three Evil Dead films, this one is hands down my favorite.<br />The DVD of this is great, especially the commentary, one of the best I've heard. Buy it.
0688170528|5.0|The book the pact is one of the greatest books that I have ever read. <BR>Jodi Picoult is a really wonderful writer and I can't wait to read more of her books. The entire book kept me interested and there was not a time that I wanted to put the book down. <BR>Chris and Emily were great characters and I could actually put myself in their place. She described them so well that I actually felt like I was in their relationship.<BR>My favorite part of the book was the end. I loved the drama especially when gus and Michael were having feelings for eachother and they didn't have a clue what to do. <BR>The blank note in the can at the end of the book had to be the most depressing thing that i have ever read but it just made me love the book even more.<BR>In my opinion this book should be a classic and I know that it will be one of those books that i read again and again and my children will definately have to read it as soon as they learn how to read.
B00005JJX6|5.0|Besides North by Northwest, this is the second best Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock movie of all time. Can't wait to buy it on DVD!
B0000041DF|4.0|Argerich certainly leaves nothing on the table here. Even after reading numerous reviews of these performances, I was not prepared for the velocity and attack that hit me. Now, after several hearings, I feel I can record some observations of these amazing live documents.<br />First, it *is* possible to play the Rachmaninoff 3rd too fast. I never thought I would hear a performance that achieved this, but I think Argerich goes beyond even the ideal fast tempo, so that the movement (alla breve) loses character, suffering mostly in the weight of the chords and the decorative notes. My reference has been the Wild/Horenstein recording: Wild's tempi are faster than most, but his greatest achievement is in the power with which he builds to climax. This is particularly telling in the shorter cadenza (also played by Argerich), where he creates tremendous tension without resorting to stunts (i.e., playing as rapidly as possible without regard to musicality).<br />To Argerich's credit, I doubt that Wild or even Horowitz could whip through octaves and scales at such speed. So the experience is unique, even if you feel like you are sitting under the bigtop.<br />The Argerich approach works much better in the Tchaikovsky, where the naturally impetuous music caters to her flights. The scherzo in the second movement passes in a shower of sparks! For me, this recording is much more competitive than the Rachmaninoff as a legitimate realization. Van Cliburn is much more stylish and regal with the same conductor, but she makes his tempos sound pokey. The listener must decide.<br />For connoisseurs of utmost virtuosity, speedfreaks, et al., this is definitely recommended. Interesting that Bryce Morrison's liner notes call her a tigress --- the animal metaphor can be extended to her technique (superhuman or not human) and ultimately, to her lack of sympathy for the music.
0517122707|5.0|I loved this book!  The characters are outrageous and hilarious! It is one of the few books that I can quote from after reading it at least six years ago! Many of my friends loved it too. To me, it is a 'cult type' book.  You either get the humor or your don't.  I was saddened to hear that the author had committed suicide. He was quite a wit!!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The director does a wonderful job of putting the viewer in the shoes of the main character - a man who cannot create new memories.  All of the negative reviews for this movie are made by people who simply don't understand this.  Buy this movie instead of renting it to save on the huge late fee you'll have from watching it over and over to piece together this masterpiece.<BR>Bravo.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Okay, for the last time. Episode I is the first story of the saga. Therefore, it would be foolish-yes, foolish-to believe that it would be the same as the first trilogy. I constantly hear &quot;fans&quot; down the movie mostly because there were no Han Solos or Boba Fetts or Leias walking around. Duh, some of the classic characters weren't even born yet. The movie accomplished it's purpose quite well by telling us where this all started. I for one was excited to see the Jedi Counsel, young Anakin, and Princess Leia's mom. The story was intended to start things off. Some of these plot lines won't be answered until Episode 3 or are already reaveled in the latter three films.<br />All in all, I  got goosebumps when I saw Episode I in the theatre and they haven't left yet. Lucas strived for excellence and got it. The DVD features are just the icing on an already scrumptious cake. I love being able to skip to scenes like Queen Amidala's Senate Speech to anything with Darth Maul in it. If you got a DVD this should be in your collection. Do not listen to those naysayers still wearing their Darth Vader UnderRoos hoping that Carrie Fisher will visit them in her iron bra. Listen to true fans like myself who love good storytelling, great effects, and characters that will endure for a lifetime. Trust the Force on this one.
B00005NWRS|3.0|Try as I might to give Ryan a break, I can't help feeling he needs more quality control. He's like Prince in the mid-Eighties, brilliant but over-prolific, with no one brave enough to tell him that some of his tunes really aren't as good as they could/should be. I also don't like the deliberate &quot;I'm so sensitive&quot; Morrissey-like posing, or the way he namechecks US states all the time (or the whole country, on the sleeve) - it's a little manipulative for my tastes. Nevertheless, Ryan is one of the best new talents out there. I'd also recommend Eileen Rose - spectacularly good.
B00003CX8J|5.0|X-Men was the movie that made me want a DVD. The ability to watch this new classic in surround sound and crisp graphics made me drool so much that I got a player. I admit- I watch X-Men and see where something could have been added and where something should have been taking away. True fans who kept with the film now why the movie is the way it is but for those that don't the studio rushed it so good bye masterpiece, hello action junk.<br />But there are three miracles working on this movie 1)Bryan Singer, 2) the actors, 3) the story. Despite hacky editing (bad studio, BOO!!) the movie is still awesome. Bryan and his team manage to keep the magic alive through a good plot and honest acting. Fans love it because we grew up with these characters. They could do a pop album and we'd buy it-let's be honest. Non fans get an introduction to one of the most extrodinary, inventive, and original tales ever. Don't trust me? I got proof-you know a movie is good when you hear people gasp when Mystique transform or little boys yelling &quot;COOL!&quot; when Wolverine pops his claws or applause during the credits. Now that is a good movie. Now add some extras like deleted scenes, designs, a making of and you got a classic DVD. Get it now, bub.
0345448898|5.0|This trilogy is one of the most enjoyable stories I have read in a long time. Suspenseful. Scary. Complex. Sad. Interesting, multi-dimensional characters. Thought-provoking: Is organized religion inherently evil? What happens when we die? Are there other worlds out there? Does love and truth conquer all? Heavy stuff. Add to all this the fascinating journey of Lyra to meet her destiny. It's that good. I'm not exagerating.<br />I am 39 years old. I realize these books are marketed for young adults, but readers aged 12 and up will enjoy them. (My daughter who is 12 read them with me and although I had to explain a few things to her, she loved them as much as I did.)
0671867369|5.0|Another excellent work by Ambrose! He really hits home with his descriptions of the battles and training that these men went through. As in most of Ambrose's war books, one of the ever present themes is the 'American Spirit' and the role it plays in the war. He stresses how instrumental the brotherhood of these men was in their success. This brotherhood was forged very early on in the story.  All the men had to go through the same rite of passage, boot camp at Camp Toccoa. There they learned how to be soldiers, and it was there, at Toccoa, that the men forged their bonds with each other by sweating and bleeding together throughout boot camp.  That is where Ambrose's American Spirit is created within these men. And it carries throughout the story. Yet another good example of the prevalent 'American Spirit' is the scene where Winters leads an undersized group against a much larger, and better armed German brigade, and still ends up with the victory by following their training, 'fighting as one'. Their bond went beyond life and death, their bond was eternal..... All in all truly an uplifting and heartwarming theme....
6305728437|5.0|A woman can do what an army of men couldn't.  Mulan is a great film to demonstrate a woman's ability to overcome cultural stereotypye of inferiority.
0783232039|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of the Child's Play films but i really like this one. while not as scary or suspenseful or creepy as the others, this movie is still the best one. The Dolls are incredible and life like and the special effects are top notch. This also had some of the greatest one liners and some of the funniest dialogue i've heard in a horror film. One of the great things about this movie is they pay so many tributes and homages to horror movies that came before it, like Halloween, and Friday the 13th and HellRaiser and even the classic Bride of Frankenstein. If you don't believe me check out the police evidence room at the beginning VERY closely. this movie even pokes fun at itself &quot;chucky&quot;- it's a long story,if it were a movie it would  take three or four sequels to do it justice&quot;. While not up there on the horror scale, this movie is seriously entertaining.<br />Here's hoping they make another sequel just as good if not better than this one. Jennifer tilly was great in this and if you focus on the fact that the dolls carry the story and they are the main characters and everything else is just filler, you'll like this movie a lot. Just my opinion but this movie is one of my favorites.
B00004R99I|3.0|Not very true to Native American culture or the story of Pocahantas--which is true of most Disney movies.  But if you're young (under age 8) and in to music, it's cute.
B00005QGAV|5.0|The first copy of Dangerous I got was an audio cassette back when the ablum was newly released.  I didn't have a CD Player back then.  The album was so good that the tape is now full of snap, crackles, and pops from heavy use from the tape.  I decided to get the new Special Edition CD to replace my worn out cassette copy.  Hearing Dangerous newly remastered brings me back to the early 90s.

B000002RA9|5.0|I originally purchased this as a vinyl album in 1973, when I was a student at Sheffield Polytechnic. Although I have lots of other Hawkwind albums from the 70's and 80's (which I still listen to and enjoy)I never tire of Space Ritual. Hawkwind's sound, thanks to Dave Brock, is so unique that no other band comes close when it comes to space/fantasy rock.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This classic film is a Henson and Oz masterpiece.  They've never done me wrong and this one is one of their best.  This is as visually stunning and imaginative as Star Wars but always goes a step further.  The only people in this film are in costume and the majority of characters are puppets.  I love Star Wars but this film is more original.  BETTER THAN STAR WARS!!!!!
0553573403|5.0|Granted, I havent read many fantasy series..(...) After those two, I didnt beleive I would find anything worthwhile...til I was recommended to read GRR Martin. Let me say...I was wrong!!!.<br /> Now...I love my authors for diff reasons ..(...)<br />Now to me , the reason why I think Martin is superb is that ..he is the perfect blend of these two styles of writing that I have come to love. He has the gritty realism of sex, violence, cruelty, murder and mayhem of a Goodkind, with the insight into characters of Jordan. And although his focus may not be on world building (like Goodkind) he does provide enough info and detail to provide a solid background for the story..so what if we dont know the major hollidays of a particular region? Also, like Jordan, Martin is the master of political intrigue and machinations. He may not be the master weaver that Jordan is..but I love the fact that his plots have clear resolutions..you dont have to wait 5 books to see how a particular thread plays out. Unlike Jordan or Goodkind, the books in this series are very light on magic/sorcery..however, I think that adds to the story...does away with the whole Fate/Destiny ploy and makes it truly a human story...and in this world decisions and actions have real and most likely fatal consequences...its a real, cruel world in Martins books. Which is unlike the sterile safeness of Goodkind and Jordan, who are always loathe to kill off any major or central characters, who somehow always manage to prevail even while making perfect blunders. This heightened reality of Martin's adds a sense of danger..that no character, no matter how beloved is safe, if they make a stupid decision... And as for the characters...Martin is the master of perspective..He never lets your heart and loyalties fall cleanly with one camp or another. Just when you are all for one side...he shows you the heart and mind of the 'enemy' and makes you rethink your initial assesment. In this world, the good guys can wear black and the bad guys do good deeds...and no characters have unbloodied hands. So, I love the fact that instead of black and white, there are varying shades of grey for the characters..its very masterful manipuation that leaves you wondering just how will everything play out, and who exactly are you rooting for. And , the main thing about Martin..its never stale...the language is always terse, to the point and keeps the story moving. Repeat phrasing is rarely a problem( UNlike with Jordan) Once I get started on a Martin book, I usually dont stop unless for hunger or fatigue..Im never bogged down with trudging through reems and reems of descriptive prose.(unlike this review HAH HA!) I admit the going can be a bit slow at first..eps when u are dying to know what is happening with other characters...but for the most part, Im usually never outright bored with a chapter..for with Martin, you MUST pay attention to see where this point of the journey is taking you. So..to all Jordan and Goodkind fans out there..if you truly want the best of both worlds..and a story that is most definitely on the R rated side...pick up and start reading GRR Martin today, you will not be dissapointed.d the bad guys do good deeds...and no characters have unbloodied hands.

The book is the least enjoyable of the Austen collection, and the Fanny of the page is the most simpering, morally superior holier-than-thou and generally despicable of Austen's heroines.

0743420373|3.0|Overall I thought this book was pretty good in convincing Americans that anyone can be millionaires.  Danko and Stanley provided a behind-the-scenes look at the lifestyles of millionaires and the techniques of improving the way we look at money.  I thought it was a good book for teenagers to read because it gives early advice in the ways of making smart investments and building money-saving habits for a successful future.  It was a good motivator for those who often spend uneccessary amounts of money.  However, the book was also a bit too redundant.  It kept on talking about the same thing over and over again, which was pretty annoying.  I guess it was the author's way of getting the ideas in our head, which became quite bothersome at many times.
6305776326|1.0|Words cannot describe how horrible this movie is.  The writing is awful, the acting is worse, and the plot is just plain stupid!  Do not waste your time watching this movie!  I wish the SNL producers would learn their lesson by now: 10 minute skits do not translate well into 90 minute movies, especially when the skit is not funny in the first place.  Mary Katherine Gallagher is the worst character ever to stink up the silver screen, and I pray we've seen the last of her.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I bought this cd after listening to, and enjoying incubus' last cd.  I thought this cd does not have the good songs like their last cd, like drive, stellar, and pardon me.  However, it is a great compilation of their musical stylings, with the use of many instruments not used by most of the groups in their category of music.  All in all, if you like incubus' last cd, then pick up morning view, cause its worth it.

B00005NWM3|5.0|just as the title of this review says, the songs kick butt.  i cant say enough about this cd.  i didnt know what to expect, but i know now that nickelback is purely amazing.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This cd is excellent, i have been a devoted fan of Incubus since the arrival of Make Yourself in my local CD store. I was very fearful that this able would in no way be able to follow up the incredible Make Yourself, but it dug new territory and surpassed where the band took Make Yourself.<BR>    <BR>    Althought the CD doesent resemble the band we heard on S.C.I.E.N.C.E , there new sound stands apart from anything weve heard in the last year. You have a good time listening to this album and you can tell they had a good time making it!<br />    &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; gets you started and is a great intro song. &quot;Wish you Were Here&quot; keeps the CD flowing, and 2 great songs &quot;11AM&quot; and &quot;Mexico&quot; both resembling &quot;Drive&quot; get the CD to the highlight, and gem entitled &quot;Echo&quot;. I feel in love with this song on the first listen, and it definatly stands out as the best track on the album, althought its slow and has barely any DJ in it. &quot;Are you in?&quot; closes the album out and you cant wait to listen to it again. <BR>  <BR>    I would recomend this CD to anyone who is looking for a change in the traditional LIMP BIZKIT era of rock-crap...BUY IT!
0393317552|4.0|I enjoyed this book completely.  It's scope is magnificent and opened my eyes to one possible answer to the Western Europe Rules question -- the availability of domesticable food sources.<br />I liked how the author addressed the myriad aspects contained: language, food production, invention, etc.<br />Some other reviews on this site have detracted from what this book is about -- a hypothesis that is supported by the data at hand.  Most of the detractors points have low merit (and I would think these same reveiwers have spent little time trying to forage for food in the wilderness considering one persons point that &quot;ideas&quot; have more meaning).  One point that a reviewer made that I will agree with, is that luck plays a large part in how things turn out.<br />Still, the book could be repetitive, and I don't think it is the final answer to the question set forward... only a very well thought out answer.
B00005JH9W|4.0|Freaks (Tod Browning, 1932)<br /><br />While Tod Browning directed sixty-two films, from the early days of silent movies until the beginning of World War II, the vast majority of filmgoers (even of the snob variety) remember Browning solely for Freaks, his groundbreaking 1932 picture about carnival life. (Browning also directed Lugosi's Dracula and Chaney in a number of films, but the stars tended to eclipse the director in those cases.)<br /><br />The plot of the film is one of the mothers of all urban legends: a \\"normal\\" woman, Cleopatra the trapeze artist (Olga Baclanova) romances a sideshow performer, Hans the midget (Harry Earles) away from his fiancee, fellow midget Freida (Harry's real-life sister, Daisy), in order to get his inheritance so she and her real love, Hercules (Henry Victor) can run off and live like king and queen. This, needless to say, disquiets the sideshow pooulace, who get revenge on Cleopatra in a rather unique way. The plot is also, as should be obvious, quite thin and silly. The acting, in many cases, is atrocious, aside from a few Hollywood veterans, notably Henry Victor and Roscoe Ates, both of whom were quite well-known in their day (Victor was the lead in the 1916 production of The Picture of Dorian Gray; Ates was a character actor with a resume that encompassed such films as Gone with the Wind, The Champ, King Kong, and the 1933 live-action version of Alice in Wonderland). In other words, if you're looking for your basic Hollywood blockbuster, you're going to be disappointed.<br /><br />What makes Freaks (based on Clarence Robbins' novel _Spurs_) a classic is that Browning cast actual sideshow performers in many roles, and then handed them a script that treated them as human beings rather than freaks; the beauty of the movie's title is in its irony (something missed by many over the years who would have had the film banned). Browning's movie should have ushered in a new era of tolerance and recognition that so-called accidents of birth are human, too; unfortunately, more recent exploitation flicks like _Freaks Uncensored!_ (1999) and the ever-popular Mondo Cane series (made between 1962 and 1988) provide pretty solid evidence that such is not the case. (It is another sad irony that the cast list for Freaks Uncensored! contains many of the same names as does Browning's film.) Still, Browning is certainly to be commended for trying, at least, and his amusing little peccadillo is certainly worth going out of your way to watch a time or two. **** 1/2tunately, more recent exploitation flicks like _Freaks Uncensored!_ (1999) and the ever-popular Mondo Cane series (made between 1962 and 1988) provide pretty solid evidence that such is not the case.

B00005JKOV|4.0|With &quot;Waking Life,&quot; Richard Linklater returns to the loose, freewheeling structure he employed in his first film, &quot;Slacker.&quot; The two main departures in &quot;Waking Life&quot; are 1) he animates the movie by filming live actors and superimposing computer images, and b) he anchors &quot;Waking Life&quot; by employing an unnamed protagonist played by &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; actor Wiley Wiggins. The animated version of Wiggins wanders through his waking and dreaming life--the line between the two growing ever thinner--as various friends and acquaintances tell him their philosophies of life. (Among them are Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy sitting up in bed, discussing reincarnation and the afterlife; &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; fans will be delighted to know that Celine and Jesse reunited after all!) At first I thought this was a film I wouldn't particularly want to see again, but I find certain images and lines from it haunting me.  Some speakers in &quot;Waking Life&quot; are more interesting than others, but the animation by more than 30 artists gives the film a kaleidoscopic, Chagall- meets-Peter Max quality that holds the interest, and Wiggins is an engaging screen presence even as a cartoon! &quot;Waking Life&quot; is a film that gives us substantial food for thought and gracefully insinuates itself into our minds.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|First off let me say, that I think Shrek is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  The thing that really sets this DVD apart from others that I own are all the wonderful extra's.  It contains the movies in wide screen and pan and scan, commentary from some of the makers.  Many games, music numbers.  It even lets you dub yourown voice into certain scenes from the movie in place of the actor.  I have never had so much fun, and I'm still finding more things to do.
B00003CX8J|4.0|This is a great movie!  I have loved the X-Men since I was little, and this is a great movie.  My only hope is that they follow through and come out with a Weapon X sequel!
B00005OWIU|5.0|John WIlliam's smile-inducing nineteen track soundtrack for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is brilliant in it's execution.  From the rousing &quot;Quidditch Match&quot; and the melodious &quot;Fluffy's Harp&quot; the album is magnificent in it's ability to play with listeners emotions.  Williams' incredible knack for deriving suspense out of the simplist tones (seen in Jurassic Park and others) drives the tracks of this perfectly exciting score.  And if this is any sort of precursor to the film, we are all in for quite a treat.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek is truly a wonderful movie, in all aspects. The animation is excellent, the dts surround is awesome! The dvd features 2 discs, one with full screen, and the 2nd with widescreen format, but there is tons of extras on both discs, worth checking them out for sure! Young and old will enjoy this for sure!
B00003CXRP|5.0|I loved this movie I even like it better than Forrest Gump its by far Tom Hanks best movie to date. His performance is one of the best I have ever seen. This movie should be in every body's DVD collection just for the movie and thats not even including all the goodies on the DVD. One word sums up this movie brillent.
B0000033TE|5.0|This album is everything people really love or hate about prog rock. Those who hate prog rock uses this album or Tarkus (or Yes' Tales From Topographic Oceans) as the pet whipping boy, accusing the genre of being overindulgent, pretentious, and overly-interested in being technical. But whatever the case, as being a diehard prog rock fan, this album holds special to me, because it was one of the earliest prog rock albums I got in to that wasn't in my parents collection. I bought this in 1991 when I was 18 years old, because I realized the likes of New Kids on the Block just wouldn't do for me. The album opens with &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, an old English tune using Willam Blake's poem, in a prog rock fashion. &quot;Toccata&quot; is one of ELP's more experimental pieces, based on some composer from Argentina which I can't remember his name at the moment. &quot;Still... You Turn Me On&quot; is another Greg Lake ballad in the tradition of &quot;Lucky Man&quot; and &quot;From the Beginning&quot;. &quot;Benny the Bouncer&quot; is the one people seem to hate the most, much like &quot;The Sheriff&quot; from Trilogy and &quot;Jeremy Bender&quot; from Tarkus, but I actully like &quot;Benny the Boucer&quot; because of the humorous element. The rest of the album is consumed by a three movement suite, &quot;Karn Evil 9&quot;. It was &quot;First Impression Part 2&quot; that gets played most on the radio, for any of you non-progheads out there, it's the song that goes, &quot;Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends...&quot;. &quot;Second Impression&quot; is mostly a Keith Emerson piece showing off his piano talents, while &quot;Third Impression&quot; is another group composition with tons of solos of the kind that non-prog rock fans feels most uncomfortable with. The album cover was done by H.R. Giger, the same guy who did the artwork to the 1979 movie Alien, as well as a couple of other album covers, Island's Pictures (Island being a Swiss prog band from 1977 somewhere inthe Van der Graaf Generator and Gentle Giant vein), and if I remember right, a solo effort from Brainticket guy Joel Vandroogenbroeck called Biomechanoid. I happen to own an old vinyl copy of Brain Salad Surgery, which features a gimmick fold out over that reveals what the skull really is. This is a concept album about the repression of Mankind through the abuse of technology, only to find out who was behind the abuse was none other than a computer. The album is regarded as one of their greatest, and it's real easy to see why. Don't ever listen to this album, then listen to Black Moon or In the Hot Seat, you'll get depressed.
B00003W8NM|5.0|David Fincher's Fight Club is a very well made movie it pushes the limits in every way and the ending is just out of this world. Its hard to watch the last scene of the movie do to what happend in New York on Sep 11. But its still a great movie the DVD is one of the best DVD made so far. The violence is extremely bad and the film is for adults only.
B000001ELR|5.0|Kiss has released alot of good no-nonsense heavy metal. And CREATURES OF THE NIGHT is easily one of the best examples of this.<br />It isn't as 'ambitious' as DESTROYER, the best album the band ever put out. But CREATURES isn't saddled with the strings, orchestral effects, etc. found on its illustrious predecessor.<br />Topping DESTROYER is a difficult task, but CREATURES is the closest the band ever came to doing it. Every song is a killer. Particularly SAINT &amp; SINNER, which shows that you don't have to pile on guitar solos to make a driving heavy metal standard. I LOVE IT LOUD and WAR MACHINE joined such classics as DETROIT ROCK CITY and ROCK &amp; ROLL ALL NITE in their concert repertoire.<br />It's a pity this album was released during Kiss's lowest ebb. The band had tried its hand at disco with DYNASTY, and were recovering from the aftershock of THE ELDER, an under-rated but ill-timed and inappropriate venture. So CREATURES never got the appreciation it deserved. If it was released when they were still the biggest band in the world, CREATURES probably would have been put in a time capsule for future generations to enjoy. As it is, the album is a gem. Even Ace Frehley, who had left the band before the album came out, said it was the best Kiss album bar DESTROYER - and he hardly played on it. What more praise do you need? BUY IT!
0446364495|3.0|This book, in my mind, showed a love dreamed of by most, but attianed by few.  Is it not fitting that this book became such a hit in a time such as this. We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life; we've added years to life, not life to years. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor.  In a time such as this, a book comes along with a dishonest house wife, and people still marvel in this wonderful story of hideous morals. One can only ask why did this book stay on or near the top of the best sellers list for 3 years like it did? I'm curious what you think, please respond and write a review of your own.  I think this has to do with it now being socially accepted for wives and husband to not respect the vows of marriage, if. if. if it is true love they have found.
078322687X|4.0|The movie itself was enjoyable, but it makes a false reality to chlidern and adults alike that all high schools have cliche's like that and not all high schools do. And by making younger students think this they feel that they have to alter themselves to fit into the &quot;popular&quot; group. Well I'd just like to say that I really did enjoy the movie, but not all high schools are like that, mine isn't even close!
B0000009OU|5.0|Costello's second album continues in the same vein as his debut, angry tales of love, lust, and sheer pent up frustration. Dominated by Steve Nieve's organ, this CD is more polished than Costello's debut, but it feels a little over produced compared to the stripped down sound of his first release. Despite this, the songs still create a sense of tension rarely found in anyone's music. &quot;Radio, Radio&quot; may be one of the greatest songs ever about the idea of &quot;popular music&quot; and its effect on us all and the double play of &quot;The Beat&quot; and &quot;Pump It Up&quot; sums up teen years pretty well. Costello is a truly original talent and this CD shows him during the early years, still coming to grips with many of the same ideas and fears that faced his listeners. (This review is of the original American recording, not the extra track release)
0930289234|5.0|I know that sounds like a bit much but this is truly an tale with a Shakespear like eye for story structure and poetic language (I'm not saying Alan Moore is the next Shakespear, just that he's a fantastic writer). All of the characters are extremely well done and none of them perfect. On an alternate Earth, the cold war is starting to cuase more panic and things get more serious. Meanwhile a mean spirited government agent the Comedian, is murdered under mysterious circumstances. Only the psychotic detective known as Rorshach. But will any of the retired heroes be able to help Rorshach? Do they want to? The ending to this one is a bonefide shocker.<br />All of the characters are engaging. The retired Nite Owl, who's let himself go since he gave up fighting crime, both physically and mentally. The God-like Dr. Manhattan, whose power is seemingly limitless except his inability to change foreseen events. The beautiful Silk Spectre, who learns something horrible about the Comedian which she must come to terms with. The Comedian, the a living joke satire on everything wrong with America. Rorshach, the mentally unstable detective. Adrian Veldt, a genius who used his vast intelligence to become very wealthy and leads a life of decedance.<br />The world of the Watchmen is well put together. Dr. Manhattan was used to win WWII. Nixon is still president. Vigiantism is outlawed and many heroes are now working for the government.<br />The book is beautifully and poetically drawn by Dave Gibbons and the book is extremely well done. I have nothing more to say about this book without giving away surprises so I'll just tell you it's very very good.

MEXICO is a really good song but I think they are starting to overplay WISH YOU WERE HERE...I don't really mind cuz I still love the song but it kind of stinks because all these teenie boppers are coming into school knowing the songs, and me being a fan from the start sort of hates that because it is sort of like \\"my group\\" in my school...but whatever. The Album is great and JUST A PHASE is a REEEEEAAALLLLYYY good song, i love it... alright...bye!!!! (...)
B00005NWM3|3.0|No doubt, being a really great song, How You Remind Me has made many sick due to an enormous love of radiostations to the catchiest tune from Silver Side Up. A good try for the guys releasing their second album.<br />However, what else do we have on the cd? The whole bunch of nine songs that are strangely monotonous, all impress with a similarly depressing lyrics and not so varied melodies. That's a style of the band, clearly, but could there have been at least one track as much memorable and strong as How You Remind Me? There perhaps could, but never is, and it may upset some of not so big fans of the band.<br />Too Bad is good, may even easily remind you of Creed. Hollywood, Money Bought, Where Do I Hide, and Never Again are of equal quality faster and heavier tracks, and there's a good chance you would like any of them. As well as the rest of the not so many songs of the album.<br />The Nickelback's music falls into the genre of 3 Doors Down, Creed, Fuel and other similar bands, but what make them differ from the bands is a lack of diversity and not enough hits.<br />You may love them anyway. So many do already.

Chuck Palahniuk is one of the best writers of the last 20 years. Fight Club, before Survivor and Choke was the start of it all. Fight Club, has it all. Wit, Humor, action, violence, sex, drama, mind games and a great character base. Tyler, Narrator, Marla are incredible characters and stand out from every character I've ever read. You must not miss out on this amazing piece of work. It's superb. What? I said it's superb.
B00005OM5L|5.0|musicians are the same of 'from the cradle album' exept for the drummer, here appears Steve Gadd, great in this performace.<BR>Eric is great, playing at his best level. I think he's his best exibition, with lots of guitar, from acoustic to blues and rock titles. He plays old songs like 'I shot the sheriff' and 'have you ever loved a woman' and new blues songs. He plays fender as usual but also two Gibson and one acoustic for 'Layla'. The audio is very good (DTS) and the effect is great.

I enjoy the fact that these are not books I get tired of reading three and four times a night.<br />Boynton books are wonderful and this one is a lot of fun. My son likes to take this one to bed with him and look at the pictures of the animals in pajamas. Very cute.

It really shows how live rock should be played: loud, raw, powerfulr, energetic. The Who sim`ply puts on a terrific show.<BR>And now this famous in released in its complete form in this magnificent double cd deluxe edition. Nice packaging and liner notes....and great performance!!!
B00003CXXI|5.0|What an amazing movie experience. How could anyone not like Shrek is beyond me. The most entertaining, hilarious, and magical movie to come around in years. Filled with eye popping animation and heartfelt performances from the entire cast Shrek is probably the best film of the year. The animation is so good I forgot I was watching and animated film. Mike Myers as Shrek is so likebale and I don't think there has ever been a better hero.Cameron Diaz is feisty, fun, and yes even sexy as Princess Fiona. However Eddie Murphy steals the show with a hysterical performance as Donkey. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard. Probably Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin.<br />Shrek is a masterpiece and hopefully will not be ignored at this years Oscars. It should at least get a nomination.
B0000019PA|4.0|Other reviews of this album failed to capture the sheer strangeness of its sound. The vocals on this album are almost embarassingly sincere- it's that style of singing that hovers on the ragged edge of turning to a sob. The microphones are very close, creating a feeling of intimacy and confession that can let listening to &quot;In the Aeroplane...&quot; be quite an emotional experience, should you so desire. On the downside, it's not as good as a soundtrack for washing the dishes (although perhaps that's just me). The instrumentals are ragged in a way that is charming at first, but after repeated listening they begin to feel a bit expendable- the arrangements feel haphazard and the wobbling intonation might remind some of a junior high band. Also, it's a shortish album, although the tracks cohere nicely...I don't think that's grounds for calling it a 'rock opera' as one reviewer suggested. The lyrics aren't meaningful except as Rorschach blots, though, so I guess it could be a rock opera if you really wanted it to be. On the whole, quite a good album in its own clunky, homespun way.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Roberto Benigni was audacious to even consider portraying the experience of a Jewish family during the Holocaust as a subject for comedy, but he has succeeded masterfully.  I can well understand the reservations that many bring to this film.  It is important to note, however, that Benigni's comedy never makes light of the Holocaust itself; rather, it is the means by which the resourceful Guido (Benigni) attempts to salvage his son's innocence.  Guido is a heroic character, using the only tools at his command in a desperate situation.  When the child is not present, the film does allow us a few darker glimpses at the horror of the camps although these are admittedly few.  <br />I believe that humor, being one of the most delightful inventions of human creativity, can be an appropriate response to the darkness that also exists in the human soul.  The comedy of &quot;Life Is Beautiful&quot; exhalts the human spirit without doing so at the expense of the Holocaust's victims.
0670824399|5.0|What a wonderfully funny story! Matilda is a little girl we all might like to be friends with, and the social commentary is great. Like all of Dahl's stories, this book has dark undertones, but it is a story of the triumph of justice. It is great for reading aloud (I used to be able to recite the first chapter from memory). Yay for Matilda!
0783225849|5.0|If all you remember from  \\"Psycho\\" is the infamous shower scene, you owe it to yourself to revisit this grandaddy of all slasher films. Pay attention to the stifled relationship between Marion Crane and her boyfriend Sam, whom she cannot marry because he is deep in debt. This frustration, coupled with a desire for change, prompts her to steal 40 grand from her job and to flee town. She ends up at the Bates Motel, where she meets up with Norman Bates. Pay close attention to the conversation between Marion and Bates; it sets the tone for the rest of the movie, and it's the scene where Marion is finally convinced that this Norman dude is a total nutjob. At some point, Marion's conscience gets to her, and she plans to return the money, but Norman's mother has other ideas for her. This movie is a timeless classic, and also serves a huge influence to directors like Brian De Palma, who, essentially, owes his entire career to this movie and the work of Hitchcock. A great and dark follow-up to the Master's prior film, \\"North by Northwest,\\" and should not be missed. If you've already seen it, then by all means run (not walk) to the store and grab this DVD.
B000001FS3|4.0|A good solid album by one of the most talented bands of our era. I give it a B-plus because although the entire album is very good, nothing stands out as ingenious. If you're my age, though, it may give you flashbacks to fourth grade.
B00005NWM3|3.0|You might have bought this cd thinking, hey these guys aren't too bad, and you'd be right.  Until you hear there first album.  Silver Side Up seems to be the same riffs, the same chords, and the same mood rehashed throughout the whole album.  Their first album The State was much more original, and much more unique.  I was dissapointed by this release even though I am a big nickelback fan.  But if you do like this one, be sure to check our The State.
B00000DFSK|5.0|I love this compilation. Much of the time, &quot;best of&quot; albums tend not to include what is really best, and true lovers of a single artist would be better off getting all the albums. I don't have all of U2's albums, but this compilation convinced me to listen to a lot more of U2 than just &quot;The Joshua Tree.&quot; I discovered &quot;October&quot; and &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and &quot;War,&quot; among other wonderful U2 products. I bought the album that also had all the B-sides, which were delicious. If you're a die-hard fan, &quot;Best of&quot; might not be for you, but it's great for anyone else.
B00005QG9J|4.0|This is an interesting album to review. Does one see this album as a sellout to the masses or a maturity of sorts. Tough to tell, but i'd say a little of both. Incubus is one of those rare bands that changed what mainstream was, not changed for the mainstream. SCIENCE, along with ENJOY INCUBUS were amazing albums that never got their due when they were released, but the band was well known with heavy circles. The one thing that differentiated Incubus from the new school korn proteges was the fact that Boyd could sing (see A Certain Shade of Green). MAKE YOURSELF was an obvious progression in sound and melody, dropping the extremes of their sound while tightning up their melodic structure. The classic thing about that album is that Incubus still kept the quirkiness of thier debut, they just made it more accessible. Stellar and Drive blew up soon after that, but even when i first heard the album i though they were the among the best tracks on the album. Its hard to call a band selling out by writing good songs that get popular. MORNING VIEW is obviously commercially influenced, but at the same time keeps just a hair outside of mainstream rock, where no one is going to convince Incubus with the Foo Fighters anytime soon. I think its another example of Incubus makeing the mainstream adapt to them. MORNING VIEW is in my opinion weaker than the previous two cds, but then again, tracks like Are You In and Nice to Know You still display an undeniable charm while still having that Incubus flavor I have come to love
6304411448|5.0|This is a wonderful movie which will delight all movie lovers. I have NEVER met anyone who doesn't love this movie. Rent it then buy it.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|What a waste for such a great movie to have no extras.  Also... the lack of chapters is understandable, but at the same time unreasonable.  It more irks the viewer than makes him want to watch the entire film over and over.  People like viewing certain parts of their favorite movies!  That's why they made the DVD format!!!
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is one of the best anime films I have ever seen. I went out and baught it the day after I first watched it. A wonderful story, great charactors and a truely beautiful message combined with marvelous animation and design make for a film not just for fans of the genre.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I went in to this movie thinking it would be one of the stereotypical action movies with solely gore and violence to entertain me and a meaningless plot, so that I wouldn't be confused in the midst of the fighting. Well, I was quite disappointed at first. The name \\"Fight Club\\" of course was misleading..<br />I think this movie should be an example for those learning to be directors, as it's almost perfect, and maybe if someone got an idea as to how to make a movie we would see more thriller-thoughtprovoking movies.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|The movie was beyond amazing, the music was fantastic, so why wasnt the soundtrack?<br />First of all, they cut out songs. The absolutely fantastic &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, the okay, but funny &quot;It Will Run For 50 Years&quot; song,the really good &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; song, and the amazing song at the begonning when theyre all dancing and singing &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. They included the Mya and Pick etc version of Lady Marmalade, but I think pretty much everyones fed up of that.<br />The CD also has a terrible, terrible TERRIBLE verion of &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot; and some wierd French song. Becks &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; is okay.<br />The CD has all the great Ewan Mcgregor and Nicole Kidmans songs, and the fantastic &quot;Roxanne&quot;, but the CD just doesnt feel like anything to do with the movie.<br />Only buy this if you dont want to download them off the net.
B00003CXS4|4.0|I loved Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (Guy Ritchie's previous film) and Snatch lived up to my expectations.  The amazing plot, which ties together the stories of many different people, keeps your interest throughout.  There is some profanity and violence, so it's best not watched by young kids.  Overall I liked Lock, Stock more than Snatch, but both are _excellent_ movies, and both are in my small DVD collection.
0345347951|5.0|I was strictly a dabbler in science fiction, until this book grabbed me and pulled me in.  To this day, it ranks as my favourite in the genre.<BR>The Overlords appear one day over every city on Earth, and with little resistance, mankind submits to the technologically superior race.  After all, their demands are entirely benevolent; they seem to want no more than to end war, poverty, and the other evils that have always plagued the Earth.  But why?  Through three generations, a few people endeavour to find out.<BR>What they finally learn is something they never imagined: mankind's terrible and wonderful final destiny, and the part the mysterious Overlords are fated to play in achieving it.<BR>Many of Clarke's novels are somewhat lacking in character development, and though Childhood's End is not an extreme example of this tendency, some fairly important characters are only half-formed.  In some books, this is a flaw, but when Clarke is truly in his element, the vagueness of the characters seems to work in the story's favour.  Here, particularly, I found myself getting quite attached to characters it seemed I barely knew (including some of the enigmatic aliens).<BR>One feature I particularly liked in this book was the glimpse of the Overlords' home world, a tour of wonders that Clarke knows better than to try and explain in terms of known science, at least not with any detail.  If anything, the mystery of it all makes the story-- and the Overlords-- seem more real.<BR>The ending, though inspiring from a certain angle, can be a downer in terms of the characters you come to know and like, no matter where your sympthies end up lying.  Mine, in the end, fall with Karellen, the Overlord supervisor, who, like the other Overlord characters, manages to be thoroughly believable despite the fact that his background and motivations remain more or less a mystery.<BR>Science fiction is often infused with philosophy; this book pulls off the mixture better than any other I've read.
B00000ICN5|5.0|When this album came out in 1983, the music world was trapped in a morass of synth-pop drivel.  This album provided a sonic battering ram, re-opening a door that had been shut for too long.<br />I was absolutely bowled over when this album first came out and it still gets me every time I listen to the CD.<br />His Hendrix/Guy/King(Albert) influences are hard to miss, but he melded their styles into his own.  From the opening romp of Lovestruck Baby to his final (not countin the bonus tracks) instrumental ode to his then-wife Lenny, there is not a misstep on this CD.<br />He may have gone on to write and perform stronger material, but for reminding everyone about the blues, this CD gets 5 stars.
B000001EGA|5.0|&quot;Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; finds Elton John at the apex of his then six year solo career at the time (remember, he got his start as a member of an r &amp; b group known as Bluesology in the sixties, along with co-members Long John Baldry and Elton Dean, from where the previously known Reg Dwight found his stage name - Elton John [the one and only, of course!]). Although &quot;Captain Fantastic...&quot; is not as dominant musically as EJ's previous albums, there are still some marvelous hidden gems, nonetheless, such as the glam rockers &quot;Bitter Fingers&quot; and the CD's title track. The selections featured on the first half and on the beginning of the second half of &quot;Captain Fantastic...&quot;, in the lyrics dept., as well as the music itself, contain many positive, fluent vibes, which will leave one in an adventurous state of mind, to say the least. As for the last four songs (&quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, &quot;Writing&quot;, &quot;We All Fall In Love Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Curtains&quot;), it seems as if EJ's and Bernie Taupin's ideas were beginning to lose steam (especially in the latter three above compositions), and, as a result, it appears these two hitmeisters were bored by the whole music scene. What is also surprising, is that the mega-hits &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; are displayed here....as bonus tracks?! I thought these were part of the original album! The disc's lone track, &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot;, is insightful and desperately thought-provoking, and contains a cute semibiographical reference - &quot;sugar bear&quot;. I also found it interesting that the record company erred in forgetting to include &quot;Dogs In The Kitchen&quot; on this disc, as the lyrics included in the CD booklet look interesting enough. Even though Elton, Davey Johnstone, Nigel Olsson, Dee Murray &amp; Co. weren't quite as original or inventive in their playing on this disc as in previous outings, &quot;Captain Fantastic...&quot; still gets high marks for its unique scope and creativeness, and that says a lot about these talented musicians. A few months later, Elton would release his next record - &quot;Rock Of The Westies&quot;, in the autumn of '75. That particular record proved to be somewhat weaker than &quot;Capt. Fantastic...&quot; - the reason being that both Nigel Olsson and Dee Murray were fired by Elton earlier in '75 after the release of &quot;Capt. Fantastic...&quot;, and were replaced by original Elton John Band member Roger Pope on drums, as well as a new bassist, Kenny Passerelli, who previously performed in Joe Walsh's group, among others. Both Olsson and Murray were sorely missed by fans, and brought a unique style and brand of creativity to the Elton John Band during this period, although I believe both were rehired later in Elton's career. &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; is fantastic at that, and should not be missed by any Elton John fan, whether they be a diehard or casual fan.sc as in previous outings, &quot;Captain Fantastic...&quot; still gets high marks for its unique scope and creativeness, and that says a lot about these talented musicians.

B00003CY0V|2.0|There are exactly two entertaining scenes in this godawful action flick. The first is the Matrix-style \\"money shot\\" of a terrorist hostage exploding in slow motion. It is a truly spectacular shot - morally bankrupt, of course, but in the finest tradition of the genre. It lasts for around ten seconds, I guess.<br />The second is the widely heralded baring of Halle Berry's breasts. This lasts for only two seconds but the DVD will allow the interested viewer to freeze the image indefinitely without loss of picture quality. Accusations of cynicism on the producers' parts aside, this is definitely the more intriguing of the two scenes.<br />When Meryl Streep flashed a nipple in \\"Silkwood\\", it was slightly shocking but it actually developed the character and no one felt the great actor's dignity was impaired. Everyone who saw \\"Swordfish\\" in the theaters knew that Ms. Berry's moment-of-truth was coming. For two seconds she displayed the merchandise and then the movie stumbled along with \\"electrifying\\" scenes of Hugh Jackman typing really fast and so on.
1565114965|4.0|The best way to read this novel is with a book of Vermeer's artwork by your side! I enjoyed thumbing through it and looking at his paintings while simultaneously reading &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring.&quot;<br /> This is the most fun I have had with historical fiction, and because not much is known about Vermeer, I appreciated Tracy Chevalier's efforts. I especially loved the descriptions of Griet making the paint for Vermeer, the scenes in the streets of Delft, family life in the 1600's, and the creative process of Vermeer. <br />This is a great gift for Vermeer fans or historical fiction readers.
B00005R23S|5.0|Bruce Springsteen reteamed with the E Street Band for their first tour in ten years in early 1999.  The tour took them around the world and eventually ended up in Madison Square Garden in New York City for a series of shows in June &amp; July of 2000.  The last two shows where filmed and presented as a television special on HBO in early 2001.  The show perfectly captured the raw intensity and energy of the shows.  During the tour, Mr. Springsteen talked about how he and the band were rededicated to the power and ministry of rock and roll.  Mr. Springsteen plays the part of the preacher and his songs provide the sermons.  The DVD adds eleven more songs to the original fifteen from the broadcast and they give an even greater sense of the overall show.  There are some nice extras like a featurette on the shows and an interview Mr. Springsteen did with Bob Costas.  But the real reason to buy the disk is the performance itself and even as he's reached his 50's, Mr. Springsteen brings a youthful exuberance to his shows and he lets it all hang out.

B0000025T6|5.0|Bruce Springsteen writes about America; her hopes and fears and the hopes and fears, the lives of the people who live within her. And nowhere has he--or anyone else--done that as well as with Nebraska.<br />Each song on Nebraska is a masterpiece that anyone would be proud of writing. They are stories of murder, love, loss, sadness and--ultimately--redemption, and they are nothing like the next album he put out, Born In The USA. Well, not entirely, anyway--two tracks from BITUSA. &quot;I'm On Fire&quot; and &quot;Downbound Train&quot; were apparently written to be included in Nebraska. If you've heard that album, then you have some idea of what Nebraska is about.<br />It's just Bruce, a guitar and a harmonica--and in the end, that's all you need. I give this album my highest recommendation.
0441172717|5.0|Few books can compare to The Lord of the Rings, but I believe Frank Herbert has produced one such story. Set on the desert planet of Arrakis, or Dune, the book follows a man destined to become the savior of Dune's desert dwelling Fremen. Herbert brings this tale to life with memorable characters, brilliant detail and an intruiging plot that will keep the reader interested from cover to cover. A book no science fiction library should be without.
B00003CXB2|5.0|\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is universally acknowledged as one of the greatest biographies in film history - a brilliantly nuanced and insightful portrait of one of the 20th century's most compelling and enigmatic figures. However, as a recent viewing reminded me, it is also one of the greatest war films. The assault on Aqaba, for example, is staged with a narrative clarity and visceral impact that must have been an inspiration to Michael Mann when choreographing the instantly-classic bank robbery gunfight in \\"Heat\\". Of course, it is also one of the great spectacle films - providing sights as epic and stirring as any found in \\"Lord of the Rings\\", with the added impact of being absolutely real and (with sad certainty) of a kind never to be seen again. Yet amazingly, it is also one of the greatest love stories.  Since it is notoriously a film with no women in speaking roles, a word of explanation is in order.    My wife, despite having otherwise fine taste in films, has always had what I can only assume is a gender-based blind spot for this one. \\"A boy movie,\\" she shrugs dismissively. And in fairness, the film does celebrate the virtues of courage and fortitude from a purely masculine point of view. [Though these virtues are hardly  unique to men - as any woman who has given childbirth can tell you.] But what the missus misses is the genuinely romantic aspect of hero worship. In a now-legendary intro shot as swoon-worthy as anything in \\"Dr. Zhivago\\", Sherif Ali rides out of the sun to have his bloody \\"meet cute\\" with Lawrence at the drinking well where they verbally spar like Beatrice and Benedick. Later, Ali throws a fussy sulk at Lawrence's \\"impossibleness\\" that is worthy of Bette Davis. But when Lawrence heroically brings Gasim out of the Nefud, Ali can finally give up his proud heart. He becomes a desert wife of sorts - upgrading Lawrence's wardrobe, nagging him to eat properly, tending to his wounds. As the character who best understands his greatness, it is Ali who must suffer the deepest heartbreak over Lawrence's losing struggle against the nihilism of the desert and the futility of human endeavor. [Just one quote, to illustrate the start-to-finish brilliance of Robert Bolt's and Michael Wilson's dialogue: \\"If I fear him, who love him, how must he fear himself, who hates himself?\\"] Their final parting - set to the silent music of a dream too beautiful to last -  is as sad and poignant as anything in chick flicks like \\"Brief Encounter\\" or \\"The Way We Were\\". And if you're too homophobic to appreciate this for what it is - a love story - so much the sadder for you.    That losing struggle is what makes \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" - in addition to all its other splendors - also one of the greatest philosophical dramas. Lawrence is a tragic hero in the mold of (and of comparable stature to) the greatest of them all - Hamlet. Like his Danish predecessor, Lawrence is forced to articulate his greatness in a world of politics and treachery that is unworthy of him - leaving him torn between contemplation and action - the conflict impulsively expressing itself as clownish displays of foppish eloquence. Like the Prince, Lawrence finds no triumph in the achievement of his quest - only the laying bare of an all-too-human bloodthirstiness that spells the doom of all his (and our?) nobler hopes. As he struggles against giving the order for a My Lai-esque massacre of an unarmed Turkish convoy, Lawrence's face [animated by the incomparable acting of Peter O'Toole] all but says: \\"Now could I drink hot blood! and do such bitter business, as the day would quake to look on...\\"    As you can probably tell by now, this film is an epic in many ways other than running time and number of extras. If you have never seen it projected in 70mm on a Ziegfeld-sized screen, you will only experience its greatness in translation. However, experience it you should. And once you do, people will be able to say of you - as is said of Lawrence at the end - \\"There is only thedesert for you now.\\"
B00001PE4D|1.0|I found it difficult to sit through this film. The performances (apart from Reese Witherspoon) were uniformly abysmal. Sarah Michelle Gellar's dull performance was distinguishable from her Buffy character only by some cleavage and some colorful language. Ryan Phillippe was an irritating, whining child. <br />I don't normally object to movies on the grounds that they set bad examples for children, but when a movie this bad cynically attempts to exploit teen hormones in order to make a few bucks, I find it very depressing.
B000008GEF|3.0|Living In The Material World is a solid follow up to George Harrison's All Things Must Pass.  Mr. Harrison was easily the most spiritual Beatle and he's never been afraid of preaching his beliefs.  Songs like &quot;The Light That Has Lighted The World&quot;, &quot;The Lord Loves The One (Who Loves The Lord)&quot;, &quot;Who Can See It&quot; and the number one hit &quot;Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)&quot; all expound on Mr. Harrison's spiritual beliefs.  Despite all the love, Mr. Harrison can wield a sharp pen and that always when he's been most interesting.  On songs like &quot;Sue Me, Sue You Blues&quot;, the title track and &quot;Try Some, Buy Some&quot; he looks at the Beatles' on going lawsuits, the commercialism of the day and other things with a harder edge that he peace and love songs.  The album was a big hit, going all the way to number one, the last time he would reach the summit on the album charts.
6302453356|5.0|Steven Spielberg's Hook is a wondrous film full of great color and fantastic visuals. It's the kind of warm and fuzzy movie to be enjoyed time and again. Robin Williams stars as a grown up Peter Pan(now named Peter Panning), who doesn't remember who he really is. While on a trip to Old Wendy's place, his two children are kidnapped by Captain Hook. With the help of Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell, Peter has to go to Never Never Land to save his kids, battle Captain Hook, and realize that he is the one and only Peter Pan. The costumes are great, the sets are awe inducing, and the actors are all game. People, I ask you, who is better at playing at a person who refuses to grow up than Robin Williams?. I don't think the part could of been better cast. Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook is an image to behold. It's a classic Hoffman performance. Keep an eye out for cameos by Phil Collins, Glenn Close, and a very young Gwynneth Paltrow. This movie should entertain kids and adults alike. Kids will cherish their youth, while adults will most definitley be transported back to a magical time to think about their own youth. This is a whimsical fairy tale that's a delight from the first to last frame. I can't believe why so many people have a deep disliking of this movie. Oh well. Their loss. Kudos to Spielberg for delivering a modern day fairy tale for viewers to cherish for years to come. I'm hooked!. Sorry.
B00005J73X|5.0|This is a must have for Bon Jovi fans and rock fans in general. I liked it soooo much that I bought several for birthday presents including one for my 10 year old nephew!
B00005JCAA|2.0|This risible movie falls just short of being a legendary disaster. Barring it from greatness are its ultra-glossy production values, the always wonderful Anthony Hopkins, and the undeniable charisma of Brad Pitt who (though it kills me to say it) survives even such dignity-threatening scenes as the hospital visit to the Jamaican woman in respectable shape.<br />That said, this is still the most excruciatingly protracted screen death since &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;. I trust that the enormous financial failure of this movie will guarantee that Martin Brest is never allowed final cut again.
B00000IMCW|5.0|(...)I would like to point out that Dawn of the Dead was shot in the 1.66 ratio. It was masked,meaning the top and bottom of the film were covered, to give it a 1.85 ratio for theatrical release.  The masking was removed  for this transfer, so you are seeing the whole film frame. You are getting more information than if you saw it in the theater. It was not cropped from 1.85 to 1.66. You can look look this up at the Internet Movie Database-you can check the technical specs of this or any other movie.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence Of Arabia is one of the biggest and grandest films ever made.  Director David Lean crafted a stunning epic that tells the tale of World War I British soldier T.E. Lawrence.  Lawrence joined the various desert tribes of Arabia against the Turks and the desert battle scenes are breathtaking.  Peter O'Toole is amazing as Lawrence in what would be a star-making turn for him.  Omar Shariff, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guinness provide strong support, but this is Mr. Lean's film through and through.  His direction provides sweeping shots of the desert vistas and gives the film its big look, but he also allows the story to flow and we really get inside the complicated head of Lawrence and see his psychological foibles.  The film is beautifully transferred to DVD and it brings justice to the film that had previously suffered on video transfers.  The movie was a major success as it swept through the 1962 Oscars winning Best Picture and Best Director, but Mr. O'Toole lost out on what would be the first of his of his seven unsuccessful Best Actor nominations.

B00005AXEL|4.0|Stevie's latest effort may seem at first to be less accessible than some of her previous work, but its voluminous charm becomes quickly apparent with each listen. Boasting a cast of multiple producers, including Sheryl Crow and Stevie herself, the album still manages to retain a cohesive feel, thanks in part to a great mixing job by engineer Chris Lord-Alge but also due to Stevie taking a more hands-on approach than on previous albums. Twenty years after her first solo release, Stevie is hitting full stride as a recording artist and songwriter.<br />The tracks produced by Sheryl Crow have a rootsy, acoustic flavour reminiscent of her own self-produced albums. Best of these tracks would be the rocking &quot;That Made Me Stronger&quot; and the quiet acoustic-guitar ballad &quot;It's Only Love.&quot; Other highlights include &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot;, a majestic rocker, &quot;Love Changes&quot;, an economical-yet-hard-hitting production, and &quot;Bombay Sapphires&quot;, a solo Stevie-Nicks-produced track with a strong Police influence.<br />All in all, this is a very likeable album and a crowning achievement for an already stellar career. Go spend some quality time in Stevie's paradise...
B000002J0B|5.0|I was just looking through some old Zeppelin albums one day, and I came across this one, ironically the only album by them I hadn't heard.  When I saw track 2, I almost had a heart attack.  &quot;Rain Song&quot;?!  I'd never even heard of it!  This was too good to be true!  Eagerly, I bought the album and listened to it.  &quot;Rain Song&quot; is amazing!  It instantly became one of my favorite songs.  So slow and melodic, rainy perfection.  This is light years ahead of &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot;.  And guess what?  Every other song is great too.  Zeppelin's greatest, for sure.  RAAAAAAAAAIIIINNN!
0871137380|5.0|Mark Bowden's Battle of Mogadishu narrative is as incisive and entertaining a military novel ever written.  &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is the non-fiction account of the U.S. military's protracted ground encounter with Somali soldiers and citizens on October 3, 1993 and is based largely on extensive interviews with participants on both sides as well as a thorough literature and document review (to include available radio transmissions).<br />This 400+ page, detailed account runs systematically and (reads) rapidly through the events of the afternoon of October 3rd and on through the evening's neverending firefight into the next morning.  Bowden begins with the daring daylight raid and abduction of two top-ranking officials of Somali warlord Mohamed Aided in the midst of Sunday's busy Mogadishu market.  Planned as a sixty-minute helicopter drop, grab and return-to-base, this mission (through various misfortunes and unforseen events)  quickly goes sour and Bowden takes the reader right into the action--inside the minds of those on the ground (and those in the helicopters above the city).  The pace quickens as first one, then another Black Hawk is shot from the sky by RPG-slinging Somalis.<br />Bowden manages to carefully detail the soldiers' moves and thoughts as they attempt to rescue their downed compatriots, extract their killed and wounded, and complete the mission.  In spite of the detail and the multiple points of view (the narration is told from the perspective of many of the participants (to include an occasional glimpse into the Somali viewpoint)), the story moves at breakneck speed to its inevitable, somewhat remarkable conclusion and the end of U.S. involvement in Somalia.<br />This story is an emotional, insightful, occasionally graphic (gory), honest, and ultimately thought-provoking tribute to the brave soldiers who fought in this battle.  Mark Bowden's &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; reads like an enthralling combination of the best war fiction (for example,Michael Shaara's &quot;Killer Angels&quot;) with the greatest military memoirs (e.g., U.S. Grant's &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;).  &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is engaging from start to finish and is one of the most intense books of any genre I have ever read.  Very Highly Recommended.

B000002H38|5.0|Anita Baker broke through the tradition of R&amp;B in 1986 with Rapture. Although her second record, Rapture showed her with an very sexy voice, and an mature sound that became tradtional. All of the tracks are classics. From You Bring Me Joy, to Sweet Love, to Caught Up In The Rapture, Anita showed that people always come back to basic R&amp;B. While Rap and Hip Hop were starting to form, very few people believed that old school would remain the constant at that time. Anita Baker really showed it with Rapture. 15 Years after its release, people still are catching into the Rapture of Anita Baker.
0790742780|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, and I found it even oddly cathartic. Who hasn't felt frustration working through life? This movie is often criticised for using stereotypes and being full of contrived scenes. All true, but the story moves right along at a great pace, and Douglas gives a great performance, as does duvall as a weather-beaten cop near the end of his career. True, it may not be taught in film schools, but I found it extremely watchable and great fun. One of the final shots of Douglas, sprinting along a peer toward his wife, is extrememly powerful and haunting. Suffice to say, it was a movie that sort of crept up on me (not expecting much from it), and certain scenes have stayed with me
B000002H6C|5.0|This is my personal favourite Metallica album.  It's angry and agressive and anti-authority.... just what every angst ridden teenager needs...  not Linkin Park for crissake!!  The track lengths may be around 10 minutes long, but you won't get bored with it because of the sheer variation in the riffs!  Lead solos from the &quot;axe master&quot; Kirk just make the album even better!<br />It's the first metal album i'd ever heard and it converted me!
6300251616|1.0|This is one of the most God awful films I've ever seen.  Except for the interaction with the bomb, it was boooorrrring!  In one interminal scene, one of the characters farts around with a beach ball for cryin' out loud!<br />  Don't waste your money on this dog.
0671027379|4.0|This is a good-to-excellent novel involving alien life-forms, NASA, and Washington politics at the highest levels. Dan Brown obviously has a wealth of knowledge concerning the national intelligence community, the space programs and how the White House operates.  This knowledge has been translated into an exciting story that is solidly based on sound scientific background. This is a real techno-thriller with great characters and a tricky plot.<br />If fact, the plot is a little too tricky. Everything twists and turns upon itself and it the basic truths all become lies.  This keeps the reader guessing, but gets a little tiresome. All basic assumptions can't really be false- can they?<br />Definitely an author worth adding to your list.
078401213X|5.0|A powerful movie. Gritty, high contrast b/w images, rundown locales,  excellent, frenetic score sweeps you along in a dizzying madness.<br />The core of the movie is about Max, who looked into the sun too long as a child, causing him to have intense migraines for the rest of his life. As an implied side-effect, Max has immense capabilities to notice, process and understand numbers - from performing long multiplication for his neighbour, to patterns in leaves, and, just out of reach, the stockmarket...Just out of reach, but close enough for others to get interested.<br />The irony is, for someone who can handle so much compexity, Max is struggling to cope with the simple realities of day to day life, love and co-existence, with dramatic results.

When I bought my copy about 15 years ago, I kind of stumbled over it in a bargain book store because the shop was selling it out for twenty bucks. Only years later it sort of got famous. Probably it didnt sell well because the average reader isnt in the animation buisness.  But if you are already or you want to be in the buisness, try everything to get a copy. Even 150 bucks is still cheap compared to the value you get. I mean, a photographer pays ten thousands of dollars for his equipment. An animator only needs a pegbar, an electric pencil-sharpener and this book!
B000002579|3.0|KANSAS got a little too progressive and wierd on this album<br />and POINT OF KNOW RETURN. Most of the album has the band showing<br />off(e.g. Keith Emerson) to the detriment of the songs. I know<br />alot of KANSAS fans consider this and POINT essential Kansas al-<br />bums, but I really don't. HOWEVER, I do recommend this album on<br />the strength of it's first three songs. \\"Carry On \\"; if you're<br />not sick to death of hearing it on the radio, is a bonafide<br />hard rock classic, featuring some amazing singing by Steve Walsh<br />and some truly terrific guitar interplay between Livgrin and<br />Williams. \\"The Wall\\" is one of their best prog rock songs ever<br />and is one of the most melodic songs they ever did. My favorite<br />song on the album, however, is \\"What's on my mind\\". I always<br />thought that KANSAS were at their best when they were rocking<br />out and they definitely do that on this wonderful song. Again,<br />Steve Walsh,( what a voice this guy used to have!)sounds terrific<br />on this song. I was thrilled to hear KANSAS play this song when<br />I saw them in concert back in 1994! As for the rest..well, it's<br />very well produced, but the second half of the album is quite<br />weak! Still, LEFTOVERTURE is an album worth owning.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|but I cried through this whole cd the first time I played it. The cd hasn't left my cd player yet. Like everyone else, I just bought the cd so I wouldn't have to wait for the radio to play Hero. As it turned out, I love the whole cd, and Hero isn't even't my favorite song anymore! I cried through Escape, Hero, and Maybe. One Night Stand made me laugh and cry at the same time because it's so sad, and the same time, some of the lyrics are so off the wall. She Be The One is the one where you're going, did he just say what I think he said? Chances are, he probably did! My all time favorite though is If The World Comes Crashing Down. The title is just a tad too timely and I didn't cry through this one, I sobbed the whole time! I was still snifling when I went to bed!<br />All in all, this is a great cd. I never thought I would buy an Enrique cd, but I did and I'm not sorry at all. It will make you cry, laugh, dance, sing, and what more could you want?!?
B00005RDVW|4.0|Even though I'm a teenager, I still love this movie! Everything it is superb! <BR>     <BR>     One of the things that amazes me each time I watch it is the animation. The colors are absolutely gorgeous, and the views from above England and Never Never Land are truly stunning.<BR>     <BR>     &quot;Peter Pan&quot; also has a great musical score. One of the best songs is &quot;You Can Fly,&quot; sung while the children are flying over London. <BR>     <BR>     The one problem I had with this movie was that there were almost no solos. After awhile, you may get tired of hearing the chorus.<BR>     <BR>     Otherwise, this a fabulous movie. I recommend it to everyone!
B000006V5H|5.0|It starts with the anthemic 'You're the voice' and then just gets better. As the guy gets older his music gets stronger. Listen and enjoy, you won't be dissapointed. I guarantee it and no I don't work for the record company.
B00004RYZT|5.0|If you are a hardcore Rammstein fan, this is a must have! DVD or VHS, both are required in your library.  The only bad thing is, is that they cut out &quot;Bck Dich&quot;, but make up for it with the video for &quot;Stripped&quot; (mmm hidden features!) and an interview.  If you haven't had a chance to see them live on tour, this is the next best thing.  From Till's entrance on &quot;Spiel mit mir&quot; to his quiet, soothing &quot;Seemann&quot;, this video is action packed with an awesome stage set, and enough pyro to make a US fire marshall have a heart attack, and of course, the music and costumes. Get your copy today! DO IT! :)

0060977493|5.0|A beautifully-written novel, although filled with melancholy, death, and cruelty. Family dynamics are impacted by politics, forbidden love, Westerners, and nature. The lushness of the Southern Indian landscape is brought to life through the details--a bird, an insect, a plant. The author writes with an eloquent playfulness (at times ridiculous) and frequent repetition, which kind of turns the novel into poetry. Also courageously written, touching upon issues rarely mentioned outwardly in Indian culture, and especially by Indian women.<br />I traveled to India 4 years ago as a student, didn't stay there long, (hard to fit in, being an almost 6 foot tall black woman-many stares) but I will always be fascinated by Indian culture and literature.
0446677450|4.0|Athough not the most spell-binding book I have read, it does a good job informing and explaining to the reader how to make money. I found the book interesting while motivating me to read other books of finacial literacy.
0783225849|5.0|Everyone knows of the shower scene &quot;Psycho,&quot; and most people know the ending even if they haven't seen it.  Even so, I won't reveal it here.  Unfortunately, I knew the ending before I watched it, and even so, the film is amazing.  The black &amp; white photography gives it just the right look, and the acting is right on target.  Sometimes in old movies, the acting comes across as cheesy, but in &quot;Psycho,&quot; it's totally believeable.  Norman Bates and the unseen &quot;mother&quot; are great.  Janet Leigh has a good scream, and that musical score gives me chills every time (REEE! REEE! REEE! REEE!).  If you're not into horror movies or haven't seen any movies by the Master of Suspense, then be sure to see this one first, and then take a shower!  We all go a little mad sometimes!
0440219078|4.0|The Giver was an excellent book that would inspire one's imagination into the limitless number of memories and feelings the main characters in the book embark upon.  while some of the issues discussed may not be appropriate for all readers I did not personally find any of the concepts offensive. In addition,  this was a great coming of age book that I would personnally recomend to all your young-adult readers.
0380018179|4.0|Many other reviewers have described this book as romantic, and indeed it is.  Its pituresque rural settings, clear-cut characters, and impossible situtations make the book ripe for drama.  And indeed drama does occur and often, making this rather lengthy book a surprisingly quick read.  <br />Its characters, as mentioned before, have very defining virtures and flaws, chracteristics to which they cling to adamently, as they bring the readers no surprises by their actions.  This does not make their actions boring, however, as McCullough exhausts possibilities (mostly sexual) with each character before killing them off and concentrating on the next generation.  <br />This book's tragic ending (I'm not giving anything away her- the introductory poem alludes to this much) has disappointed many expecting their fairytale romance to end happily.  I did not think the ending failed for its depressing nature, however, but moreover because it was an attempt to tack a theme on a story at the last possible moment.  The theme did interest me, but I would have appreciated it if it had been more religiously applied throughout the work, instead of only in the title, the introductory poem, and the conclusion.  This flaw wasn't a major distraction, however, and on the whole, &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; is definitely worth a read.
0440234743|4.0|I've always loved John Grisham (The Partner was my favorite until reading The Testament), and I was pleasantly shocked to find such outright spiritualty oozing from Grisham's pen.  I saw much of myself in the character of Nate (though I'm neither an alcoholic nor twice divorced), and was only disappointed that we aren't able to see how his spiritual journey progresses.  What this story does show us is how readily grace is available to us all.  When we are at our worst, we can still be used to accomplish something bigger.  God has faith in us -- he's created us to do big things -- and all we need to do is learn to lean on his strength rather than our own.  Watching Nate come to this conclusion was one of my favorite aspects of this book.  This is a truly satisfying read!
0966638328|5.0|This book really hits the nail on the head when it comes to the psychology of color. I especially like the real-life examples of color advertisements that utilize specific hues to create a specific impact. Nicely laid out and a pleasure to browse, it could double as a coffeetable book. A great reference, whether I'm working on a website or thinking about how to rearrange my living room.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|I was introduced to Dire Straits as a teenager when the legendary hit &quot;Money For Nothing&quot; hit the airwaves.  After hearing that as well as the undeniably catchy and also classic &quot;Walk Of Life&quot;, I knew I had to get this album.  Those songs along with the low-key but also catchy leadoff track and third single &quot;So Far Away&quot; got this album off to a great start.  But at the time (silly youth that I was), I was disappointed with the rest of the album, as I didn't find the non-hits nearly as catchy or memorable.  I guess I was hoping for more tunes as heavy as &quot;Money For Nothing&quot;, while there is nothing else like that on the album.<br />Over time, however, I have grown to truly appreciate this album.  That has increased even further with a recent purchase of this album on CD--replacing the cassette I had for years.  Besides the aformentioned big hits, songs like the jazzy &quot;Your Latest Trick&quot;, the mellow but pretty &quot;Why Worry&quot;, the rhythmic and somewhat mystical &quot;Ride Across The River&quot;, and the catchy and slightly uptempo &quot;One World&quot; all sound fantastic.  Turn this CD up pretty loud and listen to the crispness of the production--you truly can't beat it.  To this day I consider this a very fine classic rock set from the mid-'80s.  Still an essential listen.  I actually rate this more along the lines of 4 1/2 stars.
0316776963|5.0|(...) I rarely buy a book when I do not know what it's about...but this was an impulse buy. I have never been so entertained with a book in my life!!!! Absolutely hilarious and intelligently sarcastic...my type of book! I now have tickets to hear him lecture and have already bought his other books, which i'm sure will be equally entertaining.
B000002MUN|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when this came out just a year after the fantastic greatest hits collection was released.  The tracks are more numerous and lengthier than on previous efforts.  The other Tom Petty album without the Heartbreakers, the classic &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; was a 12-track 40-minute effort, while this one clocks in at 15 tracks and about 75 minutes.  But for sure, the quality is most definitely there.<br />&quot;You Don't Know How It Feels&quot; is a vintage Tom Petty single, with the harmonica adding a nice touch.  &quot;You Wreck Me&quot; is an awesome driving track, comparable with &quot;Running Down A Dream&quot;.  &quot;It's Good To Be King&quot; is a quirky and mildly cynical song with a nice keyboard.  &quot;Only A Broken Heart&quot; is a sweet song with a touching lyric and pretty organ sound in parts.  &quot;Honey Bee&quot; and &quot;Don't Fade On Me&quot; are vintage Petty with their vocal arrangements.  &quot;House In The Woods&quot; is another standout track relatively late on the album with the classic Petty &quot;droning&quot; sound.<br />All in all, another strong album by an artist who has always excelled in creating simple yet masterful music.  This album stands right with other previous classic efforts.
B00005QGAT|5.0|I remember this album VERY well! I bought this and  the Thriller one the other one here on Friday and I was totally blown away by it. I loved the demos and the interviews on the CD too. <BR>I liked most of the up tempo songs. She's out of my Life has me crying too.<br />When you listen to it, it sounds so full of life and some heartfelt emotion... You could really tell that the man was going to really be big in the pop music business...<br />I look forward to buying the others here in the future.... This Rocks all that Bee Gees Disco clean out!!!!!
B00000AFDW|5.0|Why the criticism of this album?  Yes, Gene and Paul have big egos, and yes, Ace and Peter should have been featured more.  That being said, how about the songs themselves?  If you are a fan of any era of Kiss, there is something for you here.<br />The opening track &quot;Psycho Cirus&quot;, which was also the lead single, gets things off perfectly.  I was pumped beyond belief when I first heard that song--a true return to vintage form!  You have the fun, cheesy rocking tracks like &quot;I Pledge Allegiance...&quot; and &quot;You Wanted The Best&quot;.  I totally agree with the reviewer who says that &quot;You Wanted The Best&quot; was a poor choice for a second single, and I agree that the accoustic and anthemic &quot;We Are One&quot; would have been a great choice.  What a fun, catchy, heartfelt song that is a joy to listen and sing along to.  I also like the darker modern sounds of tracks like &quot;Within&quot; and &quot;Into The Void&quot;, which vary the mood and tempo.  &quot;Raise Your Glasses&quot; and &quot;Dreamin'&quot; are very enjoyable melodic power anthems.  Unlike many other reviewers, I even like the ballad &quot;I Finally Found My Way&quot;.  It is a pretty and emotional song that is worth having a slow dance to.  The track that actually gets the least notice by me is the last one--&quot;Journey Of 1,000 Years&quot;, but it too is a decent track with a kind of modern sound.<br />In summary, is this album a worthy addition to any Kiss fan's collection?  In my estimation, absolutely!  This is the best thing they have put out in 15 years, and the first thing I bought by them since &quot;Smashes, Thrashes, and Hits&quot;.  Surely an enjoyable effort that continues the Kiss legacy proudly.
B00000IGGA|5.0|For anyone reading this who has not yet experienced Tom Waits, be warned. This is not an easy artist to get a grip on. You have to learn to get beyond a voice that at times sounds like a cross between Yosemite Sam with throat polyps and the Budweiser Frogs. If you can do that, what awaits you is an artist who can spin a yarn with the compassion and wit of Mark Twain. He shows the humanity of people walking a side of life that few of us would dare to look at, let alone walk in their shoes. He can give you a taste of a pig roasted over the flames of a box spring mattress, a paranoid busybody neighbor, a murderer seeking penance, a hangover in a jail cell, and then turn around and sing a love song with the sweetest, tender lyrics with that croak of a voice. <br />It's his flair for poetry and his humor that hooked me over 20 years ago during his beatnik lounge lizard period, which is a far cry from what began to evolve in the 80's to the present. His voice was better in those days, but what he was doing back then could only be taken so far. Over the years, he seemed to gain some influence from Captain Beefheart, but he's still a true American original. He's taken every aspect of the Blues and turned them inside out. There are two songs here that reveal a Beefheart influence: &quot;Big In Japan&quot; and &quot;Filipino Box Spring Hog&quot;. The latter of which is sidesplitingly funny.<BR>Overall, I liked this disc better than &quot;Bone Machine&quot;. It's cut from the same cloth, but easier to digest. I think it's a more well rounded effort and shows that he still has the flair for writing a touching ballad as well as showing his acid wit. There's even a gospel flavored song to close out the disc. &quot;Come On Up To The House&quot; Much of his work has a spiritual tone to it, though I doubt that he subscribes to any organized faith. Especially when you hear him growling out &quot;Come down off the cross. We can use the wood&quot;<br />Waits is a genius who will not betruly appreciated till he's left this world. In his own words: &quot;The World Is Not My Home. I Just A Passin Through. Come On Up To The House&quot;
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil Collins was everywhere in the 1980s and early '90s.  From his Genesis work to his solo stuff, he was heard on the air with new music each and every year from 1980 through 1993.  An unbelievable run by a very talented musician with one of the best voices in popular music history.  The songs on this solo collection speak for themselves:  from the mystical &quot;In The Air Tonight&quot; and &quot;One More Night&quot; to the catchy &quot;Susudio&quot; and &quot;Easy Lover&quot; to the downright beautiful &quot;Against All Odds&quot; and &quot;Separate Lives&quot;.  Even the remake of &quot;True Colors&quot; by Cyndi Lauper (which I was not too fond of in its original form) is nice.  At least one track is included from each and every Phil solo album, and all of those movie soundtrack songs that were big hits are included.  Once I bought this collection I was able to clean out a few record singles!<br />Now the downside, as is often the case with artists who have as much great material and hits as Phil has that decide to put out greatest hits albums:  there are several key songs missing.  A chronological list of other songs I would liked to have seen is as follows:  &quot;Missed Again&quot;, &quot;I Don't Care Anymore&quot;, &quot;Don't Forget My Number&quot;, &quot;Inside Out&quot;, &quot;We Said Hello Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Do You Remember&quot;, &quot;Hang In Long Enough&quot;, and &quot;Everyday&quot;.  Throw that in with some other album tracks and maybe a few rarities if they exist, and you could have easily made this a two-disk set.<br />No matter.  This collection is still very enjoyable if you're a fan of the man, his music, and his amazing voice.  Definitely a worthwhile listen that is guaranteed to bring back memories.
B00003TL18|2.0|This CD is a reissue of the 1989 release A Black and White Night Live, with an extra song tacked on the end.<br />I usually prefer the power and energy of live music of studio music. On the surface, this should be an explosive album with Roy Orbison singing live, backed by some sensational stars, such as Bruce Springsting and Bonnie Raitt.<br />Unfortunately, Orbison's voice is weak, with none of the power you would hear on his old recordings. He sings flatter, with none of the emotion and range he used to show. He died shortly after this CD was recorded (it was released after his death).<br />None of the guest musicians really add anything to this CD. It could have been any studio band backing him up. In some cases, it probably would have been better, because a studio or touring band would have been better rehearsed.<br />I just saw an old black and white Ed Sullivan clip with Roy Orbison singing Pretty Woman.  It was amazing.  Orbison's voice was so powerful and the band was the prefect back up for the song and his voice.  This CD doesn't come anywhere close.  If you want to remember Roy Orbison at his best, get his old studio recordings.
B00005JKOV|5.0|This movie is far beyond anyone's ability to describe it.  It is not a film for the literally minded.  It is a film for the viewer who feels shackled by commercialism each time they purchase a movie ticket.  It is a film for the person who wants to lets his spirits soar, It is for the person, who really thinks there is more to the universe than McDonalds, George Bush, or the Taliban.  It is for the viewer who has this unfulfilled dream that films are a way of feeding the soul.<br />It is also an astoundingly beautiful experience flowing with the images that are constantly one step ahead of your expectation. <br />Having seen Waking Life just once was not enough.<br />Enjoy, let your spirits loose.<br />Sincerely,<br />Zev
B00005QIPH|5.0|Yes, this band is surrounded by hype.  Yes, you should get over it.  If you think the Strokes sound like the Velvet Underground, let me remind you that Nevermind sounded like the Pixies.  Once again, you should get over it. <BR>     Don't get me wrong.  I'm not saying that Is This It will have the same cultural impact as Nirvana.  I'm just saying that this is the best rock and roll record I've heard in a long time.  After a few dozen spins, I still can't get enough.  Although there are highlights (&quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, &quot;Hard to Explain&quot;), every track is excellent.  Over its 36 minutes, there is no filler, no ballads, just sturdy songwriting, passionate playing, and kicked-out jams.  <BR>     Much has been made over the hype this band has received, especially in the U.K.  Yes, they're photogenic.  Yes, they're signed to a major label.  GET OVER IT.  Abandon all preconceptions and enjoy this album for what it is, a great record
B00003CY0V|5.0|Wow, what an outstanding plot, elite special effects, and spectacular performances! This film is slick, suspenseful, intelligent, and definitely action packed. With one of the most gorgeous explosions that Hollywood has to offer it can't hold a candle to the Matrix, but it's suspense, and special effects match. To appreciate this film to the furthest capacity, one should experience it in 5.1 or greater Dolby Digital sound. Under no doubt, should this film receive an academy award for outstanding special effects. It's amazing what 20 lbs. of C4 can do to an entire block, and then capturing every piece of glass shatter and every wall crack is mind boggling. What even adds more enjoyment to this film is its cast: John Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, and Don Cheadle. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed The Matrix, enjoys out-of-this-world special effects, and/or adores suspense.
B000001AJG|5.0|This is a soundtrack to a movie most people haven't seen. But it does what great soundtracks do: it paints moods.  And how! The melodies on this recording are sublime; they will move you. <br />When I went to view this at Amazon I fully expected a low rating--because it is not a commercially successful record and most people, when recommending Stevie Wonder, will name half a dozen other well-known great albums.  But to my delight, I see from other reviews, others, too, are passionate about this unsung treasure. It must be one of the most underrated albums of all time.
B00004U8P9|2.0|The movie is far too weird and over the top.  The music is it's real redeeming quality.
B0000029DD|5.0|*sigh* I can't believe he was taken from this world so early. I guess you could say he had a fitting end (to lift a line from Jim Morrison)...he produced the perfect record. There isn't a song on here that is bad. His version of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (yes...I'm going to say it) is better than the original. Jeff Buckley's incredible voice makes the song so much better.<br />The album kicks off with my favorite &quot;Mojo Pin.&quot; The halting rhythms and intricate guitar work mount to an incredible finish. Wow, this album is a good one.
B000002J03|5.0|Fun House by the Stooges and Led Zeppelin II are the most mindblowing hard rock albums ever recorded. This music is about absolutely nothing- and that's why it is so powerful! If you can decifer any more meaning from Iggy's liquor-soaked shriek than you can from Plant's bluesy wail, then you must be quite sharp, but these vibes have a meaning all their own! This album is a 180 degree reversal of Led Zep's derivative, self-indulgent first effort. Forget about wasteful digressions and overlong solos, Jimmy knows how make every riff count here. And don't for a minute imagine that the two softer pieces are filler- Thank You and Ramble On are just as immaculately recorded as everything else. The Lemon Song and Whole Lotta Love are the greatest examples ever of Zep's ability to transform a blues cover into mad, drug-addled rock. Plant's voice here is at its absolute finest, and is never annoying as it occasionally is on Zep's later releases. In fact it is a full-fledged rock'n'roll instrument on an equal footing with Bonzo's drums and Pages guitar riffing. Warning- this album is a very, very heavy trip all on its own, so if you plan to take any mind-altering substances whilst listening to Led Zeppelin II, then I hope you know what you're up to.....
0446677450|5.0|I have always said, &quot;I will be rich.&quot;  I never really knew how, but this book has really helped fine tune my financial perspective.  It has changed everything about how I view money.  I am in college right now, and I will be graduating within the next couple years.  I had never been taught this kind of thinking before, I just knew I did not want to be stuck in the &quot;rat race,&quot; and have always wanted to have/own my own business.  I recommend this book as a starting point for anyone who is curious about what their financial plan should be like.  I am about to purchase another book by the author to further expand my financial intelligence, as well as some of the other books he has recommended.  Thanks to Mr. Kiyosaki for helping me how to start out my financial life and &quot;mind my business.&quot;  Great book!
B00001QGPS|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time. this is one of the few CD's i have that i can put in and listen to from begining to end. the first half of the album is the best but the second half is also great. this is a must have for all hiphop fans.
B00004Z459|4.0|&quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is a good debut from this band Linkin Park, and it shows that the band may have alot of potential. The are thrown into the nu-metal mix because their music is a fusion of rap and metal. &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot;, &quot;In The End&quot; are probably the songs that most people are familiar with if they listen to modern rock radio, but there are also some other very good songs on this album. &quot;Papercut&quot;, &quot;With You&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; are also worth a listen to. The band has two singers one who sings the lyrics and the other that raps. It is a good concept that the band is able to pull off. All in all, it is a solid effort and shows that this band has promise. Catch them if you can in concert.
088708026X|5.0|Author Eric Carle (The Very Lonely Firefly, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, The Very Busy Spider) excels in creating books that offer children more than words on a page -- he consistently incorporates additional elements (lights, holes(!), textures) that make the books even more interesting to thirsty little minds.<br /><br />In this book, a smaller portable version of the original, a girl asks her father for the moon.  Fold-out pages complement Carle's unique illustrative style as we discover a looooooong ladder that reaches to the moon and back, and a magnificent four-page center spread revealing the full moon in all its glory.<br /><br />This fantastic tale for young children is sure to delight parents and kids.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|If you are a new fan of Lenny Kravitz, this is the perfect album to start you collection with. Here you have the rockin' sounds of &quot;Fly Away&quot;,&quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way&quot;, &quot;American Woman&quot;, along with the ballads &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;I Belong To You&quot;, &quot;It Aint Over til It's Over&quot;, and &quot;Stand By My Woman&quot;. &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; is one of his best known songs and it has a Beatlesesque &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; 60's optimistic sound to it. If you own &quot;5&quot; before it was re-released, you can buy this disc and get &quot;American Woman&quot;. The album is what a Greatest Hits is suppossed to be it has all the hits that they fans want, and it will help new fans become acquainted with his music
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I agree with everyone who has lauded the technical artistry of this movie; there is nothing I can add to the admiration everyone feels who sees this film. One thing I haven't heard anyone mention yet, however, is the wonderful message it sends to girls or to anyone who has ever felt less than a perfect &quot;10.&quot; To say more might jeopardize the ending, so suffice it to say that this tale is a twist on the beauty and the beast theme, but has the courage on more than one level not to bale out at the end and pretty the beast up to conform to superficial ideals of romantic love. The movie dares us to accept ourselves as we are and to see women as equals to men. Fiona is quite capable of taking care of herself, thank you very much, and doesn't have to look like, well, like Cameron Diaz to be worthy of love. <BR> I was also very impressed by Mike Myers's performance as Shrek. He completely loses himself in the character; he's at once gruff and vulnerable, and at no time does he grandstand for a cheap laugh. <BR> This is a tale with staying power; one that the whole family can enjoy.
B00005B36H|5.0|While listening to &quot;Lateralus&quot;, I got the sense that I was listening to another classic album, &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;. Is it only me, or does anyone else get that sense when listening to &quot;Laterlus&quot;? This is very great album in my own opinion, I never really gave Tool a listen till I saw the video for &quot;Schism&quot;,but after seeing and hearing the song I had to buy this disc. The whole album is the sum of its parts, nothing that stands out, but taken as a whole, it will stand the test of time, and I think that this will be an album that we may be talking about 5,10,15 years down the road. The thing that I enjoy the most is that the songs have a musical harmony and melodies to them. They start of slow and then they build to a climatic ending. Listen to &quot;The Grudge&quot;, 'Schism&quot;, and &quot;Parabola&quot; to get the meaning of what I am saying. This is a classic album and it is a must for true music fans. This is a more progressive sound than the other type of metal/hard rock out there right now
B00005KHJR|5.0|Once again, a British film classic is released in America before it is here. Multi-region DVD owners will not be bothered but it is a sad reflection on UK distributors that everyone else has to miss out.<br />Christopher Lee calls it the \\"best film\\" he ever made, it has won many an award at film festivals and gained a massive cult following, but The Wicker Man was virtually disowned by the company who made it and sank without trace on its' original release in 1973. This may be because of its' resistance to conform to genre and style but more likely has a lot to do with short sighted money men. Whilst many elements of it are horrific, the film also flirts with notions of suspense, murder mystery and musical along the way.<br />Sergeant Howie's gradual journey to \\"Pagan\\" enlightenment and what it ultimately means to him is handled so masterfully by both writer Shaffer and director Hardy that the final revelation is almost as shocking to us as it is to the unfortunate police officer. The film questions those who manipulate religion for there own ends and the very nature of religion itself, and comes to some pretty uncomfortable conclusions. Both his saviour and his downfall, Howie's strict Catholicism is a double-edged sword that cuts little ice on the island of Summerisle. No matter how bizarre the Pagan rituals adhered to there seem to Howie or the viewer, they are based on the same sort of unshakeable methodology inherent in all religion. The ancient civilisations of South America had similar beliefs in terms of sacrifice, and whose to say they were wrong?<br />As well as being mind-enhancing, the film is incredibly well plotted. Led to believe it is a straightforward thriller that will end happily the viewer becomes as much a fool as Howie when confronted with the foreboding Wicker Man, and everything it has come to represent. The murder sub-plot is exposed as the diversion it was all along and the viewer left with a distinctly nasty taste in his mouth.<br />Otherfactors that add to the film's impact are the performances, which are excellent, and the cinematography, which belies the tiny budget.<br />As for the disc itself, Anchor Bay has gone to a lot of effort to offer both the truncated version and crucially the rare longer cut of the film. Whilst the extra footage in this longer version is of a lesser quality than the rest of the film the scenes are most definitely worth seeing and should not have been taken out in the first place. Apparently, the added scenes were only available from a video print and so, understandably, could not be better restored, but well done to Anchor Bay for at least providing them. When one considers the fact that more footage was (allegedly) buried under a motorway then one should be grateful for small mercies I suppose.<br />The documentary is solid and should be commended for featuring as many of those involved as possible and the trailers and tv spots are all present and correct. <br />A commentary would have been nice but there is an added Easter egg which is easy to find on the special features page and although really only watchable once it is hilarious. It is a poor recording of a regional American arts programme featuring an interview with Christopher Lee and Robin Hardy during the film's second release in America. It is presented by a man who cannot go longer than five seconds without saying \\"er\\" and includes an embarrassing moment in which a very confident Christopher Lee starts singing opera... and can't stop.<BR>To cap it all, the special edition of the DVD comes in a handsome wooden case. For the film alone however, the purchase is must have.
0316779237|4.0|Sedaris' work makes me laugh, and this book was no exception. His wit is dry and sardonic, and really, what better target for irreverent wit than the holiday season.  His short stories are all rooted in his life history, his recounting of truly hillarious incidences.  I loved this book, and recommend it to anyone who appreciates dry humor.  If you want to be amused, read his work.
B00005ASHM|5.0|It hurts to know music this amazing is out there. I will never in a million years grow tired of listening to this album. Even now after overplaying it way more than almost any album of it's era I still get excited, hearing those first few minimal notes of &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; to the lone drum beat, and then a machine of awesome force pumps out these amazing harmonics and productions that blow my mind. You eagerly listen for that little bass line that you LOVE from &quot;Here To Day&quot; (be careful, it's only the tiniest portion of the song and it only comes once...)<BR>Pet Sounds is full of wonderful things like this, you spend your time going &quot;Now how did they get that sound&quot; and &quot;What kind of instrument is that?&quot;<BR>This is like all the greatest paintings of the world. People are obsessed with them, the painting is accused of being overrated, many people shun the work because it's TOO popular, too many people like it. But, like those great works of art, or books, or movies or whatever, there are many, a great many, that are loved by so many people, because it's just that good. That is Pet Sounds. It's love by so many people because it's just that good. <BR>This album, and the sadly neglected albums that follow soon after, proves straight forward that the Beach Boys are not a novelty surf band (Sloop John B is the only mention of even WATER in the entire album, and it doesn't even refer to surfing) but that Brian Wilson is a musical genius and as influential as the songwriters of his time (the Beatles weren't the only great band from 1967 to 1970).  Also note, the cover, they're wearing jackets... it does not appear to be surfing weather.  I've always considered this an autumn album.<BR>Everyone will tell you &quot;Sloop John B&quot; and &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; are the highlights. Yes these are phenomenal tracks, amazing heart stopping tracks, but don't get a greatest hits with those to because there's so much more you missout on.<BR>It's just an impressive, pleasing amazingly beautiful album...  And necessary in any music lovers collection.  If you own Sgt. Peppers, and not this album, you're missing out.  At risk of losing respect as a music lover, I own this, and have yet to get my own copy of Sgt. Peppers. I think I'm not missing out on as much as I would were I to not own Pet Sounds.
0446677450|5.0|Well...considering I am a teenager reading this book, I was very impressed.   A teenager's ability to sit and read a book without being tempted to wander off into their own world is highly likely, but this book read like a story with an important message.   It explained the differences between rich people and poor people in such a way that even I wanted to continue reading.   Maybe a teenager's mind might wander because they feel like they don't have to worry about money, but this book explains the importance of knowing what you wnat to become, a Rich Man, or a Poor Man.   At the age of nine, Kiyosaki knew who he wanted to become, and with this book he helped me realize what I must do in order to become who I want to be.
B00005ABX0|4.0|Long story short...<BR>Brian Wilson creates Pet Sounds, his career up to the making up Pet Sounds has been on the up and up...  He just keeps getting better, his band just keeps getting better, the albums they make just keep getting better...  This is a pretty standard rock n roll story, that like most has a tragic ending...  <BR>So then Brian and his crew create Pet Sounds, which goes down in history as one of the greatest pop albums ever recorded.  The sound the quality, the song writing, everything about it is amazing.<BR>Brian Wilson of course wants to create an even better album, and in many ways he does.  He starts to create that great album, but as a result of problems with the record contract, problems with the band, problems with motivation, problems with everything, it gets flopped and canned.  An album, then titled \\"Smile\\" was supposed to be released before Sgt. Peppers, and had it, the history of rock would've looked a little different, and the band in the foreground changing rock and roll would not have been quite so dominated by the Beatles.<BR>Smile might've been the greatest album the Beach Boys ever released, or at the very least, on the caliber of Pet Sounds.  Fans, discouraged by the hype and long wait are given Smiley Smile, what Carl Wilson called \\"a bunt instead of a grand slam,\\" and the album fades into history.<BR>But people, IT'S SO GOOD!  I know that I will admit this, and every Beach Boy will admit this, it's not Pet Sounds, but it's good.  Listening to songs like \\"Heroes and Villians\\" and \\"Little Pad\\" you can see just how good it was supposed to be.  The talent, the sheer unstoppable amazing talent of this band is SO abundantly clear here.  The only thing holding this album back is that it is the scrapings of a discouraged project.  This is a half finished art project, that was supposed to be the most amazing thing ever produced, take the hype, return with a \\"sorry guys, not as good as I wanted it to be\\" leads to a recipe for a lost LP.It's STILL a good album, a great album even.  It doesn't HAVE to live up to Pet Sounds.<BR>Listen to the harmonies, listen to their voices, everything about this album is delightful.  <BR>The continuing story on this CD is the LP \\"Wild Honey.\\"  Wild Honey is the result of the guys wanting to have some fun with their music for a change, rather than stressing it, and not putting a great amount of effort into the production.  After the disappointment of Smiley Smile, this wasn't exactly what fans were looking for.  It's fun though, and like Smiley Smile, it's still good.  Listening to this I see a direct influence years down the road on the album \\"Whatever and Ever Amen\\" by the Ben Folds Five.  (...)<BR>\\"Country Air\\" is a big highlight for me, it's simple but beautiful which is all that's needed for a good song.<BR>This is a great CD for the albums themselves, but also good for looking at what was going on with the Beach Boys after Pet Sounds and really makes you understand why the following music didn't take off as well as their earlier productions.<BR>True all good things must come to an end, but in this case the only thing that ended was their popularity.
0780622553|4.0|Why was this movie panned?<br />It could have been several things.<br />Lack of backing by New Line Cinema, the fact that it was a dark science-fiction film, lack of press, lack of decent release-scheduling, a slightly &quot;unattractive&quot; cast...where do you begin???<br />Well, plain and simple fact is, you have to forget all that and watch this movie. I found it by complete accident while doing some trailer-searching on the 'Net. I had seen this trailer kinda sitting on its own in the dark(how convenient). After downloading every trailer but that one, I finally gave it a try. I wasn't disappointed. It looked like a cross between a dark fairy-tale and Clive Barker's HELLRAISER. Beyond that, it featured a really cool trailer-score(done by Hughes Howard called &quot;Sleep Now&quot;) that thumped ominously in the background while dark visions of noir-ish heroes and gravity-defying villians took to the foreground.<br />The movie is actually JUST LIKE THE TRAILER. This means you pays your money and ya' gets what you pays for. This is good. This is very good. Trevor Jones's awesome ambient score is his best since THE DARK CRYSTAL and MERLIN as we are told the story of a city inhabited by total and indefinite darkness. The four main(human) characters are integral to the movement of the plot. Rufus Sewell plays his character, John Murdock with a brilliant paranoid edge. We see his character grow as his journey of discovery begins with a mysterious re-birth. He knows not why he lives or breathes but he does. The only clues to his identity are a broken syringe on the floor, a bloody knife, and a dead prostitute, and they don't exactly function as guides.<br />Murdock later discovers that he has a wife played by the strikingly gorgeous Jennifer Connoly and that he was seeking treatment from a seemingly whacked-out doctor(Keifer Sutherland). But that's not all...he's got some sort of psycho-kinetic power that allows him to move, destroy, or create objects...but it seems to be mood-related and twitchy.<br />Meanwhile, an open-minded detective(William Hurt) wants to know why the prostitute has turned up dead in the hotel room across town and where his suspect has run off to. There's also a group of mysterious people ALSO looking for Murdock. They're called &quot;The Strangers&quot;. They dress in fedora hats and trenchcoats and have extremely pale skin...oh yes, they ALSO have the same telepathic abilities Murdock has...and the Strangers want Murdock BAD.<br />Sorry for the long description. I just had to qualm the doubters who said this film has &quot;style over substance&quot;. It has a LOT more than that.<br />The big, beautiful, noir-homage sets are something to admire. Had Kafka been alive now, he would have been sleeping in the alleyways, rolling in the puddles of rain and mud to soak up the mood. Think METROPOLIS, only with more a tad more color and attitude. This is one of the coolest sets since Tim Burton's BATMAN.<br />The DVD is a treat indeed. We get not one, but TWO commentary tracks. The best one is by critic Roger Ebert, who put this film on his &quot;Ten Best&quot; list and deservedly so. Another track features Trevor Jones's brilliant score. The rest of the disc features a cute little &quot;game&quot; where you get to find &quot;Shell Beach&quot;, set designs, the trailer for the film, and news-clippings of reviews and comparisons to METROPOLIS. The movie also comes in Widescreen and Pan-and-Scan. The picture is perfect and as always, New Line does a great job with the sound.<br />This movie is a science-fiction classic in my book and has what so many sci-fi tales lack: the search for the human soul among increasing technology. Pure brilliance. Let's hope that director Alex Proyas(THE CROW) can keep his winning-streak alive and going.<br />--Mattbe mood-related and twitchy.<br />Meanwhile, an open-minded detective(William Hurt) wants to know why the prostitute has turned up dead in the hotel room across town and where his suspect has run off to.

0451078721|4.0|Stephen King is a great writter. His books are so involving tht when you read the shining you will enjoy it even though it gets hard to read in some parts. I read this book for a class in school and it was hard to read but Im glad i got the chance to read it. The shining was a relly good book. It wasone of S0tephen Kings better books other than Carrie and Salem's Lot. That is it.
B00005OM4K|5.0|Based on the music contained on this box set, it surely ranks 5 stars. To date, no other American band has been able to recreate the musical success that CCR had in the late 60s/early 70s. To some, the music may seemed cliched, but that's only because the songs have become American standards. <br />And unlike many other bands, the album cuts rank right up there alongside the singles in terms of quality. In fact, it's a shame that some songs are forgotten through the pile of hits CCR created. A song like Effigy is as powerful as any of the hits.<br />If you only own Chronicle or a handful of the original vinyl or the first pressing CDs (not the remasters), then this box is in every sense of the word essential. It is the beginning and the end of your CCR collection. The early CCR CDs are basically junk compared to the remasters (one listen will verify this). Even those who have accumulated the individual remasters may want to consider selling them off in favor of owning just this box. The first discs covers the early years and much of the material is appearing in public for the very first time (even bootlegs have missed some of this stuff). And while the Golliwogs (pre-CCR) material isn't always up to the same snuff as the later material, there are some wonderful songs to be had (Fight Fire is the hit they should've had...it had my wife singing after one listen). <br />If the first disc is all you're after, you may want to wait and see if Fantasy decides to release that one seperate from the box (the Doors did the same with their box set...though they put one extra track on the single disc, making fans shell out the money once again). But really, one can't go wrong in buying this box.

B00005O5N1|2.0|I was very excited to see the movie after reading both Bridget Jones books.  When I saw the video, though, I was disappointed.  I understand that it's a movie and that they couldn't keep all of the good stuff, but there was almost none of the good stuff.  Sure some of the scenes they kept in there (like the &quot;Tarts&quot; party) were well done, but there were some even funnier scenes in the book!  I think her friends were only in one or two scenes, and the same with her parents.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm glad I saw the movie for free and didn't go buy it first, like i had originally planned on doing.  Don't get me wrong.  I think the actors and crew did a wonderful job with what they were given, I just think that there could have been more done with the script.  So, I guess what I'd like you to know is that you should rent the movie first before buying it.
B00003CXA3|5.0|As a native New Yorker it's easy to pick out flaws in movies about New York. It might be a shot of some homeless guy asleep in a doorway and he's got a brand new shoe shine...or something equally out of sync. That's not the case with this baby. The shots of New York, the dialog between Popeye Dolye and partner Sonny Garraso, the general feel of the late night haunts of Manhattan, all ring so picture-perfect. This has got to be the absolute best cop movie of all time. <br />As a side note, I met a guy whose father was involved in the real life FC affair. He eventually did eight years at Denamoura, an upstate New York correctional facility. Although he sited some obvious inaccuracies with the real life events, he did agree that the movie excelled in portaying the overall story with tremendous authenticity and great atmosphere.<br />And if all this were not enough, what about that car chase to end all car chases? Watch it with the sound turned all the way up and hold on to your seat. You may want to buckle-up, just in case!
B00003CY0V|3.0|This is a sweet DVD and movie. It is a combo of the Matrix and Gone in 60 seconds if you dont like characters who act human  then dont get this movie. Or if you dont like plots that have twists then you wont like this either.
B00004Z311|5.0|When I saw this movie I was the only one in the theater. I spent large amounts on money, for a 12 year old to see it. I remember a large amount of (...) for Universal in putting out this movie. It was until years later that I found out that the movie had pretty much been cut in two. From 14 reels of film to 7. (...) it is not suprising that universal is taking their own sweet time in getting this out.
0345339703|2.0|I know everyone says Tolkien started it all...blah blah balh...Everyone else is a rip off...blah blah blah.<BR>But I read Hobbit, then I forced myself to finish Fellowship, then got half way through the next book and gave up.<BR>I've got one word for this book...BORING!  Too many songs...I found myself sifting through chapter when Tolkien decides he is going to spend 50 pages on a meal or a night of talking.  <BR>I read these books following  my reading of the Shannara series (Sword, Elfstones, Wishsong) and there is no comparison.  Terry Brook's novels are sooo much more exciting and compelling with the perfect amount of character development and scene descriptions.  I don't 6 pages of a scene description like TOlkien does.  The Hobbit seems like a Childs book to me, since there really isn't much of a evil force.  Fellowship just bored the living hell out of me.  I put the book down for several weeks at a time since I fell asleep just about every time I read it.
0446677450|3.0|This book is a huge dissapointment. Kiyosaki and Lechter managed to waste about a week of my time. This book is 207 pages long. 204 pages of it is not worth reading. What I should have done, is just read the titles of all the chapters, I would've learned just as much. I really regret buying, reading, and ever even hearing about this book. In fact I have some far better business advice to offer everyone out there.... SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! The only thing this book will do for you is make you 15 dollars poorer.
B000002MFN|4.0|I bought Erotica after watching all the videos from this album, i was bowed out of my skin after listening the lyrics of most of the songs , with one track specially in my mind...that is &quot;Secret Garden&quot;... i've read most of these reviews and almost no one speaks about that AMAZING song that can be put together with Madonna's most ground-breaking songs such as &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot; or &quot;impressive Instant&quot;.<BR>Secret Garden is a jazz based song with touches of dance and R&amp;B, something i've never heard before, with surreal lyrics such as BS, this track has an early bjrkish feel to it!... but ..oh dear... in this album we go to the other extreme... with 2 of the worst songs that Madonna has ever recorded!!!, aweful lyrics and incedibly stupid contents , we have the horrible &quot;Thief Of hearts&quot; and the stupid &quot;Words&quot;...i just wanna throw a question...WHAT THE HELL WAS MADONNA THINKING WHEN DOING THESE 2 SONGS!!!!!???? these 2 are clearly made just to fill space... but  thinking back, a 10 or 9 track-album is not bad at all... and that would have saved Erotica a lot of bad critics!!, but anyway...we still have amazing songs left in here such as Deeper and Deeper , one of the best dance tracks of the 90's , Erotica with amazing tunes and extremely smart lyrica!!<BR>but, following Secret Garden as my fav. song here, we have Bad Girl in wich her dry voice sounds so deep and like she is really feeling the song, so dramatic...only compared to her colaboration with Mirwais &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot; it is such a different and heart breaking ballad!! (and lets not start with the breathtaking video for the song!!!!) and then we have all the other dark r&amp;b tunes and mellow songs such as Rain and Why it's so hard, and let's not forget the eye-drying lyrics of &quot;In This Life&quot;.This album it's actually more like a concept than an &quot;album&quot; itself.<BR>this is absolutly a must have!!
0515125024|5.0|Yes, this book is good, read Killing Floor and now this one. I think Die Trying is the better of the two. Jack Reacher is thrown in the back of a panel truck with woman he does not know and by three men he does not know. The woman is being kidnapped and Reacher is along for the ride, and what a ride. From Chicago to wherever it is rough. The story is scary as it could very well be true. If you like a fast paced book with lots of action you will like this. The army and the FBI play politics and that I do not like. Reacher is very good in the mountains. I think you will enjoy reading about the rifle firing at 1000 yards, what a surprise. How did Reacher miss??????? Holly Johnson was something else too. Even with a hurt knee she could take on two or more. Just to much to talk about it all---have to read it.
B00005Q45W|5.0|This is truly a great CD.  Worth the wait.  From a strictly personal point of view, this new songs CD gives me more satisfaction than Bob Dylan's.<br />Yes, the instrumentation in Cohen's songs can be annoying.  The offence committed this time, though, is less serious compared to the past.<br />On first listenings, I like &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; and &quot;Boogie Street&quot;.
6305750750|4.0|The long time awaited Episode I is here, and even though it displays a lot of improvements when it comes to special fx, it wasn't quite what I expected. The plot is ok, the characters are interesting enough and make a lot of sense (except for that Jar Jar Binks fella), and actually starts to make sense when it comes to finding out where all got started. For the Collectors Edition, it's cool to have a frame of the actual movie (that comes enclosed), altough the display mounting lacks of quality (I mean, it's a collector's edition, you could've done better).  Along comes a mini booklet with sketches and drawings of preproduction for Episode I, and the VHS wich claims to have a featurette specially produced for such and edition (I couldn't say if it's true or not, since I didn't purchased any other edition.<br />Bottom line...I give it four 1/2 stars. I enjoyed it very much, and would recommend it for anyone who's a fan of true sci-fi with a twist of action. Enjoy!
B00004XONN|3.0|I can't help but think that this offering from Radiohead was not so much an attempt to explore their musical scope as it was an effort to test the palate of their freshly expanded fan base following the success of &quot;OK Computer.&quot; This is a band that usually pays little attention to popular success or failure; but now that they've experienced a bit of the former, they seem to miss the latter. The result, as it relates to &quot;Kid A,&quot; rests squarely on the fence: some tracks cater to a larger audience, others are so overwrought with a sense of ego gratification that they hold little appeal to anyone outside the band. A mixed bag that contains some moments of beauty in and among a generally painful self-indulgent muddle of electronic noise.
B00004XPP0|5.0|I own the special edition box set (all three movies). I remember when I was like five years old, my dad took me to the movie theater, and introduced me to the first of the movies that later became my all time favorites....Star Wars: A New Hope (Episode IV). From that point on, I got hooked. About the special edition, the extra footage is amazing, the THX sound rocks, and it brings you back to that galaxy far, far away, like the opening was yesterday. The only bad thing is that the special edition was released only on VHS. I wish they would later release a DVD edition. FX are amazing, sound is great, picture quality is pretty good (so far), and the plot of each of the movies....well, if you don't know what I'm talking about right now, GET THE MOVIES, because you're like 20 years behind.<br />Bottom line...classic sci-fi action movies....after all, it's STAR WARS
0465011012|5.0|Twenty years ago I read the Gulag Archipeligo and it changed my life.  All illusions about the Soviets dissolved in the face of the horror.  The Aquariums of Pyongyang may not be the work of literature that Solzhenitsyn produced, but the story is compelling, in part because it is not a story from the past but of current events.   I send my heartfelt thanks to Chol-hwan Kang, first for simply surviving to tell the tale, and then to dredge it up again and tell the world.  Thank you, thank you.  The Cold War is over?  Why?  The evil of Stalinism is alive in this world. We should stare it in the face and recognize those who are suffering because of it.  Read this book.
B00005N9CV|2.0|I'm a Jazz lover who's always eager to learn more about it. The critically acclaimed previous albums of Diana's had made me wondering if it is my uneducated ears that's not finding her music as comparable (if any) to the likes of modern greats. For example, Shirley Horn.  Well, so I bought all of them so I can get educated. However, after buying this one, I am now realizing that I (we) have been taken for a ride, and having more distrust of the reviews from these Jazz \\"experts\\" from reputable magazines and newspapers.
B00003CXTG|1.0|(...) Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale all act up.. well nothing! This is a hideous film, skip it! And don't buy it, it'll be a waste of your hard earned cash!!  If you're looking for an epic see one like The English Patient!
6305364648|4.0|Very good movie but again there is to much blackout on the top and bottom of film, twice as much as usual wide screen movies, again the consumer should have a choice of wide screen formats, this was a great movie, Tom Arnold helps carry the plot, I enjoyed it but with a 20 inch tv there is not much picture to view...
0780625129|5.0|(...) Graphic imagery and excerpts (...), captivating cinematography, universal plot, and actors that are frightfully and alarmingly convincing, make American History X a difficult movie to see, but an impossible one to quit watching. <BR>        Screenplay writer David McKenna doesn&#8217;t beat around the bush; within the first twenty minutes, the whole plot is laid out. The location: Venice Beach, California, a neighborhood that was once white suburbia, but is now plagued with gangs. The influential character: Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a misguided youth seeking revenge for his father&#8217;s death. Derek seeks solace in the D.O.C. (Disciples of Christ), an organization of angry, white extremist skinheads. His anger finally peaks when he brutally kills two black men who were breaking into his car. Derek spends three years in jail, soul-searching, and finds that his rage failed to impact his life. He comes back a changed man, ready to part with his animosity and begin anew. The conflict: Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong), Derek&#8217;s younger brother, idolizes Derek&#8217;s old days and racist ways, and is already following in his footsteps. Derek, freed of his hatred, sees it as his duty to rescue his sibling, before he has to learn the hard way. The resolution: a bitter-sweet success tinged with irony. <BR>        The story, from the aggressive start to the shocking, emotional ending, is powerful, universal, and timeless. But the movie is propelled to a whole other level with the outstanding performance of Edward Norton. Norton is able to evoke emotion without words, give meaning without saying a thing. For example, let&#8217;s examine the scene of Derek&#8217;s brutal crime. After getting all he can out of his automatic, Derek atrociously finishes off a survivor by kicking his skull into the curb. The following few minutes are pure film, with the exception of police commands in the background. Norton exemplifies the power, the glory Derek gains from his action, despite the actual horror, and the hopelessness of his crime. Derek&#8217;s bulging muscles, imposing swastika tattoo over his heart, demonic glare, and self-satisfied smile, overpower the fact that he is handcuffed and down on his knees. Norton, after embodying all that is evil, then, seemingly effortlessly, does a complete 180, and becomes the good guy. Norton&#8217;s portrayal is so powerful because he appears to literally become Derek, never once stepping out of character.<BR>        Along with Norton&#8217;s superb performance, the movie has multiple other noteworthy actors. Edward Furlong, although not nearly as strong an actor as Norton, is strong in the end, during Danny&#8217;s transformation. His voice cracks with emotion and his eyes brim with tears, as he effectively portrays Danny&#8217;s newly discovered innocense. <BR>        Of the smaller roles, Guy Torry, who plays Derek&#8217;s black friend in jail, and has much to do with his new mindset, gives a notable performance. Torry provides comedy, making the difficult plot a little easier to swallow.<BR>        But besides the outstanding acting and superb plot, there is also spectacular cinematography, which can be attributed to director and cinematographer Tony Kaye. Kaye uses black and white for flashback scenes and color for present-day scenes. Besides creating very aesthetically pleasing visuals through the constant switching of colors, the black and white and color scenes add a very distinct mood to the movie. The black and white, which depicts a very dark, gray past, stands for hopelessness. The color, thus, is used to create contrast, to stand for hope. The movie begins and ends with the same scene of the beach, the beginning in black and white, and the end in color. The color conveys a sense of optimism, despite the movie&#8217;s ironic twist of an ending.<BR>        The bleak theme, lined with glimmers of hope and optimism, parallels our world. American History X is a timeless movie, one that seemed all too appropriate when it first came out, not long after the death of Mathew Shepard, and one, that sadly, seems all too appropriate now, amidst the hatred and the war. But through all the horrid, gruesome scenery, the underlying message is hopeful: hate is taught, and it can be untaught. I will steal the ending lines of the movie, for as Danny says, someone has already said it best. \\"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, we must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\\" (Abraham Lincoln). <BR>        Hearing the centuries-old words of Abraham Lincoln through the emotional voice of a changed man, all set to the scene of a colorful sunrise&#8230;there isn&#8217;t much else left to say.
0783222475|5.0|when i first saw this movie, i was little and didn't understand much of it, but when i rented it from the library a few months ago, i fell in love with it, i immediately bought it and watched it over and over! God! this was such a great movie. if your lookin for a good action-packed thriller, rent this movie. trust me! YOU WILL LOVE IT!
6305949980|5.0|This movie has somthing for everyone. It is fantastic. It has music, dark comedy, wonderful visuals, a great score, bizarre chracters, and lots of imagination. This is by far one of the most imaginative films made in the last ten years. Tim Burton's ideas, along with Henry Selick's direction, and Danny Elfman' score, this movie became one of the best animated films ever made. Only Tim Burton could create something that is so equally chilling and childlike. the film may be too scary for very young children, but for kids seven on through ninety-seven, this is a treat for your senses. The extras are wonderful as well. Vincent is Tim Burton's directorial debut and it is fascinationg to see the influence of his work on this film. Like I said, only Tim can do this kind of work. His genius is equal parts David Lynch and Dr. Seuss. Disturbing and charming. He is a brilliant mind and this movie offers a rare showcase of that creativity. One of my all-time favorites and a pleasure from start to finish.
B00000IL1K|5.0|An otherwordly paradise-like affect, complete with a sitar, sets the stage for Eden, a worthy followup to Sarah's masterpiece, Time To Say Goodbye.<br />The three covers on this album are Hooverphonic's &quot;Eden&quot;, Kansas' &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; and Celine Dion's &quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot; only this song is sung in Italian as &quot;Il Mio Cuore Va&quot;, making it more exotic and intriguing.  It starts out in her pop voice before blooming in its full glory in her resonant operatic vocal at the emotionally climactic part of the song.<br />The medieval choir and Sarah's voice makes her rendition of &quot;Eden&quot; far superior than the original by Hooverphonic.<br />&quot;Bailero&quot; is an effective interlude that precedes the two other cover songs, which are back-to-back, by the way.  The same thing is achieved with &quot;Scene D'Amour&quot;, which bridges the emotionally potent &quot;Only An Ocean Away&quot; and &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;.  The crescendo that is reached when she sings the chorus is similar to the emotional climax in &quot;Il Mio Cuore Va&quot; but with lesser effect.<br />&quot;Deliver Me&quot; began life here before becoming such a theme in the movie Brokedown Palace.  More mainstream people who expect Eden or any of her other albums to be like &quot;Deliver Me&quot; had better have an appreciation of her opera voice.<br />The Richard Marx-penned &quot;The Last Words You Said&quot; closes the album and is a precious nugget wrapped around lush string arrangements.<br />Vocal styles:  Her lovely opera voice is put to great effect on &quot;Anytime, Anywhere&quot;, &quot;Il Mio Cuore Va&quot;, &quot;Nella Fantasia&quot;, &quot;Lascia Ch'io Pianga&quot;, and Puccini's &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;  Everything else is in her pop voice.<br />As on her post-Fly albums, an orchestra boosts her lovely vocals, and on Eden, it is the English National Orchestra.  While I place this below Time To Say Goodbye and La Luna, Eden still has its special place in paradise.l place in paradise.
B00000JCOV|5.0|this is by far one of the hardest, most downright MEAN cd's i've heard in a LONG time. whenever i need a kick in the butt, i just listen to this cd, and it gets me going. there need to be more bands like this, and get rid of the boy-bands!!!!!
B000007UA4|5.0|The team of Stock-Aitken-Waterman is replaced more in part by Stock-Waterman-Minogue on Let's Get To It.  The same snappy pop is there, but there's an emphasis on single-oriented material that doesn't sound have that &quot;hurriedly cranked out of the singles sausage-factory sound&quot;.  No, for her final go-around with the production team who put her on the map of fame, she breaks through even more than she did with Rhythm Of Love.<br />&quot;Word Is Out&quot; has her using a Full Force style chorus without going into Sam Fox's foray of hip-hop.  Brassy horns, bouncy synth percussions, and other instruments bounce this nice little number along.<br />Then comes one of three really big crown jewels.  Her cover of Chairman of the Board's &quot;Give Me Just A Little More Time&quot; with its brassy horn section is just what's needed to take the taste out of sour grapes from anyone's mouth.  Given the material of her last four albums, there's something to be said for saving<br />The lovely &quot;If You Were With Me Now&quot;, a duet with Keith Washington, is the best ballad she's ever done, and will stand in history as a perfect song for dear ones separated through great distances.  If the lush string section doesn't pull your heartstrings, it's time to get a new violin.<br />The other big ballad here, &quot;No World Without You&quot;, is more on the simplistic side, the only instrument being a guitar while Kylie does her thing.  The theme is identical to &quot;If You Were With Me Now&quot;<br />And now, best for last.  Old school techno fans will be on fire with &quot;I Guess I Like It Like That&quot;.  Sure, there were the rocket-paced songs on her first album, but this song leaves those in the dust.  &quot;Gotta keep it pumpin' it up cos I like it&quot;.  Programming &quot;Give Me Just A Little More Time&quot; and this song is a perfect tonic for boring office work short of blowing the workplace altogether.<br />All the other songs are worthy without being filler.  &quot;Right Here Right Now&quot;, &quot;Too Much Of A Good Thing&quot;, and &quot;Live And Learn&quot; serve as better-than-average transitions to the real gems on this album.<br />After this, Kylie would go into a transitional period before going back to her roots with Light Years.&quot;Right Here Right Now&quot;, &quot;Too Much Of A Good Thing&quot;, and &quot;Live And Learn&quot; serve as better-than-average transitions to the real gems on this album.<br />After this, Kylie would go into a transitional period before going back to her roots with Light Years.
B000001EL3|4.0|Para muchos crticos el mejor disco del Kiss.  No comparto mucho esa opinin, no es que sea un mal Cd de hecho no lo es.

0679731725|3.0|Ishiguro's Remains of the Day is a strong study in masterful characterization.  In the always professional Stevens, Ishiguro crafts a convincing character that serves as a strong instrument to convey the observations on the human condition that he wishes to expound. <br />Stevens gladly sacrifices his personal life (such as it is) in order to provide good service to Lord Darlington, and finds dignity and purpose in &quot;serving those great gentlemen at the hub of this world.&quot;  In his unstinting professionalism Stevens is oblivious to the overtures of Miss Kenton, Darlington Hall's housekeeper.  Ultimately, Stevens questions his loyalty to the perfidious Lord Darlington and regrets his decision to ignore Miss Kenton's romantic advances.<br />While the tone is rather gloomy up until the very end, Remains of the Day is actually and uplifting and reaffirming tale.  Stevens, while never breaking his buttoned-up professional character, realizes that he must make time for himself and forgive himself for allowing his personal affairs to fall into a state of desuetude.<br />Remains of the Day falls short in dealing with the other characters, none of which exhibit the strength and believability of Stevens.  The backward-looking narration style is effective in emphasizing Stevens's increasingly introspective nature, but Ishiguro is unable to build other strong characters to interact with Stevens.  Furthermore, the fact that Stevens has his epiphany with a stranger is a strong break in character, and proves to be an ineffective climax.  Overall, Ishiguro crafts a good, but not by any means great, read in Remains of the Day.
B000001EL7|4.0|De la poca ms fructifera del Kiss (los 70s).

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Absolutely one of the very best DVDs I have seen or heard. The animation is superb and the color saturation on this pressing is just great. The DTS encoded soundtrack is marvelous. And this just might be Eddie Murphy's best performance ever! Treat yourself, it sure beats Geraldo talking about Anthrax.
0141301104|5.0|This is one of AJ McLean(from the Backstreet Boys)'s favorite books as a child. I plan to read it, and from what I have heard, it's a very fun and imaginative book. The BSB are one of my fave groups and that sparked my interest. I'm 18 years old, and have always enjoyed childrens books, such as the more recent Harry Potter...so if you are a fan of kid's books or of the BSB, it is a worthwhile effort to pick up this book.
0783240503|5.0|I saw JOSEPH a couple years ago and loved it so much that my mother bought the video for me for Christmas, and i have to say the video is nearly as great as the live version.  I love EVERY single song.  Donny is FABULOUS as Joseph.  His voice is amazing and he is gorgeous.  I watch this movie all of the time.  I recommend if you love musicals to buy this.  It is worth every penny.

B00000ING2|4.0|I admit I didn't see this movie for years because of its strange title, but it kept appearing in various places. Finally, I put it on my \\"to watch\\" list and it was an enjoyable movie.<br />Waring Hudsucker, head of Hudsucker Industries, commits suicide, his board of directors, led by Sidney Mussberger, come up with a plan to make a lot of money and appoint a moron to run the company and drive down stock prices.<br />When the stock falls low enough, Sidney and co. plan to buy the stock for pennies on the dollar, take over the company, and restore its fortunes.<br />They select Norville Barnes, who has just started working in the mail room. Norville doesn't quite have the drive to avoid running the company into the ground. Reporter Amy Archer suspects something begins an undercover investigation of Hudsucker Industries.<br />If you're looking for a fun movie with odd twists and humor, you'll get it here. This was not as far out as \\"Fargo\\" or as gross as \\"Evil Dead\\" and viewers get the opportunity to see the Coen Brothers and Sam Raimi in action without the violence, blood, and gore. First thing I thought is that this reminded me of \\"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\\" and it is along those lines with the main character rising to the top right away rather than halfway through the show.<br />The movie does have flaws, but it doesn't prevent anyone from enjoying it.
B00005LMWI|5.0|Within the realms of metal, there are those who like great vibrato-vocal ridden melodies, blistering soulful Marty Friedman-esque guitar solos, and epic movie-like musical ambience complimenting the metal aggression of the power chord crunch. Kamelot deliver to us in spades, and can now be deemed as one of the best power metal groups in existence today.<br />Karma is an album you get once in a blue moon. From the moment you push play, you do not want to skip a single track, and in fact, it urges you to listen intently for the fear of missing out on some majestic piece of orchestration.<br />The album's opener, &quot;Regalis Apertura&quot;, an instrumental that, in my mind, takes you to some mythical Hyborean age of Conan or Braveheart, adjoins to &quot;Forever&quot; which, believe me, has the most intense melody hook that doesn't want to let go (and has you humming for hours on end). And it doesn't stop there - the entire set of 12 songs (not including &quot;Ne Pleure Pas&quot; since it is basically &quot;Don't you Cry&quot; in French) is a fantastic effort in a genre of music that needed this gulping breath of fresh air.<br />Cutting it very simply, if you can appreciate metal with melody, then this is the creme de la creme. Fans of Iron Maiden (Somewhere in Time/Seventh Son era), Yngwie Malmsteen (Eclipse/Fire&amp;Ice era), Marty Friedman (RIP/Scenes era), and epic movie soundtracks will love Kamelot.

B00005RHGK|1.0|[...]P>I got to see this for free, and I still wanted my money back plus restitution for wasting my time. The creature was not at all scary, it looked mostly like someone had raided \\"the Creature From the Black Lagoon\\" make-up trailer. The story is so un-amazingly clich`e. About a brother & sister driving home from college on spring break. (The actors were poorly selected to play siblings, because there was some obvious sexual chemistry going on.) They get run off the road by a big scary black truck with a big horn. They see the driver dumping a body down a sewer up the road. The brother decides to investigate and climb down a dirty rat infested pipe--c'mon who would really do this? He sees some horrifying things at the bottom of the pipe & the brother & sister go to a town full of braindead rubes and get stalked by a crazy psychic--who just happens to know the number of the payphone and the exact time they are standing in front of it. Some more chasing and bloody killings by the creature until a big shootout at the end...the creature gets away so that there's a possibility for a sequel--which I hope will never ever happen. [...]

B00005OAIE|5.0|Don't be turned away by the unjustifiable review given on this site, this is an incredible album.  John Mayer has a definite uncanny ability to construct poignant songs and masterfully handle his guitar.  The only negative aspect of this cd is the fact that there just don't seem to be enough guys out there like this young singer/songwriter.  (Oh, and about the Dave Matthews' comparison, give me a break!  Now I am not going to say anything about DMB, because I know that would only get me in trouble, but John Mayer is a totally different type of artist.)  So, yeah, give it a listen, it is really good!

6304539282|5.0|I always go back and forth between the Star Wars movies.  They're good, well-made movies, but I don't want to labeled as a &quot;Star Wars Freakzogeek&quot; so I tend to keep my distance.  If someone asks if I like Star Wars, what I do is say, &quot;Those are good movies, but have you seen The Matrix?!?!&quot; because that's like the cool movie right now, I guess.  And the amazing thing is, they're both VERY similiar! (Think about it!)<br />A New Hope was the first in the series (not really the FIRST, but let's not get that started), and it's a good movie.  I always feel sad when I see Mark Hamil.  I mean, here's a guy who never went beyond the Star Wars films and is probably out alone right now crying in a hotel room thinking about how big Harrison Ford got it and how low he sunk.  I think the last I heard he was doing a voice-over for some video game.  That's pretty bad. <br />The Empire Strikes Back was the next movie made, and it's probably the deepest (which means most people don't like it that much; the hosers).  Yoda is in it, the creep.  Sad ending in this one, because Harrison Ford gets frozen.  Of course, if Mark Hamil got frozen the audience would've stood up and cheered, the poor sap.<br />And now we come to Return of the Jedi, the last WELL-MADE Star Wars movie that's been released.  It basically three movies: you got the Jabba the Hut part where Carrie Fischer runs around half-naked; you got those horrible, little Ewok creatures that's a warning about how &quot;cute&quot; Episode One will be; and then you got the whole creepy Emperor, who's a real jerk and likes to zap people.  Darth Vader turns out to be a good guy (and NOT James Earle Jones; he's some bald, old, white guy!).  <br />The Phantom Menace is one of those Disney &quot;kids-are-smarter-than-adults&quot; films cleverly disguised as a Star Wars movie.  There are some pretty clever hair styles in here, so if you're a barber, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!  It'll give you some creative ideas. <br />Ifyou're a Star Wars nutso, you can see those boring Ewok movies (Ewok Adventure, Battle for Endor, etc.).  They're kinda creepy, like the Ewoks themselves.  I never really liked them that much; those movies gave me nightmares when I was a young 'un.

068484267X|4.0|I kind of hate writing these for fear that I will give away to much or to little of the story and ruin it for whoever is contemplating reading or purchasing this book.<BR> Angela's Ashes is a memoir of a young boy, Frank, growing in a poor family in Limerick, Ireland. <BR> I really enjoyed reading it, though parts of it had a habit of dragging in such a way that I had to put the book down for a while and allow my mind a break before I could get back into it.<BR> Many of the experiences throughout the story are ones you would find in any tale of growing up and discovery of ones self. The tales of extreme poverty and fear of death and diseases open up a new worlds that many of the readers have never faced, or haven't dealt with to such a full extent.<BR> That is why this book can a appeal to different age groups, from people who grew up during that time, to middle aged persons eager to do the trendy thing, or ready to learn more about extreme poverty. Or even to help them remember their own troubles and confusion while growing up.  It also can appeal to the teenager, ready for adventure, or learning more about themselves, their bodies, their oddities, and needing someone with whom to relate. <BR> If you reading this book review in order to nudge your opinion to buy or read it in one direction or another, then you probably should stop reading here. I want to tell my absolute favorite part. I'm not sure why I love it so much, except for it holds the same writing style that I sometimes write in, and that connects me to the book at a personal level.<BR> I absolutely love that part where he has been held back due to the time he spent in the hospital and is required to write a composition. Something about how his composition is written, with such blatant truth and such a humorous tone, I just love it. <BR> &quot;It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place Because if He was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and therewouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have learned about catechism and write compositions about Him.&quot;<BR> I think the reason I like this so much is because after the teacher and headmaster heard it, Frank got moved up to the correct class.<BR> All in all, this was an interesting read, and I would recommend it to most people. But I feel that, like with any book, some people may not see the true human feel it contains, and may only read the surface of it.

The adaptation, the script, the acting, the directing, the score, and the production are exemplary. <br />The DVD offers no extra features over the VHS version except the obvious technical quality, yet the standard of the film is such that it demands a copy in the DVD format, if only from a pride of ownership perspective. I already owned a copy on VHS when the DVD version was released, and didn't hesitate on buying it again on DVD for posterity.<br />Don't ever rent this film: BUY IT.<BR> <BR>It will become a joy to watch over and over again, each time bringing a new level of understanding, and returning ever more to the viewer.

Did we not get the memo about guitar players changing the world? Am I really supposed to be impressed by someone trying once again to use hard-edged rock music to breathe life into Marxism's abandoned corpse? How is this supposed to be the shape of punk to come when it covers the same lyrical territory that the Clash and Rancid have beaten to death?<br />\\"This Manifesto is very much for real.\\" No, it isn't. It's not even a manifesto. It's a CD. Manufactured and sold like any other. You too are part of the system. Deal.<br />Next point is the howling. I realize it's the new cool way to vocalize. No band would dare go hardcore these days without making sure the frontman puts a couple of tracks on plastic sounding like a buffalo with it's throat cut. And after a few listens, it gets distinctly less irritating. All the same, a little more actual singing on the album would make the screams actually seem to reflect a genuine emotional peak as opposed to \\"Gee, there's the rythmn riff, I better start shouting.\\"<br />That said, the music does rock. Skillful and varied playing, achieving both power and speed that impresses more and more with every play. If this becomes the kind of music that punk outfits play, I'll be pleased. Now if we can lose the \\"Look Mom, I'm a rebel\\" routine, all the bases will be covered. I mean, why should I plop down $ to listen to someone hearken back to the spirt of 1968 when for the same money I can have the MC5 take me there?
B00000K31V|1.0|It just does not get any worse than this movie.  Simple words cannot describe the nausa I feel every time I recall that awful day I was subjected to eXistenZ.  Perverted and grotesque, this movie embodies all that is wrong with modern cinema.  A knockoff of Matrix &amp; The Thirteenth Floor (a knockoff of a knockoff!) the only new feature this movie brought to the screen was mutant reptiles being disected for use in a gameboy.  Wow.
B00005N9CV|5.0|This is a marvelously seductive album, satin-smooth.  I've been slowly compiling a set of five discs which I can put on the player on a Sunday morning without having to think about it, and know that I'll have a worthwhile but non-intrusive listening experience.  So far, the rotation consists of:<BR>1)  The Look of Love (Diane Krall)<BR>2)  Sunday at the Village Vanguard (Bill Evans Trio)<BR>3)  Kind of Blue (Miles Davis)<BR>4)  Giant Steps (John Coltrane)<BR>Ms. Krall's vocals, like her piano playing, are tasteful and understated, sensuous and seductive.  The string arrangements are sensitive and moody, not syrupy.  S'wonderful!
B00000IPAX|1.0|It seems that just about everything is being called &quot;punk&quot; now. Apparently, if you play &quot;fast, hard&quot; music, that makes you punk in the media's eye. Well, sorry to break it to you all...blink182 is NOT punk. The Sex Pistols and the Clash were punk. The Dead Kennedys were punk. Bikini Kill was punk. All of those bands had integrity, and they were all angry about what was happening socially at the time. Blink182 is more concerned about telling sex jokes and getting laid. Yes, a lot of true punk-bands had songs about sex...but they were more than just that. Just because your music has a raw edge, that doesn't make you punk. If you're a 13-16 year old male poseur, then by all means, buy this album. Do not buy this album if you want true punk music. If you want REAL punk, buy an album by the Sex Pistols or the Clash, not this meaningless garbage.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This Album is The Best Album By Britney or any other artist in a LONG time. IF U DID NOT LIKE SLAVE u still WILL like this album.<br />Best Songs:<BR>Lonley<BR>What It's Like To Be Me <BR>I Love Rock &amp; Roll<BR>I'm Not A Girl, Yet Not A Women (should have named it Not A Girl)<BR>OverProtected<br />Worst Song:<BR>Anticipating (i mean its REALLY REALLY bad)<BR>I think that track should have been:<BR>What's Going On<BR>Before The Goodbye<BR>Intimidated OR<BR>She'll Never Be Me<BR>ALL of which u can find on her fan websites <br />(N-Tense.Net has it i think)
B00005OM4N|5.0|One word - Brilliant!  Britney's really proven herself again with her 3rd album.  &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; is probably one of the weaker tracks on the album, so don't be put off - it's more grown up than &quot;Oops...&quot;, while still being the classic catchy Britney stuff!  It's full of future hits - &quot;Overprotected&quot; and &quot;I'm Not A woman...&quot; 2 of the best.  Enjoy!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Okay, Waters' Floyd, Gilmour's Floyd, (and for you purists) Barret's Floyd; this collection is worth a visit.  Splendid blending of old and new and forgotten Floyd tunes, these CD's have managed to gather the musical likings and personal favorites from the entire core of Pink Floyd members (yes, even Waters) and magically assemble each final, chosen work into an almost seemless opus.  Original studio recordings were used to get around cross fading, and each song runs like water (no pun intended) into the next.  Even the few tracks from that Other Band don't take away from this collection (I have my own reservations, not to alienate here).  They are fantastic works of music that share much treasured space with the classics.  <BR>As for those &quot;classics&quot; selected, only two thoughts: &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot; is finally available on CD, and &quot;Echoes&quot; is edited.  Not sure about the latter, but it does work.  Hats off to James Guthrie for putting together such a fine collection, superseeding the seamingly countless other &quot;greatest hits.&quot;  Very good indeed.  Don't let the mad buggers get you down, this is a gem...<br />Buy it.
B000002NHN|5.0|In this remarkable album, LM continues her journey from traditional Irish-Celtic melodies toward distinct, hypnotic works richly layered with Middle Eastern and European sounds. (The variety of instruments listed in the liner notes is staggering--who but LM could integrate the harp, kanoun, cello, bodrahn, tin whistle, shawm, etc.? What is a shawm, anyway?) Through it all, though, McKennitt's hauntingly angelic voice guides, caresses and inspires, whether portraying a dying monk in &quot;Skellig&quot; or the Italian poet in &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; or narrating Alfred Noyes' dark, engaging ballad &quot;The Highwayman&quot; for ten minutes of stark, vivid storytelling.<br />Each of the three instrumental tracks--&quot;Prologue,&quot; &quot;Marco Polo&quot; and &quot;La Serenissima&quot;--is beautiful and captivating in its own right.  The hypnotic &quot;Prologue&quot; sets the mood for the entire album, with LM's voice emerging mid-way through to complete the enchantment.  The exotic &quot;Marco Polo&quot; has its own magic: you have to move, however slightly, while it plays.  Finally, the languid, violin-borne &quot;La Serenissima&quot; delicately evokes the spirit of Renaissance-era Venice: distant music over torch-lit waters.<br />There is no mediocre track present here. That said, the most splendid is the last, &quot;Dante's Prayer.&quot; Following the breathtaking voices of the St. Petersburg Chamber Choir, LM's own rises, tender and pleading and pure: &quot;Cast your eyes to the ocean, cast your soul to the sea. When the dark night seems endless, please remember me.&quot; I do not know that there is a more beautiful song in my entire collection.<br />Like most, if not all of her albums, this is best appreciated at night, perhaps with wine and candlelight and thoughts turning to far-away worlds, heaven among them. As in her previous album, &quot;The Mask &amp; The Mirror,&quot; LM writes lyrics of deep spiritual longing, here heightened by the allegory of travel. (She sings in &quot;Skellig&quot; of &quot;rivers running deep, beneath an endless sky&quot;--and they appear.)<br />If civilization endures, justice demands that these songs endure also.  I believe they are timeless.  Certainly, the essence of timelessness pervades them.  I give this album my very highest endorsement and await her next, not quite daring to hope that it can surpass The Book of Secrets.ravel.

0451450523|5.0|This is a fairytale I plan to have on the nightstand, waiting to be read to my children. Its a beautiful lyrical tale, something you can read over and over again just for the poetic enjoyment. In only 200 pages, Beagle's characters ring so true. Most writers fail to manage that in twice the length! After countless years of solitude (unicorns live alone), the unicorn cannnot remember when she saw another of her kind. She fears that she may be the last one. She runs into a fumbling low-rate Magician. Together they travel through a forest where Merrymen worship Robinhood and travel to the castle by the sea in search for another of her kind. From the first sentence to the last, you'll be gifted with such lush and surreal beauty and vivid characters. I loved it!<br />It ranks in the league of The Hobbit as not only a children's story, but a timeless tale for all ages.
B000056N8X|5.0|Even though I have yet to see HIGHLANDER II: THE QUICKENING and HIGHLANDER: THE FINAL DIMENSION, this film is just as good as the original film. Jacob Kell is on par with The Kurgan as the best villians that Connor and Duncan Macleod have ever faced. The visual effects were done very good (compared to the series). The acting and choreography are done very well. If this film has any downfalls, there would be two of them:<br />1) DUNCAN AND FAITH'S SEX SCENE. True, it has good editing between the scene in the past and the present, and the woman playing Faith is great looking. But I'd rather watch Kate Winslet's nude scene in TITANIC than look at Adrian Paul's naked rear end through half of that scene. And since I'm a Christian, I really shouldn't watch this scene much at all.<br />2) THE DEATH OF CONNER MACLEOD. This is the part of the movie that bothered me the most. Conner is my favorite HIGHLANDER character, and was THE ONE in the original film. It was sad tha he died, but it was more sad that Duncan was the one that killed him. Even though it was inevitable, it's still sad to think about.<br />Other than these minor problems, HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME is a movie that all HIGHLANDER fans shouldn't be without. Grade: A+
B00005OM4N|5.0|&quot;Baby One More Time&quot; and &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot; were both incredible albums and after a string of hits, raunchy performances, engaging videos and making a film, Britney is back and has brought her best material with her.<br />&quot;Britney&quot; may not instantly hit her younger audiences as quickly as the material is definitely more mature, although she still has produced a series of sexy pop songs that are certainly keeping a hint of Oops's winning formula.<br />(1) I'M A SLAVE 4 U - No doubt we've heard this sexy and breathy slice of pop that certainly changes Spears's style, and whilst one of the standout tunes on the album, this type of sound isn't the basis of the album.<br />(2) OVERPROTECTED - One of the future singles, this is a more familiar Britney sound and she funks things up a little in this destined to be a pop classic.  Has a little *Nsync feel to it.<br />(3) LONELY - One of the tracks Spears co-wrote, this is a sexy, aggressive R&amp;B based pop tune that has one hell of a catchy chorus and proves how much of a credible writer she is.  Definitely a must listen to song.<br />(4) NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN - The album's signature ballad, and theme song to her upcoming film &quot;Crossroads&quot;, is this goregeous number co-written by Max Martin and UK singer Dido.  Spears' voice sounds incredible and is tipped to be the second single released.  <br />(5) BOYS - Said to be one of Britney's personal faves, this takes a few listens to get used to.  Produced by The Neptunes, who also did &quot;Slave 4 U&quot;, it features more of Britney's breathy vocals.  Defintitely a different kind of song.<br />(6) ANTICIPATING - Another one of Britney's writing efforts is this cute Janet Jackson style, early Kylie sounding, pop tune that is pure fun to listen to.  Shows she hasn;t lost her pop roots completely.<br />(7) I LOVE ROCK &quot;N&quot; ROLL - Hit R&amp;B writer/producer Rodney Jerkins (Jennifer Lopez, Destiny's Child, Brandy) teams uponce again with Spears for the cover of this classic rock track.  Whilst their last collaboration funked up the Stones' &quot;I Cant Get No Satisfaction&quot;, this time around they are staying very much close to the original content and Spears' voice suits it perfectly.  This standout tune will also be featured in her film &quot;Crossroads&quot;<br />(8) CINDERELLA - Another Britney writing effort is this fast paced pop tune, that keeps the pride of &quot;Oops&quot; alive.  Funky track.<br />(9) LET ME BE - Urban style pop tune is a standout.  Spears co-wrote this funky, and short, pop track that highlights the change of direction to a more R&amp;B setting.  Is also featured on the soundtrack to &quot;On The Line&quot;.<br />(10) BOMBASTIC LOVE - Not a duet with Shaggy and not a hint of reggae pop anyway.  This is another urban style pop tune that is instantly likeable, has a catchy chorus and a bit of a Pink feel to it.<br />(11) THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME - Cute, catchy pop track mixes balladry and dance.  Her voice is so cute and this is another instantly likeable tune that should appeal to her younger audiences.<br />(12) WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME -  Co-written by Britney's choreographer Wade Robson and NSync front member Justin Timberlake, this was a highly anticipated track that lives up to it's expectations.  Agressive vocals over a funky backbeat, and Timberlake's beatbox, make this a potential hit and album standout.  Timberlake also provides backing vocals.<br />The Australian version I am reviewing also features two extra tracks.  WHEN I FOUND YOU - A sweet ballad whcih will no doubt appeal to younger listeners and BEFORE THE GOODBYE - The anticipated BT produced track that was intended to be on the US release.  The tune crosses many music genres from balladry to pop, a slice of R&amp;B and even upbeat dance.<br />Overall this is Britney's best work yet, and this album will no doubt carry her success, and all that talk of wanting a mature style and sound hascome through on what is sure to be the album of the year
B000001FA4|5.0|The musical beauty in this album, particularly &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot; and &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and &quot;Bad,&quot; is unsurpassed. It doesn't get old, just more delicious as it is listened to repeatedly.
0195067142|5.0|Dr. Sledge wrote that in the slaughtering days of Peleliu there was no sound -- no sound because there was ALL sound, deafening assaults on the ear's physiology.  Of the 9000 Marines who landed on the island's shores, 1 out 7 were dead within 24 hours.  Ocean water was dyed red to 4 feet out.  On shore, and weighted down with 90 pounds of survival gear and weaponry, men ran and fired and fought in 110-degree heat, with no water to drink.  And that was only the beginning.<br />Accounts of organized slaughter abound, from Thucydides' &quot;History of the Peloponnesian Wars&quot; to the Civil War's &quot;Andersonville,&quot; from Leon Uris's factual writings shaped as novels to Canada's Farley Mowat in his 40-years-after-the-war eloquent memoir &quot;And No Birds Sang,&quot; and to Larry Heinemann's wrenching exposures of Viet Nam.  All these writings are unspeakably moving, and when we close the covers, we think we understand ... until we come across a book like that of E.B. Sledge.<br />The accounts of Dr. Sledge touched me immeasurably of their own accord but also because I once loved a casualty of that South Pacific island's horrors, who, unfortunately, never quite found a way back to normalcy.  I was too young and self-involved to comprehend.  As he continued his fateful journey into alcoholism, my own soul stiffened and I left that tortured man.<br />Twenty-six years later I sought out Dr. Sledge, and after some time found a way to reach him.  His words, in a letter to me, ought to be shared.  Dr. Sledge wrote that his physician father offered advice that put Sledge \\"on the road to a postwar life of happiness and success.\\"  Some of the advice was this:  \\"Don't ever feel bitter or sorry for yourself.  You served your time in Hell, but you survived.\\"<br />Survive he did, and well.  Dr. Sledge went on to earn degrees in science and to become \\"Uncle Eugene\\" to his friends on the Alabama campus where he taught biochemistry and zoology.  &quot;Science was my salvation,&quot; he told me. &quot;When combat memories bore down on me I lost myself in a difficult problem [in science].\\"<br />Read his noble book.  In honoring him, we honor all who have served, and are now serving, the ideals of our country.&quot; he told me. &quot;When combat memories bore down on me I lost myself in a difficult problem [in science].\\"<br />Read his noble book.  In honoring him, we honor all who have served, and are now serving, the ideals of our country.
B000001F3C|4.0|&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; is one of my favorite songs, because of the following lines:<br />&quot;And it's true we are immune<BR>When fact is fiction and T.V. reality<BR>And today the millions cry<BR>We eat and drink while tomorrow they die&quot;<br />Similarly, &quot;New Year's Day&quot;:<br />&quot;Under a blood red sky<BR>The crowd is gathered--black and white<BR>Arms entwined--the chosen few--<BR>Newspaper says--says--say it's true, it's true<BR>We can break through<BR>Though torn in two<BR>We can be one&quot;<br />This album takes the worst of the world's problems, treats them honestly and openly, and then provides hope for a better future. It is an album for the idealist, one that comforts the disturbed and disturbs the comfortable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the whole album isn't quite as coherent as the individual songs.
B00003CXTF|3.0|The cinematography in this film is excellent, the long battle scene displaying the best in modern computer-generated technology.  Somewhere, however, there is a good story line, characters to care about and a way to feel the mounting tension that existed in 1941 when the U.S.A. was on the brink of war.  I know there is because I felt it all in the much more unsophisticated technically 1953 film  From Here to Eternity actually shot in black and white.  Somewhere there is a good film about General Doolittle's raid on the Japanese mainland, which changed the direction of the war; that's Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo, produced in 1944.  And somewhere is a film using modern film techniques, which also captures the essence of a great a sorrowful tragedy; I felt this in the film Titanic.<br />O.K. - so with all the media hype and some wonderful films which set an example for the producers, they DID have a rough act to follow.  But give me a break!  They had $135 million to work with and the most technologically advanced equipment that money can buy.  So why, oh why is this film such a loser?<br />(1)  This is easily one of the most inane love stories I've ever seen.  Most romantic comedies have better plot, and so do daytime TV soap operas.  Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale were burdened with this silly tale of the arrogant fighter pilot who meets the nurse while taking an eye test.  He can't read his letters because he gets them confused and she is about to flunk him but he makes a pitch to her about why that won't affect his ability to fly.  She feels sorry for him and passes him.  Of course, later, he has no trouble writing or reading love letters but by that time nobody cares.  The rest of the plot is equally silly.  I never got involved with the characters, never cared on whit about their silly romance and found myself giggling at their dialog.<br />(2)  The history was much too general.  I yearned for more facts, more details of what was going on at the time.  There is one dramatic scene where President Roosevelt inspires his cabinet by forcing himself to walk without crutches but I understand that this never happened.  Which makes me think why the author made something up when there were so many real life known experiences that were equally, if not more dramatic. Also, There is absolutely no depiction of why the war happened in the first place, except for some vague remark by the Japanese commander that we had cut off their way to get oil and they had just enough left for 18 months.  Perhaps the writer thought that the need for oil was the only thing that a modern audience could relate to, which insults everyone's intelligence.<br />(3)  The battle scene was indeed spectacular and lasted for a full 40 minutes on screen.  Some of the images where upsetting, but I thought more about the technical effects than I did about the devastation.  Again, it was much too general.  I wanted to be more aware about the strategies and about the different ships.<br />(4)  Cuba Gooding Jr. is a good actor; his performance shone in Men of Honor.  His very tiny role as the African-American cook who won distinction for firing on the Japanese during the attack, was good, but I couldn't help thinking about the difference between the two films and how lacking in inspiration Pearl Harbor was.<br />(5)  The best part of the film was the last few minutes, when Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle commanded the raid over Tokyo.  Finally, I felt sense of battle; finally, I got involved in the movie.  Alas, though, it was over too soon.<br />To its credit, I must say I wasn't bored.  The scenes moved quickly, almost too quickly in some parts. As we all knew the attack was coming, it needed more tension.  And too much time was spent on the silly love story.  But as either a great film or a memorial to the Americans who lost their lives that fateful day, it was sorely lacking.time.

B00005QG9J|4.0|when i first bought Make Yourself i had no idea what to expect from Incubus and then i listened to it and the gentle, poetic, yet somehow destructively consuming melodies sank into my brain and i couldn't get the songs out of my head (this is a good thing)! When Morning View came out, the anticipation grew and grew until decided i should buy it before i go insane. i put it in and it has a much more matured sound than Make Yourself. it seems Incubus wasn't afraid to venture into soft melodies on this album. although there's a lot of beautifully structured songs on Morning View, there's always those pounding, guitar shredding songs to prevent any monotony, like Blood On The Ground and Under My Umbrella (classic Incubus songs)<BR>other great songs include: Mexico, Wish You Were Here, Warning, and 11am. Incubus may have experimented a little more on this album, but they definately haven't sold out as some of u have been complaining. They just aren't afraid to be different. Buy this album you won't regret it!!!
0743420373|4.0|The implication that authors Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D. and William D. Danko, Ph.D. make in The Millionaire Next Door is that anybody with a stable job can become wealthy. Dr. Stanley and Dr. Danko interviewed millionaires (that is people that have a net worth of a million dollars or more- to find out what their lifestyles are like and to see it they play any particular role in their amassing millions of dollars. When reading more into the book the image of the affluent as flaunting their possessions is distorted. One thing that will come as a shock to anyone that reads this book is when one finds out about the number one factor that most of the millionaires interviewed described, as a major reason for being rich. Real millionaires tend to live well under their means. People (such as celebrities or any other high paying profession) that make a good amount of money are not considered rich unless their net worth is a million dollars or more. The media has blinded many into believing that the more possessions one has the more affluent one looks, not is. This particular book is a good read. Although it is long it is very interesting because it gives facts that one might have not even known. I truly recommend this book to anyone that is self-disciplined and that will read the book with an open-mind. Keep in mind that these people are first-generation rich, this means they were once like us. If they made it so can we!
0451169514|5.0|IT by Stephen King<br />In Stephen King's IT, seven people recount their childhoods and their own encounters of fear and horror.  In the book, IT is an evil with no name, who represents different things for each character.  IT is portrayed as a clown that appears to each character in different situations.  First, King uses third person omniscient  point of view to show the reader the characters' situations through the eyes of another character.  Moreover, King uses the symbol of the clown to represent the life experiences of each character and to represent fear and horror in each situation. Furthermore, King employs flashbacks into the story to demonstrate how each event took place, and how the feelings of each character grow from the time they were children. King includes many devices of literature to show how life experiences and feelings of children can grow, and how evil can come in many forms for each person.<BR>First, Stephen King uses third person omniscient point of view to show the reader how events are related through the eyes of another character.  In this case, a police officer gives his own account of the murders that occurred in the summer of 1958 in the town of Derry, Maine.  His recollection of these events included the murder of Georgie Hanscom, Ben Hanscom's brother, who was found dead in a sewer drain.  He remembers the town's response to this mysterious murder, and other murders, that occurred in 1958.  He remembers how no one could ever figure out how these things could happen is such a safe, small town.  This police officer continues to give his own thoughts about the characters' developments, as well his own accounts of the murders.<BR>Second, King uses the symbol of the clown, referred to as IT, as an evil force in the story.  For each character, IT means something different, and represents some kind of fear that is going on internally within each character.  For instance, Beverley Marsh's father continuously beats her, and every time he does, the clown appears.  Another example is Richie is constantly bullied, and when his bullies show up, the clown is always there laughing at him.  The clown in the story does not only represent horror, but fear for each character and their own experiences. King displays this by showing that evil can come in many forms, and fear is always something different for everyone. <BR>Third, King uses the device of flashback to show how people and past events are related.  In the beginning of the story, each adult-version of their character remembers the horrific events and murders that happened in their small town.  Again, even as adults, they encounter IT through flashbacks.  They remember specific events and can piece together a \\"puzzle\\" that has haunted them since they were children.  They remember the murders of their friend's siblings and even their own friends.  In doing this, King shows the reader the fear that goes on in each character's mind, and shows how events fit together, from the past to the present.  King shows each character's feelings and remembrances through the device of flashback.<BR>    <br />Clearly, King writes to show how fear can come in many forms, and he uses literary devices to show this.  King uses third person omniscient point of view to show how events are seen through  the eyes of another character.  Second, King uses IT to symbolize fear and how it is different for every person.  He also uses the device of flashback to show the reader internal conflicts with the character, and how events are related.  King employs these devices well and puts them in the book so that the story makes sense. It is a very compelling, interesting, and well-written novel.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I have to say that this movie was wonderful, it's worth to buy.It's not like the cartoon but then again I'm glad, if I wanted the cartoon version I would have gotten it.Jim Carrey does a wonderful job, no one else would have acted better.I definetly would not pass this up to buy, it's going to go fast!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Even though I am a bigger fan of `A Band of Gypsy's' this album still impresses me a lot.  In my view the best song by far is `Freedom' due to its clever arrangement and the melody.  `Voodoo Chile' never seizes to amaze any guitarist I have met, though Jimi said himself it was just a jam it sounds so perfect and so right its hard to tell.  Every song is a classic and I recommend every one to buy this album it'll be the best money you've spent this year on a CD.
B00005LMBK|4.0|It was pretty obvious when I heard Clint Eastwood that there were going to be three camps with this band. 1) Those who accept it as strong expermental CD full of ideas. 2) Clint Eastwood is the only good song and the rest of the CD sucks. And 3) Those who just plain hate Gorillaz and hate the CD entirely. I fall into catagory #1. I think this is the most unique concept album I have heard in awhile.<br />Gorillaz is easily described as laid back groove with an assortment of other varied ingretients. The end result is a lot of experimentation with different results. Sometimes is works overwelmingly well(Clint Eastwood of course, 5/4[that number is the time signature for the song for those who didn't realize this.], Tomorrow Comes Today, Double bass), sometimes okay, and sometimes just too bizarre(the latter part of the CD past 19/2000 is okay but not as great as the begining songs). The bulk of the CD is good, so I'm happy to say, yes its still worth your time and money. The instrumentation is great. Everything flows together incredibly well its easy to slip into a song and start visualizing the songs themselves(which is part of the fun of the CD. No, narcotics are not nescessary). The only fault I have with this CD is that sometimes it gets too heavy with experimentation and some of the ideas feel a little incomplete.<br />But not even a few filler tracks can stop a otherwise compelling debut from one of the most creative bands this year. Whether or not we will see anything else from this &quot;cartoon band&quot; is up for grabs, but the with entertainment value of most of this CD, its a pretty good ride. Recommended to those who want a little something different from there music, or just want something a little more mellow.
B00005OM4N|5.0|For not being a fan of Britney, I was very surprised with her new album &quot;Britney&quot;.  It obviously started off with the first single &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, which I think is one of the most diverse songs she has ever done.  It is followed by &quot;Overprotected&quot;, which, when one starts to listen to it, sounds like too much of a pop song, but then transforms into a funky beat with a brief rap, grabbing your attention.  The best songs on the album have to be &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, &quot;Lonely&quot;, &quot;Let Me Be&quot;, and &quot;Boys&quot;.  This album is worth the money, and, in my opinion, one of the best albums of the year.  It is basically aimed at older, more mature people, so that they would be invited to enjoy Britney, but also to keep her old fans as well.  5 stars; a much better effort than her past two albums!
B00005OM4N|5.0|the material that is used on Britney is the best Britney Spears has to offer thus far. This album is a lot better than Oops!  I Did It Again and ...baby one more time.  <BR> <BR>1. I'm A Slave 4 U - This song is a very good start to show Britney's growth as an artist.  It is defintley not a ...baby one more time part III, that oops! i did it again was.  It has a nice urban beat and takes a while to get used to.<BR> <BR>2. Overprotected -  Most likely the third single from Britney.  This is a pretty good song, in the vein of Stronger.  This is old school Britney.<BR> <BR>3. Lonely - Another good track from Ms. Spears.  It has the signature Rodney jerkin's beat... very reminiscent of Janet's what about with the same hard guitars. <BR> <BR>4. I'm Not A Girl... - The lone ballad on the cd.  The second single from Britney and the theme song to her movie that comes out in February.  She sticks to her limited range and really does a wonderful job at this song.  Her live performances of it have been a lot better than her performances of  &quot;Don't Let me Be the Last To Know&quot;<BR> <BR>5. Boys - Another nice R&amp;Bish song from the producers of I'm A Slave 4 U.  She really overdoes it a little with the sexual tones and voices, but its a nice song to dance to at the clubs.<BR> <BR>6. Anticipating - A very well crafted POP song.  This song oozes with sugary pop.  You'll just want to get up and dance to this song.<BR> <BR>7.  I Love Rock-N-Roll - Okay, this is like the only track I am not feelin' from this cd.  It is so out there and non Britney, maybe I will grow to love it, but i have been listening to it for a while and it does nothing for me.<BR> <BR>8. Cinderella - This is a filler song, very old school Britney.  Could have been found on either of her previous albums.<BR> <BR>9. Let Me be - Very good song, Rodney Jerkin's produced.  I wish it were longer.<BR> <BR>10. Bombastic Love - hmm, this song has really goofy lyrics, an okay attempt at a R&amp;Bish song.<BR> <BR>11. That's Where You Take me - I think this is Brit's attempt at two step, its okay, the lyrics are simple... but its a pretty song<BR> <BR>12. What It's Like To Be Me - This is the Justin Timberlake/Wade Robson ditty.  It's very good with beat box and all.  Britney sounds wonderful on this track. <BR> <BR>Overall this is a great album and very worthy of purchasing.  The European and Asian version contain bonus tracks.  Before the Goodbye and When I Found You are really good songs that should have been on the US album, but were sadly left out.  If you can find them, buy them!
6301543408|4.0|I know my rating and my title are contradictory, but anyways...<br />I'll start with saying that I had to see this movie 3 times at 2 year intervals before I could bring myself to watch it again.  I watched it for the third time ever about 2 months ago, then I saw it again, then again, then again...  Every time I saw it, I did notice that some very cheaply fabricated character dialogue stained this movie bad.  One of the particular instances that come to mind is this once-ever tryst between Scotty and Uhura, which comes off as two old fogies fooling around in off hours.  Eww.  Another bad element in this movie is the special effects. DUH.  I will definitely not have any protest to the fact that this movie has the absolutely worst special effects in the whole movie series.  Completely redoing the VFX alone would bring the average opinion of this movie up from 25%-ish to 70%+.  Most ppl are unaware of the fact that the bad special effects almost completely give the movie a very cheesy atmosphere.  Some of the movies strong points, however are as follows:  The best soundtrack in the series, with the soundtrack in Star Trek: The Motion Picture (incidentally, done by the same guy) following in second, an EXTREMELY heart touching scene that is second only to Spock's Death in ST2, and a general principle that reflects the old series, rather than Bill Shatner trying to ego his way into directorhood by screwing with the format.  I plan to start a petition pending seeing the anticipated &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture - Director's Edition&quot; to the people at Paramount or whoever myself and others deem capable of starting a similar project; We want them to re-work this movie.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Stuck between adolescence and womanhood, Britney executes by far one of her most consistent albums to date.  I found myself skipping less tracks and admiring her for taking a risk in exploring her own taste in music.  This album is far more personal and less contrived.  The worst song was strangely by the duo Max MArtin/Rami (ie &quot;not a girl, not yet a woman&quot;).  BRitney should be praised that she doesn't go crazy over ballads in part by her very thin/nasal vocals.  I believe there was only one which was just mentioned.  The Neptunes and Rodney Jerkins contributed to the standouts...ie, &quot;slave&quot; &quot;boys&quot; &quot;lonely&quot; &quot;i love rock n roll&quot; and &quot;let me be.&quot;  NOt all the swedish songs are ops...i did it again/strongerish......  Cinderealla, overprotected, and bombastic love are darker in theme, but none have the star quality of ops..i did it again.  Britney is certainly outgrowing her swedish producers faster than they would like to believe.  who would have guessed?  Overall, this is an impressive peice of work by someone with such vocal limitations.  Not unlike nsync, this is her one step closer to crossing genres.  &quot;Boys,&quot; a title seemingly contradicting her maturity, is THE definitive Britney song.  We hear her chant boys over layers of vocal arrangements, making this her most seductive production yet.  If she plans to make that step and release it as a single, she will definietly silence her critics and enliven her tenure in pop culture.
0792153189|3.0|&quot;Deep Impact&quot; opens with a scene of a group of people, on a hill in the country, observing the stars with their own, inexpensive telescopes. They are guided in their viewing, by a man who appears to be a local science teacher. Elijah Wood, who was around 14 when this film was shot, sees something in the sky that is... new. The science teacher, and the girl next door (Leelee Sobieski) try to convince him that it's nothing unusual, but he sticks to his guns. He knows the sky (or at least that one constellation he's looking at) well enough to be fairly sure that what he sees is not listed in the &quot;Peterson First Guide to Astronomy.&quot; (Incidentally, that's really saying something -- the Peterson Guide is fantastic.) The science teacher says &quot;well, all righty then,&quot; sends the coordinates of the sighting to a national observatory in Tucson Arizona, and -- sure enough, it's Doomsday.<br />The movie, after this point, shuttles back and forth between showing Elijah Wood and his family preparing at home; Morgan Freeman as the ideal, dignified, crisis-managing U.S. President (seriously, I'd vote for him in a heartbeat); Tea Leoni as the news reporter whose parents have just split up; and Robert Duvall as the elder astronaut leading a mission to nuke the bejiminy out of the incoming asteroid, out in space. The movie focuses very heavily on schmaltzy, emotional human drama, and only sporadically makes you think about the stark reality supposedly being portrayed here. This is the only reason I give this movie three stars. If I were one of the producers, I would have made sure to sieze the opportunity provided by this film to at least include a 5 minute documentary at the end, or an interview with Carl Sagan, stressing how real this threat is... Did you know that an event approximately like this is certain to happen someday? Ask any scientist. ***It may very well be THOUSANDS of years before it happens, thank God.*** But then again, it could happen... significantly sooner than that. We simply don't know. The next sizeable asteroid to hit us might not be a behemoth of an asteroid, like the one portrayed in this movie. As a matter of fact, we can say with total confidence that our planet will definitely be hit over and over and over, by asteroids of all shapes and sizes, for as long as our solar system exists. And even one that was &quot;only&quot; one tenth the size of the one in this film could do some serious damage... Think of how bad things could get if gigantic tsunamis simultaneously completely destroyed Washington D.C., New York, London, Boston, Rome, Jerusalem, Cairo, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Calcutta, Jakarta, Melbourne, Los Angeles, Rio de Janeiro, Miami, and coasts all over the world, all within a few hours.<br />The real heroes in this movie are not the astronauts, not the hard-hitting reporters -- not even Morgan Freeman, as much as it hurts to admit it. No, the real heroes in this movie are the ordinary people in the scene right at the beginning, who gather together in informal amateur astronomy clubs, to help keep an eye on the ever-brooding heavens. I recommend seeing this movie... <br />Anyway, there are a lot of fantastic dramatic performances in this movie, but it should have been a lot less schmaltzy. It's just inappropriate. This film happens to be science fiction today, thank God -- but it won't be that way forever. Science, and the laws of probability, unconditionally guarantee it. One thumb up.
0783226063|3.0|I've had my VHS tape of Dune practically forever, and when I saw it on the shelf in DVD, I immediately bought it thinking maybe some more footage, or at least the same footage that's on my tape. After watching the movie for a bit I was noticing that DVD version was missing scenes out from the film. The VHS version of Dune I had bought some years back was true to the film, the DVD version has chopped off scenes left and right. Still a good film (Dune always is..) but due to scenes being removed from the DVD version, I would recommend the VHS version.
1565846117|4.0|Like several other readers I read the German version of this novel because a woman recommended it to my wife as giving beautiful descriptions of Swedish landscape. We know the highways around Ystad, Malm&ouml; and Helsingborg, but the book did not give me much flavor of Swedish geography. I found the beginning painfully slow, living only in Wallander's mind with too much repetition of his thoughts. At some point the story became gripping but by page 273 I hadn't understood the connnections between the murdered girl and the murdered men (good point for the book, or negative point for the reader..??). The ending was pretty weak though. Also, how was it with Baiba on the vacation near Skagen? Will I read another Wallander mystery? Not clear.<br />Update. The appeal of the interest in sociology of Commisar Wallender won me over. Am reading Brannvegg in Norwegian transl., fantastic from the start, maybe Inspector Wallender/Mankell at his best! Comes out in English...as 'Firewall'. Was near Ystad (Sandhammaren) while reading it this month, good place to read Mankell!.
B00004TDRD|5.0|This movie is great.When I first saw this movie(about 5 years ago)it made me stay away from the water for months.The way the shark looked was so awesome and real!!Just think this movie was made in the 70's but it looks so real!!just think...they didint have computers to make affects or anything like that but they still pulled through and had made a very  real looking life like killer shark.The charecters are great and have lots and lots of depth.Its realy thrilling to and has lots of scares and action.It has a pretty high body count and its not that gory but its still cool to watch after jaws draggs his victims down into the cold abbyis and then you see all this blood cloud over the water.The most thrilling part id say is at the end when the ship is sinking and the main charecter is up on the sail and has to figure out a way to kill jaws before the boat completely sinks and he becomes a meal for the killer shark!!!!Very suspencful.There are also alot of other scens that was very thrilling but none as much as the final showdown between the main charecter and the killer shark,I dont wanto tell you any more but you have probly already seen it mainly because its been around forever.Buy this movie and also get jaws 2 but pass up jaws 3 and 4,they are just an embaresment to the brilliance of the first 2 jaws movies.
B000001FS3|5.0|Joshua tree is U2's best CD! It has songs like &quot;Pride&quot;, Still haven't found what im looking for&quot; and &quot;Red Hill Mining Town&quot;<BR>  Definitly worth 5 stars...
B00005QDW5|4.0|pink floyd's Best of album is a must have.  the album includes songs from every album, except atom heart mother, which is understandable, since the band has so many great songs. the art work alone on this album, by storm thorgerson, is worth the cost. the album is great, for an old fan, or a first time listener. echoes best of... is a great buy.<br />obscured by floyd
0345451325|5.0|This book has sucked me in, I can't put it down.  If the thought of the game entices you, you should read this book to give you the more complete sensation when playing the game.<br />The book tells of how the SPARTANS were picked, trained, and &quot;augmented,&quot; as well as their missions BEFORE getting to Halo.
B00005QDW5|4.0|this album is great, a must for any floyd fan.  it includes stuff from most albums, and is presented with great art work by storm thorgerson, who was the master behinde many of their other album covers.  the only thing wrong in my mind, it that there was nothing included from the atom heart mother album, but with so many great songs how could you include them all.<br />obscured by floyd
B00005NWRS|5.0|I am astonished and bewildered by the harsh critics of Ryan Adam's latest album &quot;Gold&quot;. I think this is an amazing CD. Since when was the quality of music defined solely by originality? Almost all music is derivative - frankly all art is derivative. That is the nature of creativity. It doesn't exist in a vacuum. It exists in dialogue with the world around it. As a musician it is only natural that Ryan Adam's compositions would be in dialogue with the works of other musicians. <br />I *LOVE* that this album evokes the work of other artists. That is not a reason to knock the album or Ryan. I love the chameleon-like quality where he experiments with styles and sounds of others and comes up with something wholly his own, while evoking the other. This is not imitation - he is not trying to pass himself off as these others artists. This is tribute! This is knowing the well from which you've sprung and acknowledging those who've influenced you. Homage - not forgery. <br />The breadth of this album astounds me. I loved &quot;Strangers Almanac&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; but I love this album too. Right now, I love this album more. I can think of no better rock-and-roll album this year.
B00005OM4N|5.0|It was all over the Internet by October 25th, but nothing beats the original version. This is clearly Britney's best album till now! Adding an R&amp;B and Rock edge to the so-called Pop, songs like &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, &quot;Lonely&quot; and &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; to name a few project a new and extremely mature Britney. Smashing hits like &quot;Overprotected&quot; will defiantly make you want to get up and dance. And the beautifully sung ballad &quot;I'm Not a girl, not yet a woman&quot; (Also the only ballad in this album) is defiantly &quot;Britney's Theme&quot; as the whole song seems to be towards her. Plus not forgetting the song &quot;What It's Like to Be Me&quot; which includes backing vocals by her boyfriend Justin Timberlake! Overall, this album is amazing, Britney's vocals have really matured, and there seems to be a fetish with covering songs these days! I would recommend this album anyone who is in the mood to dance!
B000002UAU|5.0|Five great songs that rarely are found on FabFour anthologies make this musical wonder a staple for any perceptive CD collector - Getting Better, She's Leaving Home, When I'm Sixty-Four, Lovely Rita and Good Morning Good Morning are these lovable tracks. Along with the four mega-hit classics also included (need not mention their names), this album gives clear evidence to the incredible talent and ingenuity this band encompassed throughout the forefront of the R`nR era.<br />Not only did John/Paul represent a phenomenal exception with their songwriting abilities, but also and with the help of George and Ringo, were in a definite class of their own as far as the appointment, organization and arrangement of original album name/covers and the quick to become household group name itself. I'm glad my ink's not running out! <br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band remains today among the top three studio recordings these truly gifted Lads From Liverpool came to release - Revolver and The White Album quite possibly the other two. The Beatles I believe were and still are the ultimate music icon this modern day world has and ever will come to know...
0452282152|5.0|I enjoyed this book and it's easy style.  It put me in touch with the world of Vermeer and the times and trials of living in his day.   It is the story of a maid hired by the family for the purpose of cleaning the artist's studio.   She is already an artist in her head because of family ties.  It clearly shows the place of women in that society and the limits they were bound by.  Enjoy!
B00005R87Q|5.0|I will tell you what, I went to an auction and bought a 95 dodge stealth with the rx7 twin turbo motor in it and it was already all decked out, then I made the mistake, I went the the fast and the furiouse, by far one of the best movies I have ever seen, the plot is awesome, The sister is well, Hot, and the cars leave nothing to be desired, with this combination this could have had horrible acting and still been good.  If you like fast cars and good action this is a definate must buy.  Needless to say that on the way home I lost my license for 60 days and got a good lecture...
B00003CXXJ|2.0|I went to see this movie when it first came out and I was very disappointed!!!! I just bought the DVD and it had a few extras that were neat, But I was still disappointed with the movie.  I only bought it becasue my kids loved it.  I believe Monsters, Inc will be much better being it a Disney/Pixar movie!!
B00003CXFG|5.0|Ok, this was one of those movies that made  you want to know more.  At least for me.  It was fun and not<br />bad to look at.  It was a simple plot and that never tried to rise above it's self.<br />It knew it was Entertainment and not a social commentary.<br />So don't go into it expecting art.  Watch it with a good time in mind and you won't be disappointed.

B00005OM4N|5.0|The new Britney Spears came out today (&quot;YIPEE&quot;) I know some of yall just hate her....unlike me!!! I'm a Britney Freak. This album has got a wide varietie of songs from the whisperie&quot;Boyz&quot; to the rockish &quot;I Love Rock&amp;Roll (Which sounds kinda tacky when they blend britney's vioce with those people singin' in the background. But hey...Tacki's O.K. I also like the 70's kinda song called &quot;anticipating&quot;. Britney kinda grew up 4 this album. (I mean she sayz a couple cuss words. Now little girlz r gonna go around saying things they heard on the BRITNEY C.D. I really do like this CD. It's like finally she doesn't sing korney junk like E~MAIL MY HEART. Take a pick.....&quot;Baby One More Time or &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;. The mojority of us chose &quot;Slave&quot;. I've fallen in love with the song &quot;Overprotected&quot;. It's alwsome!!!!!<BR>20,000,000 *'s
B00003CY0U|2.0|(...)<br />This is an extremely violent movie with many graphic scenes (...).<br />The movie itself isn't particulary worth viewing anyway.  The plot is very disjointed, and lacking.  I didn't know what was going on half the time, and they just kept jumping back and forth to different characters and not explaining why or who they were.  The script was just plain awful, and I thought John Travolta was overacting.  Although the character often reminded you of his characters in both \\"Get Shorty\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\".<br />He plays the bad guy, who is trying to wipe out terrorism with terrorism.  He has Hugh Jackman, of XMEN, hack into a bank's computer so he can be financially secure with his terrorist activity.  Halle Berry, who looks great in this movie, plays Travolta's sidekick.  For reasons unbeknown to me, she decides to reveal her breasts in this movie.  (...)<br />The whole movie is just confusing, and doesn't delve to deep into what is going on, and why.  It's just a mishmash of events, almost plotless, and just has a lot of stuff blowing up throughout it.<br />I say throw this fish back.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I love britney's new album, it definitely gives you a view into her life. the album is total all about her and every song has a meaning. I recommend this album to all britney fans: and if you are not a fan, get this album and you will be. I love you britney,you rock!!!
B000009ED0|5.0|I remember back in the 70s when bands knew how to throw a party.  Well thankfully we have Kid Rock now to remind us how it was done.<br />Every track on this CD is fantastic.  I truly loved it when I saw him for the first time on MTV Awards, when he came out with...MY NAME IS KKKKKKKIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDDD, KID ROCK! God, he was awesome.  I knew right there and then I was a fan.<br />I got to see him live in Birmingham 3rd row, center. My husband caught a drum stick, which was so cool.<br />I know Kid isn't for everyone, but if you can take the loud riffs, that awesome bass and all the sexual lyrics then pop it into the player and have some fun.<br />Everyday I listen to one of his CDs.  He gets me going and keeps me energized.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|i saw this movie in the theatre with a group of friends and it was hilarious! The jokes are wonderful it maked fun of everything Disney! One of the best movies of the year! A must for all ages.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I just ran out and bought this CD and I love it! The songs are great, poppy, fun, with good beats. I totally recommend this CD if you are laid back and like fun, danceable music. Britney is the best! :))
0060977264|4.0|I was onboard a flight to Verona when I read this journey. Why do I use the word 'Journey'? Paulo Coelho's works each has a journey and a message to share. I do not agree or want to agree with every message, yet the subtleties and the intricate story telling kept my interest and forced me to read on. 'By the River Piedra', is a tale of the power of love and Paulo's explanation of true love. Is love solely discovered with the person you are with, or the person you are?<br />The novel is both spiritual and thought provoking.
B00005OM4N|5.0|this cd is A LOT more than i expected it to be. there's a lot of good beats and NO FILLER!!! every track deserves to be on here. Overprotected, Anticipating, Cinderella, and That's Where You Take Me are the best tracks, with Lonely nipping at their heels. the pics are typical britney PG-13 material, but the MUSIC, what counts, is awesome. plus, I'm Not Yet a Girl.... is the BEST song of britney's...maybe ever. this Cd is worth every penny of it
B00005QDW5|5.0|Iv listened to every pink floyd album and with the exception of saucerfull of secrets i liked every single song on every single album, the legendary dark side of the moon, the powerfull &quot;the wall&quot; animals, wish you were here, now a collection of all the best is superb. By the way witch ones pink.
B00005QDW5|5.0|As a starving, unpublished artist, I often listen to Pink Floyd when working on my craft. I have been a fan since I was about 12, in 1973, when I bought the vinyl Dark Side of the Moon. After hearing that masterpiece, I was hooked. I quickly  (at least as quickly as I could scrounge together the money) bought every other Floyd album I could afford at the Detroit &quot;Peaches&quot; record store. <br />When I heard the band was working on a &quot;best-of&quot; collection, I was excited to see how it would turn out. This collection exceeds my expectations.<br />Rather than slap together the songs in chronological order, they have put together a 2-disk masterpiece, fitting the songs together in a seemless arc. Of particular note is the use of segue between songs, including some new effects and editing that brought a smile to my face.<br />It was probably a difficult task to fairly balance the work from the Syd Barrett era, the Roger Waters era, and the David Gilmour era, but the balance seems near perfect. The early Syd Barrett material sounds the most dated, especially the Beatle-esque &quot;See Emily Play&quot; and &quot;Arnold Layne.&quot; But the placement of the songs within the context minimizes any culture shock, and provides a brief trip down memory lane. I guarantee you will have no choice but to smile when those songs play, especially if you have ever seen &quot;This is Spinal Tap.&quot;<br />Several of the songs are edited, probably for the best . The title piece, &quot;Echoes,&quot; is cut by 7 minutes, but still clocks in at over 16 minutes. &quot;Marooned&quot; is cut down to a 2 minute piece that serves mainly as a bridge between &quot;Hey You&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky.&quot;<br />Overall, I think anyone with even a passing interest in Pink Floyd should add this CD to thier collection. And, although it's impossible to please everyone, Floyd fans will find very little to complain about. There are no gaping holes in the playlist, no obviousommissions, and the sound quality of the remix is exceptional.
6302293553|5.0|This movie is my favorite comedy movie, and possiby my favorite movie in any existing genre. This is one of the many &quot;cult movies&quot; that has people sitting around together for hours at a time, reciting their favorite quotes and nit-picking each other on single words. Each part of this movie is famous. Even if entirely uninterested in this type of film, it's a good movie to see, just so that you can say you're seen it in future conversations: it's a classic.<br />From the very first bit of dialogue in the movie, I was hooked. It opened with this fantastic scene in which Arthur and the rest of his knights were riding horseback - without horses. This may not sound funny when I describe it, but simply looking at their solumn faces as they &quot;dismounted&quot; already had me laughing.<br />My favorite part of this movie is difficult to come up with, but I think the Sir Robin song is one of the funniest things I've ever listened to; the &quot;Ni!&quot; scene was one of the funniest things I've ever seen on a screen.<br />It's long, so I would recommend seeing it in fragments. You want to be able to focus the whole time. This is not worth missing a word of.
B00000JPHE|5.0|I tell you if you don't like the old time movies then this it's for you. I love this film so awesome. M y husband grew up with these movies. he just loves them too. he told me these are the best. I did't grow up with them but I watch them like I did. the whole family come over to watch them. it's our monstertime halloween.
B00005OM4N|5.0|The CD came out today, November 6th, so last night at midnight when I got off of work I walked over to a nearby CD store to get this CD, because I really enjoy her newest release, &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot;.  This CD is not too different from her other two, but it is different enough that people who didn't like her previous albums might still enjoy this one.  There are only two slow laidback songs, and they're good for what they are, but the mroe upbeat, rock-edged ones are what this album is about.  The beats for some of the songs have a unique feel to them, and one of the songs, &quot;Anticipating&quot;, has a disco beat.  I think this album is good for Britney, because it shows that her music and talent has matured, while not changing enough that she loses her previous fans.  It is definitely a less bubblegum-pop album than the previous ones, and a more rock-edged one.  I was going to give it 4 stars simply because the CD is pretty short, but a lot of bands are making their CDs this short, so I figured oh well.  I think everyone can find at least one song on this CD that they can really enjoy, so it wouldn't be a waste of your money to get it.
B00004UEDQ|3.0|I loved this movie, and the whole plot of it. When I purchased the DVD, I expected it to have in depth views of the psychological aspects of many of the characters, and why they were used. Basically the only really interesting thing in the entire DVD was the filming of it. The reason that I gave it 3 stars intead of 2 or even 1 is because of one feature that is hardly mentioned. How to make the bubblegum wrapper chains that she makes to quit smoking! But when it comes down to it, its a shame that they spoiled the awsome movie with such a poor DVD.
0393317552|4.0|Guns, Germs, and Steel has an ambitious goal-to explain why the world is the way it is (and, importantly, why it isn't remarkably different), in less than 500 pages. Thirteen thousand years of human history, written by a biologist/molecular physiologist rather than a historian. It's an amazingly dense piece of work; it's intelligent and interesting to read yet not so easy to &quot;get into.&quot; I love these types of books-yet this one took me over a month to finish. <br />Jared Diamond seeks to explain why Eurasians conquered most of the world-why the winners won instead of the other way around. His thesis is spelled out pretty completely in the title: the winners won not because of genetics as much as opportunity: they won because they had seeds (agriculture), resistance to germs, guns, and steel. Each of these intercepted with the others-for example, immunity to germs, such as smallpox, was obtained by working with domestic and farm animals; animals that weren't around the inhabitants of the New World. <br />Diamond also tackles race head-on (yes, in a politically correct sort of way). He points out that genetics definitely helps confer an advantage to some groups (West African's resistance to malaria, for example), and that these advantages 'overuled' the military advantage of the Europeans in some cases. Aside from these examples, Diamond is leery to talk about neuro-biodiversity. I'm not, by any stretch of the imagination, claiming any race holds genetic *superiority* over another, but the *differences* in ethnic diversity are important to consider. Biologists, in particular, should be able to do this without fear of being labeled a racist, despite the abominable history of eugenics. <br />In the end, we have to remember that Diamond is not a historian. What he offers us here is a remarkable look at where the human race has been, and a plausible theory as to our routes through history. He did miss the boat on the FATES of society though--the future has yet tobe written. Although the book was difficult to wade through, it was worth reading, and deserving of its Pulitzer Prize.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The only purpose to buy this DVD is to showcase just how poor video quality gets on DVD. <br />This movie was showcased as a beautiful digital video experience in &quot;Electronic Cinema&quot; presentations. Utilizing superb digital transfers and high powered experimental video projectors there was an existing digital version of this movie that was superb.<br />Why the consumer version on DVD looks so soft is anyone's guess. Could there be a &quot;Collectors&quot; version we will have to buy to see a good quality version?<br />I make my living promoting quality home video. This is not a good example of the potential for picture quality with DVD production capabilities.<br />JS
B00005QDW5|2.0|First let me say - Pink floyd is the best band ever existed. They made music at it's perfect shape.<BR>BUT - Pink Floyd is not a band that should put out a greatest hits CD. Every CD that was made by Pink Floyd has it's own personality. every song matches the record and is an integal part of it. To take some of their more popular songs and put it on a collection disc - is WRONG. I think it's just another try to get some money out of us and it doesn't worth it! if you wanna hear pink floyd - buy their original CDs, you won't regret it!!
B00005QDW5|5.0|An interesting and not altogether disappointing collection of Floyd tunes. <BR> Along with the expected choices there are several good offbeat selections of songs, like &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free,&quot; &quot;Bike,&quot; and &quot;Jugband Blues,&quot; (which remains to this day one of my favorite Syd Barrett songs.) Sadly the title song &quot;Echoes&quot; is an edited version, and  although it certainly could have been worse, I can't help but think that maybe they should have left off something else in favor of keeping that masterpiece complete, especially as it IS the title of this best of collection. Editing it certainly wasn't the BEST OF choices. Shine on You Crazy Diamond is also slightly edited but does play almost complete through to part seven, and it IS nice to have that space between what was the end of the song on side one and the wind sound that opens the last half of the song on side two, merged into one continuous piece of music, in spite of the edit. Certainly a better job than the hacked up version that appears on  the Great Song Dances collection. <BR>Many of the songs are all linked together in such a way as to provide some fresh approaches to some old songs. Most interesting is in how Us and Them is merged with Learning to Fly. The last word of Us and Them, &quot;The old man died, died, died, died ... just keeps repeating until you hear a sound in the distance that grows louder until it becomes the opening of &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;.  &quot;High Hopes&quot; ends with the bell ringing for a bit until it transforms into a bell on a bike, which naturally leads into the song &quot;Bike.&quot; Most of the song segues do work fine, although I question the choice of going from &quot;Echoes&quot; into &quot;Hey You.&quot; The rather mundane &quot;Hey You&quot; does not make for an  entirely pleasant choice to listen to after the beautifully haunting epic of Echoes. The same goes for choosing to segue from the spacey  &quot;Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun&quot; into the noisy FM hit of &quot;Money.&quot;  <BR>While the song choices are pretty good, I'm sure everyone will have their complaints about what should have been. Personally I would have liked  them to have included the 8-track version of &quot;Pigs on the Wing,&quot; which has some excellent Snowy White guitar work used to bridge the two parts together. And including the unreleased ode to Roger Waters, &quot;Peace Be With You&quot; (said by those who have heard it to be the best Pink Floyd song recorded by the Post Waters Floyd) would have also been a good choice. But then you just can't please everyone, and you never will when it comes to these compilations.  <BR>At the end of the day it's a very pleasant listen, especially while putting together a Flash project, and right now that's what matters the most to me. <BR>It's Pink FLoyd. It's Classic stuff. It's 5 stars.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This one DVD you must own. The movie itselfs says it all, Award winning movie on 1994 and nominated for sound, special effects, and other stuff. This DVD really gets you into the movie magic &quot;through the eyes&quot; of Forrest Gump. The special features keep your attention on how great technology can be mixed with decades of american history and celebrities both popular and political. This is a great movie with not just a sense of humour, it has what it takes to be considered as must have movie on DVD.
B00004R9A4|4.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child. I remember the first time I saw it with my family for it's initial release.  I love that, for this DVD, Disney has included scenes that were cut before.  It's too bad that the audio for them was lost and they had to re-loop the dialogue.  Angela Lansbury's &quot;new&quot; song is a wonderful treat.  Disney won a well-deserved Oscar for the special effects of the armour army.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus proves versatility. Aqoues Transmission and Mexico proves how good they are in Classical and wish you were shows their rock.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I'm sure this collection will give much to gripe about for  diehard Pink Floyd fans but it will generally please mainstream listeners.  After Roger Waters's departure, the remaining members attempted to continue with albums like &quot;Momentary lapse of reason and Division Bell&quot; but they weren't more than recreating and revisiting old materials in sound and in structure. Given the talents of Gilmour, Mason, Wright, I am sure they could do better but until, it is safer to resort to a crowd-pleasing &quot;Best of...&quot; album. Storm horgerson did some wonderful work in the past but now his images are tiresome and repetitious. The cover of Echoes is the same self-important rubbish as the &quot;Shine On&quot; box set was. Roger Waters didn't have much saying in assembling this album and it shows. Only one song made it from &quot;Animals&quot; but total of 5 songs from the last 2 records, which are inferior to the majority of the old materials. The composition &quot;Echoes&quot; was butchered to 7 minutes shorter. Now that is unspeakable! Besides any Pink Floyd songs after &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; up until and including &quot;Final cut&quot; should be enjoyed within the content of the album.
B00003CXFV|5.0|I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but in this movie she acted like I have never seen before.  To tell you the truth, she really deserved that Oscar. Most of the time you would see her in those cheesy comedies; however, in this movie she showed that she had the true talent of a great actress.  All in all, great performance deserves a great honor.
B00005OM4N|5.0|What a remarkable third album from Miss Spears. I was not expecting to love it so much. Of course it has the classic Britney songs. The catchy, funky, dance songs that she purrs her way through like Overprotected,Lonely, Cinderella, and Bombastic Love. But there is a difference. The difference is that she has grown and matured as a woman and an artist and it is clearly evident on these tracks as well as the sexy, edgy Boys( which samples Nasty by Janet Jackson and delves into Prince territory) and What it's Like to Be Me...a fantastic uptempo track written by Justin Timberlake. The track seems like a leftover from Celebrity. He even provides background vocals that make this song unique and one of the best on the album. Anticiapting is another highlight. It's fun, sweet, catchy,carefree and is almost identical to Janet Jackson All For You..but Britney makes it her own and really gives a sweet vocal performance. Britney is in fine form. Her voice is stronger than ever. The best song is the lone ballad. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman. A beautiful song written by Dido. Britneys vocals are sincere, sweet, and yes powerful. This is the song that will prove to the world she CAN sing. She just needed the right song.A lovely song that has all the makings of a smash. A truly wonderful album, and a step up for Britney. She has grown as a person and as an artist. The teen pop phenom may be floundering but Britney is one that will continue to flourish.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|This movie is so twisted that I don't where to start.  I can't really explain anything because the story is so well presented that it is at the same time confusing. The fascinating thing about the movie is that it begins at the end and goes back to the beginning where everything is elucidated.  All in all, awesome movie &quot;du genre NOIR.&quot;
B00003CXTG|5.0|Simply put: the best damn movie I ever saw!  It's at least as long as Titanic, but you don't feel like you're sitting there that long.  Awesome movie!!!!
B00005LOUS|5.0|I think that The Grinch is the best movie ever created.  I recommend it to everyone to watch.  If you liked the original version of the grinch, then you'll LOVE the new one with Jim Carey.  I have a countdown going on until i can go and get it on the 20th.
B00005QDW5|2.0|This is not a great &quot;greatest hits&quot;.<br />There are to many songs from the new Pink Floyd.<br />The new Pink Floyd are not the real Pink Floyd.<br />Only one song from &quot;the final cut&quot;????? Why<BR>Only one song from &quot;animals&quot; Whyyyyyy!!!<br />Dont buy this cd.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams' soundtrack is wonderfully magical.  My daughter (a huge Harry Potter fan) and I sat together to listen to the entire CD. We enjoyed figuring out which part of the book went with each theme... was that the appearance of Draco Malfoy at the end of the &quot;Platform 9 3/4&quot; track?  Thank you, Mr. Williams for your engaging and magical music!
6302636779|5.0|I really don't know if I can find the right words to describe what I think of this movie.  Growing up Catholic in the late 50's &amp; 60's made this movie really hit a cord.  As a child, I really wanted to be a nun because of the &quot;cool outfits&quot;.  The first time I saw this movie, I loved it because of all the neat behind the scenes things you saw about the mysterious world of the Convent.  As I grew older, I finally realized that this movie was about the tremendous internal struggle Sister Luke had with being who she really was vs what she thought she wanted to be.  Any time I can catch this movie I do, the story never grows old and Sister Lukes's struggles seem relevant today.  The really poingnant thing about the movie is seeing the naive earnestness of the Colonials in Africa and knowing what fate they will meet 25 years later when the natives rise up and destroy them.  <BR>Audrey Hepburn is incredible as a nun, she does such a great job conveying Sister Luke's stubborn resolve not to be completely cowed by the convent &amp; it's rules.  She is determined to stay an individual and she does.  Needless to say, the rest of the cast is pretty impressive as well.  It's a beautiful movie, with magnificent settings and a wonderful message.
0790729628|5.0|I saw the theatrical version first and this is the version I fell in love with.  Sure, the directors cut may be true to Ridley Scott's vision (And I like it too, don't get me wrong) but it is not the version that I really want.  Or rather, I would like both.  I think it would be a huge mistake not to have both available on DVD.  Perhaps I can look forward to a collectors edition which would contain both versions, hopefully some extras, and a higher quality transfer.  One thing is for certain, I will not buy this version by itself.  However, if you are a first time viewer, I recommend this DVD.  It is a great story even in this incarnation (note the five stars)
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a great movie. Everyone can laugh at anything, from the strange characters such as Donkey, to the funny jokes that all the characters make. Shrek is a great DVD to get, because it comes with 2 discs, all loaded with TONS of special features, including Shrek's Karaoke Party, which is a MUST see. This movie is an overall classic! You GOTTA see this!
0767849493|5.0|This film suprised me more than any other film during the last 3 years. I recomend it to all true beleivers and people who like to think. The film challenges your faith and your standards. Watch it and you'll never think the same way before.<BR>Yes the language is strong and sex is mentioned almost in every line but the film helped me to understand religion much more than books written by theologians. <BR>Great actors and very clever directing will sweep you off your feet.
0780627032|5.0|The Nightmare on Elm Street saga lives on; In this boxed set edition, on VHS and DVD, with all seven films. The DVD versions of the film are packed with extras such as interviews with the directors of each of the films. All of the VHS versions come with the original movie trailers.  This is a must have for all horror fans.  It has Freddy at your fingertips any moment to the day. You can see him at his best (slicing and dicing) or at his worst (Death and Rebirth into a new nightmare).  Just don't fall asleep.  1,2 Freddy's coming for you......
B00005QDW5|5.0|As a longtime Floyd Fan, one might argue that I couldn't have any other rating than a stellar one.  However, as a former journalist, I strived to retain my objectivity.  Even so, this is the best collection of Floyd I have ever encountered!  It covers every Floyd &quot;era&quot; from Syd to post-Roger.  Fabulous stuff, and you can't call yourself a fan unless you own this NOW!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Usually Im not a fan of Britney, but this is a great album! Listen to it when you want to chill out and be happy. Really really good work
B00005QDW5|4.0|I can honestly say that the minute I heard that this album was being released, it was an immediate buy for me.  This despite my concerns about the idea that pulling individual songs from the holistic concept albums for which the Floyd are best known.  <br />Even so, I have to say that this is a phenomenal compilation, and to FINALLY have 'When the Tigers Broke Free' on CD is a real treat. In terms of overall coverage, the collection covers every era from Syd to post-Roger, but with the very notable exceptions of 'Atom Heart Mother' and 'Ummagumma,' as well as the two soundtracks, 'More' and 'Obscured by Clouds'. You can't be called a fan without owning this one!
0140177396|4.0|John Steinbeck's book is a definite future classic. The short novel features two runaways who find a job on a northern California farm bucking barley. The simple plot entrances the reader who is trying to figure out how it will finish. <br />Steinbeck creates two grown men who contrast almost entirely. First there's George, a short, squat, shart middle-aged man who has a sort of leader type personality. Enter Lennie, a giant of a man who has some sort of mental disease that renders him a &quot;dumb dumb.&quot; The two seem to create a famous mobster par, with George as the headman and Lennie as his big sidekick/bodyguard.<br />The two men were forced to leave their previous jobs and residence because of a mistake on Lennie's part. The two soon find a job on a farm along with a supporting cast of interesting characters whose personalities are exquisitly described by Steinbeck. George and Lennie are forced to scrimp and save their money from their bare minimum jobs in hopes of someday fulfilling their dream of buying a farm of their own.<br />Capitalizing on Lennie's mind, Steinbeck reates an out-of-the-blue plot twist at the end that reflects Steinbeck's book writing brilliance. This book never slows down, earning a grade of: Must Read
0446608955|4.0|This was the first book I read by Nicholas Sparks.  I thought it was very good.  I read it on the reccomendation of a friend.  This is something that I probably not have picked up without the reccomendation.  At first, I thought the story moved very slow.  I was ready to quit reading but my friend encouraged me to continue reading.  I am so glad that I did.  I thought it was awesome!  Once you get passed the first few chapters, the action really picks up and you just want to keep reading.  You feel like someone watching Landon and Jamie and feeling with them.  I was drawn in to continue.  The end was heartbreaking.  It was a marvelous story.  I love the way Sparks builds and shapes his characters.  I have picked up many other books by him as a result of reading this book.
0790729725|5.0|This movie has got to be one of Martin Scorsese's best.  It ranks right up there with &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Raging Bull&quot;.  I have always thought of Martin Scorsese as of the best directors we have today.  He always seems to a have a great attention to detail and always directs his actors/actresses into giving tour-de-force performances.  The film won both Best Picture and Best Director awards from the New York Film Critics as well as numerous Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Pesci) and Best Supporting Actress (Bracco).<br />The entire cast is exceptional, including Joe Pesci in his Oscar-winning role.  I was very surprised that Ray Liotta never received an Oscar nomination for his performance.  I thought he turned in one the best performances of that year.  And Robert DeNiro.......what can I say except that he's Robert DeNiro, one of the finest actors working today.  He has such a great scene towards the end of the film where he just finds out that Joe Pesci's character has been killed.  He is devastated and in such pain that he tries to hold it all inside.  Watching him try not to cry in that scene is remarkable.  And Oscar-nominee Lorraine Bracco has many great moments in the film including angrily confronting her husband's mistress through an apartment lobby phone and holding a loaded gun to her husband's face over his infidelity.  The soundtrack is another wonderful aspect of the film.  Every single song was probably specifically chosen for a particular scene in the film.  One of the disappointing things about this DVD is that it's not packed with extra's such as documentaries, director's commentary, deleted scenes, etc.  It hardly has anything.  In the future I hope they produce a Special Collector's Edition.  If you haven't seen this film then you don't know what you're missing.  It is a must-see !!
B00005QDW5|4.0|You've probably heard a lot of ho-huming about this album, especially from Pink Floyd fans. I know I have. And speaking as a huge Pink Floyd fan, I see where they're coming from. But that doesn't stop me from enjoying this album. Perfectionists will miss the rest of the albums these clips come from, but this is not an album for perfectionists.<BR>This is the Pink Floyd album for the masses. If you don't know Pink Floyd, this is the perfect place to start learning about the greatest band ever. No matter what you're taste in music prefers, you'll find something on this album to enjoy. From their bizarre, experimental early works to their tride-and-true Classic Rock favorites, the best thing about Pink Floyd is that anyone can find something in the music to enjoy.<BR>I restate that this is the perfect album to buy if you're just starting out, but if you have all the albums, you should only buy it if you're a completist.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This might very well be the best way look back on a 30 year career in music, but also a good way to present the works of the Pink Floyd to newcomers. The Pink Floyd and crew has does it again. Brilliant sound quality that leaves you tingling. Stunning artwork which truly echoes the spirit of the Floyd. <br />Echoes is an orgasmic experience that \\"blows you mind\\" as much today as any Floyd performance in the early years. <br />My advice is to buy this album! Not just because it's a Pink Floyd Album and not just because it's good. Go buy it because of the great feeling it gives you!!!
B000005B0U|3.0|The movie was faulted. The unfortunate sequel to the classic 1980 film just never got up to snuff. In fact, the movie's only redeeming point was it excellent Battle of the Bands sequence at the end.<br />Despite its excellent musical finalle, the film's soundtrack is, like the film itself, a mixed affair. The opener, Pual Butterfield's &quot;Born In Chicago,&quot; is top notch blues, but from there things get sketchy. The remake of Arethra Franklin's &quot;Respect&quot; is cool; &quot;Blue&quot; Lou's sax solo blows away the original, but the songs in between like &quot;Cheaper to Keep Her,&quot; &quot;Maybe I'm Wrong&quot; and &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; are mixed affairs at best. Things only get really good for the last four tracks, where the Gator Boys combination of talent and better song selection by the Blues Brothers Band redeem any faults on the album as a whole. Sadly, though, the best song int the whole film, Junior Wells' &quot;Checkin' On My Baby,&quot; is no where to be found. <br />Overall I wouldn't say this was the best way to invest in music. But, if you've got nothing else to buy, this would be a worthwhile investment for the highlights that occur. Despite being mostly a mixed bag, there is some excellent music on this disc.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is a masterpiece in every sense of the word...Tool has created some of the most original and deep music in rock history and this will most likely be the album that will be known as their masterpiece...easier to get into than Lateralus but more difficult than Undertow...many people who listen to this album for the first time won't know what to think, but once the music starts to make sense and the whole thing clicks, you're going to be in for the ride of your permanently altered life...
B00005OM4N|5.0|You may be expecting pure pop cheese, but you aren't getting it here. This is much more womanly, as well as her voice changing slightly if you listen closely. Here is my ratings out of *****<br />1-I'm A Slave 4 U-****-It's not doing so well on the charts because there's no US Single from Jive. Plus, it wasn't sent to many radio stations. But it should get higher through the release of the album. It's really catchy hip-pop and it's a change from her usual Max Martin/Rami formula.<br />2.Overprotected-*****-This is the third single off the album and it was NOT co-written by Britney. It's incredibly catchy and she also curses in this song, for those of you that enjoy profanity...HIGHLIGHT OF CD<br />3.Lonely-*****-A total rock chick tune-YES, ROCK chick tune. This is a rock song and I think the lyrics are good and the tune is great! Max Martin had a hand in this, and Britney helped write it.<br />4.I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman-****-The next single. It's the only ballad on the album and the only one with lyrics included. It's a pretty ballad and it's not a &quot;I'm the best cuz I'm not a girl anymore&quot; Actually, it's her singing about her being in between--&quot;All I Need Is Time, A Moment That Is Mine, While I'm In Between&quot;---Great ballad.<br />5.Boys-****-This one was also done by the Neptunes. Britney raps somewhat in this, something I've been waiting to hear!!! It was NOT co written by Britney. It's pretty catchy for the most part. This is a dance tune though!<br />6.Anticipating-*****-Has disco come back? It seems like this is disco! Anyway, this is really catchy and you should see her perform this in concert! (: It's cool and Britney helped write it.HIGHLIGHT OF CD<br />7.I Love Rock N Roll-*****-Let's just say it's a little better than Satisfaction and I'll leave you with that.<br />8.Cinderella-****-I don't listen to it as much but it's no ballad. There's NO MORE ballads. We were done with those three tracks ago. This was also co written by the Britster and she did pretty good!<br />9.Let Me Be-*****-WOAH! THIS is a good dance tune! Britney helped write it. The lyrics are very good and the tune will stay in your head forever.<br />10.Bombastic Love-*****-Unless that tune is blanked out by this. It's a really good tune about two people just falling in love for the first time. It's NOT what you're thinking...you just have to listen. HIGHLIGHT OF CD<br />11.That's Where You Take Me-*****-Britney discovers her roots (Oh baby Oh baby) She helped write it. It's pretty catchy and besides the Oh Baby's the lyrics are EXCELLENT! Good job Brit.<br />12.What It's Like To Be Me-*****-Even People Magazine liked it, how does that grab you? She says it's the best her vocals have done, she's right! Good job Britney Spears.<br />HOORAY FOR BRITNEY! After all this waiting it's here! On November 6, 2002, this review will be out of date because &quot;AFTER ALL THIS WAITING&quot; Anyway, I can't wait to see some more positive reviews! L8R! Bye! Britney Forever
6300214559|4.0|I saw the movi on TV, so I don't know how much was cut out, but I loved it! I'm really into the Elizabethan era, so a fairly historic movie with my favorite actor was wonderful. I was a bit dismayed that Dudley and Jane fell in love, but I understand the mptives, as obviously some people don't- if the two hated each other, it wouldn't have been such a great movie. All in all great his. fic. flick.
0062502182|4.0|The Alchemist is a simple easy to follow story about a young Shepherd who sets out on a journey to find his destiny. It really is a book that every young or idle minded person should. <br /> It's one of those feel good novels, that really does make you smile. And at the end of the day, thats what I want from a good story. The author proposes lots of philosiphical questions, such as &quot;the Great Lie of Life&quot;, and &quot;The Universal Language of Love&quot;, but never seems to dictate a certain ideology to the reader. <br />It's a breath of fresh air, though a little slow and sometimes meaningless in places it does manage to evoke a certain connection between the reader the the character of Santiago, which for everyone is different.<br />But, i feel it should be read, fable or no fable, its just a really easy, enjoyable read.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Everyone keeps saying they've sold out, or that they've just matured.  Maybe it's both, maybe it's neither.  Nevertheless, I listened to whole album and it really touched me.  I've always like Hard Rock and soft ballads and this album has touched both beautifully.<br />Morning View, the most artistic, beautifully written from Incubus will face the same criticism many other bands get from die hard fans:  &quot;It's nothing like their previous albums&quot;<br />With that in mind, they'll lose some fans, but will gain so many more with Morning View.  I compare this new album release to Stone Temple Pilots new release(Shangri-la Dee Da).  Both albums are giving out the same effect among new and old fans.  Ironically both bands had recorded around the same time and privately in rented Malibu studio homes rather than a record studio.<br />Highlights of this album are &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, their first single, a radio friendly, commercial song.  &quot;Just A Phase&quot;, a deeply melodic and emotional passage that gives me the feeling of looking straight into the eyes of your high school crush.  &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; two more soft melodies.  &quot;Aqueous Transmissions&quot;, an experimental sleeper with a touch of World Music meets classical movie scores.  This album is well paced with heavy tunes to soft melodic ballads, balanced each to create a nice complete album.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus has been quite a revelation for me.  When I first listened to it, I was immediately let down by the simplicity of the lyrics as compared to Aenima (where every phrase seemingly intermingles and warps every other neighboring phrase... i.e. Forty Six &amp; 2).  Fortunately I took the time to let the album talk to me.<BR>One aspect of Tool's methodology that repeatedly comes up in interviews is their desire to create something wholly un-egotistical.  That's why you never see them in their videos, why they play in the dark onstage, why they aren't MTV slaves like the rest of the modern rock world, and most importantly, why the music doesn't try to reach out and choke you to get to listen to it.  It may sound a little &quot;ethereal&quot; if you haven't experienced it, but when you give the same back to the music- give it time to breathe and time to affect you, without being egotistical yourself, it will improve you in a wonderful way.<BR>Tool's music works for a number of reasons.  First of all, the musicianship excels.  Truly awesome.  Just listen to Danny Carey's drumming at the end of The Grudge.  Secondly, Tool never steps out of the will of the music.  That drumming at the end of The Grudge wouldn't be there if the song's path didn't demand it.  Finally, the album is truly cohesive.  A single song alone wouldn't do anything special.  I realize that every time I hear Schism on the radio.<BR>It's telling to see so many &quot;nu-metal&quot; bands copying a style Tool gave birth to circa 1992-95.  The most obvious example would be the content of their videos, featuring &quot;frightening&quot; creatures that are about a five-minute make-up fix away from Stinkfist's blue people.  I emphasize &quot;frightening&quot; because when Tool did it, the message they stood for truly frightened me, whereas when I see it in a Static-X video, I just see the band trying to get as many stoners sitting on their couches to say &quot;dude&quot; as they can.<BR>All in all, no onecomes close to doing what Tool is doing in music right now.  They are truly innovating.
B00005QIPH|2.0|After all the hype I expected to hear something amazing and magical.  Unfortunately, this one fell a tad short.  Quite possibly because of it's hype and the unfair label that has been put on them as &quot;The saviors of rock and roll&quot;.  Not even close, but if it had been just another album put out without so much expectations then it would've been a great consistent rocker.  Although the lo-fi sound gets a little annoying.  &quot;Last night&quot; is the best song on the album.  A catchy tune with a classic rock and roll sound.
0425107469|5.0|this is a wonderful story for horror fans and animal lovers alike.he has so thoughtfully developed the characters that you will even cry for the evil one....i have never been so completely engrossed in a book in my life....and to be honest i have read many books since this one....but watchers set a standard with me and nothing else has even touched it....it is a must read even for people who aren't into horror/thriller/suspense....it is amazing
B00005QG9J|5.0|Everyone keeps saying they've sold out, or that they've just matured.  Maybe it's both, maybe it's neither.  Nevertheless, I listened to whole album and it really touched me.  I've always like Hard Rock and soft ballads and this album has touched both beautifully.<br />Morning View, the most artistic, beautifully written from Incubus will face the same criticism many other bands get from die hard fans:  &quot;It's nothing like their previous albums&quot;<br />With that in mind, they'll lose some fans, but will gain so many more with Morning View.  I compare this new album release to Stone Temple Pilots new release(Shangri-la Dee Da).  Both albums are giving out the same effect among new and old fans.  Ironically both bands had recorded around the same time and privately in rented Malibu studio homes rather than a record studio.<br />Highlights of this album are &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, their first single, a radio friendly, commercial song.  &quot;Just A Phase&quot;, a deeply melodic and emotional passage that gives me the feeling of looking straight into the eyes of your high school crush.  &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; two more soft melodies.  &quot;Aqueous Transmissions&quot;, an experimental sleeper with a touch of World Music meets classical movie scores.

B000001E8P|5.0|A brit pop classic right out of the box! The immensely popular \\"Different Class\\" album put Pulp on the brit pop map.  Hugely popular in Britten but scarely heard of in the states (thankfully). <BR>This record you can listen to from front to back with out skipping any of the tracks, each song is wonderful in it's own right, each like little stories. By far the most popular single on the album is \\"Common People,\\" the comic book that coincided with the single is pretty clever as well.<br />Although one of the best brit pop albums it's is not my favorite Pulp release. Don't get me wrong, \\"Different Class\\" is one of my all time favorite albums. Its just not of the \\"His and Her\\" caliber. <BR>However, it's a great introduction to Pulp (besides the \\"INTRO\\" album).
0451203933|5.0|I also read this book shortly before the recent terrorist attacks.  Mark Bowden goes into extraordinarily and painful detail in describing the activities of 1993 in which just over 100 Army Rangers and Delta force soldiers made a daring day-light raid on the city of Mogadishu, and a bustling market-place, and captured key lieutenants of the Somali warlord.  <br />Bowden rightfully tributes the last moments of over a dozen DIA and many casualties.  The book reads like a minute-by-minute action feature, and is almost impossible to put down.  Given the capabilities of these special-ops soldiers, I feel a lot more confident in our on-going efforts in Afghanistan.  I'm sure the Delta forces are working as we speak.  Many have deemed the Somalia effort a failure, but if you read this book, you will be convinced that the soldiers of this battle accomplished their objective and achieved victory despite overwhelming obstacles.
B00005OM4N|5.0|&quot;Britney&quot; is Britney Spears' finest achievement to date. This CD is heavily influenced by hip-hop and R&amp;B, even more so than the last CD. Several tracks have hard-hitting beats and great rythm. You can't help but dance when you listen. The song &quot;Anticipating&quot; has a great disco sound, and &quot;Lonely&quot; has a melody reminiscent of Janet Jackson's &quot;What about the Time.&quot; Her remake of &quot;I love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; is very well done although Joan Jett's version is a classic. The CD is very upbeat with only one slow song, &quot;I'm not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,&quot; which is a lovely song written in part by Dido. I don't enjoy &quot;Let Me Be&quot; that much, but the song is slowly growing on me. The Neptunes' contribution to the songs &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; brings out a side of Britney we haven't heard before. The enhanced CD features, which show a performance of &quot;Overprotected&quot; and outtakes from her new movie, are very well done. As a whole, the CD is amazing and Britney should be proud. She is truly growing both musically and emotionally.

B000002OOY|5.0|Ever since i was a kid and saw this movie i wanted the music soo bad i can taste it.  just listening to the 30 sec or so music from this cd i was hooked right away and i would recomend this cd to anyone who adores this kind of music it is really moving.

6304711883|5.0|&quot;Ransom&quot; is one of the more intelligent movies I have ever seen. Apart from being a very well made thriller, it's thought provoking, too. In fact, &quot;Ransom&quot; is game theory relevant, because the strategies of the adversary, as I shall call him, and the father - can be analyzed from a game theoretic point of view, within &quot;the game of ransom&quot;.<br />Optimal mechanism design suggests that some strategies dominate others on the part of the father. If we generalize the setup of the game a little, we will see that any organization facing a similar danger can be analyzed within a simple mechanism design setup. Let's stick to the film case in what follows. Given the objectives of the adversary, the father maximizes his objective function by never giving up to the adversary's requests, and thus removing the lever of advantage the adversary has on him. The sole power of the adversary stems from the fact that he came into possession of the good or a person, which or who is of enormous value to the father - in this case, the father's offspring. By applying a &quot;commitment technology&quot;, the father eliminates the adversary's advantage, and as long as he is able to stick to his wits and his strategy, i.e. have a credible commitment, also apparent to the adversary, the latter has little incentive to continue, since the mechanism of terror he planned, and counted for - stopped working.<BR> <BR>It's obvious that having acquired the offspring, the adversary has no incentive to keep him alive regardless of achieving his monetary goal. In fact, getting rid of the offspring permanently dominates the strategy of fulfilling his promise, and giving the child back. If the father predicts the incentives of the adversary correctly, he knows his offspring will pass away irrespective of his action. Therefore no matter how difficult it is emotionally, how hard it is on the mother, he should assume that the offspring would pass away, if he follows the adversary'sinstructions. <br />At this point, the equilibrium strategy emerges quite clearly. In any equilibrium of the &quot; game&quot;, the father should never pay the adversary. Also, in any equilibrium of the &quot;ransom game&quot;, the probability of the offspring passing away is one, unless the incentives of the adversary are removed by applying credible commitment on the part of the father with respect to the optimal strategy. The latter is to hunt down the adversary, and have him removed, devoting all resources to this end. Only in this way the offspring has the chance to live, as the adversary's best response to the father's strategy is to back off and return the offspring. This is true because returning the offspring as a strategy dominates the strategy of keeping him hidden, since no reward is to be expected, and the utility of being hunted by the whole world is less than the utility of returning the offspring AND trying another case, where the other father might not follow his optimal strategy.<br />&quot;Ransom&quot; is a very good film, very well made with respect to the traditional elements of a thriller - suspense, action, and credible screenplay. However, it's much more than that. It's a very conservative film in the sense that it praises following the rules of the game instead of emotions. What needs to be done is done, regardless. Almost identical motivational scheme could be used for justification of very harsh and rigorous law. I applaud Mel Gibson for creating a memorable role, and I applaud the screenplay writer and the director for offering us one of the most intelligent films that have ever been made. The fact that this film is also game theory relevant raises the rating.
B00003CY0V|4.0|All film-makers should have a morning mantra &quot;to be like Dominic Sena&quot;.  Which is simply to be original.  <br />The movie was a fun ride.  It kept me going through the entire film , and the characters?....  It was hard to not like simply all of them.  If you like action, flash, a quality line up, great music, and if you're a sucker for good 'ol originality this one is for you.
B000007ZBF|4.0|»G N' R Lies« makes the link between Guns N'Roses' debut album »Appetite For Destruction«'s garage-like rock with no compromises, and the two more polished and very artistic »Use Your Illusion« albums.<br />The first four songs, from 1986, are pure hardrock'n'roll. Especially track 3 and 4 - the rocking and melodic »Move To The City« and the swinging »Mama Kin« with its great rhythm (try to listen to this one with headphones on!) - are very worthwile.<br />The 1988 songs are more balanced and varied. »Patience« remains one of Guns N'Roses' most beautiful and fragile ballads, and the funny »Used To Love Her« as well as the lyrically very interesting »One In A Million« (the latter is not featured on new pressings - so be sure to buy the original version of »G N' R Lies« before it's too late!!) are tracks which highly justify the quality of this album.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This was a great movie.  I enjoyed the special effects and thought the story was well written.  It's a good look at the beginning of the STAR WARS saga we all remember.  If you're familier with the movies, it's kind of predictable what will happen in future movies.  But it's still worth it to see them as they come out.  I recommend seeing this movie.  It's quite good!

0380973650|4.0|If you consider how crappy most \\"fantastic\\" books are, this one is a real gem. However, take it from a rabid Gaiman fetishist: the man can do much better than this.<br />As a matter of fact, American Gods reads a lot like another \\"Sandman\\" instalment - think of it as yet another one of the dozens of side stories in the Dream epic. Hell, it even has cameos of many Endlesses!<br />You get it all: weird and very dark humour, charismatic and enigmatic characters galore, hidden and not-so-hidden references to any mythology you can think of, lots of witty and quite dead people... just like a condensed Sandman.<br />So it's all very good, ain't it? Erm... not really, no. In a number of places, things really look rushed and overlooked (eg. a scam scheme gets explained wrong, three characters meet by chance in the very same remote place to get the story going - think General Hospital logic -, there are a few typos...). No major problem, of course, but you'd really expect something better from one of the world's most prominent contemporary writers.<br />I also guess that the book might appeal more to non-US readers than the opposite, but this is just a hunch. As an Euro-snob myself, I found a few descriptions cruelly funny indeed....
B00005QDW5|4.0|I'll admit, I mainly bought this because I have just about all the studio releases of Pink Floyd, David Gilmour, Syd Barret, Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright plus I have a few bootlegs.  This would probably be a good introduction to Pink Floyd but I wouldn't recommend it for much else.  Many of the Pink Floyd songs shouldn't be taken off the albums but they don't do a bad job with their selections.  I'll admit its pretty cool to have a studio version of When The Tigers Broke Free though.<BR>If you don't have any Pink Floyd this album would be a good introduction.  I'm impressed that they cover more than just the &quot;Radio Floyd&quot; songs.  If you already have all the albums, you might want to think twice before buying this one.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|. . . as opposed to the &quot;Best Of&quot; (which would include &quot;I Build This Garden for Us&quot; from 'Let Love Rule', &quot;Fields of Joy&quot; from 'Mama Said', &quot;Sister&quot; from 'Are You Gonna Go My Way', the title track from 'Circus', and &quot;Little Girls Eyes&quot; from '5')<br />As greatest HITS go, my only disappointment was including &quot;Black Velveteen&quot; and somewhat banal &quot;I Belong to You&quot; from the 1998's '5' instead of the much better singles from that record - &quot;If You Can't Say No&quot; and &quot;Thinking of You&quot;.  I also have to enter a small complaint with the running order (&quot;Always on the Run&quot; between &quot;Stand by My Woman&quot; and &quot;Heaven Help&quot; - what's up with that), but I have that gripe about that with all greatest hits packages.  All in all, it's a good collection though and all the songs are full versions (which is often an annoying part of greatest hits records).<br />For those interested in more Lenny (beyond the Greatest Hits), I would recommend 'Mama Said' and 'Are You Gonna Go My Way'.
0790729725|5.0|Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is one of the best films of all time everything in this movie is good. But the DVD is not nothing speciel. The violence is not as bad as what people have been saying its bad. But if you think this is violent take a look at Meance II Society or Casino which are far worst in that. Anyway good movie but not so good DVD.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Excellent disc! I was expecting to hear a more slow and lala singing release with Britney Spear's newest release, but most of the songs are faster paced and good to listen to over and over! My personal favorite is track 2, Overprotected. This is a -must- purchase for any britney fan!
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is possibly the best film of the 90'es. Its so brillent in everyway its long but it holds you there just long enough intell you don't want to see anymore. The ending is one of the most unpredicable ending's in movie history. thats what movies are all about unpredicable,good acting,good story,good cinematography,and good direction and magnolia has it all.
B00005NB8J|5.0|From the director of The Patriot, Godzilla and Independence Day is none other than Roland Emmerich. This is a beautifully crafted movie. It even has spawned the series SG-1. Although the TV series is as good as the film, the film itself is still the best by all comparisons. And this is the kind of film that made you want to watch the movie over and over again. The only downside about this DVD release is that the movie, although in widescreen, is not anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 TVs. Other than that, this DVD release is fine on the overall. Stargate is still one the best sci-fi films up to date. With great plot and storyline, the film is sure to get you to hold on tight to your seats!<br />    And those of you who have a Home Theater System, watch this movie on a loud volume. It'll sure to blow your mind away! :) A one hell of a movie that'll take you on a rollercoaster ride of your life. Calling all sci-fi fans, this is one HOT movie not to be missed!
B000005HLV|4.0|Infernal Hails... <br />I must say that this album is not for trendies and wannabies who only listen to melodic black metal such as Cradle of filth &amp; so forth. This True Norwegian Hordes offers a real &quot;raw old-school&quot; metal sound that you don't get this days. The only other band that I've listened to and was able to create this kind of sound was Dark Throne's &quot;Transylvannian Hunger&quot;.<br />Some of the Legend songs in this album are, 'Pagan Fears, Funeral Fog, Freezing Moon'. Thus get this album, if you're a true Mayhem Fan!!!
B00005ASHM|5.0|I bought this on cassette, stuffing it into the top pocket of my denim jacket as I left the little, downtown store in Baltimore. It was late March1985. It was day two of my coast-to-coast adventure, hitching all the way to California.<br />So, I had chosen my music well. It was several days before I first listened to it. I had only made it as far as Indianapolis. The route had been all wrong and the rides were hard to come by. I looked kind of crazy and, I guess, your middle-American motorists steered clear of the gangly half-English guy with the indie quiff and Afflecks shoes.<br />\\"I feel so broke up, I want to go home\\"<br />When Brian Wilson wrote Pet Sounds, he was fired by rivalry with The Beatles. Perhaps this motivation is betrayed in a self-conscious cleverness about some of the tracks. It lacks the easy variety of The Beatles at their best. Nonetheless, melody-for-melody it goes every round with the west-coast Lancastrians. They win only on points. Praise doesn't come any higher. Pet Sounds is a masterpiece. <br />And in California, the masterpiece turned into a dream. I hung around the sunswept beach with a lithe, blonde Polish girl named Krystyna. She'd come over to taste a summer of freedom but she confessed to homesickness on our first night together. We slept, huddled up, beneath some canopies left out by the boat hire guys. Some days later, we journeyed to San Francisco. I gave her the walkman. She was crazy about God Only Knows and kept rewinding the tape. I introduced her to Caroline No and she gurgled and laughed, still wearing the headphones, planting a deep kiss on me. Sounds hard to understand, hard to explain, but it was the only time we kissed. <br />Krystyna left for home after eight days. My stomach churned in the madness, sadness, torment of my loss. The stupid, easy way I had let her go. Like we were just pals. I should have screamed on the tarmac to make her come back. \\"Now what can you tell her!\\" <br />I lost the cassette somewhere on myway back East. It was Fall 2001 before I could bring myself to buy another copy. I listened to the CD, a quiet Tuesday in the pretty, riverside trailerpark where I now live; back home near Manchester, England. I knew The Beach Boys were great singers, but I had forgotten how great singers they were. And how economical. This album stirs the soul. It moves seasons, geography and time aside. I was returned to California.<br />PS. Dear Krystyna, should you read this, \\"As long as there are stars above you.\\"
B000000W8C|5.0|The story of poverty, sex, drugs, rock and roll. At first it may sound a bit cliche. But from the get go in New Decade you can hear how genuine and serious Ashcroft is about his plight. While radiohead still sounded like a teen angst rock band the verve were above it all. By the second song or so, i just say to myself &quot;yes. this is the best band in the world i'm listening to&quot;. The album moves beautifully and has enough drug freak-outs/refrences and melodies to keep anyone happy.<br />One of the great highlights is Nick McCabes amazing guitar work. He really didnt recieve enough credit from the media even though he as responsible for the verve's sound as much as Ashcroft. On A Northern Soul, Nick's guitar work adds greatly to that enormous sound which easily rivals U2 and Pink Floyd.<br />A Northern Soul ranks on my list of best rock albums of the 90s and i reccomend it especially if the only verve album you have heard is Urband Hymns
B00005OM4N|5.0|Actually there's not much to say, because most Britney fans will have already bought the album and don't need my advice. All I can give is my opinion: I love it!<BR>Britney has certainly done a good job on this album. I think it's just as good as the other ones. I bought the European version today which contains one extra track, &quot;When I Found You&quot;. It's a really slow song and I think one of the most beautiful... And there's the cover of &quot;I love rock 'n' roll&quot;. I like it! As good as the original!<BR>People might say that the album is more mature, but hey! She's almost 20 now! Some songs are really easy to listen to, others are very suitable to dance on. I haven't gotten a lot of time to actually listen to the lyrics and analyse them or something. But I love it so far :-)
B00000JMOF|4.0|I've always enjoyed this version of Frankenstein, mostly due to Boris Karloff's look and portrayal of the creature. This DVD offers a good look at him, too, since this is a nice, clean transfer of the film. This presentation also is the uncut version of the film, and a couple of those reinstated scenes are the only portions of the film that don't look pristine.<br />The disc contains a commentary by film historian Rudy Behlmer, and like most commentaries by historians, crams a lot of information into a short period of time. Commentaries by historians can be quite different from those by the filmmakers because they are looking at it from a different perspective. They also tend to be a little dry and come off as being scripted, but that's OK because of the amount of information they provide. This commentary is no different and was quite informative. There is one peculiarity, however. Near the end of the film when the angry villagers are torching the windmill, Behlmer's commentary repeats a couple of sentences back-to-back. Since they are read with exactly the same inflection, it seems more a mistake in the production process than Behlmer accidentally saying the same thing twice.<br />The remainder of the disc is rounded out by the requisite filmographies, a fine documentary (The Frankenstein Files) and an oddity entitled &quot;Boo!&quot; The only apparent reason for the inclusion of this piece, besides its rarity, is because it contains clips of Frankenstein. It's a &quot;comedic&quot; short that consists of a narrator cracking-wise over clips of Frankenstein and Nosferatu (referred to as Dracula). Maybe it was funny in its day. The documentary is pretty nice, however. While it sometimes covers the same territory as the commentary, it offers insights into the creature's makeup (courtesy of Rick Baker) and interesting bits about casting and the rest of the production (courtesy of Behlmer and other historians).<br />This collection could have been pieced together from odds and ends, with the &quot;Boo&quot; segment being the &quot;abnormality&quot; that derailed the creation, but instead this disc provided me with what I was looking for-- a better appreciation for a classic film.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Maybe not.  But it's a heck of an effort, attempting to represent Pink Floyd over its entire history (1967-1994, I guess)with the obvious and the obscure.  This is a pretty good package: Disc 1 clocks in at about 77 minutes, Disc 2 is 78 minutes, so you get a lot of music for the money. <br />To me, it kind of plays like the soundtrack to one of those Pink Floyd laser light shows.  The songs aren't placed in chronological order, but rather programmed for pace and effect.  For some reason, I'm listening more to Disc 2 with &quot;Shine On...&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; and later on, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free,&quot; which is supposedly from &quot;The Wall&quot; movie.  The disc appropriately ends with a cut, &quot;Bike,&quot; from sad, crazy Syd Barrett, Floyd's founding father.<br />Disc 1 is no slouch, either, with &quot;See Emily Play&quot; (a single also featuring Barrett), a nice instrumental teamp with &quot;Marooned&quot; and &quot;Great Gig in the Sky&quot; as well as &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Pt. 2.&quot;  I read in some of the pre-release hype that this album was programmed as &quot;one continuous piece of music.&quot;  Uh-oh.  But it's not that bad -- the segues are logical, artful in places and fairly unobtrusive.  It's easy to pick out your faves and program into the CD player; not too much bleed-over from previous songs.<br />I suppose there are those who will view it as sacrilege that cuts from the post-Roger Waters Floyd are here. Not me -- I love &quot;Learning To Fly.&quot;  There aren't enough of those to worry about anyway, and they fit (especially if you want a complete picture).  Sure, there are some cuts not here I wish could have been included, but that's why I have a Pink Floyd CD library at home.  This is a good compilation for casual listening and for the car, and for first-time fans.  <br />I wonder if this means that Pink Floyd is finally over for good.  I hope not -- whatever the case, this CD makes great memories.
B000021YQV|1.0|This music is sooo old and tired.  These punks are your typical angry Californians...you know the ones...\\"Lets all Riot, and then cry discrimination when the Police arrest us for commiting crimes, lets overthrow the corupt government, the government puts too many people in jail\\"  etc, etc. Blah Blah.  (...) Anyway, musically the CD is average, and lirically the CD is terrible.  Only a cute video and MTV's air play (...) have brought commercial success to these sad sacks.  (...)

B000001FW9|5.0|A lot of GG fans seem divided on this album. I'm defiantely on the positive side of the fence, and this album is a personal favourite of mine.<BR>It all starts off with, what may very well be, the best GG song they ever wrote, and one of my favourite songs from any band, 'Pantraguel's Nativity'. You really have to hear this song to believe it, it's that good. The bass work, guitar work &amp; keys are all written to perfection. The vocal section in the &quot;chorus&quot; still sends chills down my spine...<br />Up next is 'Edge of Twilight', a nice little track complete with timpani and xylophone, followed by 'The House, The Street, The Room&quot;. This is the second Gentle Giant song I ever heard, and one of the stronger songs on the album. It's a rocking tune, and pretty darn catchy, yet about as far as you can get from a &quot;pop tune&quot;...<BR>The title track is a rather odd little instrumental by keyboardist Kerry Minnear. It's only short, and neither adds nor subtracts from my enjoyment of the album...<br />'Wreck', or as I like to call it, &quot;The Pirate Song&quot;, is an enjoyable song, and the first Gentle Giant song I learnt to play on the bass! However I must admit I haven't added many more GG songs to my repertoire... not because I don't want to, simply because I *can't*!<BR>'The Moon is Down' is a nice quiet track, with a fantastic middle section. The last two tracks, 'Black Cat' and 'Plain Truth' never really grew on me. 'Plain Truth' in particular was a song I never really warmed to, but the other fantastic songs on the album make up for it.<BR>As with their debut, and the album that followed this one, these probably aren't a great starting point for new commers to the GG flock. This album in particular has a very... I guess you could say... eerie tone to it that isn't really prevelant in later albums, but It's something that I personally enjoy.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Okay fellow lovers of the PC game, this is about making a movie that everybody's asking too much about it. Right Lara Croft is really something and besides her little nasty attitude, she looks good on screen.<br />Like it or not, at least someone did make a movie out of it, and for that we have to be gratefull. On my side, i think that any Tomb Raider fan will have to get this movie anyways. As far as i'm concerned, I must admit that I enjoyed it a lot :)<br />See by yourself...
B00003CX7L|1.0|Good news for parents who had young kids get scared by Toy Story: Disney and Pixar has made another movie, and called it Toy Story 2. I enjoyed the first Toy Story movie, even thought I couldn't beleive that Tom Hanks was the voice of Woody in the first and is again in this film. And this time Woody is famous. He aways was, but he didn't know. That in the 50's he had his own tv show called Woody's Roundup, in which the characters are puppets on string. But it got canceled becuase of kids only wanted to play with space toys. As Toy Story 2 opens, that his owner Andy (John Morris) is taking him to a camp. But Woody's arm gets torn and is left back at home. And while Andy at camp, his mom (Laurie Metcalf) holds a yard sale. And takes a penguin that is Woody's friend and sales him in a box for 25 cents. Woody goes off to the yard sale and falls off of Andy's dog. And Big Al who needs Woody to ship off the Roundupp gang to Japan, steals Woody after his mom won't sell it to him. And Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney in his last movie) goes off to save Buzz. And gets a warning from Mrs. Potato Head, &quot;Don't Talk to any toy you don't know&quot;.
B00005OM4N|4.0|If you think Britney rules, no doubt about it you will buy this album, but even if you don't, you will still like it! It is very different than her first two CD's. Much less bubblegum, much more diva attitude and a few good crusing in the convertible songs. &quot;Anticipiating&quot;, an up-beat song that gives off a Janet Jackson feel, is by far the best song on the album, very upbeat with almost a disco feel, with the her single, &quot;I'm a slave 4 u&quot; a close second. &quot;Boys&quot; has a cute new &quot;Britney&quot; feel, and if you like typical Britney music, she goes back to her bubblegum roots with, &quot;That's where you take me&quot;. Her cover of &quot;I love rock 'n' roll&quot; also is quite good. Over all, a good buy for you're 12 year old daughter or you're 45 year old sister, (well I wouldn't go THAT far!) but expect a few on these songs to hit the adult contemporary scene!
B00000DC7J|5.0|Just accept my word for it, if you miss out on this recording you miss out totally on what Piazzolla has to say and what Piazzola has to say about the tango is worth listening to.  While he was alive he was probably the best interpreter of his own work and very few since his lamentable death have managed to capture the essence of the &quot;new tango&quot; as he did.  Gidon Kremer is probably one and, for those fortunate enough to know the works of The Paul Taylor Dance Company and his dance based on some of the themes here, you can see how much Piazzolla's music is very much alive and kicking and open to new interpretation.
B0000062FN|4.0|This is the third and last album featuring the classic Santana lineup of Carlos, Gregg Rolie, Mike Shriever, Dave Brown, Mike Carabello, and Chepito Areas; two new members join the mix: guitarist Neil Schon and percussionist Coke Escovedo.  Schon's contributions are mixed -- he really pushes Carlos, but his over-the-top pyrotechnic rock playing often destroys the subtlety of the music; Carlos is overly generous with the playing space.  Though the music is still in classic Santana territory, the band's sound is substantially heavier (primarily due to Schon's presence) and more experimental.  In particular, there are more sprawling jazz-rock jams: &quot;Batuka&quot;, the classic epic &quot;Toussaint L'Overture&quot;, and an intense cover of Gene Ammons's &quot;Jungle Strut&quot;.  (Schon, Santana and Rolie engage trade fours in a pretty dramatic fashion on this one.)  There is another great Tito Puente cover (a frantic &quot;Para Los Rumberos&quot;) and they venture deep into Cuban territory with the fantastic &quot;Guajira&quot; (nice piano by Mario Ochoa).<br />  Some of Santana's weaknesses also come to the fore; these guys were never the best songwriters.  &quot;Taboo&quot; really drags, &quot;Everything's Coming Our Way&quot; is pleasant filler, and &quot;No One to Depend On&quot; is a decent attempt to replicate the success of &quot;Evil Ways&quot; and &quot;Oye Como Va&quot;.  &quot;Everybody's Everything&quot;, with a great funk gallop and the Tower of Power horn section, is much better.<br />  This album is halfway between Santana's classic Latin rock sound and the mid-70s jazz rock experiments; it isn't quite at the same level as either Abraxas or Caravanserai, but a great album nonetheless.
B00005OM4N|5.0|THe album as a whole is a very different type of album for her, yeah there are still pop songs on there, but songs like slave for u overprotected, im not a girl not yet a woman,boys and cinderella are in the top 10 best songs she has done and some of the best ever, and they areher most mature songs to date.  THis album is perfect, IMO there isnt one bad song on here. She is really maturing in her music, vocal talent, and as an artist(co-wrote 5 songs). She may be the queen of POP, but she doesnt get the critical accliam that she deserves, this album will finally get her that recognition. <br />THe album moves along very smoothly. The CD and album cover are both extremely fitting to the album. HEr songs seem like a mix of janet, prince, britney, and even a little michael thrown in there. OVerall one of the best ok the best IMO of the year.<br />She has come a long way from baby, to oops, and now britney. She is a true artist, Britney you are the best.
0790736039|5.0|This movie is about 7 best friends,aka the &quot;Losers Club&quot; and a killing 200 year old clown named Pennywise. Every 30 years the clown kills children, and all 7 children have had encounters with the clown, and one had his younger brother killed by it. They attempt to kill it by using an asthsma inhaler and throwing pebbles at it. They aren't sure if they killed it, so they all make a pact that if it is not dead, they will all come back and kill it. 30 years later the killings start up again, and they all<BR>come back to the town. But upon their return, people wind up dead and strange things happen, such as their fortune cookes with strange things in them, such as eyeballs, blood and crabs. Also at the Kersh house and the blood in Bev's tea cup. Strangly only the 7 can see these things. The first tape is mostly flashbacks when the 7 kids, now adults, get the call about the killings. The second one has the events when the 7 are back and attempt to kill it one last time. <BR>   I give it 5 stars because it was really, really good.
B000001AJG|5.0|This album made me grow up musically, it's so complex yet sweet, spiritual and loving. I bought it at a flea market in the early 80s prior to my teenage years. I didn't really know Stevie but bought it because I liked the colourfull inside sleeeve of the vinyl double-album. I'm not sure if it was a special edition or if it was the years of incense exposure from the pre-owner, but until this day, when I open the album, the inside is cented with a flower bouquet, it's wonderful. When I listen to the album, I can &quot;smell&quot; the music, it's such a wonderful experience. Anyway, through the years, I have grown with this music and it has grown with me. Each time I listen to it, I find new secret passages, experience new feelings, it's beauty had a significant influence on my live and my musical perception today.

B00005QDW5|4.0|Hello there.  Whether you are a diehard fan or a newcomer, this album should be welcomed onto your music shelf.  The songs are not necessarily in chronological order, rather they are set in order of continuity and mood.  <br />From the opening track to the last, the production is flawless, Pink Floyd as always are way ahead of their time.  Who would have guessed how naturally the songs flow into one another.  There was obviously a lot of time spent in constructing the album as a whole piece as opposed to songs in no particular order.<br />Even the early songs sound good.  This is by no means comprehensive but for those who wish not to delve deep into their pockets, this is a great alternative.  I would suggest buying the whole catalog but that would definitly be an expensive venture.<br />When the Tigers Free is a good song and will be worth it for completists, but buy it for the concept of a 2 &amp; 1/2 hour Pink Floyd experience.  This is a way for older Floydians to listen to Pink Floyd in a different light.  As an introduction to new listeners, it is a way to experience Floyd and see if it is worth it to dig deeper into their catalog.<br />All in all, worth the pounds, dollars or schilling necessary to buy it.
B00005OWIU|5.0|well first of all for anyone doesnt know this sound track is all music. barely any lyrics and the few that there are are very opraish. but this is one amazing soundtrack. i know what i said in the begining sounds negative but i didnt mean it how it sounds. Each song has its own flavor to sound somehow like the theme. Even i, one of those 12 year old boys that love rap rock etc, take time to appreciate the music on this cd. you can also relate to popular themes like star wars and jarrasic park. a must buy!...
B00002E233|2.0|For as long as one can remember, the horror genre has been the least respected in the world of film. Maybe it's because of the tilt to campy black humor the genre has taken for the past two decades. Or, perhaps, because of the formulaic manner in which the cast members can either be predictably the first ones to be killed off by whatever manner of menace, or seen to be the ones that have what it takes to survive. &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; manages to stave off expectations on who the victims will be, but the lack of a plot line and extraordinarily bad special effects eventually sink the movie's aims.<br />British actress Saffron Burrows plays Dr. Susan McAlester, a bio-engineering ingenue who convinces her superiors at her research firm to give her one more chance to perfect a vaccine that will cure Alzheimer's Disease, using mako sharks as the test subjects. She is granted her wish to continue, but is to be watched by executive Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson, the only name of note in this mostly cast of unknowns). There is one catch: The sharks have been given artificially larger brains by Dr. McAlester, making them harder-thinkin', harder-runnin', higher-killin' machines.<br />Dr. McAlester arrives onto the mid-ocean research facility with Franklin to run the ultimate test: using one of the test makos' brain fluid against a strain of Alzheimer's. Predictably, though, there's trouble on the horizon in the shape of a large storm approaching the facility. After the test is proven successful, the test shark manages to sever the arm of a lab assistant. The facility's crew (led by Carter, played by Thomas Jane) are all finding their life's work going downhill after that, when a rescue chopper gets dragged by a shark into the facility's surface area via a steel rope used to take the injured man up, and hampers the attempts by the others to get to the research area's surface, and finding opportunities for possible rescue. But the rogue test shark, and its two equallyfierce companions, stand in the way.<br />The main problem with the film, as a whole, lies with the sharks themselves. They are almost exclusively computer generated, and look very much like that. It has none of the panache of &quot;Jaws&quot;' electronic shark. The makos roam with incredible speed, munching away at human flesh at almost every turn of the movie, a seemingly ethereal sight. Also, we know the sharks are smart; but their advancement (recognizing the threat of a gun in their snouts, violently smashing out surveillance cameras, dragging a rescue copter into a building, setting off a chain of explosions throughout all levels of the research building) defies all logic! In the end, the implausibility of the sharks' behavior dooms whatever intentions the movie had to be a &quot;thinking person's horror flick.&quot;<br />The rapper L.L. Cool J. makes an appearance as the research facility's cook. It is amazing to watch him playing a character who at once spouts Scripture (thereby attaining the nickname &quot;Preacher&quot;) and profanities, almost in the same breath. Such inanities do little to endear his character to the audience. The other characters are even less human than the sharks, showing little remorse for their more unfortunate compadres who are victimized by the scaly carnivores. In fact, the moral relativism displayed by the characters take much away from their humanity, thereby dimming the sympathies of any audience with heartbeats for these protagonists.<br />It is, after all, just a horror film...one that just manages to stay away from all formulas. This is perhaps &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;'s only claim to fame, and only redemptive quality. If the film were a shark, it would be a lemon.
0618001905|5.0|I am not usually interested in books dealing with history.  I found this very fascinating.  It kept my interest.  It is devastating to think about what went on in the Congo.

B00005NWLO|5.0|I have my uncle's copy of the original reissue (on loan), the 1996 reissue, and I recently got this one. Comparing the original to the 1996 showed me that the 1996 edition was indeed a fine reissue. However, this new reissue completely destroys both of them.<br />The packaging is incredible (so beautiful that you have to see it to fully appreciate it), the sound quality is absolutely outstanding (the 1996 reissue was very hissy and wasn't as &quot;warm&quot; as this), and the bonus tracks are extremely cool.<br />When I first picked my copy up, I thought I was stupid for spending all that money (in Australian dollars it's a bit on the expensive side) on an album that I already had. Sure, I thought the bonus tracks would have been nice, but I didn't think the sound quality or packaging could get any better than the 1996 release. Well, as soon as I opened it up and saw that the way the cover was done, and when I saw the cool crowd photo inside, I knew that I had made the right decision by buying it.<br />The sound quality is so good because it was remastered from the original masters and remixed on vintage equipment (tube-based, I'd assume, which would explain the &quot;warm&quot; feeling that these CDs have). Who did the remixing? Skynyrd's original live sound engineer. Also, if you have the 1996 version you'd know that during &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot; the sound dies on one channel. Well, that's gone now! Although that may seem minor, it was an annoying glitch that took away from the album.<br />Extra audience response and speech have also been added to this new reissue, making it more like being at a Skynyrd concert than ever. Remember how Ronnie makes a &quot;grrrrr&quot; noise before &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot;? We now find out that he did that because the piano broke. Little things like that really do make you feel like you're at the Fox Theatre in 1976.<br />The bonus tracks are outstanding. In fact, some of them are as good as -- if not better than -- the cuts that were used on the album. That's my opinion; you can be the judge if you buy this. The album cut of &quot;Free Bird&quot; actually contained a solo later overdubbed by Allen Collins. Because the original master for that wasn't available, we instead get the original version. The &quot;Free Bird&quot; solo on this is actually BETTER than the overdubbed one. Sure, there are a few mistakes, but it sounds more &quot;authentic&quot; than the overdubbed version. And it's a bit like having an extra bonus track because it's the first time we've heard it. <br />If you've been thinking, &quot;I already have the other reissue -- it'd be a waste to buy this one,&quot; then you'd better think again! For any Skynyrd fan, this is an essential purchase, and if you aren't a Skynyrd fan but want to get into this great band, then this is even more essential. You just won't find a better Lynyrd Skynyrd album than the deluxe edition of &quot;One More From The Road.&quot;<br />FLY HIGH, FREE BIRD!
B0000024U8|5.0|I'm surprised by all the dissing the Stills material has taken. Granted, it's kind of an unfair comparison with the Bloomfield stuff, which definitely smokes more, but that doesn't take anything away from Stills as a guitarist. He was never into the Chicago blues thing, so it's apples and oranges. Together, however, they're one tasty fruit basket! Kooper had the great vision - and courage - to make this album happen without a safety net. The liner notes tell it all - this is about brilliant talents getting together and just getting down to business. The Dylan cover should've been a hit single; it's better than the original and I almost never think covers can equal the original.  As Kooper told me one time when I asked, the way it's done on Super Session was one of the ways it was recorded with Dylan, but His Bobness chose the slower version that appears on Highway 61 Revisited. Anyway, this is an essential album that no true rock fan can be without.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|After buying the DVD and watching it, I couldn't help liking it even thought it was geared towards little children with the fairy tale story and all. It had a hilarious story line with the combination of all your favorite fairy tales with the new fairy tale princess and her ogre &quot;knight in shining armor&quot;. I won't ruin the story by reveiling the plot so I just leave it at that. The computer animations used to make this movie was one of the best I've ever seen (with the exception of Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within).
6305358567|5.0|This movie on Queen Elizabeth I of England was absolutely extraordinary! The actors are absolutely incredible, particularlly Cate Blanchette, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Richard Attenborough, John Gielgud, and Christopher Eccleston. The story is suspenseful, the characters are genuine, and the history sticks to the most basic account of Elizabeth's early reign. The settings are wonderful and convincing, and the movie shows great insight into the troubles of the young queen. Do not view this movie if you are looking to pass your history exam with this. Rather, view it as a well acted, beautiful, suspenseful, and gothic story. A word of warning for parents: definitely not suitable for children.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This double CD has pretty much what a Pink Floyd fan would expect to find on it and I guess that's a good thing, though I was disappointed to see that it did't include any material from the &quot;Umagumma&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; and &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; albums.  This album includes the song &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot; from the film version of &quot;The Wall&quot;.  This song was released on vinyl in 1981, but has been out of print for 20 years and has never been release on CD.  I was very happy to find it on this collection, because it is in my opinion Pink Floyd's best song.  The digital remastering is very good.  You can hear all the faint voices and stuff like that without having to turn the volume up all the way.  The feeling of a Pink Floyd album is preserved by having songs that faded into the next song on the original albums remixed to fade into the next song on this compilation.  Purists will complain about this sort of thing, but I think that's silly when you can still find the songs in their unaltered form on the albums from which they came.  All in all, it's a collection worth owning (the cover alone is worth it) and a great introduction to the band for new fans.
0425170349|1.0|What a gagger!<BR> Clancy's 1-dimensional characters get more and more boring, and here they're in a plotline that's improbable at best. His treatment of women is condescending, to say the least (one wife, a doctor, says to her spec ops operator husband, &quot;You kill people? I'm not sure I like that...&quot;)<BR> The story, albeit interesting, goes on altogether too long. I found myself reading the last 200 pages or so just to find out what happened.<BR> The more detail Clancy goes into, the more he gets wrong. He's descending into Mack Bolan territory, it seems. It takes more than several heads &quot;exploding like a ripe melon&quot; to make a decent novel. If you're already a fan, you'll love it-- it's the same crap he's been pumping out since &quot;Sum of All Fears.&quot; If you're not a fan, grab &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; or &quot;Red Storm Rising&quot;-- 2 really good ones by Clancy; before he started believing his own press releases.

B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD, IMO, is her best so far. I disagree when people say its not all that edgy. Compared to Baby One More Time and Oops.. I did it again this CD is downright SEXY. The one and only ballad, I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman is really pretty, and is a potential Britney classic. My favorite of the &quot;edgy&quot; tracks are the sultry, &quot;Boys&quot;, the anger-management worthy &quot;Overprotected&quot;, and the techno sounding &quot;Cinderella&quot;.  The only sound that doesn't do it for me is the disco-y &quot;Anticipating&quot;. Overall, this CD is excellent. One of my favorites, and if NSYNC thinks that they have &quot;Dirty Pop&quot; they obviously haven't listened to this cd.<br />                 9/10
6304258984|5.0|This movie is the single greatest action movie I have ever seen.  It's very entertaining.  It packs high power stars (Cage, Connery, and Harris) along with a heart pumping soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and the gang, and tops it all off with the high voltage producers Bruckheimer and Simpson (Days of Thunder, Crimson Tide, Armageddon and Con Air).  Micheal Bay brings his unique style of non stop camera movements seen in the 'Aaron Burr' milk commercial as well as Bad Boys and Armageddon.  Be prepared for one major league blast.  Watch this movie.  I think you'll be glad you did.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Well I own all of the pink floyd cd's so one would wonder why buy a best of that is picked by someone else? There will always be arguments as to which songs are the &quot;best&quot; but this collection is a nice splattering of their work. I like that it's not in chronological order because that's too methodical and this does seem to flow ok. Of course you've got the great floyd songs with the digital remastered sound and you can't beat that. It's interesting to hear the old Barrett songs and the newer floyd mixed in side by side. A great booklet also as it indicates where each song came from and a little art work to eye. No songs from 'more'-'obscured by clouds'-'atom heart mother' or 'ummagumma'. But-I PUT THE STAMP OF APPROVAL ON THIS BEST OF ANYWAY.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Just when I thought Tidal couldn't be surpassed I listened to the brilliance of When the Pawn...and changed my mind. Although incorporating a different sound and feel than Tidal, Fiona continues to put words to her feelings straight from the depth of her soul and that is why I love her music. She has the incredible talent in translating desires and awareness into words that I could never do. Each time I listen I am left in awe. Fiona trully has a unique talent.<br />If you haven't experienced Fiona I suggest that you disregard your preconceptions and give her a try. At first I didn't pay much attention to her when she first arrived on the scene but thankfully I later came across Tidal and was an instant fan.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd has released several hits compilations, but Echoes is the first to span the entire Floyd catalog.  From the Syd Barrett led days to the more recent Roger Waters less incarnation, all their eras are representing including a previously unreleased song, &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot; which is from The Wall movie.  What makes the album extremely interesting, especially for Floyd fans who have these songs already, is the sequencing of the music.  Not following the traditional greatest hits album track listing in chronological order, songs are sequenced to seamlessly flow into one another creating the effect of one long song suite per disk.  All four band members were heavily involved in the song selection and sequencing, but unfortunately they never got into the studio together.  Echoes is a great way for Floyd neophytes to be introduced to the band and for long time fans to get a new track and hear the music in a new and different way.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Buy this,listen to this,you will be left awestruck and speechless. The greatest ever,period!
B000002J1S|5.0|By far, this is the best Genesis album ever produced.  Peter Gabriel is nothing short of amazing on this album.  Phil Collins is still playing drums for the band at the time of production, but his presence and influence can still be felt.<br />If you are any kind of a Genesis fan or Peter Gabriel fan for that matter, this album is a must have.
B000002UA0|4.0|This may well be the most difficult album to review.  If you seek this out expecting a more trippy version of Dark Side of the Moon, you'll be disappointed.  Listen to it while you're as high as Syd Barrett no doubt was when he wrote much of it and you'll have nightmares.  Listen to it expecting a linear musical theme and you'll shut it off  after 4 minutes, wishing you could get that time back.  Whatever you think of it upon first listen will be different than the next.  Piper asks much of its listener and probably wasn't intended to be taken in all in one sitting.  All in all it doesn't feel unified enough to qualify as a great album, as much as it is a forgotten musical phenomenon.  It does serve as a precursor to early Bowie, Lou Reed (whose own Velvet Underground simultaneously touched on similar themes) and Sonic Youth.
B00005R1N3|5.0|I saw this film for the first time when I was a child, late at night, with the lights off and was scared and awestruck by this truly terrifying and groundbreaking film. Never before or since has there been a killer in a horror film so insane. The script, acting, and humor are top notch. The suspense is almost unbearable because of what's not seen or known to the viewer. Your imagination is what this film uses to frighten you, not blood and gore galore. It has the most original ending (not done since, that I know of) I've ever seen in a film of this genre. I think last years &quot;Limbo&quot; was the first to repeat such an ending, 25 years later! I'm stunned this film wasn't a huge hit when originally released in 1975. I've owned a copy of it on VHS for the last 5 years and the tagline on the cover truly prepares you for viewing the film: &quot;If this movie doesn't make your skin crawl, it's on too tight.&quot; Every person I've shown the film to has thoroughly enjoyed and been totally creeped out by it, and they'd never heard of it! What a shame. Hopefully now that it's being released on DVD, it will be rediscovered by the public and be placed on critic's list's as one of the best horror/suspense films EVER. Warning: This film should NOT be viewed alone.

B00005OM4N|5.0|As a Britney fan, I'll probably be notably biased in my review of this CD. Last year, when &quot;Oops&quot; came out, I was rather disappointed. Although the CD eventually grew on me, it was a pop CD, not a Dave Matthews Band CD - pop CDs are supposed to catch you on the first listen, not draw you in after several. &quot;Britney&quot; makes up for it as every song - even the ones she wrote - are noticeably strong and good on the first listen. This is by far Britney's best release(of 3). Even the cover &quot;I Love Rock and Roll&quot; sounds well done and not cheesy(like &quot;Satisfaction&quot; seemed) - except for the lack of updating it....jukeboxes don't take dimes :) . Plus, if you're a Sopranos fan, track five - &quot;Boys&quot; - sounds a little like the theme song...although it's hard to see Tony listening to Britney. I give it five stars because it is an excellent pop release - remember to take into consideration that it is a pop release, pop music isn't really made to be timeless(although it has more staying power than N' Sync's celebrity). So, if you like pop music and catchy hooks, I'd recommend giving this album a shot. If you like more instrumental stuff, however, I'd look elsewhere - particularly Bela Fleck and the Flecktones.
B000003BEV|4.0|The Stones arrived relatively late on the psychedelic scene and in 1967, by which time the Beatles set the standard with Sgt. Pepper and the Beach Boys offered their own sonic experiment Pet Sounds. Meanwhile Their Satanic Majesties Request may still be the most universally panned album by a band in its creative prime. In the mid 60's the Stones followed musical trends more than establishing them, only incorporating sitars and orchestral arrangements after the Beatles and Phil Specter had done it all better. Critics probably interpreted Satanic Majesties as a clumsy copycat effort, proving that Mick and Keith uncomfortably kept up with the trends rather than setting or adding to them. <br />In that sense, this album is a mess. After it, they followed with the outstanding Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers, leaving psychedelia behind and never looking back. But if you listen to Satanic Majesties alongside Magical Mystery Tour or even Sgt. Pepper, you find a devilishly amusing sendup of the genre. (Perhaps &quot;Their Satanic Majesties'&quot; request was to debunk the love affair with all the artistic indulgence.) She's A Rainbow sounds forgettably silly until you reach the bridge in what sounds like Brian Jones sawing a violin in half with the bow followed by ridiculous thumping percussions. Other songs, like 2000 Light Years from Home, with its futuristic keyboard collage, still stands up, even stripped of its context.<br />After a retreat with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Lennon and McCartney abruptly disowned psychedelia in favor of harder hitting and folksy tunes, as if they had been swindled. Satanic Majesties suggests the Stones already knew something.
B000002B35|4.0|There are many things I like about this album, and many things I do not. The sound quality and effects, compared to &quot;Delicate Sound Of Thunder&quot;, are fantastic. If you are looking for identical renditions of Floyd's best look elsewhere (good luck). I doubt they played &quot;Intersteller Overdrive&quot; the same way twice. the version of &quot;Dark side&quot; Is very moving and i love Dave's comment at the end. The only problem that I have is the song choice. I know for a fact that they played &quot;Welcome To The Machine&quot; and &quot;Have A Cigar&quot; during the tour, so why did'nt they include those songs on the CD. I really didn't need new versions of Sorrow&quot; or &quot;Learning To Fly&quot;. The playing , however, is excellent and the new versions of &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;and &quot;Hey you&quot; (Can you tell it's not roger at the end) Are better than the originals. Pink floyd are not, and should not, be limited to sound patterns and should be given the opportunity to expand the songs beyond how we &quot;hear&quot; them. They do on &quot;Pulse&quot;.

B00005OM4N|5.0|From listening to the album, I knew this CD was going to be the turning point of Ms. Spears' career. It seems that Britney has grown up these past three years and has no signs of backing down. With her hit song 'I'm A Slave 4 U' produced by The Neptunes, it gives more of an R&amp;B and edge that Spears has always wanted. Furthermore, Britney Spears has shown people what she can do by co-writing four of her twelve songs on her 'Britney' CD. All of which are pretty outstanding, (save for the mellow Dear Diary on OODIA) and impressive coming from a 19 year-old girl. Way to go, Britney!<br />1. I'm A Slave 4 U - 10/10<BR>The Neptunes did an excellent job producing the song. Britney sounds amazing and the song is very catchy. Good way to start promoting her CD.<br />2. Overprotected - 10/10<BR>Britney mentions she can take care of herself and does not need anyone to control her life. A strong and positive song. I like it very much.<br />3. Lonely - 9.5/10<BR>One of the songs that Britney co-wrote and *darn* she did a pretty good job at it! Very catchy!<br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - 11/10<BR>A very, very beautiful ballad, and unfortunately, the only one on her album. Here in this song, she sings that she isn't a girl no more, and is on her way making her own decisions as a woman. A very mature song that you should not pass up.<br />5. Boys - 10/10<BR>Boys... I love them! Er... I meant the song! ^_^ Actually, the song is about how she sees a guy and wants to dance with him or something. Anyways, it seems this is almost everyone's fav. from my view, but I'll let you decide!<br />6. Anticipating 11/10<BR>One of those songs that deserve higher than 10. I absolutely adore this song! It's so cute and fun, and cheers me up when I'm down! Very catchy. I find myself singing it everywhere I go. Actually, the darn thing is still in my head.<br />7. I Love Rock &amp; Roll 9.5/10<BR>I was slightly disapointed with Rodney J.'s production with the song. I found it wasn't very rockish, and it included more of a R&amp;Bish sound. However, it is a very good remake, none-the-less, and don't let the review scare you! It's really catchy and nobody could redo the song better than Britney! <br />8. Cinderella 12/10<BR>Alright. Cinderella is by far one of the most interesting songs on her 'Britney' album. Especially the chorus near the end. I even sometimes get goosebumps by listening to it. Really, it's kind of hauntingly sweet, and the song is very, very good, even 'til the end.<br />9. Let Me Be 10/10<BR><BR>This song probably has the most intelligent lyrics on her album. It's a about how this guy doesn't believe she can't go on her own, and she will not look back at the past and is completely different. Word of Advice: Let Britney Be, and you'll have a happy Britney. Also, this song is featured on the On The Line soundtrack. Neat.<br />10. Bombastic Love 9/10<BR>My least favourite song, but good, nonetheless. It kinda reminds me of old school Shaggy sometimes.<br />11. That's Where You'll Take Me <BR>Ahh... love. Wait. Hasn't love been one of the conflicts Britney has faced in her songs thus far? Well, this song is very nice a dreamy-like. I would of classified this as a ballad, but the rhythm is mid-tempo so... <br />12. What It's Like To Be Me<BR>Britney's 'Britney' finale is an upbeat song, written by no other than Justin Timberlake! (oohs &amp; aahs) This song is how she challenges the guy. If he wants to be hers, he has to know what she does for a living. As in 'walk a mile in my shoes' and 'if you don't like what I do, go away' kind of attitude.<br />If you don't have it, buy it. No regrets.
B00005QDW5|5.0|I picked up this CD first thing when it came out this morning and it is awesome.  It includes all of Floyd's best songs in a 2 cd set.  Every Pink Floyd fan should have this album.
B000002UZ1|4.0|... Where is &quot;I want you&quot;, their heaviest song, and what a song ! Lennon lives !
B0000508U6|4.0|I really liked the &quot;Yellow&quot; single (reminded me of Dave Matthews Band except not as sophomoric) but &quot;Don't Panic&quot; was what made me buy the album.  I'm really glad I did.  Simple and thoughtful.  Radiohead-lite comparisions are apt and not insulting, and it even reminds me a little of Nick Drake.  I listen to it several times in a row before switching CDs.
B00005OMTT|4.0|Each of the enigma albums is a continuation of one long piece.<BR>I have followed from the start and was hoping for part five.<BR>Instead we have a greatest hits type cd.  There are to be 10 albums in all to complete the series.  Let's get on with it.<br />This is a great way for new listeners to experience Enigma, but not great for the followers who already have the first four installments.<br />Maybe MC needs some time to complete the next masterpiece and has to fufill recording contract obligations regarding release dates.  <br />Anticipating new material.....
B00005OM4N|5.0|I really enjoy this new album. I think it is the real britney with this cd. I think her voice sounds the best it ever has and it makes me want to dance. I think you should give it a chance. i think she is going in the direction that she is supposed to. I proud of Brit! Keep Rockin girl!!<br />Kelly
B000000WA4|5.0|Possibly one of the greatest compilations of music, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness even after 6 years of  continual listening still moves me and makes me sad that this band is no more. From track one to track twenty eight this whole album defies definition  and ofers heavy to almost hynotic songs. For anyone who is a music lover or just anyone this is a must buy.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Most songs on &quot;Britney&quot; seem to be heavily influenced by Janet Jackson and NSYNC. Fans of these artists should enjoy the new Britney album.
0517122707|2.0|Indeed this book has some genius in it, on the whole I thought it was just a little too much and I can't understand why there are those who think this is a great book. How can this book be mentioned along with Don Quixote?  Miguel de Cervantes was a great novelist.
B00005OM4N|4.0|UPDATED: August 17, 2011 (NOTE: I tried to keep the overall reviews content to same, but with better grammar, and an updated outlook since this review was almost 10yrs old.<br /><br />The answer to your troubling question.....Yes.<br />This was Britney's first attempt at really making a fully realized artistic statement. Which doesn't say a whole lot considering her album prior to this were pure bubblegum pop, and while this one does not stray too far from the formula, it definitely has a harder edge to most of the songs then &#34;One More Time...&#34; or &#34;Oops&#34; did. The slick groove of the opening track &#34;I'm a Slave 4 U&#34; kicks the album off and takes Britney from wide-eyed virgin to becoming a fully sexualized adult, the vocals are very breathy and with the accompanying video, this was a huge step in to adulthood for Britney (love it or hate it), it is in a way, a bit of a kiss off to her detractors:<br /><br />&#34;I know I may be young But I've got feelings too And I need to do what I feel like doing So let me go and just listen.&#34; (the opening line from the song.<br /><br />&#34;Overprotected&#34; continues the trend of trying to get people to back off and just let her be her by declaring she is &#34;So damn overprotective&#34;, and the Dido co-written track &#34;Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&#34;, continues to solidify this theme in the album, telling people &#34;I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe, I'm just trying to find the woman in me.&#34; All three of these songs were singles, the first three singles from the album actually, and really shows how much Britney wanted to be viewed as a woman in the making and not just merely a little girl who records pop music anymore.<br /><br />The album consistently continues this theme of asserting her independence as a person in different ways, throughout the album in other tracks such as &#34;Let Me Be Me&#34;, &#34;Lonely&#34;, and &#34;That's What its Like to Be Me&#34;. The rest of the songs range from the thumping and Janet Jackson-esque &#34;Boys&#34; (which is an anthem of sorts) to the the mundane and overdone &#34;Cinderella&#34; and &#34;Bombastic Love&#34;. The album is never boring, but once it strays from the straight-forward sex-driven or self-independence tracks, it really loses its footing, this is especially true in the case of &#34;I Love Rock'n Roll&#34; while not a horrible cover, it more feels like it was done for the soul reason that the previous two Britney albums had covers of rock/pop classics on them.<br /><br />While some tracks are more enjoyable than others, even tracks like &#34;Anticipation&#34; and &#34;That's Where You Take Me&#34;, while fluff, are enjoyable fluff. If you are a Britney fan and you don't own this album, this is a must, it is overall, more consistent than her debut album, and at least just as good as her sophmore album, but in a different way. It is a lot of fun to listen to this now and look back and see where Britney's has come from, and possibly why she might have went bonkers for a bit, as you can tell by the amount of tracks about self-assertion, she definitely felt smothered.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amygs range from the thumping and Janet Jackson-esque &#34;Boys&#34; (which is an anthem of sorts) to the the mundane and overdone &#34;Cinderella&#34; and &#34;Bombastic Love&#34;.

B00005OM4N|5.0|19 year old Britney Spears is out with her 3rd Cd titled &quot;Britney&quot;. Every song on this Cd is different. There are different styles of music here like pop, r&amp;b, rock, hip-hop and she even raps on the song called &quot;Boys&quot;. There are 12 songs on this Cd. The best songs are &quot;i'm a slave for you&quot; very r&amp;b driven, Lonely very rocky it's probaly the best song off the album in my own opinion. She even does a cover of Joan Jett's &quot;I love rock 'n' roll which is incredibly awesome. There is even a song written by another one of my favourite singers Dido. It's called &quot;I'm not a girl,not yet a woman, it's a very romantic ballad about Britney growing up. The last song on this disc is written by her boyfriend Justin Timberlake of *NSYNC which is called &quot;What's it's like to be me&quot; it's also a very rock oriented song. You should buy this because you won't regret it. I love her last 2 cds &quot;Baby one more time&quot; and Oops...I did it again but this cd is way better it completley rules. So if you're a die hard Britney fan like me you should definitely pick up this Cd NOW!!!! IT'S THE BEST!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Floyd have issued earlier compilation albums, but not on a double CD. A single LP was never going to do adequate justice to the band, even though they attempted it with the COLLECTION OF GREAT DANCE SONGS.  But no collection could sincerely claim to be the best of the Floyd without including, say, all 23 minutes of 'Echoes', and that blows half an LP right away.<br />This album contains almost all of 'Echoes', together with almost all of almost every other Floyd that one would expect to hear on a 'Best of' collection. I say almost all, because the tracks have been judiciously segued into each other, in most cases just before the fade-out on the original. To some, it may seem sacrilege to interleave DARK SIDE tracks such as 'The Great Gig in the Sky', 'Money', 'Time' and 'Us and Them' with other Floyd classics, but believe me, it works. The only classic which I'm disappointed not to see here is the opening track from OBSCURED BY CLOUDS.<br />There can be few Floyds fans who don't have the classic sequence of four albums from the 70s -- MEDDLE, DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, WISH YOU WERE HERE and ANIMALS. But there may be many who, like me, have never bought a Pink Floyd album on which Syd Barrett played. The early stuff -- for instance, 'See Emily Play', 'Arnold Layne' and the glorious 'Bike' -- has been ingeniously blended into the meld, despite the production standards of the period appearing primaeval compared to Alan Parsons' engineering work on DARK SIDE.<br />It's a wonderful, wonderful collection. I re-purchased my Floyd albums on CD too early -- i.e. before they were re-mastered. The tracks chosen here are from the re-mastered CDs, and it's frankly a relief that I cannot tell the difference in sound quality between these remastered versions and my acoustic memory of my CDs. That's a small fortune saved!<br />The CD inlay booklet is up to the usual Floyd standard, with a cover reminiscent of UMMAGUMMA. We get the lyrics to every song -- I don't believe that all the original LPs disclosed these -- and we get the info on who-played-what.  Floyd have even taken away that second notch on the transparent CD case which makes the inlay booklet so difficult to remove.  This is the early Xmas present you need to give yourself.riginal LPs disclosed these -- and we get the info on who-played-what.

B000059QYB|5.0|Billy Idol just has to be one of the greatest punk/rock acts to come out of the 80's. Who can resist these songs? They are as catchy and as fresh now as they ever were. And this album is packed with such great songs, starting with the great hit, &quot;Dancing with myself&quot; from when he was with Generation X, through to two bonus tracks, a live version of &quot;Rebel Yell&quot; recorded in 1993, and a newly recorded song for this album &quot;Don't you (Forget about me)&quot;, which shows that Billy Idol still has it. The twelve page booklet contains an essay and some photos of Billy.
B00005MP58|4.0|Some parts are overacted, but this is generally a terrific production.  But the color transfer is so poor, pale, and washed out that it looks almost bleached.  The story is engrossing enough that after a time, the viewer grows accustomed, but if the company had any sense of honor, they'd reissue a quality edition and allow trade-ins.

6303942830|5.0|This is one of my top 5 movies of all time.  The musical score is beyond excellent.  The music sets the mood in so many ways, and immerses you in the action.  The scenery is outstanding.  Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent in this movie.  I would reccommend this to anyone.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Don't even try to say this this is just another TEENY BOPPER release for our Generation X kids.I will be the first to correct you that it is NOT.  I myself am in my twenties and I rushed out first thing this morning to get this.  The time waited was well worth it!   This album is definitely geared for not only the youths, but a more mature audience.  I am very impressed by her new style and the message she is getting across. Do not under estimate Miss Britney, this album rocks.  <BR>She proves that she is DEFINITELY not just a little girl anymore.
0743420373|3.0|The Millionaire Next Door was very interesting.  The book tells the reader mainly seven tips in becoming a millionaire.  I think that these tips really could help you in life in making money, but the reason i gave it only 3 stars was I thought the book over generalized who millionaires really are.  I didn't alway agree with how millionaires lived because not all live the way the book says.  But some millionaires do and this book gives people good tips and ideas.  Some of statistics were surprising.  It's a good read.
630469878X|5.0|At a time when \\"buddy movies\\" like \\"Lethal Weapon\\" were all the rage, \\"Thelma and Louise\\" burst on the scene with the radical concept that WOMEN could be buddies too.<br />\\"Thelma and Louise\\" features a literate and ironic script, some beautiful and captivating camera work from director Ridley Scott, and excellent work from Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon as the titular duo.<br />If this film has a flaw, it's that it plays the feminist card a bit too heavy handedly, and tries to make the story of these two women into the story OF women, and I don't buy it. <br />For one thing, you don't HAVE to go on a three-state crime spree and commit suicide to be a strong, independent woman.
B00005QDW5|5.0|It's finally here!!! A complete and actual real greatest hits<BR>package from the Pinks themselves. Hearing Astonomy Domine followed by See Emily Play in its newly remastered digital<BR>excellence is worth the price alone.  Also worth mentioning is the inclusion of When The Tigers Broke Free. Until now never on CD. The CD comes packaged in a slip case and includes a very nice book of lyrics and art work. This is one not to miss.
B00003CXTG|2.0|There's a great debate among film fans these days as to the proper use and place for special effects in films. Too often, it seems that Hollywood films are built around special effects and action sequences, with scenes featuring actors and plot development as filler.<br />No modern filmmaker is more guilty of that than the director of &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; Michael Bay. In all of his previous films (including the excerable &quot;Armageddon&quot;), special effects and action are the point, with human beings tossed in to provide plot references and excuses for sappy Aerosmith ballads.<br />&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is no different. Sure, it takes great pains to be historically accurate, and it even makes an attempt (though a lame one) to create a plot based on human relationships that (gasp) isn't punctuated every ten minutes by something exploding.<br />And that might have worked, had the story not been a banal, poorly written romance between three leads who looked as if they were in it for a paycheck. By the time the attack actually happens, it's as if Bay realized he'd put the audience to sleep and needed a big BANG! to wake them up. <br />In any case, the storyline leading up to the titular attack does little but set up the big-time special effects bonanza we know is coming (and soon, we hope, as Ben Affleck flubs yet another line). <br />Compare that to the far more effective approach of &quot;Titanic,&quot; in which the big-time special effects bonanza (the ship's sinking) actually does nothing but tie up the various plots, relationships, and stories that have been told in the first part of the film. The point of the story is to explore the relationships of the people we meet on Titanic, and the sinking is a part of their story. <br />However, in &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; the point of the story is to get to the big battle sequences, and the stories of people we meet along the way are meant to kill time until we can get until December 7, 1941. Oh, the time is killed stylishly, and the people we watch are shiny and attractive, but not for one moment do we get the sense that they're anything but filler.<br />And that is why this film fails.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|During the middle period of their history (circa 1980-82), Dire Straits (read: Mark Knopler) expanded the scope of their songwriting to a more epic scale.  &quot;Making Movies&quot; is the first of two albums in this vein (the slightly superior &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; is the other).  The album kicks off with the excellent rollicking &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; and then heads off into two first rate story songs &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Skateaway,&quot; the later of the two containing funky grove to with its stretched out lyrical form.  The second half is not quite as strong, though &quot;Expresson Love&quot; and &quot;Solid Rock&quot; are good uptempo tunes.  Overall, &quot;Making Movies&quot; is a transitional album for Dire Straits.  Fortunately for us, it was a good transistion.
B00000JPHG|4.0|This movie was very funny, as opposed to scary. I havent laughed at a movie this hard in a while. My favorite scenes are when Chucky is flipping through the radio channels, commenting on how radio has deteriorated over the years, until he comes across Thunderkiss '65 by White Zombie! Then he says, &quot;That's more like it&quot; and starts rockin'. Another one is when Chucky is making fun of the young couple as they have a mushy conversation. And of course, the sex scene between the dolls. &quot;Do you have a Rubber Chucky? What! I'm made of rubber!&quot; and &quot;I wouldnt date you if you had the body of GI Joe&quot;. There are some great lines here, and I would definately recommend this one to play at your next house party.
B000002KOG|3.0|Neil Young has had a long and glorious career of many soaring highs and a few glaring missteps.  His debut album falls somewhere in between.  Most of Neil's solo work has featured softer folk rock or the loud guitar-laden epics he perfected with Crazy Horse.  This album, while it contains a little bit of both styles, is dominated by almost jazz oriented studio tricks and female backing vocalists, particularly on the catchy but weird &quot;The Old Laughing Lady,&quot; which Neil would do to much better effect nearly a quarter century later on his &quot;Unplugged&quot; album.  &quot;The Loner,&quot; with its sharp guitar bite, anticipates his work with Crazy Horse, while the epic nine-minute opus &quot;The Last Trip to Tulsa&quot; closes the album in suitably strange fashion.  Overall, &quot;Neil Young&quot; is a good album for Young fanatics, but for casual fans I would recommend any one of at least a dozen other Young albums first, starting with &quot;Everybody Knows This is Nowhere&quot; and &quot;After the Goldrush&quot; the two album that immediately followed this one.  Neil only hints at his unique genius on this effort.
014028009X|1.0|I have to say I found this book rather disappointing (the movie was a little better). I picked it up because it was about a single woman like myself, but after I got about halfway into the book I started to feel very alienated. I just couldn't relate to Bridget at all.    I guess this book disturbed me because no one seemed to notice - least of all the author - that Bridget might be an alcoholic and compulsive overeater. Of course, I don't blame her for wanting a man in her life. But I did not find the way Bridget seemed to deal with it by drinking, eating lots of junk food (her diary records the number of calories and \\"alcohol units\\" she consumed each day in nauseatingly tedious detail), and reading trashy self-help books amusing. Instead, it depressed me.     The thing that bothered me most about Bridget was that she appeared to have very little sense of herself. Everybody's opinion of her seemed to count much more than her own; whether they were her corny, busybody Smug Married friends, her idiotic interfering mother, her smarmy, cliche-ishly \\"player\\" boss she was foolish enough to sleep with, or his bitchy yuppie girlfriend.     Normally I'm not a violent person, but I found all those characters so insufferable that I found myself wanting to punch them in the mouth and/or flush them down a toilet. I also felt grateul that these people don't exist in real life, because I was afraid of what I might do to them if they did, and I came across them.    I also kept waiting for Bridget to \\"see the light,\\" realize her own self-worth, and come to the same conclusion about these cretins; maybe at a 12-step meeting or something like that. But it didn't happen, even when she found a boyfriend.    One thing I did like about this book was the British slang and humor. I loved the terms like \\"emotional f*ckwittage.\\"    No doubt I come across as this uptight prude to a lot of people who luuuuv and \\"identify with\\" Bridget. Well, I'm sorry, but I've never found shallow, dysfunctional, stereotypical people interesting.
B00000DGUY|4.0|While a collection of very strong songs, &quot;The Very Best of Dire Straits&quot; emphasizes the wrong part of the band's career.  It contains only two songs from their excellent first two albums, while &quot;On Every Street,&quot; their final and weakest studio album, gets three on its own.  &quot;Down to the Waterline,&quot; &quot;Water of Love&quot; and &quot;Angel of Mercy,&quot; might have been better selections than some of the later stuff.  Truth be told, Dire Straits really needs a box set to be truly appreciated.  They just have too many first rate songs.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This CD is not the best of Britney's work, because alot of the tracks sound like her old songs, just with new words.  But for most people it's like &quot;Hey! It's Britney Spears! Who cares if it's just old stuff with new lyrics?&quot;  But like I said before, it's not her best, but it's still worth purchasing.
B0000248L1|3.0|THis album has an amazing guitarrist in the fomr of the band leader, Jeff Waters. But hes clearly held back by the bad performances of his mates, the singer and the drummer (dont even want to know their names). The drums mixing is dreadful in this album, and the vocals, after the track ALICE IN HELL, are a disgrace. Anyway, this album has a punch that few trash metal albuns have.
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie was great! My family watched it for the first time<BR>last night and we all loved it! My kids are 4 and 3 and have<BR>a short attention span, but this movie had them glued to the <BR>tube and had us all laughing. I definently recommend it to <BR>anyone who has kids as well as anyone who is a kid at heart them-<BR>selves.
B0000042MY|4.0|Im not an expert in soundtracks, have only a handful of them. But I found this one to be very beatutiful and entertaining.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Enrique did and excellent job on this album.  I have all his music and I found this one to be very upbeat.  It is the kind of music that you could clean house with or have it on for a romantic night.  It already has given me a few good nights...<BR>I would recomend this CD to anyone.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears is the undisputed queen of teen pop nowadays, but she's growing up.  Her latest album, the self-titled &quot;Britney,&quot; is proof of that.  The CD is incredible.  Filled with her normal infectious pop with brilliant hints of R&amp;B scattered throughout, there is not one weak track.  &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U,&quot; the opening track and first single, is an exotic-sounding and sexy masterpiece.  Other standout tracks include &quot;Overprotected,&quot; the fun and frisky &quot;Boys,&quot; and the CD's lone ballad, the lush and beautiful (if awkwardly titled) &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.&quot;  There is a surprising rendition of &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll,&quot; and Britney's boyfriend, Justin Timberlake, shows up on the final track, &quot;What It's Like To Be Me.&quot;  All in all, Miss Spears has proven herself to be an essential diva in the world of music and pop culture.
B00005AAFS|5.0|While all the bands seem to be softening their approach or following the trends Rammstein comes out with their heaviest release, and show that there's no need to do all that hip-hop-rap talk and to point your thumbs up and down on and on...\\"Mutter\\" is an execellent album, from beginning to end, there are no lowpoints in this album...The album in general is heavier, and more aggressive, with a lot of anger...The guys found a heavier sound in the guitars, and the drums sound less industrial and electronic, and more direct (you''ll find double pedal-drumm beats, like in \\"Zwitter\\")...Sometimes they sound really punk, like in \\"Adios\\"...\\"Sehnsucht\\" is more danceable and electronic, but the keyboards in songs like \\"Ich Will\\" or \\"Zwitter\\" give them an apocaliptic and metal base... \\"Meinherz Brennt\\" has a cool chorus with violins, and a cool solo (the orchestra appears in more songs). \\"Links 2 3 4\\" reminds me the song \\"Sehnsucht\\" or \\"Du Hast\\". \\"Ich Will\\" is a great track, with terrific keyboards as background and really heavy, with a cool rhythm...\\"Feuer Frei!\\", \\"Adios\\" and \\"Zwitter\\"'s speed remind me \\"Asche zu Asche\\", or even faster...The song \\"Mutter\\" is an example to all the metal bands how a ballad should be done. In \\"Mutter\\" they redefine the word EPIC...In my opinion this is the best Rammstein album. Heavier than the previous two, showing that metal runs through their veins...If I have to pic my faves (that is unfair), I'd stay with \\"Meinherz Brennt\\", \\"Ich Will\\" and \\"Zwitter\\"...<BR>Have in mind that this review was written by a trash, death and black metal fan (lot of metal bands should envy the strength and heaviness of \\"Zwitter\\")...And with this I'm not saying that the faster and heavier the better. I think that Rammstein had a cool and positive change, and it's a relief to find such masterpiece nowadays, with all the .... that is coming out...Rammstein are winners...I recommend this album to any metal fan...
B000002UKS|5.0|I've had this CD for a long time, and it's still my favorite out my whole collection. Foo has a great sound. Not to hard not to quiet. Dave Grohl used to play for Nirvana, but FF is a way more talented band. Get this CD now!
B00005OM4N|5.0|this afternoon i rushed over to the music store to buy this album, i thought gosh i hope it's good! so i buy it, rush home with the treasure in my bag, place it in the CD player, and let's just say it's been playing ever since! I'm a slave 4 u, well i'd already heard it on the radio and when i first heard it i fell in love with it! it's not like britney's other songs, less 'poppy' and more feeling. 'boys' is the same kind. it has a side to it which britney has only just introduced us to. My personnal favourite is 'overprotected', it's perfect for dancing to like a loon (in the privacy of your own bedroom!).'bombastic love' has a latino feeling to it (yet another tune which britney is showing us). then u get the usual slow 1s, such as 'i'm not a girl, not yet a woman'. <BR>well i can't give you all the details really since i'm writing this to encourage you to buy this album, and also to give my own personnal review, and if i told you all the secrets this album holds there won't be any surprise in it for you would there?<BR>so i'll leave you now so you can make your own mind up but keep in mind that this is a fact: this is the best album out of all the others and you obviously liked the others because otherwise you wouldn't be reading more about britney and her fantastic albums!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd takes the listener into a surreal world created by Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, Richard Wright and Syd Barrett. The song selection ranges from the psychedlic Barrett-years to the devine Division Bell era of Gilmour and Co. Though it is hard to pick a greatest hits collection from a group that gave us such opus albums as Dark Side, Wish You Were Here and the Wall. The group has picked a list from classics like Money, Time and Comfortably Numb to such unknown classics like Jugband Blues, Fletcher Memorial Home and Astronomy Domine. And the inclusion of the never-released song on CD of When the Tigers Broke Free. The collection plays as a two seamless sides of a music. This adding to the feel of the music, instead of being chronological. Of course with such songs as Shine On and Echoes some editing was necessary, but the editing is superb. It in no ways affect the feel and overall mood of the songs. The Strom Thorgerson artwork is again amazing, capturing the mood and spirit of Pink Floyd. Also happy hunting in finding all the connections on the covers to the music. The only flaw of this double CD is that I would have liked the packaging to be like the hard-bound Pulse or The Wall Live. I expected just a little more from that. Well go out and get this masterpiece. And hopefully this album willl inspire new fans to go out and get some more Pink Floyd albums that they never heard before. If you do I also recommend Obscured by Clouds which is and &quot;obscure&quot; gem of an album not represented here.
B000002X4T|2.0|A Great album but this cd is poorly recorded and lacks sound quality. I do know that since I do have the original vinyl recording and a later tape. I was horribly disappointed with this cd
B00005OM4N|5.0|SAY HELLO to the new Britney.  She's back and hotter than ever!  This album is awesome, and its definitely her best to date. Britney has definitely come a long way.  Did anyone happen to catch Britney's performance on &quot;Rosie&quot; yesterday?  NO lipsynching, and she sounded great! Perhaps its time that everyone starting taking her seriously as a musical artist...<BR>This album is more R&amp;B than pop, and the results are a success.  Britney sounds better than ever.  There is a little bit of something for everyone here - R &amp; B grooves, ballads, a little bit of disco (Anticipating), and back up by Justin Timberlake. <br />Some highlights:<BR>- &quot;Slave 4 U&quot; is one of the funkiest, groove-worthy songs out there right now with a great beat that makes you just want to get up and dance. <BR>- &quot;Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot; is a beautiful ballad (written by Dido). Britney's voice sounds amazing.  <BR>- &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; is Britney's best cover to date (her other two were &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot;).  Britney keeps the grunting and panting to a minimum and really gets her groove on with this one.<BR>- &quot;What its like to be me&quot; (with JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE singing back-up) is a great note to end the album on.  These two sounds great together. <BR>- &quot;Cinderella&quot; is one of my favorites.<br />Every song on this album is GREAT.  I can go on and on, but I will stop here and I will end here and let you guys enjoy it for yourselves.  Let's send BRITNEY to the top of the Billboard charts!
B00005OLY5|4.0|For light family entertainment you can't do any better. This movie has a nice mixture of fantasy and comedy. If you enjoy movies like Princess Bride, Ladyhawke, or Dragonheart you will like this movie. It has a good cast, beautiful locations, and great special effects. Some very small children may find the two-headed dragon a bit scary, but what good fairy tale have you ever read or seen in a movie that didn't have something scary in it? Even the best Disney films for kids have something scary in them. I was raised on movies like &quot;The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad&quot; and &quot;Jack the Giant Killer&quot; and although the monsters were scary I loved them. But if you find it to scary just cover your eyes like most little kids. The rest of us will open ours in delight at all the wonderful swordplay, magic, and humor. Personally I thought the Brownies were scary with there Sguiggy humor and terrible French accent.

B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney is the best pop singer of her generation and proves it with &quot;Britney&quot;. This album rocks and is a must have for all Britney fans. Apart from the catchy &quot;I'm a slave 4u&quot;, the wonderful ballad &quot;Not a girl, not yet a woman&quot;, this third album features catchy pop songs like &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;Bombastic love&quot;... and much more. But it's more than bublegum pop like her detractors say of her music. <BR>Her cover of &quot;I love rock'n'roll&quot; is a pure rock track...and Britney &quot;did it very well&quot; like Mr Jagger said of her cover of &quot;Satisfaction&quot;.  <BR>The new princess of pop also experiments a bit of rnb but not boring rnb like Destiny's child or their look-alikes produce... it's still pop but tainted of rnb.<BR>Her new sound is what we could call electric pop but it sounds really good.   <BR>Alas... Jive records betrayed all the Britney fans as they removed 3 tracks fro mthe Us track list... &quot;I run away&quot;, &quot;when I found you&quot;,&quot;Before the goodbye&quot;.<BR>As I live In Europe, I could get when I found you on the official cd, and only Japanese + English will get a cd with 14 songs... the 12 of the us version + When I found you and &quot;before the goodbye&quot;.<BR>Anyway, all Us Britney fans... don't panic, the 12 tracks version is GREAT and features the best 12 songs off the album.<BR>A last word to conclude: WELL DONE, BRITNEY!
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is the rare &quot;best-of&quot; title where the included tracks really can be considered the best of the band.  It's a great gift for someone who's just heard of Pink Floyd, and the included rarity &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot; is one of my personal favorites.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Good album of course. Featuring some of the best song and some that s.... It's a good start for new fans; there they'll find which floyd era suits them best. But for long time fans it's totally useless as I guess most floyd fans already have all those songs...except of course for the tigers broke free... <BR>at first i was intrigued with the \\"remixed\\" tracks all fiting together but it's no big deal. just about every floyd song finishes in a fade out so they fade in the following track during the fade out. duh. anyway...till they put out something NEW...
