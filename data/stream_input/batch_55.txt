B00RV417XM|5|A little dissapointed with the fact that they are roughly 5000k white. So dont match my 6000k headlights. But very pleased with function. Brighter than i though they would be.
B000CRMNNS|5|good quality blades.
B007WICLXM|5|Right price right fit
B00S1UIXRI|5|Looks great & very durable!
B001RZC1AE|5|Noticeable difference right after installation. Comes with the grease which I also liked.
B008BWFILU|4|I installed them on my 2003 jeep wrangler and they work well. I installed them in my bumper and connected to an extra switch.  Installation was easy and wiring into my fuse box took me about an hour. This included the soldering so they don't come loose.
B00KLGP4CC|5|Thank you.
B009SX0J88|5|This works great on my bike and GoPro
B004VRLGU6|4|Smell does not last long but it does works.
B003SG431U|4|Great cover for the price, Got this to protect my seats not so much to improve the look. A universal cover got what I expected. 2013 Hyundai Elantra not a perfect fit back head rests covers are to big, no middle headrest cover just left them off. You will lose the back seat arm rest and cup holders, although I'm contemplating taking some slicers and cutting a hole for it, might work. Install took about 2 hours. My arm where to big to fit under the seats, lots of loops to hook together. Simple enough, Just read all the way threw before starting.<br /><br />If I could go back in time. I would have looked into one that was a closer fit, had better padding, and thicker material. Overall happy with how it turned out.
B00C0SQ8KG|1|In the picture and description it saids the brackets come with it and the seller doesn't know what they are selling because they said the bracket doesn't come with it. Not happy at all!
B00GJ1OP00|5|To whom it may concern, these also work on the Honda Hybrid (at least my 2006). I was going to have a mechanic install them but ended up doing it myself to save $90 labor.  Installation was easy enough, impact wrench for the uppers makes it go a whole heck of a lot faster (Torque wrench after you get them in though). Handy trick for the getting the blot through the lower, put a jack under the drum and jack it up till the holes align or are close. Took about 15-20 minutes per side, just remember to tighten everything up before lowering the car back down (that pesky little allen key too!).  If you can do an oil change you can do this to provided you have a jack and jack stands, flat garage or road surface very preferable.<br />BE SURE to take your car to a proper alignment shop afterwards otherwise you will continue to burn tires even if you are a within a hare of perfect. Bring the instructions that come with pack just in case your shop mechanic is a little bit challenged or doesn't work on after market stuff.<br />Very pleased overall. 10/10 would buy again for another Honda.
B008KNJFQE|5|A ok
B004JV6OMO|5|Solved our problem perfectly
B0007RS4BS|5|works great
B00LUS5XLW|4|Fit '02 grand prix, Put about 5,000 on it, works fine.
B0095DMXKS|1|Poop
B00FS9U22Y|5|Installed and works great.  NOT OE, but exact same qaulity.
B0097CKJ58|4|Great antenna and very flexible
B00MJ7P20U|5|Awesome for projects love it
B000KZUZZK|5|This stuff sticks to glass pretty good. Didn't have any issues.
B00U0KG5Z4|4|fast shipping. works fine
B00CZC293W|4|good stuff
B00U1PAVB2|3|These clamps are definitely not designed for a mid-size or larger truck or suv even if they do fit around the coils.<br />However, I will say that they seemed to be quality enough for cars, small truck &amp; suv's.
B002JFQFNA|5|for the price you cannot get a better pair of sunglasses
B000B6CVZU|4|Worked Fine on my 99 Silverado although you cannot use the original nut when installing cause the nut had a built in washer and it would not fit in the  slot provided on the part , so i had to go buy a 5/16 bolt without washer and even then it was tight getting the socket in there to tighten it
B001DRH4JO|5|Perfect
B008LZLYSS|3|Very good...
B00VSCQPNU|4|Good except the holes looked worn out
B00545N4IG|5|great stuff but spendy
B00RC50ORA|1|not good
B0051D3MP6|5|Works as it should have!
B00KTIUG5C|5|As described, work great!  And came with battery.
B00Q587KXG|4|Love the case so far they work great . don't have to be close makes jumping easyier.<br />  Thanks again<br />  Tocoolruhl's roadside services.
B000BZ6NZU|5|Good quality and fit.... the only issue was the attachment bolts supplied did not work with my wiper arms so I just used the ones I already had. 95 Challenger 313 motorhome.
B0030VIR2O|5|It fits like factory! My original filler bezel was cracked, and this fit like a charm. I wish it had come with hardware, but luckily, as I have a jeep, I know my way around a hardware aisle!
B001D23XJY|1|Wrong sized item. Did not fit my car.
B0037DD3RO|5|Still using it today
B00IX5MM9G|5|First of all let me say WOW. At first I had my doubt's. Would they even work, will they look cheap? How difficult will the install be? Just to name a few ?. I can proudly say they look GREAT (In my Tony the Tiger voice). Really the install was a total of 4 minutes for both of them. Super easy, they look and feel better then the OEM lights they replace. I have them on my Blue Volkswagen Passat, what's really nice is that the projected Volkswagen logo is Blue. Almost the same color of my car. It's like these were made for my car. What a great company to buy from. You guys made me happy, the only logo's I use and need is the Volkswagen ones.
B005G82C8E|5|I love it
B0054HNQ32|5|Very useful, ratchet straps are not always the best fit for the tie down job. Good quality.
B000C5HQXC|1|worked
B009YRI64C|5|Easy to apply to car window. Looks great.
B000VKRQEM|5|Turning on our A/C in our recently purchased 2013 Golf was making a foul smell. Replaced the air filter and did the trick. No more bad smell from A/C vents. This filter is not as easy to replace in a Golf as in other vehicles, I suggest searching in YouTube which is what I did. But other than that the filter worked.
B00KTIZK30|5|Easy online instructions to set remote.
B00U5U10AY|1|Didn't fit not worth returning!
B006N9F46M|5|Perfect. Had a clunkinging sound in front end for several years, Finally discovers the original bushings were loose. Under $10 fixed my problem!
B00IJYEDYI|5|A great replacement for the barrel springs that came with my solo seat kit. Great springs.
B002EAL1VG|5|Works great! I've had my Polaris SL750 Triple out 3 times now and no problems. Installed all new fuel lines without having to remove carbs. This is definitely the way to go to prevent lean condition associated piston damage for these old 'skis.
B00B21R0TA|1|Its a s***, the worst lens.<br /><br />I want my money back
B0017OCGZK|5|Worked as expected! I recommend & will purchase again for other applications!
B00EKKJ9E4|5|Great light if it doesn't fit the socket you may just have to grind down the outer rim a bit.  Did that on mine and in went right in.  Highly recommend it.
B000CPJJUA|4|I installed the brake lines on my 1993 NA Miata they fit ok and the quality seams to be good .<br />the front lines are about 1.5&#34; longer then the stock rubber lines .<br />the banjo fitting doesn't have the same bend as the OE line it doesn't hit the wheel even though it's bent at more of a angle but the line is close to the inner part of the rim .<br />they are worth buying !
B00PQ2AXMC|5|ill be ordering more for sure
B00FG4NBMO|4|Painted & installed mirror as necessary, wiring harness OK, minor chaff/plastic overrun, trimmed as needed. Matched other mirror perfectly.
B000C5DUN2|3|these were a perfect fit for my 1999 Explorer sport.  The cruise doesn't work but at least they covered up the gummy & ugly stubs left by the last switch delaminating.
B0041U918M|5|Great replacement part, at a much lower price than oem.  I had to switch the bulbs for the turn signal and back up lights; they came reversed. Fits great!
B008UFPROG|5|It fits perfectly. No cons.
B00C4H2YXI|5|The exact OEM match. Received item within 4-5 days
B002DJ2U1S|5|Great buy - why spend a fortune on the &#34;name brand&#34; when these look just as great!
B00D9C2CDO|2|Made a 950 mile trip from NC to the UP of Michigan.  Driving there it seemed like all was well, I loaded pretty full and the wind noise was minimal.  When I got to Mich and unpacked the bag the front seam wore down to the mesh under fabric and I can see daylight through it.  Luckily we didn't hit any rain storms.  I duct taped the seam for the trip home.  The straps were great but the fabric didn't hold but to the wind for me.
B00V9252VU|5|Perfect kit for the right price
B004K9EPYE|5|Great pump. Put this on my 2006 660 rhino and it fit perfect. I was having problems with the motor getting enough fuel at higher speeds so I put this newer updated pump on with a new fuel filter and now it runs great. As always great shipping.
B00HYHTD50|5|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT this is the best seat belt extended ever. It does everything just like it said. I am very happy with this purchase!!!!
B002N5DE2G|5|Arrived quickly, a good assortment.
B00L6F04U4|4|as advertised
B00317BMOC|5|Improved the cooling on my 08 kfx450 and is very nice quality
B000GU0PQ8|5|Work nice on my 84 cr250
B00HNMHQB4|1|Not that good only lasted 3 months stop working
B011B25IXY|5|I have used it once as I recieved it only yesterday. It holds a lot of soapy water very well which is key to not scratching dark colored cars. It seems like it has a soft texture to minimalize scratching. (It replaces a boars bristle brush that really scratches.I used it about a week before I realized the damage. Painful since I paid $83 for something that wouldn't scratch).The quality of materials and construction seem to be excellent.Reviews of this type of wash mitt say that they do not hold dirt which is a problem with wool mitts.Talk to me in a month and I will be able to tell you better.
B000VBAGB6|4|I bought them as a gift for my sister we just put them in they fit great and look wonderful
B00TRA4YZQ|5|A bit darker than I expected, but looks great regardless!
B00LCFKRSC|5|The product arrived on time and they look great on my wife's car. She is very pleased.
B00BNXPAIA|5|Comes in hand in small spaces when the slide hammer is too big.
B00WTJOF1U|5|Slapped these tiny lights onto my big old ford stood in front of it and it's like this. . . One light makes you go wow! Two lights makes you go hell yea! Three makes you go enough! Four is ok kill the lights I'm freaking blind now! Damn!
B003BZD06M|5|fit just like I hope it would.
B0041388UG|5|Installed easily. Really don't need the instructions for it. I decided to move it further left once it was on my camper and it took less then 5 minutes to remove the tire and slide the tire holder down.
B00QMWQQBW|1|There is nothing Deluxe about these. They are as thin as paper and act like velcro. I have a large vacuum that can't get bits of grass etc out of them because they hold onto it. A couple months after owning them the reinforced part of the driver's side mat peeled apart along the ridges of the rubber.
B011QXQ8D2|5|Extremely bright.  I mean it.  I was going to use them as DRL lights on my Jeep Wrangler, but they're as bright as full-voltage high beam headlights, too annoying to other drivers.  Maybe the 4-LED version (in flood, not spot) would have been better.  But for reverse lights, they would be great!
B004RNR9BY|5|Perfect hose for my needs
B001GF5H4C|5|Very good quality covers and much easier to install than the common bungee cord types.  No crawling around on your hands and knees to fish the cord around the tire. Much easier to work with.  Material seems to be high quality.  Will know how good in a few years.  So far, I'm pleased and would recommend these covers.
B000AMLWH8|2|Performs and smells exactly like vinegar and water. Had to buy another product to get rid of the smell :(
B00R8LJY38|4|Works as advertised vacuum Stella system in nothing flat.
B0009IK5QC|5|Anco blades clean well and last a long time. Very convenient because you can find the right size easily.
B000WJX29U|1|I've had poor experience with non- Yuasa motorsport batteries so I've typically bought this brand over the last 5 years. This one died after only 8 months. It completely shorted out, it appears from heat damage.
B00DC95OJ8|4|I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not include the plastic pop rivet needed to fasten the cap lanyard to the car.  However, a nylon zip tie is a good substitute for the pop rivet. My '06 Porsche Cayman S displayed a Check Engine Light.  My code reader displayed the alarm as &#34;P0455  Evaporative Emission System Leak Detected.  Gross Leak or No Flow Confirmed&#34;.  Because it was easy to do, I used a paper towel to wipe down the gas cap gasket and the fuel tank filler neck.  Then I deleted the code to extinguish the CEL to see if the problem returned. The Check Engine Light soon returned but this time the code was &#34;P0456  Evaporative Emission System Leak (very small leak) CONFIRMED&#34;.  Inspection of the cap gasket with a flashlight revealed several small radial cracks in the gasket. Wiping down the gasket & filler neck with a cloth wet with silicone spray sealed the leak for the several days it took for this new cap to arrive.
B00LMM7256|5|Installed this on a 2015 Outback 3.6.  Instructions from Subaru were accurate and very easy to follow.  Total install time was 30 minutes.  My only additional comment about the install is to be gentle after pulling down the console, it is attached to wires that wrap around the foam block that is mentioned in the instructions.  The foam block is very fragile and can be broken easily.  The connector for the mirror is right next to/behind the foam and is most easily accessed/seen from the passenger seat using a headlamp/flashlight.<br /><br />Instructions:  http://techinfo.subaru.com/proxy/76808/pdf/076808-h501sal100.pdf
B002VF8284|5|Worked perfectly.  I changed the filter myself, and while that was a hassle, I saved myself $70!  Once I got the old filter out, this one was a breeze (ha) to install.  Would definitely purchase again.
B000GU1ZFS|1|Used  for about 2 weeks everyday before all the keys would not unlock it. Luckily I was at work with cutting tools to cut it off my bike.
B00M78820I|5|Nice product for the price.  Car still gets extremely hot, then again i live in South Florida...worth it simply for the fact my toy (mint condition 1988 Honda CRX) will keeps its crack-free dash for many more years!
B00CJFLOJU|5|Buy these for your n54. The other ones on amazon are a scam. These are legit for pushing the car on your fbo + tune.
B004XG3MJ8|4|Make sure you get a d ring big enough, a 1/2 or a 1 in is not big enough
B00VE39A12|5|Great support team!
B000XJEZVI|1|I received only one spark plug and the ad says they're 4 units. I felt I was cheated
B00P9EJGR0|5|Exactly what I was looking for. The product was very easy to install, it fit perfectly my Toyota Corolla (snug fit and not bulky). I can't imagine how dirty my seats will be without this.
B00G93RFZU|5|Love!
B001BK49S2|3|These mirrors were an exact replica of the OEM right down to the grain in the plastic and the lettering and symbols. Closest thing I've found next to the factory parts. Update- 2 years  later and the chrome has started to bubble on the outside.
B001ABPKUS|5|they did the job while we had that truck. they need to find a new home now
B00BNRQU4E|5|Son loved the shirt
B001KML9D4|5|We absolutely love this tray. It's perfect for our jet-ski trips. It's a nice size - not too large and heavy to lift out easily, but still big enough to hold quite a bit of stuff.
B000KL8QUK|3|It was damage
B000Q71N8K|1|not great for camping which is why we were interested as there is no way to keep it going without killing your battery and if it's really hot where you are going the food would spoil
B003M9FZFG|4|They fit the car perfectly. Only downside was the edges were sharp in spots causing some cuts
B000EAIERW|5|perfect for my cj7 i have a full cage in it
B00FXKZHVO|5|Works great. Easy to install. Just have to wrench it on tight
B00EF3P63O|4|The directions were la title difficult but I figured it out.  And I don't know what I did wrong but I had to get longer screws for the front panel.  I also sprayed the rack with black bed liner to cover the scratches it came with a prevent rust that I had read in other reviews. I am happy with it!
B00KN6L8G6|3|one blew out on me already
B002E3FXB2|5|Great hitch, easily installed.  Solid construction.  Exactly what I needed.
B00CIJPU74|5|My boyfriend loved it! Thank you!
B000E63MAA|5|Perfect fit... Arrived quickly
B00LCDM89K|5|Somewhat flexible/stretchy which is actually good when you're out of practice putting these things on bikes... and unless you really suck at putting these on bikes, then you are probably out of practice also or you'd be.. you know, putting these on bikes over and over... because you're not good at it.
B001MU5LNS|5|Replacement spark plugs for 2010 Mazdaspeed3. The factory spark plugs are custom and you can't buy direct from NGK they have just a slightly smaller gap. Used these for my 60,000 mile service. Make sure you check the gap before install as I had one that was out of spec likely from shipping. Would recommend to others.
B00CLMBE5A|5|works greaT
B003TTL0TE|5|Here is Seattle after a rain, grime just builds up on your car.  My other mitt would trap all the dirt and it was very difficult to remove.  This mitt the grime just falls off in my rinse bucket!  A+  Super soft also!
B002PQUA8Y|5|They came on time and functioned as advertised.. was very pleased.
B000CB7ALY|5|As advertised.
B00478EHE6|5|Great product, very satisfied!!!
B00KQ81M94|1|Buy the Absorber instead of this. It's superior in every way. This towels like using paper towels to dry your ride. I use these towels almost every day and the man chams a scam
B00FJW62WE|5|As advertised!
B001DI059Y|1|Cheap and didn't work.
B00802FFA0|5|Very good light
B0025272PW|5|Perfect!
B00DNISOZE|1|I've had the seat covers in my vehicle for a week, and they are already falling apart. Do not waste your money on them.
B00WS50HZI|5|Was easy to fit and is reallyyy brite
B00YMUAIU6|5|NIB.  As advertised
B01136VF0S|3|Very thin material Jhansi a cheap feel to it and definitely runs smaller than expected
B00LSDUSSW|1|It did not fit on my car
B00X4UG88Q|5|This was a perfect match for my 2015 Honda Accord. But I guess I will have to glue the caps on.
B00OL4N56C|5|Great product
B00PNUIKDG|4|Good substitute. Bought this as it was $40 cheaper then fron the dealer. Works just like the original. Hope it last longer then the original.
B000UK0AKU|5|Perfect fit for my Yamaha Zuma. Happy customer.
B00A3HO9CA|5|Fast service and works good
B00M1X6F9Y|5|very good .  I would recommend it
B00T1718H2|5|Awesome LEDS! Super bright, and easy to install!
B000JZZ6ZU|5|Worked like new
B004UPZXQM|5|This is an all-purpose product that does great things.  I spray on the weatherstrip to protect it, spray it on the paint, luggage rack, etc.  Previously, any sealants I used on the weatherstrip had to be kept off of the paint, this one goes anywhere.  It makes it really easy to keep my vehicle's exterior looking new. I will definitely buy again.
B006OMCU6A|5|perfect fit and seems to work fine
B000CAZ5DK|5|Purchased this For My Subaru Impreza,Was Very Pressed By Tje Fit,Quality And. ,Price,A Very Good Brand And I Highly Recommend This
B00EE23VA6|4|There's a small Metal piece to hold the battery. My original one does not have the same part. I made it work though.
B004FPABG4|5|Looks great on wife's RAV4!
B0097IECXM|5|Worked perfectly  deliveredon time
B00UYMRNOU|1|I replaced these with cubes. The cheapo cubes were much brighter than this could ever be.
B009DK6CQO|5|Everything was excellent thanks so much
B009JC8SFE|4|worked fine as expected
B005CT9CYO|5|Awesome Perfect fit. I bought a different brand that did not fit. Spend the extra money it's worth it
B001IH8PPQ|5|Needed something for F150 to hook trailer chains to.
B005XDOV9A|3|It works. It is just SUPER hard to lift up.
B000NP3EOG|3|They look great. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is there is a small defect in the brake pedal. It's not enough for me to return them.
B008ILVLD8|5|Excellent piece of equipment
B000C5YD4W|5|Fixed my check engine light problem. It's been 2 months since I installed it myself. Took 5 minutes. Excellent product
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Very Good Light Thanks.......
B000IYABFM|5|Worked like a charm, exactly what I needed.
B000I0TWB0|4|I'm really pleased with this purchase.  The cover looks good and was relatively easy to put on.  There are several videos on Youtube showing the whole process.  My Ford Sport Trac was slighly different in that if has a full bed liner and the normal clamp system would not have worked.  Instead the company provided custom mounting brackets for mounting on the bed liner.  One guy in a video says something about installing it in 8 minutes.  Don't believe that.  I had to put it on and off 3 times before I got the alignment and tension just right.  Allow a couple of hours.  One small problems was that the bolts for mounting on my truck were of the wrong thread and wouldn't go in the holes.  I just used the screws from my previous cover and had not problem.  Another feature I like is the easy tension adjustment which I'll have to do when the weather changes.
B007PJ4A32|4|The independent seller was quick to ship and deliver the product. It arrived sooner than estimated.<br /><br />The light smoke shield is great. It's not too dark where you can barely see anything but combined with the smoked drop-down visor it gets plenty dark.<br /><br />I also like the light smoke over the clear because it doesn't show all the smudges and moisture build up when looking through it. Great face shield, great seller.
B0002MG5M8|5|Exactly as described and showed up when it was supposed too. Would recommend them and have.
B001A3EPHU|4|Great service, great product. This is my 3rd UV-2000 they last for years, but in the summer heat here in Tucson everything eventually breaks down.
B00M9PDUQA|4|Not that bright but does the job
B003SFSI26|5|Great! All as described and fast shipping
B00LG07MZE|1|Broke as soon as I tried to fold it back up (following the directions)!
B004MDEV38|5|Easy to install. My van already had all the threaded holes in the frame for hitch. It is very high and is easily hidden. My wife was worried that it was going to be an eyesore, but she was even pleased. It also arrived ealier then projected which saved our camping trip.
B000ZAS5GG|5|Great fit and durable. I love them and would highly recommend these.
B007V743PS|5|it is exactly what we wanted
B004QU2REW|5|Sticker is great. Could have supplied directions on proper application. I've had experience with this type of decal before but someone who hasn't may need a bit of guidance.
B005MZYNGK|5|Stuck well through various weather. Aldo Gabe my Co workers something to prank me with. They would move it to a different spot at the end of my shift lol so yes it's move able.
B00RXXLJGG|5|Good quality and looking lumbar support
B004EK0E5S|5|Easy to order<br />excellent service<br />item was just what we wanted. High 5 along with the 5 stars
B00HJ15AJ4|5|Looks great on my car!
B00JK322MW|4|These jumpers cables will absolutely work for what you need them for. Upon first glance they look pretty basic but I do like that they added the reinforced clamps on the newer models. This may only be true depending on which GAUGE you purchase but they definitely make you feel secure in jumping your vehicle. Obviously my car battery wasn't dead to test the product, HOWEVER my neighbor had a Chevy Impala with a dead battery so this is what I can base my experience from.<br /><br />Performance:<br />- Reinforced clamps secure very quickly to a top or side post battery<br />- the LENGTH of these cables are the big selling point<br />- Delivers sufficient power to jump/charge a car/truck battery within 5 minutes (Once again, depending on which GAUGE of these wires that you buy) I tested it with the 8 & 6 gauge<br /><br />- Upon connecting the two vehicles, we got his 2005 Impala started within 6 minutes ( 6 gauge wires)<br /><br />Other Tips:<br /><br />-The travel bag is a GREAT thing to have. Unfortunately, you may not feel like wrapping it all up again after you finish using some 12-16ft wires lol. I do appreciate the bag though.<br /><br />- IF YOU HAVE A BIGGER VEHICLE(Truck)/BATTERY I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY THE 4 GAUGE MODEL....MAYBE THE 6 GAUGE MODEL. STAY AWAY FROM THE 8-10 GAUGE MODEL UNLESS YOU HAVE A COMPACT CAR OR NORMAL SEDAN.<br /><br />- If you get a higher gauge wire for big trucks, the cables should still work but you will find them heating up VERY quickly and taking a while to charge the battery before a spark is capable.<br /><br />Areas for Improvement?<br /><br />- Like I was saying, the higher # of the gauge = the thinner the wires will be thus will take more time<br />- The 8 and 6 gauge models still come with the Copper Plated Clamps which do not last as long as solid copper clamps.<br /><br />Would I recommend these?<br /><br />YES, these are great wires for the price. Like I listed above, as long as you buy the correct gauge for your application then you cannot go wrong. They posted a chart to show you the recommended gauge for your vehicle. Don't buy a 10 gauge wire then give a bad review when it does not instantly jump your semi truck lol....seriously. I received these cables for a slight discount in exchange for my GENUINE review. You can be certain that I gave you the nitty gritty before you possibly purchase these cables.pplication then you cannot go wrong. They posted a chart to show you the recommended gauge for your vehicle. Don't buy a 10 gauge wire then give a bad review when it does not instantly jump your semi truck lol....seriously.

B00L2I7EOE|5|Good very good
B000ALIRMW|5|it fit and was easy to install.<br />Good price & on time delivery
B00OK7SDVM|5|super item. 5 min to put on.
B006X6N4QW|5|Perfect
B003XGYDE2|5|I love this thing and it saves me countless trips to the service station and/or quarters to re-inflate my tires.
B000CF6S2C|5|Very good quality right up there with best. Easy install
B00DQJ8T00|5|Screws right in place of factory antenna on 2014 JK. Reception is the same as before, at least where I am located 5 miles east of Philadelphia. Based on prior experiences with aftermarket antennas, I put a dab on anti-seize on the threads just to be safe. Looks awesome!!!
B00DHVODMK|5|Its a very awesome looking bell i bought it for a buddy of mine to keep him safe on his travels looks great an comes with a little story about the guardian bells
B00AJLY628|4|Bully Dog no longer makes model 40430 for the Hemi. Instead received 40417 as its equivalent replacement plus cash since that model is available at a cheaper price. So far so good on the tuner. Installed easily with zero issues.
B00COOR526|5|Perfect
B000X3DEGQ|5|great brake pads!!!  great stopping power, extremely low dust, and no noise...the sensors fit perfectly...will definitely buy these pads again.
B00JN1TEJ0|1|NOT leather. DID NOT fit without serious modifications. You can disregard all of the other feedback. They've got to be lying or it's fake feedback. The plastic trim piece wasn't even close to being correct. I had to tear the thin plastic coated fabric, not leather, material off of the cheap plastic frame, which was just glued on, and staple it to the OEM frame. The molded plastic knob is a throwaway also. Probably the last time I buy auto parts from Amazon. Vendors description and quality can't be trusted. Buying from ECS Tuning from now on.
B0090149R0|5|arrived on time, new condition as described, working well
B00WYKYAHS|5|I must say, the big thirsty is by far my favorite waffle weave towel. I own four other waffle weave towels and this one is the most impressive. I have over forty other microfiber towels(standard,not waffle weave) and the BIG THIRSTY is still my personal favorite.
B000P7O5DG|5|It works like you think it should.  It does get pretty warm but it's not enough to be concerned about.  It's not too hot to handle.
B00BCRMB34|4|This is a complete steps of 17 pieces containing  (2) 3pc Bucket Set, (1) 2pc Bench set, 1 Bench Bra for 50/50 or 60/40 split bench option, 5 Head Rest, 4 Safety Seat-Belt Pad Protectors, 1 Steering Wheel Cover. Overall I am happy with my purchase and lucky this fit my style and model of my car. I know that there are some cars this will not fit, so please research before you buy to avoid problems.<br />It makes my car look new and classy. I never had a set of seat covers in my car before and with three children that was a mistake. I was able to cover up spills and stains that I have never been able to clean up or remove.<br />This is easy to install.<br /><br />Note: I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest option.
B0075VGTUW|4|Just a glitch with one I ordered previously but ordered another and was promptly refunded for the one that didn't work.
B00WQHMMVK|4|came with a small tear, but functional  and just the size that was needed
B0082365AQ|5|This is so simple and well engineered.  It works, it's sturdy, compact and the price is hard to beat.  This is a no brainer, if you need cart for your canoe or kayak, buy this one!
B000RDG7OI|5|Great fit well and passed inspection!
B001AZS5KG|1|Nice looking but fell off the truck and lost it in one day the sticky stuff on the back is terrible will not hold the plate on do not buy waste of money
B002ZS4QCS|5|MAXSA Innovations 20057 Mini Hooks, set of 2. These are so handy! Keeps my purse out of sight in the back seat. Purse is still easy for me to get to, but not so visible or tempting for passersby. I have only had them a few days, but I totally recommend these hooks. I saw something similar in Groupon for 3 times the price, plus shipping. I appreciate Amazon, being able to shop, compare, and get the best deal for my situation.
B00ESBOL3E|2|Not happy with this light it's bright just don't have the distance I was hoping for I have a 20&#34; light that puts out just as much light.. you get what you pay for I guess...
B00068OL1A|2|Wasn't thick, and didn't last (I used it on my bathroom sink).
B00450FLAU|1|A waste of money. It broke the second time it was used. Cheap rubbish.
B003YI421I|5|Product works like magic
B00KLKE1RW|4|They were cheap replacement parts. .my expectations weren't too high.  However the front and back of the cases didn't fit together properly without a little &#34;file to fit&#34; applied to them.  Fortunately I have good tools available to me and was able to make everything snap together in a few minutes. I think it'd been a 5 star rating of I didn't have to modify them before they snapped together.
B00B02NU9K|1|Used it for a 2000 mile trip and it opened while driving on the freeway.  One bag blew out and was run over by traffic.  Lost about $800 worth of stuff.  Luckily it did not cause an accident.  The metal bracket on the lower side was broken in two places.  I was amazed because we previously drove through a 2 hour heavy rainstorm and was impressed that the only minimal water got in and the deep ribs in the floor kept everything dry.<br /><br />Need to use straps to keep closed.  I only saw one other one on the road with extra straps.  They must have had the same experience we did.  Luckily I had some ratchet straps I always keep in the car.
B00N8L0WMO|4|Suction cups don't stay put.
B0051D3MP6|5|Bought 1, liked it so much I bought 2 more as gifts for friends.
B000NJ60BQ|5|Great Strap. Nice that it came with replacement bolt also.
B00HLPPZJS|5|Very good wish they tucked in closer
B00X4S6J5A|2|Cheap looking and very thin. But fun design.
B000BOAX1G|5|Best blind spot mirrors! Does whatever you need it to. Sticks on and stays on. Great for changing lanes and parking!
B003X93N40|5|Good product
B000CN9CPE|4|always like energy suspension products, make sure of all measurements before you order.
B004ZF3KA8|5|If you want nighttime driving to look like daytime, these are what you need. I've driven over a million and a half miles with a great majority of those being at night and have never had anything come close to comparing with them. (You don't need driving lights if you have these)
B002AQWK5K|5|I got this to hold my camera equipment on a ride to Mt. St. Helens. We rode 913 miles and it never slipped or acted like it wanted to fly away. It's very well built and I loved the clear pocket on top for my tablet. By the way, the tablet touch screen worked great through the clear vinyl. Great tank bag!
B00C5RB03W|5|A perfect fit. Price was excellent.
B005C5FD4G|5|worked great on my 05 ttr 125
B00XQP995S|5|Very good parts i can rebuilt my turbo.
B001VJZO2S|4|I bought this to check the PSI on my tires every now and then. It works pretty well. I feared that it would leak air due to a bad seal as mentioned in other reviews, but this seal looks legit. It uses a CR2032 battery that you can change if it goes bad (but it shouldn't for a long time). It does keep the PSI readout on the screen for a few seconds, just in case you have to raise it up to view it better. The only thing I would suggest for this gauge is a little pin or something that I could use to let some excess air out. Other then that, its a pretty handy gauge.
B001DKOZ84|3|Not sure where the new noise is coming from, maybe an ideler bearing
B008G1Z3J8|4|well packaged and delivered on time.  fits nice and looks great.
B000IBHK0O|5|It was a gift for my father in law, fit his car perfectly
B0065G36WW|5|Great Chain!
B000C19DNM|5|I installed this on my 2012 F150 Platinum, it worked great with no adjustment or modification, some reviewers stated they needed to add washers, my unit came with 2 washers and the instructions said where to use them. There are a lot of comments on the wiring. I can tell you that on my truck on the drivers side the wire colors in the direction were correct, but I found more than 1 wire with the colors listed. The thicker one were the correct ones to use about the same gauge as the ones with the Pop & lock.
B007FGFUPC|5|I had a little issue putting this on my car so it has a few bubbles. I love it anyway.
B00RLGB2IA|3|Good solid grip. Pretty hard but looks like it will hold up. All in all not bad for the price. Look cool!
B0010DXYHW|5|Purchased the Fram Extra Guard Air Filter for my wife's 2012 Toyota Camry after Jiffy Lube wanted over $40.  The delivery took a little while, just over a week.  But the filter fit great and saved me over 30 bucks!  Great deal!
B003B08YM2|5|I bought these as a gift, my dad loves them.
B003SZW0PW|5|Good price and good fit
B00809YANG|5|fits perfectly in Honda fit
B00AC6Y9S6|5|I bought this for my daughter...She raves about it!!!  This cargo bag has enough room to take on a trip for a week, it is well made and can be used as a carry-on if ou happen to be flying, as it meets the size specs for the airlines...  Great bag!!!
B001OCXCR6|4|Well made unit. Had to return the first one due to some rust and it didn't sit level. Return was a pain because they don't pay for any return shipping, so I had to haul it to UPS.  Due to size and weight, both shipping boxes were damaged upon receipt so units were slightly scratched.  But I did keep it. I like the fold up hinge!
B002TN0DKI|5|The fit was as stated. There is no noise or dust so far. Only 200miles sofar
B00JL7Y8MY|3|these are o.k., my complaint is that the rubber steps aren't long enough, they should be the length of the step, especially when you exit the vehicle you tend to step on the bar, and the black finish is getting scratched, as i like to keep my truck looking good, i may replace these in the near future..
B009CNYJG2|5|I have used this product without problem,I love it.I recommend it.
B008MISDGU|5|Great oil for my Honda motorcycle. The price is even better when compared to local stores.
B00AZ4SPJO|3|quality was not what i was expecting. but overall it was ok
B000TYLIFS|5|Great product.<br />My truck runs like new
B009S31VVW|5|As ordered.  Easy to install after watching internet video.
B007KA7PP6|5|This starter fit perfectly and was a great price.
B00UO6HP9Y|5|Love it so far. Much better quality then the StarLite I had that died.
B010VUKDJQ|5|Fit 2012 Electra Glide Limited perfectly.
B0091I1Q4Q|5|This will help keep my batteries charged at the cabin.
B0076AU0YS|5|This part was exactly what I needed at a very low cost, I am completely satisfied.
B00GWFKNQI|5|This may is awesome. So much softer and more pliable than the weathertechs. I have the weathertechs front liners for my 2015 Sierra Denali and these are much nicer. I am returning the weathertechs and purchasing the husky x-act front liners as well. I am super happy with this purchase and got a smoking deal at $70 on Amazon!
B0040CX2FY|4|The socket worked great for my 2001 Chevy S10.  The only thing that would have made it better would be to include some watertight crimp connectors to make the wire termination easier.  I ended up soldering it in since I have the stuff handy to do so.
B00OSZ2N08|5|This is a great item for any vehicle! I put mine on the middle headrest of my ford explorers second row seat, so facing the 3rd row. Easy to install and super sleek. Not in the way of the 3rd row passengers but easy to access for 2nd and 3rd row passengers! My sister in law saw it and requested one for her birthday! Could not be happier!!
B00BG6IJA0|5|Nice wide base and low height. Great buy.
B00H7O165A|5|Quality far exceeded my expectations. These are good solid screws - easy to adjust so emblem is upright.
B00E9CZLF4|5|I put this sticker on my Ford Escape and it turned into Optimus Prime, no lie!
B000CSOM8G|1|First one I orde just lasted a few days so ordered another ome
B000KYQZBY|5|This is far more economical than going to a locksmith or dealer for a replacement clicker. I followed the programming instructions in my car owner's manual, which were a bit clearer than the ones that came with the clicker. Note that you must use another working clicker in order to program the new one! (Used with a 2000 Dodge Grand Caravan.)
B003H6R9G2|5|Great exhaust love it i would recommend this product to anyone
B000BRF3VS|5|I installed one in the bed room in our RV, then I decided  installed a second one replacing a vent in the living room area and very happy with the results.<br /><br />Paul
B009AQS5JS|5|exactly as expected.
B004I0IEP6|5|Very well done, German engineering, no tools needed. Thanks to everyone who was involved here from the first and the last one.
B000CNBQ12|5|They are stiffer then my originals  but they were wore out. 2.5&#34; lift became 4&#34; because they were so wore out. In the end the rear sits 1.5 higher on my 04 F350. Which is good when i put a load in there it wont sit funny. Gave plenty of clearance for 33x12 tires. I think i can get 35&#34; tires on there, ill find out when these ones wear out.
B00PUTF8MQ|5|Let's bad ass in front of my truck
B00WFJ5GOE|2|Manual was advertised as covering years 2002 to 2012, however it only went to 2006.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Good product
B002NBOWI0|5|Exceeds my expectations.  Great product for a good price.
B000CPCBEQ|5|Finally got around to changing the trans oil in my Nissan Hardbody 4x4, should have done it as soon as I got the oil. Night and day difference in the shifting of the transmission. It is a lot smoother on the movement now.
B005ZWM0R4|4|For someone with a lot of past experience with automobiles a big chunk of the readouts did not make sense. I'm not sure if its me or the ODB software. Probably me. The software loaded into my laptop easily, the plug fit the car effortlessly and reset the code easily enough. I thought the light was bogus and after reseting it, the light never came back on. It paid for itself right there. I didn't have to visit a mechanic.
B00187Z1R6|3|fits great, as expected, but seems really cheap. i hope i don't crash in it because i'm not sure how it would hold up.
B007VRBH8E|5|Great toe gauge.  Works perfectly!  Thanks Jegs!
B00JLJV1ZO|5|Great easy to put on and good $$$$
B001J63ILW|5|This was a real improvement in idle smoothness and power.
B005FL63HS|5|Great value
B00GUBOOAA|5|Much needed.
B00N25H7B0|4|2013 GMC Acadia SLT W/o factory tow package. This fit this vehicle exactly to the factory harness. EASY install, most difficult part of install is to gain access to factory harness and remove it from frame mount, otherwise a breeze. My total install time 30 minutes. A+++
B000BPSW7C|1|I bought nu finish from from Amazon in May 2015. I used it once on the hood of my 2010 Black Altima 2.5s. It was easy to rub on but I found it extremely hard to rub off. I was not happy with the dull way it looked. My finish now looks terrible but only in that initial half of my hood. It was so hard to rub off that I have given up. Now I only want to return the product but it is beyond 30 days and I cannot return it to Amazon. I went to the Nu Finish web site and could not find their customer service. Maybe I didn't try hard enough to buff and polish the Nu Finish. I wanted easy and not to have to work too hard. There have been so many positive reviews. Maybe I did something wrong, I'm not really sure.
B003D5E85W|5|Great product!
B002PUR77W|5|The Dolphins mat works well...and looks great!
B000CIQ5EA|4|I installed this pump about a year ago in my '84 F250 with the 351W. So far, no major issues. I also installed the Carter 18-14U isolation kit and can report noise is not a problem. Before I start the engine, the pump makes just enough noise to tell me it is running, but it can't be heard over the sound of the engine:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005GC5ZDO Carter 18-14U Fuel Pump Mounting Kit]]<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind is this pump is not stocked at most auto parts stores, unlike the original mechanical pump on my pickup. Because I use my truck to haul a camper long distances from home, I carry another pump as a spare. Better safe than Catholic, I've always said. I've had no hiccups in over a year so carrying a spare is probably overkill, but I didn't want to be stranded waiting for a replacement pump to arrive.<br /><br />About the only issue I've had is the output seems to vary. The specs say the output is 6-8 psi. Per the gauge I've installed, the fuel pressure at the carb inlet can range from 4-10 psi instead. I do not know if this is a problem with the pump itself or the indication, but the engine does run fine no matter what the gauge shows.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00062YT68 Holley 26-503 0-15 PSI Electric Fuel Pressure Gauge]]<br /><br />Make sure you use some sort of automatic shutoff for the fuel pump. Instructions are included with the pump.
B000CO96VI|5|NICE TOOL
B000BH5MAA|5|The jack is great but the ratchet that comes with it feels as it won't last long
B007EDAHNQ|3|The sunshade works well but I don't think it's jumbo as it was advertised.<br />I have small Mazda 3 and it just barely can stretch across the windshield. Also the suction cups are good for helping it stay in place, but I don't like the suction marks left on the windshield. I just don't use them. The teal color is very nice.
B003L358WI|5|Works
B00P9R8PPG|3|Wonder how long these will last. I put them in our convertible, which has the top down as often as possible, so the seat covers are in  the sun most of the time. I have a feeling the black is going to fade quickly, but of more concern, I wish the fish line lacing the beads together were thicker or at least a couple of strands.<br />Since the seat belt shoulder strap is built into the top of the seat back, I can't use the elastic band to hold the covers in place. However, that may be an advantage, since the cover swivels a bit when getting in and out of the car, which is pretty handy.
B0043AV4NK|5|Sounds wicked good totally worth it
B00EDMWZZ4|5|I'm a field technician and I use this daily and it hasn't broken yet and functions as it is supposed to, so not much to complain about.
B00OLVGGZM|5|The mat is perfect to protect the floor on my 2105 F150 Super Crew, it is well made and is a perfect fit.  It is a low cost alternative to spray in or drop in liners.  I highly recommend this product.
B0002KR88A|1|Updated review, and it's bad.  I had an initial review of good on this item regarding it's construction until I tried to solder the leads to some copper wire. The material used in these fuse leads is some sort of extremely inferior copper or &#34;copper-like&#34; metal and is impossible to solder under any circumstances. I found out the hard way and after the fact. The only chance you will have to incorporate this fuse to a device is by wire nuts or by solderless crimp connectors. And the way the so called stranded wire resisted being soldered and turned black and charred gets me to thinking that there could be some serious resistance going on and a resultant undesirable voltage drop or intermittent issues. I don't think I'm going to trust it to my vintage 2-way transceiver and I would highly recommend anyone NOT to buy nor utilize this product. It's only $2.64 with shipping for a reason. Don't do it.
B005EA2KA4|5|They fit perfectly, easy to install
B003VAX3IC|5|Best invention since sliced bread. I've bought them for all of my company trailers.
B000CGR4BU|5|Great
B00ELN89P0|5|Love the magnets!! So clean, and says what it has to say.
B00I82CIAM|5|These replaced the original corroded nuts perfectly.  They look as though they will last longer too.
B001G7SU6M|5|So easy to install. Perfect match for 2002 4Runner
B006LLB2UE|5|Fits perfectly for my car to check my engine oil!!
B00P2D41OQ|5|Good quality, nice white light
B00LL6PK2K|5|Thoughts on this particular tire gauge after a couple of months of ownership.<br />1. It appears to be accurate as I checked it against two other mechanical gauges.<br />2. Although it is very light which initially made me think it was low quality the case seems to be holding up. It is a two part plastic mold held together with two small eyeglass type screws. The activation button continues to have a positive click<br />3. The blue LED is easy to read and does come in handy during low light situations.<br />Disclosure: This item was sent to me  complimentary for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are honest and my own.
B00891X1M6|1|It didn't state that it was only good for certain models ! So order was returned.... Great people at Patricks Suburu
B000WG951W|1|Ordered in April broken by August. Barely used!
B00FL8JU70|5|Just as expected. Thanks.
B00CC2ZU4K|5|I love the lights I got 5000k, low beams but everybody seems to think I am bright lighting them when I ain't here is a picture of the lights vs stock an this is on a 2014 toyota camry se
B0088BX0IM|5|Easy to install looks good on my Harley.
B0037WIRDA|1|Poor packaging...missing parts washer But
B007LIB6AW|5|AMAZING
B000OQCHLU|3|It's an oil filter. What's to like about it? Or not?
B00S72R2UY|5|Worked as avertised
B009S954J6|5|yes they fit really snug and don't rattle like my old ones
B001TAPLYA|5|Easy to install and looks GREAT!!!
B005HEJ11S|5|Great bag for the older bikes with a less rounded or maybe flatter tank top. To bad they discontinued this model.
B001HATY36|5|Good price and extremely hard for a thief to contend with.
B004BS0M50|5|Great
B00T62RK1U|5|Like led light
B00E8SQMHA|5|For the butterfly lover.......I love it! Easy to install, looks &#34;classy&#34; and does provide a comfortable grip as advertised!
B00T9U3IIS|2|Using the size chart it still was a little big.
B004R33MLA|4|This is a good product and you can find video's online that do a great job of showing you a step by step install. I would have liked it if they would have packed a few extra connectors because they are easily damaged while trying to attach them to the wires. All in all it was an easy job, took maybe two and a half hours but I was alone and taking my time. Definitely worth getting.
B001NZRABS|4|Slightly more beefy than stock. Took grease without issue and installed smoothly. Come with a set/stop nut, a castle nut and cotter pin.
B00THR39SC|5|Look good!
B001J4XB7A|5|Great replacement part for my 02 ford mustang v6. It fit like the original
B000S2SSYK|5|Perfect fit.
B000B8N3IM|5|Seems to be a good replacement for a very old radiator cap. Used it on a long, hot trip and all was well.
B000C9I8GW|5|very good
B00BT0KJVK|5|Works great in our rv.
B00466V9AY|5|works great easy to install only thing battery died after a week we all know they don't last forever  but other then that will buy again
B00KZCMZP6|5|Nice
B000C2WFOU|5|Worked for our application and was as described.
B00LCASTZA|2|Questionable if the electric connection for gas gauge is working
B00IV50JTS|5|This thing is awesome!!! I live in Florida and I was surprised at how cool this kept me. I have leather seats and I dreaded having to go anywhere because I would sweat so bad. I'm so happy that this was affordable and did exactly what it claims to do
B007VRCTD6|2|Did not fit go kart and they wanted me to pay to ship it back, I ended up giving it away so beware of measurements.
B005T7RPS4|5|Great oil filter. Car runs a lot smoother now.
B00A1BMNFI|5|Fit perfect! Highly Recommend!
B007P9YXWA|3|Used thes for a trip from North Florida to Denver and back and they worked. Having said that, they were about to fall apart by the time 4,000 miles was done. Do yourself a favor and get waterproof boots, that's what I did.
B0031H02I4|4|This part was installed in way less time than removing the old one. The oil leak problem has been taken care of.
B000C451LW|1|First I'd like to say the item came quickly. That's the good part.<br />Now for the bad:<br />I should have known when the bolts were difficult to go through. Bad workmanship. The holes in front were not aligned 100% with the holes in the back and therefore I was unable to secure the unit as it should be. Also had a hard time trying to fit the unit in between the left and right within the bracket.<br />Worked over 2 hours thinking that I was not doing a proper job when after all it was due to the poor fit of the item. The bolt just could not go all the way through in order to be bolted onto the bracket. I'm returning this and purchasing at a local part store for only $11.00 more and I believe that it includes the reservoir as well which would make it cheaper then. Will update at a later date as needed.
B000I5D2Q6|5|Very  good shipping time and good product
B009G3SGGW|5|Have only had on for less than 500 miles but seems to be working just fine.  Ordered for replacement due to abs sensors were rusted in the old ones
B001C6IVZC|4|This part was installed a while ago and is functioning as it should. The engine/transmission no longer 'buck' when shifting into gear.
B00L28Z85G|4|Used it a few times and works fine. Showed oxygen sensor fault. I replaced them, cleared code, saved about $100.
B0084UJRPW|5|perfect fit and was shipped fast to my door. this is must have for any SUV,CAR OR TRUCK!
B00I7ELHL2|5|Shipping was fast...fit great...price great
B001CIEIYI|4|Perfect fit for my 2005 f250 it's loud but I like it means hp.
B00EJF15H4|5|Got this 3 days before it was scheduled to be here put it on immediately and love the look of it. I would recommend this for others
B00CHEXGBC|5|Feels pretty good and solid. The material is made in high quality. Just wish the price was lower.
B002N5W8Q4|4|This little fan does an amazing job of helping keep the trailer refrigerator uniformly cool.
B004940ZSK|5|Exact OEM replacement. Great price. Got same-day delivery AOK. Some good online how-to pics available. No steering wheel/airbag removal necessary. Works great.
B00P2D3W0A|5|Excellent red color output with way better brightness than OEM lamps.  Design is elegant and very well solid made with ceramic base material.  Feel smooth and luxury in your hand.  When holding and looking into the LED bulb, it makes you think that you are using one of the science fiction product.  I like it very much but I have to connect the PHILIPS load resistor in order of making the LED to work without any error show on dashboard.  Unfortunately, my rear lamp fixture and car metal body has no much space left in between.  The rear lamp cover fixture is all plastic which not recommends to mount the load resistor due to the heat releasing from the resistor.  Read the warning caution from load resistor, saying it needs at least one inch space gap of installation.  I think the load resistor could be warm to hot while using the LED.  I can't find any good roomy space to mount the load resistor in the rear of my car.  The safety issue is holding me off.  I just disappointed why PHILIPS not to encounter this problem by build-in the load resistor with the LED would be great help for us.  Otherwise, I still do like this LED product very much but I am chuckling to return it and go back to the old school way.
B000BQUEWC|5|Great product. Alot of room to put stuff in including a pen/pencil holder. I love it!!!
B000GVANDC|5|This was the best choice that I could have made.  I LOVE MY NEW PIPES!!
B001PWFPE8|5|Easy installation,  works well.  I installed it to protect the kid's fingers.  The truck tailgate is a little heavy for them.  It drops slowly, smoothly, and safely with a shush sound.
B0057XWNH8|1|I was expecting a cloth flag and it was foam with a sticker.I guess I didn't read the description . My fault.
B00HUM9UC0|5|perfect fit as advertised, could not be more pleased
B001TI5IIQ|5|Just bought a low mileage 2004 Civic that sat outside for its whole life.  Was going to look up replacement headlight lenses to replace the foggy yellowed ones. Found this product instead.  For less than ten bucks and 45 minutes of elbow grease they look brand new!  Very happy with these results!
B003PIPBQC|5|This installed easily on my 2009 Toyota Corolla and works just fine. I have used a hitch size up-converter so that I can attach a rear cargo carrier that is heavy and have no issues. I think this is a good buy.
B00K326F5E|2|Not a riveting tool as mentioned in the description
B001GBGA0G|1|Vehicle side pins were not located correctly- It mates to the plug without problems but no left turn, right turn, stop light or trailer brakes. When I took it apart to find out why, there where several locations in the plug that had a pin on the vehicle side with no mate on the harness side- you can't even cut and splice to switch wires. This thing is going back
B00KQV19QC|5|Super fast delivery and works perfectly so far. I've had it on for over 2 weeks.
B00PRC8JBS|1|If you have an old cummins this is nice. If you have anything new with technology do not.
B000E28C7M|5|Great oil filter and I like that it is easy to install and remove
B006MX8196|5|Looks great in my KIA Soul, feels great, installed it myself. Kinda wished I had gotten the 2 toned one now...overall complete satisfaction.
B0027I88VQ|5|Quality product.  Mounted well.  Performs well as a lift pump in our Marine application.<br />Make sure to hook up electrical properly.  Will not function if your polarity is reversed, diode will prevent backward hookup.
B00LPYP0BO|5|Nice and easy!!!!!
B00BPWYZYO|2|I bought these gloves in a small...they're supposed to be unisex, but, they are huge on my hands (and I have pretty large hands for a women).<br />I have to keep them because I waited too long to send them back. I'll try to find a way to shrink them or cut them down.
B00UNTU3VO|5|I love this Duster, it does a great job on my car and with the extended handle I have no problem dusting my full size pickup.
B001LWN5SK|3|Everything about this is perfect! Fits perfect on my 4 door wrangler all the way down past the bottom of the body.<br />UPDATE!!! This thing started falling apart at the seams. And the lining started fluffing off....
B00TT7RWYC|5|Perfect. I installed with Gorilla Glue and installed into the Fuse Box. I've got a 2012 Civic Coupe and it couldn't have been easier. This kit is the best bang for your buck. Both remotes it comes with are also really sick
B00NY0S2OY|3|The cover fits ok. It doesn't do a great job of keeping my bike dry. You get what you pay for I guess. Next year maybe I can afford to buy a better one.
B000BQSIWK|3|Works as expected
B00JLZRNDC|5|Nice product.
B000F3RYGA|4|Not ice friendly. But good deal
B00XBJDBCG|5|worked like a charm pulling flywheel
B00NAUKUNE|4|As advertised
B006QH6XQG|5|Real deal
B008G3YQT4|4|I just needed the driver side mat. It was not exactly like the factory mat I got with the 2008 Tacoma. The mat was about 2&#34; short up towards the engine. It works, but not like the original
B00407TTSI|2|This honestly did not match the color of my car. Close, but truly no cigar. Disappointed.
B00DJF3E6A|5|This stuff is indistinguishable from paint in most places and is very forgiving to install. It's 8/22/2015, if you don't see an updated review later it means that it held up well too.
B000GZPH1G|5|No carpal tunnel syndrome here. Helps a bunch in a non cruise control environment. Takes a little getting use to, but can be spun out of the way in a second when you don't want it there. Inexpensive fix for a sore wrist.
B006YB2QQU|4|Make sure if its an older truck you wire in a second wire for the starter it takes the start solinoid and is combined into tje starter
B00BDJ7RH6|5|Very sturdy, looks great and was a snap to install
B00EI6CKVE|5|everyone laughs at my sticker on my car LOVE IT
B00IQFDCSI|5|Great price.  I'm about to have them put on my car soon.
B00SJX4R3G|5|Have put these on several ATVs they work great.
B00C1YI2XA|5|PER FIT . USED THEM ALL OVER !!
B00Z89I2OY|5|I just got a new set of Velcro roll bar handles in and while checking them out I realized they can make a fantastic first aid arm / wrist splint.  Good to know if you ever need it.  They are super heavy duty and very high quality.  I would definitely buy these again.
B0050NGB32|4|Like other reviews state you need to drill a small hole in the base to allow water a way to exit. When I first attached it I was worried about the little bit of play. But after using the camper several times with this foot jack in place I have no worries that it works fine.
B003SWNVI0|4|Works very well. Drove over 300 miles at 70 mph never needed retightened. Every once in a while you'd hear a flapping noise. No complaints here.
B00RM327NG|1|Was very excited at first for about a week worked great. Then the screw from the back kept falling off and so would my phone. Great idea but needs better quality or maybe I just got a defective one.
B00XTY2CHI|1|I bought these hoping to use on my truck during snow plowing to be seen better..all functions work but lights are not bright at all very cheap quality but expected for the price paid
B00JBIB5A6|4|I like the look after installing these tail lights, however the Amazon picture is a tad misleading, I assumed they were darker than they actually are. From the side view the led lights are chrome looking but from a straight on view you can't see the chrome look. Also they clip covers that conceal the 3 bolts that attach tail lights to the car didn't fit as well as they did with the original 350z tail lights. Overall I am pleased with the fit & look of these tail lights, they are definitely an upgrade from the all red original 350z lights.
B000NZOH7E|5|Love quality on these they are a nice size and I hope as durable as they look and feel. No odor or anything either so I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B00SDL2RVI|5|Easy to use , I hope it lasts.
B00R4XMX7Y|5|Super easy install and works great
B00APM4PV8|5|Works great in a fast delivery
B00JMUKIHO|2|The OEM antenna was stolen at night so I decided to get a new one for my brother. It works, looks nice. The signal isn't as strong as the OEM one. This antenna tends to loose it carbon fiber color as it is black. Later it starts to turn brownish with the carbon fiber look on it.
B00DJ3N3SQ|5|Oem water pump began to leak from center bearing. Symptom: Coolant was seeping from bearing, landing on pulley, and flung onto the side of the air box.  Water pump fits flush to m54 engine block, and is performing as expected... No major difference between FMI water pump and OEM water pump other than metal propeller. FMI water pump was a quick fix for the price. I overhauled the cooling system five years ago using a Chinese aftermarket radiator, and I have yet to have a radiator problem. So I figured a aftermarket Chinese water pump will hold up just a well as the radiator.
B001Y91LHW|5|beautiful set of hubcaps for a cut rate price
B00EF9G5S8|5|It fit perfectly & a great price
B009QT1KLO|5|Quick shipping and it does the job!  Always need to have it on hand.
B004VCZ5LC|3|This is more about the seller than the product. I got the full cover that is designed to cover tour packs, the picture of the item I thought I ordered was designed to cover the front of the bike with a windshield and only go as far back as to cover the seat. As a result the cover I got is very loose and floppy. THE SELLER WAS MOTORCYCLE SUPERSTORE.<br /><br />As for the cover, it looks decent and I am sure it will be fine.
B0024NSM92|3|They fit and worked'<br />How can you rate a light bulb
B00BTLEJAQ|4|back seats are a bit tough putting in, I gave up.
B0097EJRSQ|5|Great product. Would buy again
B00XQ6P7JO|1|There not the color it said, their more like an off yellow like stock lights. My headlights are 5k and that's white, which is what I am looking for 😕
B0066TLWGU|5|great item
B0096T8NDW|5|worked as advertised, easy to install
B005F9K1RI|5|Popped it in, worked like it was supposed to. I'm happy with it.
B007HRN2LS|5|This has been everything we hoped and more. We put this in our fifth wheel so we could cool when we are not on shore power. In addition to doing a decent job of cooling on batteries, it is a great air filter. We had a lot of smoke form area fires, and pulling air through the Turbo Kool took away any hint of smoke smell.<br /><br />This is not like a regular AC. It will keep you 10 to 15 degrees below the outside temperature if the humidity is not too high. It will bring the temperature down faster than a regular AC because it's pushing the hot air out as it runs. Because it move air in and out the increase in humidity is very small.<br /><br />Note: I bought directly from the company, so I do not show as a certified buyer.
B00QW59L3E|5|Adds a great little touch
B0027EUPFC|5|Worked pretty good so far
B000BYB478|5|Perfect replacement on my Ford Focus LX 2001
B00BTLEIIY|4|Worked really well on the bucket seats and the back seats of my Subaru Forester. The bench cover wouldn't work because I have a flip-out cup holder that lights up built in to the middle seat of the bench. But I'm ok with that, the backseat is for car seats anyway and I use the car seat protectors made for car seats anyway. All-in-all very happy with them so far!
B005LVU02Q|3|Ended up returning this windshield not for quality issues but as the shield is more for aesthetics than functional (wind protection).<br />At 70+ mph barely covers the area  below chest ( I am approx 5' 9&#34;)
B00K2G5KOS|5|I love it as a sunshade for my car.
B00ODM4I90|5|The chocks are very solid, quite heavier than expected... perfect for out 10-ton rigs!!
B004G08K9I|1|The product came as if it's used. Grease was all over. And then someone put tape on it to cover it up.
B00KMH33R8|5|Yes it did meet my expectations,and thanks for speedy delivery
B00ARUSW3U|5|it arrived and my wife is super excited it fits in beautiful! thanks!!
B000CC0HZ4|2|Broke during first use!!
B000SL4AA2|4|It is quite loud, but works well and quickly.
B00NL1T75O|5|I installed this stereo in my 09 Mazda3. I say &#34;stereo&#34; but it really is so much more. Its more like an entertainment center for my car because it has changed the whole feel of travel. Simply put, I love this! Great GPS included with accurate maps and still can use video outputs so DVDs play to rear monitors for kiddos in the back seat. All the apps I've tried work flawlessly and switching between them is very fast. Not much else I can say other than if you are debating on this unit, take my word for it, you will be very pleased with the build quality and ease of install. I should also mention the audio playback is well above stock stereo sound and everything is crisp and clear. On a side note, I contacted the seller to ask a question about SD card playback and was pleased to get a response almost immediately. It seems that customer service is top notch as well :)
B00AOA2X9W|5|Fits perfect on my 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT crew cab.  My husband LOVES it !!!!!
B008L0DPK8|5|Purchased this for my 14 ninja 650. Sounds way better then stock pipe, and looks better too. A little expensive but you get what you pay for. Just try to refrain from reving full throttle as it will shoot some flames (especially not at gas station). May benefit me to buy the two brothers tuner to adjust fuel ratio. P.s. yes these are loud!
B00VCWSJHG|5|Looks great on my Yamaha Zuma. Happy customer.
B0002NILS8|1|not strong/sturdy; starts to rip after first week--not satisfied
B005FL026Q|4|I used these on my silverado as an upgrade along with calipers and brackets from a newer tahoe, they look good and I like that they are coated and should resist rust.  Good buy for the money so far.
B003SRWPNC|5|The back seats are the hardest part of this item because it takes some dis assembling but other than that once you get them to actually fit snug they are pretty nice once again at the price they are really good I'm very pleased with this purchase.
B007WZRBA8|1|Unfortunately, these headphones were defective immediately.  There is a metal attachment piece from the headband to the actual ear piece that came loose in both sets.  We had to duct tape both headsets the second time we used them in the car.  We'll be sending these back.
B008YFIALY|5|Lost all our local sources. We were so happy to find it on Amazon.  I've sworn by this product for years for auto and home use. I know of nothing better.
B00M1OUBES|5|It appears that this device could be handy as a pocket on a shirt.  Haven't needed it's boost capability yet so only time will tell about that but there is some peace of mind having it available.
B0026MARTE|2|Thanks a lot got the part am happy reached on time. However the light went to Trinidad to a person with my name.
B009DJY7DK|5|All good
B001HBN1K2|5|Look well built and install easily in 262 V6 with no modifications needed.
B00INU56TY|4|This light are amazing
B001AGNCKS|5|Exactly as stated.
B002NIKTAI|5|perfect fit for my '12. will never use a el cheap-o sun shade again.
B008BKFT7U|3|I have an 2012 Prius which this was not rated to fit, but couldn't find another so tried this one.  It works, sort of, but not a perfect fit.  My bad.
B009SSV26Q|5|good buy
B00XKXN6GE|1|Remarkably poor quality with multiple finish flaws and defects--unsuitable for placement on a Tesla unless refinished by a body shop or wrapped at significant cost.  So I had our wrapped rather than trying to return (which the seller makes nearly impossible).  After only a few weeks it won't remain flat/attached at the ends due to warping.  Overall, a very poor quality product and the difficulty with returns make this a &#34;NO BUY&#34; item for most:  AVOID.
B00OXWZ60A|5|works as designed. check engine lite is off.
B00KH4IFAQ|5|Perfect. Everything a proud North Korean would ever need
B003CGH13S|4|Windows feel a bit thin, and stretching it over the top of the jeep was difficult the first time.  Great product otherwise
B004DRT4ZS|5|They look good on our pathfinder, she can see much better now.
B00I4CLY6A|5|Worked good
B007H2PYVE|4|Very good quality for the price
B00D1CQV4I|5|I installed them behind the grill of my Silverado. Very bright
B009S2ZPTC|5|This was probably the best idea I had to buy these. I broke the handle on the driver side of my 93 F-150 twice before I decided to buy metal ones. My door opens so easily, I should've got these earlier. I used to have to yank on the handle hard in order to get my door to open not anymore. Extremely fast shipping. Clearly marked for which side of the truck they go on. Easy install just need a phillips head to remove the panel and a 8mm to install the handle.
B00XQ6NIE0|5|Saw these bulbs way more expensive on other sites. Shipped quickly. My headlights now work great!
B00G2TV7OG|5|Super bright & work really well!
B00HS5WJ2C|5|Really good price
B00HE68O10|3|It's better than the black spot of missing paint that was there before. It will do until I have it painted professionally. Not bad though....decent cover up.
B00EUIDYJW|3|Looks very good and is constructed well, but there is nothing to hold the plate in place except the screws.  This would be fine if your plate mounts with 4 screws, but mine mounts with 2, so I had to bend the thing to get it to sit flush with my plate.
B00UXXJHTO|4|the battery moved around a bit at first, but now no problems at all.  Thanks!
B00802F2US|5|Nice
B00FZGNEYI|5|These worked great.
B00B1H8HLA|4|Not quite as easy to install as I thought. One flaw in light bit otherwise it is great.
B0013HJDOI|4|Great brush but be sure to pull out the loose hairs before you detail or you will go crazy seeing hairs all over your clean car.
B000GZGPWG|5|Duplicate of my front review... When I changed all 4 they fit my Sierra 2500 perfectly and totally changed the dynamics of the truck. Slightly bumpier on a flat road but significantly more control and less harshness over bumps and at speed. Have yet to test off-road or with a heavy load. Build quality looks good and the price is right. Hope they last.
B002009AOK|5|Fits my 2014 Pathfinder perfectly
B00GHSBN0K|3|Did not fit my 03 Chevy Avalanche 2500 instrument panel as expected. Exposed a white line across the top of the instrument panel, as well as the top right fastener would not clip in.
B00KSHX7RS|5|Im very happy with this item it's working very good i recommend it for all friends and family Thank you Attn.miguel
B004ZF2YAA|5|Great
B000BUU5Y0|5|Awesome...worked perfectly
B003TPW5YM|4|Ive been using other brands of detergent to wash my car. I was talking to a coworker and he mentioned Chemical Guys. One day I noticed they had it on amazon and decided to give it a shot. Man this soap works wonders. It just take a little pour in my 5 gallon bucket to create suds galore. Ive been using this for a half a year (wash car once or twice a month) and still have half a bottle left. It sure does smell good, like tropical punch, so dont drink it. The only problem I have this this detergent is the lid. Not too long ago the lid broke, so now I have to be very careful when I need some soap. Other then that, I'll be buying another bottle when that time comes.
B00OPMIR2M|5|The light feature makes this the best tire pressure I've owned!
B000HBNX38|5|Highly recommended.
B0024ECHII|5|Great simple product that reduces camper shake
B004GFTC0E|5|my headlights look brand new
B008JORKP2|5|Wow, exceeded my expectations! Flame is plenty big for 2-3 people on low, 15 lb tank lasted about 9 hours.  Well made, 10 ft hose. Cons: none Would recommend to my friends, great product
B002PQJ8VY|5|Great look and perfect fit. Great price too.
B00BCRMC1U|5|Fit nicely
B00COYNZJ8|5|Durable and works great!  Chewbacca is my copilot
B000C5G3W2|5|Excellent fit on my 98' Toyota Rav4! Arrived quickly as well.
B00JIJ4LWW|4|Worked as described!
B00NJ3KYGU|5|Surprisingly bright fog lamps. Id buy them again.
B001DTNC4S|4|Connector fit well.  It did need a better way to attach it to the frame of the vehicle.
B00GJ1HUB6|5|Works good!
B0030VF61E|1|I wanted whether strips for 1995 nissan!
B00WH1ZC80|5|Reliable! A++
B008G35YJA|5|Perfect fit, look like new, and awesome price.
B001BELZ7Q|5|Very good product!!!
B00DGV1WN4|5|Love this plate!
B00JXYEMUS|5|working extremely well so far.<br /><br />My only complaint is that i would like a list of DIY friendly shops that support your product
B002SRZQV6|4|works great very nice product
B000630AQA|1|Simply does not work as advertised.  Front of packaging says &#34;No scrub Wheel Clearner.&#34;  My wife is giving them the benefit of the doubt and thinks wipe is different than scrubbing.  Ha!  Instructions say to spray, let set for 2 minutes, hose off, then wipe off any excess.  Well, when I hosed it off and realized absolutely nothing came off, I definitely had to wipe off the excess - - and there was a lot of excess.  It may work slightly better than just scrubbing with soap and a sponge, but I don't think so.  Read the reviews here and buy something else. By the way, this is a product sold by Illinois Tool Works.
B005FKXJEY|5|Nice kit, came with everything to install on the car.
B0066QSEUU|5|You'll need a press and the right size round tubes to press this in and out.
B003IOKPLO|5|Shipped promptly. Works great.
B008CE0W5Y|5|Great Deal!
B003E3QK5E|5|These Hub Caps Looked Fantastic on My Husband's New Truck!! He couldn't be Happier with this Purchase.
B000JZ5A88|1|It was supposed to tell us that it is made in China<br />So we look for US products because we have this product exists in Saudi Arabia
B00684TAYY|5|Super fast delivery and works great.
B000VKOD9S|4|fit great!
B008BYPFI4|5|Great product
B003IZP0FO|4|Exactly what I expected, has slight brown tint when looking through it. Completely fine for day riding in sunny and shaded areas. Does Fog, but not terrible.
B008BC8G7S|5|Easy to install
B0032W3KH8|5|Good filter
B007DBM40S|3|I didn't receive the correct sticker. The one I received does not have the little Totoro in his hand..just..has his arm held out. That's ok though..I am getting a NRA sticker to put on the tip of his fingers. :0)
B00AFEAH2M|3|It is &#34;short&#34; especially for a 2X.
B001AIZ5HY|5|LOVE IT!!! LOVE!!! LOVE!!! Lenses like new!! Overall car looks sooooo much better without yellow cloudy highlights and now I can see at night!!!!!!
B0060GJLP8|5|Great dressing for the plate instead of advertising for the dealership.
B00NLV9BGE|5|works fine, no problems, quick shipping! A+
B001KQAAFS|4|Seemed a little weak at first for my old worn 2000 Excursion rear latch, but still works it.
B0012WKCR6|4|Overall great value. Fit and finish are excellent. The included stabilizer works well but slight side to side movement is still present. I would recommend  this product to anyone looking to add to the appearance of their truck, and it makes bed access easier as well. I have  seen the same product elsewhere for almost $150, so the savings of purchasing on Amazon is a no brainer.
B003TAB6Q0|5|Wife loves it and after having it on for quite a while, it still looks good.
B008UUNTPU|5|Fast shipment works great
B00HVV60HI|5|This works on my two cars.<br />2008 Mazda 3 and<br />2003 Pontiac Grand Am<br />I use it with Scan Master Lite. You can get that at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.wgsoft.scanmaster
B002E5BW0G|5|Arrived fast, installed with no problems.
B00WGPISQK|5|I have a 46RH from a Jeep 1993 Grand Cherokee.<br /><br />I completely rebuild my transmission. This kit was only a small part of the $1500 spent in parts. Note that this kit does not come with steels, but there may be no point in buying a complete set of steels since typically only a few steels will need replacement.<br /><br />The kit comes with more than the number of required clutches for the higher model transmissions. For the 46RH you would have left over:  2 overdrive-direct (rear most) clutches left over, 1 overdrive (front of overdrive), and 1 other clutch. Myself I machined space to make use of 3 of the 4 left-over clutches and thus increase my clutch pack sizes.<br /><br />The kit does not come with bushings or thrust washers. If you need to replace bushings you may need a lathe to bore out old bushings, or special blind-bushing puller tools.<br /><br />The kit comes with torlon seals for the pump bushing (main drive shaft) stator. But there are two types of stator for different years, of slightly different diameter.  For the smaller 1.18 diameter stator the kit gives you the choice of telfon+torlon or torlon+torlon for the two seals. The original factory had teflon+steel. The torlon are butt-join. I went with the torlon+torlon. For the larger diameter you have step-join torlon -- a very nice seal.<br /><br />The kit has filters for the valve body, and the tiny filter in the overdrive regulator (which is very difficult to find).
B003SYCJFY|5|Arrived as stated. Easy to install and works as needed.
B00NJNWLRK|5|Worked great.  Replaced my old gummed up carb with this one and it started right up.  Still running great months later.<br /><br />Make sure you keep track of which line is gas in from tank vs gas back to tank before you disconnect your orig carb!
B004JBQ2JY|5|Exact fit, great price 1/2 of what the dealer wanted
B008B9FE08|1|Complete Junk!!! If used on a dark color vehicle, sun will heat and adhesive will melt, the emblem will fall off.
B00U6QFQAM|5|great solution to not to have to use a wrench.
B000AME50Y|2|I have a brand new car and unfortunately, the window tinting folks left a small scratch on one of doors.  The scratch was not deep, but it is visible as the color of my car is dark BLUE. Followed instructions on the product and scratch has been minimized but NOT removed.
B00VNBDWPK|4|So far so good. Good comparison to HID 6000k
B00B4KR3MI|5|Identical replacement for the strap on my 03 Chevy Avalanche 2500
B000C53XC0|5|Installed on 2000 chevy extreme to increase my tow hitch clearance. This added 4.5&#34; at 120 psi. Max is 150 but this increase was enough without pushing the psi to max. Towing rv 2400 lbs. with leveling/sway hitch which only had 2.5' clearance without the air shocks. Now with trailer attached clearance is over 5.5'. Only problem was accessing upper outboard side bolts due to the increased diameter of the air shocks during the installation process. I was able to complete process with swivel attachment and 1/4&#34; manual ratchet. Kit was complete and installation took about an hour.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Exactly as described
B002PQSBX0|5|Awesome
B00BMTZRWY|3|worked well enough for my needs
B00TUKY0L6|1|Oh my word, this thing stinks. Reminds me of the old imitation Cabbage Patch Kids from the '80s that smelled like kerosene. The smell gets in your clothing,on your hands and in your hair!!! It's been in the car for a week and it isn't getting better.
B004SJTV2W|5|I found this buy accident but seeing  that it was oem product for that price who could pass on .<br />Perfect fix with no issues. Would by it again.
B004GCDQD6|5|Nice fits perfectly, and awesome price. #allsmiles
B00C1QHDQK|5|looks amazing!
B0095FBTQU|5|Good packaging.  Quality product.  Would order again.
B00JNR2MGQ|5|Great product, but one of the most difficult pieces of electronic equipment to understand its operations and use that I have ever owned.
B00YW6IU6Y|4|so far so good. worked like it is suppose to. not just waiting on the long term .<br />this was on a 2004 Buick Rainier
B0006JLWDY|5|almost 3 years now, product still holding up. I rate this a 10 for being able to stand up to the Arizona sun
B010OOW6QW|5|Expensive. But one gets what one pays for. Perfect fit in all locations. Really brightens up interior.
B000CLOBRA|3|The install on a Mazda 6 was tricky (the rears are way easier), the clips are the tricky part. I ordered on a Sunday, did not get it until the following Sunday.  Way to slow Amazon. I figured Weds or Thursday tops. The brakes, excellent, no squeaks, grabs well, cannot complain.
B00CT2Y84Q|5|Fit my 2011 Hyundai Tucson perfectly
B00LYMX48I|1|Completely worthless. I bought some other wrap in both black and silver carbon fiber which worked wonderfully but this stuff is darn near impossible to get wrinkle free.<br /><br />It is very thin and even with a good quality blow dryer, applicator, and loads of patience it will not work properly. Even if you do somehow manage to get the wrinkles out half the time they just come right back by morning.<br /><br />The only pro is you get a lot of it but does it really matter if it is useless? I think not.
B00FKDJ0J4|5|Exactly what I needed
B000P17NXQ|5|Great controller.  By far, the best on the market!
B008BTLB1O|5|Great lasting cranking power...
B00AW020QU|4|The reason I gave this a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating is because the Amazon web site said it would fit my 2008 BMW X SUV. It does not! Not as configured anyway. I had to cut the center away and just use the left and right pieces separately. With the center piece, the mat is completely too short from left to right. However, after I cut the center away, the two individual pieces fit fine. The thickness and quality of the rubber was much better than I expected for this price point.
B00W4QP4GI|3|Has some flickering issue on center dome light on 2012 BMW X5 works for the rest of truck. doesn't have resistors for center dome light
B001QVA2ZA|5|Works good, yeah
B006U9EKEW|5|good filter great price
B005N6X9NQ|5|Good buy.......
B006RHY0D8|5|Good paint. Comes with top coat as well.
B00CB22BL6|5|Excellent quality. Much cheaper than a vibrant performance piece ($45) and in my opinion the same quality.I just wish these 45* couplings were carried locally to get my shop neighbors truck back up and running a few days prior since his truck is a big part of his business needs.
B000T9LZDI|5|Flitz has always been a first class product, no difference here.
B0045WBVUM|5|Was just as I hope and more
B00GUG9EPU|5|Item just as described, GM replacement clockspring and harness. Installation is involved, account plenty of time to install. The harness goes in several directions, involving releasing and re-inserting individual connector pins in several mating connectors. Several harness ends were unused and had to be &#34;taped back&#34;, as is normal for a replacement component that covers many applications.
B0089IFOWE|2|Had to hammer on metal inside of fender so lights would set in then had to rig shims between fender and light in order for it to set flush and square. Look good but was a bitch.
B0084DVSQK|5|Works perfect! Fits my 2113 Camry nice and tight!  Fast delivery! AAA+ seller
B0046GYOTC|3|Not bad. I'm giving this 3 stars because I have a chip on my shoulder about Chinese made products. I suspect the manufacturer charges about the same as if this were made in the USA or Europe, while not passing the savings onto we, the consumer.
B0084QAEKS|3|Got this for about 2 months and a half and it was kind of discolor. I did keep it clean etc.. but other than the fact that it'll be discolor, the item itself is GOOD!
B000C9TUXC|5|very good
B00NO5OMQG|5|This was a great product replace the original part with these, they went in perfectly and I have had no problems with them
B00E5OUOCQ|1|These car sunshades I purchased on Amazon are terrible.  The first one I received had holes in it and I hadn't even taken it out of the package. Amazon did an exchange and I got my new sunshade last week. I haven't even used it for a week and it has already developed a rip near the seam on one side of the shade. Not only that but the small bag is very small and can hardly contain the sunshade. And even the small bag is starting to separate at the seam.  Previous to purchasing this product I owned a similar car sunshade which I bought from a thrift store for $1.00. This sunshade lasted me 5 years until I lost them.  Your sunshades didn't even last a week.  Unbelievable. I've contacted Amazon about a refund and they will be refunding me.  Other points on this product:  -The two halves of the sunshade are not separate.  It is one unit. -If you have a small car, such as a Fiat, MINI, Smart, Fit, etc... these will not fit properly.  Even the smallest size. -The silver side has a flat matte finish and is not reflective whatsoever. -The material is very thin. -Throw away the useless bag it comes with. -These shades pack up quite small which is probably the only good thing about them.  1 Star.
B00M9WUBBA|5|I've just received my order today,  but I am already very happy with this product. I've never used another motorcycle Intercom so I really have no reference for comparison. These units are nicer quality than I was expecting. They have  a  nice, rubberized finish and a quality feel.  I used the mounting brackets instead of the stick on brackets and the seem pretty study.  I may take them off and use some 2 sided tape with them for extra security. Pairing devices and intercom is easy (1 button operation). The LED indicators on the unit are very bright and make it look like a high quality product. The instructions are clearly writen and easy to follow.  Sound quality and volume are really good when on intercom and playing music. For the price,  you really can't go wrong.
B001EOWQAS|5|Love it. Got this installed with the help of my grandson. I fit up perfectly.
B0065LTR98|5|I loved it! This product was worth every penny!
B00NF17OA0|5|perfect replacement... no more nagging girlfriends asking me to replace her old beat up one.
B00TP8FVK2|5|Came out great love them
B00BD4SP4A|3|They don't fit over my headrests or the bottom of my seat very well. Also too many hooks to use for best fit.
B0007LL0CO|2|This was good only for four months. I have problem with the contacts inside the plug
B003UKN7Z2|5|Two weeks after replacing the broken regulator, the new one works great.  Removing the door panel was the hardest part of the job, which took a bit over an hour.  The wiring lead on the new regulator seems a little bit shorter than the original, so there is one wire hold-down from the stock regulator that I didn't use (but it's not a big deal).  When replacing you have to lower the window about 1/3 of the way to access the two bolts that hold it to the regulator.  I'm not a glass or bodywork person, but I duct-taped the window at that position, attaching it to the top of the door frame before detaching the stock regulator.  Doing that, replacing the regulator was just a matter of positioning it inside the door, running the wire, and putting in the bolts.  I used a 10 mm socket and a small extension.  Attached is a side-by-side of the stock regulator and the new one.
B00BGTPNBK|5|Thanks, item as described
B00ZJICOKM|5|very happy with this; had purchased a new bike at distance from home this simplified getting it transported locked in was easier to tie down.this fit my suzuke marurder 800
B008Y7IDO6|5|perfect fit

B000O0E890|5|Looks great and protects the paint on the fender
B000BRJFHQ|5|good
B0009N30GE|1|do not like this. it leaves red fibers all over the place. poorly made and cheap quality.
B00WRZZE7K|1|Advertised as 2&#34; when they are only a 1&#34; spacer have not put them on yet to verify fit but will be doing so tomorrow I would recomend just buying 1&#34; spacers for $30 because you will probably end up with the same thing and save $65
B000A8OW9M|5|spark plug works fine fast shipping  Thanks
B0006SH4IM|1|Most of my reviews are positive, but a few products from Meguiar's are just about as bad as one could imagine and deserve a mention. Hyper-Wash is one of those products. This wash was purchased to use with a foamer and first tried on an almost freshly waxed F-150. My impression was that it had uncleaned the pickup. Before using Hyper-Wash the surface of the paint was ultra-smooth and had an extremely deep shine. Hyper-Wash reversed both of those characteristics making the paint feel rough and the shine less than its pre-wash stellar.<br /><br />I also noticed that after washing, the truck needed washing again more quickly than it ever had in the past as it almost seemed that the surface film left behind attracted dirt. I thought maybe it was me and washed this truck a few more times before writing this review in case there was some static properties that needed to be built up in order to get this wash to work as hyped. Nothing good to report so far.
B00RGZWIW0|5|Good functional product; works well to keep my groceries in place- and not scattered all over the place as had been the case previously. Took less than a minute to set up the bottom panels and Velcro dividers.
B000KL7ZRA|1|This is very hard to put on properly, and not so secure from my opinion.  I did not use it.
B009WAAP40|1|This charger is incompatible with the Garmin n&uuml;vi® 2699LMTHD.
B008VWFTIM|1|This thing is kind of dumb. I had to bend the lip a half inch more at the top just so it will flush out with the corners of the bed and the tail gate. I mean for a company to have a machine that presses these out in high quantity why couldn't the thing be bent right?  Im not looking for perfection  but damn! I even mounted it and checked for clearance between tail gate and roll pan. It rubs when tail gate is opened and note the paint needs to be redone.  I couldn't mount it lower because the body lines won't match up. It's like this thing is bent too big. It definitely needs to hit the drawing board and get revamped! Enjoy!
B00K889FCI|3|It was ok but I couldn't use it because stain was inside the light
B00L40DMHI|1|It wasn't the right part
B009OTW646|4|Interesting smell, but foams up well.
B00G6UZIE6|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B008OWDWQA|4|Perfect fit and I really like the grip. It keeps everything in its place while driving.
B005NLQAHS|5|Connection is clear and concise with my Motorola Droid Turbo. Pulls all the data I needed to track down issues.
B0116E88KM|4|Good
B00XPL88NC|5|Very good product,  well build.<br />I just wish that the angle of the valve would have been more adjustable, especially for motorcycle application.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Dang this stuff is good.  Best wheel cleaner I've ever tried, bar none.
B000C8NUP2|5|Worked well
B00NAUKN1I|4|as advertised
B000CAINEI|4|A little big for my car but works fine
B00HNDE10M|5|This is an awesome sticker that represents my Fraternity well. I am a proud Freemason
B00LNGI9US|2|These pants are way to thin and cheap. One ride in the national forest and they were trashed. Holes/tears in the leg down by your boot. Also boot leg cuff needs a way to tighten up. Disappointed to say the least.
B00523AV54|4|It works
B0030DM8JK|5|Product guide very useful in choosing appropriate size lift gate opener. Product arrived as promised and directions allowed for easy installation. Very happy with our experience.

B000CP8EYW|5|Great for high performance engines
B003O6BFOC|5|Very nice quality and work great on my 84 cr250nice
B00QWYO5A4|1|Does not fit on my 2004 mazda 3 hatchback. The plastic pieces are not threaded so the knob just spins around and doesn't stay on. I would give no stars but it wouldn't let me.
B00CF5Q0OI|2|Great concept..... Only lasted a few months though. They glitch up and beep randomly. One of the key chains already broke. Wish they were more durable
B009AD9KYA|5|Great looking shirt fit right
B00MZKHY2U|5|they fit ,  i like the price and shipping was fast
B00E5UD04E|5|I got mine today and I'm very pleased. Very lightweight, the quick release strap is quick and easy and the padding is plush and comfortable. It goes on and off very easy and quickly. Exactly what I was looking for to use while riding my RZR.
B001C3TFKK|5|The price was right and the quality was better than expected
B00KH7065U|5|******* PERFECT *******
B00C8A2WZG|5|These mats are perfect in every way and should be standard equipment. Totally fits Honda Accord Sport 2015.
B00IO8IRZA|5|I bought this for my 2015 Hyundai Tucson SE. It fits perfectly and works perfectly. Spring loaded so you can take it out easily when you need to haul something large.  I'm happy with it.
B002VVJRKK|5|Great quality and fast shipping
B007ZUGBZG|5|Perfect fit
B00HQZNOQO|5|As advertised. Worked well
B000CLJPSA|3|Pads seem to work good but..<br />Hardware was included but sucked, wasn't stamped correctly to allow for pads to be installed properly.<br />Only one pad or the other would go on at a time because hardware wouldn't seat properly although any and all rust was removed.<br />You could clearly see they were not formed correctly for a proper fit<br />Bought new Napa hardware the next day and all is well
B00F52QO44|5|Fits great!
B0079DGP64|5|Easy install! Fits perfectly! Very Good Price!
B00F685J2U|5|It fit perfectly 2014 Acura MDX super handling awd with E package. No issues. Did it myself and my 10 year old daughter.
B004TRKBOK|1|Does not work! My sister got into a car accident and wrecked her car, luckily she didn't depend on this to save her life. But while the car was already wrecked we decided to try this out on it. The window was already cracked and it was still too much for this tool. It couldn't break an already broken window. Also, the seatbelt cutter didn't work either.
B000NCS7GE|5|Gives you a 'view' into what is going bye the sewer connection. Good indication as to how complete the 'dump was'.
B00KHUQ9NK|1|This cover is not leather, it is apparently a toxic rubber from China. I had a cheap flashlight from China made with some of the same material. Years later, it still stunk. It would not surprise me if some Chinese company was shipping toxic waste around the world embedded in these fake rubber products.<br /><br />After touching the steering wheel, I could not even get the smell off my hands with strong soap. Two more washes with dish washing liquid and my hands still smell. I washed the wheel hoping to take the smell off and it does nothing. Based on experience with similar smelling products, this item will probably smell 5 years from now.<br /><br />Repeat: It is NOT LEATHER. IT SMELLS WORSE THAN A RHINOCEROS's REAR END. A skunk is preferable to this odor. If my dog shat in the car, it probably wouldn't cover up the odor. (exaggerating) But, it is truly a foul odor.<br /><br />I repeat, this thing smells vaguely similar to a new tire, but much much worse. Its foul. The smell penetrates everything near it. When I opened the package in a room with a couple people, the person closest to me gagged and ran out of the room, and everyone asked &#34;What is that smell&#34;? I took it out, but we had to open all the windows to air out the room. I put it in the garage. Next AM, the garage reeked.<br /><br />I will try to get a refund. Others seem to have had a good experience getting returns. I hope so.<br /><br />So cavaet emptor. If you don't have a nose, this steering wheel cover might work for you. Gotta go wash my hands for a fourth time now.
B007I79KIG|1|Worked for a month then failed. Put together with cheap solder and hot glue that melted and resistors fell off board. Cheaply made, didn't fit fzr perfect either required slight molding so.there wasn't huge gaps between body and light.
B0009N0W6U|5|Bought 3, they look so cool & work great!
B0038B1GM4|5|These look great and are extremely bright. It stopped the hyper flash that I had with just led bulbs in the oem tail lights. One thing about these. If you look closely at the photo in the ad, the middle led bulb on the top row of the turn signal section is not a bulb!! It is just a silver nub. I didn't notice this until I had them installed. I thought it was a burned out light until I saw it was in the same location on both housings. After inspecting them I noticed that they weren't lights at all. The light that the turn signal section puts out is very bright and the bulb/not bulb gives it a unique appearance. IMHO. They fit perfectly with absolutely no modifications. I would definitely recommend these taillights. Added bonus, these were the only ones I saw that actually showed that they came with a new interior trunk light for each side.
B001OMM6R8|4|works great my son has one to we look like twins when our hood are open
B000QFVJTU|5|Fit great with no problems. This is a better option than a one size fits all.
B00QLBNSPQ|5|perfect gaps on all the plugs
B000KYXI3M|5|I have many elderly retirees in my neighborhood living on a fixed income. They just couldn't afford the prices that the factory charged for new remotes. So I ordered these for them and they work perfectly. The programming instructions were spot on. They are very pleased!
B00AE4U6T2|2|They kind of work, but I don't recommend them. The clip that attaches to the ring broke within a few weeks, they don't beep from across the house or if under a cushion. They look cheaply made, and seem to work similarly. The vendor is very agressive in trying to 'satisfy' customers, but I'd say overall the product is out of date, cheaply made, and doesn't work that well. The vendor does a nice job, but it's type to hawk a new product.
B0082OYG3I|5|Nice way to attach a gremlin bell
B00GLXHM6K|2|couldn't use
B00F7NEREU|5|Even better than expected !
B009T9ZCU6|5|outstanding price, very well made.
B00W8DBZQU|5|fits perfect in my renegade and makes me feel much safer about the rainy days and the winter.
B006STT3QE|5|arrived in a timely manner....perfect for what i needed
B001CKOA2Q|4|Looks pretty cool. Its kinda big tho!
B00B1U6I54|5|check engine light is off, passed smog test.
B0095TC6I6|4|Work well.  Do vibrate a bit in when driving.  Easy install and removal.  Definitely a nice product.  Comes with a carrying case for storage that really helps protect them.
B001TXDGW6|4|What can I say it holds a lot of gas, not for the rider who rides agressivly it adds weight so I only use it if I need the range, it is well made and well designed to do what it needs to do.
B00KOHHLTW|5|Work very well tune  my bike give  litte more power very easy  to use
B00SVYKAVQ|5|I got a set of these for my 2015 Lariat Supercrew in last week. They are true black, not a dark grey or some other semi-black color. It perfectly matches the color of the black Ford trim and carpet. The large rear liner comes in the box folded in half. I laid that out in the sun on the driveway while I was installing the front liners and it was plenty flexible by the time that I was ready for it, and it easily installed in the rear after sliding the front seats forward. I did not find it necessary to follow the directions to do the minimal trimming around the rear console, as I preferred the way that it raised the front lip just a bit higher than if I had trimmed it. If unlike me you regularly have people in the back seat area instead of cargo or canines, you may or may not want to proceed with the trimming to get it to lay perfectly flat around the console. The trimming is very straightforward and out of the spill capture zones, so there would be no risk of damaging the integrity of the liner if you wished to proceed.  Now when I sell my truck years from now the carpet and original floor mats will look like new.<br />I have dogs that I take to the dog park regularly and was concerned that the rear liner might be too ridged, and that they would slide around during normal driving. I was pleased to find that these soft plastic liners have just enough give to let the dogs grip the flooring while driving normally. They might slip a bit in emergency driving maneuvers, but they are much safer back there than they would be in the bed, and they sit below the, dangerous to them, airbags.<br />After more than an hour at the dog park last night, swimming in the pond and wrestling in the red mud with other dogs, my catahoola and blue heeler and my friends shepherd were loaded in the truck after a brief rinse. I went out this morning and with a small hand broom which I plan on just keeping in the truck, I swept everything out with the assistance of a light breeze blowing through the open back doors. I didn't even need the damp rag that I brought with me to wipe down the mats.<br />My life just got a lot easier! Highly recommended. I wouldn't say &#34;These mats are as good as the others&#34;. The others need to live up to being as good as these!the open back doors. I didn't even need the damp rag that I brought with me to wipe down the mats.<br />My life just got a lot easier!

B00GLLW3AM|5|These lights are very very bright,,i have them mounted on the back of my pickup for backup lights you can see every thing. I did silacone the lens and wire so water cant get in. Only been on a week so time will tell.
B007VFERL0|5|Genuine OEM product. Perfect fit.
B000LOI69C|5|Very nice heavy duty hook. I attached it to my safety chain on one side of my trailer that had a broken hook. It's better than the original. I was careful to buy this one which holds 5000 pounds. I returned the wrong one I'd bought at the hardware store from a clerk who didn't understand what I needed. Amazon.com comments and wider choices were more helpful and I finally got the right thing. It was important to have a clamp that closes so it won't fall off while driving.
B000C9GXUK|1|This part has maybe 50% of the weight and volume as my original equipment condenser in my 1999 K1500 Suburban with rear air.  Maybe it would work for a pickup.  Frustratingly I am returning it at my expense.  Amazon return policy is not what it used to be.
B00XZ9NRK8|5|Bought this to replace a lost key. Dealer wanted $125 for the same product. Works great. It still has to be programmed if you only have one key like I did but I knew that going in and still saved $100!
B003TTL0TE|1|cheap product
B0022UP8XA|5|its expensive but worth every penny. fits my 2002 kawasaki concours perfectly! probably a little too big, almost touches the ground, but that's a good thing
B000CMHS9W|5|Awesome.
B000OAG2DK|5|WOW. Everyone in the family loves this in the RV.
B006RL3KH6|3|Kind of expensive for the quality.... I made it work, but some of the little elastic cords are sticking out and the holes for the buckles weren't a correct fit. Wouldn't buy again, but w/e.
B00WZ9ZFVI|5|Bought this for my 06 gsxr 600 and they look bad a$$!<br />Just make sure the gold pin on the brake lever  ( the little notch)is facing the pump or the brake wont disengage. This happened to me first time i installed them. Also great customer service👍
B008JORKP2|5|works great, heat output is wonderful,really nice on that cool evening
B00JRPDCVS|4|This tool didn't open quite far enough to fit an uncompressed spring inside it. But I managed to compress it some and make it fit.
B000CJYUL4|5|Fantastic product, incredible quality and performs as well or better than original.
B000CGFY44|5|Works as it should, easy install.
B008KJT2SE|5|sticks well and does not make a mess like spray on
B00I4CLY6A|1|The felt doesn't extend to the edges where it curves, so I kept creasing the vinyl until I learned to work around it.
B00261FNB2|2|DID NOT FIT MY VEHICLE BOLT PATTERN.....
B002NOI4FO|5|very good,  took pro installer 2  1/2 hr to install.
B00ABYVT64|5|Love them!!
B000EDOSKG|3|Works as well as, except keeps slipping off of bib. A few tries later. Junk. Used hose clamp to secure to bib, brass threaded part came loose! Guess I will be adding another hose clamp.
B00LFL73D0|5|This bearing fit my Camry as advertised and shipped on time.  Saved my a lot of time.
B000FW4LLW|5|No more fumbling around the glove compartment looking for the registration and insurance card.
B000C6OL2U|5|Not much to say. It's a fuel filter. I've just always preferred Purolator for fuel, oil, and air based on reviews I've read over the years regarding quality and ability of their products to do the best job of filtering. Can't beat the Amazon price.
B000N9I500|3|as advertised and shipped in a timely manner
B000E8V9LM|4|Sure beats driving to the auto supply store when you can get it off Amazon for about the same price. Its a filter, it works, woo hoo. Life doesnt get any better than this!!!!
B007ED5USS|5|Bought one for my BMW 318i available in my favorite color blue :+) doesn't loose its form from the sun like other brands that I have bought in the past, good quality for price!
B007CX6IBI|5|Bought these for my 08 focus, they were cheap and look good, no complaints
B003DPPQBW|5|I have a 2013 king quad 750. I ordered the front bumper as well but as for the rear it fit perfectly and was literally a 5 minute install. Looks great and is solid. I ride in tight woods and I'm always backing up into trees and this things does the trick.
B000CQBND0|5|Good if you don't drive your truck or other vehicle very often. Keeps the battery from running down.
B0089IFQR2|3|They dont look smokey in person
B000MHNDSM|5|Good quality works nice
B0064DVB7S|5|Filter fit right in to our circa 1999 Coleman Mach air conditioning units.  They seemed a little thicker than the originals, but that may have been due to the age of my original filters.  Air conditioners working just fine with the new filters.  Items arrived quickly and packaged well.
B003I3PIQC|5|good
B007H5WUGI|5|Just what i needed, well built
B00BNIOH84|5|Same as seen in the picture when recieved, fits perfectly on the front car window, beautiful color, sturdy and I don't have to wait in line with other cars. What a perfect product.
B00IT89OUC|5|Greaat product
B00DLMMWAA|5|They are perfect
B000GQA8DC|3|Ok for the price
B00OQ1GDGY|5|Works perfect, installed and warmed engine up, the fans now come on when suppose to.
B000EDOSKQ|4|Really came awesome product.
B009KBUR2Q|3|Price too higher.<br />Walmart have for $3.98 and longer handle<br />And you have to pay for the freight when you return .<br />I wouldn't buy and would not recommend to<br />Other shoppers.
B00S0MJ6IC|5|very good.
B000C5SGA4|5|check engine gone so far.
B001V8U12M|5|Talk about making life easy.  Used to sweat a bucket-full cranking those camper scissor jacks by hand.  Grab your portable electric drill and set up your camper while keeping your cool!
B00LSTE2SS|5|So far, so good and the price and shipping was right.
B0118P3548|4|Perfect fit .<br />No more water leaks....make sure you also order a seal kit
B00KA3UZN4|5|Great product! I am clumsy with keys and live in Florida. I am always concerned about ruining the fob and cost of replacement. This is a great piece of mind.
B005WTPDUQ|1|I had been using Bosch Icon wipers on my 2009 Altima for the past 3 years and they needed replacesd. Even though they had worked well and had no issues with them, I decided to give the Trico Force a try. They are easy to install and look nice, but do not work well. The they do not hug the windshield well and shutter/chatter across the glass making a lot of noise. I swaped them out for replacement, and it does the same thing. Running my finger across the rubber blade, I can fell small pumps on it.<br /><br />So I ended up buying the Bosch Icon again and got them installed. Works perfectly. No noise, no chattering, and no bumps on the rubber blade edge. When they need replaced in a few years, I'm going to stick with the Bosch Icon.<br /><br />Upon closer inspection, the Bosch Icon blades have a more pronounced curve to them, which is why they do not chatter. While the Trico Force blades have less of a curve to them.
B000WK162E|4|Great product. The only thing I would have liked it to have would have been Crome clamps instead of painted ones.
B00AX51H90|5|Seems that the car runs smoother, definitely increased my mpg on my next tankful of gas.
B005SB0KEW|5|Fits a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Perfectly. Well built and the adhesive seems to be holding just fine.
B00DR67P9I|5|used it for a work light at my mountain cabin work shop and was very pleased with the resalts
B004O2P3H0|4|I did not use these rails.  My installer went with vehicle specific rails, mainly because the holes were already drilled from a previous owners application so reusing the same holes made it much simpler and faster, it only took him 1 hour to install his rails opposed to the 3-4 hours to install these.  Labor verses product cost, Came out ahead using his rails and taking a hit returning these rails to supply
B00CDVNYF2|2|I really didn't like that it didn't come with instructions.  I googled some, but I am still trying to figure out how to set it up.
B000IYGCWS|4|Decent construction. Works though.
B007KTINWQ|5|I ordered this after seeing recommendations on the Wrangler Forum.  It did take a while for delivery, just over a week, but I save a buck off the price from my local auto parts store by ordering from Amazon along with a few other items.  Now, I have used Meguiars spray wax and Turtle Wax Express wax before and I must say the Turtle Wax Ice is far superior.  The Turtle Wax Ice went on easy and buffed off without any streaks.  It was much easier to use than the two previously mentioned products.  It doesn't look as good as a carnauba wax, but I didn't expect it to.  A Jeep Wrangler is a PIA to wax due to all of the exposed hinges and black vinyl bumpers and Fender Flares.  The Turtle Wax Ice did well on the hinges and left no residue when I oversprayed on the vinyl.  You can get it on your windows or vinyl and it wipes right off.  Overall I am pleased with this purchase.  I don't know how long the wax will last, but my Jeep sure does look nice today thanks to the Turtle Wax Ice.
B004A34HMU|5|Looks to be well made and easy to install.  It was, I installed it my self in less than an hour with a little help from a friend to assist in taking measurements, etc.  Every thing went just like the directions said.  After a little test drive, I went back and made a slight adjustment to the alignment and so far I am very pleased with it.  I'm hoping it will provide a little extra measure of safety and comfort on the road.
B00FMUWXBM|5|nice
B000IYPRTW|5|Arrived in 3 days and I replaced it easily with no problem.
B00T6J9TL2|5|This windshield trim is well made and takes less than 10 minutes to install.
B00WQ343ZM|5|A very nice decal
B005CLP8XG|2|well its cheap but it works like a cheap too. broke on the next day of installing it.
B006FBB7FU|4|Looks nice gives my car a distinct look in the front.
B00BZXJDHW|5|Beautiful jacket! Fits perfectly  and will feel even better once the new leather relaxes some. Beautiful design!
B013IOHAHU|5|Came sooner then expected and it looks nice and the material is amazing !!!
B00BG3GT7I|5|My fan died and i needed another one quick. This fan was a great replacement for the OEM.  Others have noted that it is louder but I did not notice a difference.  Very happy with it.
B007WU10ZU|5|Long life? Who needs it? Volvo owners. These last so much longer than a standard H7, they're worth the extra cost!
B00IABG9YC|5|Fit perfect, looks great and was easy to put on, though you do have to have your own screws to attach it.
B00BUHTVZ2|5|It was an exact replacement for what I needed.
B000C59YKA|5|Worked great
B001NFC1BM|5|I have a late 70's era Mercedes diesel sedan that calls for this type of lubrication for the rear end/differential. I suppose the lube works well, the car drives as it should, my only gripe is that it's unlikely that you'll get all of the fluid out of the bottle due to the built-in extending filler nozzle. Made in Germany.
B000BGOJCS|5|Installed easy and it working great!
B003NR6WAY|5|A little small but awesome. Fits for my family perfect.
B00C42T4QS|5|what I expected
B000IY4LOO|5|good price and quality
B00CH3Q4VM|3|Nice I should have went bigger nuts r very hard to get to to tighten.  Would by dc next time
B00GM4UUZS|2|It ripped the first time we used it. We was making a 14 hour trip but you would expect it to last several trips.
B00MGSC2IW|5|Every thing I need for a filter replacement.  OEM parts.
B00PM32Q02|5|Great, will use again.
B002ZS4QCS|4|Love these hooks. I ordered a couple extra ones as gifts. The only downside, which is minor, is that they don't sit flat against the back of the seat when hanging. You'd have to actually &#34;bend&#34; the metal in order for them to lay flat once you hang them on the head-rest prongs. Otherwise, a great concept, as I'm always looking for a place to hand my purse or the handles of packages or plastic bags from the drugstore, etc. Great gift items.
B0042B4B3U|1|It doesn't work as well as i expected, not to mention the warning that says has chemicals know to cause cancer which was a tad unexpected and quiet off putting.
B00R5BHX4I|3|Right size. Everything is as stated. Kind of cheap looking all plastic.
B00T9SRO4E|5|excelente¡¡¡
B00BX5D9I6|5|Skeptical at first due to price, but once arrived, they liked liked high quality. Takes about 15 secs to full brightness, but once lit up, they are much brighter, and bluer then my old halogen lights.
B00657SFPE|5|Worked good
B004GCRFAQ|5|This front bumper outer bracket worked great. Good quality, bolted right up.
B0049DCJ5I|3|The part was correct, but whoever packaged it put the wrong size gaskets in the box. Luckily, the mechanic was able to get the right sized gaskets the same day.
B0017QMORS|5|Nice look
B000O0HOT6|5|This item was an exact fit.
B00C5J1K3A|5|Loved them they fit and look good
B006P88TJ0|5|High quality patch
B00YM8JC1O|4|It was good
B0016C1Q22|5|It works great in my Chevy Silverado 06
B001IVL7G6|3|one was good the other had wrong plug in
B00HA2K056|1|Piece of crap. when i received it was in pieces ! do not buy
B002K64OSG|5|Outstanding  product!!!!!
B0041WV8YU|5|Great product, excellent quality, perfect price. Cannot fault this product.
B00SS3PMU4|2|Outside heat makes it curl up.
B00AST8TN8|1|I ordered these for my Chrysler 300...these pieces are different sizes and they do not fit...I  am very disappointed  and highly upset!
B00BME2362|5|great looks like it came with car
B0042KJV9U|4|Works great
B00B9IVRCW|1|Delivered on time, but does not work.  Online reviews say to check ground connection inside unit and did so.  All connections were tight and there was power to the unit.  Will go with a different brand to avoid anymore headaches.  Doesn't appear that quality control is priority.
B00HFHE6KG|5|best price anywhere. works great even came with a gasket
B00MOYJ0YW|5|great
B00279NFJK|5|It worked good 2003 nissan Altima
B0016LG0CY|5|arrived on time, new condition as described, working well
B00CJUW3HW|5|Good quality sticker, no issues removing and sticking. Exactly what it should be. Shipped in three days.
B005DSSEOI|1|I thought it was Anti-Theft, but these are just fancy screws. And they are not heavy duty at all.
B00KG58LAU|1|Very disappointed with this product. I ordered 2 seat covers and washed them as soon as they arrived. The maroon bled into the white on the front and back. I have one other that I purchased from somewhere else and this did NOT happen. I buy a LOT on line and this is the first negative review I have written
B005U9JE0I|5|I bought 5 of this FAIRY SUNSHADE from DESIGNCOVERS fullfilled by AMAZON.  These are gifts for MY STAFF. It is like CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST. I knew they will scream from top of their lungs of excitement. Lol. I already purchased, 2 red, (which I gave the other one away ), the blue and the black cat sun shades, the jumbo type. ( I have 2 cats at home) for my. LAND ROVER SPORT HSE. I got tons of compliment from my staff. These are very stylish but very affordable. Personally, I make sure to use 2 sunshades at the same time. One on top of each other to make sure it wont be hot inside my SUV. Also, the look viewing from the outside is AWESOME. I use the black cat sunshade coz it is a bit smaller and either red or blue on the bacground. IT IS LIKE DRESSING YOUR CAR FOR SPECIAL EVENT everyday. BTW, I ordered the pure black sunshade and it is on the way. Why  not spend if you love your car.!!! The price does not even break your budget. THANK YOU GUYS FOR THE VERY GOOD PACKAGING. I am very happy with my purchase.  NOTE: 8/25/15 Purchased all remaining stocks. Not available now. Keeping  them as gifts for MY STAFF. It is an awesone sunshade.
B000UTTOFS|5|Bestest
B0031I66LU|5|Perfect fit.
B00TP2O12M|4|Great product but came with no install instructions
B00CBKBQBE|5|Great price for a turbocharger bypass valve. I broke my OEM device upon re-install because the housing is all plastic (overtightened the screw).  This is an exact replacement for my VW GTI 2006 2.0L model.
B003SOKEXI|5|Great product
B007V2CDX2|5|fits the car perfectly and almost matches the color of the car. A little hard to fold and put in the back seat when I have passengers but very doable.
B00B8SZWAQ|5|Just got it a couple days ago, and I love it so much! my car looks so cute, and it doesn't get as hot in there as it used to.
B00G8WLX78|5|nicely made
B000H77DY2|3|ACDelco is my one and only for GM engines but the shipping took way too long.
B00OBEOT2Q|3|I gave them three stars because I might have been the rare lapse of judgement when they were shipping the product out. I received them with one broken lug nut, which isn't bad out of 20 lug nuts but it would compromise the integrity of the wheel which it would have been applied to. They seemed cheap to me but maybe that is because they were so lightweight.
B004J396DQ|5|perfect fit--easy install.will definitely buy from again.
B001QFD7PS|5|Fit perfectly!!!
B008G2J9ZG|5|Works awesome stock ones snapped off during winter these work just as good as oem
B00SWRDU5A|5|Attach this to my ducting in the basement, holds surprisingly long bits and keeps everything together. The magnet could be a little stronger to hold the bits, but as long as you don't mount it upside down it works well enough. Even upside down is fine for most as long as it's not getting bumped a lot.
B000NU5LP6|5|i needed a new rear end for f150 went to junk yeard found one that had been sitting for years i put it on and it made lots of noise .as soon as i put this stuff in all noises went away after about week
B000GD5FMY|1|insanely cheap quality! broke after the fourth or fifth time. what do you expect for five dollars. these are better then nothing, but just barely.
B00IFUWIGG|5|great muffler love the sound do wish it was quieter but not to loud, I would like a quiet muffler but with my space limitations I didn't have many choices had a choice between this or a glasspack<br />has about the same volume as a magnaflow muffler at idle to about 3000 rpm but get the rpms up and it sounds like a race car with the 5.9l in my jeep grand cherokee
B006AG7ZM4|5|Amazing stuff. I cleaned a very dirty 34 foot class a Motorhome this morning. It worked great, loosened all the dirt and bug dropping. With the drought in California, this will be my wash procedure.
B00JRE38EA|1|These do not hold up in a hot car. I've had 4 of them just fall apart it the map light housing. The LED's literally fell off the fixture. When they were new the light was great. But the durability is horrible.
B000GZQOUY|5|AAAAAAAAA+++++++++
B001OBK10S|4|Remaned calipers with hardware but no pads (FRC= Friction Pad  Ready Caliper) , I'm using pads that came with a drilled and slotted rotor set.
B006B2ZCT0|2|The dye on the back felt lining rubbed off on the dash board of my 2014 Porche Cayenne I do not recomend this product at all.
B00D3934TE|5|Great
B003CJHPHW|5|Love the design on these bandanas had got one 2nd hand years ago. Turns out they last real well also. Not your average bandana. I approve of this product.
B00CQFNYYQ|1|Horrible one came broken poorest quality available
B001RO8AD2|5|Great little sticker! I put it on my laptop and people notice it right away.
B004VRLGU6|3|The seller got these to me very quickly I was very pleased.  The one problem is they do not hold there scent for more then 2 days so I was disappointed with that.
B001FCB0ZG|5|great product
B00XBUK19Q|3|Stickers are ugly only got 2 good ones
B00867A9PA|3|I wish it had the cut away spots for tab placements and to see the stickers better.
B00K9ZZXYY|5|Perfect size for using in out swimming pool. It is an above ground pool and the stool help getting out of the pool without too much effort. Another unique item is that if you are the last one out, the step stool floats and is easily retrievable.
B0092F821I|5|Wrong seat how to return it
B00VAVTI60|5|Fit perfectly
B000BQW5LK|5|Superb !!! refilling the rear differential fluid is a piece of cake with this pump.
B00FLXHBBM|1|Waste of money.........
B000CF6S36|5|Fits perfectly.  Thanks
B00NTQLMS6|1|Worked 3 times before the power supply stopped working. Now I have to buy another one (9 bucks). Works fine when the power supply works. Since I have to re-buy the failed wall-wart, I cannot recommend.
B000C9S4RU|5|Part fit perfectly. White wires are a little long and will need to be cut to fit your vechile. Much better than OEM cheap part.
B007V2CS1O|4|Fits like a glove and keeps temps down a bit. Certainly noticeable difference when I use it and don't use. Only draw back is its size. Even folded up it doesn't store great and normally ends up draped across back seat when not in use.
B002R1CYTA|3|Could not complain about the cost.  It did have some damage.  I was able to make it work anyway.
B001GF5FEY|5|I love this heat shield. Previously I purchased a flimsy heat shield that was a universal item and definitely didn't it my car's windshield. This thing fits like a glove. It covers the whole windshield. Compared to an open windshield this thing cools the car dramatically. I can even tell a big difference between my old flimsy heat shield than this thing. Since this one covers the whole windshield it doesn't let the sun in nearly as much. Not only is it preventing the transfer of heat, it's protecting the interior of my car. I couldn't recommend this more.
B007V5B6Y6|1|very disappointed  when it finally got here it was not complete. the box was for all parts, but no fram work was there so I had to send it back.
B00YZ7TKOG|5|Ordered my usual size, and they were a perfect fit.  Nicely made too.  Today was about 80 and I rode 110 miles with these gloves.  I know I was seen for sure, but hands were moist when I took them off.  Perfect for fall and spring riding though.  Light weight and highly visible, comfortable for sure, and look cool.  Especially like the Triumph embroidered on the finger--appears good quality.  Packaged well and arrived well ahead of when expected.
B002VVIQPW|4|I purchased these brake pads for my 08 G35X, so far so good.
B00YV48684|5|Fast shipping, item was as described and seems to be good quality. The directions to program it were spot on. Only took a total of 5 min. to program. Now I have a key that isn't \\"cloned\\" so it's treated like an original and all for 25 bucks! Local locksmith only charged 2 bucks to cut it!
B00KBQBBBK|4|Have not installed yet. I will probably make better connections with the wiring. They are not fully soldered, but are clamped.
B002Y39NJ0|5|These coils are the same as the OEM ones and work great in my MR2 Spyder.
B00HQPV29U|5|My 2013 Mk6 GTI's turbo would hiss when giving it half throttle.  Power was inconsistent from one pull to the next.  I put the car up on ramps and got under it to take a look at the oem diverter valve.  What I found was a light coating of oil on the diverter solenoid which means it was leaking and most likely not holding boost.  After switching out the oem valve with the GFB DV+ this car pulls much better and is consistent through the entire rev range, and best of all no more hissing as if a tractor trailer was driving by and bleeding its air brakes!  Well worth the investment!  All it took was 20 mins, a 5mm allen wrench, and a set of ramps or a jack.
B000NVW1LM|1|Transmission shifting bad after using it, no problems before only had the engine running a little rough but not much. Put some in the oil but didn't help. and one in the transmission which seems to have started a transmission problem with eerratic shifting at low speeds, I'll update if that changes, but I will not purchase this again.
B0057PX86Q|5|Installed easily on my Sym Symba scooter. Looks nice too.
B0091OE6K6|5|A++
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Have a wonderful beach relaxation with this comfortable and easy to use handy mat.
B003PJOLHG|5|it fits my camry perfectly!
B00759UQKI|5|Fits like a glove baby!!!!
B0000AZ8FX|5|Great for the price . Held up this summer so far . Lasted longer then my higher end mirrors .
B008B5X5GC|5|Fit great.  Price was cheaper than parts store.  To bad my local garage broke the stem putting it on the wheel.
B000C65XGS|4|Fit into an '02 Grand Prix with an 3.1L. Put about 5,000 miles on it and works fine. Even cleared up a slip with the help pf some Lucus slip stop.
B0081S0KGW|5|Perfect just what I was looking for.
B004SFKJIQ|3|Center handle didn't last.  After 3 seasons, &#34;pee&#34; comes out the flusher handle.  Up to now, we have loved it for our little guest cabin.  We may try an upgrade as this failed us.  It is used only 2 weeks a year at night only.  The size is good, tho' it's really low to the ground.  Easy to lock and to separate for dumping.
B004GCS7GC|5|Arrived quickly and was super easy to install, about 5 minutes with no fuss. Highly recommended!
B00KLZ65GM|3|It was alright for the price, not as I expected, thought it was going to be heavier fabric. It will do.
B00480BWCI|2|Used on level (almost) and with two layers, the blocks collapsed.  This was used on a 25 ft. class C motorhome. A big disappointment because I have other Camco that I am happy with. Posted as Kay written by husband David
B00DCULP3G|1|Not plug and play did not function
B00JF53ZEE|4|Would have given it 5 stars but the angle of the one I received keeps it from being level.  The back points upward some.  It almost levels out with a few hundred pounds on it so, not bad.
B00N4EYS2U|5|A great product at a great price.
B005CIGI6K|5|Fits perfect in my 2005 Mustang Convertible.
B0040CYTFQ|5|Perfect size for replacing the OEM clips.  Super fast delivery.  Completely satisfied with purchase.
B0013CRFA2|5|Awesome light.  Good brightness, but not overwhelming.
B002807KWQ|5|Perfect fit.had no promlems fitting the smaller holes in my rims
B004UTCS66|1|This one didn't last, it was very rusty within a month
B00KTHXLIC|5|Worked great with my 2003 Toyota Camry LE.  It appears this model does not use the chip since I didn't need to program it.  I found a local locksmith to cut it for me for $4 and I was all set.
B008FOGE3U|4|Seems a bit cheap as it just sticks on with double sided tape.  You would think that Subaru would have something better standard, not as an extra. Been a month and no issues.
B000BXKZUQ|5|does the job!
B00MES4C5K|5|Nice look!
B0027I4JVE|5|Excellent product. Arrived on time. Great value.
B0012X237C|5|So far so good. They work for my Saturn Vue Base
B006BDGDXI|4|It worked good. The only thing is I can't start my car by the remote
B00HWPYU6Q|1|I purchased this item & within a week the BMW roundel fell off somewhere leaving the silver base plate. Total crap with adhesive completely defective.
B000WKF3W8|5|Works great and easy installation
B001OCXCZS|5|Guess the product is fine. Only issue we're having is finding someone to install for a decent price. The Man is skilled, but not willing to risk diy. For now it's in the garage. Bummer
B00I37UJZI|5|Exactly as shown and went on easily!
B004KED7KW|1|Not a single one of these fit my car (2004 Odyssey), and even if it did, all except the far outside wrenches would be useless if the antenna isn't mounted flush.  Maybe my fault for not thinking it through as the design flaw would be obvious from the picture
B0016KH24U|4|this is a fine product but it is not what I thought it was.. I should have read the description better.. Not the suppliers fault.. Somewhere along my trails I will find someone who can use it.
B000F6DNMQ|1|Returned it.  It kept moving...even on clean floor.
B00476VYDU|5|It was perfect!  I used it with tiles to redo an end table.
B00062YYWC|5|Its ok, thanks !!
B0048EZ6XU|1|Horrible! Absolute garbage! Extremely poor fit for the 95-96 Chevy C/K. The company that designed this should be ashamed. Don't waste your money.
B00W41XI16|5|they fit and work good
B0093RRSXS|5|fits right
B004I18FLI|3|Great product. Works fine. Fits perfectly.  Only problem it that it's not as clear as the factory tail lights. It's has a blue tint to it which is noticeable in sunlight. I was bummed about this at first. I got this product because of the price and I expected it to look much more like the original, but it's ok, It works for the money.
B000WMCJPK|5|Great deal!
B00NGHLY4U|5|Excellent items. Easy to install and works great.
B0009IBJAS|2|Bought this to replace a tender that died after 3 years. This one was bought on 02/5/2014 and was on my corvette. It died on 08/20/2015. It has a one year warranty so I threw it away. I bought the Battery Tender Plus which is better made and it has a ten year warranty. I use three chargers for my car and two Harleys. I had BT jr on my bike and it has a 5 year warranty. It died after 3 yrs and they sent me a new one.
B00094I1SA|5|Too sweet!  Have one at home - a MUST for camping.  Who doesn't use paper plates while camping?  This handy gizmo holds the plates securely even while traveling down the road yet offers one plate at a time without digging around in drawers or cabinets.  If you can handle a portable drill and a screwdriver (and what respectable camper can't?), it's a piece-of-cake, 5 minute install.  Every travel trailer should have one.
B000J47ND4|5|Perfect fit for my Chevy Impala old body. Prompt delivery. Thanks.
B004YD1VIY|5|I use these with my carseat. great investment to have a couple extras on hand.
B002KNO9ZW|4|Pretty good product for the money. Mounts front and rear but no center support, otherwise I would have given it 5-stars.  Looks good. Easy installation overall.
B00RJNMOTG|5|Love it
B00JR3RYBE|4|Ok
B0009IQXFO|3|This is an okay product - washes the car up well. However, I don't know what is truly &#34;unique&#34; and &#34;special&#34; about this product, as the car doesn't seem to take any longer afterwards to get dirty. Will continue to use for the sake of that I imagine using a special car formulated wash is better for the car and paint.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|Perfect. L<br />Old one wore out and needed a new one. Lexus would order but would still have to put up.
B00651CFEW|1|No AM reception
B00GSAUHB8|3|It looks like a great concept, but personally it didn't make a positive change in my life. My car was just as hot as if I didn't put this on the windshield. I was hoping that at least the steering wheel will stay cooler, but it didn't. On top of that, I couldn't figure out how to put that thing back in its case. It didn't work for me personally. Great customer service and fast shipping.
B00LLFJFBI|5|Thank You!
B0082365AQ|2|Works well, but will only rank 2 stars because multiple leaks developed in 1 tire after around 10 uses.  Used with a tandem kayak, used caddy over sand and asphalt surfaces.
B00VAX2JIM|5|Good quality, light weight perfect for everyday ridin'.....
B003AOOD9M|1|Don't fit
B004UR1B7K|5|exactly as described
B006ZDXXFU|5|Perfect fitting a very good product
B00062ZGOM|4|works great need dust cover for it.
B00LG07MZE|5|This is the &#34;big&#34; one. If you have a vehicle with a large windshield, I recommend this product. I tried several others claiming to be specifically designed for large windshields, but this is the first that I purchased that lives up to that description. As for the quality, it seems to be at least as good as the rest.
B00DT5HRE0|5|Love it
B002P8EMGI|5|These are indeed an OEM-style valve stem cover that matched perfectly with my BMW's TPMS stems. The threading seems good and the small gasket should protect the valves from water, sand, salt, etc. Some have complained that these cracked while they were tightening them down, to which I ask, what were you using to tighten these with? A pipe wrench? Hand-tight, people.
B00FM1CKK0|5|My daughter will love this -- she is a glitzy girl!
B00GWGXAC6|4|Work well but needed better how to install
B00KGNOYJE|1|Did not like it at all very disappointed
B0080HJL7S|5|I was so excited to get this litter bag that I opened it and immediately took it out to my car.  I know that in the photos it shows that the person attached it to the back of a seat head rest but I put my on the front passenger side and attached it to my shifting bar.  I travel a LOT for work so I usually keep one of those plastic store bags there so that I have a place for my gum wrappers or for the wrappers from snacks and drink bottles that I use along the way.  This bag is a good size without being overbearing and taking up a lot of room. The inside is almost like one of those vinyl lunchbags so that if you have liquid that spills it will keep it contained. The bag is collapsible as well so that when it's empty it won't stick out in your car.  I'm so glad to have this now and I can retire the cheap plastic store bags that I've been using.<br /><br />I purchased this item at a promotional rate for review purposes.  My reviews are always my own honest and unbiased opinions.
B009IF2LEQ|1|Did not work for 2004 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon.
B0076YE4QO|4|Cool !!
B0081SC024|5|Great product and service! I ordered this windshield on the July 1st and received it before the estimated time of delivery. The seller emailed me and updated me on a shipping time frame within 24 hours of ordering. It fit perfect and was easy to install, but the installation instructions were a little vague. Just be sure to follow the advised cleaning instructions, it does scratch very easily, but i knew that when i ordered it. Overall a great product for the money.
B007K294IA|1|Fit in position but bulb receptacles keyed incorrectly returned today.
B00F7GYVCU|5|Looks great.
B007Y5DD3K|5|This fit my Subaru 2005 Forester like a glove, and it seriously keeps out the heat, worth having to store the bulky item in the back seat. In hot Charleston summers, this shade makes quite the difference.
B00IM1VHXS|5|This was a gift for a friend that helped me save a lamb.  She turned it into a necklace.  It throws sunlight in all directions. Actually quite pretty. Highly recommend this seller. Very fast shipping.
B006K8GKBO|5|just what i needed!!great
B001V80IJI|5|Hasn't broken!
B00U0WTLD0|5|Great set of mini wipers!
B00CSBPKY0|5|Fit perfect. Fast  shipping
B00C5SNVO2|5|Fits perfect, works and looks great, super product.
B005ZZH7U6|5|Followed directions and fitted/works well.
B0068ODC1Q|1|It responded to the programming but only worked for 2 days and then quit.  It would not let me reprogram it a second time.
B002ZTGXCS|5|These floor mats are great. They fit my 2007 Hyundai Elantra perfectly and protect the car floor interior during wet weather. This set covers the front driver and passenger areas. The backseat is additional.
B003CSMP64|5|JUST WHAT I NEEDED. GREAT PRICE.

B0025ZMFJC|5|Put 2.5 level springs on had to trim about .5&#34; off each end to have it sit square. There is plenty of adjustment if i decide to with a bigger lift later on.
B00U9U2SJC|4|its good except that the fitting was a little off, other than that i like how it makes my 3ds stands out from my sibling's 3ds

B00IKMWNBO|5|I was very happy with this power vent, I considered others, but I glad I decided on this one.  Installation was easy, fan is quiet and creates great circulation.
B00BFI5SE4|5|Arrived quickly. Worked on my Yamaha  Waverunner WR500.
B003L35936|5|Best oil filter
B001JT5JVQ|5|Love this stuff. I usually use Meguiars quick detail but saw this on sale at Walmart for only $4.50 and 24oz at that. I had to try it. It blows away Meguiars hands down in gloss, shine, reflection and protection. And it is rightfully named 'slick' because it makes the paint surface so slick... Everything just glides right off the surface. I can even tell when I am applying it how easy my microfiber towels glide over the surface. I have an 05 G35 coupe in diamond graphite and this really brings out the depth and intensifies the metallic elements of the paint. I may go back and buy about 10 of them because it looks like it may be discontinuing soon by the looks of the pricing. I am a long time, meticulous, detail enthusiast, and I used to have my own mobile detailing business. This meets my standards and gets tons of compliments on my 10 year old paint. Definitely recommended...
B004QHL9B2|5|Product as expect! Fast shipping!

B00FG8K70Y|5|A great buy
B005IGTQ56|5|It fit perfectly on 11 foot long yamaha sho.  However description is wrong say it is for 10 foot long waverunner.  I had to take hours looking up model numbers and finally confeonting vendor with mistake.  HE SAID HE WOULD CORRECT IT.  Hope he does for the sake of others.

B00CO6PZLC|5|ok
B00WY17PKG|5|Good quality. Fast shipping thanks
B00PV6UIDW|5|Fast delivery and easy to install.  The only challenge was getting the covers off so I could install the new LEDs. It took me about 15 min to do 8 lights. The look is great.  They are a bit brighter than I thought they would be. I installed the 6 ceiling lights and the 2 door lights.  Im guessing the others are for the vanity mirror but Im not real sure.  I have not installed the lic plate lights but they look a little harder to install.
B00IS91RJ8|1|Didn't stick on well
B007IPSXFO|5|Just what I needed would recommend to everyone.
B006JJ7BXU|2|Lasted only a few months installed in a pool sand filter.  So much for a premium product.

B00KSXWRBE|5|works as promised.
B004A6NB1U|5|People often neglect their cabin air filter. I purchased a 2013 Hyundai Elantra with 25k miles on it and one of the first things I looked at was the cabin and engine air filters. The engine air filter was very clean, but the cabin filter looked like it was original to the car.<br /><br />I had a hard time finding a cabin filter at a reasonable price. I previously had a cabin filter without the carbon and I did notice the difference in the smell. I think this one with carbon does a better job when you are behind a particularly smelly vehicle with a lot of exhaust.<br /><br />Fits my 2013 Hyundai Elantra perfectly and does it job!
B000WK3NBG|5|Great air filter oil.  I Have used Maxima air filter oil for 15 years and still happy with the performance. Never had an issue or reason to try anything else.
B000CSZITS|5|Perfect fit.
B000LC87V6|3|Didn't fit.

B001ILIQXI|5|All the wires fit perfectly on my 2000 CLK 430
B00A82LVUS|3|The battery works great had my 15 million upside down for 20-25mins straight and was still going strong stopped because flashlight was so hot but it does not properly fit the 15 you have to bend the connectors
B0009TS9QE|5|Not much to say. Quality stuff!
B0024NSS96|5|great product, met every expectation
B00388I9BI|4|Gr8
B00NXRXGLC|5|Came at the perfect time, held up excellent for heavy rains!
B00JH74EH2|1|These lights are junk the adhesive on the back is not sticky enough to stick to anything.When you peel off the paper on the back more of the sticky stuff comes off with the paper then what sticks on the back of the light.To install these youll need to put your own adhesive on the back of the lights.These lights are not flexible you cant make a tight turn with them they wont lay flat.These are not what i expected and they dont come in the box shown on the ad they dont come in a box period.No instructions,no box,no switch to power them up,no extra wire.Try to install these and it will make for a long disappointing day.
B001P4KEWE|1|The seller failed to mention it had no adjustable bungee straps and no shoulder straps 3 of the 4 plastics around the locks were missing one of the zippers was completely off !  The bag does look good though !
B006NZTZLQ|5|Works great and really fast great product
B00X4UW90C|5|My husband loves it
B000N8DM0Y|5|yep fits 2002 mini s
B0051TPJKG|5|Just what I needed.
B00SJP09HC|5|Look on youtube for some tips on how to install - there is a high tension spring on the stand that can be a beast to install unless you figure out the trick.  You can either fasten the spring to the rear wheel and roll the bike to put the tension on, or use a ratchet strap to add the tension to get it mounted.<br /><br />Once you get it mounted, this is a nice center stand.  The NC700X goes up on the stand easier than some other bikes I have owned, which I appreciate.
B002M3FZNA|5|Excellent gauge.  It took some checking to finally come up with a dial type gauge.  I really like the bleed valve for fine tuning the air pressure.
B007TY06JA|5|fit good no problems
B00230KKJQ|5|good service, works really well, not as messy as the others I have used.
B003FBV8ZW|4|good deal
B01078GH6A|5|Fits very nicely on the floor in the backseat of my car. The strap is nice so the bag does not move around. Would buy this item again for other vehicles in the family.
B0075OWK4I|1|Stays charged for 10 minutes max
B004BTOH5A|4|this arrived quickly and worked perfectly
B0118PULOA|3|The helmet is not as low profile as I hoped it would be, still has that little bit of a mushroom look. the chin strap is really long, but I like the fact that it has a snap button so that it's not flying all over. The helmet serves my purposes. It was good price.
B001KS6FPK|5|Great fit used to replace the rear wiper on my 2010 Mazdaspeed3 so far no issues and works as expected.
B0084UKJPO|5|It don't get better then weather tech
B00KTHR1RE|5|07 Nissan Titan and it fit perfectly!
B00HVIAJQE|5|Fits my key perfectly and looks great. Bright blue is easy to find in purse. I hope this helps keep key fob together because I've had to replace one that cracked open and it was very costly.
B007F9FQIU|5|We started out with a reese sliding 5th hitch, in a  07 GMC 2500 gasser pulling a Sundance 3200re, which was our first 5th wheel.  We had no Idea what to expect but man was that Reese noisy.  It made all kinds of popping and squeaking noises that we just though were normal.  After a few months we traded the GMC in on a 09 F350 king ranch which came with a B&W Turnover ball type hitch installed.  We were told that the Reese would not fit in the F350 and that B&W made a hitch that would use the Turnover ball system in the Ford.  It seemed expensive at first but we went ahead and bought the Companion.  The best decision we ever made.  It is hands down better than the reese and all the noises stopped instantly.  Fast forward 5 years we are still using the Companion and it is just as good as the day we bought it.  B&Ws customer service and life time warranty is second to none.  We broke a bolt off in the hitch while removing it from the truck about 3 years after we bought the Companion.  One call to B&W and they sent out the replacement part and bolt next day air with no questions asked.  This is an outstanding, American made, product that once you buy you will never regret.  It is now installed in our new 2015 Dodge 3500 pulling a 41 foot, 16K Hartland Bighorn!
B000QQZ9H2|5|better than the OEM, you can grease it as well.
B00FMUYYT6|5|These will NOT fit a 2015 GMC Canyon / Chevy Colorado.  This seller is great and I received the product quickly despite it not being a Prime purchase.  But despite this item looking very similar to the OEM bed mounts for the Canyon/Colorado, they're not the same.  See pic, this product is on the left, the one which fits the Canyon / Colorado is on the right.  The part of the component that fits through the hole in the bed is identical but the face plate which backs up against the inside wall of the truck bed is larger and won't fit the contours of these mid-size pick-ups. I was hopeful and therefore took the chance but I'll have to start the return process.  The rating is for the seller and because he didn't claim they would fit and because he stated that if they didn't the return process would be easy.
B00RM8XUCI|5|Great quality. Comfortable on the feet. Easy to install. Have been riding with them for a few months now.
B00FDW4FMY|1|2.5.16 update.  So I've had an opportunity to use the heater and have to say it provides very little usable heat below 35 degrees.  There are 2 problems.  1. I have doors an enclosed cab and have tried my best to insulate where possible.  When you are traveling above 15mph there is no way the little fan can overcome the cold air blowing in so it really does no good.  If you slow below 15mph you get heat for a couple minutes until the heater core cools because the RPMs are too low to push the coolant into the heater core.  If I stop put it in neutral and rev the engine I can feel it, otherwise it really does nothing.  I spent a lot of time and money installing this to be very disappointed with it.<br /><br />Great heater once you get it installed.  This would be a fairly straight forward install if the included instructions were for the correct unit (EPS vs non EPS)  I purchased the heater for a Rzr with EPS, where the heater is mounted vertically, the instructions and the template was for the non EPS with the heater mounted horizontally consequently non of pictures matched what I was doing and most frustrating was the template to cut the holes for the heater hoses was incorrect (one of the hoses didn't line up and had to be re-drilled)  Lastly they forgot the supplemental  &#34;priming&#34; instructions good thing there were plenty of posts on the various forums referencing the same issue.  When all ways said and done it took a total of 5 hours, I refilled the radiator, let it heat up and in 5 minutes it was blowing very hot air.  Knowing what I know now, it would probably take me a couple hours to install it.
B000GU20K2|4|Perfect fit to my FZR 600. I had used this for 2 months and did have a slight issue. Idk if it was a defective unit or my bike providing to much power, but the wires did melt on the one I bought. The switch itself remained in excellent condition. I de-soldered the wires and soldered new on. I have this 4 stars bc I would buy another even with this issue. I believe it to be the one off instead of the norm.
B0024NO80Y|5|Great headlights for an 03 Malibu.  Came crystal clear and easy to install.
B00UPRVJDK|5|Very easy to install looks good on vehicle good quality, priced good must say sure does make vehicle look nice and for a extremely short woman like me it is soo much easier getting into 🙌 very happy
B00LTX840A|4|Works great for the application I bought it for.
B0096XAL56|1|They mislabeled. They for got the letter N. It come saying &#34; I'm proud to be Colombia&#34;
B007D3YI64|4|I like the bag and it arrived quickly, but it is way smaller than I anticipated. It's barely big enough to fit a carrying side-arm.  The quality looks good for the price. No instructions.
B00860E3JK|5|Works perfect for my turbo set to add a wsstegate
B008VGP456|5|I never expected to find these plugs. They worked great.
B004TZNS3S|1|Cheaply made. Better ones for same price from Masonic store.
B0073MFCCY|5|work great
B009DJS09M|4|Bumper had sharp edge extra flash on ends. Fit was good.
B00GDXIJWE|5|Worked out perfectly for my back window on my car
B0002NYDRG|4|After destroying a set of bits from a kit from HF, I purchased this one and it did the job well.  Used to loosen Metric flatheads on the floorboard of a 16 yr old ATV.  Why not 5 stars? Nothing is ever that good.  Great for the price. No indication this is made in U.S.A.  Another said it was. IDK.
B0009JB7GI|5|This item does exactly what I want it to. My kids can plug  in their devices to use while on the go.
B008PHIB1A|5|I received the shade promptly. It's attractive, does what it's supposed to and folds neatly for storage. Lightweight and helps keep car cooler.
B000C9MYWG|5|Perfect fit...arrived quickly
B002UC8OCW|3|The cover fit perfectly, but the metal was so thin that it bent putting it in.
B003V51WG2|5|Awesome items
B00GG9FB8U|5|Talk about a wow factor. I live in a beach condo. So fighting over a hose is asinine. Not to mention it makes my '15 Kia Optima look like a Ferrari
B0084L0YR6|5|Works great and I have a fan now!  It is working like a champ and not that hard to install.  2003 Silverado with dual zone climate control. LS package.
B000OO2Q86|5|Worked great on my 84 cr250
B00V9XRZYQ|5|Good price and something I need regularly as I tune a lot of lawn equipment
B000HAB81I|2|Don't wast your money on using this for old R22 home AC.  If you have an AC leak on a home R22 system it is most likely in the evaporator and it will only get worse.
B00WOXUH8Q|2|It was not as I expected due to pressure of  the AC, the technician who installed the compressor said that it is not that good inorder to make the car cool.
B00N8BFGIE|1|Terrible quality, falls apart. It's cute but not good quality.
B00KAHL7Y6|5|Can't beat the price at all. Looks great as well. Had my doubt's at first but a few of the guys who brought it helped me to see it would be a good idea to buy. They haven't steered me wrong yet. Had mines painted and installed at my buds dealership. If you buy you won't regret it.
B001CUCPJQ|5|Only one if you want your vanagon running right
B002DMZA2G|5|This was perfect for the automotive A/C job I had to do. Was a bit worried it wouldn't pull a full vacuum due to other reviews saying numbers less than 29 inches. I'm not sure if it's just an elevation thing (I am at 12 feet above sea level so atmospheric pressure here is right about 30 inches), but mine pulled about as close to a full vacuum as you would expect (according to my manifold gauge it was definitely more than 29.5 inches of mercury).
B0048EZTTQ|4|Good quality material looks very nice .But shipping  arrived late
B00KWW67YO|5|bought this one for my husband and he said he it was pefect for his motorcycle. good quality for a fair price
B00GRSOJSS|5|Works well
B006QZ43RE|5|for the money a very nice piece. easy to assemble and install too.
B00BTLFQVM|5|works great
B00W6IZ79I|5|Fit perfectly look great
B002UC2Q0S|5|Really liked these.  Much better than the plastic ones.
B000KKLJSC|5|Had to look everywhere for one of these after breaking the one I had. ( completely my doing) this one is slightly different then the one I had but just as good. These are excellent for cleaning off trucks , service trucks and box trucks as well as the wife's suv
B000FG8B2I|5|bright as hell  great item
B006BDGDXI|1|didn't work
B002PQQ970|5|easy installation per my brother!
B00N58M6CO|5|Great product
B00U7L4ZOE|5|Fit perfect & works great! 7 months later and still working great
B003AT4RDO|5|Little bit time consuming. Pry 2 hours + or - . Longest time was running the wire to the battery from the rear or Vehicle. Ran mine under body by frame figured lot easier than in the cabin. Worked first time no problems.Do want to have extra zip ties as as every one else says that don't send enough.
B005YP38EQ|5|Worked perfect
B00JIIZCM6|5|I bought this for use on my saddles.  I leave the saddle on the horse, take a soft cloth, and moments later its clean.  Works really well and is not heavy.
B007KCX0IU|4|They fit the car exactly like they should.  If we experience any problems, I will update the review.  We bought them to replace a missing light.  They look factory original.
B000OZS9Y0|5|These will fit a can-am commander but are tight. These appear to be good quality for the money.
B00A56KSMO|5|Excellent
B0031I86E0|5|Perfect fit.
B00E1SLN30|5|this is an easy review all the parts fit no problem I was done with my brake job in an hour
B000NJ39ZG|5|Excellent product. The base fabric appears to be the same heavy material as my Carefree awing, just coated using a different process. My favorite part is that it can be rolled up with the awning making it self storing.
B000C5YD42|5|Exact fit (Toyota Avalon XLS 2003)!  The Sensor comes with anti-seize lube, so all you need is the tools and the time to install.
B000C55SXW|5|Great
B00HZOC23W|5|Fits my 2014 pathfinder perfectly.
B004OV9X40|4|Good for the price
B001AGSYJM|1|I purchased an entire exhaust assembly from Walker using one of the parts diagrams on their site made specifically for my car.  Little did I know that they don't even offer one of the parts labelled on the diagram, so the assembly didn't even fit right.  What's the point of buying specific assembly parts if you're going to need to cut custom pipe just to get the bloody thing to work?
B00D9C2CDO|4|Okay, as the posts say here, you get what you pay for.  Overall good for the price.  I decided to buy extra straps to strap my luggage down more securely since I only had side rails.  I did not try it in the rain since it was weather proof but not rain proof.  Overall good protection for items.
B0058FETAY|5|gift for myson
