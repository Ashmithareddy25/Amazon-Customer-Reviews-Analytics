0060763280|1|The whole book is based on Mantras with little tangible content. The entire book could be condensed to one page. If you're into the Tony Robbins Motivational style content this book may be for you. Eker seams to follow that type of format. I am not a fan of cherry picking examples where some techniques have worked for some people. Eker uses this to pad out his book and to stimulate motivation in his reader however this is not scientific approach and provide little value one week after this book is back on the bookshelf.
B001CTDH4Y|5|I have to admit, I love chihuahuas before the film came out.  And they are not bad little dogs, for the fact that I have a female speckled chihuahua.  You truly have to be a dog lover to enjoy the aspects of this movie, and realize that dogs have emotions that we as humans often overlook, and misjudge. Although I to say that the only thing that the movie could do without is the popping of puppies at the end because there are so many dogs out there without homes, and puppy mills are filled with chihuahua puppies.  Yet, now the ending makes sense because the new BHC 2 movie, Chloe and Papi have five little babies.<br /><br />Also, my chi loves to watch this with me, because she loves seeing her kind on the screen.<br /><br />Do not get any kind of creature unless you are prepared to take care of a child.

B0050R0YB8|5|Pretty outstanding lego set. Took over 8 hours to construct, but was probably the most fun i have had building a lego set in a long time. When fully constructed it's a true showpiece!<br /><br />The only less then outstanding qualities of this set are the bottom of the ship, and the overall slightly lower detail. The original UCS Star Destroyer had some pretty good detail because of it's scale, but if this were to be made to the same scale it would be 15 feet long, so the detail isn't quite as good. The bottom of the ship is especially guilty of this, as other reviewers have mentioned, and has almost no detail at all (it's totally flat!)<br /><br />Aside from that, if you are looking for an eye-catcher, or that massive showpiece, or have an extra 8-11 hours of free time that you need to fill with lots of lego and/or money, then this UCS is for you!

0373834454|3|This is one of the earlier Heyer romances and, while it displays many hallmarks of her signature style -- the language, the references to current styles, the immersion in the period -- and begins delightfully, the parts  don't quite come together.  Lord Rule makes a charming hero but, in the  end, Horry is too childish to make a satisfying romantic heroine.  The  material -- young bride with improvident brother tries to salvage her  whirlwind marriage to an older man -- is handled more successfully in April  Lady.  A more satisfying child bride is Hero Wantage of Friday's Child (a  book which boasts one of the great opening scenes of all time, plus a  terrific screwball finale).  Read this one for the hero, not the heroine.

B000F1IQN2|5|Speilberg surprised me with this.  It is a truly open-minded story based on the aftermath of the Munich Olympic massacre in 1972.  It would have been easy to villainize the Palestinians for this act.  And they certainly would have earned it for what they did.  But Speilberg uses the atrocity to illustrate that there are in fact legitimate and understandable issues on both sides.  And only when we really look at that can we move toward peace. Politics aside though is it a great film on it's own?  Yes!  Especially if you like femme fatales- that Dutch assasin- wow!  I would have said f-it and let her bribe me into not killing her.  This is a great action-adventure/drama with some great comedic bits thrown in as well.  I am not going to spoil it by recapping the storyline.  Just see it.

B000GPIPT2|5|-This review pertains to the Frankenstein: 75th Anniversary Edition DVD-    Mary Shelley's classic horror story, [[ASIN:0393964582 Frankenstein]], has been dramatized countless times since the novel's publication in 1816. The first dramatization, a melodramatic stage play from the early 1820s, was called Presumption: The Fate of Frankenstein. The play resonated with audiences as it greatly emphasized the themes of scientific advances conflicting with Christian ideologies, of man's ego violating the laws of nature, and of ambition overwhelming conscience. A century later, in the year 1927, a playwright named Peggy Webling used similar themes in her adaptation, which was the primary source of inspiration for the classic Universal film. Garrett Fort, who also wrote the screenplay for Dracula, and Francis Edward Faragoh, wrote the film's screenplay. The screenplay was based on Peggy Webling's play, as well as on a produced play that was never produced by John L. Balderston.  To say that the film had a troubled production is an understatement. Originally to be directed by Robert Florey and starring [[ASIN:B0009X770E Béla Lugosi]], Frankenstein was ultimately directed by James Whale and starred [[ASIN:B000FWHW8Q Boris Karloff]]. James Whale had made a name for himself with the films Journeys End and Waterloo Bridge. Both Karloff and Whale can be accredited for the film's status as enduring classic. Whale, who was something of an outcast himself, understood how to create flawed characters that the audience would still sympathize and empathize with. Karloff, who was at the time an underpaid, unknown, and hardworking actor, brought a sense of innocence and vulnerability to the role of Frankenstein's Monster.  Joining Boris Karloff was a wonderful group of actors including Mae Clark as Elizabeth, John Boles as Victor Moritz, Edward Van Sloan as Doctor Waldman, Dwight Frye as Fritz, and Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein. Clive was a tragic figure, both in the film and in reality. He died before his fortieth birthday, not a full year after the release of the sequel [[ASIN:078323502X The Bride of Frankenstein]].  The greatest stars of Frankenstein were Boris Karloff, Jack Pierce, and Kenneth Strickfaden. Jack Pierce created the brilliant makeup for the Frankenstein Monster as well as most of the other classic Universal monsters and Kenneth Strickfaden created the electrical apparatuses seen in the iconic scene where Frankenstein creates the monster in his laboratory. The electrical equipment, which served no real function other to dazzle audiences, was featured in many films all the way up into the 1970s when it appeared in the affectionate spoof [[ASIN:B000G6BLWE Young Frankenstein]].    The story follows an obsessed young doctor named Henry Frankenstein, who along with his hunchbacked assistant Fritz stole corpses from their graves and used their body parts to construct a Monster. Originally Frankenstein wanted nothing more than to advance science to the point where the effects of death could be reversed, but his noble ambitions turned to blasphemous conceit and his creation would take on a life of its own. Frankenstein sends Fritz to a university to steal the brain of a genius, which will be given to Frankenstein's creation. However Fritz drops the brain and replaces it with another. The new brain is a dysfunctional one, that of a criminal.  Meanwhile Henry's fiancée, Elizabeth and his best friend, Victor learn that Henry's become reclusive and secretive. Along with Henry's mentor, the dogmatic Doctor Waldman, they travel to Henry's laboratory on one fateful night. When they arrive Henry seems fanatical and possessed with a mania. He insists that they stay and witness his grand achievement. That night Frankenstein gives birth (figuratively, not literally) to a pathetic creature, born of the components he gathered from the graves that he burglarized. Waldman, Victor, and Elizabeth are horrified. Yet they've no idea of the horrors in store for them. After coming to his senses, Henry acknowledges what he's done but the Monster has escaped and is rampaging through the nearby villages. Can it be stopped or will Frankenstein's Monster live forever?    This monstrously good DVD includes an audio commentary with film historian Sir David Frayling, an audio commentary with film historian Rudy Behlmer, Karloff: The Gentle Monster documentary, The Frankenstein Files: How Hollywood Made a Monster documentary, Monster Tracks trivia, Boo!: A Short Film, Universal Horror feature-length documentary, Frankenstein Archives poster montage with music, and theatrical trailer.

B0000633T6|4|I was expecting more of a thriller.  Spy Game turned out to be far more cerebral than action-packed.  It offered interesting insight into the CIA, foreign relations and espionage.  Redford and Pitt gave solid performances as mentor and protege in a world where the choices are neither clear nor easy.  As someone else said, this is a movie you need to watch carefully, otherwise it is easy to get lost.

B000FQ4M58|5|This album is simply awesome. Awesome in the true sense of that much overused word. Great music, powerful lyrics, soaring vocals. Meat Loaf's voice can reach out and grab you in a vice-like grip that you can't escape. He'll make you smile, cheer, and cry. Just compare his version of It's All Coming Back To Me Now to Celine Dion's. Her's is good, a lot of vocal power, but it has no emotional power compared to this one. This one pulls you in, makes you feel the loss, the longing. That's real power.  <br /> <br />Get the album. You won't regret it.

B000IZJ1KC|5|If you love Heavy Metal you will love this album. This band consists of various members of other famous metal groups (Gorgoroth, Enslaved and Immortal). While all those bands are of a darker strain of metal (black metal namely), this album is straight out heavy metal at its finest. If you are a black metal fan or a fan of the named bands above, this album may not be for you. Abbath (the singer) keeps his black metal style of vocalization, but gone from this album is the erratic and noisy, fast paced, musical structure of black metal and introduced are composed and thought out structured songs. Each song is strong from beginning to end.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this album, is after hearing the bonus tracks that are not on this album, I am dissapointed that those other three songs were not included on this album. They are three gems that are missing from this cd for whatever foolish reason.

B003O86FMW|5|I think this is one of the most exciting young adult books i have read since Harry Potter. Highly Reccomended!
B008CLI4N4|5|I really roasted the book from which this television series was taken, mainly because of its poor writing, many grammatical errors, needless and endless descriptions of meals and wearing apparel, and episodic structure, which destroyed dramatic tension. As it turns out, what didn't work for me on paper works spectacularly on film. This is probably the most well-done television series I have ever seen, with casting and production values equal to almost all theatrical offerings.<br /><br />The episodic structure, typical of soap operas which follow multiple characters and story lines simultaneously, works well for screen writing, particularly when viewed in a collection like this instead of in week-to-week installments on television. The casting is extraordinary, for the most part, particularly for the actors portraying Eddard Stark and the dwarf Tyrion Lannister. Only one major player, the actress portraying Cersei Lannister Baratheon, does not seem to fit the part as written in the books, being too hardened and old looking and not nearly as creepily depraved as she should be.<br /><br />As in the book, completely unnecessary and graphic sexual scenes are introduced with some regularity. As I am an older female, rather than a young susceptible male, these all seemed to be rather more humorous than titillating, and seemed to cheapen the storytelling somewhat by sensationalism. This aspect may discourage some parents from sharing this with their older teenagers, which is unfortunate, since many would certainly enjoy it.<br /><br />In an age when most of television is reality garbage, I applaud HBO.

0679746048|4|“The only way to stay sane is to go a little crazy.”<br /><br />After a phone call to her boyfriend to advise him of her impending suicide, Susan swallowed 50 aspirin then remembered her mother asking her to pick up milk and headed for the store. Her halfhearted suicide attempt, she states, was not an attempt at death but rather an attempt  at partial suicide to get rid of the part of herself that no longer wished to live. A year later on June 15, 1967, she has an appointment with a new psychiatrist and twenty minutes later she’s agreeing to a two week stay at McLean, a psychiatric hospital, for a rest the psychiatrist insists she needs. She remains there until she’s eventually discharged on January 3, 1969.<br /><br />‘In a strange way we were free. We’d reached the end of the line. We had nothing more to lose. Our privacy, our liberty, our dignity: All of this was gone and were stripped down to the bare bones of our selves.’<br />Girl, Interrupted is a collection of nonlinear essays that tell of her time spent at McLean hospital. She describes in detail the constant room checks, the punishments, the medications and treatments, the hovering nurses and how their memories of privacy quickly became a thing of the past. The writing is simplistic but powerful and quietly brings to life the claustrophobic horrors of being incarcerated. What was truly startling to me though was the ease in which Susan found herself in this position. Twenty minutes spent with a new psychiatrist and he quickly classified her as having Borderline Personality Disorder and is putting her in a taxi to the local mental hospital. The same hospital that at one time housed Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton and even Sylvia Plath.<br /><br />‘…my discharge sheet, at line 41, Outcome with Regard to Mental Disorder, reads “Recovered.”‘<br /><br />These essays are not only a glimpse into life inside a mental institution but are an insightful look into “recovery”. Borderline personality disorder isn’t something that someone can be cured of so her recovery is more or less watching her come to terms with her disorder and learning how to live with it. Girl, Interrupted is a distressing read but one that is replete with immense strength and perseverance.ity disorder isn’t something that someone can be cured of so her recovery is more or less watching her come to terms with her disorder and learning how to live with it.

B00001QEE7|5|This is such a great film and it works on so many different levels.  <br />On one level, it reminds me of the universal desire and need for transcendence, to look beyond the confines of our everyday surroundings.  Ariel is a dweller of the underworld, symbolically represented by the sea.  The sea is replete with marvelous treasures and bounteously provides Ariel with all of her material needs.  Indeed, she would never be in want of material possessions because as a princess the whole sea belongs to her.  Even so, she yearns for another world qualitatively different from her own, the world of humans above her.  This need for transcendence is not prompted by any rational instinct, but the common passion to break through the mundane into a brave new world of the extraordinary.  Ariel's aching for transformation and transcendence of the everyday world of the sea is the exact same longing that all people experience whether they aspire on the spiritual level to reach heaven or on a secular level, to revolutionize the world in hopes of achieving a utopia.<br />The transformation that allows Ariel to become a land dweller requires a sacrifice: she must forfeit her voice to the evil sea had, Ursula.  This is excellent symbolism.  Kierkegaard discusses how as finite beings, we can only communicate in finite languages.  For instance, linguistically, our speech is limited by its form: a Frenchman only speaking Français can communicate no better to a German speaker than he could to a pelican.  But on a deeper level, as humans we can only communicate in the language of logic and reason and yet these systems of communication are painfully limited.  We long to speak a universal, transcendent, divine language, but we fall painfully short; if we could speak the language of the infinite and divine, we would no longer be human because as humans we by definition finite.  If we as finite human beings were instantly transferred to a terrain of the infinite, like heaven, our limited, finite and human means of communication would render us unable to communicate.  With words only, how would you communicate with a transcendent, immaterial being like an angel and how would an angel communicate with you?  In other worlds, like Ariel, we too would be without the ability to communicate, without a voice.  Remembering how our painfully limited and encumbering our means of communication would be if we ever had to communicate with angels helps to enhance our viewing experience by aiding us in imagining Ariel's plight as our own.  <br />What really struck me about this film is that what can bridge the gap between worlds is not the linguistics of a certain spoken dialect, but the language of love and empathy.  Even without a voice, Ariel is able to communicate with Eric the prince through her innate kindness and sympathy.  This film is a marvelous testament to the power of human warmth against the alienation, fragmentation and silence of modern times.

7115142343|5|Saw this movie for the third time , and understood its greatness. I won't go over the details of the movie, others have done that, just add my observations. It was about the question \\"Is The Pen Mightier Than The Sword?\\" and as the song later says \\" The Man who shot Liberty Valence was the bravest of them all.\\" In other words what constitutes bravery. Well some notable scenes for the pen vs sword controvery intended by the author. The scene where steward as the elected official and school teacher , has the masses and protection of the majority of the town and the towns folk always helping him and looking to him for leadership. We have the other person, John Wayne who used and claimed the sword , end up self destructing. So its not the gun that's bad philosophy but how you use it and who is pulling the trigger in the end that matters. Yet, it was the sword in the end that changed the history and let the pen accomplish its feats, When John Wayne killed Liberty Valence. We also have the question of what is bravery so well demonstrated in this movie. Jimmy Stuart might not have killed Liberty Valence, but was brave in standing up to him even if not armed well. In contrast, even though John Wayne used a \\"trick\\" to kill Valence (standing in the dark with a bigger gun... a rifle) he in the end was the brave one - not because as the song later says he shot Liberty Valence (that was the stuff of legends) rather because he gave up the thing he loved most because he loved his girl. If he did not save Jimmy Steward, he would have been Very Miles Husband. Wow, what a great movie with so many statements being made about human nature. This, The Searchers, and Horse Soldiers, are my favorite John Wayne movies. This for the message, The Searchers for the beauty and story, and Horse Soldiers for the pure adventure.

B0055B7IPE|5|I bawled, I sobbed...ocular waterworks in full glory. \\"Up\\" presented an existential message in the form of a simple, animated story. This film was definitely more about analyzing the goals we set out to achieve and the disillusionment we encounter through struggle while growing older, i.e. the human condition, rather than flight and adventure, per se; nonetheless, a most wonderful journey for all ages.  Succinctly, this is a well-crafted introduction to children of the value of life's obstacles.

B00BPBWYM0|5|Midnight Blues is the combination of two Hardy albums, One-Nine-Seven-Zero, Francoise Hardy (also known as If You Listen) and the single, Loving You, from En Anglais. I don't think the songs do justice to her voice; struggling with an unfamiliar language, Hardy manages, nonetheless, to inject a breathy voice full of feeling for the songs' intentions. The arrangements, often inventive and executed with aplomb, bring a worthy punctuation to her interpretations of a varied selection from Leonard Cohen's Suzanne (one of the weaker results, in my opinion) to Bown, Bown, Bown (one of the stronger, I think). Brulure is becoming my favorite, and it might be because it's the only song on the group that Hardy sings in French and has the greater depth of her feeling. All the same, songs such as Randy Newman's I Thing It's Gonna Rain Today or Buffy Sainte-Marie's Take My Hand For A While, have an infectious orchestration. Songs such as  Loving You or 'Til the Morning Comes might seem to jar at first, but keep listening...it won't be long before the entire collection becomes addictive; and, as you listen (even to If You Listen), the whole of the compilation will be a welcome, fluid and sincere emotional experience not to be missed.

B00A0NOF7G|3|In the first installment of the Lexy Baker Bakery Mystery from Leighann Dobbs, Killer Cupcakes, we were introduced to Lexy Baker and her dog Sparkles. Lexy owned a local bakery with her best friend Cassie, when she'd gotten embroiled into a messy mystery. First, she met her new neighbor, hunky Detective Jack Perillo, who was also a local cop. But when she was a chief suspect of poisoning her ex-boyfriend, it was up to Lexy to clear her name with the help of her grandmother and her friends, and save her bakery business, before it was too late.
B00HZ0SC4E|5|As usual, Matthew McConaughey at his best.  I enjoyed it.
B00BMUVW5O|5|I love reading this book.  It is very heart-warming and touching story about a ginger cat and James, his friend.  The book was simply yet well-written, and I read it within 1 day.  I hope to hear more about their future adventures.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who love animals and how the love and relationship with their pets can heal and help their lives.

B00847KFDS|5|I'm in true awe of John and his continued mastery of his music genre! He got the idea for this album from his wife! Pure genius with each recording and the individuals and groups he performs with! For me one highlite is the duet with Bob Seger (including Seger's keyboardist Craig Frost) PURE BLISS! John keeps on rocking! This is a CAN'T MISS ALBUM!
B00INCUG7Y|5|This really is a fun game. Well done ASG. Got to work on CD2.
B009R659L8|5|As usual I could not put this Mary Higgins Clark book down until I finished.  MHC has a. way of weaving a story to keep you guessing. Even when you think you know the answer you are never quit sure until the very end.  She is one of my favorite mystery authors.

B000JMKQX0|3|I got the impression Brooks wanted to draw the characters together beyond their experience with the war.  Towards the end, it felt forced. The \\"good byes\\" section almost seemed like an afterthought.<br /><br />And finally, I felt as though Brooks wanted to interject his personal feelings about capitalism, politics, and make a societal observation.  I say that's his prerogative, but whereas Mary Shelly was able to weave her stance subtly into Frankenstein...Brooks forced the issue.<br /><br />Maybe this is what I get for reading a zombie book...
B00004STPT|5|So many different great theme s in this soundtrack,never get tired of listening to it.Love the &quot;Now We Are Free &quot; song sooo beautiful!
1595141979|3|What I loved:  I really enjoyed the ghost storyline in this book and finding out more about Anna (how she relates to Rose). The history of what has happened before and how it is correlating to events happening in the present was well written and enjoyable.  I also liked the friendship growing between Christian and Rose. The ending of the book was emotionally powerful--will only tell you to grab a hanky!<br /><br />What I liked:  I liked the whole book but it wasn't as good a read as the first two.  Then again, I think it really served it's purpose to move along the story, give you some background, and give you a glimpse into what is in store for Rose/Lissa after graduation.  I think it also grew some of the characters that were minor before but growing in importance: Adrian and Eddie.<br /><br />What was so-so:  Lissa--maybe it was because this really showed the strain that the bond has on Rose but I thought Lissa was being selfish this book.  I know Rose is her guardian but the end scene between the two made me want to scream at Lissa to quit being a spoiled little princess(up until then--I think I gave her slack due to Rose not being communicative about the bond, the stresses, and other things going on in her life).<br /><br />Why I gave it a 3.5:  This is still a very good book just not as strong as the others.  I think the series will go back to the 4 range in the next book.  I would recommend this to any YA or PNR reader (please read in order though).<br /><br />[...]
B000AGTPUK|5|I decided to make a tradition with my kids to watch this every Christmas and I was able to surprise them this year by buying them the movie so we can watch it as many times as we want instead of having to rent it.

B0084IG8TM|5|One cannot deny the attraction of the Hunger Games movie and the great casting and screenplay based upon the popular book series.  What makes this DVD set unique is the very detailed 'making of' segments on the extra disk.  It is about as long as the movie itself if you watch it all!  It covers every angle of making this fascinating movie, from location scouting, to set design, costumes, special effects, martial arts and weapons training for the cast, the director's vision, how some elements were added for clarity that were not in the book, and how the movie is (to my mind) actually a better vision of Susan Collin's world than might have resulted at others' hands.  The amount of thought and work that goes into making a movie is clearly evident, and the supplemental videos will take you through the entire production, and beyond to the opening and fan events after, plus interviews with most of the main cast.  Highly recommended.
B003VVAE4W|5|I've loved this TV show since when I was in high school. Veronica is soooo cool, and the story is awesome. This has all mystery, romance, and friendship, etc..... I highly recommend you to watch this!!
B001DJLD1M|4|I like it but the only problem is that I live in australia and my country code is 4.<br />Amazon sent me DVD's for a contry code 1 and none of my Australian products allow me to watch it.<br />Is there any way of getting it replaced?<br />sincerely,<br />Lehel.
B00005JKHP|4|I have to admit I was a little disappointed. There seems to have been dialogue removed that only makes some scenes more awkward.  For instance, right after the transporter accident Kirk asks Starfleet if they have them....but now there is no response from Starfleet and Kirk continues by telling Starfleet where to reach their families (as if someone was listening).  Next, the moment when Kirk and McCoy are talking in Kirks quarters and Uhura interupts to let them know that a ship is approaching and seems to be coming along side.  However in this version there is no signal to kirk, but he orders the computer to activate his viewscreen anyway (as if he had ESP) and to make matters worse the editing starts Uhura's dialogue halfway into her converstion.  The last problem I noticed is way Kirk calls the Enterprise from V'ger and asks the crew to pull up any data on NASA/Voyager 6.  The problem is that Kirks request is cutoff the moment the view changes to Uhura and the crew listening to him and then the scene followed up with Decker agreeing that that must be what V'ger wants (well what was it...Kirk doesn't get a chance to say because its on the editing room floor).  The result is a awkward pause just when the crew seems to be listening intently to nothing!  Don't get me wrong,  I love most of the re-editing and new CG effects but this missing dialogue really hurt this DVD and it didn't save anything on running time of the movie.  This probably because the scenes in question just go on without it and we are just left with these strange moments of silence.  Please let me know that I'm not going crazy and that it's also obvious to you also.
B000ETQRCM|1|i've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code'.  this band was just getting worse with every album.  eventually, i caught on and stopped wasting my $.  i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright.  who the @$#%@ are these dumb reviewers?  are they getting paybacks?  is this politics or music?  live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that.  they still know how to play, but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive, appealing songs.  also, maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich isn't helping!  only put 1 song on my mp3 players...= 1 star.

B00FAPF5U0|5|Fun! Addictive
B0019N95IK|5|Enterprise could have been the ST franchise's most interesting series too bad Rick Berman & company failed to capitalized on it. The Vulcans should have been included right from the get go instead of the temporal cold war and the boring Zenis aliens. The 4th season is of course the high light of the series by then it was too little too late and Berman completely ruined the series finale(every Trekies know what I am referring to). I still give it 5 stars the blue ray discs are sharp and clear even the cgi are quite good.
B0073V7YTY|5|I was warned not to use it for professional purposes as the range of sound is limited to the microphone of the tablet.<br />But as it is its very interesting to notice how small consistent sounds build up to quite a high noise level. Such as fans, air conditioners and other electric appliances.
B00ID4I0FM|4|I enjoyed the movie and some of special effects are good. Developed around a story line that I can relate to as well.

B00003W8NM|5|''There is too much violence in Fight Club!&quot; remark the cowardly reviewers who mock this brilliant piece of fiction. If this is so, they clearly have a weak knowledge of film, as there are MANY MANY more films out there that are 10 times as violent. <br />I'm not going to bother to write a pretentious, opressive review, and instead tell it to ya straight.<br />Fight club is the tale of an unnamed office worker (played by Norton)- a slave to money and merchandise, living in somewhat of a shrine to IKEA. Bored, disillusioned, and suffering from insomnia, he attends cancer support groups to wallow in sympathy and self pity with others, to alleviate the turmoil of his sad lonley exsistence. <br />His life changes, however, when he meets Tyler Durden- a hedonistic soap salesman- who is literally everything that Norton's character isn't. <br />the rest of the story documents the growth of 'Fight Club'- an underground bare knuckle fighting network that Tyler and the narrator create, and riddled with Tylers twisted anarchic philosophy, the film compels due to its slick direction and sublimely satisfying visceral content.<br />yes, it is violent, but life is violent, and you cant spend your days sheltered from the facts of life.

0440219078|4|The Giver is a great science fiction book for young adults to read because it deals with tales and stories of human society from the past and tries to enlighten them in the present and future.  The main characters were Jonas, who was a boy of twelve, has been selected to be the Receiver of Memory and  The Giver, who once used to be the receiver and now has to give his power  to Jonas.  Jonas doesn't think it's fair that he has to suffer the pain of  remembering so many secrets of the past while everyone else isn't.  In  their world, there were no colors, no pain, no love, and there's barely any  choice to do what you want.  After holding so much power of remembrance  Jonas doesn't think that the world he lives in is a perfect world after  all.  So in the end Jonas and the The Giver makes a plan to escape the  utopian world to find freedom and true life.
B004W2UBYW|5|Good
B00IAV05WY|5|This series is a guilty pleasure of mine. I enjoyed the first 3 books and was eager to get my hands on the fourth. The author does a great job giving the reader consistently hot content. Jenny goes through some new experiences in Named and Shamed. It's never boring! I liked the other pony girls too. Well-written erotica with good characters.
B004J713JW|5|Aside from the fact that I was at the Friday night concert (so excuse me for my biased opinion), I think that this was probably the most memorable concert that I've ever been to (to date).  It was full of energy and excitement and the star-studded special guests were fantastic.  The blu-ray provides the closest experience to actually having been in the crowd. I was at first upset that it took almost 3 years to be sold, however, they really did take their time and execute a fantastic product in sound and in picture quality (even though some will complain that it isn't in 1080p but rather only in 1080i).    But I digress. The main reason that I am posting this is to make you all aware that some stores are already carrying this item - and I don't mean illegally! I went to my local best buy today to purchase the CD/DVD combo - one of the sales associates told me that the blu ray was arriving today and she then went a step further and retrieved it from the truck! About 8 or 9 other fans, including myself, jumped on the copies as she struggled to carry the stack of discs from the receiving dock.    Anyway, don't wait - get this and get it on blu-ray for the closest experience to actually having been there.    I miss Shea and this concert will always be remembered by many as a grand 'ol farewell to the aging mecca.  (if only the mets had avoided a 2nd consecutive season-end collapse, i wonder what might have been for the playoffs and maybe world series. however, those are thoughts for another blog and another time!)
B00Y6QF0PE|2|When I first heard about this book being released I was excited finally the chance to see Christian side. I honestly felt like E L James put in ten original sentences and just decided to publish Fifty Shades of Gray all over again just to make extra money. I was looking for more insight into Christian darker past before he came in contact with Ana. I understand that Ana was his light that gave him a better life but reading it over and over again when we all knew the end result was exhausting. I am  not sure if they are going to be doing all the books but if they do there needs to be some vast improvements to the format that she is sticking too. I giver her credit for attempting something and trying to make her fans happy. For those of you haven't purchased it yet I suggest that you just let your girlfriends tell you about the ten seconds of extra contents that was in this novel and save that money to go out and buy more posters of Jamie Dornan for your bedroom.
B007IXWL2C|3|I wasnt going to purchase this i bought it on accident i thought i had clicked the first book in the trilogy but it was a mistake anyways i decided to keep it since im going to read all of them so its ok. (:

B002JXK5VU|4|It took a while for me to notice this show.  When I watched the first episode, I became interested.  It is an interesting blend of sci-fi, drama, and comedy.  The cast is talented to pull this off.
B000069HK2|5|How can I say this? These guys are totally new and seem to have came out of nowhere with a unique refined style. They aren't a copycat band or really a \\"punk\\", \\"emo\\" or \\"hard rock\\" band, they, simply put, are NEW. From the soft, rhythmic Blue and Yellow to the insane yelling of Box Full of Sharp Objects [\\"I feel stronger....AND SHARPER!!!\\"], you will not be able to believe how tight and original this band sounds. If you like \\"screemo\\" or \\"punk\\" music you will like this; over-all, it is a masterpiece that shows this band getting the credit it deserves.
B00BD99JMW|5|Now with this book...I was sad that this series was ending and the ending of this book just planned sucked. Well I mean it didn't suck but I was quite sad that Veronica did what she did with this book. This book just like the last two had me guessing and sucked in all the way through.<br /><br />It also shows that just because you have the technology to control some human beings in a controlled environment that you shouldn't do that because no matter what human beings always go back to the way that we were. Granted not all the times but most of the times yes. In this book we also see some things through Four's eyes which I have to say is pretty entertaining. Tris and her brother Caleb learn more about their mother. Okay the part of their mother that she kept hidden from them since she couldn't tell anyone about her being from the &#34;outside&#34; world and about her life even before that.<br /><br />We also get to know more about what being a Divergent is really about. Everything about this book is pretty awesome and I say that it is such a good book that everyone should read if they have read the first two.
1476719071|5|This is my second time reading this novel.  Loved it just as much the second time as I did the first time.
B0088W6LGY|5|Best of the Stargate series yet. Love the characters and the story lines. Special effects are terrific.
B007FG9LIE|4|I REALLY enjoyed this book and am finishing up #3. I lost sleep so I could finish it. Interesting trilogy that keeps you guessing all the way through. You root for the characters and remain riveted all the way through. I definitely recommend reading this. Supposedly a series is coming next year on Fox, will be interested to see how they handle things.
B00127RAJY|5|This workout will kick your butt, literally! It is a balanced mix of cardio and toning exercises, all targeted to work the entire body. There are three 20 minute workouts (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and you WILL be challenged, and you WILL feel the burn. Jillian is no nonsense, realistic, and will push you. I have only done Level 1 at this point, but so far I really like it! For example, I like that she doesn't offer the modified version of the jumping jack, stating that she has 400 pound people doing it. And if a 400 pound person can do it, then so can you! The only \\"tradional\\" modified exercise is with push-ups, which is definitely helpful for people like myself who are not used to or even like doing push-ups. I have found that I can pump out 20 push-ups now without a problem! Jillian helped me realize through this DVD that I can do it. And if I can do it, then anyone can do it. Out of all the workout DVDs I have done THIS is the best one out there. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a challenge to their exercise routine.
B0000028UK|5|Eddie and the boys have released several strong albums, but Vs. showcases the band at the height of their powers.  A quantam leap beyond Ten, this album proved that the Seattle-based quartet weren't gonna be just some  flash in the &quot;grunge&quot; pan.  The acoustic-based tunes,  &quot;Daughter&quot; and &quot;Elderly Woman&quot; are the highlights here,  but the signature ballast and boogie tracks are in the mix as well.  It's  fitting that at the height of their popularity, Pearl Jam managed to  deliver their finest hour on record as well.
B004SJ3AXI|5|I really like the game it has been a real joy for my grandchildren, friends and myself as we all play an share our scores<br />Thank you
B00DR0PDNE|4|I love it for everything, but why do AVI files have to be such a pain? I am an engineer/IT/nerd and it drove me insane trying to figure out some workarounds for AVIs. It should have AVI support inherently IMO. Netflix and Hulu do work great though.
B007A4SDCG|5|A must read for every writer, artist, entrepreneur, anyone with a passion they pursue.
B000GFRJ58|5|When Ronnie Lane was having financial difficulty he asked Pete Townshend for a loan. Pete said no. He then suggested that Pete produce his solo album and contribute songs to a solo album Townshend had a counter proposal; they record an album together. The result is the marvelous \\"Rough Mix\\" which features both songwriters in top form and meshing to create a unique sythesizer of both their sounds. The album sounds like a collison of these two unique songwriters and their bands (Lane was a member at one time of the Faces and The Small Faces)than just about anything either one of them created by themselves. The production by Glyn Johns and musical contributions from John Entwhistle, Eric Clapton, Charlie Watts and Rabbit makes this marvelous musical confection come together and gel.<br /><br />Does this album sound better than the previously mastered version? Yeah it's improved but only for the 5.1 mix. The Redbook layer (which sometimes doesn't play in CD players) is brighter, louder and more compressed. We get the original album remastered for CD with video interviews with producer Johns and Townshend on the DVD-audio side of things. There are also stills from Townshend's collection of the recording of the album. The 5.1 mix of the album sounds quite good as well although I find myself listening a bit more to the stereo CD side only because I tend to listen to music much more in the car than I do at home.<br /><br />The booklet has information on the recording of the album in a brief essay as well as the original lyrics for all the songs. The big find though is three previously unreleased songs two by Lane and one by Townshend. \\"Good Question\\" builds on a demo from \\"Scoop\\" that Townshend recorded called \\"Brrr\\". Both \\"Only You\\" and \\"Silly Little Man\\" are exceptional Lane tunes that add to his musical legacy.<br /><br />A warning to Townshend/Who fans; don't except \\"Empty Glass\\" this album has much more in common in tone, feel and sound to Townshend's \\"Who Came First\\" album than his later albums.<br /><br />Pete's in great voice throughout. Townshend's songs tend to rock out a bit more than Lane's but the two provide perfect balance to each other here. My advice--if you're going to listen to the Redbook CD layer a lot stick with your original CD.album than his later albums.<br /><br />Pete's in great voice throughout.

1423165691|5|I originally saw this book at The Writer's Stop in Disney's Hollywood Studio and fell in love.  Since it is rather large, I decided to buy it on Amazon when I got home rather than lugging it through the park and airport.  It is absolutely beautiful, from the leather cover to the inside sketches, and a great keepsake for any Disney fan.  The sketches are interesting to look at and provide an inside look at how some of Disney's most famous characters are drawn.  If you're a Disney fan, I suggest buying this book, as it is beautiful, or it would make a great gift for any Disney fanatic!
1476715904|5|This book started it all for me my love of reading my obsession with books colleen hoover is amazing this is one of my all time favorites
0451239377|4|The Day of the Jackal is not for those raised on Schwarzenegger movies.  There are no destructive car chases, elaborate explosions, or extended hand-to-hand fights.  The hero is not a belligerent risk taker who thrives on violence as he delivers pithy one-liners.  It is not football.  There is thought, preparation, deceptiveness, detective work, and tension throughout the story.  The hero is a modest, underrated detective who can defeat a mastermind assassin, not through brute force but through cunning, persistence, and detective work.  It is chess.<br /><br />The top leaders of a French revolutionary group, who has made repeated attempts to assassinate Charles de Gaul, upon realizing that their group was so heavily infiltrated, chose to hire an outside party to perform the job: one only know as \\"The Jackal.\\"  The Jackal is professional, in that he is smart, methodical, and thorough.  He has planned everything in advance, from the identities he steals, to his travel arrangements, to his contingencies, to his means of escape.  That he has left nothing to chance is clear as every facet of his plot is meticulously described.<br /><br />Upon learning of this plot, the French government has appointed Claude Lebel, an underrated police detective to foil any plot against de Gaul, assuming one exists.  Who is the Jackal?  Is he a real person?  How could he kill de Gaul?  In addition to trying to discover the plot, Lebel is also reporting to a committee of top government officials, political appointments actually, many of whom don't think very highly of him and would rather see him fail.  But Lebel is not a politician. He is not a counter intelligence expert.  He is not flamboyant.  He is a police detective, a profession, who merely does what is told of him, but does it really well.<br /><br />The joy in reading such a book is not so much the mystery.  It is how a police detective can work to unravel an almost perfect plot despite overwhelming micromanagement and in some cases hostility from his superiors.  The aura is deep but intense.  But even more haunting is the possibility that it may actually have been real.es hostility from his superiors.  The aura is deep but intense.  But even more haunting is the possibility that it may actually have been real.
B00UXC49P2|4|I really enjoyed this book, but it threw me for a loop when it ended at 77%.  I didn't realize it was a short story!  When the mayor's wife is found dead in Cottage 6, Liz takes it upon herself to find the killer. Lots of excitement and a cute \\"boxer\\"!  Can't wait to read the next book in the series!
0345803485|3|did not enjoy this series at all - a lot of hype and was so disappointed it did not hold up to its reputation at all
B005LAII3U|5|Though based upon the same short story by Phillip K. Dick, this 2012 version and the 1990 version starring Arnold Schwarzenegger are rather incomparable, even though every one does. The films have different cinematic qualities in every sense.<br /><br />The earlier Schwarzenegger Total Recall was an entertaining hokey joke. Watching it again reminds that Paul Verhoeven tried too hard to cover too many bases in constructing a sci-fi action flick that can hardly take itself seriously. This jumble looks and feels dated, even as it retains its charms.<br /><br />The Collin Ferrell version is a tightly-spun action thriller: Jason Bourne in the land of Blade Runner post-apocalypse. The cameo nods to the earlier version are a quaint touch, but this movie stands on its own as outstanding. The acting, cinematography and directing are all expertly done.<br /><br />In time, the 2012 Total Recall is likely to be more highly considered than it is now. All the negative reviews read like built-in biases; not enjoying a movie on its own merits. Both versions are classic takes, albeit in very different ways.
B0058YPGVQ|5|Season 4 marks the turning point from Biker Drama to a more in depth study of the corrosive effects of power.  Nobody escapes the vortex of violence.  Having watched this again after the end of season 5 it's even more apparent how season 4 sets up the dramatic shifts of season 5 as characters lose their philophical moorings in family and &#34;goodness&#34; and follow their darker sides.
B0043P10CA|5|This is the first Sakamoto music I've heard, and I'm smitten! It's devastatingly ravishing piano music, played beautifully. The first disc is one perfect gem after another, the second disc is more experimental, sound-scapey, but even that was interesting to me, and I usually have no patience for that kind of music. Highly recommend!

0805092994|1|The species that we should be especially concerned about is our own, yet on p. 254 she makes the absurd statement that “with the exception of humans, all the great apes today are facing oblivion;” and on p. 255 states “it’s quite possible that there will be among the great apes not a single representative, except, that is, for us.”<br />Finally, on p. 267 ff. she raises the possibility that our own species is also in trouble, but on p. 260 asserts that “human ingenuity will outrun any disaster human ingenuity sets in motion.”  What hubris!  Then, she reaches the height of absurdity by talking about the possibility of “decamp [ing] to other planets”!!<br />Why is she ignorant of the fact that many climate scientists believe the “end is near” for us if we don’t act soon, and decisively (which, though, is unlikely, given the sort of leadership that we have!)?  For example, given that the Arctic is today’s “canary in the coal mine,” shouldn’t we heed the statement, in 2013, by Arctic climate scientist John B. Davies that our species will be basically extinct by 2040?  (A rhetorical question, of course!)

014242417X|5|I saw the film (never read the book) but was very moved by the story. I purchased the book for my daughter, hoping that she would get involved in the story and do some reading. I picked the right book for her (she is 28) because she really liked it and read it quickly.<br />Would strongly recommend the book, especially for any young adult readers.
B009WO7NQO|5|Got this for my four year old grandson. He loves it. He plays it every day. I've played it also. Additive.
B000002B7M|5|Ah, Ozzy. Total night fanatic. Not only does he sing about Alestar Crowley (a black night dude), but he has a song called &quot;Steal Away (The NIGHT!)&quot;. That song is incredible. In all it's 3 and a half mnutes of glory, it is my favorite Ozzy song. Revaltion is a great song about a dark (dark as night!) future. Great album! NIGHT!
B00003CX8Y|1|The quality of the cd was not good. My grandchild was upset he couldn\\"t see it all.  I was given back my money  very quiclky, I will say that.  Thank you.
B008DM4OTA|5|I have five grandchildren who use my Kindle.  My six year old granddaughter always goes for this game first.  She loves it!
0307476073|1|This book did not hold my interest at all.<br />The author was not sure if she wanted it to be a tell all about her miserable life or a book about her trek.<br />She failed in both aspects.<br />The movie can only be more interesting but I am sure it will be a Hollywood love story with a happy ending.<br />Her characters  may have been real but they were not at all interesting.<br />The interaction between the author and others in the book was so unappealing.<br />Her description about the terrain was very sophomoric.<br />That country out there is beautiful and I never got the feeling that she had even a slight appreciation of it.<br />Long and boring are the 2 words that come to mind when thinking about this book.
B00VRYCGLO|2|Very hard to get into the programs.
B00000IMTF|5|This definitely is the best album by rainbow. Dio sings fantastic on this album(ofcours he always sings fantastic) and the guitarsolo's and keyboardsolo's are great. The album kicks off with 'Tarot Woman'. That is a really good song. It starts with some mysterious keyboard play, and then you slowly hear the guitar becoming louder and louder, and then it breaks out. Great start of the album. Then 'Run with the Wolf', good song too. And at number three you get to hear 'Starstruck'. Another very good song which had been a great hit. So the first three songs are very good, well, it will only get better. <br /> <br />'Do you close your eyes' is good, but all the other songs on this album are better. After that one you get 'Stargazer'. That is definitely the best song on the whole album. I think it's even the best song of all rainbow-songs. 'Stargazor' is just magical. The song always gives me chills and I think it is THE highlight of this album. This album is THE highlight of all Rainbow's albums. I can't really explane more how I feel about 'Stargazor', it's just such a fantastic song. <br /> <br />The last song is 'Light at the Black'. Good song, and the guitarsolo and keyboardsolo are fantastic. So as you can here, this surely is the best Rainbow-album ever. I wont be the only one who will say that, just look at the other reviews and see. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
B00K7C17QW|3|fun
B00BAXFACO|3|It was riveting I liked the second better.
0679745653|4|I'm not going to lie, I bought this book to read Breakfast at Tiffany's. I am a fan of the movie and I wanted to read the actual story, which is very different from the movie but definitely very enjoyable.<br /><br />I didn't expect to much like the rest of the stories because I found myself unable to finish In Cold Blood, not because it was no good but because it was too dark for my taste. But I really loved them! I enjoyed House of Flowers and A Christmas Memory even more than Breakfast at Tiffany's!<br /><br />I really enjoy a good short story for light reading. I also really like a good nostalgic tale, it's sort of like reading someone's journal. There is a common thread of truth in each story that I think people from just about any walk or life or past could identify with in some way. A Christmas Memory was touching to me in particular and I plan to read it every year at Christmas from now on.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00N35P5MW|5|I really enjoys this game, it's challenging and fun.  I also like that if you need it that you can get a hint.  No timer is great also.

B0097GVJWQ|4|I think it drags you in and makes you think. I've played the game over and over, now I just need the 2nd one.
B001N1DPDE|5|Well, its amazing! 1 pound of indestructible material!!! I can't bealive the sharpness! If you are thinking to buy a really good survival knife , this is the one! Im very happy with it! Very nice handle and a great fabrication! I recommend it with my eyes closed!
B008Y6RYDS|4|I rewatched this movie again it seems like every 10 years and it does not disappoint. Good character development and interesting turns as you see these men just want to make it to the big party. Jacck Nicholson as the drunk Southern attorney is one of my favorites of his characters. He brings them to life.<br /><br />Some depiction of standard 60s drug uand alcohol use with brief nudity and violence. Would be rated PG-13 today.
0140067477|2|I picked up this book because it seemed so charming. The author took the stories and characters of A.A. Milne and juxtaposed them with the Taoist teachings of people such as Lao Tzu.  <br /> <br />Pooh as western Taoist starts off interestingly enough but halfway through it I came to the realization that it was making me want to just read the actual Milne, who was frankly probably a genius writer. Those were great books with great characters, each with their own type of intelligence. <br />  <br />Then about two thirds through the book, it just becomes insulting. The author is against pretty much anything useful. Rather than believing in the give and take of Ying and Yang (or any other name it may go under) he's against intellectuals who are secretly foolish for trying to figure anything about the world, against people who work hard and care about their jobs or contributions (again that's just foolish), people who enjoy sports or exercise...heck he's against leaving your house or caring about the rest of the world. I understand the idea behind the Busy Backson rant, but is there no middle ground at all?  <br />The idea of the Indian American culture being superior to that of the almighty Puritans is used as an example, which could be built upon in several interesting ways, but instead the author chooses to illustrate how everything that came after was just silliness without supplying a single idea about how it could be done better...yet useful. <br /> <br />At one point he actually uses the example of (paraphrasing here) turning on the T.V. news to hear \\"`Thirty thousand people were killed today when five jumbo airliners collided over downtown Lose Angeles\\" *click* Stop worrying about everything and go about life. Listen to the birds chirp, they will tell you more about the world.\\" ---wait, we shouldn't care about thirty thousand humans being killed in a horrific accident?  <br /> <br />I am in no way an expert on Taoism, but unless everyone who IS finds that idea posing as a representation of their philosophy to be offensive, I want nothing to do with it. It isn't enlightened to go around hating everything while doing nothing. And I'm sure the author realizes this since he spends so much time writing best=selling books. <br />
B00UHZMGBY|4|I enjoy Muse and was very excited for this CD to some out. It did take some time to grow on me but I'm liking it more and more.
B00A6PD9I4|5|I loved this move. Without trying to give to much away it's about a girl trying to be her own person in a kingdom that demands she does exactly what she is supposed to.<br /><br />I love all of the characters, and think that this was an extremely well written and animated movie.<br /><br />I watched it 3 times within 24 hours :)
B005MLOKXA|5|WELL WRITTEN.
B000LXH0AE|4|Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent who leads an extremely boring life, discovers that he is the main character in a novel written by Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), an author with a reputation for killing off the protagonists of all of her novels.    \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" starts as a gimmick film, the gimmick being that the main character is a character in a novel, but unlike other gimmick films, where the gimmick frequently wears thin after the first half hour or so, writer Zach Helm has the good sense to evolve his movie into what is actually a pretty sweet romantic comedy.     Will Ferrell, best known for appearing in comedies aimed at teenagers, delivers an unusually restrained performance and as a result, gives one of the best performances of his career. Harold Crick is a character whom you just can't help but liking, and that is because he is such a human character. Crick is essentially just an ordinary guy who is in love with a girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and wants to live a long, happy life with her. The fact that the obstacles that Crick must face in order to achieve this goal are so incredibly far-fetched doesn't change the fact that he is experiencing feelings that we can all understand and relate to.     Whenever I dislike a movie, I find myself hoping that the main character will die. By contrast, with \\"Stranger than Fiction\\", I genuinely found myself hoping that Crick would live. It is for this reason, I strongly recommend this film.
B005XQLBU4|4|Decent game.
B000008HPE|5|I'll be honest, while I do love a lot of Huey's work, I just bought this specific CD because of my favorite movie \\"American Psycho\\"  Money well spent!

B000HF0IIC|1|Christopher Nolan assumes the audience is intelligent.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher assumes the audience is dumb. This is why Batman Forever is offensive.

B0038JN6VA|3|I really like the sound of this small speaker. The &#34;off and on button&#34; stopped functioning after a few months though. The only way it would work was when I plugged it into my computer via usb.
B009EEL94Y|5|I am a cartoon fanatic so I like most of those in the Disney genre. This one is cute and entertaining and I love the celebrity voices. Though I claim to buy them for my grandchildren they are really for me.
B008RYN44U|5|OK folks, we're not going to get a 1995 version of what No Doubt should be today. Music has evolved as has technology and the times we are in.  I have listened to this album a few times and I have to say it's impressive. Settle down is Great as is Looking Hot, as is One More Summer, and the reggae beats of Push and Shove.  Track 10's Heaven is my personal favourite of the album and I think it would work well as a single.<br /><br />I think the track Easy is better than One More Summer given that Easy has really subtle guitar elements that work really well.  Tracks 6 - 9 are a little slower and there's nothing wrong with that. If I were to have a critique it's that I don't like tracks 9 and 11 very much but it's not to say they are not listenable and these tracks do work with the album as a whole.<br /><br />I think if people would listen to this album with an OPEN MIND, they would appreciate all the elements of this album, just listen to to how well the bass and drums are working together.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I think the band did a great job and Gwen sounds amazing and I personally think she is the best female vocalist of our generation. I would be quite disappointed if they sounded the same as they did in 1995 with this new offering. I admire bands that evovlve as musicians.<br /><br />You have to give No dobut Credit for they have been together 26 years now and that's a considerably long time given that band's today only make it as far as 1 or 2 albums before they start popping out greatest hits to fulfil contractual obligations.<br /><br />No Doubt, if you do read this review, please put Auckland, NZ a spot to tour as my wife & I would love to see you guys play live.
0316666343|4|This book was more than a little unnerving; the narrator occupies her own role as a semi-omniscient teenage girl watching from heaven as her family copes with her disappearance, while also occupying the role of each of her family members and her killer. While the book carries a powerful message of the healing qualities of family, it also juxtaposes the more sinister aspects of dysfunctional families and coldly comments on society's movement toward fractured communities and the decline of the neighborhood lifestyle. Can get heavy-handed with the imagery, but has good characters and an interesting storyline.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I purchased 3 of these and it makes so much sense to use this to access Netflix, etc. on your TV.  Great Price too.
0140120416|5|I am brazilian, and i though it could be very hard to learn a language which nothing in common to portuguese such as russian (save few similarities) , even more hard learning by an book in english.<br />For surprise, i find a book easy to read, learn and practice exercicies in russian.<br />I stronglly recomend this book to everyone who wants to learn russian, and if you're not an american/britanic but knows english, it is a good way to practice your english WHILE you learn russian! Perfect!!!
B006OAB3ME|2|Been a Beatles, and thus McCartney fan since the '60s. Enjoyed his post-split \\"solo\\" albums, still listen to and enjoy Ram.<br /><br />I'm happy for Paul if he enjoyed putting this together, and I'm sure some will love it.<br /><br />For me this is just not an enjoyable listening experience; doesn't bring anything to the table as a cover album must to be relevant.<br /><br />I get why he would want to record these standards; I grew up listening to them, too, and value their place.<br /><br />Comparisons to Linda Ronstadt's and Harry Nilsson's similar recordings will show how a sweet voice can carry it off.<br /><br />Sir Paul's latest effort brings to mind, instead, Randy Newman's \\"I'm Dead (But I Don't Know It).\\"<br /><br />Too bad.
B00GKKTZZU|5|Loved it can't wait for more books to come out.  This is a must read!  You will enjoy all of the Immortals After Dark.
B000XUBFE2|5|I really enjoyed this book!  Well written and I found it hard to put it down!  I would recommend it to everyone!
1577311523|5|This book is one of the most practical, enlightening and insightful books I've ever read.  If you keep a log of your minds activities during the course of the day, will you discover that a good bit of that time is spent reflecting on the past, or anticipating the future.  Yet, as Eckhart Tolle points out, the now, this very instant in time, is all that is.  Life is the \\"now\\", the needle tracking along a grove in the record of life.  It's the looking back and ahead the generates a lot of negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, etc.  If we can concentrate all our energies into now, how much more fulfilling life would be.  Do you see your mind as a tool to be used to your advantage, or do you give it free reign to dart about the time continuum constructing an ego image that dictates who you think you are?  Can you control your mind?  This book will help you discover who you really are, put you in touch with that person, and from that point on, your life will never be the same.  It's a truely remarkable book.  Everything you read will ring true to you simply because it makes so much sense.  So much sense, you'll end up wondering why you never thought of it yourself.
B004GHNIRK|3|I'm only 25% through a 700 page book, enjoying the period language; some sections discussing the politics and authors/philosophers of the day were not relevant to me, and the relating of the battle of Waterloo only slightly more interesting, but otherwise the story and culture of the time are fascinating.
B00JZK0QNM|4|Brilliant graphics and plays really well, no gliches as yet. It's a simple idea, build up your army and defeat the enemy but it's,also strategic, reminds me of kingdom rush and is as good. Recommend this game hundred per cent
B0060ZJ7BC|5|Brad is so good in this
0061245097|5|This second book in the series gives us a more mature Cat Crawfield working for a special unit of the government that kills human-murdering vampires. Cat is the commander of her specialized team and is operating under a secret identity and hasn't seen Bones in four years.<br /><br />Cat is so much more likable in this story. She's matured because of the choices she made to protect Bones and her mother and commands a team. She's more thoughtful in her decision making but still the fearless woman we love.<br /><br />I loved this story, which has Cat reconnecting with Bones and continuing her search for her father. We still have the exciting scenes with Cat in action and the romance with Bones is off the charts (beware of Chapter 32). The tension between her and her team because of her relationship adds additional spice. The story is well-written with a seamless flow from one chapter to the next. I hated to see it end so I'm on to the next in the series.<br /><br />This is a must read!
B00005YU1O|2|Ugh. I hate this movie more than any film I have ever seen in my life, and frankly, this film deserves it. The whole concept of this movie is one dopey looking guy wandering around and waking up from his dream, while not really waking. That's not so bad. The horrible part is a bunch of 15 year olds just finished reading Philosophy for Dummies and a few other new age books, and they want to share their horribly flawed views of the universe with horrendous leaps in logic. Oh, and they're armed with a thesaurus. It's a pretentious \\"Who can use the biggest words\\" game throughout, and it impresses no one. Add in a few adjectives that serve no purpose, and the result is four guys walking down the street when one shouts \\"Society is choking on its own vehnile existence in a swarm of complacency\\" and one replies \\"We are dancing exuberance in the light of eternity!\\" I think this may be an attempt to hide the fact that what they are actually talking about is very simple, and often, very silly. One man takes 10 minutes of droning on to say that leaps in human advancement are happening in shorter and shorter amounts of time, which is a decent observation, then out of nowhere he says evolution and survival of an organism will depend on truth, justice, morality, and sincerity. There are a few good speeches in there, one at the very end and a few in between, but it's hard to take any of them seriously when they describe free will and the nature of the self with healthy doses of \\"like, y'know\\" every other line. The only pros this movie has is the great visual style, and that it facilitates conversation (although most of the conversation will be \\"WHAT THE? I HATE THIS MOVIE!\\"). Don't buy this. Rent it once, laugh, cry, shout, have a real discussion about the topics without the bs involved, and go on with your waking life.

0743455967|4|&quot;On Writing&quot; is only the second Stephen King book I've read. The first, &quot;Danse Macabre,&quot; was also non-fiction. I'm no literary snob, but there are a lot of books out there to read and only so many hours in the day, and I've chosen not to read fiction about people who blow things up with their eyeballs or possess other powers not likely to be encountered in real life. I'm sure King's phenomenally popular output has more going for it than that, but it has limited appeal for me. Still, I'm always curious to know what other ink-stained wretches have to say about the craft, so I had to read &quot;On Writing.&quot;<br />You'd have to be very curious indeed about King's methods to wade through his &quot;memoir of the craft.&quot; Early on, he describes &quot;On Writing&quot; as a way to record all he knows about writing &quot;briefly and simply.&quot; He does keep it simple, avoiding the pretentious language one often encounters from &quot;writers&quot; who want to impress readers with their vocabulary. Brief is another matter. He quotes William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White's &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot; claiming he'll follow their advice to &quot;Omit needless words,&quot; but he makes that promise in the &quot;Second Foreword&quot; where he also suggests this is a &quot;short book.&quot;<br />A short book? With a &quot;Second Foreword&quot;? Those looking for guidelines to more effective writing are better off with Strunk and White whose short volume has never been improved on. With King, one is dragged along as he recounts his beginnings, relationship with his mother, and, later, the accident that nearly took his life. It's certainly interesting, but try finding the advice for writers in there. He does offer valuable suggestions, but if all you're seeking is tips to improve your own writing, you can find better guides than this one. If you're interested in King's life story, however, dig in. On that level, it's a good read.
B000002UCN|5|I love this but where, on CD, can I find &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Moon&quot;...is it released anywhere?  Shouldn't they be on a Greatest Hits CD?
B006LSZECO|4|This book was a decent read but not my favorite. It is interesting and somewhat suspenseful. I liked it. However, I can tell this is a new writer of books or it seemed that way. I don't know if I will read anymore books by this author but I might.
B0025KVLV0|5|I've been listening to the Beatles since I was old enough to know what music was. My older sister was, and is, a huge Beatles fan and bought every album and single that was released here in the U.S.. I can remember as a small child, my sister and I getting ready for school listening to the Beatles blasting on our RCA TV console record player. The stereo my mother had won on the TV game show Let's Make A Deal. The school day mornings were ours, our parents were off at work already, so we were free to escape into the world the Beatles had created. Later on when my sister had her own record player, don't tell her, when she was away I would sneak into her room and listen on headphones to her prized collection. I became very intimate with all of the songs the fab four shared with me. Their music so inspired me that I became a singer, songwriter, producer etc.. Thank God for the Beatles' music. Cut to 1987 when with great anticipation the Beatles finally released their music on CD after many years of legal wrangling. As has been stated before, they didn't live up to the sonics I had remembered. Gone were the clicks and pops, but so was the magic and excitement I so cherished. They sounded very flat, mushy and overly compressed. It was still the same songs but as heard through a filter. Now in this glorious age of technology and even more compressed volume wars of the digital era, they have been finally res erected. Everyone, including me, who cared about the great legacy that is the Beatles were skeptical. Would the powers that be try and please the masses that are used to overly hyped, compressed, CDs and MP3s? Or would they treat them as the musical historical documents that they are? Well worry no more! The rematsered Beatles albums are a revelation!<br />I can honestly say I am very impressed. To my ears, these sound much better than I have ever heard these songs. As I have read from others, I have heard things in these recordings that I have never heard before after intently listening to these songs ever since their original release. The clarity is startling in it's honesty. Most musicians would be horrified to hear their vocals and playing with such a microscope after being used to having things so meshed together by the past mediums' masters. These aren't your ordinary musicians as the world knows. It is jarring at first to hear these recordings that we have loved for so long. They sound like the same songs but so clear that they sound different. The first thing you notice is that you can now hear the bass and drums with much more clarity and authority. Next I noticed the vocals of such amazing resolution that you can really hear their spit and snarl. I can go on, but you are wasting time reading my ramblings. Go out and get your favorite album and have a listen. Or just find some money and buy all of them, if you are a Beatles fan you will be glad you did. Simply,no,majestically a masterpiece body of work.ently listening to these songs ever since their original release. The clarity is startling in it's honesty.

B00DDTQE1Y|1|This app has poor instructions and I cannot understand how it works.  The &amp;#34;tutorial&amp;#34; is worthless.  Maybe it's not good on Android phones?? Frustrating. Glad I could try it for free.
B00CQZ65SI|5|The book is brilliant.  I cam across it while looking for a gluten free dairy free cookbook.  I know nothing about tennis.  I have been gluten free for over 3 years and dairy free going on one.  I was still having issues with horrible mood swings and what the author terms Sugar Hangovers.  I agree they physically hurt.  i also had a really bad case of the skin disease that goes along with Celiac Disease.  This book over a one week period has improved every aspect of my life.<br /><br />It is a brillant book because it looks at food a little bit differently than any other book I've read.
B002PEP4SC|4|Gets moving quick and keeps on going. A few suspects but near the end you know \\" who did it \\". Would recommend to anyone who likes police stories.
B001UV4XUG|5|This is one of the favorites in our house. Light, funny, quirky, with a good soundtrack. What's not to like? Better than most romantic comedies and with a bit better vocabulary as well. I recommend this to everyone I meet.

B00005JO5L|5|The year is 1980.  The scene is New York's infamous gay S&M clubs.  The theme is murder.<br /><br />Al Pacino is cast as an undercover cop out to get the  bad guy who is murdering homosexual men who participate in this bondage and dominance world.  This is a world and a lifestyle that flourished before AIDs, and many of the scenes were filmed in the actual clubs such as the Ramrod, the Anvil, the Mine Shaft and the Eagle's Nest that catered to the tastes of this subculture at the time.  It was filmed in New York's Greenwich Village and the infamous meat packing district and waterfront which has since been converted into a beautiful waterside park and upscale apartment living areas.  But then was then and this is now.<br /><br />The film is raw with tension throughout as the serial killer brutally murders his victims.  When Al Pacino comes into the picture we experience it all through his eyes.  He's actually straight and we see him in various scenes with his girlfriend, played by Karen Allen.  Naturally he can't tell her about his assignment which creates tension between them.  But there is tension throughout the film in other ways too.  Men are attracted to Pacino and he must play his part of being gay.  The murderer keeps killing victims.  Paul Sorvino, cast as the detective who encourages Pacino to keep going is understanding.  But he pushes Pacino hard.  There's pressure to solve the crimes.  And there's conflict in Pacino's mind about this lifestyle.<br /><br />How it all turns out is predictable but not before there are many false leads and a depiction of how the cops intimidate and abuse possible perpetrators.<br /><br />This is a good film and Pacino once again proves his acting ability.  And it is fine history about a time and a place and a lifestyle that has indeed changed through the years.
B009UX2YAC|5|I love this game I wish it stays a game for ever. If u guys delete it ill die that's how awesome it is.
B001ET0826|5|Prince was in the development stage of a project based on Homer's Odyssey - Glam Slam Ulysses - that morphed into a plan to simultaneously release a commercially-orientated album (that became The Gold Experience) and one more musically experimental, which is this album.<br /><br />Warner Bros. balked at Prince's vision and released the album in August 1994, with the 10 tracks clocking in at 48:43. Recorded between 1991-1994, the album reached #15 on the Billboard album chart with minimal promotion from Prince, who was engaged in a very public dispute with the record label. The single, Letitgo - which charted on four Billboard lists, the best being #10 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs - has lyrics concerning the professional turmoil. Another single, Space, had minimal success, peaking at #71 on the same Billboard chart.<br /><br />This is not Prince simply pushing back at Warner Bros.; it is a collection of material from an artist whose aim was to take his fans in a revolutionary new direction. It is a vastly underrated album from a period of incredible output for this iconic figure in pop music.
B00KMXQIYM|5|This show was better than expected. Considering it doesn't focus on costumed heroes, the episodes were pretty exciting.  The cast may have started out a little bland, but the actors made us live the characters. The show was full of twists and sported plenty of Marvel geek in-jokes. Well worth the money.
B00IRH7AKG|5|I chose because all the acting was so good. Hoffman was believable as Capote. At times the movie was slow, but that's probably because our attention spans are so short now!<br />Good movie
B008YRVW0I|4|This game is great to play while watching or should I say listening to tv. Good for multi taskers. Just started playing little over an hour not bored yet.
B00IXF8PLU|3|Despite all of the good reviews of this movie, I personally found it quite boring.  I couldn't even finish watching this movie.  My $4.99 rental had drained down the river.
B001C4CI8A|5|Excellent movie, both DiCaprio and Crowe played outstanding..
B006AZZPCM|4|Until I upgraded now the ads take over an crash the player! Lots of my subscriptions don't show up or won't play!! I would gladly pay for this app if they get the bugs worked out!!
B008AIGWVA|5|its funny
B00GIZO674|5|Fantastic port to Android.  I have bought the game from Big Fish on Mac and PC before, and this versions is just as fun!<br /><br />Simple game mechanics that keep getting more challenging keeps me hooked.  My partner looks over my shoulder and says, 'I don't get it.  You're just making burgers...'  BUT it's so much more.<br /><br />Warning, you will get hungry.
B00B4FU6KE|5|This book took me completely by surprise--it is engrossing and witty and honest and strange. I can think of little to say that won't spoil the experience and will simply recommend this book, unequivocally, to every reader.
B0060D3BWK|5|GREAT movie from my childhood. It's so hard to find it anywhere else so I was very happy. Thanks Amazon!
B00GIGGS6A|1|I've read tons of reviews from established artists about how this tablet is amazing. How it has excellent pressure sensitivity and a huge active area to play around in. And for 75 bucks, I was willing to take the pepsi challenge and find out for myself.<br /><br />I didn't get the chance.<br /><br />The drivers from the manufacturer's website did not work with windows 7, nor did the drivers from the CD included with the hardware. I spent hours trying various configurations, even going so far as installing Windows XP SP3 on a separate partition with no internet connection whatsoever to see if I could get a proper response. I was disappointed again and again.<br /><br />Tried to contact the company by email, received no response. Tried to contact them through Deviantart via their product page comments section ( where oddly they were providing the same copy and paste response to all problems) and received no reply. From what I'm told, dealing with them directly is a bit of a nightmare, to the point where they request videos of the malfunction and photos as well.<br /><br />I have absolutely no confidence in their support structure as the PC environment develops and changes the drivers more, and god forbid something breaks as a manufacturing fault.<br /><br />I wish I had the chance to experience how great this tablet supposedly is, but I'm afraid this entire experience has burned my opinion of the manufacturer and this tablet line in particular. A problem which will extend to the monoprice version, which is essentially the same hardware just labelled differently.
B007L3BMGA|1|I read this book after hearing all the hype about it..... I was SO not impressed.  The storyline is nothing new....boy meets girl, one of them has an issue (in this case her inexperience and his predilections) they get together and break up over issue, and ultimately get back together.....sound like every romance book you have read in the last 10 years?  The only difference is that his issue is s&m.....which seems to be why everyone raves over this book........<br /><br />Sorry, but I was seriously underwhelmed when I read the trilogy (yes I read all three to confirm my opinion).  This is a mediocre romance novel at best...the twist  being the \\"kinky stuff\\" which was uncomfortable to read in many situations....  I am certainly not old or prudish, but  spanking for the pain.....doesn't do it for me....if you take away the kinky bits, this is a very boring romance novel...<br /><br />I am a wide and voracious reader, but I really think a book that glamorizes beating up women, no matter what they say , is abhorrent.  I don't have a problem with handcuffs or other \\"bits and pieces\\" for fun but  this book goes further than that, in that it is saying that's it's acceptable to beat up women when they don't do what you want, it is saying its ok to punish women who speak up.....I am truly appalled that this has made the bestsellers list, and that Hollywood stars are lining up to play the characters in a movie....<br /><br />To me this is a bad mills and boon story with kinky undertones, and unfortunately it's the kinky undertones that sell it....<br />If you have any respect for women, don't buy this book, as it will just keep it up there on the bestsellers list
B005LAIIMG|4|Enjoyed the movie a lot. Great effects.
B000MXPE7O|3|but several plot twists drop like bombshells in this movie.  Matt Damon's character seems like a closed box.  Felt like I never got to see his true character.  He is so darn reserved and somber -- even when a couple of the surprises hit.  I actually stopped the movie as the character development didn't hold my interest.  Glad I went back because the second half of the movie was worth it!<br /><br />The director took a lot of leeway with the history of the CIA, from what I've read.  It doesn't hurt the movie but historians might complain.<br /><br />Camera work and scenery are great.  The sets were authentic and made me feel like I was looking back in time.  The 1960s buses, taxicabs, clothing -- it added to the movie.  The 1960s era glasses were an especially nice touch.  The makeup used to age Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon was impressive.  They actually appeared to age throughout the movie.<br /><br />Was annoyed by the jumping back and forth in the movie.  Felt there was more than necessary.  First we are in 1961, then 1920s, then 30s, then 60s, then 40s -- the constant changing annoyed me.<br /><br />Still can't believe how stone-faced Matt Damon's character was.  Even when some of the bombshells hit, he kept his cool and didn't show any emotion.  Would hate to play poker against him.
B001DDBCUA|5|Love this movie! This was a great movie from the series. It had everyone involved. All 4 of them had something going on that they had to deal with which is nice from the series when it usually focused on one of the girls. But what a great chick flick about how your girls will always be there and you should forgive at some point.
B0063IH60K|5|This game is fun to play. There are no glitches in the app and it doesn't freeze up..just lots of play time and options to customize your game. Ads are easily  closed out of and they don't interrupt your game. This is one of my favorites.
0790729970|5|Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was really the movie that put Jim Carrey on the map. The Mask is the movie that solidified his position as the funniest guy in Hollywood.<br />In The Mask Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss the nice guy who always finishes last. He gets a hold of a mask that once he wears it his innermost desires come to life. Will Stanley let the mask rule his life or will he realize he's great just the way he is. You'll just have to watch the movie to find out.<br />Jim Carrey gave an awesome performance in this movie. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a musical or comedy. He didn't win it, but his performance was definetly good enough to have one it. Ipkiss is in no way Ace Ventura. He isn't the confident wild man that Ace is. He's the nice guy that finishes last that everyone likes. Carrey plays it to perfection. Once the Mask is put on Carrey becomes that wild man that we love so much and thats where the movie really excels. The animation they used for Ipkiss with the mask on is great and Carrey plays the wild man better than anyone ever. He sings, dances, and throws out some of the best one liners ever. Stanley Ipkiss is a great character and thanks to Jim Carrey for making him that.<br />Cameron Diaz is great in the film. This was the movie that introduced us to the formere model. She holds her own real well in the movie. Carrey was so hot when he did this movie riding the success of Pet Detective and she shines in this role. She is absolutely gorgeous throughout the whole film. She's not a bad actress and I really wish she'd do more roles like this.<br />The extras on the DVD are decent. There are some deleted scenes that are alright and the directors commentary is decent as well. The movie can be viewed in full or widescreen format and it features dolby digital sound. I wish they'd done some more with the special features though. They could have done something cool with the music or special effects, but they didn't.<br />The music isgreat in this film. I have the soundtrack as well and the music helps make this film great. Jim Carrey is great when he dances and sings in &quot;Cuban Pete.&quot; There are some great swing songs like Royal Crown Revues &quot;Hey Pachuco played in the movie. This really could be considered a musical in many ways.<br />This is a fantastic film. It's fun the whole familiy can relate to and is a must own. The DVD is pretty easy to find cheap, so don't miss out on this fun film.
0425276767|4|good book  new with know problems
B009NQKXYK|4|I watched this movie expecting it to be the prequel to Alien, it' kind of is but not necessarily. It's good on it's own but it ties in the Alien universe.
B000H6SXMY|5|The best price that I could find on this COMPLETE FRIENDS SERIES anywhere. <br />My 19 year old daughter only requested this for her Christmans gift as she's a super fan.  It comes packaged in a classy box,that includes a book with quick synopsis of each episode. Audio commentary is another feature. The synopsis also lets you know which episodes that had a guest star.  Money well spent for the ultimate Friends fan!
B00EHMFC78|5|The one thing that you have to ask while reading this book is, &#34;Do they ever sleep?&#34;  There are numerous sub-plots woven into the main plot which makes this book impossible to put down.  I kept saying to myself, &#34;Just one more chapter.  I have to see if they ...&#34;.  Before I knew it, the book was finished.<br /><br />Grab this one and give it a read.  Baldacci seldom disappoints and this is one of his best.
B003WUYRGI|3|How did you thought about this. A boy or girl thought about this. I loved your book. My name is aren
B00C8S9W0G|4|Very good continuation of an excellent series.
B009GXHOW4|5|Awesomeness!
B003TSEL7S|5|This book is amazing in so many ways. It teaches u all about both Greek Gods and Roman Gods which i think is awesome. I chose to give it a 5 star rating because I couldn't take my eyes away, it was such an amazing page turner that I would just stay up till all hours just to finish it. I recommend this book to people my age, in there teens, because if u need things about Greek mythology, without all the boring stories and lectures, then this is the book to read.
B0001HAISG|2|I don't remember loving the Disney version of Peter Pan that much, but I have a gorgeous illustrated book sitting at home, which I've had since I was a kid (and continues the story of Peter coming back as Wendy grows up), and I love Hook! I thought this would be the same, but it wasn't. Boo. I couldn't be bothered watching it after an hour, so I gave up.<br /><br />I don't know what it was about this movie, but mainly for me, it was really boring. And it was a lot darker than I remember the kid's story too. I didn't like Jason Isaacs, who played Hook, but then I did grow up with the utterly camp Dustin Hoffman playing Hook in Hook. :) (And something I didn't know, following tradition in both theatre and film, the actor portraying Captain Hook is the same actor portraying Mr. Darling, in this case, it's Jason Isaacs. I thought they looked familiar!) Also the kids played on my nerves a bit. Not so much the actors playing Wendy & Peter, but John & Michael. And Smee just wasn't the same as Bob Hoskins playing him.<br /><br />It's quite weird as well, there's a lot more of a relationship between Wendy & Peter than I've seen before - shall we soon be seeing an adult version?! I'm not sure what it was, but there was a lot of talk at the start of the movie, where they talk about Wendy having a \\"kiss\\" at the corner of her mouth - what was all that about?! And it sounded like they were talking of marrying her off when she was barely 13! I thought this was made in the early 1900s, not the medieval days! (And don't even get me started on the dog as a nanny - I didn't get that as a kid, and I don't get it as an adult.)<br /><br />Jason Sumpter was OK playing Peter, he's totally your stereotypical picture of Peter, but there was something always quite right. You could see how much he grew up during the film - he went from 5 feet tall to 5' 8\\" during filming. The window of the nursery had to be rebuilt 4 times because he kept hitting his head on it.<br /><br />The thing I loved about the book (and the wee bit in Hook) was Peter coming back and seeing Wendy growing up. Apparently, there was an alternate ending was shot where Peter meets the adult Wendy and her little daughter Jane. I don't know why this part of the story always appealed to me. (And seeing the Lost Boys grow up too - I loved that!)<br /><br />A cool little bit of trivia for you - the preview trailers for this film used music from the video game, \\"Myst III: Exile\\", but the music was never used in the film itself.<br /><br />The film was noticeably cut, and at one point badly, as I noticed it! (And that's saying something.) I have the region 2 version of the movie, and before I switched it off, Peter & Hook are fighting (in the cave I think), and it looks like Hook is about to headbutt, when we suddenly, and very abruptly cut to the little rowing boat. This was cut in order to secure a PG rating. I also think we lose the bit where John & Michael are hanging upside down, and on some versions you see them from behind, with their nightshirts over their heads.<br /><br />I found one similarity between this & Labyrinth, particularly since in the children's bedroom, there is a lot of pirate, mermaid etc stuff, very similar to the scenes in Labyrinth.<br /><br />The extras on this look pretty cool, and are split into different sections, some categorised under the different places that appear in this. The extras include: 11 featurettes; Visit the Darling House: Alternate Ending. What happens when Wendy is all grown up! Hilarious Deleted Scenes. In the dog house with Mr. Darling; Board the Pirate Ship: Through the Eyes of Captain Hook - Jason Isaacs' behind-the-scenes Home Video Footage! The Lost Pirate Song - The Swashbucklers sing a deleted tune; Explore the Neverland Forest: Tinkerbell - Behind the Fairy Dust. I Do Believe in Fairies - Inside the magical world of the fairies; Enter the Black Castle: Learning to Fly - Go on set to the \\"Flying School\\" training camp. Mermaids' Tale - Behind-the-scenes with these mysterious mermaids; Dig into the Home under the Ground: The Legacy of Pan - Duchess Sarah Ferguson gives an insider's look at how the story of Peter Pan came to be!<br /><br />I haven't seen another bad review about this movie, so I feel slightly disappointed to be giving it a two-star review. I'm going to keep the DVD though, as the extras look really good, and I might be persuaded to give it another try at some point. Now bring on the adult version!maids' Tale - Behind-the-scenes with these mysterious mermaids; Dig into the Home under the Ground: The Legacy of Pan - Duchess Sarah Ferguson gives an insider's look at how the story of Peter Pan came to be!  <br /> <br />I haven't seen another bad review about this movie, so I feel slightly disappointed to be giving it a two-star review.

B00992CF6W|3|I love minecraft so I was super excited about the update. It was totally cool, for about two days. Then my kindle fire started crashing. CONSTANTLY. I was willing to push through though, I just turned it back on and kept playing because it was worth it. Then one day, it wouldn't turn back on. It was probably my mistake, I pushed it too far so I want to warn other players. If your device has a few bugs (I got my kindle fire used so I knew before hand it wasn't perfect), the update turns them into big bugs. My kindle had all my school books on it because I'm a homeschool missionary and now it's all lost. You have been warned. The update is awesome but sometimes it comes with a price higher than seven dollars.

B005SAP45I|5|\\"violence\\" ?? eh?  cars crash, and what?  There is LESS violence in this 90 min movie than in a 10 minute \\"tom & jerry\\" or most tv cartoons today.<br />OK, there is a lot of explosions and such, but still; it is cars blowing up, not humanlike characters smashing each other with frying pans.<br />Great family fun, minimal violence, no cursing (unless you count \\"day-gum\\"),<br />Hilarious, action packed, great computer graphics.<br /><br />And as so eloquently described in other reviews, this is a \\"James Bond\\" adventure. With all of the action, but swap humor for gratis flesh and cursing.<br />There IS a message interwoven here, the 007 turns out to be Mater. Could it be something like \\"dont judge a book by its cover\\"? or maybe \\"be the best you that you can be\\" ?<br /><br />Rent it, if you don't like it, forget it. just that simple.<br />If you really like it, as so many do, purchase the DVD.<br /><br />NOTE: that on Amazon there is usually a trailer to watch to get a feel for what it is going to be, so there is no need to be \\"surprised\\" by the content.<br />which brings up a very important point:  as a parent You are Responsible for Pre-screening  movies and TV for your children.<br />You are responsible to select appropriate shows for your children, Not the writers or producers of the movie.<br />You are personally responsible to know the content of the show Before you let your child watch it.

0743554434|5|Recounting the restrictions and frequent culture sanctioned brutality<br />for the women of Afghanistan, this story kept me praying for these<br />fictional characters - praying that there could be a splendid sunlit<br />dawn for them. The situation pulls on the heartstrings and pushes<br />compassion to its outer limits as the story unfolds. I could not stop<br />listening. I had to know how it would end. And I will pray daily now<br />for the women of the Middle East who are still trapped in this kind<br />of dehumanizing cultural morass. It is well written. The characters<br />will continue to live in my heart and imagination. I am glad to have<br />persevered through the details that were indeed, too hard to hear<br />at times - incredulous that real women continue to struggle and<br />survive the same sort of restrictions and culturally sanctioned<br />brutality.

B00000BKDW|4|powerslave is a great album and of course should purhcased by anyone who favours heavy metal a la maiden. however it seems that the album is missing something, a key element to the songs isnt there. in this review i will attempt to tell you what and where i believe important elements are missing. 1) aces high- great pounding opening track great rythm, lead and rythm guitars and of course bruce is singing well 2) 2 minutes to midnite-same as aces high a classic 3) lofser words- creative if not repetitive instrumental worth listening to  4) flash of the blade- fantastic opening, verse and chorus riffs youll be singing along to this one. However, there is no guitar solo, just a nice little melodic bit. my complaint with this is the rythm guitar and drum during this bit(Nicko sounds like hes banging on pots and pans and whoever is doing ryhtm guitar decided to make it really dull) 5) the duellists- this song doesnt sound at all like iron maiden teh main verse, while being nice and melodic, just doesnt have a maiden feel to it. the solo in this song is overly long and makes you want to put your head in your hands. The lead bit is ok( nothing special)  but it would have been much enhanced had there been a good, tight rythm section( which it doesnt) 6) back in the village- worth skipping 7) powerslave- magnificent song, its better live though because it doesnt have that stupid background chanting during the chorus 8) rime of the ancient mariner- great song, the part in the middle gets a bit boring, but the part after that rocks boys and girls, there arent many moments in rock history that are more powerful than right after bruce sings &quot;down comes the rain!&quot;<br />so laddies to sum it up this album is definetely worth buying. However, in my opinion,it doesnt have the  bone chilling, headbanging maiden feel that makes them so great.For the most part the rythm section is almost catatonic(except in songs like 2 mins, aces, powerslave, and mariner) some of the songs lack the energy and speed of other songs from other albums(number of the beast, piece of mind, iron maiden, killers, somewhere in time, 7th son of a 7th son, no prayer for the dying, brave new world)<br />Up the Irons!

B00DR0PDNE|3|I like it because it's cheap and easy to connect and set up.<br />But Especially here in Italy the number of app available is very limited (no netflix which is one of the main ones)<br />Hopefully they will add more soon to take more advantages of this simple but cool device.<br />Great the idea to stream a Tab from Chrome broweser to your TV, they should add the same feature for the mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

0716748789|4|I recently got a copy of this text from the publisher (for review purposes).  So I took a look and then read some of the reviews here.  Let me just say that \\"Angry Inorganic Student\\" is way off base.  I've taught out of both Huyeey, Keiter & Keiter and Douglas, McDaniel & Alexander.  Both are ok and this one is no worse.  In fact I think it has a nice fresh look that updates the materials in the \\"old standard\\" textbooks.  I found the sections on solid-state materials, nanomaterials and bioinorganic timely and appropriate.  I may even consider switching to this textbook when I teach senior inorganic in the spring term.
B00JB3MVCW|1|Can I give less than one star please?  Movie takes God out of the story.  God is some distant being than apparently Noah thinks is only interested in saving animals not mankind.  Noah is poorly portrayed as is God. What a horrible redition of the story.

0780626966|5|Better than Halloween and the Friday the 13th series, there has always been something about the Nightmare on Elm Street Collection that has made it so much better than the aforementioned slasher flicks.  Maybe it's because that the first film came from the ingeniously macabre mind of Wes Craven and he crafted a cinematic villain that was truly scary instead of just someone walking around with a big knife and a mask.  Or maybe it's because that same villain had more menacing personality and voice than your Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers or Leatherface.  In any case, even though it had it's ups and downs, this really is an essential collection for horror fans.  We all know the first film is an absolute classic, written and directed by Wes Craven and featuring the debut of a young Johnny Depp, and it introduced us to razor clawed dream killer Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund) and his reign of terror upon the children of Elm Street.  The second film, Freddy's Revenge, was a major step down but featured some great gore effects.  The third film, Dream Warriors, which was directed by Chuck Russell and scripted by Craven and Frank Darabont, featured a young Patricia Arquette as well as Laurence Fishburne, while the fourth film, the Dream Master (directed by Die Hard 2 and Exorcist: The Beginning director Renny Harlin) lets down on the story but the sets and effects enough are worth the price of admission alone.  The Dream Child, directed by Stephen Hopkins (Predator 2, Lost in Space) is stylish but shallow, while the following film Freddy's Dead is beyond bad.  The last film, New Nightmare, which featured the return of creator Wes Craven, is ingeniously creative and ends the series with the bang it deserves.  It's true that the Nightmare on Elm Street series has had a sordid history, but as I said before, it is an absolute must have for any and every horror fan.

To wit:  how do you enforce intellectual property rights across borders in today’s global economy?<br /><br />The editor of this important book reminds us that ‘intellectual property is nowadays rarely limited in scope to a single country’ – which indeed makes the intellectual property system international -- and with the advent of the Internet, borderless.<br /><br />This book from Edward Elgar Publishing examines a range of cross-border IP enforcement issue via the 18 learned articles it contains, from as many expert international contributors. Collectively they look at the various means of cross border enforcement (or lack of it) and the variety of issues that arise from the often diverse policies on IP enforcement that prevail in different countries and jurisdictions – and it is interesting if you read this book, to compare the similarities and differences.<br /><br />The 18 essays are grouped in four parts. Part I examines a range of national and regional systems individually.  Editor Paul Torremans -- a Professor of Intellectual Property Law at the University of Nottingham -- observes that some jurisdictions formulate and enforce special rules for cross-border cases. In developing economies, though, the emphasis tends to be on forming and implementing an IP enforcement system in the jurisdiction itself.<br /><br />Part II deals with traditional private law areas such as jurisdiction… choice of law… and recognition and enforcement.  Part III looks at cross-border enforcement from the point of view not only of practitioners, but of arbitrators and judges.<br /><br />Part IV, on ‘special issues’ will be of special interest to practitioners and others, including the creators of intellectual property themselves. Especially relevant here are the chapters on IP and the Internet.  ‘Challenges for the enforcement of copyright in the online world,’ reads one, and the other: ‘Time for a new approach.’<br /><br />Although obviously of direct interest to IP lawyers, you don’t necessarily have to be an IP specialist to find the book directly relevant to your practice and your general knowledge of the law. Take for example the interesting observation in the book’s first chapter on enforcement of IP rights under US law.<br /><br />The statement is made that US courts are more willing than ever ‘to contemplate extraterritorial application of U.S. intellectual property and to incorporate the realities of the global marketplace’.<br /><br />Despite what the writer, Marshall Leaffer calls ‘the decline of territoriality’ there is apparently a reluctance in the US ‘to incorporate decisions of foreign courts into domestic legal culture.’  On this side of the Atlantic, both pro and anti- Europeans might make much of that.<br /><br />As you might infer, the book offers practitioners much to contemplate on this very contemporary issue, which certainly impacts on a wide range of individual and corporate clients.<br />If you are an IP practitioner, you need this book in your library.<br /><br />The publication date is cited as at 2014.issues’ will be of special interest to practitioners and others, including the creators of intellectual property themselves.

B003KRJNBW|4|good movie
B007IXWL2C|5|Loved it, I hated I had came to the end of tne book, and will be awaiting her next book. Exciting, adventurous,  thrilling, a real rollercoaster ride in words.  Super good story, well done to the author.
B000F8O35U|1|Nvr recieved my movie horrible
B00L9B7IKE|3|Great idea to use the train ride and the fantasy of who lived in the houses she passes each day. But then the story is about abuse. Alcohol, verbal, physical, emotional, manipulation and lies. The story pulls you in but I don't think I smiled once during the reading of this story. The plot is twisted in oh so many ways.
B006TVQU6C|1|The  Antec High Current Gamer HCG-900, 80 PLUS BRONZE, 900 Watt Power Supply  is to long to fit the Antec computer case.  almost 1/2 of the fan on the power supply is covered by the metal on the bottom, and the 120 mm sytem fan, can not be used, because the power supply is covering the bolt holes on one side where the fan goes....<br /><br />Everything else was ok, but this problem has killed using this case.  I am looking for a better case.
B004L86718|4|Love this movie because of the interactions btwn Cruise & Gooding Jr. The story lines that included Renee Zellwenger were just okay and imho the weak link to the film and a distraction. This movie could have been superb even without the love interest. A story about believing in yourself and taking a leap of faith. Doing what you feel you're called to do, with integrity, even when the chips are down. I've watched it countless times and the relationship between Cruise & Gooding is always an upper.
B00004Z459|5|This album rocks. Every song is great. Here are the songs and my ratings.<br />Papercut- 10, Hard and it has an awesome bridge.<br />One Step Closer- 10, The best on the CD. Great chorus.<br />With You- 8, Good, but it is to soft for Linkin Park.<br />Points of Authority- 10, This song has an awesome chorus.<br />Crawling- 9.5, A very good, softer song.<br />Runaway- 10, I love the chorus, and it also has good meaning.<br />By Myself- 9, A very hard song, but a little too much yelling.<br />In The End- 9.5, Another yery good soft song. I love Mike's rapping.<br />A Place For My Head- 9, The bridge is the best part of the song.<br />Forgotten- 9,I  like the mix of a soft verse and a hard chorus.<br />Cure For The Itch- 7.5, A good DJ mix, but I don't realy like them.<br />Pushing Me Away- 9, A good ending to a great CD.<br />All in all, this CD is awesome. Get the CD and pick a favorite.<BR>My personal favorite is One Step Closer. It is hard, awesome, and the bridge is totally sweet!Also, there is absolutly no profanity, so everyone can listen to it. I hope this helped.Linkin Park rocks!
B0000A98ZP|5|This is one of those movies that takes you back to the 80's (which is great if you grew up in the 80's). All the different \\"cliques\\" coming together, during detention, to realize how despite their differences, they are a lot alike.
B004DLPXAO|5|It's so convenient to get the books I want to read straight to my phone! Even though I would LOVE to have a Kindle, it's the next best thing!
B00CKOYVG8|3|This app is sort of interesting. Gives you a few levels each week that you try to get the best score you can, and then you compete against your friends (Facebook connected) to see who can get the highest cumulative score. Unfortunately this is only fun if you have any Facebook friends that play.
B001XUPD94|5|Star Trek is always good. Prime should really work to stream a new Star Trek series that'd be so awesome.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Not bad,seems entertaining so far
B002BSHWUU|1|It is extremely disappointing that the greatest band ever can't even get their music released in the best format possible.  Being a musician and engineer, I understand what few people do - that the Beatles recordings are handicapped by the multitrack limitations of their day.  And, I understand the desire of many fans to hear the mixes remain the same as the originals.  But, compression, noise reduction, etc. are not the best solutions.  And, seriously, why would anyone go from analog tape to ProTools when attempting to keep the best sound?  Its a nasty sounding PCM technology.  They then reduce the quality more by putting it on CDs.    Maybe no one would have realized how good the Beatles recordings could sound, except they released the \\"Love\\" mix on DVD-A.  That just blows these mixes away.  And, if the Rolling Stones catalog deserved the effort to put it out on SACD, why not the Beatles?      Can someone please do the work necessary to release the Beatles correctly in a modern high resolution audio format for those of us who want to hear their recordings sound their best?    Few will hear the differences made in this new remastering if the band ever decides to allow Apple to compress their music for online sale (or for anyone burning this to their iPod), so why bother with anything other than something great for the rest of us who still prefer high resolution physical media for music?    Please, will someone release the Beatles on SACD?

B009UX2YAC|5|Hands down best game I've ever played changing but very fun. You should try it. I love the cop he looks funny
B00AFEY354|5|You have to watch it if you haven't already. Be forewarned; keep a box of tissues handy!
0374533555|5|Brilliant insights shown as thought experiments of human behavior. I use his well researched findings every day and have sent copies of his book to my children.
B002HJ9PTO|5|Mic picks up sound well, and the quality of sound is great. I don't know much about professional grade equipment but this was more than great for semi-pro interviews, recordings etc. Also a fan of the on/off switch
B00004XONN|1|Radiohead have gone too far here. They have released an album that is 10 songs and 49 minutes of complete noise. I agree with the 109 1-star reviews that this album has so far, and I'm about to make it 110. This album was a complete waste.<br />I can't bear to talk long about such a bad album. &quot;OK Computer&quot; was one of the best albums ever. If they had just stopped there at that cross between genuine rock music and computer experimentation...but no, they had to take it one step farther. On this CD, they almost completely ditched guitars. &quot;Kid A&quot; seems an appropriate title, as any Kid A could have ran around the studio for 49 minutes pushing notes on various synthesizers.<br />Overall, this album is a sincere disappointment. I recommend you buy it only as use for a drink coaster or if you are seriously considering committing suicide. Other than that, you will regret this purchase.
B002KGKH5A|5|Filmed and recorded in 2007, this might be the last great gasp of a rock band most people will never see live. It is a very charming journey through the provinces of Canada, bringing the White Stripes music to large and small places alike. You can see the joy in the audience's faces. Above all, the music is pure genius. God knows if they'll ever go on the road again. Who knows if rock and roll will ever produce something this good again.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is awesome
B0009RCPY8|5|awesome thank you!!
B000LTAY1U|4|nice watch... it is flat so it doesn't stand out on your arm.  It is kinetic  so you need to wear it a lot so it don't stop
B00DFFHUUA|3|Not too shabby
B00DQ845EA|5|Ben's anecdotes are really valuable - not only for a CEO, but for any founder/entrepreneur, or leader in a growing business. It doesn't focus on management style or tools, but (as the cover says) the &#34;Hard Things&#34;: Helping to find the balance between transparency and having to continuously reset expectations, having to decide that your head of [Marketing, Sales, Product, HR, etc.] - who may have done a great job getting your company from A to B is NOT the right person to get it from B to C, having to make company-saving decisions that are not a win-win for everyone. Great job
B0015AARJI|5|bueno
B0042TV4IW|5|The perfect fit for my Downton Abbey withdrawals -- I missed this series when it was originally on air, but had a lot of fun watching it.  It's a shame that the 4th season only had 6 episodes!
B00IEBE7GK|5|Great puzzle app. As enjoyable as original
B007J4T2G8|5|Was hesitant at first to review this book but I'm going for it anyway. I found this book to be very entertaining. It puts in words experiences that I will admit to having thought about. It borders on pornography but yet tastefully written.  I am happily reading the second book and have already bought the third. What the heck, go for it, enjoy and people will wonder what you are thinking when they see you blush while reading it.
1569242739|5|I have tried many many vegan (and other) recipes for cupcakes...and by far this book has the best selections.  The recipes turn out some of the yummiest cupcakes ever!!!! The frostings are great, the ingredients go from being everyday and ordinary to very unusual...but it all works!!   Try this book..GO VEGAN...better for your health, the environment..and the ANIMALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5|I wish I could wax rhapsodic enough to do justice to the brilliance of this show.  I saw Serenity first, then bought Firefly, The Series and was immediately transported into a wonderful, rich, hilarious, tense, moving 'verse.  This show is visually stunning, the writing is superb and the characters of depth and style, anything but stereotypical and flat.  I recommend this show to absolutely everyone.
B00M7URUUE|1|This is the worst Movie or Story about Noah and the flood ever told in the history of story telling.  It's completely unbiblical.  God did not destroy the earth because mankind was destroying the environment or eating meat.  God brought His wrath and judgment down on earth because of our sins against God, such as Adultery, Fornication, Lying, Stealing, Idolatry, Blasphemy, Murder, Coveting, and dishonoring our parents.  God is the only one who can tell us what sin is, and He told us that in the Bible.  This movie is heresy.
B0042U94UQ|5|Can't wait til second one comes out!!!! My entire family absolutely loves this movie. Has adult humor that kids don't get so parents aren't bored watching kids movies!
1101898402|5|I don't typically buy guides because I feel like you can just find the information online for free if you need it. However, because I tend to travel quite a bit I like to have a guide in front of my instead of wasting my data. I am impressed with the quality and how fast the delivery was (long story short I got the guide before the game) and I like that it comes with the e-version free. It is a well made guide and I will purchase guides from this company again if the future if I choose to.
B008JFUTT0|4|Quite good. Expected more. Left me unmoved but my daughter enjoyed it. Personal preference. Read the synopsis and decide for yourself whether it sounds like something you would enjoy.
B005LAIGN2|3|George Lucas has overseen the creation and American phenomenon's of six \\"Star Wars\\" movies and four \\"Indiana Jones\\" movies, including producing many other smash hit movies, and with his latest Lucas studios release, he says that he's done everything he ever dreamed of doing. That latest release is a biopic about a crew of Negro pilots in the Tuskegee training program, otherwise known as the Red Tails. Not unlike the things that the Tuskegee airmen had to face, on top of facing Nazi's during World War 2, George Lucas faced much alienation with this project from studio executives across Hollywood. Despite his credentials and his long time devotion to the project, Lucas couldn't get a `yes' from a single one of them.<br /><br />Well, \\"Red Tails\\" may just be one of Lucas' best movies in years, although that isn't saying much. The Tuskegee airmen were delegated to, as one airmen stated in the film, \\"shooting traffic\\"; trains and trucks. Not only were they wrongfully characterized as unintelligent and not brave enough, but they also were facing a public relations machine in a military that didn't want negro airmen getting credit for battles in the newspapers. Thus, they were given unimportant missions.<br /><br />\\"Red Tails\\" is a good return for George Lucas, but also for Cuba Gooding Jr., who won an Oscar for \\"Jerry Maguire\\" and then went into B-movie oblivion. Terrence Howard has been on a similar road since \\"Ray\\" and \\"Hustle and Flow\\", although he's bounced back and forth with an occasional hit.  The real stars of the movie are Nate Parker, who plays Captain Marty \\"Easy\\" Julian and David Oyelowo who plays Joe \\"Lightning\\" Little. The two of them are best friends and give character and soul to a film and a story that needed a face.<br /><br />George Lucas is no stranger to filming and creating aerial battles. We've seen them dozens of times in his Star Wars movies and his expertise shows in this movie, they are just a little closer to earth. The battle scenes in \\"Red Tails\\" are real and engaging. Although some of the dialogue is really stiff and was a direct contrast to the realism of the battle scenes.<br />The biggest problem with \\"Red Tails\\" has nothing to do with the characters, the story that needs to be told and the battles that were fought and ignored, but the fact that the movie could have told so much more of a story and didn't. Truth be told, the story of the Tuskegee airmen is history that we didn't learn. It is a story that needs to be seen and heard by everyone, but the movie doesn't give it justice. The movie plays like a footnote only to inform us of their existence, but never gets beyond the surface to inform us of anything more.<br /><br />\\"Red Tails\\" could have been so much more, but I still recommend the film, just for the sheer sake that this is a story that isn't taught in our schools and should be.hough some of the dialogue is really stiff and was a direct contrast to the realism of the battle scenes.

B000HC2LIK|5|Yes this movie entertain me.
B0007XCMQA|5|This CD literally lights up my speakers and/or headphones when I play it. The Rawness of the U2 War Album & the Clarity of the Original Master Recording make this a must own CD.
B000P0J0AG|5|One of my all time favorite movies!
B00EMXBDMA|5|Excellent read. Grabs you from 1st line and doesn't stop.
B009K0P10K|5|Accidently &#34; Missed&#34; the last episode.... and THANK YOU Amazon, for having it so fast.....This is truly a &#34; Tangled Web&#34; and so close to the truth... the average person, just does  NOT realize... Money is NOT all it is cracked up to be
B000005IU2|5|There is just no getting around it. This may be one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time, if not THE greatest. This is pure electricity. Pure hardcore raw muscle flesh and blood pumped up stoned out ripped open smashed in drunk wasted rattle your blood get your flesh vibrating rock. This is pure punk rock. <br /> <br />Consider this album was made in 1969. Think about that! 1969!1969!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just think about it!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! It blows my mind!!!!! What the heck was everyone else doing in 1969???? Wearing flowered bell bottoms and cranberry V-neck kimonos and listening to the Beatles!!! Well, I overstate, but still! <br /> <br /> This may be one of the most ahead of its time albums EVER. I don't know if I've ever heard punk rock that can compare to this. If you listen to it at full blast a few times I swear it's like being punched in the face and injected with adrenaline.  <br /> <br />All the songs on this are amazing. Full-throttle. One thing I'd like to point out is a lot of people seem to be saying \\"Dirt\\" isn't quite up to par with the rest of the album because it's a little slower and murkier. I disagree. Dirt is amazing. It blows away Jesus Lizard, the Cows, and Swans with one fell swoop. This is true punk sludge the way it should be played.  <br /> <br />(I love Jesus Lizard and Swans too, though)
B009ZZDNT6|3|Don't fret on the price and get the P R O. It is worth it and an app you will use for years to come...
B000LPQ6DE|4|Except for a couple of minor quibbles, I loved this version. Like another reviewer mentioned, I thought it dwelt far too little on Lowood.  Some of the more passionate scenes I thought were a little over the top (such as when Rochester is caressing Jane on the bed), but on the whole it really was terrific.  Beautiful cinematography.  Ruth Wilson was quite good as Jane, and I actually thought Toby Stephens was a very convincing Rochester (in my mind he was the most magnetic Rochester cast).  I was glad to see this version devote time to the Rivers family after Jane leaves Thornfield, in fact I enjoyed the second part of the series more than the first part.  It far outshone the horrendous William Hurt version and the 1940s version (in which Joan Fontaine was horribly miscast).  I'm adding it to my DVD collection!
B00B2JSRAS|5|Pam Grout hit a home run with this work...simple to understand, extremely well written, and great techniques that work.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to read it again.  She turns the great unknown from a mystery to a friend, which is no easy task.  I highly recommend it.  She helps you realize the universe is on your side, which I found very comfortable.
B00000DC4A|5|Adams has written with Lange for about 8 years and has cranked out pop hits (4 albums to date I think)- albeit some were thanks to pop movies.  Now on his own, he is back to orginal Adams talent. This album has style  and quality.  It evokes originallity and modern diversity while maintaining  a pop rock centre piece. - Adams just gets better with age.
1591396190|3|This book was for school, can't say that i hated it or loved it. it was a necessary purchase. Sorry
B00O3RQI1G|5|This has always been one of my favorite albums.  I love the bonus material, several songs I have never heard and some excellent extended versions.
B0002S94OS|5|well, first off i would like to say that i am a huge metal fan.  well, music in general, but metal is by far my favorite.  my favorite metal is probably 80's metal for sure.  but i do like some fear factory, some korn, some deftones, and i would have to say that lamb of god is possibly the most intense metal band to ever come out of the western hemisphere.  if you like the rhythms and overall intensity of scandinavian black metal, but dont really like all the dungeons and dragons/fantasy/macabre lyrics and majestic vocals, then you would really like this album.  this has some of the coolest and most intricate riffs ive ever heard, and some pretty sick lead work on it too.  a lot more so than the last album.  overall, this is one of the best metal albums ive ever heard.  lamb of god has slowly become one of my favorite bands since i got this album.
B00DJFIMW6|4|Good to kill some time and have a somewhat challenging game once you get to a certain point in the game. overall good
B007I1Q4W2|5|A++++
B00BVYNSLC|5|Found this while browsing and loved the show. Well written and just enough plot twists and discoveries. We cannot wait until season 2 begins!!
B00EGJ32A6|2|This review is for the entire series, as I read, and cautiously enjoyed, the first two books, in great part with anticipation for revelations and a conclusion(s) in the final novel. Unfortunately, that never occurs. Characterizations are, at best, impersonal, and the writing sporadically clear, then muddled. The intent of the author seems to be to describe humanity's encounter with another culture so alien that we can't communicate with it or understand its intent/purpose, and while that prospect is intellectually plausible, given the myriad ways in which life could evolve in another time/place, the lack of meaningful interaction between the characters and whatever that Other is, deprives the story of interest and prevents it from coming to any comprehensible conclusion. Of all the questions that are posed or develop over the course of the three books few, if any, are answered coherently. The concepts are not without merit, and much promise is hinted at but, ultimately, the series fails to deliver.
B000JMKQX0|5|couldn't put it down!
B000PWQPAC|5|This was a great movie.  If you Like Ghost in the Shell I would recommend this movie. Ordered it right from Amazon and it came in a few days.
B003Y5H574|5|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I'd buy it a million times. I laugh, cry, and fall in love all over again.
B00LP9EE1G|5|I couldn't wait for this to come to Alaska after reading the graphic novel. The plot is completely different but that was actually an improvement for me who doesn't want to waste time on romance when I'm watching for how humans deal with adversity.  It exceeded my expectations and surprised me. I am biased because I used to work on a train but I love the metaphor. It was refreshing not to have to see people fighting crazy monsters but fighting their own humanity in order to survive then fighting their survival instincts in order to become human.  Tilda Swinton was marvelously funny, what a clown. All of the actors had integrity. I did not cry when anyone died, I was not moved by any gestures, but I felt a bit detached. Maybe that's just me, or maybe that's what the director had in mind.  I will watch again when it comes to theatres here but that may be a long cold wait!
B00DR0PDNE|5|What an amazing product, I don't have a single TV in my home without a Chromecast.
1451626657|4|This is definitely *not* the easiest book I've ever read. I found it to be very emotionally demanding. It is, all at once, bizarre, chaotic, raw and dark. Dark humor permeates the greater portion of the novel, more often than not with characters getting tied up in bureaucratic nonsense often resulting in life-threatening outcomes. The book's namesake, Catch-22, is perhaps the greatest of all bureaucratic nonsense -- it is a perfectly logical group of words that is illogical in practice, and can be easily manipulated to fit any given situation.<br /><br />What starts out as fairly comical -- a man somehow making a profit by buying eggs for five cents and selling them for seven cents, for example -- little by little becomes a grotesque illustration of the life of a soldier in wartime. Our hero, Yossarian, gradually falls apart as his friends are killed off one by one and obsesses over all of the ways he too can be killed. When Yossarian finally decides he will never fly on another mission, thus stirring up trouble among the other enlisted men, he is offered a choice: be sent home safely and betray the other men, or face a court martial.<br /><br />Through each scene in this novel, the reader is forced to analyze the atrocities of war. One scene in particular stands out -- a 107 year old Italian man tells Yossarian that winning the war is pointless, and that by losing the war, Italians will outlive both the Americans and Germans that keep invading their country. As long as the Americans and Germans fight each other, it doesn't matter to him who wins, since they weren't fighting Italians.<br /><br />This book is emotionally draining perhaps because the United States has been at war with someone since I was in 10th grade, and I can scarcely remember a time when we weren't at war. It made me take a long look at what goes on behind the veil.
B002OEBMN4|1|WOW, Slaughter hasn't put a good record out since \\"Wild Life\\". Why can't they put out classics like \\"Up all Night\\" anymore. Don't waste your money.
B00DRPVE3M|4|Generations have enjoyed UNO.  Now kids can enjoy it without losing some of the cards needed and without a friend being physically present.  It's still more fun to have friends in the room, but if you are stuck in a waiting room or a carpool line, this app is good to have.
B00005JLSE|1|This picture is obnoxious and unbearable to watch on the screen.  Show tunes do not translate well to the screen if you're dealing with subpar actors who are not veteran Theater performers.  Watching \\"Singin' In The Rain\\" or any old musical where people are actually singing and dancing with such talent and prestige, no cut-away shots to mask the fact that there is no way in heck the leads could do what they're trying to manipulate, is what I miss.  Gere and Zeta-Jones and Zelleweger couldn't sing or dance to save their lives, but thanks to modern technology we can edit a movie so much to make this bombastic mess, which helps them appear to know how to perform in a play-sorry, no thanks.  The fact that this picture somehow stole the Best Picture from Lord of the Rings (a true masterpiece) is beyond me and makes the Oscars a joke in my opinion.  I couldn't stand this hyper-anxious-cynical take on our world and I don't know why others can.  Remember, that's just my two cents.
B00785P2QC|5|I love playing this game it very addictive even my kids play it
B002AS9OZW|5|Their music is for anyone and uplifting for anyone who need a lift in their spirits.  I have purchased discs for my sister and a friend who had been looking for their track 'Home' but had forgotten the groups name.  She was very thankful that, on a whim I brought her home.
B0025KVLU6|5|Especially if you are a Beatle fan, you may want this album.  It is unique in that it was recorded at  a time when the Beatles were sort of &#34;on their own.&#34; The literature accompanying this album was also very interesting.
B009UX2YAC|5|I like it so much I can't wait for the new version  I wish it was out but I know it isn't
B009ZQ8FQG|5|There is nothing &#34;not&#34; to like about this historical drama set in such a pivotal point in history. Story lines are great and the acting remarkable. Shirley MacLaine was at her best!
B009YP9L7U|5|much to my surprise, this book is actually quite interesting. I recommend this book to people who enjoyed the movie \\"What Happens in Vegas\\"!
B00005ATQH|1|Hi,<BR>I have a copy of Lolita released by WarnerVideo. Its running time goes for only 147 minutes - the original goes for 152 minutes. Why has this movie of 1962 been cut in this way.<BR>How can I obtain a version of this movie that runs for the whole time.<br />thanks.
B00N6PD3GE|4|A very good book.  I highly recommend it but have one criticism.  Why no photographs?  No picture of the ship, the captain, etc.  Certainly these must be available in some archives.
B004ECDNJU|1|Game play is dull and on the second stage one of the orbs glitched and skipped a pipe and got stuck bouncing forever.
B00B7FOQCK|5|good!!
0679745653|5|The name Holi Golightly stands as a paramount in the XX Century culture. As a character, she define fashion, charm and desired, and she has lived in our imagination since when the movie was released. But before the movie there was the book. Written by Truman Capote, `Breakfast at Tiffany's' is one of the best novellas ever written in English. The charm, the style, the passion, all is there.<br />This is more or less the book that defines the glamorous New Your in our mind. The city is virtually a character, as important as Holi's cat, so to speak. Its urbarn landscape is pictured in our minds as a happy place, where one can help but having fun whenever one wants. At least this is what we get from the protagonist's behaviour.<br />Capote's style is full of charm and passion, and the length of the story makes it precise and almost flawless.  Maybe we wouldn't have succeded had he written a long novel about Holi. Things and people pops up in her life and a few pages later they are gone and forgotten. Lucy are the ones who had the luch to meet her.<br />The other three stories in this book are quite good not, although not as nearly as famous as `Breakfast'. `House of Flowers' tells a story about love and how much we sometimes give up in order to be with the one we like. It is a story of a girl who is trying to find her place in the world, but all she finds is not so many good people. Those people are not bad, they just aren't good. `Diamond guitar' is about two convicts who become friends and how important this friendship is for them in order to survive the difficulties of jair. But, of course, something will came up and may --or may not-- set them appart. The last story `A Christmas Memory' is a little jew that should be saved for Christmas time. It is about the unexpected friendship about an old woman and a seven-year-old boy.<br />To sum up, the four stories in this edition deal with misfits, that are trying to survive in a wild society that does not accept too much poetry and sweetness. This book is a high achievment for world wide literature. And later, with `Breakfast at Tiffany's' an achievment for the cinema.poetry and sweetness. This book is a high achievment for world wide literature. And later, with `Breakfast at Tiffany's' an achievment for the cinema.
B002MQYOFW|4|Enjoyable. I am a spanish speaker and bought this book for practicing my english. The reading was easy and enjoyable.
B00Q4EJVRO|5|Great price, great album.
B006YC74E8|5|My title say's it all. I have MS and with it comes severe cognitive difficulties and Photo Editor is not only easy to use but does everything perfectly! My pictures look great and now I can share them with no flaws.
B007XKEY6Q|4|Its fun and i love it.  But sometimes it freezes my kindle fire hd. And  i had to delete this app and re-download it multiple times.

B009CVRQLY|5|&#34;She is AWESOME in concert!  LOVE HER PASSION and her HUGE RANGE!&#34; I have to admit.  I never like her.  In fact, I made fun of her and her &#34;ATTI-TUDE&#34; when she spoke, performed, all of the above. Then we saw her in concert in Las Vegas in 2007. SHE IS AWESOME and all that too!  She deserves to be known as one of the greatest singers in the world!

B00PTB7B34|2|I lost all the saved game due to recent updates. Damn, I have to start all over again or may find another game.
B000S1M9LY|4|Not your usual light fare, but highly absorbing. I find that I have to tackle it 30 to 50 pages at a time; then, rest. I'm  enjoying the journey.
B00DPM90C4|5|As covert, secret government agency, deep-cover-missions-against-middle- eastern-terrorists thrillers go,this one was a fast paced, exciting tale. The unravelling of a sinister and frighteningly brilliant plot to devastate the United States keeps you reading and rooting for the good guys. Lots of tense moments and near misses.  If you like Harlan Cobin, Lee Child, or Vince Flynn, you'll probably enjoy I am Pilgrim. A great binge read.
0694003611|5|Classic book.  Perfect gift for my friends first baby.  I like that it is the thick pages; it should hold up for years of reading!

B00B4804KS|5|Great to see this film again, and the 3D conversion was flawless.
B009DCOU9S|5|Challenging without being overwhelming. Pace was good. If I got stuck, there were enough hint opportunities to enable me to solve the problem. It was like starting a good book; I had a hard time putting it down - I wanted to just keep going to the end, and I'm not a regular game player! I will look for more such games from Neosoft.
B00005JKQZ|5|Maximum enjoyment of the first viewing of this film requires NOT KNOWING previously something which I won't divulge here.... although wise and experienced movie critics such as Roger Ebert went ahead and &quot;spilled the beans&quot; in their reviews.<br />That being said, this film is a modified account of the life of Nobel winner John Nash, and I can think of no film that does a better job of &quot;getting inside the head&quot; of one of the world's great thinkers in a way that a regular joe like me (and presumably, YOU) can understand.  It's also a fine love story, and though John Nash wins the Nobel prize, Alicia Nash easily takes the noble one.<br />The DVD comes with many extras with the two highlights being separate commentary tracks from director Ron Howard and writer Akiva Goldsman.  The film, in a remarkably time-efficient fashion, ably demonstrates that genius is not only frequently tortured, but that it consists of epiphanal moments of inspiration interspersed with hours of hard labor to &quot;flesh out&quot; the inspiration.<br />Bravo John Nash, Alicia Nash, Ron Howard (directed), Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Christopher Plummer (principal cast), Brian Grazer(produced), James Horner (composed a wonderfully appropriate score).<br />See the best picture of 2001.
1609611543|5|A very informative book, I would recommend it to everyone.  I have loaned the book to my friends, may have to order another one for myself.  This book has helped me lose weight and feel better, I can attest it is true.

B0051ANPZQ|5|I purchased this book for my grandson but read it first to determine whether it was age appropriate for him, yet, as he is youinger than the age span,recommended... although he is an avid reader.<br /><br />I loved the topic and how the author wove the tale with looking at the issue from diferent perspectives. It ws also a special story for me because I taught diasability awareness and respect to students in the same age category as the students in this book. It was an 18 year career of joy for me, as my students were incredibly receptive to people with all disabilities, as evidenced by the class visits as part of the program following experiential activities!<br /><br />Hence.. I loved Wonder, In fact, my niece also sent my grandson, Wonder with a note that he will want to discuss it with his grandma (me!)
B00BESM14U|5|Hands down the best book I ever read (Harry Potter Series my all time fav). Everyone should read this! I am a 19 year old college student and can relate to everything mentioned in this book. Such an amazing story that everyone needs to read. Will read this many more times! One time is not enough. I am a Wallflower!
B000JMKQX0|4|I really enjoyed this. It was a different yet enjoyable format. The stories are quite varied and interesting. My only real complaint is that toward the middle some of the stories are very long, which is generally fine, but toward the end some of them are incredibly short. Why would this interviewer travel across the globe to interview somebody and get just a minute or two of an interview? The vast majority of stories are of about perfect length.
B00004XONN|1|I really don't have a lot to say. It's a major disappointment...After Pablo Honey, The Bends, ect...This album is so horrible...hardly any lyrics...it sounds like Enya on acid, but without the harmony! Buy this album if you want to waste money...I swear...this is so horrible...How could they go so wrong? Please...Somebody...help this band out before they're on the street!

B005544TRQ|5|I honestly bought all the seasons I could and watch the upcoming shows via Hulu because it is just tooooo good. If you like witty, sarcastic shows, this is a must and the story line is great. Romance, drama, and a good amount of punchlines.
B00471TLZS|5|We had a great movie night with this one! A classic.

0316174483|5|I loved this book . I wanted something my 5 yr old grandson and I could use to decorate a kids wooden picnic table. This was perfect. He picked animals he liked and each family member picks an animal to add to the table. Just painted our fingers and made the prints. Easy and fun!
B00000J7J4|5|Baby Boomers, check it out! Santana is kickin' it. I've read a few negative reviews and I realize that everyone has his/her own preferences. However, I don't know what the man could do to make this a better album.  The intricacies of his playing give me chills! It's HOT!
0486278077|4|The book was a little slow to start, but soon, the characters become quite enticing. It is a nice, short read, so at least it is not a daunting epic of a novel. Even if it were, I wouldn't mind if it were a bit longer, just because I liked it so much. I would certainly check out Wilde if he had other novels, but, alas, he does not.<br /><br />Some may view it as boring or dull, so if you like action packed books, you probably would not put this on your &#34;must have&#34; list.
B003P2WO5E|5|Sanderson's first in a 10 book series is incredible. This book is HUGE, and it's full of a new world that I can't even begin to understand now he imagined it. The characters are amazing (Kaladin and Seth are my favorites), the action, as always, is superbly written - Sanderson is a master at action sequences, and the story captivates you. I read this huge book in a week, I just couldn't put it down. Waiting (impatiently) for the next one in the series, this book leaves you on a huge cliffhanger!
0393072231|5|In order to offset the \\"REVIEWS\\" that Amazon allows I give this unread book by Mr. Lewis five stars. If Amazon allows bogus 1 star reviews, here's one for a great writer. I own the new Kindle but I am not associating with the disgusting behavior of the Kindle community.  AMAZON YOUR RATING SYSTEM IS LOSING CREDIBILITY!
B0053KWDES|5|This item is a must have for anyone like me that thinks their headphones could use a little more volume or a cleaner sound.  I would recommend this amp for anyone in that situation.

0440242576|3|John Grisham has made a comfortable living writing legal thrillers for the past couple of decades. Over the years I have read most of his books and, for my money, you can't beat page-turners like The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Runaway Jury for quality leisurely reading.  I was surprised then, a few years back, when I saw that he had deviated from his normal writing regimen to author a novel about a suburban couple who decided to \\"skip Christmas\\" and all of its accompanying hustle and bustle for one year. It sounded boring, pedestrian and very un-Grisham. I passed it over and didn't think about it again for several years.<br /><br />It so happened that my sister owned the book, however, and strongly recommended it to me last month. I was doubtful that it was worth my time but she sold me when she said I could probably finish it in one or two sittings. I was looking for something light and fun and Skipping Christmas sounded like it might just be the answer.<br /><br />Thankfully, I listened to my sister and gave the novelette my time. The story centers on Luther and Nora Crank who live in an affluent suburb of Chicago. The narrative begins as their only daughter, Blair, joins the Peace Corps and leaves for her first mission to South America. The Kranks are understandably disappointed she won't be home for the holidays and lament that it won't be the same without her. As Christmas approaches they face the usual distractions and annoyances of the season (i.e. long lines, crowded malls, busy traffic, sending Christmas cards to relatives you never talk to, solicitors representing a million different charities and causes, etc.).<br /><br />Grisham does a fine job of relating these all-too-true seasonal events with humor and grace.  He does an amazing of recreating a busy mall scene in all of its over-crowded, gaudy commercialism splendor.<br /><br />Fed up with the fake \\"spirit\\" of the season and forced generosity, the Kranks inexplicably decide to \\"skip Christmas\\" and opt, instead, for a discounted Caribbean cruise that departs on Christmas day. The storyline follows the Kranks as they deliberately skip and neglect Christmas parties, Christmas decorating, gift-buying, and other holiday contraptions. In their place are visits to tanning salons, strict dieting, and unintended social consequences.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />Just two days before Christmas the Kranks receive an unexpected phone call from their daughter Blair, who announces she is engaged and returning home for Christmas with her Brazilian fianc&eacute;. She tells her parents she can't wait to show him a Christmas back home in the States. Hilarity ensues as the Kranks scramble to cancel their cruise and prepare for Christmas in one day. In the end Luther and Nora are reminded why they do enjoy and love Christmas despite the hectic schedules, commercialism, and busyness of the season.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert Over!<br /><br />Memorable Excerpt:<br /><br />\\"Well!!\\" he said dramatically, shoving his plate forward. \\"Now that you mention it. There's something I want to discuss with you.\\"<br /><br />\\"Finish your pasta.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm finished,\\" he announced, jumping to his feet. His briefcase was just a few steps away, and he attacked it.<br /><br />\\"Luther, what are you doing?\\"<br /><br />\\"Hang on.\\"<br /><br />He stood across the table from her, papers in both hands. \\"Here's my idea,\\" he said proudly. \\"And it's brilliant.\\"<br /><br />\\"Why am I nervous?\\"<br /><br />He unfolded a spreadsheet, and began pointing. \\"Here, my dear, is what we did last Christmas. Six thousand, one hundred dollars we spent on Christmas. Six thousand, one hundred dollars.\\"<br /><br />\\"I heard you the first time.\\"<br /><br />\\"And precious little to show for it. The vast majority of it down the drain. Wasted. And that, of course, does not include my time, your time, the traffic, stress, worry, bickering, ill-will, sleep loss - all the wonderful things that we pour into the holiday season.\\"<br /><br />\\"Where is this going?\\"<br /><br />\\"Thanks for asking.\\" Luther dropped the spreadsheets and, quick as a magician, presented the Island Princess to his wife. Brochures covered the table.  \\"Where is this going, my dear? It's going to the Caribbean. Ten days of total luxury on the Island Princess, the fanciest cruise ship in the world. The Bahamas, Jamaica, Grand Cayman, oops, wait a minute.\\"<br /><br />Luther dashed into the den, hit the Play button, waited for the first notes, adjusted the volume, then dashed back to the kitchen where Nora was inspecting a brochure.<br /><br />\\"What's that?\\" she asked.<br /><br />\\"Reggae, the stuff they listen to down there. Anyway, where was I?\\"<br /><br />\\"You were island hopping.\\"<br /><br />\\"Right, we'll snorkel on Grand Cayman, windsurf in Jamaica, lie on the beaches. Ten days, Nora, ten fabulous days.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'll have to lose some weight.\\"<br /><br />\\"We'll both go on a diet. Whatta you say?\\"<br /><br />\\"What's the catch?\\"<br /><br />\\"The catch is simple. We don't do Christmas. We save the money, and spend it on ourselves for once. Not a dime on food we won't eat or clothes we won't wear or gifts no one needs. Not one red cent. It's a boycott, Nora, a complete boycott of Christmas.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sounds awful.\\"<br /><br />\\"No, it's wonderful. And it's just for one year. Let's take a break. Blair's not here. She'll be back next year and we can jump back into the Christmas chaos, if that's what you want. Come on, Nora, please. We skip Christmas, save the money, and go splash in the Caribbean for ten days.\\"<br /><br />\\"How much will it cost?\\"<br /><br />\\"Three thousand bucks.\\"<br /><br />\\"So we save money?\\"<br /><br />\\"Absolutely.\\"<br /><br />\\"When do we leave?\\"<br /><br />\\"High noon, Christmas day.\\"<br /><br />They stared at each other for a long time.<br /><br />Conclusion: This book does not come with a strong recommendation to read or not read. It is simply a light, fun seasonal story. If that's what you're looking for this holiday season, I urge you to check this book out. If not, simply pass on it. There are mild religious overtones throughout the story as the Kranks insist to neighbors and friends from church that they're still going to celebrate Christ's birth; that they're merely passing on the commercial and secular aspects of the holiday. That being said, this is a decidedly secular book with a feel good ending. And sometimes there's nothing wrong with that.the Island Princess to his wife.

B001GKJ2FM|5|I absolutely LOVED this movie -- I had never seen the musical...actually, I'm not a big fan of musicals as a rule (except for film version of \\"Grease\\")...so I was pleasantly surprised to find myself smiling and dancing in my seat throughout the entire film. Talk about a feel-good movie! I wanted to be a member of the cast dancing alongside Meryl -- oh  and Meryl, what a VOICE! Is there anything this woman can't do?! I have long admired her as an exceptional actress, but her choice to do this film raises my admiration even more, because it shows she knows how to have fun! And that's how I would sum up this movie: FUN! I wouldn't necessarily recommend this film to someone who doesn't like ABBA, but even if you only like a few of their songs you might be surprised to find yourself bopping along to ALL of the music!
B00BKBCM4A|5|CD shipped quickly and came in great condition. Great selection of songs. I am very happy with my purchase.
B006ATJXQW|5|Amazing!
B00H9671YQ|5|Great movie in the midst of a lot of garbage that is considered &#34;entertainment&#34; today. Buy this movie and you will not be displeased.
B00D2K40WY|1|My daughter was so disappointed because you have to buy the full version to pretty much do anything in the app (and also be ad-free).  I'm uninstalling it!
B001KWTBVQ|5|Delightful movie in every way.  The whole family can enjoy this excellent movie.  It has humor and excitement and suburb acting.
0439023491|5|A good follow up to the intense new life of Katnyss Everdeen. Even though I personally prefer the first book, this one leaves nothing out as it explains the conspiracy in a corrupt and dangerous government. Never got boring and always kept me guessing what was going to happen next. Highly recommended.
B006GWO5NE|5|You get everything you need to keep your kindle up and running  while you are reading or watching a movie.
B009C7ZQM4|5|OMG THIS IS THE BEST CLEANING APP ON EARTH! It has cleaned an outstanding 4.69 GB.THATS A LOT! I would definitely recommend getting this app. It's free and only requires a fast MB.
B003H6KRIE|5|Loved this movie in the theatre so I had to buy it on blu ray dvd!  Matt Damon is fantastic!
B00EL8JCGU|2|How much more would they have spent to add some real zombies? The animated walkers looked very fake and ruined the already somewhat goofy storyline. Sadly, it was a big waste of time.
B004SIP9W4|5|Best feel good movie ever!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|4|I really enjoy playing this mahjong game and am glad I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire.  Thank you for offering it.
B004VMUS9G|5|Wakes my daughter up every morning.  She loves the independence!
B00HXYKYIE|5|Really enjoyed this on so many levels
B00SXK316E|1|Amazon instant video service is horrible.  Buffered every few minutes.  We have high speed service and all other online services work fine.  I am asking for refund.  Show is probably good.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I love this game! So glad it finally came to Kindle. It works just like the mobile version. Absolutely awesome!
B00DJFIMW6|5|I believe that this game is very fun and exciting. This makes me smile and enjoy life. I do not know how some parents don't even play this wonderful game. Everyone in your family will be happy.
B00459EZLW|4|cool
0802473156|5|I wish I had read this book many years ago.    I've read many other books, and watched videos on relationships, like 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus', etc., but no other source has helped me understand what women long for the way this single book has.    His explanations are so simple and to the point.  I wrote the 5 languages on index cards and have them as book markers in my Bibles and other books I am reading, so that I can remind myself of each on a regular basis.  If you've ever struggled with trying to figure out what your special lady is hoping for from you, buy and read this book.  The mystery is finally solved.
B007RTAR64|5|my grand daughters loved the dolls!!!!!!!
0811876373|5|It has good tutorials
B005GFPZYK|5|I found it extremely hard to put the book down. Very insightful and intriguing story about a modern day American hero.
B00DRPVE3M|5|One of my favorite childhood games!  It's even better now than before!  I love the graphics &amp; the fact that I get to play with lots of different people with various levels of skill!  Thanks Amazon, for bringing this game back into my life!  LOVE IT!!!
B0035G1K7S|5|Great dvd ... loved it. Very raw and real look in to Jack Black and his artistry.
B00IX9UTLU|3|Ok
B00005JLWN|2|Equilibrium is a fair movie. Almost everything about the production was quite good. But as so often happens with productions like this, it lacks philosophical depth. The conflict between parties is made too black and white. It would have been a much more interesting story if we knew the suffering that drove humanity to that condition, if there was some room for doubt that the protagonist was doing the right thing. A excellent movie leaves you with something to think about. This one does not.
B00BWQW73E|4|Interesting facts and anecdotes. I enjoyed learning about Bezos and Amazon. Writing style was easy to comprehend. Would read again!
B0091REZMW|5|I love playing this game. I play for hours! I c as my wait to download the next one. FUN!
B00MFDQ8DI|3|Entertaining, but definitely had a Hunger Game vibe to it. Felt like it was a cheap knock-off.
B00IIUATDM|5|Great cast=fantastic movie!
B000AU9UYM|5|I have seen all 4 Batman films prior to this one and this one BLOWS ALL OF THEM AWAY (even the still classic 1989 film starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson)! <br /> <br />Christian Bale's version of Batman is very intimidating! I remember watching this film originally in the theater and being scared to death for the guys he interrogated! The villians (Scarecrow/Ra's Al Guhl) were smartly handled well. Rachel, played by Katie Holmes, isn't eye-candy like the previous leading Bat-women. She actually has spunk and guts.  <br /> <br />Overall, all the characters in this film are very believable. For those that still want an \\"Adam West\\" type Batman, please rent the old 1960's film or 1997's \\"Batman & Robin\\" by Joel Schumacher! Otherwise, I'd skip this one because that style of Bats doesn't live here! For everyone else, get ready for great ride! :D
0544104404|5|Anyone interested in the discussion about education gaps, school performance, etc. should read this book.  Tough presents many ideas, supported by both research and practical environments, that show how to address many of the commonly perceived problems in K-12 education.  Not only is it informative, it's a good read.  I've purchased copies for a couple of friends.
B007ZGO7EM|5|The calculator is easy to use and the display uses  the<br />whole screen which makes it easy to see
B005FNJL7K|4|Relaxing music from the movie. None of the harsh blaring \\"industrial\\" tracks from the movie. It is quite nice to listen to on long commutes.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is my guilty pleasure! So much fun!
B001200SQS|5|This is an album that I got my hands on this back in like, I wanna say 93. Anyway I noticed that it was available through amazon & picked it up again. Let me tell you it plays well with others. Other badass heavy metal bands of course, that is. I have it thrown into a playlist consisting of bands like Dethklok, Slipknot,  Machinehead, & Walking Corpse Syndrome. And let me tell you that the age difference is seamless & does not show at all. This album is one of the greatest ever put out buy the Cavalera brothers & even the actual band itself. (A note for those of you who weren't aware. While Sepultura still exist, many members, if not all from the original line-up have moved on.)

B007J4T2G8|5|Of course all the hype going around would normally turn me off of a book. I am not one to read Twilight, romance or general \\"chick\\" books. I stick to mystery and suspense books, but decided to check out this \\"Mommy Porn\\".  Wow! I am so glad I did.<br />I found myself laughing out loud, had tears flowing at certain points, and sometimes my overall mood depended on what happened between Christian and Ana that day.  I read the trilogy in less than five days, finding myself prying my eyes open at one in the morning because I just couldn't bear to put my Kindle down. Not sure if it \\"changes my marriage\\" like some people claim, but I learned a lot about myself and relationships in general from these books.<br />This is one of the few books that makes me sad that I reached the end and I truly miss the characters now that I'm done.
B00G0MLD94|5|These Dolls are lovely. So much detail and thought went into them. This character is my daughters favourite one out of all the 'Ever after High' dolls  so she was a little disappointed that she did not have wolf ears like in the show. Every detail is just like the show so not sure why this very important part of this character was left out. So FYI she does not have the wolf ears. Apart from that she is lovely!!!
B00UENHBAU|5|Survive from spring trap and his withered animatronics as the actor.Or you think you are really for show for the people but you don't see people you see animiatronics!!!AWESOME AND SCARY!!!
0060599847|5|It is very informative and it did spoke of what needs to be done step by step to succeed. But as you all know there are allways barriers sometimes from your Family, demands on the responsibility that either you comply or you risk loosing what you got going on. One day maybe I find the way to overcome those traps.. good luck to all of you. This audio material is simply great...
B000JJCQ68|2|Dvd had some minor damage and some scenes were not included from the original film. The story is based on true events but modified for the screen...
B0000C6E4D|4|I have been listening to Sarah since 1998 and enjoy her music very much.  This is very good stuff.  Mellow, haughting music.  A good CD.
B005FVFWOI|4|To many listeners, \\"Aqualung\\" may be the best, or even the \\"only\\" Jethro Tull recording.  While I may not feel quite so strongly about it, I like this album, and have respect for it creatively and musically.  I was disappointed in previous CD versions of it, and having read a range of reviews for this remastered 2011 release, both positive and negative, I decided I should hear it for myself.<br /><br />Something significant was discovered listening to the first few seconds of the album:  the famous six-note guitar line that opens the title track is heard twice.  This is in fact the correct, original introduction, with the drums entering only after the guitar has repeated the opening figure.  Playing an early vinyl LP of \\"Aqualung\\" I owned years ago had been the last time, until this CD, that I had heard it presented this way.  Later LP pressings and subsequent releases in several configurations dropped the first guitar line.  This confounded me for years just as, I can well imagine, hearing this restoration may baffle anyone who has never before heard the introduction in its original form.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Aqualung\\" is quite impressive, and great credit is due to all members of Jethro Tull, who do a skillful turn realizing Ian Anderson's eclectic, complex music.  Guitarist Martin Barre, who joined the band on \\"Stand Up\\", their second album, struggled a bit on that one, but by the next album (\\"Benefit\\") the refinement of his playing had taken a giant stride.  Next came \\"Aqualung\\", and his performance here, rightly, won him quite a bit of acclaim.  I might also give a special nod to keyboardist John Evan, who first worked with Tull on \\"Benefit\\".  A classically-trained performer, his playing seems specially suited to some of the more baroque moments in this music.<br /><br />Some reviewers give this CD a low rating on the basis of its sound.  I do not take issue with them, as we all hear things in an individual way.  However, I think the sound is about as good ascan be expected, given several factors.  For one thing, CDs just simply have limitations.  Listeners comparing any CD with a vintage vinyl LP of the same music are likely to be disappointed with the former.  In addition, I have heard (not to be quoted here) that the master tape of \\"Aqualung\\" has been lost.  If this is true, there is no telling what was used as a source recording for this current disc.  The 1996, 25th Anniversary release was mastered using special noise reduction technology, raising questions about the source tape then as well.  On this new one, I can detect that attention was given to capturing the dynamic range and, as much as may be possible, the ambient qualities of the original recording.  So, if this one is not perfect, it sounds better to me than earlier CD versions (I should mention that I have not heard the DCC gold disc), and is a worthy effort.<br /><br />The second disc in the set contains some tracks which have been released previously, and a few that have not, all mastered with the same care as the featured album.  It is very nice to have 'Wond'ring Again' included, this time appearing as a kind of extended coda built onto 'Wond'ring Aloud', its companion track from \\"Aqualung\\".  This conjoined version has evidently not been released before, making it seem a worthwhile addition and not just a gimmick.<br /><br />My rating of four stars can be read as four-and-a-half.  I think it is about as good as anything we will see on compact disc.  If this music on CD sounded more like the vinyl record did (which may not be possible), and if a few details such as the inclusion of printed lyrics had been seen to, this would easily rate five stars.
B00D1VKZ3M|4|A fun read! Quick, cute and witty. A feel good book reminding you that it is okay to just be yourself.
B00992CF6W|5|I love the game and its really awesome with the new update but I 've had much more lag since the new update. Also it would be a lot better if they added natural weather like rain and thunder also snow!
0440246008|5|In better condition than I expected.  Inexpensive, accurate description of condition, on-time delivery!!!  A++++++
B0031KC8OC|5|Watched this when it came out.  Started it again recently.  Great characters, cool back story and good future stars.  Worth watching again for sure.
B0089LOG02|4|This well-written and emotional novel tells of the &#34;orphan trains&#34; and the sad children who were transported to the Mid-West to be placed in &#34;good&#34; homes.  I had never known about this part of American history.  While this is a fictional story, there are certainly real-life scenarios that are at least as heartbreaking if not worse.  I enjoyed the majority of the book, in spite of so much cruelty to the destitute children, although the ending was way too trite.  The story wrapped up with a &#34;happily ever after&#34; final chapter that was at odds with the dramatic arc of the story.
B00AIUUXHC|5|Great game
0634023020|2|The cover of this book contains a picture of an an electric guitar.  Accordingly, I assumed that that both the music cd and guitar notation/tablature would pertain to an electric guitar.  However, the music and tablature pertains to an accousitic guitar only - not an electric guitar.  I was diappointed.  This seems to border on false advertising.
B0069G5Z9K|5|I love it! it has great pictures and it is so entertaining. I think everybody would get it and it is free!!!!
B001F6TXME|5|The Nikon 25395 MC-DC2 Remote Release Cord works very nicely, out-of-the-box. I'm using it with my D5100 and had no issues. It also has a nice 'lock' position. It is a must if you're interested in taking tack sharp photographs, especially in low light situations such as shooting at night.
B00NHRCRZY|5|A great Billy Idol record and great detail!
B0000DZEA1|5|just get this, the music is the most PERFECTLY made I have ever heard.  I cannot get enough of these 3 soundtracks, they are pure brilliance.  THe movies could never have been so good if the music wasn't simply incredible, which it is.  I can't sing its praises high enough.  You NEED this in your collection, along with the other three soundtracks.  LOTR rules! <br /> <br />putting Annie Lennox on here for the last track was a stroke of brilliance.  Her singing will bring you to tears
B004Q9TYWQ|5|Wow, my wife found this for my first book on my own kindle.  I cant stop laughing, its soo unbelievably funny.  I'm telling you, buy this book.  Its great!!!
B0054JZC6E|5|This game is awesome !!! It is a really cool game. I play it all the time.On a scale of 1-10 if would be a 8

B00881VLCE|2|I tried a few of the puzzles, but trying to manipulate the pieces was a pain in the behind, and it wasn't the relaxing, amusing game I'd anticipated.  If you absolutely adore jigsaws, then it might be worth it, but I wouldn't recommend it, otherwise.
B004DLPXAO|5|Works incredibly easy!  Clear fonts and easy to use its just a wonderful App and the price of Free can not be beat!
B003YL4LYI|4|Love this series!!
0439023521|1|Bought it, read it, completely unimpressed.  This book is an unrealistic rip-off of Japanese thriller 'Battle Royale' (\\"In the future, the Japanese government captures a class of ninth-grade students and forces them to kill each other under the revolutionary \\"Battle Royale\\" act.\\" - IMDb) plopped into the setting from Scott Westerfield's \\"Uglies\\" trilogy (also disappointing).  Unlike \\"Battle Royale\\", however, Hunger Games has a plot hole so enormous it threatens to swallow you whole - while the Japanese government is taking hostage a group of about 30 children and threatening them with weapons as a means to population control, there's never a clear reason why the eventual \\"uprising\\" that is so momentous in the HG series doesn't happen right from the start. Their pathetic \\"government\\" has no real method of threatening the villagers, and no real population would be so blunderingly obedient in the face of blatant neglect.  Overall this book is horribly predictable, unoriginal, and certainly not worthy of yet another delusional teen fantasy film series a-la 'Harry Potter' and 'Twilight' . Let a good book be a good book; let bad books die. One star because the writing wasn't horrible and MUCH better than a lot of the other teen trash kids are reading these days.
B000002MFE|5|Clapton is fantastically versatile. From the Yardbirds through Cream and The Dominos, everyone who grew up in the 60s knew Eric as the best modern guitar player ever (forget it, Jimi) but even more than that, he speaks directly to every member of his audience through his music in a riveting way.<br />Here, on acoustic guitar, accompanied by one of the greatest pianos you'll ever hear, Eric Clapton sings the blues. Alone onstage to the world.<br />I don't understand why Eric Clapton and Doc Watson have never gotten together. THAT would be something for the ages. But in the mean time, you'll have to buy separate CDs.
B000OT8GCQ|5|nicholas sparks should be crowned and anointed with oil-his work is astonishing. this book is my favorite, it is full of true love and heartbreak. you relate to his charactures so much, he writes like hes writing from his own experiences. its such a real, beautiful book.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|This is a good game for the kids,keeps them busy and keeps the mind on it's toes so to speak..:-)
B000002J29|5|Wow! This was my first ever Genesis album. I bought this and \\"And then there were Three\\" on the same day in 1978. From here I went \\"back in time\\" in regards to the Genesis catalogue whilst eagerly awaiting each next Genesis release (2 years later being the masterpiece known as \\"Duke\\" in 1980).    There is passion, power, superb musicianship and so much emotion throughout this album. Here is a live album from a band fronted by their drummer who appears driven to show they \\"still had it\\" after Peter Gabriel's departure. I really take my hat off to Phil Collins. At this time (1976/1977) Phil was not the \\"success\\" (commercially speaking) of the mid 80's thru to the 90's). In the mid 70's he stepped out from behind the Genesis drumkit  and took on the lead vocal duties and \\"front man\\" role from Peter Gabriel. The passion, drive and determination to succeed just pushes this live album to a classic status. There is hunger and a sense of desperation and emotion that Phil shows vocally throughout the album that needs to be heard to be believed (particularly on \\"Carpet Crawlers\\", \\"Afterglow\\", \\"Musical Box - closing Section\\" and \\"Suppers Ready\\" (to me the definitive version, it is absolutely stunning).   Combine that hunger and the superb musicianship of the band (Tony Banks - Keyboards, Steve Hackett - Guitar) and Mike Rutherford - Bass and Guitar) and you have what to me is one of the greatest Live albums ever. The whole band seems intent on giving the performances of their lives, to move on and succeed after Peter's departure.     Last but not least, the drums. With Phil picking up the Lead Vocal and front man duties a live drummer was required. Initially Bill Bruford (ex Yes / King Crimson) was in the hot seat and plays on \\"Cinema Show\\" on this album. The rest of the tracks feature the new incumbent at the time - Chester Thompson (ex Frank Zappa / Weather Report). Chester went on to remain touring with the band for the next 15 years and its little wonder why. Given the very short time he'd been with the band he gives a stunning display. Chester provides a strong backbone to the songs, and gives the music a certain rhythm and \\"swing\\". The live versions of these songs really benefit from Chester's work, they just feel so alive and energetic, he really plays as though his life depends on it, and he gives 110%! Throughout the album Chester's work  is superb and is simply outstanding on \\"Robbery, Assault and Battery\\", \\"Afterglow\\", \\"Firth of Fifth\\", Musical Box - closing Section\\", \\"Suppers Ready\\" (especially the \\"Apocalypse 9/8\\" section with Phil - stunning!, \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" (including Drum Duel with Phil) and \\"Los Endos\\".  Chester has a certain style and sound and he absolutely rocks).     So, in summary, a fantastic live album and one of my favorite live albums of all time. The band is in absolutely top form. There's something special about this album, an \\"x\\" factor that pushes this album over the top and into classic status. It appears to be almost a hint of \\"desperation\\" that comes thru form two of the band members... Phil stepping into Peter Gabriel's shoes as front man and lead vocals and Chester stepping into Phil's shoes to provide the backbone and rhythm and adding a \\"swing\\" to the Genesis sound that moved them to another dimension live.     I hope you enjoy this album as much as I have over the years, it is so uplifting and musically stunning to listen to - a real classic.    Certainly one of my favourite live albums over the last 35 years (here are some of my other favourites)...     - \\"How the West was won\\" from Led Zeppelin (1972)   - \\"Made in Japan\\" from Deep Purple (1972)   - \\"Yessongs\\" from Yes (1973)   - \\"Welcome back my friends\\" from ELP (1973)   - \\"Too late to stop now\\" from Van Morrison (1974)   - \\"On your feet or on your knees\\" from Blue Oyster Cult (1975)   - \\"Live in London\\" from Bruce Springsteen (1975)   - \\"One more from the Road\\" from Lynyrd Skynrd (1976)   - \\"Frampton comes alive\\" from Peter Frampton (1976)- \\"Live Bullet\\" from Bob Seger (1976)   - \\"Seconds Out\\" from Genesis (1977)   - \\"A Live Record\\" from Camel (1978)   - \\"Bursting Out Live\\" from Jethro Tull (1978)   - \\"Two for the Show\\" from Kansas (1978)   - \\"Playing the fool\\" Gentle Giant (1978)   - \\"Waiting fro Columbus\\" from Little Feat (1978)   - \\"Strangers in the Night\\" from UFO (1979)   - \\"Live Rust\\" from Neil Young (1979).   - \\"Paris\\" from Supertramp (1980).   - \\"Exit...Stage left\\" from Rush (1981)   - \\"Under a blood red sky\\" from U2 (1983)   - \\"Stop making sense\\" from Talking Heads (1984)   - \\"Live in the city of Light\\" from Simple Minds (1986)   - \\"Live adventures of the Waterboys\\" from the Waterboys (1986)   - \\"Operation Livecrime\\" from Queensryche (1991)   - \\"Without a safety Net\\" from Big Country (1992)   - \\"Secret World Live\\" from Peter Gabriel (1994)   - \\"Together in Concert\\" from Tim Finn, Dave Dobbyn, Bic Runga (2000)   - \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" from Dream Theater (2000)   - \\"Hullabaloo\\" from Muse (2002)   - \\"Out West\\" from Gomez (2005)   - \\"Instant Delivery\\" from Flower Kings (2006).   - \\"Okonokos\\" from My Morning Jacket (2006)
B000BJS4TO|4|An incredibly beautiful piece of work.  One of those rare soundtracks that actually surpasses the movie it's from and easily one of John Williams' best non-Star Wars works ever.  Sayouri's Theme is worth the price of the CD alone.
B00CB4ET0K|5|I do enjoy this game but it's very frustrating. It's says win vest when win level 10 ,it's not working. Also it's expensive when you have to buy glue money to get the better weapons, armor, etc.  The best of the best machine gun is 99.00 in real money. WOW.... just too expensive.

B0011Z8S8E|5|wonderful item
B00D8HNR5W|4|I always liked Nine Inch Nails, Downward Spiral, and Further Down being my favorites, but this one is as good as any.  It is a little more on the electronica side of style but an excellent album. I do like the soundtracks of The Social Network better as someone who likes instumentals but if you like Reznor singing buy this album....very solid.
B00T3DNKIE|3|I'm glad I read the book.  Having read early reviews helped me put the &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird&#34; characters in perspective.  Not much of an ending.
B00JBGWP3Y|5|Good move. Enjoyed it, Russell Crowe always great.

B000I157KO|4|Definitely was the film that ushered in the New Hollywood Cinema. Great use of music when both character can hear it, small use of words lets us get into visually what is going on. Love it that Thomas is a flawed h u man in a personal struggle
B00004RHZU|5|Okay, well, maybe this album wouldn't appeal to all people. But, if you're a fan of up tempo r&amp;b and Timberland-style beats, you'll love this CD. There are only two slow songs, which is really rare for and r&amp;b/soul  singer. Pink has a terrific voice and I commend her for her honesty in her  songs. Yes, she actually does write her own material! Here are the tracks:  1.SPLIT PERSONALITY: A very strong opening. The chorus is so cool and  different and Pink's &quot;split personality&quot; mouthing off in the  background is hilarious. 2.HELL WIT YA: A more typical r&amp;b song, but,  it is higlighted by Pink's wonderful lyrics (she says wench! ) and her  terrific delivery of them. Her delivery on this whole album is mucho bueno.  3.MOST GIRLS: This song benefits from over the top production (there are  opera singers) and the strength of the melody. It's very, very cool. One of  the better tracks. 4.THERE YOU GO: Of course, if you've heard this song,  you know about the singing/rap aspect of it and hopefully, you love it.  However, if you don't like this song don't buy the album cause it's just  like all the other songs practically. 5.YOU MAKE ME SICK: This song has a  really cool chorus with really cool lyrics. The verses are kinda weird and  pretty fast. 6.LET ME LET YOU KNOW: Another outstanding song. The first  ballad on the album, you will fall in love with this song after repeat  listens, guaranteed. 7.LOVE IS SUCH A CRAZY THING: This song would not be  half as good if it didn't have the awesome piano opening and the really  crazy beats. It's kinda a weird song. 8.PRIVATE SHOW: A standard Destiny's  Child/TLC uptempo song. It has cool lyrics though. 9.CAN'T TAKE ME HOME:  This is a completely awesome song! It's probably my favorite. It has the  fastest, angriest beats ever. She scares me on this one. 10.STOP FALLING:  the second and last ballad, and also the slowest. The first time I listened  to this one I didn't like it at all. But, after repeat listens Ifell in  love with it. It is such a sad, good song. And so suddle too. 11.DO WHAT U  DO: Kinda reminds me of Vitamin C! It's a very good, kinda campy, self  empowerment song. It's pretty good though. 12.HICCUP: This is a really cool  song. In the chorus it sounds like she's hiccuping which gives the song a  really cool affect. Very addicting chorus. 13.IS IT LOVE: This is a nice,  suddle, mid-tempo song. It's got a real cool beat that reminds me of Dr.  Dre for some reason. It's a good ending song.     ~ no lyrics included.
B00005RFAI|3|I love this cd. It rocks!!! Almost every song on this cd meets my disire and I am lovin' it!!

B00003CWLF|5|This has to be one of the best versions of Margaret Landon's book that was published in 1944 from Anna Leonowen's accounts from her regarding her teaching in Siam (Thailand) as a royal school teacher. The other two that I had previous seen over the years were good but somewhere a long the line I didn't enjoy it as much as this one. I don't know probably they found the right place to film the movie, got the sets well presented, the costumes where thoroughly researched and the storyline seem to have been taken into context out of the book instead of it just wondering off dancing or singing whatever I saw in the King and I.<br />Jodie Foster was a great actor in this movie, she was perfect for the role and we could see the emotional side of her which made it more dramatic and not as light-hearted as I though it was supposed to be. There was a seriousness in the air but over all I really liked the role that she played. Chow Yun Fat also played a great king with great expression involved and the manner in speaking as well his Thai I found pretty sharp and good too. However in real life the king would have been around about 60s years old when Anna came to teach the royal court. King Mongkut wouldn't have been this young since he spent most of his life in the monastry and only became king at a late age when his brother died leaving the throne to him. The wives and concubines of the kings were dressed in the exact costumes that I have seen in old photographs in Thailand, therefore showing thorough search and studies went through to try and get everything as accurate as possible. I enjoyed the princes and princess dressed in their court clothes which was very pleasing and wonderful enjoyable.<br />The beginning of the movie was enough, I knew that his movie was going to be better than the others I have seen. The streets with all the busy people, the elephants and the scene where they move from the lower part of the city towards the roofs of houses where you can see the Royal Palace of Bangkok was execellent. Bai Ling playing the role of Tuptim was excellent and she was a very sad character at times but in the trial she was fierce and expressed her other side which was hidden from view showing what she believed in.<br />Overall this movie will make you want to get a box of tissues to wipe your eyes and other times it's serious with a few high-hearted scenes. This is excellent and I wonder if they are going to make another version of this in years to come??? I don't know but I know this will be centre of the stage for a long time before it's replaced. This has lightened and gave a different perception of the movie from the other two which seems to be more focused on Anna and not those all around her.Palace of Bangkok was execellent.

B001BKVWYG|5|Already had the vinyl.  Just wished there were more albums to purchase from this special man!
0441003257|4|I think it was the comparison to Hitchhiker's Guide that prompted me to purchase Good Omens and I'm glad I did. It's definatley a different kind of book, with the side notations and the references to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter.  How is the Apocalyspe funny? You'll have to read it to believe it. I bet you like the antichrist, too.
B00B7NPRY8|5|The Dune series of books has long been one of my favorites.  I've read it several times and have the movie as well.  I've been trading in hardbound books for Kindle versions to save space, and I am looking forward to obtaining the rest of the series again.
B002ZFQD0E|5|This album is a continuation of the Metropolis album.  The works do tell a story, albeit a story that not everyone will appreciate.  The story is of a futuristic society where humans and androids collide, or is it a fight by those in power to oppress the underclass to maintain superiority.  The music is a combination of lyrical hip hop, techno beats, and movie score orchestration.  Who would have thought it would work?
140053271X|5|For all people confused on whether to get a nook or kindle...hopefully this helps!  After hours of researching countless articles and watching reviews, I thought the nook would be the best choice for me.  Turns out I made a great decision! I used to be a strict physical book junkie, but now I enjoy reading both my nook and regular books.  The thing that gets me is that I can bring it practically EVERYWHERE (in the car, doctor's office) rather than bringing my huge hardcover books.  It's really a wonderful product.  Here's some highlights that won me over (before and after):  -After I charged my nook for the first time, the battery lasted about a month before dying, which is really great!  -Light, nice grip to hold  -LOVE the touch screen! When I'm at the gym I just tap on the screen and it's so much easier to read than holding pages on a real book (which I don't mind either)  -Format of the books are awesome, I love how you can see the covers.  -flashes EVERY SIX PAGES!! this feature made the biggest impact on my decision.  I absolutely hated how the kindle flashed on every page.  Huge turn-off for my reading experience.  Things that aren't so good:  -Touch screen freezes randomly (ie. when I accidently highlight something)...but it doesn't happen very often.  I'm not that upset because all I have to do is reboot it and then it works perfectly again.  I'm expecting the system updates will solve that in the near future. I'm pretty sure they are working on it right now!  -ebooks are the same price (sometimes more) than a physical book.  UPDATE (2/19/12)  nook update fixed the freezing!! my nook has been performing beautifully since my purchase in august!! :) i am a happy reader! GET THIS INSTEAD OF THE KINDLE! my friend has the kindle touch and it's way too unorganized.  I love my nook because it still has buttons for those people who can't entirely adjust to an all touch screen device.  For some reason buttons make me feel very comfortable, but I do however use the touch screen every once in a while.  You don't get that luxury with the kindle! I LOVE MY NOOK! After playing around with my friend's kindle (she got it last month), it just reminded me that I made the right decision. yay nook!!  some advice..  -BUY A CASE OFF AMAZON! I got one for like 16 bucks and it's the best case I've ever had.  -Purchase the nook in best buy. They have extended warranties and they are great on customer service. Or you don't have to. Your choice.  So, all I have to say is... I LOVE MY NOOK! It makes me want to read more books because they're so accesible! At first, I was worried I wasted money, but this is truly a fine product. I really can't wait to grow old with it.  hope this helps!  happy reading!

0307454541|5|Mikael Blomkvist was a financial investigative reporter, and publisher, for Millennium magazine. That was until he was convicted of libel after he published an article on Swedish businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr&ouml;m. For that, he is to spend three months in prison and pay a hefty fine. His career as a journalist is in serious doubt and he resigns from his position of publisher of Millennium. However, a Swedish industialist, Henrick Vanger commissions him to write his biography and that of his company Vanger Corporation. The commission will provide him with a substantial payday. Henrick, however, has an ulterior motive; years ago, his grand niece, Harriet Vanger, went missing and is presumed dead. He would like Mikael to turn his investigative eye on that incident, to determine who in his family murdered her.<br /><br />The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, by Stieg Larsson, is much like a locked room murder mystery. On the day Harriet went missing, an accident tied up traffic on the only access point from the island where the Vanger family was holding a meeting. All of the Vanger clan was present and there was no way on or off the island for several hours. Yet, Harriet's body was never found. As he writes the biography, Mikael discovers he has a need for a very good research assistant, and is recommended to contact Lisabeth Salander, a \\"strange\\" twenty-four year old, more at home in front of her computer than dealing with others. The relationship starts on rocky ground, as it is revealed that Lisabeth performed a very thorough background check of Mikael for Henrick Vanger. It is an interesting pairing, one that begins to uncover a truth that may turn deadly.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson crafted a complex, well executed mystery with excellent characters. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo starts slowly, which may tax some readers. It is also rather complex, especially when dealing with the extended Vanger family. To alleviate some confusion, a Vanger family tree is included, thankfully, and will be used many times during reading. For some readers, dealing with Swedish names and places may also pose some challenges. However, after the first 100 pages, or so, it gets much easier. And much more rewarding. Mikael and Lisabeth are excellent characters; complex, interesting, unforgettable, and one's with which the reader empathize. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo keeps your interest, and keeps you reading long past a normal hour, due to the story arcs; the history of the Vanger family, Mikael's resurrection as an investigative journalist, Lisabeth's attitudes and maturation, and the mystery of Harriet Vanger. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained from: Book store<br />Payment: Purchasedbe used many times during reading.

B0086700CM|5|Excellent
B00004X01U|5|amazing
B003TSEL7S|5|It was a great book because all the mysterious missing people and people losing there memories .(5star)<br />Yay yay yay
B00A6CCF0K|5|I always wondered what happened to Danny Torrence and his mom. Great story and was very hard to put down.
B0041KKYGU|5|My now ex wife loved this movie we watched it a lot. It's a great movie Cameron really embraced the bad girl role and she looked amazing and it was funny.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Surprised that it arrived earlier than expected. Easy to setup and use. Main reason for purchase was ability to view YouTube videos and it works beautifully for that. [Note: I dropped cable years ago and Roku lacks a YouTube channel.]<br /><br />Why good, not great? Device runs hot which is a bit of concern because heat is not good for electronic devices. Also, the &#34;channel&#34; content available is still limited. While this was known at time of purchase it has been several weeks and nothing additional has arrived.
B004SD5GZ4|5|I have used Abobe reader over the years and it has never failed to handle a .pdf document. The do upgrades all the time the program is very easy to understand.
B00BVYLBP2|5|I was blissfully surprised when I decided to give this show a viewing a few weeks ago. The acting is unbelievable and Tatiana gives marvelous performances in each role she plays - they're all distinct personalities pulled off flawlessly. Also, one of the things that normally turns me off about shows where 1 person plays multiple roles are the awkward camera angles and 'split screen' visuals that you get. Orphan Black has completely blown me away with how seamless the shots flow together when there's two, three even four different characters onscreen at the same time. I forget that they're all the same actor and am left to simply enjoy the show. I wish I could give more than 5 stars, but I think everyone should watch this.
B00F9F1G4U|5|great app.
B004P1JEXE|5|Keeps you wanting more. I was gutted it finished when it did. I'm straight off to get the next one.
B00AEFXKUI|5|I have always loved this movie.  I could watch it once a week for the next twenty years and never grow tired of seeing it.
B005GFPZYK|5|This was wrote as if you were sitting on the back porch swapping stories. Amazing. A true hero in every aspect of the word. Amazing, simply amazing
B008QE9XD2|5|excellent and what else can you say ' Johnny Depp&#34;..... :)
B00DPM7TIG|5|This is the best book I have read in years.  I was sorry that it ended.  The descriptions, the style of writing and the characters were fagnificent.  Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.
B00B2JSRAS|5|This was an easy read but by no means light. I haven't done the exercises yet, but expect positive results. Highly recommended!
B00BVYNSLC|4|It was amazing acting for the lead playing 8 different people
B00FQPHOPI|5|thank you
B000063DFS|5|Works great
0545123275|2|Didn't enjoy this book at all. It was as bland as winter. Always had to look & see who's chapter I was on. Didn't enjoy the characters or the story. Won't waste my time or money finishing the series.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This story brought about many questions about my life and just how fragile we all our in more ways than we can count.
B00I2TV3NO|5|Great movie! Waiting for the next one!
B00IK590UI|3|Love the action. Movie was short of expectation when it came to actually fight criminals. too much talk, specially 2nd part.
B0053O89WY|5|The dialogues are excellent and their acting is superb. I can say the same of the other &#34;Big Bang Theory&#34; seasons.
B006M3JVD6|4|The author was kidnapped as a young girl and used as a sex slave for many years. She holds no punches in describing what the kidnapper does to her, giving graphic descriptions of everything that happened during the time. I have heard of crimes like this in the news before but never a first hand account. This is a well written account by a very brave person.
B00003CXCT|3|I bought this at a retail store and watched Empire and it was ok.  Then I put in A New Hope and 57 minutes into the movie, it paused and restarted from the beginning.  I went to chapter 27 and reversed it to a little bit after the error and it did it again.  I returned it today and the lady said \\"Oh, another one\\".  Apparently somebody else had the same problem I did but on A New Hope and Empire.  However, the exchanged version of A New Hope did not have the same problem.   Beware!  Watch all 3 movies before you throw away your receipt.
B006LSZECO|3|Although I found the complexity of the twists and turns by the author admirable, I found the book to be disbelievable. I think it would make a good Lifetime movie choice.
B003K07DUC|4|A very good production, indicating what might have happened or maybe really did happen with WMD media misrepresentation. Matt Damon is a very professional actor and very believable in his portrayal of a concerned officer and the tasks assigned to him and his men. Watched this presentation twice to gain the true flavor of the movie.
B004SD5GZ4|5|As advertised
B00W3V83QW|4|Have to wait to long to get lives when entering new stage. 24 hours is too long .
B00B8BR6CU|5|A wonderful movie about losing and finding your gift and then sharing it with the world.  Fantastic cast and story
B005K0HDGE|2|starts out good..then fizzles out as writer appears to lose interest in keeping the reader interested...but good if you have the time to continue on HOPING the plot is leading somewhere....
B00AZMFO6I|5|one of my all time favorites
B000P0J0AQ|3|Fast shipment, DVD quality not there, movie skips, some scenes shorter then normal. If it's o.k. quality you can deal with as a o.k. price then this is for you.
B0071XO8RA|5|Wool was an excellent, easy, but entertaining read.  I do like how amazon grouped the first 5 books together for us kindle users.
B00785P2QC|4|I love this game. doesn't require too much and easy to understand. in a little over 2 days I had quite a few homes factories and entertainment entities. I'm not too much into social networking though and hate the fact that some tasks require posting pic on fb etc.
B008JDAC7G|4|Fun addictive Game. I have enjoyed every game I have gotten from Adult Swim and this one is no exception.
B004DI7HZ6|1|I would love to read this book, unfortunately I am on a budget and can't afford $12.99 for a kindle book.  My personal limit is $9.99, then it has to be by an author I truly love to follow.  Sorry, no sale here, not at that price.
B005PK57NU|5|Can't stop watching it! Great program!
B004UNX1LS|2|As for the technical side of things, the app ran fine (on a Kindle Fire) although it was a little slow.<br /><br />It's even free which is a plus.<br /><br />However, there's not a lot of room for personalizing your music. The only thing on the home page is pop, and if you don't like that kind of music you have to deal with it because<br />they don't offer any way to customize your home screen.<br /><br />The only thing that come close to personalizing something is adding a playlist; however the app doesn't take this into account when suggesting videos to watch. I also tried logging onto facebook,<br />but that didn't help either.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great idea but it'd be better if you could personalize it to fit your music style.
B00H58VGIA|3|It was truly the worst of times. The women whose lives were interwoven were all strong and unaccepting of their lot in life.  Good read but would have been better without Oprah\\"s comments.
B000CNFC76|5|Great
B0001AP12G|4|Kanye will never be greater then tupac or biggie. But Kanye is the greatest thing that has been in the rap game since Tupac-lyrically. Kanye West, next big thing. Finally some truly excellent rap.
B008JFURKG|3|Not as good as the first one.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is the best game ever. I love the Meena battle and Vector battle. This game is full of Minion packed fun.<br />Go Minions
B00843TZJ2|5|Great recording
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I enjoyed them. They were great! I am totally enchanted with the series. I would definitely recommend all the seasons.
B00004CZIZ|5|I had been searching for this product for awhile, not only was it exactly what I wanted, but the source took a personal aproach and made sure I had the product in my hands sooner than later. I am very appreciative to this, and will definately be ordering from this source in the future.  A good man that does very good business.
B00AN0KBJC|3|This was a pleasant overview of some of the design work that went into the Game of Thrones sets. I wanted more depth than what it offered.
B005IQZB14|5|Great read! I normally wouldn't have read this, but it was recommended to me, so I did. I am so glad I read it; it easily transforms you to the trail and you feel like you are hiking right along with Cheryl.
B000002U94|4|I agree with the other reviewers that this is a better greatest hits collection than the actual greatest hits CD.  however, it hardly sounds like a live album.  When seger achieved commercial success he fell into the  same trap that the eagles have always been in - playing the songs *exactly*  as they were recorded in the studio.  &quot;Old Time Rock &amp; Roll&quot;  is the only song that sounds different with it's extended intro and lower  key presumably so Bob could handle the vocals live.  If you're looking for  a place to start your seger collection and want to start with the hits then  definitely buy this one first.  However, if you're looking for some great  live seger drop everything you're doing and pick up Live Bullet.  Now  *that* is a five-star album!
B0095VPBM2|5|Item arrived on time.  I immediately sat down to install it into my motherboard.  Only then did I realize that is was not a fit for my motherboard.  I returned it and purchased another CPU that is installed and working fine.  Small inconvenience.
B008M7BQHE|5|Love this show
B00EMXBDMA|5|This book is pure engineering porn. The sheer number of problems ingeniously overcome is boggling, and all with a wit and quiet determination that I found downright inspiring.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved it so much. I'm not a big reader and I read this book in less than a week! :)
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Nice children's game
B006S01GH2|5|Fun and entertaining. I couldn't get enough of the star. She is adorable, unpredictable and very entertaining. I could and willwatch this movie more than once.
B00C7KXUOE|5|Just watch it, you wont be sorry. Character development and cinematography is excellent. Writing is awesome. All the makings of a great drama.
B000I9TY4G|4|I thoroughly enjoyed the series Firefly. It wasn't until the last couple episodes that I really became indignant that there were no more. Too many ends were fraying. Of course I had to watch the movie! It did a good job of bringing things together and tying up those ends. I may end up buying the graphic novels that explain a bit more of what happened in between. Anyway, it was a good story.
B009NFHF0Q|3|I love creepy, ethereal plot lines as much as the next guy, but this one was a little too much like stepping into an acid trip.
B00992CF6W|5|It's good if you are new to minecraft but it isn't  the same as the pc version though<br />but if you don't want to pay like $30 it's worth it
B005DD7H50|5|Two thumbs up, 5 stars.
0345803493|5|I usually hate these types of books but these were strangely addictive. Enjoyed them
B009WUAK2M|4|I enjoyed it but it wasn't the type of movie you see if you are wanting great acting and or award winning scenes. Just an action flick with just about every major actor from this genre. I recommend this to anyone who wants to just camp on the couch for a few hours and watch the action.
1401207510|2|As other reviewers have commented on the ridiculous price and lack of any additional materials in this \\"absolute\\" edition, I'll skip that although I agree with what they said.<br /><br />The book presents the continuing adventures of Murray and Quatermain, here younger versions of themselves fleeing a post-Big Brother-post-WWII world.  Their adversary is Jimmy, grandson of Campion Bond from Volume 1.  Like his ancestor, Jimmy at best is semi-competent; unlike his ancestor he seems to enjoy success with the ladies.  The graphic portions of the text are interspersed with mostly-prose segments of the 'Black Dossier' itself, and detail how Murray knocks Jimmy's teeth out, steals the 'Black Dossier' itself, and then rejoins Quatermain for a boring escape to a boring alternate-reality.  It is 3-D, and that's the best thing you can say for it.  Sound like it would have taken up about 3 panes in Volume 1?  Yep.  Here it's an agonizing multi-page affair.  So much for the graphic portions.<br /><br />The mostly-prose 'Black Dossier' itself is similar to the lengthy Travelogue at the end of Volume 2, except less interesting, much longer, and written in a bunch of affected styles that make reading it a trying and numbing experience.  If you like to think you're piecing together some sort of coherent storyline assembled from innuendo, poor spelling, and gigantic run-on sentences, maybe you'll like it.  To me, it's pretty much crap.  Sad to think that such an exceptional beginning (Volume 1) ran through a humdrum conclusion (Volume 2) and then gets smeared by association with this ending...
B00OXE341G|5|I love this and so does my daughter.
B00DJFIMW6|4|lil it good I j u st got it l o l it g o o d ddddddd dbbbdd dhbdd dshshdhd dhdbdhdhd. djdjejdj sun. seeds
B0089LOG02|5|excellent
B0099TJ4YQ|4|James Taylor is a great musician. Singing Christmas carols is just icing on the cake.
B00632HWOG|3|yes, I get my email but....it suddendly closes and doesn't display all of the mail in my inbox even though it says I have like 40 more emails.
B004Q7E0TA|3|Portia de Rossi is absolutely gorgeous, inside and out.  This book gives us insight into her insecurities she faced as she became a model and then an actress.  These insecurities ultimately led to anorexia and bulimia.  She writes in detail how she calorie-counts and her exercise regimen.  And she is painfully honest when she lists the foods she binged on.  The other battle was hiding the fact that she is gay, and how she hid this from not only Hollywood but the majority of her family.    This book substantiated to me just how silly and superficial our society is (with the help from Hollywood).  Poor Portia weighed 110 lbs at 5\\"8' which is considered underweight by BMI, but people delight at how good she looks??  Then there is the woman telling a 12-year-old that she has a \\"saggy butt\\"??      Upon finishing the book, I felt that this book was not complete.  There were small side stories that she never finished.  For example, she was very concerned about telling the producers of \\"Arrested Development\\" about her being gay but never reveal to us the conversation or what happened.  I guess we assume that they were okay with it since she was on the show??  Readers should not have to assume so much.  And what happened to the one NY friend who actually noticed she was too thin?  Is she still friends with her?  Who knows - she is never mentioned again.    Also, I noticed by the middle of the book, I was skimming some parts because I did not need another description of how fat her thighs were or how she prepared the perfect 300 calorie meal.  The epilogue was excellent because it contained more in-depth thoughts and discoveries.  I wished the whole book was more like the epilogue.
B00RL9UZGW|5|Loved it!
B00005JKJA|1|David Lynch is an acquired taste, bad taste.  Another example of overused and underdeveloped Lynch film cliches.  I can only imagine that folks who think this is a great film, 5 stars, are afraid that people might think they are unsophisticated if they do not drool over this and other Lynch films.  Not worth purchasing for a dime at a garage sale.  I mean how many damn times can one director use the dream as allegory?  Alice Cooper did it better in Welcome To My Nightmare.  Maybe Lynch can pick a few bucks up making bad videos for Metal Bands.
B00DW3GAEC|5|I consider this movie as authentic on facts and very well paced. though the attitude of characters shown seem slightly exaggerated on both sides. A very enjoyable moviie
B008JFUUIA|5|My niece is a big fan of this movie and wanted it for Christmas.  Now she can play the cup song over and over.
B004MC8CA2|5|I love this app! I use it on a daily basis to read my Bible reading plans. I love to have the Bible with me everywhere I go. I use it on my phone to listen to my 1 year Bible plan in the car. I also like that I can download versions to my Kindle Fire to use when I'm not connected to wifi. Best Bible App EVER! Thanks LifeChurch.tv!!!
B000003TA4|5|Art is the Freedom of Expression of ones feelings.Unlike those who gave this album a low rating,Kurdt did not discriminate against any of his feelings.He let it all hang out the good, the bad, and the ugly.On NEVERMIND self expression was always the goal.The goal was Not to impress others only to express himself.Some say this album is depressing and you know they're right but it's also rebellous,scary,funny,sad, and dumb.But whatever it is it's always Kurt.When i listen to this album i can't make a judgement whether it's good or bad because i'm too busy relating to it.<BR> now let me meat the review requirements-- this album contains harsh yet sometimes smooth tones that lay a top a bed of slow and fast rythmes.Sometimes Kurdt will hit the guitar hard sometimes softly.Most of the time Kurdt sings sometimes others will harmonize.It sounds a lot like pinkfloyd or rush but different and also there is dave and krist who play in a psycho funny depressingly meaningful ground breaking repetetive kind of way.In summary this album is well produced grunge with a twist of lemon.Please ignore my review and get nevermind.
B0069UP2PI|3|Although this film might appear to be a slightly more sophisticated take on the deadly virus meme than, say, \\"Outbreak\\"--and featuring an A-list ensemble cast--it is actually something a bit more peculiar than that: it's a film in which the protagonist never actually appears. That protagonist is, of course, the virus itself.<br /><br />Although every character's story revolves around the deadly outbreak--from the unfortunate Patient Zero (Gwyneth Paltrow) to the compassionate WHO doctor (Marion Cotillard) to the earnest CDC investigator (a disturbingly stiff Kate Winslet) to the muckraking blogger (Jude Law) who sees a conspiracy at work --the film tells the story of the virus: its insinuation into the world population, the havoc it wrecks on humanity, the race to find a vaccine, and the ultimate resolution. Steven Soderbergh creates an appropriate sense of chaotic detachment, mirroring what in all likelihood would actually happen in the event of such an outbreak, and he quite realistically depicts the almost bureaucratic way in which such a pandemic would be \\"managed,\\" leaving us with a sense that a global viral outbreak would prove to be more than \\"just\\" a health crisis. What is most chilling about this film is its eerie verisimilitude and its uncanny portrayal of business-as-usual amidst the calamity of a global catastrophe.
B00FAXJHCY|5|This is a rare piece of literature that feels perfect in every way. The chosen style for most of the narrative, consisting of log entries written by the protagonist, is spot on. The character of the protagonist is believable; it feels entirely convincing that such a guy would write in such a way, and that he could actually survive and maintain his sanity. All the technology feels like something we could achieve in near future, if we got our best minds and resources on it. Everything related to space travel and life on Mars feels plausible: we could really achieve that! Highly recommended for all space enthusiasts.
B004LQEYAG|5|Well written.  Well acted.  Newman and Redford are outstanding as Butch and Sundance.  One of the best westerns of all times.  Everyone will enjoy this movie.
B00CWY76CC|5|It is a very interesting and exciting game that really made me think. It was very entertaining as well I recommend this game.
B002BWP49C|2|This is the kind of stuff that makes you think our cultures are killing off the last bastion of good taste. This stuff is reprehensible day time soap garbage. Not a damn thing worth saying here except that people who yearn for this stuff and live for it need to be dumped on an island. Cull the herd. I cannot even believe this is what is popular with kids today. Why? Because marketing, TV, and whatever the hell else have convinced these morons that this is what they want and need. Never has their been a time of worst taste in the mainstream except the mid 80s. Never. Even then it was forgivable as the decade was pretty much lost anyway. We should know better. The TV has inundated people with this stuff and their minds are so vacant and susceptible that they think these kinds of films and books are somehow any good. The acting is awful, the direction pitiful, and the whole thing just reeks of cold-hearted sleaze.
B008SAZHLQ|5|When I first saw this book in a book shop and read the back of it, I just knew I had to read it. It seemed so genuine and real. And I was right. It's been a very long time, if ever, I read a book that has described young love this well. The characters didn't seem overdone or wise beyond their years as many of these books do. Nor was the story a cliche. When it ended, I wasn't ready at all, this is one of those books that I just wish would go on forever.
B004EFYZ1C|2|Pretty useless and executes by itself to tell you the phase of the moon.  I deleted it from my phone.
B00CBRADU2|4|This movie is unabashed shoot-em-up bang bang, which is exactly what I wanted to see.  Great fun!  Don't take it seriously.
B00005JKQX|5|Russell Crowe is BRILLIANT, AMAZING. I have never been so riveted by a movie or by an actor's performance. 10 stars!
0399208534|5|This is a wonderful and fun book for young children (toddler through preschool age). It can be used to help them learn the days of the week, counting, and color identification.  It can also be used to suppliment a science lesson on the life cycle of the caterpillar/butterfly.  I have read and used this book countless times with my own children, and they can't seem to get enough of it.  They love the holes and the small pages throughout the story; those aspects of the book allow the story to be interactive with youngsters as it's being read.  I think that the illustrations are magnificent.  Eric Carle's use of bold colors and his technique in which the pictures are drawn, are what really make this book captivating.  Each time I would read this story to my children, they would notice something different, that might have been overlooked the previous time, and they would just be in awe!  As for the style of the literature, it is written very simple.  It has short sentences, and uses a lot of repetition, which also allows young children to \\"read\\" along with you because they know what will be said.
B000OLGCI4|5|Recipient loved it.
B0040I09RM|5|Great series.  Instantly addicted.
B006XF5BTG|5|I just finished the book and I'm excited to give it a shot. I'll be sure to come back with some results.<br /><br />Thanks Mike!
B00H71PHS0|5|So enjoy the acting and sets.  The story is compelling and believable.  Transports me with ease to another time in history.
B007PTJOV0|5|Great game with nice graphics. Reminds me of super Mario games. Really couldn't believe it was free. Thank you very much!!
B0013ND30M|5|I purchased this for my daughters 3rd birthday and she loves it! It is wonderful to be able to share memories from my childhood with her!
B000ZLFALI|5|What a beautiful movie, filled with fantastic music !!  This is a true hidden gem, ... except for all the awards it won in Sundance !!
B000002LMK|5|Neil Young, in all his incarnations never seems as focused or full tilt as when he and Crazy Horse hit the stage or studio together.  This tour-de-force of feedback, white noise and amp farts is no exception.   Everything gels in some of the most melodic hard rock blasting this side of  nowhere.  Country Home and Mother Earth are simply two of the most  perfectly constructed grunge-fests ever recorded, and sandwiched in between  are eight other delights for any fan of strong-armed guitar rock.  How Neil  can record perfect hard rock like this and follow so shortly with one of  the most beautiful CDs of the 90's (Harvest Moon) is beyond me.  He is  truly a North-American treasure who despite his revered status is hugely  underrated!  Ragged Glory deserves at least 6 stars, buy it now, then snap  up his entire 70's catalogue, you'll be glad you did!
B00OGPK4SI|5|Love dis lady here thanx soo much!!
B00GTCECVG|5|This is like clash of clans but this is better you get to keep your army troops if they survived which I like about you would probably like it to
B00RW1J8RG|4|It was really nice to see a good Dracula film made again. It has been too long since we've had a decent Vlad &#34;The Impaler&#34; story on the screens. I enjoyed watching this movie for its lack of drag, amazing shots and its own twists on the events.
B00B0LPYXG|5|Excellent movie. It was what an excellent story that makes you think in the concecunces  of never accept your problems.
B007THA4FI|1|I tried to like this book, but had no success.  I enjoy a book where the characters grab my interet.  I kept reading but this never happened.  It finally got to the point where, after 100+ pages, I threw in the towel.  Ms. Rowling should stick to what she does best.
B00992CF6W|5|Cool app really just download it its awesome so cool I so really like it go to the nether download pocketinveditor and edit inventory so fun

0553582445|3|I am sorry to say that this book was something of a disappointment to me. I thoroughly enjoyed the Farseer Trilogy, consider the Liveship Traders trilogy to be some of my favorite books ever... and then there is this. Don't get me wrong; it was wonderful to see Fitz and Chade and the rest again, and I realize that this is the first installment of a trilogy, but I guess I expected more of a plot from Ms. Hobb. Once the story got going, it never ammounted to what it suggested. The concepts were promising, but in the end it was little more than a chase scene and some dialogue. Still, Hobb is a gorgeous writer and knows her characters, which is enough for me to keep reading.
0312360258|3|Marked by P.C. Cast is a new take on vampirism. In Cast's version vampires have always existed...and in fact they are pretty much the leaders when it comes to art and musical exploits - if its famous it was most like done by a vampire....including Shakespeare, the Amazons, Nicole Kidman & Kenny Chesney to name a few. To become a vampire in Cast's world a person isn't bitten. There is some chemical/genetic make up in a person's blood that causes him/her to go through 'the change' when a teenager. When teens start to go through the change they get marked by an adult vamp with a crescent shaped outline on their forehead and head off to the nearest vampire school for training/education in the ways of vamps.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is one such teen who gets marked when she is 16. Zoey is a typical girl struggling to fit in with the popular crowd while dealing with an uber religious and strict step-father. Zoey is unlike most teens in that she is highly judgmental of the the vices that teenagers are faced with. For example, if you do drugs or drink you are a loser. Now while I applaud Zoey's ability to resist temptation it often comes across as unrealistic dialog and just screams of the author preaching to a captive audience. Another thing that makes Zoey different is that shortly after she is marked her crescent outline becomes filled in....something that only happens when one is an adult vampire. This sets her apart from everyone else at the private school called The House of Night that she must attend while she goes through the change.<br /><br />While at the school she meets and bonds with 4 kids who are existing on the fringes of the student body and she quickly makes an enemy of the most popular girl in school, Aphrodite. Because Zoey's mark is different Aphrodite initially tries to recruit Zoey into her circle. But Aphrodite is mean and vindictive and Zoey not only sees through her but also becomes the only person brave enough to stand up to her. A rivalry is then born. One that I am sure will continue throughout most of the series.<br /><br />Overall the book wasn't bad and I enjoyed the different take on what it means to become a vampire. However, the dialog always seemed a little forced. It was as if Cast was trying too hard to speak teen. Which was further strained when she got onto her soap box to speak out against sex, drugs and peer pressure. Another issue that I had was the overuse of parenthesis (I mean seriously there was something within them every other paragraph!). Now while I get that the author was trying to bond with the reader with these little asides, they just were too many that they became distracting. Those bits of text could have been handled more directly (and the parenthesis could have been saved for more effective use).<br /><br />Not sure if I'd recommend this book to others. Its part of a series and wasn't horrible so I'll probably wait until I read book 2 before making any final judgments.<br /><br />In Short: Not a bad start to a series but not overly memorable either. There was a little too much preaching going on to make Zoey a believable teenage girl. While I will check out book 2, I'm not sure if I'll continue too far into the series.<br /><br />As originally posted on my blog Ticket to Anywheream sure will continue throughout most of the series.

0307744434|5|\\"It is not only about what you call magic. [...] It is more than that. Everything you do, every moment of the day and night is a move. You carry your chessboard with you, it is not contained within canvas and stripes. Though you and your opponent do not have the luxury of polite squares to stay upon.\\"<br /><br />Welcome to Le Cirque de Rêves. Are you ready for a game of true magic?<br /><br />The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is the story of Celia and Marco, chosen when they were children to be part of a game that would test their magical abilities and push them to their limits. Selected as they were by their paternal figures, they had no say of their own, making them not only players but pawns. Neither child knew the identity of their competitor, initially, but as they grow older, their paths cross, and the stakes are raised when one recognizes the other's abilities and their stories intertwine.<br /><br />It is said that this game has gone for some time, each time with two competitors, but the rules are never stated and the forum is the world at large. This is the world we know - the average person lives an average life troubled by gravity, responsibility, and other people - as opposed to a wholly supernatural world. (Or is it?) The talents these people possess are unknown to the general populace, and they walk amongst us with ease. For example, Celia becomes an illusionist at the circus, where people are blown away by her tricks, not knowing they are real, not knowing that she actually is transmogrifying objects.<br /><br />This particular round of competition book begins in New York in 1873, when a five-year-old girl with an envelope pinned to her coat arrives at a theater:<br /><br />The theater manager does not need to read the envelope to know who the girl is for. The bright eyes peering out from under a cloud of unruly brown curls are smaller, wider versions of the magician's own.<br /><br />This is Celia. Her mother has taken her own life, and the envelope contains her suicide note. The magician, Prospero, aka Hector Brown, immediately recognizes her abilities. Within months, he has contacted another man, volunteering his daughter without her consent or understanding and setting the new game in motion.<br /><br />Elsewhere, a boy is adopted, his mysterious caretaker picking him out to be the other player. Soon, the boy's fingers are covered in ink as he fills journals with words and symbols and reads all of the books he can get his stained hands on. This is Marco.<br /><br />Neither of them recite spells. Neither of them invoke names of gods and goddesses. Their powers are typically contained and controlled by their minds, put into action with a flick of the wrist or no movement at all, just a thought, just a suggestion, just a desire.<br /><br />Then Le Cirque de Rêves - The Night Circus - is created. This unique collection of tents presents attendees with performers and sights to see set in black and white, stark contrasts and amazing feats illuminated by bright white fire. Each tent has a different performer or theme: a contortionist, a tarot card reader, the cat-tamers. Many of the tents have things one can't experience in daily life, imaginative, sensory, and mystifying things which often seem to exceed the limits of the tent walls, allowing people to explore labyrinths and walk on clouds, to relive personal memories and revisit their pasts, to release their sorrows and lighten their burdens. Marco is an assistant to the creator of the circus; Celia is hired as an illusionist.<br /><br />As the game plays out, the story deepens. Pay close attention to the date and location placed beside each chapter title to stay oriented. Time travel is never an element of the story, but the chapters do oscillate between the late 1800s and the early 1900s, with the anticipation increasing as the two paths become closer and closer on the timeline. In addition to Celia, Marco, and their paternal puppeteers, important characters include a clockmaker, an architect-engineer, a retired prima ballerina, two chatty sisters, a boy who yearns to escape the trappings of his family life, and a pair of young twins with paranormal abilities. I really liked Poppet and Widget, the twins who were born the night the circus begins. I also thought the twist on the ghost character was inventive. As the circus moves from town to town and time marches on, alliances are won and lost as truths are revealed or concealed. It's a very intriguing story, and everything builds to the finishing moves in the game.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me, and now I am recommending it as well. I enjoy stories with empowered characters, be they magically empowered and/or strong of mind. Celia and Marco's abilities are quite different, yet complimentary. Celia's illusions often appear effortless - a shake of her head changes her hair color, a la The Craft; her birds morph from paper to winged and in flight and back to paper - but when considering what her father did to her to strengthen her abilities, one realizes the price she's paid to live this life, far before the ultimate conclusion. Morgenstern's writing is never more lovely than when a character is telling a story, especially the chapter entitled The Wizard in the Tree.<br /><br />If you like stories with magic of this sort - powers of the mind projected, made into reality, or breathtaking illusions - then you should definitely pick up this book. It could be and has been compared to Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, but I greatly prefer The Night Circus. If only Morgenstern's name was Gorgenstern, then this book would be shelved next to Christopher Golden's books, making that shelf of fantasy novels even more fantastic. (I wonder what would happen if Tsukiko from The Night Circus met Kitsune from The Veil trilogy...)<br /><br />\\"Someone needs to tell those tales.\\"<br /><br />Oh, and I have a message for Poppet and Widget: If you ever need a sitter for the kittens, I'm available.rs include a clockmaker, an architect-engineer, a retired prima ballerina, two chatty sisters, a boy who yearns to escape the trappings of his family life, and a pair of young twins with paranormal abilities.

B006LSZECO|3|I had no idea it would end the way it did it was an intense book and I'm still going thru things in my own mind about the book
B007PT3QOQ|4|fun game, but I dislike having to pay for all the extras. would rather pay up front than every time I need to complete an action.
B0049P1ZZQ|5|I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM SOME ARE HAVING WITH EPISODE 2, \\"GUTS.\\" IT APPEARS THAT SOME ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE ENTIRE FOOTAGE (3+ MINUTES OR SO) CONCERNING THE GROUPS TAKING INDOORS \\"WAYNE DULAP\\", THE DEAD, WALKER. THIS FOOTAGE OF GORE AS THE GROUP HACKS AWAY AT HIM WITH AN AXE IN GRAPHIC DETAIL. I TOO HAVE SEEN THIS DELETION. BUT, YOU CAN SEE IT ALL! A SIMPLE CHANGE AS TO HOW YOU BEGIN WATCHING THE FIRST DISC IS KEY. SIMPLY VIEW EACH EPISODE AS A SINGLE EPISODE IN ITSELF. RATHER THAN CLICKING \\"PLAY ALL.\\" TO VIEW EACH EPISODE AS A SINGLE PLAY, YOU WILL SEE EVERY FRAME OF INTENDED GORE AND BLOOD! OR AS REAL AS IT WAS INTENDED! I HOPE THIS CLEARS THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF \\"MISSING FOOTAGE.\\"<br /> As a Verified Amazon Purchased item, I can attest to this with my honesty and heart. Growing up on the original \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", that movie scared me for years. To this day, it still sends shivers down my spine. In fact, the only thing that truly gets my heart pounding in fright, is the dead coming back to life! For decades hundreds of movies have imitated, but never duplicated that 1968 low-budget film. One man's view took others with him and the select few became giants in the industry in their own right. Tom Savini was Romero's make-up & special effects artist on NOTLD and he branched off to make the dead more real in his views. Another man, Greg Nicottero, followed Savini, and in time, along with Howard Berger, became the predominant forces when it came to bringing the dead to life. Fast forward to 2010.<br />When I heard whispers at Horror Conventions that the Graphic Novel I loved, \\"The Walking Dead\\" would be picked up by AMC for a single, 6 episode season, I knew my dreams of NOTLD had come full circle. Having met Mr. Romero on several occasions, I had asked him of his thoughts on the TV jump? He just said, \\"If anyone can pull this off, Greg can.\\" That was golden for me. But how does one take a comic of sorts and turn it into a TV series?<br />AMC gave the go-ahead for an unprecedented attempt to where TV had not gone before. No different than Star Trek and the realms it charted. Wow. Was I shocked and happily worth the 50 year wait!<br />Robert Kirkman's take on the \\"Undead\\" was and is breathtaking. While there are certain differences between the Graphic Novel & TV show, some subtle, others much more outright, \\"The Walking Dead Season 1\\" was absolutely brilliant! Sure, the first episode mirrors \\"28 Days Later\\" as Rick Grimes awakes from a coma to find the world has turned upside down, he remains true to his Sheriff's law abiding ways. As well as a man seeking his wife and son. Only to find every BODY he passes is either \\"put down\\" or NOT! As he arrives to his home, his life, you see what I believe any of us would do. Collapse. He breaks down as he realizes that all he knew is no more, but with a grip on \\"maybe?\\" He patrols outdoors to his former neighbors home. Only to be whacked with a shovel by an even more scared Duane. Only a child himself trying to deal with DEAD PEOPLE NOT STAYING DEAD! As Rick regains his wits for a sec, he sees Morgan with a muzzle in his face. Wait? Isn't Rick the Sheriff? No wonder he passes out! We as the audience do not need the growing ensemble cast yet. Rick needs to learn about the new reality first, first hand. The brief cut-aways at his prior gun shot are necessary for US to learn about him. Rick learns of the world from Morgan and Duane. All the while Morgans pathetic wife mopes just outside because Morgan himself still hasn't come to terms yet. And he is 1 month into this insanity!<br />All in this first episode, the 3 members must deal with this together. Yet prepare to go separate ways. An amazing moment when Morgan has his new rifle that Rick gave him. One full month on of his morbid wife lurking outside the front door, and the Human Element keeps him from putting her down. He knows she is dead. It is the right thing to do. But the LOVE keeps him from pullingthat trigger. Duane knows the moment is near and covers his ears and cringes with fright! Morgan hesitates. He is not ready to deal with the \\"Walking Dead.\\" Fore his wife is not his wife anymore. Given the chance, she would tear into his flesh in a sec! Rick drives off in a Sheriff's car in search of Lori and Carl. He KNOWS they made it. He hangs onto this simple yet strong notion. If not, then all hope is truly lost! All in the first episode!<br />I shall not go on about the remaining 5 episodes of Season 1. By now, I'm sure most of you have either seen them or know about them. Many on here have written much as I. Yes, some hate the premise of Zombies altogether. I say to them, just don't watch, don't read this and change the channel. As Bruce Springstien sang, \\"500 channels and nothing to watch.\\" I'm sure there is. As for myself and Millions of loyal Undead fans, THIS is exactly what we have been waiting for.<br />All thanks to George A. Romero and his original vision of \\"NIGHT OF THE FLESH EATERS.\\" I'm so glad that name never took!<br />I am highly recommending this set in Blu-Ray! To watch this in the best possible clarity and sound is like nothing else! I have also purchased \\"The Walking Dead Seasons 2&3\\" on Blu-Ray as well. I shall be leaving follow-up reviews for them as well. By far, aside from the original \\"Star Trek Series\\", AMC's \\"The Walking Dead\\" is the BEST thing on cable television...

B0063IH60K|5|Good alone time game to play.  Keeps me focused and using my mind.  Have played this game as a child and still love it.
B005XN31LY|5|Once I started watching the series, I wanted to keep going to the next one. Originally, I thought it would be juvenile. One of my students requested that I view and I was not disappointed.  Very clever in how fairy tales are utilized. I would like to finish season one as soon as possible. How I wish it did not cost me money :)
B0000024W3|5|Some might say that roots of this enigmatic record can be traced back to Bob Dylans days in Big Pink with the Band but in actuality some of these recordings can be traced back to a younger dylan and a younger america.  What appears to be a haphazzard mismtach of covers, originals and live  material is more of a juxtaposition of the many voices of Dylan and his  musical asthetic; and by this juxtaoposition we have the creation of the  self-portrait. Most of the cover material on this record is drawn from the  annals of forgoten pre-war american folk music; Dylans selections from this  era are, in some cases, the only surviving recordings of this songs. The  live material on this record represnt some of Dylan's most comercially  succeful  songs reworked within the dynamic of the mid 60's. These versions  are not, by any means, the cleanest, in-key, well recored surviving  versions of these songs but what they illustrate is the incredable  interplay that Dylan had created within his band at the time. Functioning  as a single unit rather than a group of indiviuals the interplay between  Dylan and Band was the realization of visions early sixties of the rock and  roll band. The remaining  tracks fill out with new studio versions of some  older obscured dylan tunes, some new originals and a few more covers from  the Golden age of Rock and roll and a then contemporary folk favorite;  Simon and garfunkles The Boxer (which serves a point of referance for  dylans abandoned role as teh folk Singer). the rest of the material finds  Dylan in various modes which, for the most part, existed only on coveted  bootleged records; Dylan as country western music, Dylan as Woddy Guthrie,  Dylan as Johnny Cash; Dyaln As Lee Hazlewood, Dylan as Dylan. This record  in my oppion, was Dylan most sincere and ambitious work of art in his post  Blonde on Blonde days. In each song is found a subtlty of Dylans musical  asthetic  which is  brought  fto the surface; this record is a must have  not only for dylan affecianados but for anyone who considers themselves a  lover of American music.
0804171475|5|I really enjoyed my read through this book.<br /><br />The book can be divided into a few acts that are not necessarily chronological, but which adds greatly to the overall flow of the book and the development of the characters. I found the first act containing the love story surrounding the main character to be rather droll but it did set the tone for the main character. The act that depicted the survival of the Australian POWs in the Japanese camp was absolutely gripping and my favourite part of the book. It is in this hell that we see the evolution of our main character and the others around him. The focus is never solely on on character--it constantly shifts between characters thereby providing us with a myriad of different perspectives. This, I felt, allowed me to connect with each and every character thereby making me incapable of hating some of the more unlikable characters--characters I thought I would.<br /><br />Richard Flanagan shines the spotlight brightly on these incredibly real, deep, and raw characters--and the effects of the war on all of them. To me, the story was journey into the mind-caverns of these characters and how these mind is scarred, twisted, and damaged from the events. I found, at the end of this sad journey, that there were no heroes or villains; no great battle between good and evil. I found that those who remained were survivors of an experience that ravaged them completely and utterly. Their attempts to &#34;decipher an indecipherable world&#34; provide the perfect culmination to the book. Some find peace and others naught. What the reader finds is anyone's guess.

B003L8EX0G|4|It's safe to say that the future of vocal jazz is safe in the hands of young artist like Ms. Yanofsky. She has chosen to learn from the best (Ella, Sarah and June) but has added her own youthful entusiasm and \\"spin\\" to well-known \\"classic\\" pop music. Her scatting is impeccable and she brings a very nice maturity to her singing. Definitely well worth checking out and keeping an eye on in the future.

B000002H97|4|Metallica didnt sellout. This Metallica's Heavy Metal stage. All the albums after this are Hard/Modern Rock and THATS when they sold out. The only reason this got 4 stars from me is because it DOES stray away from the original thrashiness that was Metallica. Still a solid Metal album though. Buy it, along with Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and . . .And Just For All.

0316204366|5|This is the kind of writing that changes you, makes you smarter, more empathetic, more interested in the people and situations  around you.  This is the kind of writing that gives you hope that your own Goliath battles can be won.<br />Don't be discouraged with the first two chapters; they move you into the rest of the stunning book and it is so worthwhile.<br />Line after line---like &#34;We are all of us not merely liable to fear, we are also prone to be afraid of being afraid&#34;  and &#34;But we need to remember that our definition of what is right is, as often as not, simply the way that people in positions of privilege close the door on those on the outside&#34; and chapter after chapter---like Emil &#34;Jay&#34; Freireich and Wyatt Walker---you will be so glad you read this book.  And so glad Malcolm Gladwell wrote this remarkable book and shared it with you.

B000002KBU|5|Previously the only I had really known about Joni Mitchell was the fact that Counting Crows & Vanessa Carlton had covered one of her songs by the name of \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" and she had written a song called \\"Both Sides Now\\", that was it, I had really never listened to any of her music and that's why I loved this album so much, because it sounded so innovative and beautiful. This album is regarded as her masterpiece, and so it should be, it's amazing, upon first listen you are immediately drawn in.<br /><br />Although only about 36 minutes in length, \\"Blue\\" is well worth the stress of hunting down and buying, most good record stores should have this album. The songs focus on an emotional, up-front approach with the lyrics and sparse, minimalistic instrumentation. Joni's voice is unlike anything I've heard before, it can be tender, deep, soft and loving yet it can be powerful and show and amazing range. Some suggest that her unique vocal texture is the fact that she has been smoking since she was nine.<br /><br />The album starts with the superb song, \\"All I Want\\". Joni's voice is really warm and welcoming and I love the crescendo's in this song. The instrumentation fits the song perfectly, without a doubt this song is the best song on the album.<br /><br />\\"My Old Man\\" sees Joni adopt a Tori Amos like approach to the song, even though this album was released at least 15 years before Tori's debut!! I love the lyrics and Joni's vocal range.<br /><br />\\"Little Green\\" is the oldest song on the album, written in 1967, this song is the most folk influenced song on the album, showing remnants of her early days. The next song, \\"Carey\\" still sounds fresh and innovative some 30 years after it was released. I like the vocal harmonies and imagery created with the lyrics.<br /><br />The title track is a stunning, hauntingly beautiful ballad that is sparse yet sounding like an epic. The piano is just so heavenly and played to perfection. \\"California\\" is basically an ode to California, nothing simpler!! Even though she is from Canada is seems like she is singing about her homeland. I love the guitars, again.<br /><br />The eerie, almost at times melancholic \\"This Flight Tonight\\" is another track that sounds so modern and has obviously stood the test time. Her confessional lyrics give us an insight into Joni herself. \\"River\\" at first sounds like a bizzare re-working of a Christmas carol, even though it is themed around the season of giving it isn't all \\"Joy to world.... fa la la la la\\" it's more of a self-analysis of herself than anything else, simply using a river as a symbol.<br /><br />\\"A Case Of You\\" has great lyrics and I really like the symbolism of Joni's love for someone being symbolised through alcohol, how she talks about drinking a case of someone, pure genius. \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\" is a great way to end such a great album, with it's haunting piano opening you know it's going to be a great song. The way she talks about the past is great and clear.<br /><br />Overall, this album is a superb find for me and I am totally overwhelmed. Many people call it melancholy the whole way through but I differ, I hear lots of reconciliation and plenty of happiness. I now plan to explore Joni's music further, with expected purchases of \\"Court & Spark\\" and \\"The Hissing Of The Summer Lawns\\". I highly recommend this album to anyone wanting to hear some really good music and indulge in a true masterpiece.ornia, nothing simpler!!

0060005696|5|Great book, soon as I got it I sat and read for hours, tons of great practical and real world knowledge that I think just about if not everybody can or could as some point in time relate to. For someone who never really was a big reading fan this is defininately a book that I would read more than once and enjoy it at that.

B002KAJ0AO|5|than previous BSB efforts \\"Never Gone\\" and \\"Unbreakable\\" in particular.  But after getting past that and that the cd is only 11 songs long.  I feel they could've added another song or two to round this cd out.  But the songs that are on here upbeat efforts like the first single \\"Straight Through My Heart\\", \\"Masquerade\\", and \\"Bye Bye Love\\" are more akin to stuff that they've done in the past efforts.  However they are still all good songs and could be heard on your standard Top 40 radio stations.  While other efforts like \\"This Is Us\\", \\"Bigger\\" and \\"Shattered\\" you might find on your A/C radio stations.  I really love the last track \\"Undone\\" as it's more of a slower track for the cd and it ends \\"This Is Us\\" rather well.<br /><br />BSB is notably absent from the co-writing process on \\"This Is Us\\" minus two or three songs.  But again despite that the producers/writers that handle the bulk of the cd.  Do a very solid job of getting them out of their comfort zone and doing new things for them on this one.  Overall, their latest effort might not go down great with folks that are comparing it to their previous works.  I try not to do that as artist tend slightly change their sound from cd to cd.  I've listened to it several times and am pleased with this one overall.  I'm glad BSB is back doing it for us all over again.

B000FCJZUO|2|I wished I would have researched this more before I bought it, if I would have known the entire book was in email format I would have not wasted my time. Alas, wasted my time I did. Reading the description I thought that this would be a really great but easy read. The format left so much to be desired. Because the entire story in in email format I feel like you miss out on 70% of the story. It drags on and on, and the plot leaves a lot to be desired as well. Take my advice and skip this one.
B007BVOEPI|4|Brutal, harsh, gritty, graphic, violent, sexual violence.<br /><br />I realize that the author of the books and the producers of the show put the sexual violence there because it's a matter of harsh reality that where there are males and females, there is sexual violence. Still, lost a star for sexual violence due to how strongly I feel about the subject. Wish it wasn't part of the books or the show.<br /><br />Same as the other seasons. As true to the books as can be.<br /><br />Love the costumes, the locations, Peter Dinklage (as Tyrion Lanister), and Gwendolyn Christie (as Brienne of Tarth).

0446563048|4|Delivering Happiness is Tony Hsieh's account of how Zappos became the highly valued and much admired company of today. It is basically a biography of the company, with Tony there for every moment of the often turbulent ride.<br /><br />The best part of this book is how replete it is with stories about employees, vendors, customers, and the investor (Amazon.com) who bought Zappos in 2009. These stories are inspirational and informative, adding yet more color to the already vibrant story Tony tells.<br /><br />In all, this book does a great job of recounting the human side of a currently popular business. It's a fun and interesting read.
1408803011|5|This book is a bit self-conscious. It isn't narrative, per se, but a self-conscious traipsing through the Harry Potter series. It is a bit patronizing to the reader.

B0015XHP4K|5|Rambo Box Set consists three Rambo films - First Blood,Rambo:First Blood Part II and Rambo III - that was based on David Morrell's novel's First Blood character,John Rambo,who was a troubled Vietnam War veteran and a former Green Beret who has many military skills particularly in aspects of survival,weaponry,combat and warfare.<br /><br />First Blood involves the story wherein John Rambo becomes a country drifter for the last 10 years as he had difficulty adjusting to civilian life due to the psychological ill-effects he got during the Vietnam War.Then he got involved law enforcement and authorities in a particular town that led him to become violent.As for Rambo:First Blood Part II,it involves the story wherein Rambo is taken from prison and was asked to rescue American POW's from Vietnam.Meanwhile,we get to see Rambo becomes involved in the Afghan War to save his Colonel Trautman in Rambo III.Overall, this is a great collector's set for people who are Rambo fans.

1451695195|5|I ordered this book a while before realizing what was going on with my father....not knowing how ill he was.  The other day he passed....WWII and survivor of Normandy.  Although I have always been a person of faith, having this book now has made his loss so much easier for me.  I was meant to get it when I did to help me get through the grieving process.  Wonderful book!  Thank you!

B00004Y6NP|5|What can you say about a band that has the courage to play almost exclusively its own music and then make it sound like you have heard it a million times before.  This is one of the true \\"classics\\" of our times and this remastering of the original has produced for the listener an even greater enjoyment and awareness of the sublime musicianship of this band.  If you like Dire Straits and even if you have the original do your self a favour and give this a listen on some decent equipment.  I cannot stop playing it again.
B001AFF25W|5|After I read this book, I already have changed! It was very good book indeed. EASY to read!<br />Totally different from the regular books that I tend not to finish after reading a few pages.

0385340559|5|There are many reasons to admire Jack Reacher, the taciturn hero of Lee Child's \\"Bad Luck and Trouble.\\" He is a low-maintenance individual who travels with just his passport, ATM card, and toothbrush. He is incredibly strong and an expert in weaponry and hand-to-hand combat, and will go out of his way to protect the people he likes and respects.  Reacher is also intelligent, intuitive, and creative; by thinking out of the box, he usually finds the answers to whatever questions are puzzling him.<br /><br />In \\"Bad Luck and Trouble,\\" Reacher has a reunion of sorts with three of his buddies from the army,  Frances Neagley, Karla Dixon, and David O'Donnell.  They reunite because of a tragic event:  Calvin Franz, who worked with them years ago in the military police, was thrown out of a helicopter in the California desert after suffering unspeakable torture.  The victim left behind a wife and little boy.  Three other MPs from the same special investigations unit, Jorge Sanchez, Tony Swan, and Manuel Orozco, have disappeared, as well.  Reacher and his remaining ex-colleagues band together to find out what happened to these men and why.  He is also plotting revenge:  \\"There are dead men walking, as of right now.  You don't throw my friends out of helicopters and live to tell the tale.\\"  The slogan that Reacher and the others live by is: \\"You do not mess with the special investigators.\\"<br /><br />Lee Child's Reacher is a modern day cowboy, who generally travels alone from town to town, minding his own business.  Yet, somehow, \\"bad luck and trouble\\" always manage to find him.  This time, in a refreshing variation on Child's usual formula, Reacher takes his place as the commanding officer of a tightly knit and focused team, each member making his or her own invaluable contribution to the investigation.  Neagley is smart and tough, and she has plenty of money to bankroll their operation.  Dixon is a forensic accountant with a sharp mathematical mind, equal to Reacher's.  O'Donnell is fast, powerful, and fearless.  This formidable foursome is pitted against a group of ruthless adversaries who always seem to be one step ahead of them.<br /><br />Child has created a cadre of well-drawn heroes, and the fast-paced action never flags.  The terse, often dryly humorous dialogue is enormously entertaining.  In addition, some nifty mental puzzles are thrown in to challenge the investigators' powers of deduction; brawn without brains just doesn't cut it in today's world.  On the downside, the villains are one-dimensional and the finale is a bit too pat to be believed, even in a fantasy such as this.  Still, this novel is great escapist fun; it will have wide audience appeal among long-time Reacher aficionados, and it will probably earn the author a host of new fans, as well.O'Donnell is fast, powerful, and fearless.

B00IK590UI|1|Terrible remake of the 1982 original film by the same name.  The original is a classic, whereas this one is completely forgettable.  Don't watch this one.  Go watch the 1982 one.
B004SUDQ8Q|5|Rabbit Proof Fence is a heartbreaking story based upon a govt policy that lasted for generations (until 1970?) and forced families to give up their children. This powerful story reveals a native people that deserve all of our collective respect for the sheer determination to stay a free people.A must watch film.

B004EBT5CU|5|Love the CD! My first one from Adele and now I'm a fan for sure! What a fresh raw haunting voice, especially on Rolling in the Deep. This woman sings like she has suffered in love/life and experienced a little taste of sweet revenge along the way and her song's emotions reflect this journey ... you will not be disappointed!
B00BP4WAZS|5|excellent movie great for kids and grown ups alike!
B004SBS8LA|1|Almost halfway thru May. When can we expect the update?????? I cant wait! Pkease release soon or give an estimated time of arrival for us!
B0013LPS8Y|3|Although Disc1 is certainly a sonic improvement over the rather muddy original CD release, it does up the loudness level a bit (A common effect on CD's in the last decade).  Some songs like \\"Surrender\\" are actually close to or are actually clipping in certain areas, which is a real shame. I'm also confused as to why the longer versions of \\"Seconds\\", \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Like a Song\\" weren't used in the re-mastering effort.<br /><br />But Disc2 is where my confusion really starts to sink in.  Many songs have been available as import CD Singles or B-sides and it's nice to have them all together on one CD.  And \\"Angels Too Tied To the Ground\\" is a new song for this very long U2 fan, so that was a very nice surprise.  However, they should have never added the newer New Year's Day mixes - they don't belong there!  If those were dropped, the CD would have been about 45 minutes long and they could have included other missing gems like the \\"Be There\\" demo plus the demos of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"Like a Song\\", \\"Surrender\\" and \\"THBAO\\".<br /><br />6/2011 EDIT:  Since this first review, I've found more tools to access dynamic range (excellent tool called \\"Dynamic Range Meter\\").  I checked DISC1 of this re-master, and it received an overall score of \\"9\\" (fair).  The MSFL CD received a score of \\"11\\" (which is better).  This gels with what I saw with Audacity and also my own ears, back in 2008.

B0080SZ0V8|4|I got this as the FAOTD, but now know it would be worth the money.  There are aspects of the game I don't like, but it has such a mix, there's something to appeal to everyone.  I'm still not finished with the game.  Pros:  Love the scenes and the more &#34;cerebral&#34; puzzles.  Cons:  Hate the arcade-like games and think some of them are simply too long -- like the squares one (board should be half that size OR stealing should not be allowed) and the later equation game.  As others have suggested, save the orbs (?) for games you truly hate or can't get.  Also, the items list sometimes says that two things aren't used together, when in fact they are.  Try switching the drag order when you're pretty sure they go together.  (I had to find this out via walk-throughs.)

0964385619|1|The author states that time is your most valuable asset and I feel indignant that he wasted mine.  He states a few common sense points about wealth accumulation and spends the rest of the time boasting of his wealth  and suggesting HIGHLY speculative investments for his readers.  I think the  man was just lucky and would certainly NOT advocate following his advice on  buying penny stocks.

B0067AC5KA|4|It's taken me a few months decide how I should write a review of these books.  Here goes nothing...<br /><br />As for the positives:<br /><br />Loved, loved, loved the first two books.  Admittedly, it took a bit of pushing before I really got my footing in the first book; once about 15% in, I couldn't put it down.  The plot was all over the place, in a really good way.  I really didn't know which way things were coming.  Some things were predictible, some things totally blindsided me.  I loved the characters, even the ones I hated! It really mattered what happened. After I finished the first book, I couldn't start the second one fast enough.  And the same as book 1, I couldn't put book 2 down.  The books were different but both very good in their own respect.  So of course, upon completing book 2, I immediately began book 3.  Then wham!!  I hit a brick wall.  The few mild annoyances from books 1 and 2 that I overlooked because the plot was so engaging, became huge distractions in book 3 because the plot was... well, I don't know where it went.  All I was left with were distractions.<br /><br />So as for the negatives:<br /><br />As has already been stated about a gazillion times, Swedes must love their coffee and sandwiches.  A couple of the other reviews have even listed the number of times coffee and sandwiches were mentioned all total.  To discuss it in a review may seem petty -- but when I was unable to find the plot of book 3, I was left to consider all of the sandwiches and coffee.  And really, who eats a sandwich with coffee three times a day?  Was something lost in translation?  I mean, I like sandwiches.  I like coffee.  But together for every meal?  I'm not sure about that.  And if you found this little op ed about sandwiches and coffee to be a bit ridiculous and distracting from the rest of the review -- exactly my point.<br /><br />And the names.  Oh, the names.  By the third book, there were more characters mentioned than I could ever begin (or want) tokeep track of.  Complicating this matter further is that everyone's name is Swedish which 1) are unfamiliar names, thus difficult to remember, 2) many of the names sound very much alike, 3) many of the names are mentioned once then never brought up again.  Again, for a book without an interesting plot, the names became a distraction.<br /><br />The first and second books were great.  I couldn't wait for every opportunity to pick up my Kindle.  Very shortly into the third book, I knew there was a major problem.  The plot was uninteresting or maybe even non-existent.  It left me completely distracted with what were minor issues in the first and second books.  All told, in book 3, it was just too much work.  And it didn't take me long to realize I just really didn't care.  Too bad.<br /><br />Four stars because the first two books were really that good.  Just don't feel like you have to read book 3 for your life to be complete.  Skipping it is highly recommended.
6305428042|5|Amazing movie! I have watched this movie since I was a kid and I love it, I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
B00BMVTS1S|1|I want to be clear that this is a review of the Instant Video product and not the content of the movie. I originally saw the movie in a theater and, although it is over-long and does not adhere to Tolkien's novel, it was entertaining. I wanted to watch it again before seeing the second installment in a theater recently.<br /><br />The problem is this: There is apparently a known issue with this product and Sony Bravia TV's. The disclaimer was not displayed, to my knowledge, before I had purchased the product and attempted to play it on my Bravia television. The initial selection screen, which displays information about the movie and from which the user can select to &#34;play&#34;, &#34;resume&#34;, etc., included a disclaimer that said it may not work correctly on Bravia televisions and that they are &#34;working to resolve the issue&#34;.<br /><br />Having already purchased the product, I tried to view it. The movie played for about 30 minutes without issue, then it popped up and &#34;content error&#34; message. I selected &#34;Retry&#34; and it played for a few seconds before displaying the error message again. I tried this 4-5 times then gave up. I later tried selecting the movie to &#34;Resume&#34; play. It immediately displayed the error message again.<br /><br />If you have a Sony Bravia television, steer clear of this product. I paid for it and cannot play it on my TV. I have also not found a way to return the product to get my money back.<br /><br />I have had great experiences with Amazon's Instant Video up until now.  However, I am very dissatisfied with this purchase.

B00005214X|5|George Harrison's masterpiece is given new life with bonus tracks and liner notes from Harrison himself in this new release. Originally composed of new songs and Beatles session leftovers (including the title track), this collection showcases Harrison's soft voice and slide guitar playing along with an all-star cast. All Things Must Pass is a treasure chest of some of Harrison's best songs including &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot;, &quot;What is Life&quot;, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;. Produced by Phil Spector, this album features a big sound at times and quiet moments accompanied by stings. Five spirited Apple jam sessions are featured at the end of the album with Dave Mason and Eric Clapton joining Harrison on guitars.

B00957T6X6|2|Good start and then degenerates into a series of disconnected episodes with no ending.<br /><br />Just tedious ofter the third volume. Gets tired and too episodic, and looses the plot.<br /><br />A good novel has a theme, development and recapitulation orending. Novels-for-TV become laborious and tedious.

B00PEJG1K0|5|Fantastic!!!  Who would ever have thought that Blues and Manson went together??  Granted, they aren't your 'standard old black guy singing the blues with his beat up guitar' sort, but its really well done in this Manson/Blues unique style.  I LOVED the acoustic additions to the deluxe edition - do yourself a favor and pony up 2-3 extra bucks for it - turns out Manson can hum along to acoustic music rather beautifully.........

B005LAIIRQ|5|SPOILER<br /><br />If you come at this expecting the story about wolves to be \\"real\\" wolves, you'd probably hate it.  But the wolves are obvious symbols of death.<br /><br />It was a very emotional movie, starting with a near suicide - prevented by the howl of a wolf... and then the accident.  To me it was a story of the wolves saving the men - ironically by \\"taking them\\" - similar to Jacob's LAdder's reference to \\"Demon's appear as demons taking our attachments from us.\\"  In one killing we see how the wolf really is a man's dead daughter, who appears to him, but the others see it as a viscious wolf taking his life.<br /><br />I saw the movie as the men were already dead... and the wolves were symbols of the last step to cross over.  It's scary. It's terrifying.  But that's only the fear of loss.  There is really rest, and it's the loved ones who are coming to take the individuals through the process... which is why the main character of Liam is taken by the Alpha wolf... and none of the others.  Possibly his wife, or father, come to help him move over.<br /><br />He just couldn't see it... so he saw the wolves as icons of the end, of enemies.<br /><br />The wolves wanted him to learn to live life, and face death fighting (not giving up) - just like the poem he often quoted throughout the movie... which is why they stopped the suicide... and yet, they brought him to the end.
B00H83EUQW|4|good movie...arrived intact...no complaints
B005LAII08|3|Pixar man, they sort of missed the magic mark with this one.  It reminded me too much of a difficult teenager learning what's important in life...with emphasis on &#34;difficult teenager&#34;...who wants to watch that!
B005R32L66|2|I can see people but they can't see me
B0007TKNII|5|Given to my BFF because she loved it and couldn't find her copy and is in poor health.
B0000AQS0F|5|This is simply one of the best shows ever put on TV. The dialouge and character interaction is only matched on the first few seasons of The West Wing. FOX triumphed in hamstringing the show and not giving it any chance of working. The DVD set is great, all the episodes are in wide screen and it feels like watching movie after movie. The special features are great, especially Joss Whedon's comments during many of the episodes. A must own for anyone who is a fan of things that don't suck. Also, buy it to get pumped for the movie based on the show titled &quot;Serenity.&quot; The movie starts filming in June 2004 and should be out summer 2005.
B00A196SE2|5|love it
B000ICM5MG|5|Hello Folks,  I want to thank MGM  for this release....they really got it right!  first off...  all the excellent bonus features from the 25th Anniversary edition..  the 30 minute on camera commentary by Stallone, the tributes to Burgess Meredith, the cinematographer James Crabbe and Bill Conti..ALL made it to this edition...which means you don't have to hold onto older inferior editions to have all the bonus features...and this IS a big deal.  Too many recent DVD editions of movies lose old features which make keeping mutliple copies essential and that stinks.  The extra features are really too  many to list...multiple commentaries..and the Stallone alone is worth the update...its truly like watching the movie with him  in  the room...WOW!  all the past trailers...the appearance on  the Dinah Shore show..featurettes...this is a NO BRAINER for fans of the movie.    The three part \\"making of\\" which runs about an hour and half and  features the main players is extraordinary in its revelations about the movie and the craft of making movies and WHY this was a million to one chance and WHY their lack of budget actually helped  in  many ways.  The twenty minute documentary on the Steadicam and its inventor ...who filmed his demo on the art museum steps before heading to Hollywood....its just proof that all the planets lined up for this one!  For those out there bitching about the upgraded releases of DVDs...don't buy em...for those of us who love the movies...these higher quality releases are very welcome.  I  picked this 2 disc set up for $15 at Target...and there are hours of features...WHAT A DEAL!    If you love the movie...get this version.  if you don't care about bonus features...stick with your old copy.
B00CATSONE|2|The book is a quick biography of the greatest mind Nikola Tesla. Interesting and a good read to spend some of your ores oops time on

B00BMT9SQA|3|Was a great movie, funny, sad and all ..truly enjoyed watching it. Might watch it again with my bf he wanted to see it .
1400052181|5|What an amazing book.  Ms. Skloot obviously put a large chuck of her life and her heart in the book.  I work in health care and have not looked at my work or my patients the same since reading this and I am striving to be sure I never do.  Thank you Rebecca Skloot and all the people that helped her write this book, particularly the family of Henrietta Lacks.
B00005JL3A|5|5 Stars for the comments of JT and that guy from NY, expecially for his note about the tube ... :-)))
B0076DCT2G|4|I loved the way Mr. DeMille ended or really did not end the book. Just wondering if he can create the way John Corey and Paul Brenner get even with Buck and Chet. Can't wait to read his next. Loved Plum Island too which is for sale....Thanks, Joe
0307341577|5|This was the first book that I have ever read by Gillian Flynn and let me tell you I am hooked. I love her writing and I can't wait to read everything that she has written and is planning to write!<br /><br />From the moment I started reading the very first page of this book, I couldn't put it down. Libby's deranged description of herself drew me in and immediately had me wanting more. I loved the author's wicked sense of humor as well as the detail in which she provided throughout the story. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the twist and turns that I was taken on as I was reading as well as the fact that the ending wasn't easy to figure out after only a few chapters into the book. All in all its a great book and I definitely would recommend!
B00FAPF5U0|5|I'm glad the game puts a time limit on obtaining new lives. Otherwise I might never stop playing.  There's luck and strategy involved and it's always fun to see what clever twists might occur on the next level.
B00BG5CXGM|5|I love the case and feel. Not the best thing for safety though. I'm clumsy so I use this one for when I am at my job. Not gonna drop it. Hopefuly
B008Y212PI|4|Fun to do.  The only thing that I think would make it better would be to have different puzzles for the different size grids, instead of having to do the same ones again if you want to do all the size grids.

0446310786|5|Around 1962, when I was a little kid, my aunt read this book.  I saw the title and (in the self-righteous way only the very young have) pointed out how awful it was to have a book about killing mockingbirds.  I believe she commented that the book made that very point.    Ten years later I read the book myself.  And have done so several times since.  Once I read it while I was traveling in Germany, and was touched all the more since it is such a quintessentially American book.  A striking juxtaposition to read about the rural south of the 1930's while staying in the modern Berlin of the 1990's.    I grew up in the middle of California's San Joaquin valley - a flat expanse of fertile agricultural land.  We lived on the edge of the country-side with a cotton field bordering our backyard.  There were no sidewalks.  The summer days were hot and the heat carried over long into the evening.  And the kids of the neighborhood had a freedom to roam that would not be even considered today.  There was a house down the street that we were sure was inhabited by witches.  We braved it on Halloween, but threw away the candy lest it be tainted.    Harper Lee portrayed childhood in such an adept way that the games, fantasies and structure of imagination the children built are as familiar to a California girl today as they are to a child in Alabama in the middle of the depression.  I could identify with everything those children did, thought and said.  It is through a child's eye that the far more serious subject matter of the book is related.    So many things have stuck with me over the years.  Not just the central tragedy of Tom Robinson and the Ewell's. The familiarity of a school pageant.  The struggle to adapt to teachers who don't understand the cultural nuances of the class.  A heroic effort to overcome addiction as a matter of self and principle.  Sultry summer evenings.  Walking like an Egyptian.  The price one pays to learn and acquire values.  Trying to make Boo Radley come out.  Dill.  Calpurnia.  And, of course, Atticus.    I was always sorry that Harper Lee didn't write more.  Then I realized that she didn't need to.  She'd written a perfect book.
B004FLIXVS|4|I was a little disappointed with the song selection here. Live on Two Legs in my opinion is better. I would have liked to have some more of their newer songs and more hard to find cover songs than the recurring live versions of their classics like Alive and Jeremy. If you are a fan from their inception then you have purchased a few of their \\"import\\" concert CD's in the 90's when Tower Records existed. So to me it is a rehash of songs that I already have several versions of already. But being the crazed fan that I am I had to own if for Live versions of two new covers and the songs from Backspacer. While I like it I would give it more of a 3 1/2 stars than 4. And if you could get your hands on the Fox Theater concert from April 3, 1994 then do it, as that IMHO is their best concert CD.
B00B5HQLMI|4|Another action packed, innovative Bond movie. Not one yet that I haven't enjoyed as they plot takes unexpected twist and turns with lots of imagination
B00FMJJ064|5|I first heard her on Pandora and had to buy her albums. She is amazing and I love her infusion of a classical instrument and the electronic sound.
B0073ODRKG|5|This is a cheap and cool way to get all of Madonna's albums in a compact package that doesn't take up nearly as much shelf space as owning all 11 individually-cased CD's.  I call it the \\"Divorce Box-Set\\" because my ex kept all the Madonna albums when we separated.  : )<br /><br />There's not much point in reviewing the albums, because most people know what they're in for, but it's worthy to note that both the Erotica, and Music CD's each contain a single bonus track (\\"Did You Do It?\\" on the former and \\"Cyber Raga\\" on the latter).  They're not stellar songs, but it's neat to have them if you're a collector.  As for the packaging... each CD has a cardboard sleeve much like a miniature LP.  All 11 albums are stacked (loosely) in the outer box.  It's about the thickness of an old double/quadruple CD case... ala Billy Joel's Greatest Hits Vol 1 & 2, or Prince's Emancipation release.  Not bad for 11 albums.  And the price has even decreased since I purchased it, which makes it an awesome deal for anyone who wants all of Madonna's studio albums.<br /><br />I would have been willing to pay a little more to have the 3 compilation CD's included (Immaculate Collection, Something to Remember, and GHV2) but, I'm sure to many that would be repetitive.<br /><br />Great idea.  'Glad I bought it.

Sean also took it to daycare for show-and-tell where it was also a big hit. We like The Gruffalo's Child so much, we have ordered the book that preceded it, The Gruffalo.

B00CWVGBEO|3|Great seeing Arnold back. A little disconcerting how much he has aged sine his sabatical into politics but nevertheless. This is standard 90's action fare very dated for today's audiences. This is a weak script with weak cliched dialogue and \\"plot\\". Wish Arnold had swung for the fences on his comeback but I get the feeling this film was nothing more than him testing the waters. Here is hoping that his next few, which I understand are already in the can, are better than this and we can see him in this a little less predictable. Anyone other than Arnold and this would have gone straight to video.
B004SJ3BCI|5|This game is so addictive because of the mindless destruction with birds. I now know why they so angry I would too if I was flung around.
B00XDCBA42|3|I listened to whole thing on YouTube. Like most of the reviews I did regarding to Joe Satriani albums, this one ranks in the midway compare to his last 2 albums: Blackswans and Wormhole Wizards & Unstoppable Momentum.<br /><br />Shockwave Supernova has a mixture of both sound qualities of the previous albums. The one thing I've notice is that Joe has gotten a lot more latin feel in this album. The odd time signatures felt like I'm listening to a bossa-nova tune or some cuban sound mix with rock.<br /><br />I'm not entirely impressed with the way he handled this venture. But overall, this latest project of Satch has a more happy groove compare to Unstoppable Momentum.
B00DC3DGSK|5|I love Buddy Guy, so I was looking to be pleased, but I was surprised at just how good this CD is, he seems to have kicked it up yet another notch, and I didn't think there was one. Great songs, some really interesting writing, great cameos, particularly Steven Tyler.
B003QSIM30|5|Great lesson taught, about working hard and never giving up on your dreams.
B00DPM90C4|5|This is one book I could not put down, though often times it went into detailed descriptions of why an event(s) took place. It laid the foundation often for reasons the hero did what he felt was the better solution to a problem(s). But, apart from that, the story plot was riveting. Here is a good guy trying to keep America safe for all the right reasons, and a bad guy trying to destroy America for all the wrong reasons...his family, religion, and his troubled boyhood. The ending certainly puts everything into perspective...would you destroy what you considered an enemy for the sake of your beliefs and family, and by the same twist, would you abandon said plot for the sake of your family's safety? Great read!
0441013597|5|Dune...Arrakis...Desert Planet...    This is the best book of all time in my opinion. The level of complexity and that every bit of it is pertanent to the story. I'm not a fan of artsy fartsy ambiguous type stuff that to me seems like a cop-out to actual ideas. I have heard this book has received this label as well, and will agree it isnt an easy read. But everything, i mean everything that happens.. if you are paying attention is a reference point to another part of the book, and in some cases serise.     Well enough with that. In my opinion this book explores humanity and what it is to be human better than any other piece of art or literature I have ever read. Although at the beginning (as often times are observations in life) it seems easy to define who is good an evil. If you read this book and continue on you come to realize through amazingly human characters that people and ideals are very complicated.. good and evil is relative and no one is either. Paul is a product of much, as is the Barron, as are all other characters.     Dune may as well be a history book of the future.. it is as useful in exploring human nature. It even has a biblical.. its a messianic story that teaches, for those willing to absorb, an immense ammount about life, humanity, and the world around you. In my opinion (im an athiest) it is far more useful that the bible because it teaches empowerment as opposed to subsurvience.    One last note, and this will probably sound fake, but its not! When i read this, and all 5 other origional Dune books I was in jail, because I was a drug addict. I became obsessed with them and i credit them to where my life is today. I'm almost done with my bachelors degree with a 3.7gpa(in buisness administraction), sober, have an internship and a powerful private investment firm where im learning so much, and will be attending Graduate school next year.    i probably sound like a crazy person lol.. and no i dont think Paul Muad'Dib is my personal savior.. but ido think this book is a must read!
B0031KC8OC|5|Nice little show

B00BVYLBP2|4|Looking forward to watching the rest of the season. Just wish there was a way to turn on the subtitles. Could not figure it out, even after a lengthly google search for answers.
B000N6TX1I|4|I saw this film when it first came out and then sometime after that.  I really enjoyed it, but I'm not sure that the message I got from it was the one necessarily intended, (indeed if any specific message was intended).  For what it's worth here is what I came away with:  There is a scene in an abandoned school that is falling apart and one of the characters makes the observation how its' very odd what happens in the world without children's voices.  It is in fact odd and horrific; governments have collapsed and anarchy reigns.  It appears that the only hope for humanity may be the baby being carried by a young African woman.  Michael Caine's character makes the statement that her baby is the \\"miracle\\" that the whole world has been waiting for.  The messianic tones are unmistakable.  This is further driven home when having had her baby the young mother carries her child outside and there is a cessation of hostilities between the warring factions.  I'm not sure that Mr. Cuaron, (the director), had a specific message, but I know that it seemed to me that at least on one level the film suggests that there is a sanctity and something sacred about life that perhaps we, (especially in the West), should wake-up to.  Perhaps one of the solutions for tomorrow should be a heightened respect for life as opposed to coming up with more efficient and cavalier ways of preventing it and/or extinguishing it.
B000021Y77|5|I love this movie I just wanted a copy of it so I could watch it. I'm glad I own this.
B000XUBFE2|4|This was a very moving book that gives insight into daily life among the German poor during Q=World War II.  It also shows the small but dangerous acts of bravery that many people engaged in.
B007IXWL2C|5|I loved ever single part, although there was less-shall I same-sex. In some parts it skipped over the sex and went for something else. I'm not too fond  of that is I shall say. I love the way it adds heart ache as she says she's leaving him and  I love the thrill of the anger they give to one another. My boyfriend and  I will sure will be very pleased…with all of the Grey series. I wouldn't mind a Christian Grey as my dominant/boyfriend/husband/father of my children. A very nice character I might add. They all were…especially Ana, strong willed and shy at times-reminds me of myself at times. Very excellent book, like always I would recommend this book to everyone and anyone.
B00BEIYMZ6|5|This was the funniest movie we seen in a long time. The actors were great. The out takes were funny as well. We have watched it several times with friends who come over for popcorn & movie night
B007BVOEPI|5|I EXPECTED MORE BUT IS OK!
B000024QML|5|In 1993, gay music had hit a watershed point. Elton John had hit the charts with \\"The Last Song\\" (from [[ASIN:B0000089F2 The One]]), both kd lang ([[ASIN:B000002LSP Ing&eacute;nue]]) and Melissa Etheridge ([[ASIN:B000001G0U Yes I Am]]) were out of their closets, Bruce Springsteen stepped up to the plate and contributed the theme to [[ASIN:B0000029F1 Philadelphia: Music From The Motion Picture]] and even Garth Brooks, arguably the biggest music star in the world at the time, socked it to the homophobic country music establishment with his song \\"We Shall be Free.\\"<br /><br />In the middle of this was The Pet Shop Boys' \\"Very.\\" Shaking off the chill of [[ASIN:B000002UWL Behavior]] and the often guarded veil their music was often accused of, \\"Very\\" was as personal and as out an album as Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant had ever made. From the sneering, sinister opener \\"Can You For Forgive Her\\" to the subtle altering of the Village People's [[ASIN:B000001EK8 Go West]], this CD was out and danceable, as well as inspired. The music moved between optimistic (\\"Liberation\\") and melancholic (\\"Dreaming of The Queen\\"), striking a perfect balance throughout.<br /><br />Yet it was the blatantly open sexuality of the record that made it so triumphant. \\"Can You Forgive Her\\" goads a closet case for sticking with the undercover girlfriend who mocks his secret.<br /><br />\\"She's made you some kind of laughing stock<br />because you dance to disco and you don't like rock.<br />She made fun of you and even in your bed<br />said she's going to go and get herself a real man instead.\\"<br /><br />But instead of shying away from the consequence, they ask \\"do you want revenge?\\" Seems that coming out is the best revenge in the PSB playbook. From there, \\"Very\\" jumps to the openly giddy \\"I Wouldn't Normally do This Sort of Thing\\" and the affirming \\"Liberation.\\" As a 1-2-3 set of punches, it thoroughly sets the album up for greatness. A little later, they even take a poke at their own image on \\"Yesterday When I Was Mad,\\" plotting their tongue-in-cheek vengeance on all the folks who refused to recognize their brilliance.<br /><br />However, the thoughtfulness that washes through \\"Dreaming Of the Queen\\" echoes \\"Being Boring,\\" but in a more sorrowful way. Told in dream-like language, Neil addressed The Queen and Lady Diana over England's lack of response to the AIDS crisis.<br /><br />\\"The queen said 'I'm aghast<br />Love never seems to last.<br />However hard you try.'<br />And Di replied,<br />'That there are no more lovers left alive<br />No one has survived.'\\"<br /><br />Soon after is \\"The Theatre,\\" which is rich and textured in the manner of \\"It's a Sin\\" ([[ASIN:B00005J9LZ Actually]]) or \\"Left To My Own Devices\\" ([[ASIN:B000002UTK Introspective]]). Taking a theatrical approach to the class distinctions makes for a distinctive song, along with Anne Dudley's orchestration.<br /><br />The final stoke of genius, however, comes from a cover. Much in the way they reclaimed \\"Always On My Mind\\" from country or took the wind out of U2's \\"Where The Streets Have No Name,\\" Pet Shop Boy's fairly reverent version of \\"Go West\\" transforms the song entirely. When Village People recorded it in the 70's as an anthem to liberation and the freedom of San Francisco as an escape from mundane life in backwaters, it felt like a time of limitless possibility. Twelve years later, it struck a note of lost opportunities and the leveling effect of too many lost minds and stolen friends. Even with the bellowing He-Man chorus, there was no way to escape the subtext...that was then, this is now.<br /><br />As such, \\"Very\\" was the high-water mark of Chris and Neil's creative output. Granted, latter albums like [[ASIN:B000EZ8OHW Fundamental]] are still pretty good, but this was a moment captured.

B0000009UG|3|There's a few highlights of this album, but I certainly wouldn't rate it up among Bowie's best. People tend to group this one in with Bowie's underrated albums, I don't really see the point of that. It's not a great album, nor is it a terrible one. <br /> <br />It's No Game (both parts) are great openers and closers, and the idea of having one part that is in English and the other in Japanese is pretty cool. <br /> <br />Ashes to Ashes is of course fantastic and the best song on the album. Fashion for me, is his best song of the '80s (though this was 1979, heh). Scream Like a Baby is equally well done, with the '80s timeline clearly stamped on its production.  <br /> <br />As far as bonus tracks go, the re-recording of Space Oddity (on piano), is great. The re-recording of Panic in Detroit is very lackluster and just badly done overall (though I love the original). Unless you're a Bowie completist, the bonus tracks aren't worth it. <br /> <br />But the album itself has about 4 or 5 really good songs (read: Bowie staples), which is still pretty good for an album of 10 tracks. There's a nice sound throughout the album, but the songwriting itself just runs out of steam. I'd put this in the \\"average Bowie album\\" category.
0790720434|5|This is an excellent film adaption of an excellent novel. What more can I say? The kids do a good job, and Maggie Smith is memorable as Miss Minchin. The outdoor photography of Yorkshire is beautiful and poignant. Wonderful  to see self-salvation against overwhelming odds.
B004VMUS9G|5|The app works and presents itself very well.  My only criticism deals with the current ringtones.  The ringtones were much nicer in the previous version.  I hope they return in the next upgrade.
B00Y6QF0PE|2|Needed story consistency from 50 shades of grey, it really could have been interesting to hear Christians side of the events, but it almost seemed like the author didn't bother fact checking.  She had completely different events happening at different times, it was annoying.
B00006IUL7|4|Insomnia is of course a remake of a Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard, directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg in 1997 but as much as this may make me a heathen to European film culture, I must confess to having never seen the original. However, thanks to one of my good friends (Steve, take a bow) I was lucky enough to see the UK premier of Insomnia as the closing movie of the 2002 Edinburgh film festival and lucky enough to see and hear the Director Christopher Nolan say a few words about this fine movie.<br />Opening with incredibly stunning cinematography of Alaskan ice fields, haggard L.A police detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hep Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in America's most northerly city to help solve the brutal killing of a teenage girl. Met by a local Detective (Hilary Swank) who openly hero-worships Dormer and his successful career as a Detective, Pacino's character sets about showing the local hicks how it's done. However, it soon transpires that Dormer is only in Alaska in the first place to avoid an ongoing criminal investigation by police Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles and it is not long before his investigation into the Alaskan girl's murder goes horribly wrong. Troubled by his conscience and the never-ending daylight of an Alaskan summer Dormer prays for sleep.<br />For many people that have seen either of Christopher Nolan's previous two movies (Following and Memento) Insomnia may seem like an odd choice; it's a 'mainstream' Hollywood movie (Warner Brothers studio), it is told in a linear timeframe and it's a remake. However, there must have been obvious attractions apart from the budget and his paycheck. First off, Stephen Soderbergh, who successfully makes mainstream movies with an Indie heart, oversaw production and secondly there was the chance to work with great actors such as Pacino, Swank and Robin Williams, although at this point I have to add that I believe Williams was totally miscast and made an unconvincing villain.<br />There are some wonderful scenes in this movie, including a nightmare like chase over hundreds of floating logs and the hunt for the killer in a freezing fog. It is also a movie that allows it's stars to shine and this is undoubtedly Pacino's best role (and best movie for many a year) and it is a pleasant change to see him with a decent script in an intelligent movie instead of hamming it up in the likes of The Devil's Advocate, alongside walking surfboard Keanu Reeves. This movie will also undoubtedly and deservedly enhance the careers and reputations of both Director Christopher Nolan and Hilary Swank, who both produce work of depth and subtlety. However, I also feel that much of the credit for what is a beautiful photographed and well-written movie should go to Wally Pfister and (for what is an excellent adapted screenplay) to Hilary Seitz. Insomnia is an excellent movie made by a very modest, very talented young British movie Director. Be warned though, you probably need an IQ to fully appreciate it.lain.<br />There are some wonderful scenes in this movie, including a nightmare like chase over hundreds of floating logs and the hunt for the killer in a freezing fog.

B0000009SM|5|Discovering this Cd was a wonderful day indeed! This was my intro to the zappa camp and I must say, I can't wait to continue. Beleive me, if I had more money, I would buy so. . . .much. . . more! Po-jama people is my favorite song, it relates to my everyday life. So many boring people follow me around, it's just a perfect fit. I am also a big fan of Evelyn, a Modified Dog. I can reflect how great intelligence hides within an unlikely place, and the ability to express is limited. I call all zapsters to buy this A.S.A.P.!

B00GIGGS6A|1|I have had nothing but problems with this tablet.  First, pressure sensitivity didn't work - that's alright. I can fix it. I purchased SAI and it worked just fine for a few days.  After updating to Windows 10, the tablet stopped working altogether. I had to re-install the drivers multiple times before it could work, and even then it only works when it wants to work. Most of the time, I have to re-install the drivers every single time I'm going to use it.  Pressure sensitivity no longer works on ANY program.  This tablet works beautifully if it works, but when it doesn't? It's nothing but trouble. Buy at your own risk.  EDIT:   After numerous months of using this tablet, I've found the solve: do not use with windows 10. I can't get the pressure sensitivity or clicking motion to work on CS6, but other than that it works just fine.   Four stars for not working on photoshop, but otherwise a fantastic product for its price.
B00005JOIF|2|The stage seems to be set for what at first glance would appear to be one of the most politically scathing awards ceremonies in years, the 78th Annual Academy Awards presentation on the ABC television network. No, this is not due in part to the announcement that the Daily Show's Jon Stewart will host the program. This is just another clear sign that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has truly lost touch with its core audience and have reverted to catering to the whims of sniveling television executives eager to lure younger adults, albeit for a few short moments, to contribute to their key demo-rating. It is instead the potential motion picture nominees themselves that will have everyone talking. There is director Ang Lee's controversial gay-cowboy picture, Brokeback Mountain, a film likely to arouse (no sexual pun intended) the pro-gay marriage advocates of California's certifiable liberal base. Here's a puzzler - how does Ang Lee go from directing The Hulk to a romantic-drama about homosexual cowboys in Wyoming? George Clooney, perennial poster boy for the Hollywood left, has two politically controversial pictures up his sleeve - the anti-Joseph McCarthy diatribe, Good Night and Good Luck, and director Stephen Gaghan's `blood for oil' leftist pamphlet piece, Syriana. If you can't recall who Stephen Gaghan is, he directed the Oscar nominated film, Traffic. Can't recall Traffic either? Don't worry, more then likely no one else can either. And what would the Academy Awards be without a tribute to the false-state of Palestine? This year the spineless Europeans honor Palestinian suicide bombers with their foreign-language contribution, Paradise Now. Yes, the same homicidal maniacs who have made the Middle East region the certifiable blood bath it is today. There is no word at this time as to whether film distributor Warner Independent Pictures has chosen to follow former-Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's lead and compensate families of suicide bombers. However, it appears that the most controversial of them all is director Steven Spielberg's `semi-historical' drama, Munich, a portrayal of the events following the massacre of eleven Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. Pro-Israeli advocates, not to mention the Israeli population in general, have come down hard on the Academy Award-winning director of Schindler's List, a tribute to the innocent victims of the Holocaust during World War II, going so far as to claim publicly that he is no longer a `friend of Israel'. My, how times have changed. <br /> <br />Saying the least about it, the story for Munich is perfect. Perfect that is in the sense that is nothing short of a flawless piece of revisionist history drawn from the pulpit of self-loathing Jews, Palestinian terrorists, and the liberal rhetoric of Hollywood elitists. Steven Spielberg's Munich has two fundamental flaws going against it in terms of the film's claim of historical accuracy and legitimacy. First, the George Jonas novel, Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, on which the script is primarily based upon, has been widely discredited leaving most historical and literary critics to regard its contents as a work of complete fiction. Jonas fails to support claims by Yuval Aviv that he was the inspiration for Avner and that he participated in Mossad operations to retaliate against Palestinian terrorists involved with the Munich massacre with either interviews or public statements. Ha'aretz journalist Yossi Melman revealed that Aviv, through investigative reports, \\"had a special fondness for conspiracy theories, and it turned out that he was willing to hire out his services to anyone who was willing to pay\\". The other tragic flaw of this film is playwright Tony Kushner, an openly gay and admittedly self-loathing Jew, who was brought in personally by director Steven Spielberg to rewrite the script originally penned by Eric Roth. Kushner has stated that the creation of the Jewish state of Israel in 1948 was a \\"historical, moral, political calamity\\" for the Jewish people and believes adamantly that the sole intent of the Israeli government is to \\"systematic attempt to destroy the identity of the Palestinian people\\". <br /> <br />Lest it be forgotten, let us make one thing perfectly clear - there never was nor will there ever be a nation called Palestine. The term `Palestine' is a modern word used to define the Middle East legion which prior to World War I was a loose association of Arab tribes which would eventually be placed under the yoke of Nazi imperialism during World War II. The British in 1917 promised the Jews the formation of their own nation, Israel, with the signing of the Balfour Declaration, a promise which was eventually upheld in 1948. There exists no Palestinian `refugee problem' today because refugees can not exist if there is no land from which they happen to be displaced from to begin with. The disdainful Arab nations which encircle the entire nation-state of Israel refuse to take in their own so that they may be used as a prominent example of the `atrocities' the Jews have committed and that Israel may forever be used as a scapegoat for their cruelty and malice. <br /> <br />Overall, Munich, albeit skillfully choreographed, suitably acted out, and brilliantly scored by long-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams, lacks the sufficient credibility in its anti-Israel/pro-Palestinian rhetoric driven storyline to make it a truly riveting historical drama. Munich's most glaring weakness, Kushner's screenplay, is so extreme in its revisionist interpretation of historical events it is likely to maker even pseudo-`documentarian' Michael Moore blush. Frankly the film is not all bad. Spielberg went to extraordinary lengths in the short few months of its production (filming began in July 2005, days after his two-hundred million dollar blockbuster, War of the Worlds, opened in theatres) to have nearly every scene in Munich reflect the styles, the culture, and the atmospheric feel of the 1970s. <br /> <br />First off, much to the embarrassment of Judaism in general, Spielberg and Kushner establish a level of confusion with their own twisted sense of moral relativism when it comes to the interpretation of the specific values and principles on which the Jewish religion is founded upon, an action which is hardly surprising given their fall out from their homeland. After an all too brief scene in which the Israeli athletes in Munich are taken hostage by terrorist agents of Black September, Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir is seen meeting with Israeli officials to construct a plan of retaliation against the Palestinians for the massacre. In this meeting she states, \\"Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values\\", which of course is in reference to Israel's plans to assassinate suspected members of the terrorist organization, Black September. Although Spielberg and Kushner would like it to appear as though the Jews are doing exactly that in responding to the blatant act of terrorism in Munich, this is in fact far from the truth. Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, an entertainment reporter for Belief.net, in his assessment of the Spielberg picture clarifies on this issue, \\"The Talmud [a record of rabbinic discussions on Jewish law, ethics, customs, legends and stories] clearly establishes that one who comes to murder you must first be killed themselves. Those who have devoted their lives to killing innocent people have erased the image of God from their countenances and have therefore erased their right to life\\". It is rather Christianity which advocates the concept of `turning the other cheek' against your enemies and even then it does no such thing in suggesting that total submission be taken whenever a force seeks to commit harm against you or your loved ones. <br /> <br />The false Golda Meir, a woman who in her historical context was the Margaret Thatcher of the newly founded Jewish state, offers further words of wisdom. When an Israeli official questions how this action of retaliation against the Palestinians will corrupt efforts for peace in the region, she argues, \\"forget peace for now, we have to be strong\\". Peace and strength, while distinctly different entities, are in no way incompatible with each other contrary to popular liberal mythology. Strength would hardly be an option had Al Gore been elected president when September 11th occurred, nor would there be peace. Terrorists, particularly al Qaeda, prey upon the indecisive, the timid, the weak and exploit peace deals and negotiation efforts to their utmost advantage as President Jimmy Carter can clearly vouch for. Any time in which Israel or the United States of America have flexed their muscles and stood up to those who seek to destroy our very way of life, only then have we gained the respect of the world. They may not like us for it, but we have garnered to respect. <br /> <br />In his screenplay Kushner then proceeds to scold Israel for the bombing of Palestinian `refugee camps' in Syria and Lebanon four days following the Munich massacre which killed two-hundred people. And yet he fails to mention that two years earlier Jordan slaughtered ten-thousand Palestinians with the surviving refugees fleeing to the West Bank in Israel. This act was the true inspiration for the terrorist organization behind the Munich massacre, Black September. <br /> <br />The tragic events of the Munich massacre which took place on September 5th, 1972, are never shown in their entirety together. Rather they are spread throughout the two hour and twenty minute motion picture. Most distressing and disturbing of all, the actual slaughter of the nine remaining Israeli athletes in the midst of a failed rescue attempt by German authorities is spliced with scenes of Avner having sex with his wife. The actual climax of the massacre is Avner literally climaxing. It is herethat Spielberg as a filmmaker makes his most egregious error. Rather then memorialize the unmitigated slaughter of these eleven Israeli athletes with a proper theatrical tribute he instead chooses to trivialize their deaths, shaping events to his liking so they suit his agenda. The separation of the actual massacre of the Israeli athletes from the beginning of the film drives home Spielberg's point that `violence begets violence, blood begets blood' and that the Munich massacre was merely a response to a response. Spielberg in his Judaist backpedaling fails to acknowledge what exactly the Palestinian kidnapping and murder of eleven Israeli athletes was in response to but, as with most leftist revisionist history, facts and the truth are merely an afterthought. <br /> <br />Furthermore, Spielberg in his depiction of historical events which soon followed the Munich massacre conspicuously leave out important details and significantly alter audience's perceptions of the state of Israel. This includes the Arab nations at the Munich Olympics who refused to lower their flags to half-staff in light of the tragedy, essentially endorsing Black September and the terrorist attack which took place there. And let's not forget the International Olympic Committee's refusal to construct a permanent memorial to the eleven slain Israeli athletes out of fear of `offending' those hostile to Israel. More importantly however Spielberg chooses to depict the response to the Munich massacre, in this case the assassination of eleven individuals in connection to Black September, as immediate and unrelenting when in fact it was never initialized until after October 29th, 1972, when Germany released the three surviving Black September kidnappers after a German jet carrying them was hijacked. The Germans suspiciously did this so that the three survivors would not face trial and implicate the German government, still reeling from fall out of the Holocaust during World War II, for the haphazard response. <br /> <br />Although it is Spielberg's intention to place the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team agents on the same moral footing as the Palestinian terrorists of Black September and the PLO, each group's portrayal in the film is significantly different. Only one of the three targets the Mossad agents pursue is shown committing the loathsome acts of terrorism for which they are accused. Instead they are portrayed as either kindly old men or inoperative political activists with adorable children. The Mossad agents are not given such a luxury. They are seen basking in the deaths of those they target. They scrutinize over every dollar spent in pursuit of their objectives. And one agent's tilted argument, \\"The only blood that matter to me is Jewish blood\\", in response to another agent questioning the amount of collateral damage their bombs meant for their targets may cause shows them to be fideists. They are everything short of complete and utter monsters. <br /> <br />True, Spielberg falls short of portraying the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team as total miscreations. For example, Avner and a fellow agent risk blowing their cover when they realize that a call received by the phone built with a remote detonator explosive placed in the target's apartment has been answered by the target's young daughter and alert their other team members waiting in a nearby car to abort the mission. In spite of evidence in the film to suggest that the Israeli Counter-Terrorism Team avoided as much collateral damage as physically possible, risking their lives just to confirm the identity of their target via matching photos with the suspects' faces before they are killed, Spielberg in the end argues that these assassinations were all for naught. Since so few of the targets who were killed had direct links to the Munich massacre, though they were undoubtedly in some form or another associated with the PLO, the only contribution their deaths made was in the creation of more terrorists whowere even worse then the ones Mossad eliminated in the first place. This is the same demented, twisted logic the rhetorical left uses in opposing U.S. military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their suggestion that going after terrorists for the slaughter of innocent civilians will only lead to more aggressive attacks on our own soil is laughably preposterous. They would rather have our head buried in the ground with our butts high in the air just waiting for the other shoe of Islamic fascism to come down on us rather then respond to it. Let's get something straight here - killing terrorists does not create more terrorists. Did killing Nazis during World War II create more Nazis? Did arresting Klu Klux Klan members create more Klansmen? No, so why would it be any different in this situation? It is a tragically flawed logic; one sadly the radical left in this country seems intent on sticking to. In that case, let us no longer try and prevent murder, rape, underage sex, substance abuse, child molestation, or any crime whatsoever because apparently any effort we make to prevent such activities will only create more rapists, murderers, drug users, and terrorists, so it is best just to let it sort itself out. <br /> <br />This brings us to what is unquestionably the most insulting image in Munich. In the final scene of the film Avner, played by Troy's Eric Bana, meets with Ephraim, his Mossad handler, in a park and tells him he can no longer return to Israel because it is not the moral haven it once was. As the two depart, the camera slowly pans over a 1970s New York City skyline and remains transfixed for a time on the haunting image of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. It does not take a genius to figure out what Spielberg and Kushner mean to suggest here. September 11th is our Munich. A response to a response - nothing more. They mean to suggest that the tragic deaths of both the eleven Israeli athletes in Munich and the nearly three thousand American citizens in NYC, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania were brought upon ourselves. Their lives should be honored, yes, but not in response against those who committed these acts of treachery. Heaven knows, why bother battling cancer if a cure has yet to be found. Better to succumb to despair and die with `dignity' then fight to the bitter end and only make a dent in it. What honor is there in that? For those on the left who like the five year old children they mirror with their petty partisan squabbling who have yet to grasp the concept of sarcasm, everything!
0385503954|4|Anne of Green Gables lived in the real world?  She would be Briony Tallis, still as fanciful as ever, but now her actions have consequences.  That is what I thought of as I read this book.  Indeed thirteen year old Briony is also a budding writer, who takes extraordinary flights of imagination, and has incredible drama for everyday events in her life. Like Anne, Briony is also capable of summoning up outrage at the events in the world around her. <br />It is just this outrage which unintentionally sets off a terrible chain of events. Briony witnesses an episode between her sister, Cecilia and their childhood friend, Robbie.  This is followed up by more events, in the same day,  that Briony is too young to understand, plenty of childish imagination, and then one final horror in the late evening.  This sets the stage for an emotionally charged Briony to mistakenly identifying someone.<BR>The rest of the story follows the fallout of that one day.  <br />Atonement is a splendid story, told very much through the impressions of the characters rather than their actions.  This lends the novel an emotional immediacy that allows the reader to walk slowly through the narration and savour every bit.  We feel the lurking menace early on in the novel, the sickly sweet heat of the victorian home, the emotional cascades of the characters, the heat of surprise love making, and the horrors of war.<br />While I feel that this is a fine novel, there were things that I felt weren't really necessary.  The narration from the POV of Emily, Briony's mother, doesn't really add anything to the story. It shares no new information, nor is Emily a main character to the story.  It was, in my opinion, a waste of space.  I also felt that some plot points were a tiny bit weak (especially Robbie's conviction and Lola's marriage), however, this may be forgiven as the book is less about the plot lines than about the effect upon the characters.

B000JQUKKU|5|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the Charles Dicken's classic written in 1843.  I've seen multiple movie versions, but I haven't actually read the book until this year.  Reading it opened my eyes to a few things that I haven't noticed before and/or don't remember from the movies.<br /><br />While I don't think any spirits will come and visit me in the middle of the night, Dickens' spirits spoke to me in a sense in that it made me stop and think about my attitude this time of year, and what I'm doing to help others.  I knew what to expect as the story unfolded, but it was still a joy to follow Scrooge on his familiar path and to see his literal overnight change!<br /><br />Merry Christmas, and as Tiny Tim would say, \\"God bless us, every one!\\"

B008J9EYFG|4|I've been a fan of Beth Orton from the early days, and have followed her career with great interest. I will admit that I was let down by her most recent album, 2006's \\"Comfort of Strangers\\", as it seemed Orton wasn't quite sure how to evolve from \\"folktronica\\" yet remain true. After a long 6 year wait, we finally get the newest album (released Oct, 2012).<br /><br />\\"Sugaring Season\\" (10 tracks; 37 min.) kicks off with the most 'urgent' track on here, an almost epic \\"Magpie\\", which is the only track that features the backing band in full force. When tracks 2 and 3 \\"Dawn Chorus\\" and \\"Mystery\\" gently roll in, it is clear that indeed the days of \\"folktronica\\" are gone for good. But as the tracks go on by, what struck me is that the album sounds deceptively simple, yet in the end plain gorgeous. Check out \\"Something More Beautiful\\" (co-written with M. Ward), which reminds me of the sound from Over the Rhine. My favorite track on the album is \\"Poison Tree\\", which kicks off the second half of the album, and it's like Joni Mitchell from 40 years ago. Track 9 \\"State of Grace\\" is in the same Joni-vein, just great. As \\"Last Leaves of Autumn\\" opens with Beth on piano, my first thought was \\"Natalie Merchant\\", and I mean that as a compliment as well.<br /><br />At just 37 min., this album clips by in no time, and I have been playing this a LOT. I had the good fortune of catching Beth Orton live at the U Street Music Hall in Washington, DC last May, when she was 'road-testing' material from this album (playing Poison Tree, Candles, and Mystery), but also bringing many nuggets from the past (including a bunch from \\"Central Reservation\\" and \\"Trailer Park\\" such as Stolen Car, Sugar Boy, etc. etc.). What a great performance that was. Meanwhile \\"Sugaring Season\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B005J9ZE5I|5|This is a must have for any fan of Horror in general. A lot of people think this is a remake of the first Evil Dead and they're right to a certain extent but not entirely. If you watch the commentary or do your research you'll learn that they had problems with getting footage from the original film so basically the first 10 or so minutes of Evil Dead 2 are a sort of recap of the original Evil Dead where they trim things down to just Ash and Linda.<br />*SPOILERS* The end of The Evil Dead features the unseen Demonic force sneaking up on Ash and knocking him through the woods. So in Evil Dead 2 when the invisible force knocks Ash through the woods and he wakes up in the mud puddle possessed only to have the demon forced out by the sun that is actually where Evil Dead 1 ends and Evil Dead 2 TRULY begins *END SPOILERS*<br />This film is a horror classic and the Blu-Ray is full of great features and the film itself has never looked or sounded better. And with the low price even if you own a dozen version of this film there's really no reason for you not to pick this up, especially if you're a fan of the films or just horror in general.
B000SZH66S|5|Just got this and So Tonight That I Might See. Can't believe I waited this long to listen two these two flawless albums.
0812974611|4|After completing the book, I was inspired to learn even more about Pompeii even though I've visited there! There's a plethora of fabulous books at Amazon. Wish I'd read this one before I went. I am really thrilled to know that Roman Polanski is now making the movie version of it.     The aqueduct system detail-upon-detail was of less interest to me, and I found myself skimming through some of it, but with the inspiration to read more on life in Pompeii, this book is close to the top of my reading list this year.
B00FN811SY|5|Thank you very much for this wonderful gift! It's priceless! I will cherish it and I appreciate the hard work done on this.

0060012358|5|This ... this is a bit of a go at the Pied Piper story. With a touch of Puss in Boots. And practically every fluffy bunny story every written. Mostly told by Maurice and an assemblage of Changed, and quite educated, rats.<br />The story is starts off simple. Talking cat, smart rats, stupid-looking kid with whistle. Go into town, plague of rats, pay stupid-looking kid money to drive rats out. Move on to next town. Easy money. That is, until they get to Bad Blintz, an apparently ratless town that doesn't seem to know they're ratless. Then things get a little ... interesting.<br />There's a definite vein of silliness lurking in the background, even with all the seriousness of killing and talks of death going on. I do love the rat names: Dangerous Beans, Nourishing, Hamnpork, Peaches, Sardines (in fact, I love everything about Sardines) and Darktan. I love how the rats are still rats and not all 'Mr. Bunnsy'. A little reminiscent of the Mrs Frisby and the Rats of N.I.M.H. or Watership Down there (and, the occasional time, The Tale of Desperaux). Only with a nicer ending.<br />And the ending ... classic Pratchett twist there.
B003B02PF4|3|Not his best effort, but still enjoyable. As long as you keep in mind that it's fiction, and ignore the technical inaccuracies, you'll probably enjoy it, too.
B00BAXFECK|3|This was a rare book, which I couldn't put down, yet didn't really care for the central character.  I would recommend it to a friend, as it's not just a story, but a fascinating look at the personal value of art, growing up with PTSD, and learning what makes lasting relationships.  Complex and moving!

B000NQR7KM|4|Whatever they did to enhance the sound of this Cd,its wonderful! The packaging of this is very nice too. One CD  music, the other Cd the Enhanced version of Trick plus the DVD section.  <br />  The DVD is comprised of interviews about Trick and footage of the band. On this particular DVD, it has \\"Robbery, Assault & Battery\\", which was played  on MTV many moons ago. That was great! Genesis in this stage of their musical journey  was just getting over the departure of Peter Gabriel.Watch the interview part,they explained how Phil was not to be the original singer. They had many singers, but just could not make that unity. I am sorry back to DVD concert footage. This is the first time you have a great view of Bill Bruford playing extremely well.(looks like a young kid!)  <br />  This is going to be a series of all the Genesis music, including The Lamb.

B001DDBCUU|5|I have been waiting for this movie to happen for so long and I wasn't disappointed. It was great seeing the girls again and it just made me realise how much I really missed the series. I do hope that there is another movie, but, I think that maybe there won't be one, seeing how they seemed to tie up all the loose ends - except for Samantha. Once again a great movie, long awaited and for all those Sex and the City fans, one not to be missed.
B00DSO9RMC|4|It was fantastic and great to know there was a Discworld novel I had not read.  The correlation with the way steam was first introduced to our world was fascinating and the ins and out of racial tension is so well done.  What a legend Terry Pratchett is.
B00AREIAI8|5|This is an awesome game
B008HB34I4|5|This is not religious at all - in fact you might call it anti-organized religion.  Great flick - entertaining - not a momemt slow - but very interesting.
B005HV6Y84|3|This CD has much more classical music than the other 3 cd's from the Twilight movies. I liked this music CD much better. You are not interruped constantly from bad music.
B0051ANPZQ|5|Excellent read.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B00005JMXX|1|This is the end of the world as told through the lense of the most liberal production team in Hollywood. It comes complete with a cheesy enviromental message and corny special effects.<br /><br />I can't wait to see the sequel; \\"The Day After Two Days From Now\\" It's about when excessive airplane and SUV use knock Mars out of orbit...and send it hurdling straight toward earth. Peter O'Toole and Megan Fox star, Al Gore and Hilary Clinton direct.
B0056K4VRM|5|To quote KUSC's sagacious Jim Svejda. And again, \\"an enduring monument (that is, Walter's mostly late '50s recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra) to one of the greatest twentieth-century conductors.\\"<br /><br />At over six hours of magnificent and varied (and 24 bit) Mozart for roughly 20 bucks as of this writing, this set is a steal.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
0307730697|5|One of the greatest books I have ever read, could not put it down. Amazing man & family!
B0083P1QUM|4|I always enjoy reading Patricia Cornwell's books.  However, it seemed this storyline seemed to be drawn out more than her other books.  It was still a good read.
038572179X|5|Ian McEwan is one of the most highly-regarded novelists working today, and with damn good reason. Atonement is an outstanding novel. It is the story of one day in the life of 13 year old Briony Tallis, and the terrible crime she commits, and her eventual attempt at \\"atonement\\". Briony is an aspiring writer (and, we are aware from the start, she will eventually be a very highly regarded novelist), and she is planning to present a play for her beloved older brother Leon, visiting from London, on this day in 1935. The first half of the book presents the events of that day through the intertwined perceptions of several people: Briony; her older sister Cecilia, who has just finished at Cambridge; their charlady's son, Robbie, who has also finished at Cambridge and will be trying for medical school (sponsored by Mr. Tallis); and Briony's mother Emily Tallis, an invalid whose husband stays away and is clearly cheating on her. The other key characters are the Quinceys: 15 year old Lola and 9 year old twin boys Jackson and Pierrot, who have come to stay with the Tallises while their parents (Emily's sister and her husband) go through a divorce.  <br /> <br />Briony recruits her cousins to act in her play but they seem ready to ruin it. Robbie and Cecilia, long friends from having grown up together, begin to discover a deeper attraction. The amiable Leon shows up with his crude and rich friend Paul Marshall. Dinner ends suddenly with the young boys running away, and a terrible event while searching for them is compounded by Briony's \\"crime\\", which I won't reveal but is truly wrenching, truly a \\"crime\\", but in a way understandable.  <br /> <br />The novel then jumps forward 5 years to the beginning of the War, specifically the retreat from Dunkirk, and the effects of Briony's crime are revealed. Briony herself begins to try to atone ... Finally, in 1999 the aging Briony, a lionized novelist, reflects on her secrets, and on her final attempt at atonement.  <br /> <br />It's really excellent stuff -- terribly wrenching, also sweetly moving, quite exciting. The view of the events at Dunkirk is a very effective. Briony, Robbie, and Cecilia are captured with exactness and honesty. The prose is very fine, very balanced and elegant. The real thing.  <br />
B00CSR2J9I|5|I find Hill Climb Racing a fun and playful game. Although it is a little glitchy on certain tracks, i find it really fun.
0143120530|5|Amazing book
B00V4JHNZG|2|Exhibit A as to why we need to stop splitting up movies to be longer so studio execs can make more money.
B004GJDQT8|5|I became a Prime member and it was the best decision ever! I always find everything I need and more. And the neat thing is no shipping and I get it in 2 days. They out rate any other online store for returns also.
B00FATEJYE|5|Everything about this game is sweet. There's no flaw whatsoever. Just straight up awesome! Love everything about it. Nice job, guys.
B000JMKQX0|3|World War Z is fun to read and the flashback interview plot is interesting but not enough to really draw you in.  The pages are filled with cliches and half-baked satire on modern cultures.  Max Brooks's portrayal of women characters is laughable - he attempts to show women in an admirable light but ends up being insincere.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the zombie genre or is looking for an easy summer read.  If you read a lot of books, you may see through his prose and not enjoy it.
B00IIU9U00|5|All the 1-star people are too sensitive, and probably 99.9% women. It was based on a true story, and was done tastefully. Why tastefully? Due to the fact, the &#34;real-version&#34; was most likely more profound, vulgar, and explicit! Started as a nobody, and became one of the most powerful members in society. Every guy's dream, every woman's nightmare. Sure he's a pig, no doubt. But if you think making a million dollars a month won't change someone, good luck with that fantasy.
B00IUBM8PQ|4|Good movie stayed close to the book
B003UESJH4|5|Besides the terrific casting of Colin Firth as the king, I also noticed a face that looked vaguely familiar, but couldn't quite place her. I'm writing about the wife of the king. (This before I checked the names of all the cast on the cover).  Something about her reminded me of other films I'd seen her in before, but I wasn't sure because whe looked and sounded so totally different.  The same thing happened when I saw her in Harry Potter playing the evil witch, Bellatrix Lestrang. Again, something familiar about her. So, I checked to make sure it was the same wonderful actress I saw in Howard's End, Helen Schlegel.  It was. And now the the king's wife, yet another entirely different role. The wife of \\"Bertie\\", the King. I'm writing of course of Helena Bonham Carter.  In each film she looked and sounded entirely different.  What a great actress she is!  This, so different from so many Hollywood actresses who keep playing the same type role in every film.  (This doesn't apply, of course, to Meryl Streep who can play any role in any film and play it perfectly.) Examples of a few recent ones:  Julie and Julia: playing Julia Childs, a happy go lucky incredible chef with a great sense of humor,  Doubt, playing Sister Aloysius Beauvier, an overly suspicious nun, and The Devil Wears Prada, whose head of a famous fashion magazine, considered by some movie reviewers to be the greatest living film actress in that particular film. Can they all be the same person?  Can that nun, that chef and that fashion editor and the many other roles she's played all be the same actress.       Well, anyway, back to The King's Speech.  A perfect film.  I'm so glad I watched it.  I'd seen a bit of it before with a friend who had just rented it and was playing it at my house for a short time, but I saw so little, I couldn't possibly have gotten more than a tiny taste of it.  Then after buying the film, and watching the whole thing, I was stunned.  It absolutely was a great movie, a fascinating story, inspiring, and everyone in the cast was perfect. I'm also happy they chose Colin Firth (Pride and Prejudice) to play the king, and Geoffrey Rush, one of Australia's most popular and distinguished actors to be his tutor.  They were great together!
B00N35P5MW|1|Didn't care for it/
B00D7Z4GQY|5|My favorite read of the year!  Perfect combo of plot twists romance and suspense!  seriously, don't pass this one up, you'll love it!!!

B00005JNJV|5|The new Batman movies are awesome. I love Batman, I hope they come out with a third movie soon.
B000OZ2CZW|3|The first song (Umbrella) jumps right at you but from there the cd falls off. There are so many big name producers and artiest involved in this cd that I forgot who was the featured artist. Every track sounds like some one else is trying to make there mark in the music world and that is the problem The cd sounds like every one but, Rihanna. Over all it's a nice up beat cd something to get ready for a night at the clubs.<br /><br />  On the second listen I noticed that working with other artiest and producers actually gave this cd some extra flair and on track 5 you catch a hint of Depech Mode and on track 3 you cant go wrong any time you use stuff from Michael Jackson especially when you can use the words mamma say mamma sah mamma muckusah its always a good thing.
B008WCP2KG|5|Great dancing and eye candy, plot not so much. Hopefully second installment will have all three.
B0087HT36U|5|This game is a lot of fun.  Game play is easy to understand, and controls are easy to use.  Graphics aren't amazing, but they give the game a fun look.  The game is one of the best I have played.

B00Q7WBFTA|4|Good story
B000FJN63Y|5|This is an interesting story. It is a story of a lawyer who appears to have it all - the corner office, the life style, the cars, women, ... Then he gives it all up and tours the East. While there he comes across this strange monk and monastery. He comes to live life in a much different way. Yet he is challenged by the monk who has trained him to go back home and share the message he has learnt, with the West. Julian, our main character, returns to his old law firm and to his prot?g? John. He tells him a parable; then the rest of the book explains the parable and how it relates to different aspects of our lives. The parable is rather simple and a little strange but as it is explained you will never forget it. Read it to find out how a garden, lighthouse, sumo wrestler, pink wire cable, stopwatch, roses and a winding path of diamonds are symbols of timeless principles and virtues by which to live your life. This book could help raise the quality of your life to a new level.
B00HBQWGXK|5|...is that now that I've finished I'll have to wait a year for the next one!  Another great Reacher thriller.
B00F87ZUYG|5|It is the best show ever on TV!! I just Love Rick, Glenn,Daryl, Hershel, Maggie and even Carol after the recent incident. They have really learned to survive and have become a family.

B002LK3DUQ|5|Great movie! Plays perfect! Super funny! The digital copy is an awesome way to carry the movie with you and keep the younger kids occupied on longer car trips if you dont have a portable dvd player.  I only wish Disney would do this for all their movies! I never buy BluRay as I dont have a player so its hard to find a DVD copy with the digital copy anymore! I am very satisfied, this was a great find and an excellent purchase!   A great addition to any family movie collection.
B003TSEEDY|5|Not normally a fan of YA, this book kept me captivated the whole time.  I loved the characters and the story.  Brilliant.
B00005QW5X|5|I've read some reviews where people just didn't understand, and I can understand some of that. It's a story about a world far from our own, and that's why i think it's so amazing. Hedwig is an amazing person, and I found this movie hysterical and touching.    If you are one for indie, documentary-like films then you should see this! The music is amazing, and 'midnight radio' is now a top fav of mine. I think this movie is loved by a select crowd, but still should been seen by everyone.   However I don't think I'd watch this with my parents, lol. Some parts of the movie are odd, nothing wrong with the scenes...just culturally odd. :/  for example, the gummy bear scene. Yet I still loved every minute of it.     Hope all of you will enjoy the movie :)
B00005JG6Q|4|First of all, if you haven't seen &quot;Akira&quot; before, STOP READING and BUY the disc already. It really is the pinnacle of Japanimation, as far as I'm concerned. The cels are dazzling, and nothing has even approached the minute detail of this film, and it was made in the late Eighties! If you HAVE seen the initial English dub released around 1990, then you are in for an interesting ride because this is a completely different film. The dialogue is not only done by new actors, but nearly every line is changed from the previous dub. One obvious change is pronuciations of the character's names: &quot;Akira&quot; isn't &quot;uh-KEE-ruh,&quot; as in the first English dub. Now, it's pronounced, &quot;AH-kee-dah,&quot; with the DAH spoken as a hard &quot;R.&quot; Kaneda isn't &quot;kah-NAY-dah,&quot; but &quot;KAH-nah-dah.&quot; It takes a bit of getting used to if you've seen the original English dub as many times as I have, but it's still a classic piece of animation that can still blow your mind every bit as much as it did in 1990. I recommend this version, although since I am still very much fond of the previous version, I would have liked it if they included the first English dub in a separate audio track. But alas, I am just grateful to see &quot;Akira&quot; back on the market so that anime fans, new and old, can continue to appreciate this master work.
B0019AGD6A|4|enjoyed the story line hope to finish the rest of the books
B00QLVY7J2|4|Challenging and fun
B00070Q7VO|5|Not your typical crooner this man. He must have music running thru his veins. Sophisticated sweet sounds sung smoothly with the purest of real emotion sums up his presentation. Magnificent in every sense of the word!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />The sensual Song for you and Try a little tenderness are packed with raw emotion, Buble caresses each note tenderly. Magnificent. <br />Upbeat How sweet it is is so sweet and Save the last dance could remedy anyones down day. Magnificent
B000001F6N|5|Too bad kids today either don't know about or can't remember this stuff. It was 'A Hard Road' to get to where we are now musically. I don't think that what passes for good music today has much to do with the roots of John Mayall. This Idol/Pop crap sucks.
B0098VXMNE|5|I love this story. Saw it as a child and this remake is fantastic
B00000AFWW|2|The first song &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; was catchy, the other woman in  the song was nice, but after the first song...  It goes downhill real fast.   I would have preferred an album full of cynical fluff like the first song,  instead of boring crap like the rest of the album.
B00PRXDUE8|5|5 stars
B000BVQ9JO|1|Their First Album was already over-Rated but this One is really Bad. Having Never Seen them live i cannot really comment on what males them so popular, but their Sound is too Sloppy. After an ok First Song it is downhill.
B00874T02K|5|I love all of the features on this app and it's flexibility to deal with different fitness levels.

B00B6U63ZE|5|The book truly captures the essence of what it takes to transition and build teams in a company depending on the inherent circumstances of said company. I will be referencing this book as a staple going forward personally and with my team
B009UX2YAC|5|I love this game but the only thing is it freezes a lot and you loose all your characters<br />Then you have to start again
B004SBS8LA|2|I like the game, but it won't update.  App store just force closes every time I try to download it. On moto droid
B00FATEJYE|2|Took a long time to download and froze a lot on my kindle.  This is basically mortal combat with DC comic characters.  It wasn't very clear what the objective was and the game seems to be just tapping and swiping on the screen to defeat opponents.  The graphics looked good.
B005544TRQ|5|Love this show!!!
0374158460|5|I didn't read any reviews before I finished, because I didn't want to be influenced.      I liked \\"The Corrections\\" very much, but I LOVED \\"Freedom\\". I loved every page of this book.  They both have very unlikeable characters and dysfunctional family, but this time, Franzen let me believe in \\"goodness\\"in each character.   Funny thing was, I was thinking about Tolstoy before Patty read \\"War and Peace\\" in the book (I didn't think about Updike like other reviewers mentioned). Thorough a family saga, Franzen gives a vivid portrait of contemporary America.     Some may dislike the hopeful ending. Especially young readers.  But, ending such a great literally fiction with a hopeful and forgiving note is a lot more difficult than you can imagine. And, Franzen accomplished it so beautifully. I couldn't stop crying in the end.     This is the best book I have read this year (or even the last 5 years).     To those who gave one star because they didn't like the kindle price, please do me a favor and remove your review.   Authors DO NOT have a control over pricing. Why do you punish authors?     Also, Franzen spent almost 9 years to write this book. If you read it, you'll notice every word in 562 pages is carefully chosen, and there's no unnecessary line. Do you still think 12.99 is too expensive for a kindle version? I don't think so.
B00IOVH8AW|5|This sobg is awasome!!!
B006UKFFE0|5|Great detailed guidance on applying the lean startup principles. It uses the authors personal experience in applying Lean startup for his own venture.
B004X6PRO6|2|I I joy literature and other fiction, but this book just failed to maintain my interest. Only made it 17% of the way through, after repeated attempts. I suppose it tells us something about North Korea in a particular time period, but I find myself completely uninterested in the main character. Disappointing.
B006MW3UZW|5|I love Downton Abbey.  All the seasons are great.  Looking forward to season 5.
B0094LYJZI|5|Sappy love story about a shallow, good looking teenager who thinks only of himself and his looks. He has nothing of merit in his character until a witch in his high school puts a spell on him. He is transformed into the appearance or his character &#34;inside.&#34; He looks &#34;beastly&#34; and has one year to prove he is worthy of someone who loves him dispute his looks.Someone to tell him they love him as he is.<br />I think the movie went too fast and lost so much potential as noted by another viewer who gave an in-depth review. I agree with the other reviewer about the movie. The film makers should have stuck to the book and the ending would have been less sappy. The beauty of the film is there with the interaction between the lead actors' characters. Nevertheless, I loved this movie, but remake it already,
B004LROUNG|4|I had read several of Grisham's books in the past and enjoyed them. Then they all kind of seemed the same. When our next pick in our bookclub was &#34;The Litagators,&#34; I wasn't hopeful. I really enjoyed it. It started out good, wained a little, then finished well. I would recommend this book. Grisham's fans, of course, won't be disappointed. But those of us who have strayed might be brought back into his snare.
B0076L9W9Q|5|Halestorm is so amazing!!! They are just so amazing!!! They blew me away, and I love Lizzy's voice when she sings! She is amazing!!! She is just so amazing!!! Halestorm is my favourite band EVER!!! They are the best!!!
B000V63BN6|5|What can anyone say negative about any Stevie Wonder music?  Come on...
B0000062FL|5|If you love Carlos Santana, this album is probably the best he ever produced. There are several of his greatest hits that are on every \\"greatest hits\\" collections; but even the songs that never make those collections were great as well.
B00007BHOE|5|i love this dvd any way i love slipknot and any thing they got i love there style and anythig if u wanna buy this dvd just buy it
B00CY1JUW2|5|....and this will be one of them. You always remember the album that converted you into a fan and this is that album for me and others who only had QOTSA on the edge of their musical radar as a remnant of the immediate post-Grunge scene. I hear everything from Soundgarden and Bush to Nine Inch Nails and Foo Fighters, but what I mostly hear is a very strong collection of songs that stretch out into a variety of approaches. I had not realized just how powerful and Bowie-like Josh Homme sounded as a singer as previous albums tended to become white-washed with heavy, dingy guitar, but &#34;...Like Clockwork&#34; creates more space than any other QOTSA work; space that is left open for minimalist approaches at times, until the band opens up the valve full-blast and sounds bigger than ever. One of the best surprises of 2013.
B00005N5S5|5|new.
B004DHUAZQ|5|Good old fashioned action movie. It doesn't deserve any awards but it's fun.

0061474355|5|Sabriel is definitely a masterpiece. I have read this book probably 9 times now. No kidding! I first picked the book up in 2001 when I was in high school. I can honestly say that this was the first book I actually \\"read\\" straight through without hardly putting down. The character development is very well done. Specifically with Sabriel coming into her own as The Abhorsen. Mogget, the cat, is a very funny comic relief, where as, Touchstone the sworn sword for her, is the strong silent type. All three characters blend together to make a wonderful fantasy novel. It's full of action adventure, suspense, comedy little romance. Everything a good novel should be. I would suggest to anyone who is a fantasy fan, read this book and the entire series.
B0042U94UQ|5|One of my son's favorite movies. Part 2 is even Better!
B00L8O7KW8|3|Eva Green's performance is amazing. The movie as a whole is a good watch but Eva Green steals the show.
0765325950|4|It was one week after having suffered a series of strokes when I learned of Robert Jordan's death from a small TV hanging over my hospital bed. Of course I had heard of him and his Wheel of Time series many times before, but I had never read any of his work. Something about the timing of his death and my own recent experiences made me want to get to know this man better. I felt sorrow for all of his fans, how his story would never be completed.<br /><br />A couple months later I heard refreshing news; the news that another writer would pick up the mantle and write Jordan's last volume. I remember thinking to myself how generous of Robert to allow someone else to finish his tale - how selfless an act to prepare for another artist to add the final touches. I was blown away and I rushed to catch up in time for the final battle.<br /><br />I found myself falling into RJ's universe as I listened to The Eye of the World. I became engrossed in the struggles between the shadow and light so much that I searched for ways to spend time alone so I could \\"read\\" more.  I listened to the novels as I ran miles around my town preparing for my first marathon. I listened to them as I tore my house down to the studs and rebuilt it for my wife and new baby daughter. I listened to them as I flew back and forth across the country for work. A lot of good memories float to the surface every time I think of this series and I give partial credit to them for my recovery.<br /><br />To take a word from Thom Merrilin, the last battle was \\"exquisite\\". A Memory of Light delivered on all of its promises. It is packed with action. It tied up all the many loose ends. It brought about an ending. Robert Jordan can now rest as his tale has been told. His memory has become legend.<br /><br />A Memory of Light has so many plots! On the surface it might seem a daunting task to read and keep track of them all, but Brandon Sanderson groups them together so you're not following too much at once. The world is in utter chaos and all the main characters have crucial roles to play. No one of them has a task more important than another, save maybe Rand himself. As Rand prepares for the final battle, he uses all the assets at his disposal. After setting them in play he leaves them to their own successes and failures as he finally sets out to confront the dark one.<br /><br />You begin to wonder as the shadow pushes back, how can the light prevail? The world is being torn apart by the dark one as he attempts to break the great wheel. Cracks that fall away into the void of nothingness, bubbles of evil erupting across the lands, and forsaken permanently burning souls from the pattern with balefire all plague the armies of the light. Slowly the pieces slide together as all the many loose ends from the previous thirteen books are gathered together into one final weave. Heroes fight, friends are lost and forsaken are left behind as the third age comes to a close.<br /><br />Brandon's writing mimics Robert Jordan's very well, though he writes with a youthful flourish that adds new life into an aging story. I hadn't known of Brandon prior to this venture of wearing the dragon pin so proudly. Since then I have read almost all of his work and wholeheartedly recommend him. A Memory of Light does not fall short of his standard.<br /><br />Throughout the three final volumes, the characters have all remained true to Robert Jordan's telling. Our farm-boy heroes have all grown up over the course of their adventures, yet they remain themselves. Matrim Cauthon is still the same gambler he has always been, though he is much more calculating now. Perrin remains the most level headed of the three ta'veren and Rand's insanity has given way to a clear head that is needed for the final battle.<br /><br />If you don't already know, the magic system within the Wheel of Time series is one of the best known in the fantasy genre. It is defined almost scientifically with advantages and dangers to its useand with opposite forces for every action. Not only is it soundly structured, it is also artful in its casting and the descriptions of its outcomes are both beautiful and ferocious. Aside from the primary magic system within the world, the pattern of existence itself grants new mystical abilities to heroes and villains to add balance and uncertainty to the stories.<br /><br />The world within the Wheel of Time is one of opposites. Villains are almost always evil and heroes are good. There are some minor exceptions, but this is not your gritty fantasy filled with anti-heroes. At its heart, this is your \\"farm-boy grows up and saves the world\\" fantasy story.<br /><br />I don't know how \\"original\\" A Memory of Light was. I certainly haven't read many books with such a wide scope, but most of the elements within the story were previously seen. There were a few new bits and pieces, but this story was more about concluding the legacy than about surprising us with new notions.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed A Memory of Light. It was a fitting end to one of the greatest epic fantasy series to date. I'd probably have liked it even more if it hadn't been so long, but the length served the purpose of wrapping up loose ends. It truly was unavoidable - there were so many. I also felt the ending would have been more powerful if a few more heroes hadn't survived into the fourth age. That isn't to say I didn't tear up at their survivals. How could I not? The Wheel of Time has come to an ending.<br /><br />I \\"read\\" this entire series via audiobook, the final volume being no exception. Kate Reading and Michael Kramer have practically become two of my best friends now, though I've never met or even talked with either of them.<br /><br />I'm torn between four and five stars. I think the telling by Brandon definitely deserves the full five rating, but the \\"farm-boy saves the world\\" story has been done quite a bit. This is a really good story though and one that has earned its place in history.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan for this epic series and for having the humility to allow another to finish your tale. Thank you Brandon Sanderson for completing this work with the grace only few have. Thank you Harriet for having the will to see your husband's work completed - you made an excellent choice.and with opposite forces for every action. Not only is it soundly structured, it is also artful in its casting and the descriptions of its outcomes are both beautiful and ferocious. Aside from the primary magic system within the world, the pattern of existence itself grants new mystical abilities to heroes and villains to add balance and uncertainty to the stories.<br /><br />The world within the Wheel of Time is one of opposites. Villains are almost always evil and heroes are good. There are some minor exceptions, but this is not your gritty fantasy filled with anti-heroes. At its heart, this is your \\"farm-boy grows up and saves the world\\" fantasy story.<br /><br />I don't know how \\"original\\" A Memory of Light was. I certainly haven't read many books with such a wide scope, but most of the elements within the story were previously seen. There were a few new bits and pieces, but this story was more about concluding the legacy than about surprising us with new notions.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed A Memory of Light. It was a fitting end to one of the greatest epic fantasy series to date. I'd probably have liked it even more if it hadn't been so long, but the length served the purpose of wrapping up loose ends. It truly was unavoidable - there were so many. I also felt the ending would have been more powerful if a few more heroes hadn't survived into the fourth age. That isn't to say I didn't tear up at their survivals. How could I not? The Wheel of Time has come to an ending.<br /><br />I \\"read\\" this entire series via audiobook, the final volume being no exception. Kate Reading and Michael Kramer have practically become two of my best friends now, though I've never met or even talked with either of them.<br /><br />I'm torn between four and five stars. I think the telling by Brandon definitely deserves the full five rating, but the \\"farm-boy saves the world\\" story has been done quite a bit. This is a really good story though and one that has earned its place in history.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan for this epic series and for having the humility to allow another to finish your tale.

B00003CWPL|1|SO THIS IS DAVID LYNCH'S DIRECTORIAL DEBUT.  MY IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS NOW I HAVE A NEW MOVIE  TO PUT ON MY LIST OF THE TEN WORST EVER MADE.  IT IS COMPLETELY NONSENSICAL, VIRTUALLY UNWATCHABLE.  IT IS GROSS AND VULGAR, WITH NO REDEEMING VALUE.  IF THERE IS A MESSAGE, IT IS LOST AMONGST THE  MOST VILE SCREEN IMAGES I HAVE EVER SEEN.  COMPARE THIS ABOMINATION TO THE DIRECTORIAL  DEBUT OF DARREN ARONOFSKY. HIS FIRST MOVIE, PI,  PUTS LYNCH TO SHAME.  IT IS INVENTIVE, MEMORABLE, WITH IMAGES AND MESSAGES,  THAT SPEAK OF THE INHERENT TALENT OF THE DIRECTOR  AND PORTENDS THE GOOD THINGS TO COME.  CAN YOU THEN COMPARE THE TWO DIRECTORS?  YES. ONE IS NOW RECOGNIZED AS A MAJOR NEW TALENT  WHO MUST BE RECKONED WITH IN THE FUTURE.  THE OTHER IS A DIRECTOR WHOSE TRUE COLORS WERE  READILY APPARENT IN HIS FIRST MOVIE.(NO PUN INTENDED)  DR SCOTT

B000002A3T|3|Though it includes three original members, this group of musicians is no substitute for Pink Floyd. They might appear as them in name, but in sound and spirit this is another band, entirely. Pink Floyd was a very particular approach - a very special attitude - that could be sensed, intuited, within every composition. Pink Floyd music was created out of a spirit of defiance. It might have been a reluctance, a fear, a terror of being boring. The Pink Floyd sound was always challenging, always inventive, always extremely creative. You were always being taken on a fantastical voyage, even when things got very nasty between the old boys. This new stand-in group, these impostors, this new imitation has absolutely none of that. This Pink Floyd produces simple songs, but not wondrous magic.<br /><br />On \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" some vestigial Floyd juice had trickled into the mix, there's moments when you can actually hear a trace of their former greatness. Probably was Roger Waters' voice echoing around inside Gilmour's head. But this new \\"Pink\\" was just so limp, so flaccid compared to their might of times yore. There was no fire, no rage, no conviction. They even stoop to plagiarizing themselves with the very lame \\"A New Machine, parts 1 & 2\\". A couple clever sound effects and Gilmour's semi-rigid guitar jabs does not equal Floyd.<br /><br />So on the \\"Division Bell\\" it's even more ridiculous. There's a saying \\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\\" Also important to note that you can't teach a dog to fly a rocket. The real Pink Floyd were valiant test pilots on constant missions to the deepest recesses of inner space. This \\"group\\" prefers to not venture any further than the over sized swimming pools in their own back yards. They are floating around on comfy inflatable recliner chairs, sipping gin and tonics and occasionally making sarcastic bitter jokes about the old glory days. It's just way too depressing to bear. Get me my BB gun so I can deflate this tragic pool party.<br /><br />I know that Roger Waters is sorry for the way he behaved all through their messy divorce, and of late has usually been the first of the bunch to consent to any sort of reunion, but Gilmour is still defensive. He is reluctant to tread that old trail, afraid of where it might lead, what it might reveal. He's probably most fearful of finding himself - angry, bitter, sad, and confused. You know, that's likely a good place from which to launch a new band. If they ever manage to mount that expedition, I'm sure it'll have some amazing destinations dialed into the controls.I know that Roger Waters is sorry for the way he behaved all through their messy divorce, and of late has usually been the first of the bunch to consent to any sort of reunion, but Gilmour is still defensive.

B00DPM7TIG|5|If you like historical fiction, you will love this book.  It's a different twist on a World War Two tale.  Told from the perspective of a young blind girl in Paris and a young orphan boy in Germany, you see how many different people were victims of the Nazis.  This would be a great read for a book club, as it would inspire a great discussion.

I am not sure that I will get the next. My favorite so far was Songs about Jane. If you don't mind all the tampering, the album is decent to listen to.

B000005RU2|4|I loved this album back in 1972 and I'm still amazed by it's sonic impact today. Deep Purple's recording engineer Martin Burch was asked to capture some shows from the 1972 Machine Head Tour on tape. During the August 1972 Japanese leg of the tour, he had his chance to record. Burch was supplied with an unimpressive, cheap looking Ampex 8-track recorder to get the job done. Burch was dissapointed with the equipment he was given and was certain that the results would be a total waste of his time.  <br />When the entourage arrived back in England, Burch took the time to throw the eight track recording tapes onto a studio deck and have a listen. COMPLETE AND TOTAL SHOCK !!! The combination of skillful microphone placement, concert hall acoustics and the unexpected superior performance of that little Ampex tape deck had collectively ganged up to capture one of the finest quality live rock recordings of all time.  <br />
B007CIQ4B2|5|As someone who appreciates well crafted musicianship from serious singer/songwriters, Ben Howard is now near the very top of my list along side David Gray, Nick Drake, Fink and the John Butler Trio. And you'll hear slight influences of all of them in this album. I can't remember the last time an album literally transported me into another realm.<br /><br />\\"Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags,<br />I've come to know that memories<br />Were the best things you ever had<br />The summer shone beat down on bony backs<br />So far from home where the ocean stood<br />Down dust and pine cone tracks\\"<br /><br />You can smell the ocean air and feel the pine cones beneath your bare feet. I played this album in the background while I worked and found I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing, I kept drifting off to the ocean, the woods, teenage memories of camping out with friends who you would eventually lose touch with. It's simply an outstanding collection of songs.<br /><br />It took me hours to get to the last track because I kept replaying the first three songs. This album will remain in my playlist for many months to come. And at only 23 years old, I can't even fathom how Ben's music will evolve in the coming years.<br /><br />Buy two copies of this album and send one to that old friend you used to camp on the beach with, the one you lost touch with so long ago.
B001OQCV6K|4|SHERLOCK HOLMES<br /><br />STARRING: Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, Mark Strong, Eddie Marsan, Robert Maillet and Kelly Reilly<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, Simon Kinberg and Lionel Wigram; based on the characters created by Arthur Conan Doyle<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Guy Ritchie<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Mystery<br />Release Date: 25 December 2009<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is back! Thanks to his blessing as Tony Stark in Iron Man, he's catapulted himself to A-list status. He's recently blown us away with his Oscar nominated performance in Tropic Thunder, and his highly underrated portrayal in The Soloist. Now, he returns to take our breath away yet again, as the amazing Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />I'm not gonna lie; I am not familiar with the character of Sherlock Holmes at all, despite him having been depicted probably more than any character we know of. That includes favorites such as James Bond and Ebenezer Scrooge. According to [...], Holmes has appeared in well over 200 television and cinematic projects; the first of which dates all the way back to 1905. That's impressive. I have no idea if this movie lives up to what fans of the character and the novels would expect. But I enjoyed the film a great deal. I simply saw it due to the actors involved in the project. Ok, I'm a bit of a Guy Ritchie fan as well - but who isn't?<br /><br />The film is undoubtedly an obnoxious action flick that may annoy many. It has a bit of humor, and a great deal of mystery to it as well, but it's the action-junkies that will get the most from it. Unfortunately, I suspect that is also what will ruin it for some; particularly those expecting it to be more of a subtle mystery.<br /><br />I'm just a sucker for good action movies and so long as the actors are magnificent, I'm willing to look past a somewhat weak story. Sherlock Holmes was exactly that for me. It moves very fast and at times you may be off track by what is going on. What's great however is Holmes will often catch you back up to pace with things you might have missed, using well-narrated flashbacks and comedic one-liners.<br /><br />The plot could have been better, but then again it certainly could have been worse. We meet a nasty villain early on in the film by the name of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). He's a tyrant who practices in the dark arts. Holmes and his faithful sidekick Watson (Jude Law) take him down in the first few minutes, and he is put to death by hanging. Due to his dark trade, he magically comes back to life to wreak havoc on the people of London once again. Somewhat bitter by his un-expected return from the grave, Holmes and Watson are eager to take the case and catch him a second time.<br /><br />Downey and Law are brilliant together and you get the feeling they have known each other for years. They go together like peanut butter and jelly or Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller.<br /><br />Law plays Watson very well and is everything you would want a sidekick to be. And Downey was definitely snubbed out of an Oscar nomination for his performance as Holmes. His accent is perfected to a T and his Sherlock persona is more than impressive and highly entertaining. At least he took home the Golden Globe.<br /><br />I was disappointed to see some of the scenes with Rachel McAdams that we saw in the trailer, sadly removed from the theatrical version of the film. Maybe they will show up on the DVD and BLU-RAY discs. She was wonderful as always, as Holmes' love interest, Irene.<br /><br />The look and feel of the film reminded me a great deal of the phenomenal horror / thriller From Hell. Director Guy Ritchie has given Holmes a playground amidst the streets of an eerie London that looks like it could easily be housing Jack the Ripper. It's not too dark though; the brilliant Academy Award nominated score makes the setting less sinister.<br /><br />Ritchie did a terrific job directing this film. His cinematography is very detailed and every shot looks like a million bucks. The `guy' (no pun intended) has an eccentric vision. The fight sequences are awesome and are among the best I've seen since Fight Club or the Jason Bourne movies. He uses some computer graphics, but only where he needed to and they look amazing. He's not afraid to use them in wide shots, that fill nearly the entire frame and that takes guts.<br /><br />If it's not too much to ask, I have only one request for the currently untitled sequel that is to be released sometime in 2011 (with Brad Pitt rumored to be co-starring). I'd like very much to see Watson at some point in the film say to Holmes, \\"Well no s*** Sherlock.\\" Would that be too much? I think it would be swell.) has an eccentric vision.

B008L1DNGI|4|to my Dreamcast days, Love the game but I never really played it for single player, This was the first Dreamcast game to have online play and that's where I spent many hours. Wish this had online play but I also miss playing this with a controller, but for a phone app game it does well.
B003UYUR10|5|Fun, exciting, educational.
B00E9A656K|4|the problem is the fact that you cant sell cars. otherwise itd be a top notch game. make that an option please.
B00JB3MVCW|1|Poor acting. Plot is flaky and provokes many sighs.
B00BH0VSM6|3|I liked the author and the story was pretty good,but lets face it, when can we get a detective character who is a decent and squared away guy who can be in a committed relationship and still function in the real world?  If that is all novelists think that detectives are like? Maybe they should do a little more research.  It just gets a little tired always the tortured detective that has a barely functioning personal life and can be so good at finding criminals.
B0029VT3UQ|4|The movie haunted me for several days.  Sad but also positive to watch the development and growth of the protagonist.

0374531269|3|A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah is a heartbreaking account of Beah's time as a boy soldier. I did not particularly enjoy this memoir; however, Beah does a great job describing hardship that occurred during Sierra Leone's Civil War. I believe this book is an eye-opener regarding child soldiers. Living in America, it is sometimes hard to believe that there is even such a thing as a child solider. This book shows a culture that I was not previously very familiar with. Something that could not escape my mind while reading this book, is that one of the reasons that Beah had to experience a lot of what he went through is because of the globalization of diamonds. Even though diamonds are not the only cause, it is a huge factor that plays part. Once diamonds were found in Sierra Leone they became a huge factor leading up to the war. Harvesting and selling diamonds lead to the money that helped purchase the weapons and ammo that was used at this time. It is really sad and unfortunate to think that globalization could have such a huge impact on so many lives, especially so many children similar to Ishmael Beah.

I bought 3 more of Google Chormcast for my relative and will plan to by the other 3 more for my best friends.

B00D3PYQT0|5|Up until two months ago hadn't even viewed Downton Abbey.  Have heard much about the series but for whatever reason hadn't tuned in.  First went to local library and checked out the first season.  As soon as I popped the first disc into the recorder, I was hooked. The characters are so true and real to the person(s) they are portraying. Love the early vintage clothing.  Last but not least, the magnificent Downton Abbey estate.  The story just moves along, pulls you at once into the program and the characters.  After viewing all four seasons, I immediately went to Amazon to see if I could make a purchase as this series is something to have and hand down to my grandchildren.  I'm excited to view the upcoming series in January 2015.<br /><br />I enjoyed how the series doesn't just focus on the Abbey family but the staff/servants as well because each one of them has a story in their own to share because each one holds a certain status in the Downton Abbey famly.

B00JAQJMJ0|3|I keep reading that a person either loves Wes Anderson's films or hates them. I guess I'm the exception to that rule as I liked this but didn't love it.  What I did love was the story, which was actually a moving tale about the relationship of an older concierge with his protegee.  I also loved the era, of the grand old hotels in Europe between the wars.  The cast was uniformly good, especially Ralph Fiennes.  The sets and locales were wonderful to look at.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film a lot until the great escape sequence, which was too long and way overly clever.  I started to yawn and wonder when the film would be over.  The end wound things up in a nice way so i didn't leave the theater unhappy.  I think that the director just got too carried away with his own sense of cleverness.  He needs a stricter editor, but since he has already convinced lots of people he's great, he'll probably never get one.<br /><br />As another reviwer stated, there are a lot of people who consider themselves special because they love to love Wes Anderson's films.  If you are one of them, then go for it.
B0026OR2PE|3|Having first read &#34;A year without pants&#34; by Scott Berkun, I could not give this the same rating. A though provoking book, but just as it gains momentum I though it left one handing. Regardless, working for a company who wants to be seen an innovative, the lessons & myths in this book ring true to my own work life.
B004XZR63M|5|This book is an easy to understand book, offering the base to change your way of thinking about money.<br />I would recommend to anyone.
B00E8S2JZ4|5|The extended cut added important minutes that round out the story and provide needed additional character development. I would say this version would help those new to the story line better understand what is happening a little better, and those very familiar with the story a nice added treat.

0385512058|5|The title of this book is what captured my attention. The passion with which it was written captured my enthusiasm. The author, Keith Ferrazzi, is a marketing expert and networking fanatic. If you only do half of the things that he does in this book, you will dramatically increase your networking skills. The underlying message, and a repetitive theme of this book, is that networking is not about getting; it's about giving - giving people what they need to succeed. In doing so, he believes that you build solid relationships that will be both beneficial and rewarding. He doesn't just give advice, he gives you detailed instruction while  offering real-life examples of how he befriended prominent, well-respected and accomplished business leaders in the process. Many of these relationships were instigated, enhanced, or solidified over a meal - during which time he could fervently express his hunger to help another succeed; thus the creation of the title. It's a great concept, a winning formula and the best book I've ever read on networking. Buy it today!
B00BD99JMW|3|\\"Allegiant\\" is the third and final novel in Veronica Roth's \\"Divergent\\" trilogy. The series is set in the near future, taking place in a dystopian society that is governed by \\"factions.\\" These five factions are Abnegation, Amity, Dauntless, Candor, and Erudite. Each faction favors a different set of values, and when a person reaches the age of 16 they are able to choose among the five factions. They call this the \\"Choosing Ceremony\\" and it is at this time in Beatrice Prior's life that we are introduced to her in the novel \\"Divergent.\\"<br />I loved \\"Divergent.\\" I thought it was an excellent novel with plenty of action, a good amount of romance, and an intriguing mystery that kept me turning the pages. I went through the same things as I read through the second novel, \\"Insurgent.\\" \\"Allegiant,\\" however, was a different story altogether. It seemed to me as if Roth just wanted to finish the series as quickly as possible. We discover the big reason of why the world is the way it is only 100 pages into the book, which was kind of a let down for me. The romance between Tris and Tobias is way overdone, I found myself skimming through a lot of the dialogue between them. Towards the middle of the novel it slows down as Tris begins to discover more about the mystery surrounding her family. The end of the book was anticlimactic in my opinion, and I believe it could have been done a little better. Roth had a lot of potential to take \\"Allegiant\\" in a different direction, and I'm sad that she didn't. Overall the book wasn't what I expected, but I still enjoyed it. If you enjoyed the first two books I'm sure you'll enjoy this one, but be prepared for drawn-out romance, a few let downs, but an overall enjoyable book.
B00008EY9G|2|It's not schizophrenia in this movie, it's multiple personality disorder, which apparently affected the script.  Although John Cusack's always watchable and the \\"trapped strangers\\" plot usually rustles up some general creepiness, this movie could have been a lot better even with a flawed premise.
B00GX59QO2|1|This loosely connected series of scenes including cars blowing up being hurled in the air was ridiculously  lame and only slightly amusing. The humor  was mainly,&#34;Good grief, can't believe I'm still watching this!&#34; LOL
B00A6CCF0K|5|King is still the King of Horror. This sequel to The Shining is destine to be a classic in its own right.<br /><br />Catching up with Dan now that he has grown up was like finding on old friend. Sure he's got problems, BIG problems, but our connection to him is strong. After all, we knew him as a little boy with a very scary gift and an even scarier father.<br /><br />Dan's inherited his father's problems, but we really want him to beat that monkey off his back and into submission. Now he has an additional problem. There is a little girl born with the same gift/curse he has attempted to quiet with booze reaching out to him.<br /><br />Reluctantly, he must reach out to save her, himself and possible the world as we think we know it. This book is perfectly King. Small bits of horror fed to us before we know it is too late to turn away from the addiction of his words. I loved every minute, every word from this brilliant author.

B0009KA7BS|1|So bad its funny adaptation of the Comic book Hellblazer is such a multi-car wreck that it's almost too bad to watch.  Keanu Reeves is so bad in the role that he should be a comedian instead of an actor because almost all of his scenes in this film are funny. His deliveries of his lines are so bad that you can come up with better lines before he's able to say the dialog. He demeanor borders on stupidly and he's even upstage by the special effects, which are not very good to begin with.  It also does not help when you have a script that is so unfocused and so badly written that you as a audience member can't suspend disbelief on what is going on right in front of you while you are watching it. It's tries to be a cool version of the Exorcist but ends up being more like John Water's Pink Flamingoes but with out the camp or the humor that movie had. There is a transsexual angel that causes the horrible climax of the movie to happen and a homosexual demon that has a grudge with our dumb hero but by the time we are introduce to him, almost everybody in the audience would have a personal grudge against Keanu character for how bad the movie has turn out.  <br /> <br />Surpassingly, there is some good to be found in this film and that's mainly coming from the performance of Rachel Weisz, who is so good in this film that you end up wondering on why the movie turn out so bad in the first place.  Weisz is such a strong and talented actor that she even kinds of makes you buy on what is going on with the story but that's a uphill battle even for her great talent to succeed giving the fact that her co-star can't act if his life depended on it and the fact that the screenplay does not do her performance any justice. She's the only rose in this big pile of crap that is worth watching and that's pretty sad considering the fact that if you had a screenplay and a leading man to compliment her performance, this movie would have been much better off that it is now.  <br />
B0071XO8RA|5|Where do I begin....I really don't know how to put my feelings about Wool into words. The Wool series is simply a masterpiece. A refreshingly original masterpiece. I think that the best way to describe Wool is to call it a roller-coaster ride. The book's biggest strength is how unpredictable the story is. You will NOT see Hugh Howey's literary thunderbolts coming. Absolutely EVERY single Wool (parts 1-5) has a shocking twist and ending. At one point, EVERY single chapter blew my mind, shattered it into a million pieces and left me questioning my existence. The Wool series is THAT good. It is amazing how consistently Hugh Howey manages to turn the story upside down without it getting tiresome. The book was impossible to put down because this. After a while, you simply know that the more you read, the better the story gets. Hugh Howey simply does not lift his foot of the pedal for a single second. The Wool series is a refreshingly original, intriguing, amazing and mind blowing story.    I can't wait for more Wool books, I will be one of the first to buy them for sure! Also, I simply can't wait for the inevitable movie release of Wool. The story would translate extremely well onto the big screen and if done right, it will surely become a classic just as the books surely will.    P.S You can go to Hugh Howey's website [...] and order SIGNED copies of the books! Just imagine yourself a few years from now. Hugh Howey is an award-winning author, the Wool series is a worldwide sensation heralded by literary critics and labelled as a classic, the movie adaptation has just won an Oscar for Best Picture. And you will be there, holding a signed copy of Wool, by the man himself, Hugh Howey.

0143038419|3|Somehow, I was expecting more from this book, given the ecstatic raves the critics gave it and the number of five star reviews on this site.  Whilst I think the book is well structured, I felt deflated and somewhat disappointed when I finished it.    I never really got a handle on why Ms Gilbert felt so stifled and unhappy in her marriage.  I do not understand why she was plunged into such agonising depths of despair over the thought of giving her husband, who presumably she loved, a child.  Had she not given any thought to an issue of this magnitude during the eight years of their marriage???  It seems odd to me that the marriage collapsed in such a bitter manner over that, so bitter that she willingly signed over all of her assets to her ex out of guilt.  I suspect there is more to this than was admitted, given how quickly she took up with David after she separated from her husband.  She barely drew a breath before she began a full-blown relationship with him.    Of the three parts of the book, I enjoyed her accounts of living in Italy and Indonesia the most, but I was bored to sobs by the section on living in the Ashram in Southern India.  I persevered and read all of that segment, but was left unmoved by it as Eastern mysticism leaves me somewhat cold, so all the talk about her \\"Guru\\", Sanskrit chants, etc fell very flat with me.      Like other reviewers, I suspect a number of the characters were completely made up, ie Luca Spaghetti (????!!!), her Italian language buddy, who wouldn't you know it, was hot, and had an equally hot twin brother to boot; Richard the aphorism sprouting Texan at the Ashram was just too down home folksy to be true and who famously nicknamed the author \\"Groceries\\" due to her supposedly emaciated state.  Groceries?????? GROCERIES?????? and let's not forget Tutti, the 8-year-old Indonesian girl who taught herself to speak perfect English solely from reading books.  Come on - she'd have to be a genius on par with Einstein to do that at such a young age.      Overall, I think the book was well-written, but I was irritated by the author's underlying narcissism, and I found much in the book unrealistic.  Everything in her sabbatical year turned out perfectly - seriously, how often does that happen in real life?  I guess when one has received a book advance of a couple of hundred thousand dollars, the odds of a year long overseas trip going simply swimmingly are greatly enhanced.       The book openly panders to a number of cliched, middle-aged female escape fantasies, i.e: ditching a husband one is bored with; taking up with a hot young thing in a passionate, torrid affair a nanosecond after ditching aforementioned boring husband; taking off overseas for a year to \\"find yourself\\" and ultimately winding up in a new relationship with a hot man with a cute accent who of course, is Latin.  Pardon me for my cynicism, but the book read like a film script in that sense. Oh wait, it is being made into a film as we speak.  Ms Gilbert's spiritual journey was not one that I was able to really relate to. I did not find anything she wrote particulary insightful or profound on a spiritual level. I've given it three stars, but that is a star too generous.  Easy enough to read, but most definitely does NOT live up to the hype.
B00C8S9W0G|5|this was a smooth read. weaving in previous characters wonderfully. ending leaves just enough for the possibility for book 9 to take right up on
B00992CF6W|4|Omg!I have been looking for a great and fun app that is time consuming,and in minecraft that was exactly what I got!u can build homes,farms,structures and ext.if you haven't already down loaded this app u totally should:)
B0063IH60K|5|works great. I had no problems with it what so ever. new favourite game on my kindle. like it a lot
B00957T6X6|5|Before this series I believed nothing in the genre could ever touch LotR. Since I can tolerate and enjoy the level of brutality, sex, blood, and gore, this work is easily as detailed engaging and enjoyable as anything Tolkien ever did.<br /><br />The character development, all story lines, and indeed ALL other aspects of a good story are done excellently! If you don't read these books, you cannot claim to have read the best fantasy fiction ever.<br /><br />Only negative: Book 5 leaves you hanging ... come on George, publish the rest already!
B001CQGZNW|1|There are \\"non-explicit\\" versions of some of the more popular tracks, but the censoring of them was done worse then the standard radio mix.      Don't buy this version.
044654759X|3|2.5 rounded up     It's not so much that there is anything bad about this book, it is just that it is.... boring. A very large portion of the story is devoted to describing the day to day life of the characters who live in a small, seaside town. What one does as they get up, what they eat, how they cook, the routine conversations between family members, what they buy at the grocery store, which tablecloth to put out etc. etc., comprises not only most of the book, but each of our own daily lives. While familiar, it's NOT what most sit down to read about. We all live it. It doesn't need to be endlessly explained.  We KNOW already! Most people choose to read for an escape from the workaday life, not to re-hash it. That, along with the over-the-top climax makes this a rather disappointing attempt by a talented author
B00L2D38VW|5|The puzzles are challenging and the bridge building is fun. I enjoy playing this game every day.
B008602KQI|3|Good story although a bit predictable. Jennifer Lawrence played her role believably; a good action and romantic film at the same time.
0345803507|1|The entire series is repetitive. Lacks any kind of depth. Even the sex is repetitive . The first book is 2.5 stars the rest not worthy of reading
B00T3DNKIE|3|I was very disappointed In the book. It just seemed to be a rough bio of Jean Louise and very little to do with Atticus, my hero. The book had too much rambling and at times was even boring reading. I will take To Kill a Mockingbird any day.
B00I8H65E2|3|Didn't do justice to Diana. The actress tried to portray all of Diana's mannerisms, but she seemed to overplay them, and didn't look like Diana
0307592731|5|Cheryl  Strayed is one of my favorite authors.  I purchased this book for my granddaughter as it was a beautiful, from-the-heart memoir of a young woman attempting to resolve and overcome and understand personal conflicts, struggles, and issues.  Her physical struggle on the Pacific Crest Trail was equal to her inner struggles and she overcame both with such inner strength, courage and heart.
B00DHKKN6Q|3|Fun for kids. Some of the levels are a little to hard for the kids so adults have to complete the levels for them other wise good
B0031YJFCQ|4|Very good ending to the series of good.  Keeps you on the end of your seat.  Can't put down book.  Makes you wish there was more the the series.
B006CUDDUG|5|Still stands up as the best cold war spy novel ever.
B009LA1QW6|5|Veryyy chill album. This is the musical side compared to Born to Die. Definitely a more sloww, darker tone. No song has a &#34;hip&#34; &#34;upbeat&#34; feel like Born to Die but still a nice album.
B008JGSM6G|5|A great logic game.  Not always as easy as you would think!  It takes some thought on the higher levels.  Glad I got it.
B0095ZQ36G|5|Morality  triumphs over warfare in this spellbinding work. The reader is immediately engrossed in a tale of facts interwoven with emotions both happy and sad. Highly recommended!
B002KV4NTQ|5|Always one of my faves. The last of the big three. Beggars, Bleed and Sticky!<br />Those three are all way better than Exile.
B00ASVX1BQ|5|5 stars all the way around here. An audio/visual delight to watch & listen to. I enjoyed it immensely, it's the kind of bluray that makes me glad I bought a home theater. Gawd, this woman can sing!
B005GFPZYK|5|An honest story of the sacrifices and challenges that war and service bring to home. Thank you Kyle for sharing your story. Thank you for service to our country. Rest In Peace brother.
0385349947|5|The \\"Mommy Wars\\" have been raging since feminists embraced the old Virignia Slims ad line \\"You've Come A Long Way, Baby.\\" What mothers really know that is none of their choices are easy: Work full-time, stay at home, work part-time. No one has come up with the solution for a mother to \\"have it all.\\"  Sandberg, COO of Facebook, is no different.  In Lean In, she never says that she has THE answer.  She simply offers ideas - practical ideas for women, in any walk of life, quite frankly, who can take the very real behaviors that women have traditionally demonstrated (She uses empirical data here - it is fascinating) - and, if they wish, change their outcomes.<br /><br /> Sandberg's message is not an easy one to hear. And with any uncomfortable message, she is sure to get criticism.  There have already been accusations such as, \\"Ms Sandberg, you are an elite woman of means, other women can't do what you do...\\" Hogwash!  Sandberg specifically says that all women can not do what she does.  However, I suggest readers and potential readers stop clouding the issue with such nonsense and listen to her message.  And for the record, in the the US, every woman has at her disposal all the education she needs to become as successful as Sandberg...we all can not do it, obviously, but if we would all like to work as hard as she does, the options are there. I believe that is the message Sandberg is trying to share - to simply keep moving forward and not back away, see what could possibly happen.<br /><br />If you would like to get some background as to how women got where they are and some practical yet innovative, new ideas for how to be more successful in the future - heck, the strategies are terrific for any relationship - this is a book that may be useful.  For example, Sandberg points out that women traditionally are not so good at negotiating, this is a skill Sandberg learned as well.  I, for one, could use her advice on how to better negotiate, even in my small business.  There is a wealth of information here for women. Sandberg's overall message is a good one, too, namely, wouldn't it be nice of both woman and men, if they so desire, could have the ability to both contribute at home and at work?  This is not a new sentiment, Ann Crittenden had the same desires, as have millions of women between then and now, in her book The Price of Motherhood in 2001.  Please do not shoot the messenger and read the book, you just must learn something!is a wealth of information here for women.

B005PK57IK|5|Great series !
B0054JZC6E|5|grate game... a little grindy though but over all a good time waster. fun to play a lot of mingames to play. again  a grate game to play
B00DR0PDNE|5|I used this for desktop sharing and Netflix (My Sony TV is horrible with Netflix, so this was a great solution to replace the built in function of the TV).<br /><br />Cons: Your computer needs to be recent to stream 1080, my older laptops can't stream 1080 to the TV<br />Cons: Amazon Prime does not work with this<br /><br />Pros: Cheap/Easy to use
B002ZB26AO|5|With all the recent media attention on North Korea and Kim Jong-un, this book gives marvelous insight into what is REALLY going on. I've learned about what it really means to live in a state-run totalitarian regime. This is like a real life 1984.
B00BLCHZC2|1|too slow, Game of Thrones much better
B00GFCMHHG|5|Great tour by the band. Sound quality is excellent. The addition of the string ensemble on this tour was great.
630575067X|4|Don't get me wrong.  I loved this movie - I saw it five times in the theaters.  But the one thing that really bothered me was the character of Jar Jar.  I realize the movie was intended for a younger audience than has become Star Wars' following...but Jar Jar was too much with his silly pig latin talk and just plain stupidity.  I didn't think he added to the plot at all.<br />What I was very impressed with was the end, how there were so many things going on at once (three? four? different large events) and they were all followable and linked and made sense.  I also thought the casting was fantastic.  Ewan McGregor made a totally believeable young Obi-Wan, and while we obviously had never met an older Qui-Gonn Jinn, Liam Neeson was wonderful in the role he played.  And little Jake Lloyd had the perfect look for Anakin; young, innocent, charming, but with a quiet intelligence and intensity that spoke volumes of his abilities.<br />Did anyone else find the explanation for the Metichlorians (sp) to be rather trivial and silly?  I really didn't like it at all. I'd tend to think of the Force as being something metaphysical - not something you can quantify by taking a blood sample.  That and Jar Jar were my main complaints.  Other than that, what a FANTASTIC movie!  Have four years passed yet????
B00BD99JMW|2|I wasn't impressed with this book. I loved book one, book two was ok and this one was boring. I didn't like the change in character voices- since it wasn't used previously. However I did appreciate that Tris did finally die! It made it more realistic, not the typical happily ever after!
B00005JNPZ|5|Hi, yes, this movie uses the typical 3 point holywood script, and is predictable. But it is very good entertainment. <br /> <br />The three lead actors do an incredible job of portraying in a comical way what most of us go through and would do to meet the person of our dreams to spend our life with. <br />
0062080237|3|I can't say that this was a great product or a poor product.  My nephew had it on his Christmas list and I thought the plot rather intriguing so I purchased it.  However, another family member had already purchased  a different gift so I returned it.
B00BD62X14|3|Former first lady of France has a lovely voice but it was not showcased properly in these songs.<br />  It is an album that perhaps will grow on you in time.<br />I think a bigger sound with an orchestra would suit her better singing Edith Piaf classics.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Loved this book! Entertaining and a great mystery. I felt like I was right there.
B005MLOKXA|5|Just started watching this year - catching up.  guest stars awesome. however too many contrived time constraints in courtroom scenes. Eli is great!
B008MEM24S|5|This game is the best.  I was able to do ALL the levels. Spend 99 cents on this game, it's worth it.
B00U7VDC7A|3|Had to reload 3 times. Glitches galore in level 3. No response from customer support.
B00OKYQZDI|5|A very fun game.
B00004Y6NX|5|If this album kept up the quality of the first 4 songs (Tunnel Of Love, Romeo and Juliet, Skateaway and Expresso Love) - this would be one of the greatest albums of all times -BY ANYONE.  These short stories are so evocative and are performed so well - Roy Bittan fits like a glove after the departure of David Knophler.  The 3 other tracks are real good, good and OK.  But again - the first 4 are masterpieces. My favorite Dire Straits album and one of my favorites of all.
B008645YEE|5|I just like the movie and its music, so I bought this cd which really deserves a 4 or 5 stars. Powerful, inspiring and exciting music actually.
0307450570|5|fully admit it - I'm a big fan of Martha Stewart's crafting projects. I was given a subscription for Martha Stewart Living Magazine for Christmas a couple of years ago and have kept every issue. But that one year is just a fraction of what appears in this new release from Random House Canada. It covers 17 years of craft content from the magazine packed into 32 chapters!<br /><br />I have been reading (drooling over) Martha Stewart's Encyclopedia of Crafts for the last couple of weeks, savoring every last page (and there's over 400 pages!)<br /><br />Each craft has an overview, the supplies needed, very explicit step by step instructions and many projects incorporating the techniques. All are accompanied by absolutely gorgeous full colour photos.<br /><br />Many of the ideas presented are updated techniques on historical crafts such as candle making, soap making and quilling to name a few. Although some crafts may seem daunting on first view, they really aren't. I'm thinking of making candles for Christmas gifts next year. I could tin punch some holders for them. And then use stencilled gift wrap, stamped cards, origami boxes and calligraphic notes from other chapters to package them!<br /><br />I've enjoyed working with stained glass before, but haven't tried my hand at glass etching. There are some great ideas for starting small with tumblers and working your way up to mirrors and hanging pieces.<br /><br />Some of the ideas are so simple and yet so visually stunning. I loved the framed pressed botanicals. Sun prints were something I'd never heard of before. Using light sensitive paper, you burn the image in reverse and use it for a variety of designs.<br /><br />Some of the chapters use newer techniques. I'm a dedicated sewer and had a huge light bulb moment when I came to the chapter on polymer clay. Buttons! I've always purchased those cute crafty buttons to finish off a child's outfit, but I'm going to try making some of my own.<br /><br />I haven't even begun to touch on everything included in this truly encyclopedic book. There's beading, decoupage, gilding, mosaics, silk screening, wreaths and lots and lots more! There is a glossary in the back as well as templates and patterns for all the projects presented. I'm thrilled to have this book in my library.<br /><br />I'll post some pictures of finished projects - but for now, I am happily rereading this book - there's just so much to take in in one read.

B0060ZJ7BC|2|this film makes poor use of it's source material and is more focussed on portraying billy as emotional and egotistical than showing the work he actually did with stats. even without comparisons to the more cohesive faster paced book the generic \\"good dad\\" scenes are as cliched as they are irrelevant, and the scenes when players are being traded don't explain why he wants whichever players he wants, just a series of meaningless names said back and forth and then a victory cheer, and we're supposed to cheer with him like we know what was achieved? the director might as well have just made up some more fanciful fictional explanation for how billy found new players and made the fantasy baseball movie he really wanted to make where emotional outbursts and cocky one-liners are the more relevant hallmarks that define winners. the actual stock footage of the fan-made signs in the stands spanning the A's record breaking 20 win streak packed more punch than any of the fictional bluster. given the critical and popular reception though i can't argue with results. the director did give people what they wanted.
B000000OMB|3|From the reviews on this page, it seems people either adore or hate this album.  I'm somewhere in between.  When I was a youngun', this one loomed large on my radar, as it did for a horde of adolescent boys, what with its epic sounds and themes.  More importantly, it served as a gateway drug to the more serious prog bands.  I'd say that going from Asia to ELP and Belew-era King Crimson is well worth the inexpensive price of this album alone.<br /><br />The album certainly starts on a deliciously memorable note with \\"Heat of the Moment,\\" perhaps the only ballad in 10/4 time to ever top the charts.  I can never get sick of this one: Howe's mammoth guitar tone seems to encompass the world, John Wetton's vocals ooze regret and longing, Geoffrey Downes's synths bubble along sweetly, and of course Carl Palmer beats the drums silly while surrounding with you the echoes that the production adds.<br /><br />From here, it goes ever-so-gradually downhill.  The problem with this prog supergroup is that their public face, bassist/vocalist John Wetton, represents the least impressive era of his previous band's existence.  King Crimson was certainly impressive with him, but didn't have the same schizoid allure as they had with Greg Lake or Adrian Belew at the helm.  His stint with Crimson represents their poppiest in their almost forty years of existence.  Take Belew, Lake, or Jon Anderson, of Yes, say (tho' of course Asia would really be Yes with the latter) and have them singing and co-penning the songs and you wouldn't have an album that constantly flirts with vapidity.<br /><br />Which is what the album does more and more as one song heads into the next.  It's not about the musicianship, which always remains at a world-class level, it's about the tone of the compositions.  Their second single from the album, \\"Only Time Will Tell,\\" is certainly an enjoyable confection, but is just a little too sweet, making the listener think that perhaps too much of this stuff might rot the brain.  In its own way, that's fine, because this album is okay to put on once every year, much like one tends to have only have fruitcake once a year, making it enjoyable then and only then.  Compare this to a true prog masterpiece like Yes's _Close to the Edge_; the compulsion factor to listen to that one over and over again is palpable, as that confection is not whipped to a sugary froth; no, that one is shot through with dark chocolate, thick and dark with just the right amount of sugar to keep from overpowering the listener.<br /><br />Song three, \\"Sole Survivor,\\" is fun and flirts at the edge of rocking out, much like the rest of the album.  The only song that really rocks with what seems like reckless abandon is \\"Heat of the Moment,\\" where Palmer and Howe are \\"let off the leash\\" for a good time at the end (tho' of course the song fades out in the heat of the jam at the end, lest it be too long for radio).  The rest of the album is more restrained: my theory is that this is so because of Wetton's \\"English reserve.\\"  On bass, he may have the ability of a Chris Squire to cut loose and go into ozone-aiming trills and hammer-ons off the top of his head (tho' I doubt it), but he never does this.  His lyrics match this approach.  They are clever and evocative, but never hit the ecstatic pitch of abstraction and sheer nonsense that helps the lyrics of Jon Anderson and Greg Lake to put you in a completely other place.  This approach characterizes Wetton all the way back to his Crimson days.  For nine-tenths of this album, you know that you are precisely on earth, which is a little too much of the quotidian and a lot too little of the sublime for these ears.<br /><br />I could give you a blow-by-blow of the rest of the songs on this album, but I'm going to leave it up to you.  I think you should buy this album, but you've already heard the highlights if you listen to classic rock radio.  The rest of these songs are competent prog lite that serve well to put one in a slightly ornate and \\"just fine\\" kind of mood, good for cleaning the house, say.  If you're looking for a profound listening experience, though, this is not the place to go.  Go to the bands from whence the musicians here came; the pleasures that Crimson, ELP, and Yes offer in their primes are certainly not guilty ones.e in a slightly ornate and \\"just fine\\" kind of mood, good for cleaning the house, say.

B0073O0AME|3|The music was fun to listen to, however between each song was a long and ambiguous narrative. The narrative made it impossible to use the music as background music as it seem to constantly be interrupting the spirit and flow of the songs.
