B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love Scribblenauts! I just have one thing that I hate about these other guys who review a sucky game giving it 5 stars and saying it is the best game and s***. I am not happy with your ideas that you can get these people to play a game that should have been free in the first place. It's not going to work, so stop. All the epic games that have a reputation should not be remade into a s****y game. That is all.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Lost my decades old VHS copy in a move, this was the perfect replacement...I had a white 'Cuda in High School...
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Came on time in tact. The movie was astounding and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story line and musicals.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's really good when u need somthin andiksjdhdhdhdd fund.  Subgenre and Dylan and Dylan spouse is not break up the only one who are
0425263916|5.0|I loved continuing the story of Gideon and Eva always wanting to know what was going to happen next.  REFLECTED IN YOU picks up pretty much where BARED TO YOU left off.  I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out. These were great books. Couldn't put them down.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not as good as his earlier works. His writing style is still just a relaxing story-telling syntax so when you need to relax and forget the world, a good place to go but not anything more than a grammar school plot.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|love her music, great messages, fun to dance to and such an awesome show at concerts ! She is REAL folks !
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I felt like an insider reading this book. Maybe I didn't get all the arcane references, but I got a good deal. If you grew up during th 80s this is mandatory reading. The author must have done exhaustive research while writing this book--he must have had a blast!
B007KOYEOC|4.0|A fairly good read, if you believe in fairy tales; I don't think anything like this story would exist outside the writer's romantic imagination
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I must have made a mistake, I started to watch it at 9:30, by 10:30 my eyes needed toothpicks to keep them open.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|And this might be my favorite book I've read in the last year (sorry Beautiful Disaster). This is not a joke - I have a book blog and honestly I go through approximately one book every two days. I rarely give something five stars but this book was simply excellent - even better than the first (I tend to find second novels lacking). I enjoyed the experience cover to cover, I laughed, I cried, and my roommates caught me smiling more than once while reading and couldn't get over it. Honestly the storytelling here is so great; Kiera Cass is incredible. So often with young adult fiction I feel out of the age range or as though the characters are unrelatable but that's so not the case here. Honestly I fell in love with all of them all over again and at pivotal moments in the book I felt myself gripping my iPad so hard my knuckles were turning white.I could talk for forever about this book and will likely go to my blog and do just that but I couldn't do so before first reviewing and crediting the author for this fantastic book.
0735619670|5.0|Although I have not made it through the whole book.  I am enjoying this, how crazy is that!  I am trying to wrap my head around OOP and I have tried to read other books, but just cannot make it through them.  This one keeps my attention.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Highly recommend this movie.  Good action, good SCI FI.  And Jennifer Lawrence was awesome in the movie.  See this movie and you will probably like it ALOT!
B004H1V5RU|3.0|this is my third perplexus (and probably my most anticipated arrival, it just looked that AWESOME). i love them all. the epic i am concerned with because it seems really delicate (it comes with a sticker on it saying: \\"due to epic's sculptural nature please handle with care\\".) that is not the part that really bothers me though, it is this: the ball constantly gets lodged into different places which means you have to dislodge it, meaning you have to shake/bamg it to get it free (which goes against the sticker on it). love the epic but am concerned about it.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|He loves this movie and wanted it on Blu-ray, he now has it and all is great!!!  Thank-you much for it!!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Simply amazing. I read this book in middle schools and decided to pick it up again. Well written and good for all age groups
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app works well for viewing or saving YouTube videos on my Kindle Fire HD.  Without the app, only some youtube videos would play on my Kindle.  With the app nearly all play easily and at decent resolution.  The only one that didn't came up with some sort of restriction saying that it wasn't permitted to play on a mobile device, so I doubt that any app could change that.<br /><br />The app also allows you to save videos to the Kindle, so that you can watch them anytime, even without a wireless signal.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am so happy that I  can now Read my Bible while I am at home or away.  Easy to get too and easy to read.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|it started off very cool, great visuals, very stylized.  had a nice build up and excellent premise but fell apart in the 3rd act trying to tie it all together.  just ok, not horrible but no way great.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another Vince Flynn page turner.  Can't wait until his next book comes out.  I have recommended his work to many friends.
0439813786|5.0|Having read another book by Brian Selznick, I got this one for a niece's son.  He really enjoyed it and it arrived quickly, to his delight.  I think adults would also enjoy this book!
B0091QSNEE|4.0|I ended up buying the full version for my granddaughter, She has had fun, She really likes Dr. Panda hospital also.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|An inciteful aray of well chosen words that entertain and humor the reader in the comfort of their own mind.
B0091QS88K|2.0|I chose this rating cause I ended up having to buy the full version for my granddaughter to have fun. She got tired of the 2 animals and 3 recipes real fast, But she loves the full version and the panda veggie garden,
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So thankful for this awesome opportunity to read to my hearts content!  Look forward to daily published lists of free ebooks from which to choose to read!
B00AMSLRAC|4.0|This has been a fun game for my grandkids especially when they came over and I want a little quite time they get on the kindle and play
0062014102|5.0|The viewpoint in this book is illuminating and very helpful to understanding reality. I read it 6 months ago now so don't remember a lot of detail, but it's a well-written book with a very important viewpoint that I find helpful in understanding our universe.
B00BFV1M1Y|4.0|James Dashner is a talented writer who exceeds in engaging his readers and executing the highs and lows of this book. The only flaws I can think of from merely personal opinion and similar complaints is the fact that Dashner underestimated the expectations of his readers when it came to giving us the answers to the many burning questions as a result of the previous two novels. Overall, death cure was a satisfying read and an excellent ending to the the Maze Runner trilogy.
0694003611|5.0|This is the board book version, which I very much recommend for little hands. I read this to my son uncountable times. When reading a book over and over, it very much helps me if it's a great book. This is a great book. I buy it for anyone I know with a new baby. What a wonderful introduction to reading.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great Read. Dan Brown is a very good writer. Looking forward to the new book. Had the DA Vinci Code in paperback but Kindle and Amazon Cloud is a better way to store my Library.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|When I first saw a trailer for Oblivion, I felt like it was custom made for me. Then, last night, while watching it in IMAX,they started playing a Led Zeppelin song in the movie, I knew it was made for me. Oblivion was a mix of the greatest Sci-Fi already made and yet it was still unique in its own way. Other reviewers have said that the writing is better in the first half and that the movie becomes predictable or not as strong in the second half. I completely disagree. I felt like the script, while borrowing bits from other Sci-Fi, remained engaging and well-done through out the whole movie. If you see this movie in IMAX, in addition to being blown away by the incredible surround sound, you will actually see more of the picture than in a traditional theater. They opened it up for most of the movie. There were a few parts (only one I noticed was around the beginning) where it was the more narrow widescreen picture. For the rest of the time it filled up the huge IMAX screen. The special effects, details, set design, sound design, music, and acting were all top notch in Oblivion (well, Olga was about as good as you can expect from her). The best part about this movie was that my wife liked it. She said it didn't stress her out too much. She also loved the way the music went with the movie. She thought the surround sound and sound effects were some of the best she's heard in a long time. She said she wants to see it again just for the sound. I highly recommend this movie. I liked how by the end, all loose ends are tied up and everything makes sense. This movie does give you the opportunity to think deeper on the meaning, or you can just take what they give you and be totally fine. Go see it in IMAX. I wonder when Tom Cruise will start looking his age...? A note on the CONTENT of the PG-13 rating: Sci-Fi violence on a Star Wars level of graphic-ness. Language that is Low to Middle of the road for PG-13. There is 1 \\"F\\" word, as is normal for PG-13 now-a-days, and a few \\"S\\" words and \\"SOBs.\\" Religious exclamations were very minimal, like two I think. There is a pool scene where you see a dark silhouette of rear female nudity then you can see it through the water for a short time also. In another scene, we see a bare female back from the waist up. Thanks for reading, now go watch this in IMAX. Go in with an open mind and be ready to have fun!<br />BLU-RAY UPDATE: I'll keep this brief. The picture and sound are PERFECT. The only downside is that the blu-ray does NOT include the IMAX aspect ratio change, it stays in 2.39:1 the whole time. The special features are actually really satisfying. And it doesn't take that long to get through them. If you want to see how any aspect of this movie was made, you will see in the making-of portion. If you are like my wife, and feel that the behind the scenes stuff ruins movies, then don't watch this part, because it definitely uncovers the magic behind key scenes. The Audio commentary with the Director and Tom Cruise was extremely interesting and entertaining. The musical score isolated audio track was actually really engaging and showed off the beautiful score. The deleted scenes added a bit of depth. Overall, it is a fantastic blu-ray of an awesome movie. This movie holds up to repeat viewings because you'll notice new stuff each time. Enjoy!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very easy to use.  Love the simplicity of the design.  Just a couple of things I would like to see but are not deal breakers.  The ability to choose either a red or blue display would be nice.  Red sometimes is less intrusive for glare at night for those who are sensitive to light when they sleep.  The dim feature could go a little lower in my opinion.  Lastly, when the alarm goes off the &#34;snooze&#34; and &#34;stop&#34; buttons.  If those could be doubled in size and spread out a little more that would be great.  When your just getting woken up out of a deep sleep the buttons are a tad small to hit in a hurry and you have the possibilily of hitting one option over the other.  Otherwise a very well put together App at a great price.  It will help me out a lot when I travel for work because I hate relying on hotel room alarm clocks.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|John Perry is a good guy, an every man, a born fighter and a natural leader. He makes friends easily, he commands respect wherever he goes, and his tactical nous on the battlefield is very strong. We get to share the surprises and wonders in the story with him, we share in his losses, and we most definitely share in his wins.<br /><br />That said, John seems to be just a little too perfect, just a little too quick with the answer to a deadly problem, and just a little too natural a leader. He always makes the right decisions, he always overcomes improbably odds, and he is always left standing at the end whilst people are dying around him. I liked him, but I just wish he was a little more fallible.<br /><br />The strength of any Scalzi novel, for me, is the dialogue, and Old Man's War is no different. Scalzi puts a lot of time and effort into crafting personalities, and the banter between personalities is quick, witty, and often time profound. Whether its talking about calorie-laden breakfasts or trying to be diplomatic with an aggressive alien species, the dialogue is never in the backseat position and I think that's a good thing. I know I laughed out loud on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Old Man's War is a lot of fun, a science fiction novel that doesn't require you to think too hard about the science. This is probably a weak point for those who prefer their science fiction to be very accurate and specific, but for those looking to get into the genre I think this would be a very good starter book .
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is great when you want to check in on old friends and family members...but hate when you &#34;like&#34; something and you continue to get pages and pages of unwanted article that are feed to your facebook page. If you like one article - they shouldn't continue send more articles.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I've just finished reading this book for the second time, and I don't think I'm even close to unveiling all the mysteries and secrets Sanderson has hidden in there. If you have read the Mistborn series, you will know how things Sanderson briefly mentions in the first chapter of the first book are actually key parts of the mysteries unveiled in the final book. You would also be familiar with Kelsier and his favourite saying - \\"Every secret has a secret.\\"  The Way of Kings is no different, with seemingly random sentences scattered through the book meaning absolutely nothing unless you know the context to which they apply. I am still trying to process the amount of information I learned during my re-read of The Way of Kings. The knowledge you gain during your first read in the latter parts of the book, like knowing how long it takes to summon a shardblade, will actually reveal hidden secrets about different characters during your re-read of the early parts of the book. If you loved this book and you thought you knew exactly what was going on, I implore you to read the book again and see if you change your mind.<br /><br />The thing about this 1000 page door stopper is that its a daunting proposition, and honestly, I would not recommend it if you are new to fantasy or new to Brandon Sanderson. Read one of his shorter works first like The Emperor's Soul. Read the Mistborn trilogy first. Read Warbreaker first (it is available as a free download from Sanderson's website). If you are an epic fantasy enthusiast and you have not read this book, finish whatever book you are currently reading and make this your next book. It is a unique experience that you should not miss out on, but only if you have done some prior preparation.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very good reading, and so easy to understand.<br />I am very glad that I decided to try it.<br />Thank you, Barbara Drastata
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show has a great storyline, but the best part about watching this series on PRIME is HD quality vs. other streaming options.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|had to delete app as it was slowing down my tablet and also gave me problem on cellphone ? maybe just problem with download ?
B009LMTDL0|5.0|My wife owns a restaurant and is just as smart and productive as myself, but I noticed when reading this book, all the small biases I and others have towards her and other women in the workplace, especially when it comes to raising kids (in our case, our son).  It's no longer a matter to agree to simple statements about gender equality in the abstract.  The matter before us is all the residual psychological biases that still ruminate in our minds from when gender really determined much more than it does now. If I'm totally honest with myself, I still have those biases.  They are smaller than my Dad's, but bigger than what I want my son to have. So I'm going to try and lean in to the task Sheryl has sketched out.  I'll start small with more housework,etc., but always with an eye on curbing my lesser tendencies and on giving my wife the confidence and freedom to tackle her own.  Thanks Sheryl.
0385360185|4.0|Sure hope there is another book in the series.<br />Not for the faint of heart, well researched, written and thought out.
0765357151|3.0|This copy had multiple short stories. The \\"I Am Legend\\" tale is original and I appreciate the ending but the remaining tales seem to be filler, as if written just before a doctor's appointment or some other previously scheduled event that the author was already late for.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Just loved this movie.  Has seen the play two times and the movie is so much better with a super cast.  If you like musicals---you'll love this one.
B0095XPZBC|3.0|Love the series but I was disappointed when I found it was presented in the old standard 4:3 aspect ratio. My tv can widen and zoom but then you lose some of the picture which is annoying. This a bluray for HD display it should be in HD aspect Ratio 16x9 or similar
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Exactly as described and arrived in good time.  This is an excellent musical and one of my all time favorties.  The singing is super.
B00BCOQSSQ|2.0|the writing was lackluster, bland and boring. at first its difficult to follow. the characters are unimaginative, would not reccommend or read again.
B006O66EFE|1.0|Terrible show.  What were they thinking?  No wonder this never made it to the theaters.  So shocking that it made it to DVD.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Wasn't expecting this to be as entertaining as it was. Hooked me from start to finish. I recommend to everyone
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Good movie.  I kept wanted to turn the lights on. It was so dark.  The actors did a great job.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Exciting thriller and action movie with great actors and actresses.  I especially like the building scene where Tom Cruize has to jump back into the building and breaks the glass.
B00622D3BS|5.0|this movie is so great.  Love Steve.  Such a cute chick flick that even my man loved and agreed to watch twice.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I love this album, I've spent day listening to it over and over, there is so much more to it then just what the title relays, things like hidden agendas and relationship issues. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to find their dark side. XO
B001HN690O|3.0|This is what they wanted.  I guess it was ok.  The 5 year old was upset by it and cried for 10 minutes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have fallen in love with this series and watch an episode almost every night. We just purchased season 3 and really enjoyed the first episode.
B006BQM762|1.0|Terrible!  Worst movie.  Only finished it because my man wanted to.  Stupid.  Can't believe anyone besides a 14 year old boy would watch.
B005I64U5C|4.0|Came in thinking the worse..but wasn't as bad, the visuals were great casting was good Ryan did an ok job, my only complaint was, why did the animated movie have better script writers then the live action Version?????  baffles the mind!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|one of my favorite series ever- very well done and entertaining, hate to see each episode end and can't wait for the next
B000002NJM|5.0|Tarantino has a knack of finding music that is perfect for the period in his films. The sings in this CD brings back so many memories from the 70's for me.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I played this all the time. So much that I considered buying it.  The graphics are great and the sound effects are awesome. I also like the choice of music too. This game is a definite try out. Once you do you will probably buy it. I did. From Marilyn from Remus, Michigan
B007VPLNGW|5.0|awsome game !!!! i enjoy playing this game just as much as angry birds ! worth downloading!!!! my children love it as well
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Well I had to buy it. I got thru all the levels on the free version. And I had to buy it. I'm glad I did. The deluxe version is even better. Now this one is a toughie. I'm still working at it though. Don't know if there is more to offer after I master these levels of all four dragons. Cause I don't think I'll ever get there to find out. But it is definitely worth the try. I hope this helps in your decision making. Marilyn from Remus, Michigan
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|my 2 year old daughter loves this game !  she plays off and on all day its worth it to pay for this application
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had all the ups and downs I like to see when I watch a movie. It was entertaining and interesting. No movie is ever just like the book so I don't know why we even try to compare. Your imagination is always better than the movie. I will buy this movie because I enjoyed it that much. I do enjoy science fiction and I think this movie will fit right in with my DVD collection.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Great soundtrack, great movie, reminds me of things like Garden State, Pump Up the Volume, and Reality Bites. If you like those movies, you'll probably like this one too
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very addicting and fast paced.  Levels are easy to accomplish and can be done with minimal effort.  I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|As always, very well done. Best viewed on Blu-Ray disc! Sound and picture are awesome. You will enjoy this movie if you enjoyed the rest of the Lord of the Rings series!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|For those of you who are watching the show. You need to read the book, this show is only half the content of this book and boy is this book definitely worthwhile.
B006903GX8|5.0|I absolutely love reading all about the filming, and all about the characters backgrounds...It's a wonderful world to escape to, and be a part of the past....and know that it really exists and you can visit it in England today if you went there..........
0062238868|4.0|My husband purchased this for a trip as reading material on the plane.  He isn't a reader (I don't think I have ever seen him read a book), but he really enjoys this book!  He read it the entire time on the plane.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Ran across this the other day. Trying it out now. Should be all I will ever need. I won't use it very often.
B009AMANH4|3.0|It was a good movie.  I wish it would have delt more with his early life and becoming President and  leading up to the war.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Works well for my note taking and being able to put in seperate notebooks. It makes it easier to retreive them also.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite new movies. Have watched it several times already. Received it within a couple of days of my order.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Its so much better than regular facebook app. Wanted one like on my computer. Closest thing to facebook  that you will ever fine.
B0034G4P94|5.0|We love this movie.  Received it in a very timely manor also.  We would recommend it not just to wrestling fan but for anyone.  It is just a great movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Was looking for just a plan calculator and this was what I was looking for. Works well for me. Awesome.
0802473164|4.0|I got this book for myself first (the general version), and then bought this version for my husband. I thought the concepts in the book were interesting, and would be willing to give them a try. Don't know if my husband finished reading the book.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I'll admit I approached this book with some caution. I have cracked open books like this before, they have an interesting story, nice characters, but then they get muddled up in plot inconsistencies, poor writing, or just over the top wacky development. This book was unlike all of the others. It actually had thoughtful sentence structure and literary devices. I got a 5 on the AP literature test, look up score percentages to see what that tells you, and trust me when I say that I know the nuances behind words and imagery and that I can decode books like you've never imagined. This book left me with goose-bumbs when I finished. Actual, hair standing on end, goose-bumps. So before dismissing this book as another run-of-the-mill YA dystopian novel, pick it up, you might just find a gem.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Great 3D film and overall movie. The 3D effects are very crisp and clear with several \\"popout\\" scenes. The 3D depth is also very nice and crisp too.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I read all of Tom Clancy's books, on my kindle. Enjoy all this one I loved.<br />He is still one of the best.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|3D quality was good. There aren't very many \\"popout\\" scenes, but the depth is good. The story is interesting also.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is an awesome game. Time just goes by when I am trying to beat the levels cause they get harder and harder
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I gave it three stars cause I thought it was a good movie, but not a great movie.<br />The graphics a very nice and interesting to watch.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Pretty good after you get past all he dead baby stuff.  Good info on the Canadian diamond industry.  Lots of dead people!
B001XCWPAM|5.0|good action films.....somewhat realistic.....locations make the movies....good acting by Damon......who would ever think any government would have such a cruel plot to kill ones own agent?.......USA FOOL.....
B007W4OZ76|1.0|In today's world if an app doesn't work with a couple of obvious clicks then it is not worth the download.  I have all kinds of apps and am well beyond &#34;computer savvy&#34; but this app simply will not work for me.  I downloaded as a precursor to installing an app to operate Dropbox on my Kindle.  I have since deleted both apps.  Don't waste your time on this one.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|good picture show.....lots of action.....quite unrealistic but who cares.....will recommend this to others who love action as an everyday diversion

B00BIVN82M|3.0|I became a Michael Buble fan rather late, just a year or so ago.  But I quickly bought most of his LPs and have enjoyed all of them.  Sometimes, I love the way he deconstructs a song, casting aside the usual arrangement and reinventing it as a different song.  To me the prime example of this is his version of the old standard \\"Cry Me a River\\" which becomes a staggering, defiant song of angst rather than the usual sappy weeper it usually seems to be.  But no great examples of Buble's style, such as \\"River\\", are found on this current LP.<br /><br />I tend to agree with the other reviewers on here who say that this LP seems to force Michael Buble out of his comfort zone.  Not a bad thing to try, certainly, and I can't say there are any really bad songs on this album.  However, Buble seems to be trying to sing more in an Uptown R&B mode rather than the saloon singer/crooner with an edge where he seems most natural.  I find some of the arrangements too \\"bright,\\" I would say, not a good background to his supple, slightly gritty baritone.<br /><br />Definitely, Buble is not an R&B singer.  I was looking forward to his rendering of two songs with Motown lineages, \\"Who's Loving You\\" and \\"To Be Loved,\\" the former originally performed by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles and the latter by Jackie Wilson.  But \\"Loving You\\" is too jazzy, not plaintive enough.  Michael Jackson on the very first Jackson 5 LP way back in '69 or '70 performed it much better.  \\"To Be Loved\\" as well just comes across as forced sounding and almost a pose, something I find in many of Harry Connick's recordings, and with a dull MOR background.  I found the arrangement of \\"Something Stupid\\" charming but the vocals a little too reminiscent of Frank and Nancy Sinatra (Nancy, like the non-singer on this recording, certainly didn't have her father's pipes) to offer anything new.  Even the Bee Gees' classic \\"To Love Sombeody\\" which actually has been recorded by many R&B and even jazz singers including the SweetInspirations and Nina Simone with great success seems oddly ill suited in a too upbeat arrangement with Buble almost shouting the lyrics on what should be a song which emphasizes regret and longing in an understated way.<br /><br />Overall, I think the choice of material was intriguing but the arrangements too \\"aggressive\\" and bright, and Buble's vocals too far out of sync with the endearing and yearning qualities which have really earned him his stripes over the years.<br /><br />Hopefully, the album will grow on me.  As I said, there's not really a bad song on it.  But overall, Buble sounds like he was forced into a vocal arena where he really doesn't belong, trying to compete with noisy and unmusical arrangements and therefore having to sing more like an R&B shouter than the song stylist he really is.

B005V20JKI|2.0|Uninstalling..<br /><br />Had this game on my phone for a long time..then it updated and I was excited thinking new levels and characters!  But no....the only thing the update did was lock characters and levels that I already had unlocked and requires me to pay to get them back..<br /><br />Game was great fun...but now its a joke.<br /><br />Don't pay for or install this game. Its a ripoff and the developers should be ashamed of themselves....I would have paid for new levels....but charging JUST to get what I already had is a joke.<br /><br />SHAME

B000FCKGPC|2.0|I was captivated by the first 3 books...and disappointed in this one. I kept waiting and waiting to be spellbound...it never happened. Too much time was spent retelling and setting up book 5. It felt as though GRRM fell in love with the sound of his voice and forgot to speak for his characters. We've come to love and loathe them...but were woefully shortchanged this time around.
B003O86FMW|5.0|it was a fast moving book  recommended to me by my grandchildren.<br />the author was able to keep my attention thru the whole book
B006PZBR8S|5.0|When I first saw previews for this movie, my first thought was \\"Hey, they finally made a movie out of the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots game.\\"  Silly, I know, but in this day and age where they can make a successful film franchise out of a toy line (the \\"Transformers\\" films) and a Disneyland ride (the \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" films), then why not a game?  It could work if they have the right people behind it, right?  (This was before the bomb that was \\"Battleship\\" came out, mind you...)<br /><br />Unlike the aforementioned \\"Battleship\\" movie, however, \\"Real Steel\\" is a wonderful movie.  It's not a heavy science-fiction film, or really even an action film despite featuring fighting robots.  It's a film with heart behind its metallic brawn, and even though the robots get plenty of screen time it's the human element that makes this film shine.<br /><br />Based loosely on a Richard Matheson short story, \\"Real Steel\\" follows Charlie, a washed-up former boxing champ turned fighting-robot manager who's deeply in debt and has just lost his last fighting robot in a particularly brutal match.  He finds himself a reluctant caretaker to his estranged son, Max, and ends up taking the boy with him as he travels the country, trying to scrape together funds to buy or build a new robot and pay his debts.  When Max comes across an outdated sparring bot abandoned in a junkyard and decides to restore it and fight it, Charlie is skeptical... but Atom, Max's bot, turns out to be far tougher than anyone realizes, and soon Atom becomes a sensation in the underground fighting league.  And it may be Atom that ends up drawing father and son together.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is fairly predictable -- you've probably seen it in a hundred sports movies before and are likely to see it again.  But that doesn't mean the plot doesn't work here.  The premise of a near-future where robots do the fighting in the boxing ring adds a fresh twist to the plot, and the characters bring a lot of heart to their roles.  Hugh Jackman proves to be a versatile, phenomenal actor, and brings a gruff pathos to his role as Charlie.  Max starts off as the typical whiny child, but develops into a likable and spunky kid as the movie progresses.  The \\"villains\\" of this film (the creator and manager of the champion fighting bot Zeus, and a borderline-sadistic promoter to whom Charlie owes money) are fairly one-note and flat, but that just makes it all the more satisfying when they get their just dues.  And Atom, despite being mute and personality-less throughout the film, somehow manages to win the viewers heart as well -- who doesn't like an underdog story, and want to see the little guy win?<br /><br />The visual effects in this film are phenomenal as well.  The film is portrayed as a \\"near-future\\" where many elements are similar, but the robots don't come across as a jarring addition.  At times it's easy to forget one is watching CGI effects and not actual machinery, and each of the fighting bots has its own unique look.  It makes me wish this movie had come with a decent toy line, because I know I would buy myself a miniature version of Atom or Noisy Boy if I could.  Oddly enough, the most jarring \\"special effects failure\\" in the film comes from the fight in the opening scene, where a fighting robot takes on a bull -- it's quite easy to tell when they stop using an actual animal and start using a CGI dummy.  But then, visual effects haven't come far enough to produce animals that don't look fake, I suppose...<br /><br />This film has been described as \\"Rocky with robots,\\" and I have to say it's an accurate description.  It has a LOT of heart, great acting, and a story that has been told many times but manages to not be stale or cheesy here.  Even if you're not a sci-fi fan, I'd give this movie a look -- it's a good heartwarming film, and the robots are just the cherry on top for me.<br /><br />Recommended for ages 10 and up, due to language and violence.o their roles.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After viewing the earlier episodes, it was nice to see the two characters get married.  It is interesting how one can become attached to the characters and want their lives to turn out okay.  Of course, it is easy to see that there will most likely be turmoil in upcoming episodes that will affect them and their relationship.

1400069742|5.0|Excellent insight provided on the bits and pieces from the history taught in school.  It shows how arrogant some 'heros' can be and the terrible problems they create because the media pumps them up.  It also shows the major flaws in Roosevelt that are not addressed in school.  It is taught he was a leader, only because the media so said so.  He followed the polls much like the current occupier of the White House.  In Roosevelt's case, he was much better prepared so he was more at fault for not doing his job.

And we can try to feel okay about them.&#34;<br />- Charlie (Perks of being a Wallflower)

0345803485|1.0|I heard that this book series has sold 35 million copies. I find it hard to believe<br />that there are than many people stupid enough, curious enough, or sex starved enough to buy this childish smutt. No wonder women get a bad rap for how they think and act as to romance and sexual fantacy. Other than some teenage girls, I have no idea who this book would appeal to...a sad commentary, but true.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Nicely done, gripping, Affleck's acting is good, but the hostage characters are all-too 70's and appear laughable with their hair and manner of dress.  The only thing missing was bell-bottom pants.  I recommend the story, however.
B002SRQ214|5.0|It works very well<br />Maybe the best deal for a AM3 socket for it price.<br />It comes with a good quality cooler
B005LAIIJY|5.0|While a serious subject, it is treated with both violence and humore.  It is always good to see Samuel Jackson in a Quentin movie, and once again his hair is worthy of the character he plays.<br /><br />DeCaprio is OK, but Smith is stylish and distinctive.  Look for unexpected faces in the characters portrayed....lots of surprises
B008OP32M6|5.0|This is the most expensive lego set I've ever purchased, but it was worth it!  Super solid body with no worries of little pieces falling off should the truck roll over or topple.  Suspension and clearance allows for driving over anything in reason, and the durable cog pieces (unlike some earlier technic models) prevent gear strippage.  It doesn't move very fast, and it's a bit top heavy with the battery box and body, but still a blast to drive around the yard or house.  Alternate model instructions available for download at lego.com, but I wouldn't bother- it's quite ugly, throws the weight balance off, and requires no sticker placement, so, if they're already applied, it's just going to look odd.  It took me 2 solid days of building to complete, so coming off surgery with time to kill, this was an ideal boredom stopper.  Alternate model build took a day with the disassembly of the primary, building secondary, testing the secondary, stripping the secondary and going back to the primary (alternate build requires only stripping down to the chassis).  All in all, very impressed with this latest entry into the technic line-up,  as it has come a long way in the last 15 years!  Highly recommend it, but order directly from lego.com, free shipping and you can rack up $10 in free discounts for future purchases if you sign up for an account.

B005HJWWW8|2.0|I've got some nice headphones, and was looking for a cheap portable improvement to the audio-out on my iPod. This isn't it. As far as I can tell, this gives worse audio than the normal headphone jack.<br /><br />It does work, though, and has some bass-boost and other modes that may be useful for some headphones. Not for me though.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This story was edited very badly. I liked the plot, but there were so many grammatical and spelling errors that it was distracting. Also, someone should check the timeline of the plot; it makes little sense. Finally,t  there are many places where that things that are said conflict directly with a point earlier in the novel, IE Thor drinks ale at a feast, then later he has his first cask of ale at an ale house (he drank two at the feast previously), or how Gwen (spelled at times Gwyn, or Gwynn, or Gwenn, varying multiple times on a single page) has a smile which drops for the first time twice in the span of a single page. Overall, someone just needs to take a critical loo  at this and remove the errors.

B00B6QXN56|5.0|One of his best projects yet, his guitar work is as good as always. The other musicians just made it that much better
B0008ENHUI|4.0|Papillon is a great film. It's a brilliant, action packed, and memorable story of one man's indomitable will, survival, strength, determination, and unquenchable courage.<br /><br />The cast is excellent - with Steve McQueen stealing the scenes and carrying the entire film on his back with his electrifying performance as prisoner Henri Charriere, or Papillon - the butterfly. I do not believe the movie would be the same without the King of Cool. He turns in a performance of surprising depth, weight, nuance, and incredible acting. Dustin Hoffman is good too as Papillon's companion Dega, but there is nothing showy in his performance, just solid, excellent acting.<br /><br />The story could use a bit of work. It is based on Charriere's memoir of the same name, which, according to researchers, is about 50% fiction. The movie itself veers from the book, expanding a questionable side turn with an Indian tribe, and a lengthily tattoo sequence that adds nothing to the plot. I felt the story petered out towards the last half of the film. Interesting fact, the real Charriere was in his early 40's when he escaped Devil's Island, not old and white-haired and feeble like the movie implies.<br /><br />But I have no problems with the incredible sets - filmed on location in Puerto Rico and French Guyana, the incredible prison scenes that accurately display life in a 1940's work camp. The rainforests, the beaches, the sunny locales, the mangroves, the deserts...all are displayed excellently onscreen on Papillon. The tone of the film is good too, with thrills, emotion, double crosses, suspense, horror, romance, and even some humour thrown into the mix.<br /><br />I believe the best part of the film takes place when Charriere is in solitary confinement after a failed escape attempt. The entire 30 minute scene takes place inside his solitary cell. There are no frills, just 3 actors, one set, one scene, and incredible acting from Steve McQueen. And even more incredible, most of the scenes are silent, without dialogue. The scene shows his indomitable will, his determination, his humanity, and most of all, a brilliant portrayal of hope.<br /><br />There is an incredible scene in the solitary confinement episode - a mad scene by Papillon - that is such an stunning display of acting that I found myself lost in the character's plight, awed by McQueen's skills. The King of Cool proved he was not only slick and cool as hell, but also an incredible actor. Another brilliant scene is where the sadistic guards curtain Papillon's cell in complete darkness, but to Papillon's delight, there is a chink in the curtain, allowing a sliver of light to come through. It's a brilliant display of hope in time of need. In one scene, McQueen leaps onto the prison bars and whispers, \\"I'm still here, you bastards!\\" Brilliant. Positively thrilling.<br /><br />In many ways, Papillon is a lot like Shawshank Redemption - it's a story of a man who never stopped trying to escape from prison, a man who had indomitable will, great personal strength, and great patience. It's a memorable classic with great actors and acting, sets, characters, and memorable scenes.<br /><br />Strong Recommendation!s are silent, without dialogue.

B00ARA4SLU|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock.  I think most people are, or even if they aren't they can certainly appreciate the impact he's had on film in general.  Fewer names are as known as Hitchcock's, and fewer films are as associated with that name as `Psycho'.  So, when you have a film devoted to exposing what went on behind the scenes of the filming of that monumental film, you have my attention.<br /><br />Sadly, this doesn't all work out like I had expected.<br /><br />The film shuffles a few angles to try and compose a well-rounded look at Hitch and his process, but it doesn't all come together like it thinks it does.  Opening with a shot of Ed Gein killing his brother and then having Hitchcock infamously narrate the proceedings, `Hitchcock' opens with promise.  Moving from there to the aftermath of success from Hitchcock's `North by Northwest' and the struggle to find something new and exciting, we see him set his sights on `Psycho', a novel inspired by Gein's killings and something far too violent and grisly for Paramount to accept.  So, Hitchcock decides to fund it himself, and he goes to work.  We see his relationship with his wife, Alma, and her need to more recognition and purpose and the fact that her friend Whitfield Cook continually tries to woo her.  We see his onset antics, his paternal relationship with Leigh and his vile contempt for Vera Miles.  We see him fight with his inner demons as well as the studio, and yet it all feels so thankless.<br /><br />That is really the only word that comes to mind when I think of this film.  It's thankless.  Nothing really stands out as noteworthy, other than those sets and costumes.  The performances are uniformly decent, but no one really stands out other than maybe Mirren, who shades Alma in a way that feels lived in.  Johansson, Biel, Collette and D'Arcy are barely there at all, Huston is certainly a stereotype with little meat to hold him together and Hopkins looks too much like DeVito's Penguin to make much of a real impact.  The interwoven storylines, particularly those involving Gein, serve as an interesting concept and yet don't really add much to the overall film itself.  I felt like Hitch was never really explored.  All of the horror stories revolving around his domineering, egotistical and sexist ways was never presented as anything more than a fleeting possibility.  It is far too sentimental a film to have much bite.<br /><br />I loved the idea of it being a comedic take on the man, full of cheeky fun and insight and yet it just felt bland and uninteresting.a real impact.

0425252868|5.0|I introduced this book to my book group which concentrates on history. Everyone has enjoyed it because it describes real people and how their humanity is not lost even in the trials of war.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I love this movie. The story is great but the visuals alone make this well worth it. If you can watch it in HD please do. It's really amazing.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is a great movie for children and families. It's funny although my child did pick up the word hobo and now ask everyone. Are you a hobo??? Great movie though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is good cause it's 7 dollars and gets new updates that are great so get this game do it
B00AZRBLHO|1.0|Work related fantasies of underpaid&overworked IT guy.<br />Boring, predictable and total waste of time.<br />(Unless you work in IT, in that case it's probably worth reading)
B00A8LYYI0|3.0|Movie to my was ok, wasn't bad but ok am still looking for that one movie that give me amazing pop out effects with a good story line. any suggestion?
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|It is truly a talented author who can ask and answer the question, &#34;What must it have been like for them?&#34; Set in awful and true to life circumstances, these beautifully developed characters take you through the range of emotions while telling a story of survival. I'm looking forward to what McKenna does next.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  I had no knowledge of the history of the orphan trains and I found it to be very informative and quite disturbing.  On a whole I felt that the characters were very well developed and that their individual histories were woven together quite beautifully.  My book group read this book and we found much to discuss.
1574214276|4.0|This is a nice book for beginners in Zentangling.  Practicing these designs will teach you what you can and can not do, how your hand will and wont move, etc.<br /><br />Once you realize what you can do, I encourage you to just draw and find your own style that you can call your own.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This CD makes me SO happy!<br /><br />Hands down, I feel this is true brilliance, in every sense of the word, on every track.<br /><br />The hip-hop and heavy metal and legend collaborations are just a bonus.<br /><br />This CD has made me feel so much passion and reverence and the songs are sing-a-long as well.<br /><br />To me,every song could be a hit and I think this should be the album on the year, 2013!<br /><br />I applaud you, Fall Out Boy, for being so courageous to be reverent and catchy at the same time and incorporating different styles, not on purpose, but because you were influenced by many styles of music - I am a huge fan!!
0385349947|5.0|From Caution Curves Ahead<br /><br />Last weekend, I inherited a grown up car.<br /><br />I've owned two cars. The first, a 1988 325I Silver Blue BMW convertible we called Baby Blue and I drove her from the age of 16 to 27. We drove up and down the Cali coast to and from Berkeley and then to and from anywhere I could go - singing Life is a Highway for my most formative years, and I learned early -<br /><br />I wanna drive it. All night long!!!<br /><br />The second, a 2005 AWD black 92x Saab, was called the Black Booty because her trunk was almost always packed with adventurey stuff. \\"Summers, do you live in your car?\\"<br /><br />The answer, \\"no.\\" but there is no doubt at any given moment I might need spin shoes, bungee cords, a tent, a LOT of beach blankets, roller blades, fins, a change of clothes, extra running shoes, a bikini and raisins.<br /><br />Not apocalypse readying ... impromptu adventure readying.<br /><br />Last weekend, I landed in a Prius. An insanely generous gift from my dad who was ready for a new car and sold Black Booty and moved my \\"I Feed the Bears\\" decal from the front window to my new front window, and sat in the Prius.<br /><br />She doesn't have a moon roof. She's silver. She's very grown up.<br /><br />At the same time I landed in my new grown up car, I finally had time to listen to Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In. It seemed like a good way to bond. I download and listen to audio books on 3x Narrator Speed. It makes things more efficient and I think there's a chance it's making me smarter to listen really fast.***<br />(*** totally unproven theory)<br /><br />Here's what I learned in my new grown up car with the uber fast VO of Lean In:<br /><br />1) Now more than ever it's time to put the pedal to the floor<br />and drive this highway of life.<br /><br />2) Especially because I'm a girl, it's time to lean into each bend in the road.<br /><br />3) Now more than ever, it's the time to encourage those around us<br />to find their lead foot.<br /><br />Ladies, let's drive!<br /><br />Hearing the experiences of Sheryl while she drove head first into her career and motherhood reminded me of so much that I've grappled with when looking at the rear view of my own curvy road.<br /><br />Did anybody else know Sheryl married way too early and it didn't work out and then she got married again and seems to be doing just fine!?!?!<br /><br />Does anybody else know that there was a moment when she realized painfully that being smart made her less likeable and that she dumbed herself down for the sake of a boy and...... (hush) for the sake of some girls?!?!?!?!!<br /><br />Or that we are all more likely to hold off on raising our hand and instead be demure, because modesty is a quality lauded in girls and aggressive is bad.... but not so much in boys?!?!?!?<br /><br />Does anybody else remember the day someone told her not to brag or to be bossy and it made her afraid to take charge and lead and be acknowledged for her accomplishments?!?!?!?!<br /><br />Because OMG I do!!<br /><br />Succeeding in whatever endeavor you are faced with isn't easy. We must take our natural given talents and excel accordingly. This is where Tinkerbell comes in.<br /><br />A friend of mine (ok ok ok ok, yes I'll admit it's #34) worked on Tinkerbell and I'd never actually seen it, until this afternoon. After getting all fired up driving up and down PCH to meetings listening to Sheryl, I needed a day at home doing bills. Guess what was there on Netflix?<br /><br />Why yes, it's a fairytale about a fairy who wants to be extraordinary.<br /><br />There's this fairy, her name is Tink, and she's really good at certain things, but wishes she was something different. She wishes she could do all sorts of other things, instead of excel at the things she's got God given talent to do. So she tries, she screws up, then she revisits her skills, learns new ways to use them, and figures out how to kick tail with what she's got.<br /><br />And darlings, that's precisely the point of Lean In.<br />You are who you are.<br />You have what you need to excel.<br />You don't need to sit on your wings and be afraid to fly.<br /><br />I'd like to think of myself as Sheryl in that first year in Silicon Valley or Tink when she is trying to suss out what to do with a bolt. I've got this.<br /><br />If you ARE or KNOW a woman, if you have or are a daughter, if you interact with chicks at any point and are the least bit educated......<br /><br />YOU MUST read/ listen to Lean In.<br />It is simply mandatory.<br />You need this frame of reference.<br /><br />(and if you have an extra 90 minutes some Sunday afternoon, you should probably watch Tinkerbell)<br /><br />I'll see y'all on the drive..... in my sorta grown up car.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Works perfectly very addictive and is easy to learn. Almost as fun as hero's a must have for all strategic game lovers.
B00542USJW|5.0|Being a Michael Jordan fan, I may be bias on this but also being a Looney Tunes fan, I can really be honest too.  This is a fun movie.  Old school fans of Looney Tunes may say nay to this movie because it may not hit to them the way the old cartoons do but for kids or parents who watch movies with their kids, this is a good mixture.  Bill Murray is in this also to add a little comedy to it, being a long time Bulls fan and friend to Michael Jordan, I figured he'd be in it anyway.  No, Michael Jordan won't win any Academy Awards for his performance but he was a lot better than you'd expect in this.  There is typical Looney Tunes action and gags that are cute and funny for everyone and sports stuff for the sports fans.  The &#34;Monstars&#34; that are there to take play the bad guys are big ugly looking monsters, I do not think they are anything scary for kids, they act goofy and tough at the same time but I think kids 5 and up would be fine with seeing them without being scared. I enjoy this movie, my daughter isn't a fan of Looney Tunes but my wife and I are, and my wife does want to watch this so hopefully we can talk my daughter into it as well.  Good family movie for a movie night in my opinion.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Lots of twists and unexpected turns to keep the reader interested to know what was going to happen next.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|I like most Paul Newman movies, who doesn't really....good looking, tough guy who doesn't mind joking or getting down and dirty to defend himself, a man's man who is also very down to earth and acts like one of the crowd.  This movie of course has one of the all time great quotes to it, if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about.  Paul Newman plays a convict who is sent to prison to work on a chain gang and he doesn't make too many friends at first but earns respect soon.<br />Really good story to it, some funny parts, good action, some drama, just really an overall enjoyable movie to watch.  I watch it anytime I see it on one of the older movie channel's like Turner Classic or AMC.  After watching it, you kind of want to strut around like Cool Hand Luke and be joe cool like him.....but we all know, there is only one Paul Newman who can pull that off.  Not any foul language in it, some fighting in it, teenagers would be able to watch this movie and they'd be ok with the content in it. And for any adults who haven't seen it....What are you waiting for???
B008BM9L72|3.0|This seemed to end up in mid-air. Did not know which book I was in and it finished up without an ending. Very disappointed!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Steve Carell is hilarious as the voice of Gru.  I will definitely be buying this movie and anxiously waiting for #2 :)
B000SEGMAU|4.0|Tuesdays with morrie helped me to learn all my aunt experience. I lost my favorite aunt to ALS 6weeks after losing my mother to MS..a disease similar to ALS. I read this book 2weeks later and it helped me to begin to heal.

B0010SB6OK|4.0|With this book, I discovered another interesting British science fiction author, Alastair Reynolds. And what a find! He, like Hamilton, embodies my perfect author of such books as his novels fall under the space opera but rich of almost plausible technology, talk about the future of humanity, are pretty long and complex, but also really imaginative. Oh yes, because Reynolds has really a fantasy out of the ordinary. Not everyone can conceive of a story like that of \\"Century Rain\\".<br />I'll try to define the main points of the plot without spoiling it.<br />\\"Century Rain\\" is set in a future where Earth has been destroyed by nanotechnology. On scary nanotechnology I had recently read \\"Prey\\" by Crichton, however, the main theme here is something else. I do not like at all post-apocalyptic stories, but the so-called nanocaust spoken of in this book is just a detail of the plot and defines the environment in which the story moves.<br />Human survivors live in space stations orbiting the planet. Among them is the main female character, Verity Auger, an archaeologist expert in Paris, which is now just a ghost town. Auger is involved in a very special mission. On Phobos (one of the satellites of Mars) a wormhole was discovered that connects two distant parts of the galaxy. At the other end they found a huge sphere, inside which is a \\"functioning\\" replica of Earth, as it was in 1959. An alien species (undefined) has created many replicas of our planet, including this one that you can access. But the timeline in which these humans live in ignorance is a bit different from that of the true twentieth century.<br />These are the premises. The story is located somewhere between space opera, hard sci-fi, thriller, espionage and time travel, although you do not really travel in time. The way in which it is built is really intriguing, with well-defined characters. The book is very long, because so many things happen, which are difficult to predict, and this makes it very entertaining.<br />Yet even in this case, I stopped at four stars. The reason is simple: in the end the author, in my opinion, did not play his cards right. Being British, I would have expected something outside the box and instead Reynolds seems to have lost himself in the thick of it. Apart from the fact that the love story between the protagonists develops too abruptly and is not at all credible, perhaps because of that a bit too cold, but above all unnatural, look given to the female protagonist by the author (as it often happens when a male author moves a female protagonist), and then that story ends just as suddenly. Even if its end could be explained by a too fast start, two inconsistencies put together, however, do not generate a realistic event, but instead make things worse. For if you forgive the first one, you cannot do the same for the second one.<br />But the worst is right at the end. In this regard, suffice it to say that the characters, after all they've been through, find themselves exactly to the starting point. She seems to have learned nothing. He grew up, instead, but in fact he finds himself again in the condition in which he \\"lived\\" at the beginning of the story. Despite the beautiful prose and the poetic image of the last scene, I was disappointed. An author of this kind, capable of conceiving a story like that, should be more daring.<br />As a justification for the author I must, however, say that the ending is left quite open, allowing readers to imagine how it could continue, perhaps with a better ending.<br />Despite all this, then, I highly recommend reading this book to science fiction lovers who at the same time do not disdain some vintage vibe.<br /><br />Rita Carla Francesca Monticelli, author of [[ASIN:B00L979374 Red Desert - Point of No Return]]g.<br />Yet even in this case, I stopped at four stars.

0823003590|4.0|A good guide for me during my portrait class. The media described in the book is a little specialized but the descriptions and examples apply to all portraiture.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Steve Martin's rendition of &#34;I am a dentist&#34; is one of many memorable moments!  Not to be missed!  Also should be required viewing for all horticulturists!
B00C27LB20|4.0|I heard Jake on the Tonight Show and I liked his folky style. I'm ancient and I was a folk fan back in the 60's and 70's.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|This amp sounded like a good idea but did nothing to increase the volume level. It did not work as expected
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very well done,great puzzles,graphics/detail, I really enjoyed this puzzler, well worth the price, if you like puzzle games I'd recommend checking this out
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This very good game. Very long. Thank you. Too many pay items needed. Kids cannot get where they need to go. Too harsh.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Excellent acting, The storyline turns so differently and I was surprised with the ending as well but I liked it! I highly recommend this one!
B00338QENI|4.0|this was my local book club selection.  The story is riveting and well written.  Thanks to these scientists I am alive today.  The author managed to make the science information very easy to understand  for anyone who lacks a science background or is left behind in the progress of bio medical trends.  She avoided bigotry and ramming her opinion down your throat.  You were left with a unique view of all sides and, in my case deep gratitude.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Very thought provoking. The movie gives you some insights into the dilemnas that leaders have to face. Lincoln knew what it would take to win and also knew the value of compromise. I highly recommend this one!
B00371V6SE|4.0|It probably won't rock your world but this is a nice easy book to read and a sweet rambling story.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What a great and unexpected journey, like life itself! I've watched this movie more than any others I own. I love the mixture of humor, the seriousness of their mission, and the challenges they overcome. It is brilliantly played!
B0062OCNAI|5.0|We read this book for our book club.  It really made me think about what goes on while a person is in a coma or seriously injured.  Also, I realized that what we see in a person may not be who they really are.  Well written, good character development and an intriguing story,
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Reacher never let's me down...he still presses his clothes between the mattress and the box frame.  I rest my case.  He's the best!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Good book it is amazing. I liked it. Best book ever. Could not have been Better. I am going to read the next book.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Funny, entertaining and interesting all wrapped up into one movie. Loved the depth of characters and the intertwined lives. Overall, great!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|A very interesting story about the possibility of life in other worlds.<br />I believe her, will you?<br />Watch and find out for yourself.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Based on a true story, this story mixed realism, documentary style, and narrative portrayal of the rescue of the hostages in Iran. The balance was solid throughout the movie, whereas other movies would stray from this. The acting was also solid from all the actors. They really went out of their way hiring actors who look the original people they portrayed at an important part of history. This movie was just solid all around.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I got this 99&cent; game for free. and I would soooooooooooooo pay the 99&cent;. get this app it is awesome.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I watched this movie in the theater and was absolutely drawn in to the story of this movie. Based on a true story, this movie told the story of these brothers with no regret of not hiding the visual and verbal details of what these brothers went through in an important period of their lives. Guy Pierce played his role really well embodying the bad guy you want to pull out of the screen and beat the snot out of. Shia LaBeouf's performance was almost enchanting being the weak brother who transformed to a respected man of the town like the rest of his brothers. Tom Hardy is just a solid sensational actor playing the tough and respected brother the town fears and highly respect. This is just a great freakin' movie!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Watching on Amazon Prime was great HD Easy to watch on Amazon Prime and even with a Linksys WIFI worked great
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Just a lot of fun!  A great extended version from start to finish. If you like bands and their music from the 60's this is great!!
B0074MZSWW|3.0|ok but didnt knock me off my feet for the entire album.  Its already back on the shelf. oh well
B00498VS9G|5.0|Good plot, Fast paced, and very good for a British TV show. If you like zombies movies, You can't go wrong with this one.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This was a lovely story full of loss and love and humor and sadness. It made me laugh and cry
B00AOOIIVA|5.0|Even though the subject matter was a little weird, it was a movie about the love between a boy and his dog.  I loved it!  Yes, I would recommend this movie.
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|Really really enjoyed the character development in this book. The characters are rich and authentic . Corrigan is my favorite . I  like the way he<br />  jumps back and forth in time to bring you up-to-date in the lives of his characters.
B000FC13MM|5.0|Powerful story, touching father-daughter moments, really interesting world, and a likable, strong, evolving heroine. Kudos for no rape scene, as that seems to be standard entertainment in sci fi these days (which I hate);  female characters can have a non-revenge motive to accomplish something.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading more.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It was so confusing, in a good way, how you don't really know if WICKED is good or not. Personally I think they are not worth trusting. I can't believe what Teresa did to Thomas, I would be totally fine with him not forgiving her, he should be with Brenda.<br />  IT WAS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004GYY714|4.0|A friend told me about this. It was simple to get, simple to use, and I would recommend anyone to get it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than the movie. I hope the next movie will be truer to the book. The author did a great job.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I give it five stars because it's a very good book. It includes love and strong description of every detail.
B00BJS7104|5.0|I was very skeptical about watching this sort of content in a movie! But I 'm was very elated to see a movie so well directed that I was held in suspense the entire length of the movie! The acting was outstanding! Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington energy was spell bounding! To say the least I was not disappointed! Since I have purchased this video , I have watched it maybe six times! This will be a video that I could watch over and over! Your money will be well spent, if you decide to purchase it!

B00005K9LM|3.0|After 30 years as a metal fan, I finally broke down and purchased this album.  I have most of the rest of Priest's catalog, but this title has just been out of my consciousness.  Granted I know 90% of the songs already from other releases, though I was really glad to hear \\"Jawbreaker\\" for the first time.<br /><br />As others have said, the regular album tracks are simply classic Priest, and are well worth your time and money.  Not having owned the original recording, I can't really comment on the remaster, but it generally sounds fine to my ears.<br /><br />\\"Bonus tracks\\" on any release are a hit-and-miss affair, and this release lives up that rule by totally missing.  Whiff.  The acoustic ballad \\"Turn on Your Light\\" is just terrible.  Awful and simplistic \\"love\\" lyrics over a simple acoustic picking chord progression.  The recording somehow emphasized the sound of Tipton's guitar pick hitting the strings to the degree that it covers up the sound of the actual pitches at times.  The included liner notes claim the song's lack of prior release to be \\"a mystery\\", but there's no mystery: someone smart at Priest's label said \\"no, that song is terrible, no way you're releasing it.\\"  Other reviewers here have reportedly enjoyed the song.  Not me.<br /><br />The other bonus track is an embarrassingly docile live version of \\"Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith\\".  While the band's musical performance is fine, the audience participation portion, where the crowd is supposed to answer Halford's \\"We are...\\" with a vigorous \\"defenders of the faith\\", is just sad.  The crowd is clearly unprepared to sing the lyric and largely uninterested in doing so, with the result that they barely sing and therefore are barely audible.  On stage, Halford has to pretend he's impressed and pretend the interaction is going well, but his whoops and exhortations sound forced and superficial.  I find it interesting that the band didn't resort to studio trickery and boost the audience's level on this recording in order to create more of a traditionally exciting participation section.<br /><br />To conclude, if you're one of the last hold outs who's still not purchased this album, I'd say you should do it.  While you'll have to hold your nose when the bonus tracks come on, the regular album tracks more than make up for them.rding in order to create more of a traditionally exciting participation section.<br /><br />To conclude, if you're one of the last hold outs who's still not purchased this album, I'd say you should do it.

1589949811|5.0|This is a very fun, very involved 1-2 person game right out of the box.  The art on the cards is beautiful, and the different tokens and threat counter are well made, like most FFG materials.  There are 3 scenarios that come with the core, from beginner to hard.  I bought this to mainly play solo, and after about 15 plays I can consistently beat the easiest scenario, but have only beat the medium scenario once.  I havent even tried the hardest scenario yet, and probably wont until I can add some adventure packs to my deck.  The deck-building is challenging and fun and will keep you busy for a while.  I definitely recommend.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The movie was a bit long, but I enjoyed it. DDL was extraordinary as Lincoln. The movie illustrates the fact that politics hasn't really changed since the Civil War. It's all about quid pro quo.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I clicked on this app....and I have no idea how to use it or what it's for!~  I'm a new kindle owner and certainly not savvy to any of this new-fangled technology.  I'm obviosly NOT a kid. But...give me time and ask again, maybe by then I'll know what I'm doing!  :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would limit my review to Wow if I could. I loved this book. Great story, characters, writing, and some twists-- some I saw coming, some I did not. Loved this book.
B000A42Y3M|4.0|It's an interesting toy, but my son hasn't taken to it yet. My son just likes to grab the egg on it.
B009R659L8|4.0|As usual Ms Clark has come up with another good one, always love her books because she throws so many characters in that it keeps you guessing to the end.
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent book that catches you right from the first page and will not let you go.  I devoured it and had to read it twice.  The movie (as always) was not as good but worth seeing as well.  Read the book first so the movie doesn't give the book's ending away.  I will read this one again as it is very well written.  All of Dan Brown's stuff is always an entertaining read.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I think once my granddaughter figures this game out, she will have a lot of fun with it, but<br />it's taking her awhile to catch on.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app. for keeping things that you come across daily, filed in to easily accessible folders for viewing later.  One of my most favorite apps and most utilized.  Thanks Evermore team!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The book kept me on my seat hoping for a different outcome. I had downloaded it onto my Kindle just before flying overseas, and I read the entire time. It's a beautiful love story and completely unexpected.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|I am a student who is interested in the issues that the author addresses in this book. That being said, I could hardly put this book down. In spite of the violence and tragedy which pervades the novel, the author takes time to create an accurate representation of Afghanistan in the modern era, describing its history and cultural heritage. While at times chilling and sobering, the author offers a simple tale of hope in the context of warring factions in Afghanistan, as well as the rule of the Taliban. I can only hope that more people read his works and sympathize with the civilians who are caught up in war- which is tragic, regardless of the side their government happens to be on.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|But that is always the case. The movie was great entertainment. The book is a great story of addiction and mental illness and should be read by everyone who knows or lives with a bi-polar person
1451668945|3.0|This book was not as good as previous novels written by Mary Higgins Clark.  The book was so/so plot-wise and the character development was shotty.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cant wait for the next season. I love this series. I would and do recommend to to any one.

B00AZRBLHO|4.0|I like several ideas from the book:<br />* find work commitments and control it;<br />* no single point of failure (Brent);<br />* backup of critical resources (Brent): knowledge sharing (3 Sr.Ops), documenting, etc;<br />* no waste time on late hand-off between Devs and Ops: deployment automation on virtual environments;<br />* clear understanding of need of &#34;internal&#34; Ops projects;
B002G1YPH0|3.0|I mounted this cooler on an Intel I-7 processor in an ASUS P8Z77 motherboard.  The mb would not post and the memory LED light stayed on indicating a problem with memory.  After contacting ASUS, I followed their directions about checking for bent cpu pins (no pins on this processor) and erasing the cmos.  The problem persisted.<br /><br />Then I noticed that the mb would post if the pc case were laying on its side but would not post if the pc case was in the upright (default) position.  This led me to discover that if I put a slight amount of pressure on the cooler (pushing it towards the cpu)while the pc case is in the upright position, the mb would post.  Apparently while the pc case is in the upright position and the cooler is then perpendicular to the pc case and motherboard, the heavy cooler causes the cpu to dislodge just enough to cause the aforementioned symptoms.<br /><br />I have tightened all the screws on the cooler mounting assembly but I suspect that any jarring or movement of the pc case may cause the problem again.  I may go back to the Intel supplied cooler, just to be safe.

0321885112|3.0|Mike Rohde is very talented, and I love what he is doing with visual note-taking. It's a cool concept and I'm glad he's sharing it . . . just wish it would have been via a different medium. This book, despite some pretty good content, has some big drawbacks:<br /><br />* Way too expensive. You could buy three books that will give you more practical help then this one for the price.<br />* Too repetitive. It's visual note-taking . . . cool, but not rocket science. Book is stretched too thin, too often.<br />* All of the bios were interesting, but came across as more added filler.<br />* The one chapter of practical drawing help was good, but should have been longer.<br />* The section on different \\"architectures\\" of sketchnoting was way overexplained<br /><br />In the end, this book has some good ideas and material, and you will learn something . . . but would have been much better if it had just been a sketchnote itself, not a whole book that is stretched for content.

0307744434|2.0|The best way to describe this book is \\"STRANGE\\".  I never really understood it, I guess.  The circus is a magic circus, one that isn't really there and yet you can see it in your mind.  The author did a great job of describing the tents, the acts, and the smells but the characters were shallow leaving no connection between them and the reader.  The last 100 pages are the best of the book but they still leave you asking \\"huh\\"?<br /><br />I have read that we only use 20% of our brain capacity, so conceptually I'm wondering if the author was thinking that these things could be possible if we used more of our brains than we do.  I also wonder if this book is enjoyed by a much younger generation.  I guess I'll find out during our discussion at book club.  As for me, I wouldn't recommend.

B0027UY8B8|5.0|Much has been written about the various packages this series comes in. I've found none that deal with the Region Free edition. Manufactured & packaged in the UK, this is CLEARLY THE version to buy. It comes in a sturdy box containing not flimsy cardboard sleeves but regular Blu Ray/DVD containers, each holding 2 discs. Both versions of Razor are there, The Plan is not. A glossy booklet describing the major players & what episodes are on each disc accompanies the package.<br /><br />Everything that appears on discs manufactured on this side of the Pond are there & play as well. However, keep in mind not all Blu Ray players are created equal, especially 1st generation. Mine is Oppo's latest BDP 103D. I've heard tell Region Free discs (not necessarily these) won't play on certain models. If this bothers you, I recommend contacting Amazon to see what their policy is on this particular matter. Normally, once the cellophane is removed from the package, it's yours.<br /><br />At it's current price (some $20 below the price a year ago), it's a steal, especially considering the price we pay for our Region's version. If owning rather than renting is your ticket, but you've held back because of price, get this before it goes away.

B00BAYLQI0|4.0|There are times when it takes the making visual of the devastation that occurs in nature to drive home the need for our being more aware of the suffering of our fellowmen at the hands of natural disasters around the world.  Certainly THE IMPOSSIBLE  achieves that. On December 26, 2004 one of the most disastrous tsunamis in history devastated portions of Thailand, killing thousands of people and destroying the landscape and lives of many more. This is the story of a Spanish family living in Japan but vacationing in Thailand and how they coped and survived this impossible natural act. Of note the entire crew that made this film is from Spain, the original title of the film is LO IMPOSIBLE: Mar&iacute;a Bel&oacute;n shared her story which was transformed into a screenplay by Sergio G. S&aacute;nchez and the direction is by Juan Antonio Bayona. The cinematography is by &Oacute;scar Faura and the deeply moving musical score was written by Fernando Vel&aacute;zquez. For the film the family of note is British in origin but even their British background is secondary to the omni-national impact of the story.<br /><br />A regular family - Maria (Naomi Watts), Henry (Ewan McGregor) and their three children Lucas (a brilliant performance by Tom Holland), Simon (Oaklee Pendergast) and Thomas (Samuel Joslin) - travel to Thailand to spend Christmas in a villa on the coastline. After settling in and exchanging gifts, they go to the pool, like so many other tourists. A perfect paradise vacation until a distant noise becomes a roar. There is no time to escape from the tsunami; Maria and Lucas are swept in one direction, Henry, Thomas and Simon in another. Once the storm settles the story is the strength of character and of family and of love that is able to overcome the impossible odds that they will ever be united.<br /><br />The cast of the family is excellent but there are also very fine cameo roles by S&ouml;nke M&ouml;hring who plays another father desperately seeking his lost family, Geraldine Chaplin as an old woman who comforts the boys, and many others who move in and out of the story quickly. The film approaches two hours in length and in the mid portion it becomes repetitive and in need of some editing.  But in ways this adds to the incredible sense of tolerance and survival of the characters. The surprise of the film, once the emotional impact begins to subside, is the brilliance of the acting of Tom Holland as Lucas, the oldest son who has inherited his mother's medical acumen and is able to help everyone around him.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|One of my all time favorite books.  In the 15~ish months since I purchased it, I've read it 3 or 4 times and have recommended it to all of my \\"reading buddies\\".  It seems like I'm always on the hunt for the Abby/Travis feel in each new book I start.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I can't thank you enough for writing this book!<br /><br />The only other books I've ever felt compelled to shove so forcefully into other people's hands have been your Visible Ops series, and Adam Hartung's 'The Phoenix Principle - Creating Marketplace Disruption'.  The Phoenix Project feels like the capstone to all these.<br /><br />The Phoenix Project is a watershed piece of work!
B003NX75B8|4.0|I really loved how Green and Levithan used their own, very distinct voices, to create a story where there are two main characters- well, three really, because you have to count Tiny, because he's such a huge part of the book (no pun intended). After reading this, I had to find more of both author's work.  Fans of John Green might be relieved at the lighter nature of this story.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have a Vizio TV that I wanted to attach headphones to, however the audio output through the RCA jacks was almost nonexistent. They were obviously put there to attached to an amplifier. After researching for a solution I found this Fiio E5, however in the product description and in all the comments everyone was using this small amp to hook up to an M-3 player, laptop, ipod, etc. So I figured I would at least order one and try it out knowing that I could return it if it just didn't work. Well my first impression when opening the package was \\"my God this small little thing couldn't possibly do the job that I wanted it to do\\". I had envisioned something the size of a pack of cigarettes, not half the size of a pack of matches. Well, to my surprise it works perfectly. Hooked it up and now I have gained as much audio output to my headphones from the TV as I will ever need. I great little product which solved my problem of having almost no output from the two RCA audio jacks on the back of my TV to speak of. Would highly recommend it for this purpose.

0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg offers a powerful, fresh voice on the roles and challenges of both women and men professionally and personally in the world today. She says \\"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead\\" is not a memoir, although she has included stories about her life, it's not a self-help book, although she truly hopes it helps and it's not a book on career management, although she offers advice. It's only partly a feminist manifesto as she hopes it inspires both women and men who want to understand what a woman is up against so he can do his part to build an equal world.<br />She combines personal anecdotes with hard data and compelling research to cut through the layers of ambiguity and bias surrounding the lives and choices of working women. She says thirty years after<br />women became 50 percent of the college graduates in the United States, men still hold the vast majority of leadership positions in government and industry.<br />The 2003 Heidi/Howard study Sheryl cited was especially helpful. Two professors from universities in New York ran an experiment to test perceptions of men and women in the workplace. Half the students were assigned to read a story about a successful male venture capitalist called Howard. The other half read the same story but under the name of a female called Heidi. Although their accomplishments were identical the students said Howard came across as appealing and Heidi was seen as selfish and not \\"the type of person you would want to hire or work for.\\" Decades of subsequent research confirm the Heidi/Howard study. They show how success and likability are positively correlated for men and negatively correlated for women and how people are evaluated based on the stereotypes of gender, race, nationality and age. Sheryl believes this bias is at the very core of why women hold themselves back.<br />When a woman focuses on results rather than pleasing others, she's acting like a man. To protect themselves from being disliked, many women question their abilities, downplay their achievements and put themselves down before others can. Author Ken Auletta observed in his \\"New Yorker\\" article that for women \\"self-doubt\\" becomes a form of self defense.<br />Ken Chenault (CEO of American Express) told Sheryl he observed both men and women interrupting women at meetings and giving guys credit for an idea first proposed by a women. He said he now stops the meeting and points out the interruption. It makes participants think twice. Sheryl said she witnessed a similar incident at a business executive dinner. The guest of honor listened to and answered the men's questions politely but barked, \\"Let me finish!\\" and chastised the women for interrupting when they asked questions. A male CEO pulled Sheryl aside afterwards and said he noticed how the women were silenced.<br />Sheryl makes a compelling case for women to lean in, for being ambitious in any pursuit and to \\"Make their partner a real partner.\\" She says, \\"Career progression often depends upon taking risks and advocating for oneself - traits that girls are discouraged from exhibiting.\\" Women hold back in ways both big and small. They are hindered by the external barriers of society and the internal barriers that exist within themselves. They continue to internalize the cultural messages that say it's wrong for a women to be outspoken, aggressive, and more powerful than men. Lacking self-confidence and pulling back they lower their own expectations, do the majority of the housework and childcare, compromise career goals, and compared to their male colleagues, fewer aspire to senior positions. She says women's progress in achieving leadership roles has stalled, their voices are still not heard equally especially in the decisions that most affect their lives.<br />Sheryl is aware there is no one definition of success or happiness. \\"We each have to chart our own<br />course and define what goal fits our lives, values and dreams.\\" Her goal is to help empower both women and men make the shift, person by person, to a more equal world.<br />Sheryl is the chief operating officer of Facebook and is ranked on Fortune's list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in the World. In 2010, she gave an amazing TEDTalk where she described how women unintentionally hold themselves back in their careers. Her talk that encouraged women to \\"sit at the table,\\" seek challenges, speak their truth, take risks and pursue goals with gusto has been viewed more than two million times.<br />Sheryl's story is my story and I suspect the story of every woman.men and men make the shift, person by person, to a more equal world.<br />Sheryl is the chief operating officer of Facebook and is ranked on Fortune's list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and as one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in the World.

B00CDSVZHY|5.0|On the surface you have a meticulously crafted homage to the &#34;spaghetti western&#34; of the late '60s and 70's. From the<br />opening credits, to the soundtrack, to the &#34;Panavision&#34; vistas of the American southwest, central Spain, Mexico, or any<br />other place these old films were churned out, Django is determined to take us there.<br />Then, underneath the iconic story line of &#34;two good guys fight off 50 bad guys to save girl&#34;, lurks the real message that<br />we are all still feeling guilty about. The real history of the United States is built upon a heritage of horrific crimes against<br />humanity. The great cast, especially Christopher Waltz, almost distract us from this underlying theme. I look forward to<br />watching Django again and again. Thanks Quentin.

I didn't know that Tom Cruise had a voice that could knock out the excellent renditions of &#34;I Want to Know What Love Is&#34; and &#34;Pour Some Sugar on Me&#34; that he did and Julianne Hough & Diego Boneta duets are terrific!  My order was received in a timely fashion and in good condition.

I applaud Sheryl for bringing the conversation back to the forefront and engaging today's young women. We can't stop talking about women leaders or how to promote them if we want a balanced society.  Her book is well written, interesting (even for someone who has been through it before) and essential.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Out of the three apps I tried for editing Word documents, this one seemed like the best one. I don't know how well it handles other file types because I only use it for Word documents.<br /><br />My problem is it wants 1. Permission to load when the phone boots and 2. Permission to reorder applications. So I'm thinking those two permissions combined will make sure the app is always running, never shutting down even of you don't use it and the operating system should shut it down.<br /><br />So it will degrade the quality of every other app on the device. And since Facebook has the same permissions, I'd have to wonder what happens if both of them battle to be last in line to be shut down.<br /><br />So three stars because it is using unnecessary resources on my phone, but actually is good for Word files. I will still force close it when I'm done though.
B00881PTRC|3.0|The word category menu is far too small on the nexus 10.  Edit word lists is similarly affected.  The rest looks okay, however.
B00BF11STU|5.0|I've was totally into this movie from the beginning.  Loved the way the female lead (although young and new the CIA) pushed her way into being noticed when she was being treated as a &#34;newbie&#34; and shown little respect from the powers that be.  I thought the ending was short, but I understand the movie was about the 8 year struggle to find their target.  I really like this director.

B000001GH9|5.0|Instead of a formal review, I'll give you a couple of anecdotes to ponder.<br />In the rehearsal disc that accompanied the original LP box of Solti's recording of Tristan and Isolde, Birgit Nilsson caught herself having held high a note a little longer than prescribed in the score. Solti refused to re-make the scene, laughing and commenting: \\"What's half a second? Wagner never heard it as good!\\" When Yehudi Menuhin visited Bartok in New York in preparation of his performance of a Bartok sonata, Bartok was waiting for him, pencil in hand and without a word of greeting waited for Menuhin to get ready. They played the first movement, and at last Bartok stopped to look at the violinist and said, after a short pause: \\"I thought they played composer's music like this only after they're dead!'<br />A comment like this might have been appropriate in Chicago on the day of this recording.<br />Berg should have lived that long, so as to hear Mutter playing his concerto!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing and giving gifts to others that play as well.  Great variety of games to play, too! Come and join us!
B000007OTH|5.0|When we examine reasons and causes for the neglect of a composer who, in his own lifetime, enjoyed a great reputation, we tend often to forget the changes in society - trends, fashions and the rise to fame of rivals. Bruch acquired fame much earlier than Brahms (who suffered many years from the over-the-top encomium of Schumann). His Concerto in G minor became an instant \\"classic\\", so much so that he was invited by Sarasate to write another for him. But he decided to throw in his lot with opera and oratorio - to us a strange misconception of his own talents. He wanted to match Weber and outdo Wagner by writing a truly \\"national\\" German opera, which never came off as he hoped; and he produced several oratorios and \\"Liedertafel\\" opuses that fell by the wayside when the fashion for this kind of entertainment subsided. Apart from which they also suffered the debility of a brand of late romantic sentimentality that was already on the way out.<br />That's one fairly obvious cause for the dive in his reputation. Another, practically disregarded today, is the fact that music was mostly played at home in that era, which meant that you had to buy expensive scores and study them, before you could play them. Apart from the usual problems of serious composers having to contend in an open market with overtly popular music, there was the issue for aficiodos that so much money and effort would naturally focus on \\"the best\\". In this regard, Bruch was overtaken by Brahms and Dvorak in instrumental music, and eventually (as mentioned) also fell by the wayside in vocal music.<br />As a symphonist, he did not achieve the same high level of excellence as the two  competitors I just named. I think we should disregard Bruckner in this connection, who was hardly well known prior to his 7th Symphony. (We plaster his present fame on him retrospectively and anachronistically. In life, Bruckner influenced no-one.) Bruch steadfastly maintained the tradition of Schumann and Mendelssohn, going beyond them only in terms of (slightly) advanced harmonic diction and some dilution of the formal symphonic genre. This can bring on a sense of deja-vu on first hearing, it's all so easy on the ear and this can deceive us that there areno depths to be discovered. Yet the music is brilliantly crafted, extremely melodious, beautifully orchestrated and rhythmically surprisingly bold. If we ignore the timeline and place him side by side with his forebears, we might on closer acquaintance come to the view that at least two of his symphonies are superior specimens of that art than what Schumann bequeathed on us! However, I will leave that as a mere suggestion, because it is obviously an opinion that can be argued for or against until the cows come home.<br />His 1st Symphony is clearly an apprenticeship exercise, with loads of padding whenever Bruch lost the thread of the symphonic argument. Despite this weakness it is a pretty good Symphony No. 1 when compared to many others! The strongest of the three is No. 2, a very bold and dramatic production with a stark, almost tragic feel to it. This is the work where he comes closest to seriously challenging Brahms - it is (to my mind) a work of equal merit to Brahms' First; but Brahms of course went on to compose No. 4, which left Bruch far behind.<br />No. 3 is the most approachable of the trio. Based on sketches that precede even No. 1, it has a young and vibrant texture and a slow movement of almost voluptuous erotic intensity. It was written, by the way, for the New York Philharmonic, although Bruch could not accede to the invitation to conduct the world premiere owing to prior obligations.<br />These works have not been recorded often enough. So many of Schumann and Mendelssohn, not to mention Saint-Saens, Franck, Bizet and lesser lights; so few of Bruch! My first ever Bruch symphony was an RCA LP of the Louisville Orchestra and Jorge Mester, which made no impact whatever, nor did it anything for me. Marco Polo had one or theother poverty-stricken recording available (some reappearing on the Naxos label). None of this was conducive to improving Bruch's repute as a symphonist. The situation has improved somewhat of late, but hardly enough!<br />So we today have the choice of Masur, Conlon and a handful of single discs.<br />I will begin with Masur, who is far and away the best craftsman and the most sympathetic interpreter of these symphonies; moreover he has far and away the best orchestra at his command of all rivalling issues. I will merely draw attention to the majesty and inexorable propulsion of his No. 2, and the sheer exuberance of his rhythmic textures in No. 3, which also features a red-hot sensual climax for the slow movement of this symphony. The sound quality is not the best, judging by our standards; but it is clear, warm and natural, hardly subject to complaints.<br />Conlon cannot aspire to rivalry here. He is too cool and uninvolved and somehow seems to miss the essence of Bruch's style altogether. His rhythms sound fussy and laboured, and the orchestral execution is also somewhat below par. This set is not competitive when measured against the Masur recordings. Although at first hearing the sound itself seems better than Masur's, on extended listening an artifical hardness manifests itself that becomes the more unpleasant as it goes on.<br />Far more serious work comes from Hickox (London Symphony) on Chandos, although the conductor died before he could complete the cycle. In both No. 1 and 3, he provides a serious challenge to Masur. But he does not displace his rival - not only because No. 2 is missing, but also because Hickox's style is more subdued, less passionate, indeed in greater proximity to Brahms than to Bruch! His rhythms are not as well sprung as we get from Masur; and the \\"love interest\\" in No. 3 seems to leave him cold. Maybe he didn't realise this was love music? As it is he did not get around to No. 2, the touchstone of Bruch stature as a symphonist, where the Brahmsian flavour might have spoken in his favour. Of the two symphonies he published, I can only say that they are fine reading, but lack ultimate conviction. He does, however, enjoy the gamorous sound of Chandos and the company of Mordkovitch, who plays two of the violin concertos as fill-ups to each disc. However, I can't consider these other than to note in passing that Masur's Accardo is by far the better fiddler of the two.<br />So where we stand, it has to be acknowledged that Masur's recording of the symphonies remains first choice. Indeed I am inclined to the view that this set belong among his best recordings.
B0000AM6IY|2.0|I have no idea why anyone would want this outdated technology other than for its retro look. Pan n scan sucks royally. You lose 1/3 of the screen!
B0000069CT|4.0|As a complete set this needs to fear no rivalry. It is a classic in its own right; and as far as I know, there is no other complete issue anyway. However, it does not maintain the same high level of excellence throughout, and arguably the collector might do better buying single issues -- for two reasons.<br />Bruch's concertos after the Scottish Fantasy exhibit a marked downturn in the level of inspiration. His ideas convey the impression that they are the fruit of hard labour and they lacks the easy spontaneity of the other works in the genre. So you might not be inclined to submit yourself to them more than once, from curiosity perhaps. Certainly I feel that hearing them for the third or fourth time, boredom takes over at the predictability of the course of these works, and the impression of forcing inspiration gets stronger.<br />I don't want to discourage anyone who likes complete sets. I've already agreed it is a classic. But lovers of Bruch's better known concertos will find in No. 2 a far more sensitive interpreter with Perlman on EMI, who also includes the Scottish Fantasy in a wonderful performance. The latter work is also available in superb readings by Oistrakh and Heifetz. For No. 1 the choice is wide. But to stay in Leipzig, there is Vengerov with Masur in an indubitably more elegant and refined reading that Accordo gives here. More recommendations are probably unnecessary. But my 4 stars simply reflect the state of the market, where those items which would be of primary interest to a buyer are placed among some of the hottest competition of any music!

0792839714|4.0|I vaguely remembered seeing this movie as a kid & decided to get it on DVD. This movie was everything I expected from this era. These two friends travel to a resort which has three areas, one is a mideval world, one is a Greek world, & the other is a western world (or West World as they call it). All three of the worlds have robots which appear human & are programmed to allow people to live out their fantasy. However, there's a glitch in the system. One of the villans played by Yul Brynner, goes haywire & starts killing people. Before long, all the computer controlled characters start killing people. When James Brolin's friend gets killed, he must do what he can to survive & escape Westworld.

It's too bad that a writer like a magnificent writer like John Green doesn't get noticed by people other than young adults.  He is an artist!  His writting is so real so down to earth.  He has the uncanny ability to write from the point of view of a sick teenage girl!  Yet he doesn't make her silly or stupid.  He treats his characters and readers with respect and with love!  I am a new fan and a forever fan.  I will be borrowing all of his other books from my daughter now too.
B00AQLGXTU|3.0|I quite enjoyed The Selection. It had the potential to be a real social satire, though never reached Austenian heights. But this book rehearses  lot of the vagaries of relationship. I got sick to death of her dithering over Maxom vs Apen. I kept wanting to shake her and say &#34; Lady America, if you can't choose, you don't really love either of them&#34;. Also, the ease with which rebels keep breaking into the palace makes you wonder about the capacity of the military. Yet there were aspects that point to real potential. In the first book, girl's were sent home on a regular basis. This gave the story some tension. In this volume, only one girl leaves and that isn't by the usual route. I'm trying to avoid spoilers here, but the relationship between Maxom and his father does provide one shocking moment. I think this series would have done better as a two book series, keeping the action taut and excising some of the repetitive relationship issues. That said, this is a book for YA so it may be directed to the angst of adolescent romances.
B004UXY5D6|5.0|I came across this while browsing through the Amazon site, and I must say this group and specifically this album is something that took me pleasantly by surprise. I am an old Skynyrd and country/southern rock fan from way back, and you just don't find a lot quality acts in this day and age that are in that ballpark. Whiskey Myers fits that bill and then some. I seem to enjoy Firewater more each time I play it and look forward to their next recording with great anticipation. For those that don't...&#34;I guess that's something you don't understand&#34;.

B008D4AKYQ|5.0|This album is fantastic from start to finish, without a weak song. I'd never heard of Big Big Train until happening upon this compilation on iTunes. After listening to snippets, every song intrigued me to the point that I chose to buy the CD instead of just grabbing a couple tracks. Anyway, I'm glad I did. For such an outstanding album, we should be able to view the artwork and read the lyrics if we can. All the songs have an interesting story to tell of the people and places that are part of their lives, and how the world has changed in a generation. Each track is unique; well composed with beautiful melodies and interesting tempo changes.  Overall musicianship is superb (the dudes can play), providing some cool riffs without the gratuitous shredding solos. Lead vocals are strong and perfectly emotive, while the harmonies soar. English Electric, Part 1, is an inspired album, reminiscent of thematic albums of the 70s by groups like Genesis and the Strawbs. If you like this, check out their other stuff, especially Part 2, and The Underfall Yard.

B0000TAZBK|3.0|I love every note. I can feel every instrument. In fact, I know the music so well I see and envision each scene as the tracks play on. What is most disappointing about this Box Set is the way it is described when you order it. It says, Enhanced Limited Edition Version with exclusive Trading cards. Three Discs from the Original Trilogy. What it does not tell you is that the Slip Cover is the only thing enhanced at all. I already have these three scores in the same Plastic Cases as I originally bought them. Thus, it is quite deceptive to think you are getting some newly mixed or remaster gems like the extremely rare and more expensive Complete Scores that I have on one of. In any case, I bought it, and I already have it, but that is due to marketing, not a seller trying to sell something the buyer might already have. I will gift it, but very disappointed that it was not a Book Form Set with discs matching the slip cover and with a more unique style. I could have easily just bought the MP3 Versions all over again and spent about the same. Still, it is Howard Shore, so the music alone is worth the cost. that is my honest opinion and after buying hundreds of Movie Scores I was actually tricked this first time into buying something I am found wanting to give away...
0385341008|5.0|I love the way this book is written.  There are letters written among the characters that gives us a more intimate perspective as opposed to reading words on a page.  I enjoyed the book and loved the characters.  You can't help but fall in love with them and their eclectic manner.
B007REV4YI|5.0|You can forget Connery. You can give Moore the Boot. Dalton is left out in the cold. And Brosnan, is well, okay. But Daniel Craig and the entire cast make this mournful, dark, and even humanized version of James Bond the best ever. Not only is there no silly and campy parts to this third Craig installment, it actually makes you FEEL like this Bond Movie deserved a Best Picture and Actor and Best Supporting Actress/Actor nod. It is right up there with LOTR, Return of the King. Oscar worthy, but it did not get the praise it deserved. This Bond will reboot the next generation of Bond lovers to go back to theaters, unless they have no pulse of course. Great movie and in Blu Ray it is stunning!
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Totally discussting. The language, the characters, the plot, were unrealistic. No wonder this movie was not allowed to be shown in Japan, it is insulting and offensive to all humanity.

I think this movie is so good it could challenge Public Enemies as my favorite gangster movie.

B00APYUPB0|5.0|I'm not a big fan of reissues and given the previous one (The Wake) included exactly the same tracks as the original album with no remix plus three discs of extras including demos and alternative versions I was more than hesitant about the Tales from the Lush Attic reissue. After a couple of months I decided to purchase a copy and oh god how wrong was I!!!<br /><br />This is no attempt to make a few extra bucks by rehashing older material, on the contrary, this is as good as it gets. The package is beautiful, completely new artwork which captures the essence of the original release and takes it one step further and lots of interviews  and impressions from the 80s by former and current band members plus some impressions from Mike Holmes who was the man behind this reissue.<br /><br />The album itself sounds completely enhanced and it is such a joy to listen to it in all its glory.  All instruments have been remixed (and some even re-recorded) but they still sound faithful to the original spirit of the album.  The drums sounds much much better than the original and all the intricacies come across wonderfully proving what a great drummer Paul Cook is.  The Bass is also much improved and many arrangements that were not noticeable in the original mix are back and they sound amazing.  At times the bass sound is reminiscent of Chris Squire and Geddy Lee and that speaks volumes by itself.  Keyboards sound gigantic and more atmospheric than we were used to.  Besides there are some riffs and solos that were erased by mistake from the original 1983 mix but are recovered here adding more depth and beauty to the music.  Guitars were given the same treatment and they're amazing, too!<br /><br />The only element which is retained from the original mix were the vocals by Peter Nicholls which were originally recorded in one or two takes max.  Therefore a re-recorded vocals would have been a good addition to this project.  However, that's a minor complaint considering what incredible and surprising reissue this is.<br /><br />I thoroughy recommend this reissue to every IQ fan.  In fact, I will never again listen to my remastered edition CD and will only listened to this reissue since it is as faithful as one can expect to the original record but sounding up to today's standards.  And I haven't even watched the extra DVD yet.<br /><br />500% recommended!!!and surprising reissue this is.<br /><br />I thoroughy recommend this reissue to every IQ fan.

B0087EVHTE|5.0|This processor is fast, reliable and great for gaming. Handles everything I can throw at it. I've been playing with a GTX 660 and running SC2, Hitman Absolution and Sleeping dogs on the highest settings.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|not a bad little game.  I wish games like this didn't use two and three types of currency. I'd be a lot more likely to buy coin packs if there was only one type of coin.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This was a great deal for all of these batteries.<br />Replaced batteries on all garage key fabs and car keys.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I think I'm in love with Jamie! Can not wait to read all the books in the series. A must read.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|For the first time I downloaded this game I was sceptical but it's actually good. I have to get used to play it but it's fun. My daughter plays it as well and she enjoys it very much.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is a good book. You should buy it and read it now. If you don't I will kill you
B0053O89KG|4.0|this is a terrific series fun and mystery both can't wait for series 5 to arrive  and complete our set
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Flight is a thriller with strong political & moral subtexts that is undeniably genius. the action on the plane with Denzel is intense and entertaining however sad because there were lives lost. John Goodman's character is fun. The finale was unpredictable with a nice surprise ending. I love it and believe you will too. I rented Flight a couple of times and finally made the decision to add it to my library for good. SKC. 04.24.13.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great finish to a Fantastic series. I loved the way all the story lines were wrapped up. There were a few twists I did not expect. Great job.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a good game. great for passing time of you know what i mean..i just want the stupid points mam
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book is better than the movie(like in most cases). It gives you a lot more inside to the storie. Easy read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great step forward from the first game by using dips and hills, gaps and rappelling. They took it a step further from the linear landscape and sharp 90&deg; turns of the first game and used more 3D terrain.
0443069522|4.0|I failed anatomy the first time for lack of preparation. This time around I used Gray's Anatomy and I learned more from this book than any other lectures I've had!
1616550414|5.0|I loved how everything was divided, it's very easy to read despite all the information it contains. It's really a must for Zelda fans.
B0086700CM|5.0|I only played this a little bit and it was fun. Fast paced game. I prefer word games not racing games. My daughter can't stop playing this game.
0743270754|5.0|I gave this to a good friend and he is loving it.  The politics back then was ever so much more interesting and the communication was a lot slower, every person who could vote was totally involved.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|The game wouldn't upload to my tablet. It kept locking up my tablet. I Couldn't even play it. Don't know if it's a good game or not.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play this game almost every day to shift gears from work to being at home and relaxing.  I am not a gamer, so don't really care about getting the highest score, just having fun figuring the game out and focusing on something.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Too easy for me. It would be a great child's game. Still fun, just not for me. Other games are similar.
B00CAJP0ZO|1.0|Still scratching my head at this Grammy winning \\"artist\\".  The Black Eyed Peas are bad enough...well, REAL bad.  But this dreck is so painfully inane that you lose hope for musical humanity.<br /><br />Saw him on \\"Dancing With The Stars\\" recently & it was embarrassing.  Lame break moves, ridiculous pants & lyrics SO pitiful a middle school kid could write better.  Not to mention the incredibly overused electronic vocal nonsense.<br /><br />Now let me get this straight...this guy has won a boatload of Grammys with lyrics such as the following which appear on this travesty...<br /><br />\\"I be rockin' wit u. We are buring brighter than the sun tonight when I'm rockin' wit u. So everybody have fun tonight, cause I just wanna have fun tonight wit u.\\"<br /><br />\\"Say hell yeah, this is love, this is love, this is love.\\"<br /><br />\\"They watching us. I wanna scream & shout & let it out.\\" (repeated over & over & over)(ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY KIDDING ME???).  Then add no talent Britney Spears using some lame British accent & recycling her shining moment phrase \\"It's Britney Beotch\\".  Is this supposed to be a comedy album?<br /><br />\\"We gettin' dumb.\\"<br /><br />\\"Here we go, here we go, here we here we go.\\"<br /><br />\\"Igloo, igloo, igloo...cool...big willy stay chilly...my money so funny it's silly.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly.\\"<br /><br />\\"You pick me up when I fall down.\\" (Wow, original!)<br /><br />\\"In the ghetto, in the ghetto, in the ghetto\\" (as sung by a little kid)...then he goes into some diatribe about crappy parents & the perpetuation of the same cliches that unfortunately persist in America...I'll tell you what brother, this crap music isn't helping.<br /><br />Seriously...this is the best you have to offer Mr. Grammy?  A Grammy certainly doesn't mean much anymore if this stuff qualifies.<br /><br />All the progress in America & this is the kind of stuff we are feeding the masses?  Dr. Martin Luther King would be so proud (especially for the pathetic grammar).  This is what he fought for?  A mockery of all his triumphs.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor & find some REAL music.  There are 1000's of starving artists with talent.  Why patronize garbage?  If people keep buying crap, that's what they'll keep making.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  For the sake of humanity...dig for some better music.  It's out there...they just don't play it on the pathetic radio.<br /><br />ZERO STARS...Pitiful.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like other Solitaire games. It's fun and I keep winning the game. Still challenging though. I will play it more often.
0307389839|4.0|I'm a tough audience when it comes to essays. I've only read two collections in the last 6 years. One was  [[ASIN:0307275019 Point to Point Navigation: A Memoir]] which I would never have read were the author not Gore Vidal. The other was more typical, [[ASIN:0143121243 The Idea of America: Reflections on the Birth of the United States]]  presented interesting topics, but a good essay or two was packed between a lot of filler.  In other collections, I cringe as essays ramble or serve as vanity pieces.<br /><br />Like a Marukami novel this book of essays is quirky and satisfying.  I liked the unifying theme. Strangely I thought the last essay was the weakest.<br /><br />Marukami tells about how marathon running is done. He explains why, but to a non-runner like myself, the cost-benefit ratio does not seem balanced. It's endless. Distance logs. Shoes.  Pain. Even massages hurt. Knees give out. Legs give out when you don't expect it. After a double marathon race, he couldn't walk for two days. There is a discussion of aging and diminishing performance.<br /><br />There are many observations on life and his work. I learned a lot about him. He once owned a jazz bar. Now  he obsessively collects jazz and pop albums and CDs, hence the many references to music in his work. He's run 26 marathons and participated in 4 triathlons. He's translated quite a number of classics from English to Japanese.<br /><br />Buried in here is an autobiography. For Murakami his running, like his writing, is part of who he is.<br /><br />This is an unusual look at a gift writer who has spanned cultures with his literature..
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Not sure what all the fuss was about this film.....I found it plodding and actually boring in places.  Great theme and idea.  Just not played out well on the screen.
B000002KB8|5.0|they were a bunch of young men blazing a trail. this is raw and bold for its time. i bought this album when it first came out and still love the opening bell and rain on the first track Black Sabbath
B009IEXKXI|5.0|So refreshing to read something voiced and plotted so convincingly, with astronauts who behave and react like the professionals they are deeply trained to be. The rich vein of dark humor and the authentic thought and speech of the characters was a consistent highlight. The scientific depth and detail was extraordinary.<br /><br />Slightly brings to mind Arthur C Clark's 'A fall of moon dust' and James Blish' 'Welcome to Mars', but done so much better than either of these.<br /><br />A remarkable read.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun game! Great for the bored star wars junkie. Game stability is good too. It has never caused my kindle to crash
034580404X|5.0|Read all three, just fantasy but fn.  the third one is the best.  I don't believe a word of it however, not realistic
B000PMG16U|5.0|These movies are great! When folks grew up on Hope, Empire & Jedi, they were just kids! When it was time for Menace, Clones & Sith, they expected star wars to grow too! Revenge of the Sith is the only star wars film to be rated PG-13, so far, yet it wasn't enough to please most of the first generation of fans! They wanted new movies rated R or Hardcore NC-17!<br /><br />Had the internet existed in 1977, there would be just as many bad reviews for the sequels to Menace, Clones & Sith! Had they been filmed in chronological order, they would be hating Hope, Empire & Jedi!<br />People argued that star wars didn't belong to George Lucas even when they stopped buying home videos in 1997, but that doesn't hold up in Court<br /><br />Until now! George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney, now they aren't his films! I doubt episode seven will get the R rating, so I'm sure it'll have just as many bad reviews! May 2015 feels like a long way from now!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|exactly what i ordered, requested 2 day shipping received in perfect condition the next day. Not to mention this is one of the best shows on tv right now. highly recommend this to anyone.
B005H9B44A|4.0|A very good entertaining film with a good, though not at times believable and congruent storyline. The main characters are neither all good nor all bad in the tradition of the Greeks and this renders them sympathetic and heroic at the same time. The relatonship between Thor and his father captures the essence of today's troubled families and is one of the few movies to break out of the old cliche of the younger son emerging victorious in the end. I reccomend the movie to old and young alike and urge families to watch it together for its entertainment value and also what it adds to the conversation about the challenges facing families today.
B005T87QCI|1.0|My son loves playing this on my kindle. However every time there is an update to the game it locks up and will not load then we are forced to uninstall then reinstall it. Then any in game content we have bought for it, for example the 7 extra robots plus a build you own, does not redownload into your account so you are forced to either buy it again or do without. Please find a way to fix this!
0525953728|3.0|Disclaimer first - this review is only on the contents of the book and nothing else. Specifically, the undercurrents and the events leading up to this point have not influenced this review. The tragedy of 9/11 was monumental and thousands of families suffered. This review is not about 9/11.<br /><br />My expectations from the book were satisfied to an extent - the maps, the hours leading up to the flight, and the sequence of events once the SEALs landed in the compound provided sufficient material. However, counterbalanced with what has already been shown on TV, the only advantage was reading the book at my own pace probably.<br /><br />The book talks about characters that did not participate in the event. Reality could often be less suspenseful than what we have been fed by the likes of Robert Ludlum, Alistair McLean, Ken Follet and others that specialize in the genre. I recall a fight from Ken Follet's 'Lie dowm with the lions' where the Afghans are repelling an attack by Soviet helicopters. It was hair raising amd I must have read that part a couple times. It gripped and did not let go until it was over. No equivalence here.<br /><br />Or, a couple of lines from another novel read in my teens .. \\"At 500 yards, his aim was accurate. At 200 yards, deadly\\". No single line stands out in the writing here,<br /><br />While it is understood that the author must hide details for the sake of national security, the overall effect is that the book comes out as average.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Agent Pendergast is back with the usual cast of characters for an adventure that does not disappoint.  If you enjoy this series, then this next book is worth getting.  A tale of revenge that puts a nice end-hopefully- to the whole Helen debacle, but still leaves some tantalizing possibilities for future tales, such as will Pendergast and Viola ever get back together? One can always hope!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was a great partner to reading fifty shades. Amazing story and well written. Doesn't make you wait long for the story to get good....
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I think the book displays a awesome young lady with a journey worth sharing with others.  God has truly blessed her life and she has the chance to share with others (thousands) including my life. I think sometimes we forget that nothing else seems to matter<br />when it comes to religion,race and culture. Anita really inspired me with her journey and I will truly share with other friends.<br />Thanks a Million<br />Texas
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The entire cast has been stellar so far, especially the two leads.  I was initially a little upset about the choice to cast Freddy as a woman but after a few episodes I realized that it really doesn't matter.  The character is just as slimy whether male or female.  And every meal is a little squirm inducing.  Amazed that they can maintain this level of macabre interest on NBC.
0307472841|1.0|As an author I found the structure of The Man from Bejing sadly out of balance. It begins with a horrific mass murder in a tiny Swedish hamlet in the north. This certainly gets the readers' attention, but the motivation of the killer is not credible, nor it is likely that a powerful Chinese capitalist would commit such a crime, killing innocent people in a far away place. The author's intention is garbled, for much of the book is devoted to a political polemic contrasting Maoist ideology with China today. It is always an error to push a political ideology in a work of fiction. The Swedish protagonist, a judge with a past in pro-Mao ideology, is hardly believable, and her own actions are to my mind illogical and unbelievable. When mugged in China she doesn't share the news with her roommate, which is the obvious course of events. After a very long diversion into history of Chinese laborers on the building of the railroad during the Gold Rush to somehow justify revenge over a hundred years later without revealing fthe actual reason for the need for revenge, to me was a cop-out. The Swedish protatonist bumbles along unconvincingly. Her failing marriage is hardly reconstructed as she is not proactive and doesn't seem to care very much. (I first read a sample on my Kindle, then turned to Amazon for a used copy for one cent plus postage.) I can't understand how this could be touted as a best seller unless it rode on the coattails of the author's previously very successful mysteries. I found reading it dreary and disappointing. Save your money..
030759565X|4.0|Beautiful book, arrived in excellent condition.<br />Photos are great.<br />Lots of desserts!<br />Some recipes are split on two pages; not the most convenient way to follow a recipe.<br />Have made several; favorite heart-stuffed shells in lemon ricotta bechamel. To die for!!<br />The book is also fun to read; the authors personality comes thru and she is quite funny.<br />I would definitely recommend this book!
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|From start to finish, M83 did an amazing job composing this soundtrack. It really captures the emotion of the movie, and the credits sequence track just rocks!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Lovely, sad book.  I am so glad I read this.  Highly recommend.  I didn't know much about this part of history and was surprised by what I learned.  It would be a good addition to a high school curriculum on the Holocaust.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Cool Cool Cool  I love this band.  They are so multifunctional it is awesome.  This is a 5 start plus album and I recommend it to anyone who is o=into a band who is a mulitasker
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a great book about one of the most influential people of the baby boom generation. Everyone can benefit from reading this book as it contains many insights about leadership, relationships and the iconic products that have made Apple a market leader. Isaacson had access to nearly everyone in Jobs' life and the first hand accounts from his interviews make for fascinating reading.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Despite being 720p instead of 1080p, the video quality of this Blu-ray was more than good enough not to distract from the presentation or the story being told.  Although the story of the other Earth is almost just a bookend to the drama within, this is still a great solid, human story.  I bought this never having seen the movie, just based on reviews, but was not disappointed.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Such an amazing move and effects are spectacular! And the story is so inspiring. Highly recommend for everyone! Great, great movie!!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|great app for fun, its addicting and colorful.  made for adults that are kids at heart. enjoy to the fullest.
076421120X|3.0|Darlene Zschech's daily devotional, Revealing Jesus, comes wrapped in a beautiful green hard cover, with splashes of gold.  From the outside, the book is very desireable and is definitely gift giving quality.  The inside of the book continues to draw you with its colors and nicely designed pages.  Each month begins with a two page opener.  You can easily follow through the days of the month by locating the date at the top of each page.  The devotions begin with a scripture, followed by a short devotional, and closed with a prayer or thought.  The author seeks to expose the reader to a deeper understanding of the nature and character of God, as well as encourage personal reflection and growth.  The devotions are short, taking less than 2-3 minutes to read.<br /><br />I think that this book would be a great addition to your regular Bible study, but should not replace the reading of God's Word.  I did find that for myself, personally, it was somewhat lacking.  Having read other devotionals, such as Streams in the Desert, I was really looking for a little deeper thought.  However, as I stated, it is still a very nice book.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book to review for Bethany House Publishers.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|In my personal opinion, good artistry can make up for tired, boring story. The Illusionist is not a particularly good plot. It's been done to death, and most of the plot beats are very predictable. Nothing interesting is done character wise, and there is very little character development. This is a just a costume drama, but luckily it is a very well made costume drama. The performances from all of the major cast (including the usually wooden Jessica Biel) were very good. The set design and the costumes are all stunning, and the score is effective and works well with the mood in every scene. If you want to see a well made if somewhat predictable movie, this one is worth a watch in my opinion.
B00881PTRC|3.0|Today's Amazon.com free app of the day (April 24, 2013) is Ultimate Hangman HD.<br /><br />This is an Android version of the classic word game, Hangman.  Since this game has been online on sites like AOL since its early days and since most people know how to play Hangman, I won't bother going into details on how to play Hangman.  You can always look it up online if you are one of the few that are unfamiliar with the game Hangman.<br /><br />Instead I want to focus on what I think about this version of Hangman. I have concluded that this app is meant to be an Educational/Game type app by the app developer Ensenasoft, and that is exactly what the problem with it is.  It is OK at both but does not do a really good job at being either type of app.<br /><br />Like other previous free app of the day titles that Ensenasoft has offered, there are different \\"skins\\" including a holiday one.  Again another sign that this is a product trying to be many different things.  They included a feature after the word is revealed that allows you to go to one of the dictionary websites to look up the definition of the word you just tried to guess.  This is one sign of the attempt to make this app educational.  There are also words used in this Hangman game that are unfamiliar to most such as colugo or a narwahl under the animal category.  Imagine an episode of Wheel of Fortune where the puzzle is colugo or narwahl.  It isn't going to happen because Wheel of Fortune doesn't do puzzles of animals that are very rare or that are not usually found in the US.  Using words like colugo or narwahl is good for educational value, but not for game value since very few people would actually be able to guess it.<br /><br />But they also try to make this a game by putting in some nice animations of the stickman as he is being drawn.  But other than those nice animations in the one theme or skin, there is not much that makes this seem like the \\"Ultimate\\" Hangman app.  Any other hangman app is about thesame as this one without the nice stick figure animations.<br /><br />Therefore, it is an OK game but I don't think it lives up to the Ultimate label given to it.  Since it feels like Ensenasoft was trying to cover both the educational and game aspects of Hangman but didn't really focus on either one, I have to give this 3 stars since I can't give a 3 and a half rating which would have been more accurate of a rating for this game and because 4 stars would be a bit too much for this game in its current format.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great game can't waite for more. Beautiful grafics and very addictive I could not put it down. I would recommend to all my friends. The only way it could have been better is if it had more levels
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Really enjoyed this story.... Weird to say a book about two teens with cancer is funny, but their sarcasm and intellect helps them through their battles and leaves you smirking along with them. I would definitely suggest it to a friend
B000FC1LOC|5.0|I understand the loss of someone dying from cancer. I lost my mother in 9 months and we didn't have options like Kate has had. I just feel so connected with the family when they're told they need to say good bye, but this book took a huge turn from the movies perspective.
B005HF0GKC|5.0|I loved every season of &#34;Medium,&#34; but I thought this one was full of exceptionally well-written episodes. Later, in the series the episodes started dealing too much with family problems. Not this first season. It's all about the Allison stories. Very well done.
B003LXT8YC|5.0|The other three albums I reviewed by Ms. LaVette were the same.  I had little to add.  This album I'd give six stars.  I know all of these songs from my childhood in the sixties and seventies.  She gives &#34;Isn't it a Pity&#34; emotion George Harrison just brushed over.  The Moody Blues &#34;Nights in White Satin&#34; becomes powerfully emotional.  What the Moody Blues did with sweeping orchestration, Betty does with her voice and a piano.  I just loved every one of her interpretations.
B006XOBFB0|5.0|Murray is a wonderful pianist. We love his elegant and beautiful interpretation of Mozart. Highly recommended. And the price is amazing as well.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|My introduction to Adele came with Rolling in the Deep.  I was an instant fan.  The quality of the her voice, her writing, the quality of the production just grabbed me and I went to my computer and brought it up on youtube to listen to it a dozen more times then made my wife listen to it.  The video was well done too.  Since then, I've come to admire her story as well as her song craft.  I buy an album based on liking at least three songs a lot and a few other songs a little bit.  Set Fire to the Rain is brilliant poetry and she sings it in a way that takes me back to Dusty Springfield singing Windmills of Your Mind, or Barbara Streisand singing almost anything. &#34;Rumor has It&#34; is just brilliant and the surprise ending made me laugh out loud in my car.  Someone Like You and Turning Tables are just icing on a delicious auditory cake.  I like all of these songs, but the five stars are for the ones I truly love.
B0053O89RY|4.0|Fast shiping! Did not come with sleeve as specified and one slight disc issue (one episode played rough). But very satisfied with overall purchase. Would happily do business with them again.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|I'm 55 and since I received my first record player, it has been my habit to buy LPs, albums is the best description, if I liked three or more songs a lot.  Just Give Me a Reason, Try, and Blow Me fell into that category.  I like most of the other songs, and won't criticize the one I didn't.  An album is a trip to the buffet and the price of the plate is based on what you really wanted the most.  After 33  years of marriage, Try reminded me of the times my wife and I wondered if &#34;it was worth it&#34;, and we're both glad we decided to 'Try'.<br />Just Give Me a Reason with the lines, &#34;We're not broken we're just bent', fall in that same category.  Divorce is a long term solution to short term problems in many cases.  Blow Me is just another one of Pink's incredibly well written songs.  I have listened to Pink since &#34;Just Like a Pill&#34; and admire her song crafting even when her language makes me cringe a bit.  The foundations of her music are strong and she decorates it with fabric she's collected from real life.  The songs I like make this purchase a 5 star choice for me.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Chris Kyle may be the most lethal sniper in U.S. history, but he is not a compeling writer. His story is definitely told, and  it is an intresting look into the role that the military plays in Afganistan.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Bruno is a fun listen.  My wife loves everything on the album and I bought it for the songs I like best.  Grenade, and Just the Way You Are are wonderful passionate songs.  Marry You is sweet and I expected to see people using it in wedding proposals months ago.  The Lazy Song is my anthem.  I long for days like that.  All of his songs on this album are listenable and I haven't skipped over one yet.  I look forward to hearing his future efforts.  His new album is good, but I've only heard one song from it and it didn't grab me like Grenade or Just the Way You Are.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|The best show on television. This is up there with another one of my favorites, \\" House\\"  and a little better than  \\"Greys Anatomy\\". I cant wait to watch every week.  I am a little worried that alot of main characters have gotten killed off, and wonder how they will put together another season. But I am so looking forward to it.
B009XY97VC|5.0|After searching and searching for something like this, I stumbled on SkyWorld. It is a great album. I think this is one of the better epic sort of genres for music. There are several groups that fall into this same category of artists, but I have to say Two Steps From Hell is the best.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Would not load to my Samsung Tablet !!!! Could possibly be fun if it worked. Guess can't expect too much for the price of $.99
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is great.  I like how easy it is to use.  It offers options on the type of clock you want displayed from a 24 hour clock to a standard clock dial (like on a watch).  You can also select music to wake up to and hitting the snooze is very ease to do, even if you are groggy!  There's an option to display the local weather if you so choose.
145551389X|5.0|Great book beautiful photos and a great addition to any GAGA fans collection. Great for coffee tables and conversation starters.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|I had already fallen in love with Javier Bardem in Eat Pray Love, so I initially watched this move primarily because of him.  Turns out that this movie is fun with a capital F and SEXY in all caps.  Great characters and just a lot of fun to watch.  Makes me want to check the Euro exchange rate...
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I think &#34;Les Miserables&#34; will always be one of my favorite movies of all times.  I hope you will enjoy it too.
B00AFEY354|5.0|All of us, at one point in time, were not sure where we stood in school / high school.  This film goes into the hard to discuss issues of teens today and the trials they go through with pressure from the ones that like to bully everyone else.<br /><br />There are a lot of delicate issues that are brought up in this film that kids today have a hard time discussing or coming to terms with.<br /><br />I think this is a great film to watch, to better understand the kinds of pressure kids in school face today.<br /><br />It is very well done.  Worth watching, especially if you have kids in school.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|It was  wonderful to see this again, and the Cars and styles of the early 60&#34;s. Audrey Hepburn is gorgeous!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This film had me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it.  Everything dipicted in this film was so realistic, that there is no way that Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor could have not gotten hurt at some point in making this film.<br /><br />They, plus the kids, were incredible in how they presented this story.<br /><br />I won't give any of it away talking about it, but I will say this film is terrifying to watch, but you also see the most amazing miracle happen before your very eyes.<br /><br />The fact that it is a true story, made me appreciate this film all the more.<br /><br />Unbelievable and so very well done.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should read this book. It will change your outlook on so many things in our world. I recommend reading it.
1607066017|5.0|Not since Marvel's Civil War and DC's Watchmen have I felt this connected to a story. To star crossed lovers in a war torn world have a child while being chased down by almost everyone. A fantastic sci-fi comic that truly deserves a read!
0143122010|5.0|While initially I did have hesitation about buying this enormous and rather dense book, the subject matter and the witty and insightful writing used by Pinker makes this both accessible and interesting.
0470913029|5.0|I will not go into a long story with this book, but in short...it has changed my life. My daughter has both gluten and dairy allergies so I decided Paleo would help me get over not having these things in the house. And not only has it done that, but I have lost almost 20 pounds the first month (I am a big guy) with ZERO working out!  I can't wait to see what I can lose when I do start my work out plan!<br /><br />Please look into this lifestyle. I don't like calling it a diet, because it really isn't. It is an eating lifestyle that can restore your body and health. This is not a fad diet like the Atkins diet (or any other low carb diet), the Beyonce diet, this is something you can bet your health for the rest of your life on. Please read this and give it a shot.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had to force myself to finish this novel, which still has me baffled with all of the publicity this series has received. It did get better towards the end, and i decided to continue on with the additional books. This one was not nearly as good as the two remaining pieces in the trilogy and in the end I'm glad I chose that particular path. I'm looking forward to the release of the feature films.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Really nice game. Very cute &amp; funny animation. Good selection of words from many categories. Only down side is you cant save a game in progress. Serious omission. If you quit a game in progress you lose your score.<br />Other than that no complaints
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I loved it. Every thing he writes is so well written.  Every story has a different twist.  I am on another one of his books.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A good read in plain english.<br />I found  it very enticing  and entertaining. I would love  to read more books of same author
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Bought this book on a whim.  Loved it.  Really gives good insight into the child development aspect.  Glad I read it.
1885167776|1.0|I was going to purchase this book until I looked at the stellar reviews. This is incredible! The book was released on April 1st, but has apparently managed to \\"completely change lives\\" of so many readers before the release date. Most of the reviews were written prior to the release date, 10 of them on March 17. Whoever is in charge of boosting the sales with fake reviews overdid it a bit this time..
B0067R0APK|4.0|Needed something to use when watching storms as we live in a more remote country area. I can follow storm paths and it works well so far.
B008602KQI|1.0|Very barbaric and deeply disturbing.  The sacraficing of children!! Seriously?!!  Children killing children!! What parent, in their right mind, would even allow their children to participate in such a lottery is beyond me!! Or for it to have gone on that long!  And all of sudden after Rue dies, they decide to rebel?  The rebelling should have begun when they made that into law!  I'd rather die fighting the system to protect my children then to allow my children to go through that!!  It's like Lord of the Flies all over again, but with consenting parents! Such is the case in this day and age...wow, just unbelievable!
0060090383|2.0|I have never read Marian Keyes before, and I was very disappointed in this book.  I don't drink and don't do drugs, but I found it rather interesting that this story centered only on that.  I didn't finish it because I got tired of hearing about everyone's problems..nothing positive.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|great game good to kill time with. some of the hidden puzzles arecto dark and hard to see all of the items
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Good one for watching with kids or grandkids! My 10, 11. 13, 17 even like it! Girl and boys! Honestly me too!
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|Love Never Dies assassinated the Characters, maligned and mangled the premise of The Phantom of the Opera. The plot was so unbelieveable, the characters totally abberant in comparison.  Actually there is no comparison.  The original Phantom stage production was amazing in costume, design, content, music and stunning performances.  The characters played their roles with a deep emotional investment.  Love Never Dies was a huge disappointment! Totally forgettable...costumes, set designs, music and, the character assassinations were beyond the pale.  The only stand-out performance was the child.  The characters from the Phantom of Opera should sue Love Never Dies for slander, libel, and defamation of character.  Love was offensive and insulting to the orginial production. Watching Love was a very unpleasant, painful experience. Love may never die, but the viewer might consider expiring a blessing.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I saw it first on the way to Hawaii on plane. And when we back decide to watch it again! 4 stars just because when you watch it on TV thrush Amazon subtitles is not possible unfortunately...<br />This movie also recommend for us by my grandsons - 11 years old and 10.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Wow that was totally worth the wait. If you can ever fit in the time to read the selection and the elite lease do these are great books with romance and passion yet they never leave out thrill read them!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The premise could have come from recent headlines.  A well-written mystery that gives the reader, especially parents, much to reflect about.  A real page turner and extremely interesting.
B00CDTSQZW|3.0|Many, many. many bad viking movies have been made... More than fifty years ago Kirk Douglas and his production company produced what most people still consider the &#34;best&#34; Viking movie ever made, The Vikings.<br /><br />Given what information available at the time, they made a good faith effort to do the thing relatively authentically. And they made a really bad movie. We have learned so much in the fifty years since, especially due to advances in archaeology, and many scholars and reenactors around the world (of whom I am among the least) work hard to authentically depict Viking Age life.<br /><br />Many very accurate replicas of Viking ships have been built, to the wonder of many, have actually sailed these vessels to the distant lands that the vikings explored. Any moderately accurate depiction of the Viking Age would far surpass Kirk Douglas's film in portraying of one of the most exciting and colorful eras in human history.<br /><br />The History Channel's new series, Vikings, is simply not very historically accurate.<br /><br />I could say a lot about the many technical faults of this series -- the ridiculous idea that 8th or 9th Century Scandinavians had no knowledge of the British Isles, the placement of the &#34;steering board&#34; on the wrong side of the ship, the really, really &#34;creative&#34; costuming -- but my biggest disappointment on the basis of viewing the first eight episodes is the blatantly wrong philosophical and political underpinnings of the series. There is clearly a political ideology being flogged here, and it's more significant to our current history than you probably think.<br /><br />The primary villain of the series is the chieftain who rules over our hero Ragnar Lodbrok (Travis Fimmel), a man called Jarl (Earl) Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne). This title formulation, by the way, is a silly one, basically equivalent to calling the modern queen of England &#34;Queen Windsor.&#34; Jarl Haraldson rules like a medieval feudal lord, dominating the governing assembly (the &#34;Thing&#34;), bullying and threatening everyone. Our hero, Ragnar, dreams of sailing West to raid the British Isles, but the Jarl insists there is no such place. He threatens Ragnar with the confiscation of his property if he does not obey, and raid East instead.<br /><br />This is a horribly inaccurate depiction of the political system of the Vikings. Lazy, contemporary, and &#34;progressive&#34; minded scriptwriters are prone to writing stories about some dynamic young person (who wants freedom) in conflict with a hidebound old conservative, who lives by stifling oppression.<br /><br />My major problem with a series coming from a network that calls itself the &#34;History Channel&#34; -- is that this is precisely the opposite of the political dynamic that was actually playing out during the Viking Age. In the Viking Age, there was indeed an old tradition -- but it was a tradition of freedom and democracy. And there were plenty of fresh new ideas about -- but they were ideas of the new elite: centralization and autocracy.<br /><br />Prof. Torgrim Titlestad of the University of Stavanger has written a thesis on Viking society (which had roots in earlier Germanic tribalism of the sort described by Tacitus) was essentially democratic, centered in local, district, and regional Things, with authority vested in twelve-man courts and &#34;Lawspeakers,&#34; whose duty it was to recite one-third of the law each year. These were not egalitarian assemblies -- the local chieftains certainly did have power and they exercised it -- but the vikings were essentially democratic, and every free man had a voice at a Thing.<br /><br />As depicted in the Vikings series, the Thing is held in the Jarl's longhouse and is totally under his, and his creature's, control. The Jarl acts in ways the real Vikings of that time would never have tolerated. One of the old Norwegian Thing laws makes it a civil duty to rebel against a chieftain who is overbearing and selfish. Things were also held in the open air, in a central, neutral location offering no special advantage to the chieftain or any other free man.<br /><br />Now, it is accurate that the Viking Age was an age of change in Scandinavia. The old democratic Thing system came under attack from &#34;progressives&#34; who believed they had a better way to govern. These new thinkers were primarily Christians who had learned these radical new ideas in continental Europe. These new ideas argued that everything would work much better if all the power was placed in the hands of a king, who would centrally manage the realm, Feudalism. The old democratic Things, in this view, were outmoded relics of a barbaric and heathen past, they needed to be stamped out and replaced by a state religion and a more centralized government.<br /><br />The good folks at the History Channel got it so totally wrong. Telling this truth about the vikings would be akin to a 21st Century Hollywood blasphemy.<br /><br />That all being said, the series is still pretty entertaining. They got a whole lot of things right. The production values are very high. The characters are interesting, well developed, and they are well acted. The sets, locations, and lighting are artistic and beautiful to look at. Is the series perfect? No, there are many mistakes, that real scholars of the period will no doubt notice, but rewriting history to pervert an entire society's system of government because of a progressive modern political bent is just dead wrong.ng and selfish.

B008QTVNUI|3.0|I love the story.  The main character is a great actor who was also in the Forsythe Saga, but I hate the nudity and foul language.
1400069807|5.0|Although a bit harsh on the companies that make the foods we eat and love, Michael Moss provides a sharp insight to why the foods we eat are so full of the troika of bad...salt, sugar and fat. But we live them, cannot get enough of them and here is where the dilemma lies. He points a very telling story. The opening chapter about 16 companies meeting to discuss this is akin to a conclave of Mafia families. That is his intent.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This a great show with a fantastic cast.  It is funny and witty with and frequent and great pop culture references!

B00AFYZDL2|4.0|A Saxon classic album witch has its roots at the old saxon way of making metal..very good biff always rocks.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Though there are many reviews on this movie, I had to share mine.  This movie is a must for families to view.  My daughter told me about it, and our Church had it in the library for viewing also.  After awhile, I decided to watch it on cable.  I commend the writing for showing how important it is for father's to realize how important their roles are in their families lives.  Also, showing how a house divided will not stand.  For also showing the importance of father's taking responsibility as leaders in their homes.  For them to also be examples for their children and wives.<br /><br />One lesson I got out of the writing, was to not take anything for granted in life.  Your love ones may be here one day, and gone the next.  No matter how small, enjoy your children while they are here today.  Take time out for them at every chance one can.  Don't let daily struggles, problems, or anything draw one away from their families.  Tell your family that you love them, and talk to each other as a loving family should.  Those special moments are priceless, and never can be gotten back.<br /><br />Though it took a tragedy to change these father's lives forever, the outcome was beyond anyone's dreams.  I felt proud that these father's realized that they could not do it alone without God.  Their faith and trust was put through the test at times, but their persistence to obey Christ's word prevailed.<br /><br />It should make one re-evaluate their lives, and always put Christ first.  Great movie!

B009NLC1D6|5.0|Gandhi was an excellent movie that didn't hold back any punches when looking at the life of Gandhi and the injustice that he fought.  The only drawback is that it is a long movie so be prepared for that.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|I downloaded this and installed it on my Kindle fire HD but I haven't been able to view one video.  I wrote to iMediaShare help and after a few back and forth emails where I detailed the problem (\\"iMedia Share has stopped\\") they wrote me that version 4.53 will take care of that and they are just \\"waiting for approval\\" and I should be notified and be able to download the newer version.  UPDATE: Sometime over the weekend, I noticed I had iMediaShare 4.55  Thank you Amazon, thank you iMediaShare.  I didn't have to do anything, it just \\"appeared\\" and it works just fine!  I love being able to share watching videos on my big screen tv!
B00CBKLO52|3.0|I bought this game thinking that you could use any RC toy but you could only use the ones given to you to use unless you bought them but I do not to pay $3 for another plane. So that's why I give a 3 instead of a 5.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I understand that One Size does NOT fit ALL ... I can just report on how good the fit is for me.  Firefly is a great blend of action and drama and comedy.  I love the technical effects.  To me, it is 100% believable.  This show makes you think about morality and there are great lessons in Leadership, Teamwork and Family presented here. Maybe it is better for The Legend of Firefly that only 1 season was made.... they did not make any episodes that stink.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book is easy to follow, the directions are simply put out so that you understand them straight away,<br /><br />This has taught me even more skill about Word which I didn't know.  Thanks
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you loved Temple Run 1, then you will love this second one! Is it just me or are the graphics on this one so much better? I actually felt I was in the game the first time I played! My heart beat really fast! I must warn you though, it is a little harder than the first one!

B008K6HN8I|4.0|The only thing I would change would be the fact that it is so easy to delete something important through this app, android needs to fix this and be a little more like apple products in this sense, because for a person like me for example, it is so easy to delete an important driver on a PC thinking that it is just garbage.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a special book. The author writes a good story, but most importantly, his use of the language is superior. I laughed out load many times even though the events were dramatic.<br />I looked to see what else Mr Weir has written, and although I don't see anything yet, I'll be sure to get his next book as soon as available.<br />I reccomend this highly.

B00B7Y0206|5.0|I am so glad I was able to find this app to download for the kindle on Amazon! You have no idea how upset I was when I found out that youtube had not made an app for the kindle. I absolutely love it! Of course I will recommend it because out all of the apps available for Youtube Kindle, this is the best one. It also has an option where you can download videos directly from youtube to your kindle. Another thing I really liked about this app was the way in which it organizes your subscriptions! You can easily view and find the channels you most love by looking at the pictures and seeing many of them at the same time! LOVE IT!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 does not disappoint. I am so attached to the characters and storyline that I would like it to continue forever. However, I was told that season 4 will be the last season.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This is essentially a GPS antenna that connects via USB to your computer. It works. You need charting/navigation software to receive and handle the GPS data. The company provides a utility to test the data receiving functions of the Receiver, but charting software must be sourced elsewhere.<br /><br />This device works on both my Windows 7 PC and on my Macs running Snow Leopard.<br /><br />One tip: while the Receiver comes with an installation CD/DVD, the included drivers may not be up to date. Once I downloaded and installed the up to date drivers from the company website it worked immediately. This is a good product.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I absolutely love the show. Leaves me on the edge of my seat wanting to see more.<br />I love the action in it. Every time you think you have it figured out it has another curve.<br />I would recommend it to everyone.
B00B69UQJY|1.0|I put Violator in my top five albums ever but this album sounds amateur at best. If it was created by anyone without a history it probably wouldn't even make it to production. I had high hopes for DM as always but this album is just lazy.

B0037471TE|3.0|I have seen the 3 movies first and this is another case of the movie deviating from a great book.<br />While reading the book I was continually amazed that the story line was not followed for the movie.<br />I thought the storyline in the movie was good but the book is infinitely better and I wonder how the movie makers were allowed to change the story so much.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|As a reader who likes psychological thrillers, this was one of the better books of that genre that I have read in a long time.  Camille Preaker is a reporter for a Chicago newspaper who has been assigned to cover the murder of two girls in her hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri.  Once she gets home, old feelings come back to haunt her from her childhood.  This is compounded by the fact that her younger sister was murdered in the same manner as the two girls.<br /><br />While this would sound like a run-of-the-mill murder mystery, this story is really about Camille, her sister Amma and their mother Amora.  The mother never seemed to recover from the grief of losing a daughter and both of the girls have suffered in other ways.  Some of Camille's recollections are downright disturbing, such as losing her virginity at 13 to not one but four boys (\\"I got more action that night than I have the last ten years\\"), and her cutting.  The cutting she did spelled out words across her entire body, save for a \\"crop circle\\" on her back.  Amma, currently 13, is also acting out in manners that are signs of troubled teenagers.<br /><br />The murder investigation, and stories for Camille's paper, are still progressing through the story and the former takes many twists and turns, while the latter becomes an afterthought as Camille goes through many emotions as memories and interactions with her mother become entangled.  One interesting aspect of the murder investigation is that the lead detective Richard and Camille sleep together.  Not necessarily for the sex, but because one person has information the other wants for their work.<br /><br />The reader really gets into why Camille is so tortured and while painful to read at times, are well-written and draw the reader into her soul.  A great read that I gave 4 ½ stars.  My only reason for slightly less than 5 was the overly disturbing aspects of Camille's and Amma's life that shook me.<br /><br />Did I skim? No<br /><br />Did I feel connected to the characters?  No, but that is good.  These characters' flaws, especially those in Camille and Amma, were portrayed with such vivid detail that not many readers could really \\"relate\\" even if they shared some of those characteristic in their personal lives.<br /><br />Pace of the story:  I felt it was a bit slow.

0307352153|4.0|\\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\" is a book that has been sitting in my to-do list for a few months now. I'd heard about the hype surrounding the book and its premise - to challenge the misconceptions of what it means to be an introvert. As an introvert myself, I decided it was time to discover if this was another self-inflated attempt at psychology-made-easy, or if \\"Quiet\\" really was a new window into the world of the introverted self.<br /><br />At first glance, the prose is unassuming and easy to read. The author touches on the reality of today: our world is designed for the extrovert - from the group desks and mandatory group work in our schools to the open plan offices in our workplaces and the focus on presentation skills and forceful conversation. The author illuminates the bitter reality - that introversion, by and large, has been considered an unwanted trait: a concern of the parents of shy children, a personal development issue for the manager of an employee who enjoys working alone, a constant worry of an individual who would rather read a book than attend a dinner party.<br /><br />Through careful exposition, the author sources a number of thought-provoking studies that reveal the hidden power of introverts. These include: creativity (70% of all creative are introverts), persistence, concentration, insight, sensitivity and the ability to solve complex problems. There are many areas in which introverts excel in comparison to their extroverted brethren and these are only a few of the numerous insights within \\"Quiet\\".<br /><br />The author's research is excellent. She sources from a number of studies and findings, conveying the material in a manner that is both revealing and easy to digest. Reinforcing the work are the various stories from interviewees, introverts themselves who have grown up in a world (mostly) designed for extroverts. The stories break the monotony of the text, making the reading of \\"Quiet\\" an enjoyable experience rather than a taxing one. I was truly surprised by the depth of the author's research - indeed, the final 30% of the book is dedicated to the reference table and many scientific studies which the author makes use of.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" is a satisfying and meaningful presentation of the benefits of the introverted self. If you, a partner or a member of your family is an introvert, I would highly recommend this book as a means of exploring the introverted self and the power that lies within.

I was truly surprised by the depth of the author's research - indeed, the final 30% of the book is dedicated to the reference table and many scientific studies which the author makes use of.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" is a satisfying and meaningful presentation of the benefits of the introverted self.

B007REV4YI|5.0|This has to be the best 007 movie (of the Daniel Craig series) yet!!! Worth every (Money) Penny!!! A must have for your dvd or blu ray collection if you like action movies and stuff similar to 007.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|This is music at it's zenith. Layne Staley haunts you with his unique voice while Mark Lanegan makes a great replacement on unreleased songs. The live footage shows how Mike McCready is the leading guitarist of the last 20 years. Mad Season had a very short life time & maybe you wished for more but i dont mind that there was only Above.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Love musicals and this rates really high on my  list.. Would recommend  it to anybody that like musicals.<br />with a little history thrown in.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|More excellent stories with brilliant acting, ingenious plots, fantastic special effects,  magical music and wonderful humour. An enchanting series with a new villain to assist Morgana in her relentless persuit of the throne of Camelot. Most enjoyable!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book has been an inspiration to me!! I loved the way Cheryl writes with such clarity and easy to read style.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I remember about 6 or 8 years ago that I saw this game available for the Nintendo DS and I thought it looked cute but too expensive (like $35 or $40) so I never bothered with it.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise that this game costs $1 and then you pay another $1 for the rest of the game! $2 for a game that use to cost $40? Wow!! Total score!!<br /><br />I have a lot of fun with the different scenarios and being a different character (you pay $1 for each theme of characters). Thanks for doing a good job and bringing this game. It looks so awesome on my Note 2!!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is our almost two year old granddaughters favorite dvd. We actually had a video and she wore it out that is why we bought the dvd. She loves it
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I got this lovely app as FAOTD several months ago. It's so vividly stunning and soothing for me to play this puzzle game. I can't really say much except I love the orbs of colors as they expand and contract making me think and feel like I'm on an intergalactic journey. Groovy!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this game is great but it wont let me play other waves shin I only can move forward and this is makeing it hard to pass waves please fix this problem other than that this game is great
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I like the game.  It was a free game.  However, as you play it, you're only allowed to play a few games before you're expected to pay for golden bars.  Once you turn it off, and start again later, you go through the same process again.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I wished I knew more about the game before I bought the game. It does not tell you how to play the game. There should be more info on  how to play the game
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Beautiful songs, beautiful voice and great performances!  This is a must to all music lovers!  I highly recommend this to all those who appreciate great talent!
B005LW5J9O|5.0|It is beautifully written. A history through little-known times, from the Greeks to Jefferson,  laying a fascinating trail of  Humanistic thinking.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|This is one of the all time great music groups!  The music was amazing and the songs just kept coming!  Very entertaining and it did not disappoint!  I would recommend this music dvd to anyone who loves music!  This is one of the all time great music dvds!  It is a MUST for anyone who loves great music!
B00CAJDUX8|5.0|I know that this album is probably the most disliked due to the issues with copying songs but I think that this is a God pop album that could be good for the spring and summer. Highlights are Scream and Shout, #thatpower, Geekin', and also Fall Down, the duet with Miley Cyrus.
B00BA5H3TU|5.0|A wonderful blend of progressive rock with dynamic flair.  Pink Floyd meets Jethro Tull's Aqualung.  It's hard to imagine Riverside outdoing Anno Domini: High Definition, but it happened.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great free app, love all the different sounds you can mix. I also like the timer feature, I use it when I go to bed
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|Wayyy too much hardcore sexual talk and cursing. But funny in parts. If you like vulgar disfuntional famlies and previously mentioned stuff...you may like it.
B00BUL0IHI|3.0|I am huge fan of weezy, followed him from day one. Not a fan of this new album; however, theres three songs he kills it on. I dont blame the guy cause hes done so much. I aint hating Weeze and I'll keep buying.
B00B5AIB14|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of the regular \\"Kaya\\" album, which is some of the more superb music Bob Marley ever made, so I will use this review to touch upon the differences of this deluxe edition and the original \\"Kaya\\" CD. First off, the first disc is simply the remastered \\"Kaya\\" CD. The sound is very crisp. I have the original CD (non-remastered), and I can say the bass on this CD has a better sound. It's more pronounced and harder, more like the vinyl version.<br /><br />The second disc contains the live concert at Ahoy Hallen (Rotterdam, Netherlands) on July 7, 1978. The perfection that Bob demanded of his band during live performances comes through loud and clear in this concert. Bob and the Wailers sound very tight in every song. I had not previously heard this performance, so this disc has been a real treat for me. The version of \\"Easy Skanking\\" in the concert is easily the best one I've heard up to this point. There are several great live performances of \\"Exodus,\\" but the one during this concert is incredible. Every single song is performed with near-perfection. You can tell that Bob and his band have really hit their stride at this point in their career.<br /><br />The only nitpick I have with this package is that there is no clear plastic slipcase around the cardboard CD case. All of Bob Marley's previous deluxe editions have come with this slipcase. Again, that is perhaps being nitpicky, but it would have been nice to have the slipcase to better protect the cardboard case.<br /><br />All in all, the deluxe edition of \\"Kaya\\" is a fine product. The concert disc alone is worth the money. The remastered original album is awesome for someone like me who is upgrading from the original CD release. I am looking forward to the release of the remaining deluxe editions of Bob Marley's albums, especially \\"Survival.\\" Whoever has been doing the Bob Marley deluxe editions is doing a bang-up job.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My son loves sharks and loves this game.  He's even saving his coins to upgrade within the game which is not like him.  It's probably a tad too violent seeing as the shark can eat people, but my son doesn't do well with blood (even fake) so it's not too bad.  Definitely don't see it as educational in any way, just for entertainment.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was amazing and I really wanted her to end up with Gale but Peeta is rebirth Gale is destruction and he didn't care if innocent children died and Prim dying killed me but the saddest part was me finishing the book series I am now depressed and I really hope Suzanne writes another one with Peeta and Katniss' children in it
B008K9UZY4|4.0|I think this game is fun and pretty simple to use.  The person I downloaded it for, my 7 year old, does NOT like it.  Not to say that anything is wrong with the app just that it's too fast for him.  I've had no problems with loading or any glitches to date.  Overall the game is fine and I enjoy playing it.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|Even with the English subtitles, this movie lends itself to the heartwarming drama of a true story between social classes.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|While I find the whole a bit of a fantasy read because of the &#60;spoiler&#62;fairy tale ending&#60;/spoiler&#62;, there is definitely some truth to the ideas being portrayed in the book.  For many organizations, even non-high-tech, a fluid corporate IT environment can make or break long term success.  That doesn't discount sales, marketing, etc., but it's one of the areas usually disparaged as a &#34;cost center&#34; that doesn't give it the credit/resources necessary. This is a good read for director level or above of all parts of an organization, but view it as a modern fable.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is super cool triing to unlock the next level to explore it it is awesome. love this game it rocks
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I really like what J.J. Abrams has done with this movie. The casting of the younger characters is excellent, and the storyline is action packed! I can't wait to see the new one entitled &#34;Into Darkness&#34; which comes out in May. Also, I may be living in the past, but I am quite happy to buy DVDs for such low prices. This one was ridiculously low . . . around $3.50!
B002FGU44O|5.0|I love these sandals! I first discovered Teva a few years ago. Now I'm a fan! Durable, comfortable, gives you occasional blisters, no just kidding. Buy them, wear them! They're good!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Liked the movie and was impressed that the subject had a conscience!<br />That is a rarity today!  Denzil was his usually good actor self.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run to is better than the original. it is new and improved and is so fun and interesting it keeps you busy when your bored
B009MYAQK4|5.0|It seems that one of Paulo Coelhe's books come to me in the order I need them. As always this one arrived right on time. Thank you Namaste'
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I have always like Danny Devito! I see actors have expanded their careers by doing voices for animated movies, wonderful. Plus it addresses the problem of our tree lost and how it impacts us.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really liked it because it kept me wanting to know what happens next.  A real psychological thriller, different than any other book I've read in this genre.
B009OA57MI|5.0|I highly recommend this app. it is fun and can be challenging. graphics are great.  I can't believe it's so inexpensive.
0375851569|3.0|There are 2 good books in this collection:  Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham.  The others (One Fish Two Fish, Fox in Socks, Hop on Pop) are just plain annoying to read.  They are basically fool of tongue twisters that make little sense and are hard for kids (or adults, for that matter) to make sense of.  My 3 year old got bored of them very fast but always asks for the other two books.
0061733199|5.0|Portable,inexpensive,complete,delivered to your door.  A must have for any serious preppers. You will undoubtedly learn a few things that are interesting and useful
0812469496|2.0|This is a really simple, somewhat sappy story with (IMHO) bad illustrations.  The illustrations are very literal and clearly was illustrated in the 80's (from the decor, the clothing, the cassette tapes pictured).... which in itself is not a bad thing, but the book just doesn't have that creative, timeless element I've come to expect from good children's books (think, Dr. Seuss, Where the Wild Things Are, Harold and his purple crayon, etc.)<br /><br />A friend later told me that the book was featured in a &#34;Friends&#34; episode, which helps explain why its sales are so high even though it's really a pretty mediocre book.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love the movie but the music really makes it wonderful to me. I especially love the morning piano piece. I like that the soundtrack started out with this piece instead of near the end like in the movie. My only regret is that each piece is short. This is because it is short in the movie I just wish that a few of them were longer. I like to drive with this music on. It is soothing.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Love books like this.  Fantasy, action and even some thrills.  Great for light summer time reading.  And it's a series, who could ask for more.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A deliciously clever read that teaches you just how little you know a person. My favourite book of 2012. I cant wait for what she does next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really cool graphics. I love all the realistic looking horses. Helps teach responsibility. Great for kids and adults to play.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|The numbers displayed on the screen are much too small and difficult to read. I play on my Samsung phone and 7\\" tablet. It's a shame because the font could have been a bit larger without affecting the game design at all. Especially irritating at the end of each game, when scoring. The small numbers don't appear in a consistent position, so they are easy to miss.<br /><br />Perfect in every other way.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This has to be, by far, the very best book for anyone beginning in photography. Great explanation of how things work and good images to illustrate the points.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My Dad wanted it! He'll tell me to get my thing-a-ma-jig and play this for an hour! Get it if you like angry birds!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game because I get to have my own<br />littlest petshop and it is a fun game to play.
B00280LYHS|5.0|The Percy Jackson series is the only series that is great everytime I read it again. I wish there was just one more book
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I  love  this  games  because it get run my own restaurant a nd I love cooking the food for my  customers.
B000FA675C|5.0|Loved the story, loved the history, loved the writing.  Had read it years ago, then saw the movie and wanted to read it again.  Its great how well the movie stayed with the book.  Interesting characters, good descriptive, great history..point made.  Well worth the time you'll spend reading it.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Good script and great acting. It sets up the franchise very well. I can watch it more than once with my kids and rest of the family.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I . Enjoy playing this game when I have a little spare time which is not<br />very often. I love it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is another film right up there with Schindler's list.  It shows the horrible tragedy of the holocaust but with one man's way of helping his young son cope as well as himself with the drastic changes to their lives.  It's remains fairly light hearted but with out removing the seriousness of the holocaust but rather shows the bravery and optimism with which some faced their situation.  A must see.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|A continuation of the Fast and Furious series, this one doesn't disappoint if you like the first and fourth film.  It stays in line more with those two the 2 & 3 which were just not that great.  A return of Vin Diesel and the action packed sequences you would expect.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|If you are taking Microbiology or just like cool movies this one is for you.  Good example of how disease spreads and how quickly it can.  Even if you don't understand the mechanism and just want to watch an interesting suspense film you'll enjoy this one.
6305077630|4.0|Here is a flash back to life growing up in the 80's with a novel twist, you are in the fantasy of every teenage boy's.  Having the ideal girl, fast cars and nice clothes and the envy of all your classmates.  Being popular was the end all be all at that age, but this movies helps you see there is more to it and brings on the just be yourself motif.  Funny and entertaining.
B003FIUTA0|5.0|This is a story I believe everyone should know and take to heart.  The struggle so many people of undertaken to bring equality, didn't originate in the US as many believe but around the world.  There are many that did not hold the right of slavery but believed that God created all men equal.  Men are not men because of color or ethnicity but because God created them and that means all.  God did not distinguish because of color or gender and we should do likewise, treat all men and women as equal because they are.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|This was a pretty good remake of a classic movie with much better special affects.  The story lacks a little but with good action who really cares right.  I enjoyed for the 5 bucks it cost.
B005LAII3A|5.0|This version of the film is by far my favorite over the original.  The story has been altered but the intrigue and fast pace is awesome, as well as the special effects, the addition of two gorgeous costars and visually stunning.  Good sci-fi flick.
630542845X|5.0|Really cool story that explores prejudice but with a powerful twist, kind of X-men meets outsider thing.  Thou it doesn't line up with my personal beliefs I do believe the story is still a good one and inspiration in it's own way.  Moving for sure.
078322687X|4.0|Great movie to re-identify with your younger self if you grew up in the 80's or 90's, even still relevant to kids today though the technology is more advanced the social pressures of growing up are always timeless.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|interesting interpretation of some classic fairy tales, the movie did fair in the theater but at such an inexpensive price it was hard to resist.  Worth watching for action and cool visual effects.
B008BUK0XI|4.0|Classic Tom Cruise of course, this helps round out the series and bring the fun back into it after MI:3 took it to a serious place.  The action and intrigue are back with the fun atmosphere reminiscent of the first two films.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This was another good movie in the X-Men series.  My wife and I enjoy the series very much and hope they continue to produce more films.  Rumor has it they are creating a film to reconcile all of the previously made films so far with a time line fix.  Looking forward to it.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|this is a pretty good movie, I enjoy the franchise so getting this for me simply complete my collection but this one is not as good as the first four (if you include Rise of the Lycans); however, it is still action packed and entertaining in it's own right.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|This one is an interesting twist on the Sci-Fi's I own, but I like it, it's space hero meets Vikings and becomes local villagers hero.  I always liked Jim Caviezel and the character's he usually plays so maybe I'm just biased.
B002AT4KA0|4.0|the movie is very fast paced, if you like cars and speed and chase scenes then you'll enjoy this movie.
B007X4ECMI|3.0|This is no Star Wars or Star Trek but if you've been starving for an average Sci-fi this will tide you over.  It has descent action and the special effects are alright.  It's isn't my favorite but for 5 o 6 bucks it was worth it for a few hours of entertainment.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Classic girl meets boy movie, romantic comedy with John Cusack and the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale.  She is a bit crazy in what she believes and comes to regret a decision but it all turns out good in the end.  My wife and I Love it
B00004WEJZ|5.0|In my opinion the best Bond movie Sean Connery was in.  I don't know why they don't include this in the cannon of Bond movies but it should be really.  It doesn't have the classic bond music but that's all it lacks, it's action packed, some interesting gadgets and gorgeous woman of course.  Two thumbs up for me and a had to have for my collection.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|I didn't want to watch this movie until I was 'ready' and by that I mean in the correct frame of mind to delve deep. I looked forward to savoring Phillip Seymour Hoffman as well as Mr. Phoenix, two great American actors and anti-heroes who in the context of this story line almost seem to have been cast for their sexual chemistry with one another as much as what they bring to their individual roles.<br /><br />while this is a beautiful complex and well thought out film its downfall is it's a little boring. I say that as someone who's got the attention span of a thinking movie buff. I find there's a certain style of filmmaking that strives desperately to transcend its medium in order to become high art and in the process overcompensates or loses track of the audience as well as the reality of filmmaking, which is ultimately about entertainment. these sort of tense method acting exchanges set against classic Americana themes just sort of loop around themselves slooowly to the point where personally I just began to lose interest. I actually think the film would have a lot more movement and depth had the director relied more on developing fundamental ideas at the core of Scientology than the charisma of the characters. one is a misfit alcoholic with a temper and the other is a brilliant salesman new agey hack. now what? it's pretty cut and dry to the point where mining his stars' acting chops scene after scene becomes tedious. disappointed.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book makes me happy on the inside.  If ever there was a story that encapsulated the power of allegory, this is it.  I can't recommend it enough to anyone who's in need of a little inspiration.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this a very thought provoking book. It is filled with hope for the human race. I felt most of the technical language was explained well. I really enjoyed the family connections and the love that was shared. It makes one feel at ease about dying. I have always believed in an afterlife but this confirms it. A good read.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I've been a huge Beach Boys fan from day one, and this album does not disappoint!  Even though we all know that not all of the original band members are there, the sound is just as good as ever; they haven't lost their youthful sound.  I enjoy all of the songs, mellow and pleasingly harmonious.  I'm almost embarrassed to say that I listen to this CD almost every night as I'm falling asleep, or in the middle of the night if I wake up and can't go right back to sleep.  It's very relaxing as well as beautiful.
B005COO1X6|3.0|The story line was ok.  I was excited to read another Stephen King book however I felt as though the story was not fully developed.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|It was funny. Characters were described to details, especially some of them, like Miss Bates. I would recommend for reading and enjoyment.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Best book on photography.author explained basics of correct exposure in simple langue which is easy to follow.book must for<br />Amture photographer.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|I swear every Easter this movie will be played in millions of homes. Its that much of a classic movie.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This is the story of a young boy who searches for the answers we all crave to find. Is God real? Why so many different kinds of religions? is God there to protect us and guide us and provide for us?<br />This young man finds his answers through a journey unparalleled for most people. His excceptance of God and his willingness to roll with the punches  as well as his desire to see and feel God make this movie a life time classic to remember and learn from.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|The music, acting, backgrounds and complete display of  that period of time was so well scripted and moving that tears just flowed down my cheeks. I felt like not only could i understand but i could have at one time in a previous life have lived it.  It was that moving!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The story told at any time from any perspective is beyond amazing! The actors chosen to play the parts, the computer digital input and the music....all together create one of the most fantastic movies that will always be an original and many will return to watch over and over again.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|We had a lively discussion about this book in my book group and one of our members was a foster mom. It was very enlightening.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This is really a 4 player game (same device) but there is a cpu to fill in if your playing solo. The point is to not be killed by having your ice flow blocked off where a shark gets you all the while collecting fish. When all penguins are dead the fish are counted and whoever has the most fish wins. There are no levels, just random made levels each time. You can change the size of the play board.<br /><br />The game has internal achievements to gain. I also found the graphics to be cute and fits well for the game. The music is pretty basic but passable. I can see myself turning it off if I played it a lot. It also has no permissions which is a huge bonus.
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|This product is amazing! Such high quality! The &#34;comics&#34; artwork is great, the bluray sound amazing, the whole booklet is a piece of art. Highly recommended!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought two of them for my daughters who are avid fans of The Doctor.<br />Highly recommend this as a gift, all Doctor Who fans should have one!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|The music is relaxing and the sound effects are fun. I would like them to expand the music a bit instead of the constant loop of the sound bite.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Great!  I like being able to just flip on my Kindle and have weather right at my fingertips, either for here or wherever my family is.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|The mighty Adele and her little concert in the heart of London town, at the Royal Albert Hall no less. That lofty venue is often filled by pomp and ceremony and with Adele, you get none of that....just her amazing voice. A voice that touches and flourishes in whatever part of the world you are listening in.<br /><br />A lot has already been said about her ability to convey so much through her music and its all true, so I will focus this review on why I think you should run, not walk to buy this DVD.<br /><br />1. Her music. Her voice. Her interpretations of her songs and classic covers.<br /><br />2. Her banter. I know many have said that she swears a bit, but I'm a Brit, and that is how most of us communicate. She isn't trying to sell your a version of herself, she is just being herself and I love her for it. You get a real view of a young woman from London and this DVD captures her awe of playing in such a venerable establishment. Whilst most artists would put on airs and graces in such surroundings, the fact that she doesn't says a sh*tload about her. She shares the stories of what she was going through when writing her songs and that insight makes the experience better for it. If you love the artist, love what she represents cos that gives her the ability to write songs that come straight from her heart and touches that part in all of us that can relate. I do wish that my American friends would get off their moral high horses about swearing.....its daily life in the world that I and Adele come from. If you want to pretend that you live in such a perfect cookie cutter world that has nothing to do with being the BIGGEST affecting problem facing your southern neighbours and their drug wars...that you have not got involved in wars with no relevance to you (except you need something from those countries), then by all means remain in a state of blissful 50's innocence when swearing is the biggest crime imaginable.<br /><br />3. The audience. No screaming fans just cos they love her and she is the zeitgeist of the moment but because we adore everything her voice does for us. Some touching audience shots show how her music bring couples, friends and maybe even strangers closer together. I love the shot of loving couples clinging to each other and singing her words to each other. It means something more to them than just a song. The bits when the audience sing Someone like you back to Adele is heartwarming and uplighting and clearly touches a tearful Adele.<br /><br />4. The simple staging. How many other superstars can get away with so little on stage and yet impact on us more that those artists who have to fill their shows with a complete circus act to create the spectacle.<br /><br />5. The film. I have the UK version and I am not at all sure what you get in the US but I found the cinematography perfect, so I wholeheartedly disagree with complains on the quality. Its a brilliant conceived, simple execution. You get Adele, end of.<br /><br />6. Her laugh - its frigging infectious and uplifting.<br /><br />Buy it if you want to experience a global talent with her feet securely rooted in reality, but whose voice transcends gravity.they love her and she is the zeitgeist of the moment but because we adore everything her voice does for us.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|My 6 yr old son loves this game so much so I let him play for an hour every day. After every game he always excitedly updates me on what happened.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|The beginning to an amazing series.  Scalzi has an amazing ability to draw you in and not let you go.
B00BU2SIW4|3.0|I love DM, and this was a good addition, though it doesn't top my favorites. (Ultra, Black Celebration, Some Great Reward.)
B002ROKQJM|1.0|The main character just waffled on & on ... only read through a quarter of the story (if that's what you call it!!) - certainly not my cup of tea.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|The item showed perfectly on time and it was like buying it from the store, thank you. You make my shopping easier
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read book 3.  I really enjoyed book 1 also.  This kept my attention from cover to cover!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This has more swagg than my momma does. Read it people. Preach it people. Preach it again and again. Tell yo grandchildren and your childrens grandchildren. Sing about it in the shower. Now everyone can hear. This is a revolution people....join the party ! #wewereboredinclass (we actually read it though and its really good sooooo...........)  :]
B0091REZMW|5.0|amazing I love it its always something new its more to do in each room and the side games are great too
0811879542|5.0|This book keeps the child involved in its cause and effect motives  Anticipation about what happens on the next page makes the book exciting and interesting.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I recieved this from Goodreads through a giveaway! I was beyond excited when I received the email I got it.  I loved this book even more then the first! We are down to the top 6 girls, though I don't see why. America is the obvious choice. HELLO!<br /><br />The love triangle is still going but I feel like Aspen is starting to become like Gale. Someone that just is messing with our main characters head.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing America grow more in this book and seeing her starting to listen to her heart and what she wants. I hate how she has so many insecurities, but the is what makes her more human and believable. She starts seeing the girls around her as they truly are and realizes that she will lose what she holds dear to one of them if she doesn't stop running away.<br /><br />The rebels add even more drama and tension to the plot. They are continuing their search and more people are getting hurt by them. The King and Maxon are trying to figure out what to do and how to keep the people safe.<br /><br /> Oh Maxon in this book, shows how wonderful of a person he is, and whether America wants to see it or not, it's her influence that is helping him become a better man then his father and he will be a better ruler in the end for it.<br /><br />I almost died when I the the words \\"This is the end of the second book.\\"<br />I was devastated that it came to an end far before I was ready. I wanted things to work out already! And now I have to wait A YEAR to read the next one.  I think I am going to cry in a corner.
0062082353|5.0|very interesting read. really paints a picture of what is was like over there. also gives insight ibto his presonal life
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I can play this game for hours on end!  The fact that its free makes it all that much better!!
B001N4Q4MA|4.0|The animation is very good. A lot of thought was put into the story and how to present it on screen, which is clear to see, I think, and they should be proud of the job they did.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  I could not put the thing down.  Its an easy read and makes you feel like you are there, part of the action!
B00A11AN6O|3.0|the new cloud drive is very nice, however, I would like to be able to delete from  Cloud drive and it sync to my device.  It would also be nice to share photos directly the way photobucket and other services do it.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I use this to keep track of almost everything from my medications to my shopping lists and class schedules. It is very easy to use!
086571701X|2.0|It's not a bad book, but I do agree with many of the negative reviews.  For being at the top of Amazon's search for &#34;aquaponics&#34;, there are better books to purchase such as &#34;the complete idiot's guide to aquaponic gardening.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Have to read it again. Each character is explored with such uniqueness and clarity. Each story is compelling. And it even has a satisfying ending. I was prepare to like it even if it didn't. Just a nice bonus.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I still can't read more than a few chapters at a time without wanting to stop and ponder existence...  Good job, my fave of the vlogbrothers, good job.
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|for a man who loves all the oldies Gary Cooper was a great actor. even saved some space on the old DVR. LOL
B006MOW98E|3.0|Cute, fun; I really liked this book, but some of it wasn't all that mind- blowing.  Good read, though! Yeay!
B001CWOCUO|5.0|Rihanna's talent is pure, natural, and confident in her performances. Her style is raw with pride and accomplishment in her portrayal of her music. Her performance is excellent with all the qualities of great music personalities.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun game. Challenging at first but a really good time waster. The only problem is the people can be  EXPENSIVE!!!  However, you have to buy it.
034580404X|1.0|Cannot figure out how this became such a best seller...the author writes with the equivalent literacy of a high-school drop-out , constantly repeating and scattering thoughts like a neurotic housewife. Really tried to get through the series - it was a chore.<br /><br />Now i need to waste time coming up with 20 more words in order to get this review published...that's a chore also...
B002APU580|5.0|I was worried about not liking this film or that it would be boring, but it wasn't at all. This was a lovely film, great storyline and very intriguing.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Who doesn't like to play Mahjong.  It is fun and keeps the old mind sharp!  I really enjoy a quick game!
B009AMANH4|5.0|This film is great. The process behind the passage of the thirteenth amendment, with all of its deal-making, subtle and not so subtle, is a reminder that not everyone has the same vision of what is right. The acting was better than first rate.
B001Q94TQA|5.0|I was so surprised and pleased to see that this finally came out on Blu-ray! I have to confess, though, that I was skeptical about whether or not it would actually turn out to be \\"Region-Free\\" (see my review of the theoretically all-region BD of \\"Clone\\")... especially since the \\"Product Details\\" section of Amazon's ad states that it is \\"Region B/2\\".<br /><br />For myself, it wouldn't matter, since (thanks to the \\"Clone\\" fiasco) I now have an all-region-modified Oppo BDP-103 player (best BD player on the planet, by the way)... but for the sake of others who need this disc to truly be an all-region one, I'm happy to announce that it is. Incidentally... sharp-eyed consumers will notice that rather than displaying the \\"A-B-C\\" region-code symbol on the back of the case, there is no region-code symbol at all. Just to make sure... I switched my Oppo to each of the three individual Blu-ray regions, and this disc played perfectly on each one.<br /><br />The only caveat I have about the disc is that on the back of the disc's case, it states that the feature's audio output is Dolby Digital 5.1 / DTS Surround / DTS-HD Master Audio... which was an unexpected but very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Not true.<br /><br />The original Standard-Def DVD release of this film was done in 2.1 Dolby Surround... and, not surprisingly, so is this Blu-ray.<br /><br />Nonetheless... this remains as one of my all-time favorite films, and to have it in beautiful high-definition is absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Glad I bought this. I was a huge fan and enjoy watching the series over again to look for holes in the plot.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Overall, this is an interesting little game that can fill up the 5-10 minute breaks you have here and there in your life that is a mix of the classic arcade games Space Invaders and Galaga.  The graphics are fairly low tech, but that's ok as this game is not one of those you will be spending a tremendous amount of time on where every detail has to be perfect.  This is a fairly easy game to play.<br /><br />I picked this up for free during a free app of the day promotion and, as I type this review it has reverted to $1.28 in the Amazon App store.  If you're looking for something besides Angry Birds to work in a pinch, and enjoyed classic arcade games such as Space Invaders or Galaga, I would recommend this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app! Easy to read and easy to use. Great for calculating tips. I like that the numbers are bigger than a typical calculator.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I had a very hard time trying to get this game to download, and it honestly NEVER did!!!  I couldn't get it to finish installing and I seriously just wanted it for my grandson to play.  He never got the chance.  I guess we will just have to pick another game instead.
0812550706|5.0|Hooked from the start, I finished the book in a day, and highly recommended it to others. There's a movie coming out in November of this year (2014) and I'd suggest reading the book before seeing the movie.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Good movie for kids and adults! My four year old got a bit spooked of the boogy man, but overall loved it and watched it several times!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun and easy to play.<br />Three ways to play nice color and sound(you can turn sound & music on or off)<br />I would recomented this game.<br />Thanks Amazon Vern
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Ending was a bit abrupt, but overall a good show. Fast moving and I liked the way it tied into the originals.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I initially bought this just for fun for my own kids. They loved it so much that I use it for some of my kids I tutor. I know you are thinking, &#34;how educational is Zombie Dice!!!??&#34; BUT!! What I do is use the dice as a reward for answering a question. Each student (usually a group of 4 or less) gets asked a question (it depends on the subject what the question might be.) If they get it right, they get to roll. I usually give them hints or something so they don't lose their turn entirely. The first person to reach 13 BRAIIIIINS! is the winner.<br /><br />FOR YOUNGER KIDS (or just to make it eaiser): I made my own little score sheet (I posted an image above in the product photos):<br /><br />It is simply a paper that has the rules and 13 squares. On their turn, the student gets the dice (after their question of course!) They roll. If they have 3 &#34;shotguns&#34; or more...their turn is over. If they have less than that they get to choose to keep rolling or count the brains they have rolled so far. They separate out the shotguns so they can keep track of how close to &#34;3&#34; they are. When they wish to stop (before reaching the limit of 3 shotguns) they cross out that many brains on their scoresheet. Play continues until one player passes the 13 mark. We don't really get into the red, yellow and green colors with most younger students. With older kids, we talk about the sides of the red dice versus the other colors and how the probability is more difficult when you are rolling mostly red dice (versus rolling mostly greens.) Edit: I should have noted that I changed the word &#34;shotgun&#34; to &#34;strike&#34; when I use this at school. &#34;Three strikes you're out&#34; is actually easier for them to remember anyway.<br /><br />It is really a motivating game...I am not even sure why. I almost thought that it might be scary or something for kids, but it is not. They ALL request to play it. Even special needs kids who I assume know what zombies are from television commercials or somewhere. At the end of the school term, I always let them choose one of their favorite games to replay again. The top 3 all-time requests are:<br />1. [[ASIN:B00005JG3Y Pass the Pigs]]<br />2. Zombie Dice<br />3. [[ASIN:B003BMGU2G Yahtzee Super Mario]] (which I also modified, I have a photo there, too.)ere.

B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Have loved all of these movies. Original plot' and I love rooting for Milla Jovavich. Alice is a great main character.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The little bits of information actually provided in this book was excellent and profound. The problem for me is that the vast majority of the book was examples or stories of people's habits. I would have liked more analysis of what is going on and how it can be changed.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|Shipped sooooo fast and is an amazing album. I love it! I'm so proud of Bring Me The Horizon, they've come so far c':
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Excellent remake of an old movie.  The songs are funny and the cast amazing.  Glad to not have the &#34;new&#34; alternative ending.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Is a good story line but Ana is so tiring in her constant whining about \\"not being enough for you\\"  and \\"can't be what you need\\". Makes me want to reach inside the book and strangle her.
B00197U0DU|2.0|I would hope everyone considering the purchase of this album has picked up, at the very least, every other Genesis album with Peter Gabriel on it.  From Genesis to Revelation certainly isn't worthless - there are a few really good tunes here (\\"In the Wilderness\\", \\"Where the Sour Turns to Sweet\\", \\"One Day\\"), though the majority are mediocre.  Peter Gabriel is really the only distinctive band member at this point - the instrumental playing is fine, but fairly anonymous.  The lush arrangements really bug some people, and they're pretty superfluous, but not offensive.  Genesis and Peter Gabriel completists will want to pick this up.  Everyone else is probably better off listening to the Genesis and Gabriel music that's actually good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed season 3 with all of the twists and turns.  Am intrigued with what will happen in season 4.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Working in a local restaurant that doesn't quite provide all of the tools we need (I bring my own set of knives to work, the ones we are given are dollar store worthy), I needed a sharpener I could keep with me that didn't take up too much space.  This little guy feels a little cheap in the hands when you first get it, but it works as well as the $50 non-portable one on my workbench in the garage - I wish I'd found this earlier, it's a great deal.<br /><br />A perfect gift for anyone in the restaurant business or people who spend a lot of time outdoors.  Heck, it's even a great little accessory for your junk drawer at home.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|Also found this book in the New York Times book review section.  It filled in a lot of gaps in my historical knowledge of that time.
B008476HBM|5.0|Just can't even describe how much I really love this book. The movie is good, but the book is always better!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|The book Persuasion is a great book.  However, the Kindle version is pretty bad.  It really needs editing badly.  Missed words, spelling errors and inappropriate sentence transitions.<br /><br />I think it was free, so no problem.  But you have to do better in your editing.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is a gem of a book. It's wise, fun, and incredibly useful! I will read it again and again.
B00B2166BS|2.0|The magnets are so weak that they pop off at the slightest touch.  It does charge faster than the USB charger.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this for my grandson.  He just loved it!  He got it for Easter!  He couldn't wait till it arrived.
B00979CS50|5.0|As it is with most artists, you either like what Neil Young and Crazy Horse do or you don't.  If you do, you'll like this (2-CD 85 minute) album.  These guys do here what they do best:  straight ahead 4/4 rock and roll with the basic two guitars, bass and drums format.<br /><br />The mix and production are excellent, allowing just a bit of the &#34;sloppiness&#34; that is the hallmark of good rock and roll.  No 80's-style sanitized overproduction, no annoying overdubs, no smothering electronic keyboards or drum machines.  It makes you feel like you're right there listening to a live take in the studio.  My vote for outstanding cut goes to the 27-minute opener, &#34;Driftin' Back.&#34;  Its a great two chord guitar jam anchored by Ralph Molina's snare drum.
B008EQIA7W|4.0|If stars are not enough; please stop asking for my review. I could just as easily not do any of it and just delete your emails.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The second book was awesome! So much drama and detail! Go America!! The author is so descriptive and keeps you wanting more! Can't wait for book three!
B000000Y2F|5.0|This is a very good CD.  In the short period of time that these two giants played together there was not much recorded.  The legendary recording recently discovery of a concert at Carnegie Hall is outstanding and this is a nice addition to that recording.  It is too bad there are not any good &#34;live&#34; recordings when they played their long engagement at the Five Spot in NYC.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I enjoyed the Percy Jackson series a great deal, but this was definitely a step up. Maybe it's because the intended audience is a little older, but there is more depth to the characters this time around. The gods aren't just caricatures, they are real people with all the emotions that come with that. But this added depth doesn't detract from the fun. There is levity and humor, just like in the Percy series, and I very much look forward to reading the rest of them.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book was very well written with a tremendous amount of detail which was not included in the Movie. Very interesting<br />book.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Love Volbeat. it is a great cd with awesome songs.  it is worth buying instead of downloading.  It is a must have for Volbeat fans
B00A8ZZ570|5.0|I have followed Chris Potter since he first joined Dave Holland's great quintet, and was naturally blown away by his inventive and incendiary playing ... this guy has always had chops to spare!  With that being said, in his own recordings as a leader, the playing has never quite lived up to expectations from seeing and hearing the brilliance of his live performances.  In the past, you could hear Potter at his finest when featured on other ECM releases, e.g. Paul Motian's \\"Lost in a Dream\\", and some from the Holland quintet.  With \\"Sirens\\", we finally have the real deal, and the band he has assembled is given more than ample opportunity to shine.  Potter's maturity as a leader is displayed in the beauty and balance achieved on every solo throughout, and in the space he gives to his sidemen.  The audacity of combining Craig Taborn and David Virelles on keyboards for a few of these numbers is another reason \\"Sirens\\" reveals strength upon strength with repeated listens.  Gorgeous.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Aside from grinding my teeth over a few gratuitous historical fantasies, I found this to be an exceptional film, dipping into a very narrow slice of history and bringing it to life with the best cast one could possibly imagine!  All of the characters, with great speaking parts and those with primarily supporting roles, were so well chosen and so realistically portrayed, it is almost impossible to not believe you are a fly on the wall, watching Abraham Lincoln in action.  A truly satisfying experience!  \\"Best Picture\\" by far!
B001LF3YQK|3.0|I think this product is just OK, i have other skip hop products (including the bento diaper bag which i love), but this<br />doesnt make me as appy.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />It's slim and fits easily into my diaper bag<br />It's easy to fill with wipes<br />It's made of sturdy plastic<br /><br />Cons:<br />It's not easy to open (definitely couldn't do it one handed whilst holding baby in place)<br />The red tab comes off and is pretty difficult to get back on<br />The wipes dry out after a couple of days
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really love playing this game it is fun challenging addictive you have to force yourself to stop playing or your kindle will kick the bucket before you decide to quit. I recommend this game for all ages:)
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Mr. Stills is one of the essential guitar players of the '60s. One note and you know who it is. I like the thought of him not writing a bibliography. Frankly, it doesn't matter whether or not he was a pleasant person, who he had relationships with, drugs, alcohol, any of it. What is important is the music. His new box set says all you need to know about the man. Apart from some Buffalo Springfield songs (which any self-respecting fan of good music should already have), all his essential work is here. If you read the notes on who plays what on the songs, particularly the CSN songs, its mostly stills (guitars, keyboards, percussion). Apart from the shared singing and song writing, Stills WAS that band. Consider yourself Gobsmacked!!<br /><br />I do not share much of his political vision. However, I do share his love of roots music. As a player, I have learned much from his recordings and immensely respect the man for his art, skill and strength of character. Long after we are gone, Mr. Stills' music will be included in the set list played by those future people studying music of the distant 20th century. This box set serves effectively as a testiment to his life and work. Buy it.
B009G3T01M|4.0|This is an edited album but since I already had the unedited version I feel I can make a fair review.  First, lyrically & thematically this is a complete album. It has clever yet tight lyrics, w/great vocal hooks & nice production value.  The edited version does dilute the lyrical content somewhat, but for those who don’t want to hear the random f-bomb the sacrifice is worth it without overly damaging the musical flow.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This fixed my kindle Thank you thank you! :) my kindle charges and works great !  Couldn't  be happier with the new cord.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I love word games and this is a fun game.  I love the animation.  I have won a few games and lost a few and the animation if great.  It makes it more fun to play this game.<br /><br />I have the Wheel of Fortune Game and this one is more fun.  It is really worth getting.  I got it when it was free but it is worth buying.
B000F6YPX2|5.0|Love the Allman Brothers!  I don't like the fact that you require a certain number of words for your responses.  What else is there to say about music you love.
0307887960|4.0|The start of the book was slow because of all the examples and testimonies.  It took forever to get to any meat of the diet and explaining how it should work.
0375703764|4.0|I choose this because it was in the top 20 horror novels.  This was a great book. I love that it is so different than anything I have ever read.  I loved the fact there would be 1 word on a page, or you have to turn the book sideways, or upside down, or read on an angle. Love it.  Genius!
1401323820|5.0|I purchased this for my Mother in law at Christmas. I had her name for the blind gift exchange. She loved it.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I purchased this game for my grandson's 7th birthday.  I haven't had a chance to see it in use, but my son tells me that the whole family enjoys playing it and that it encourages creativity in my grandson and his 9-year-old sister.  Their parents have fun with it, as well.  Both my son and daughter-in-law are architects, and their kids are naturally creative, so it is a natural for them.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|I bought this for my mother in law at Christmas. I had her name for the blind draw. She loved it.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Very impressive. music is right on, great selections that show Trower's talents to the max. The recording is very good too, good mix and clean, just what we want. A good addition to any collection out there, GET IT!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love it.  One of the best games I have ever played.  I highly recommend this game for fans of Jaws.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I give this a 5star.  It kept you interested.  There were a lot of twists and turns.  I would definitely recommend to others to read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome Awesome Awesome! Who wouldn't want a little jetpack fun! If I rate this 5 stars then I know you are going to have a lot of fun! Enjoy the app!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The writers for this show do a wonderful job. Watching this show transports me to another time and place. The acting is brilliant.
0810970686|2.0|Our grandson was very disappointed to find the spine broken. But he was so anxious to read it we glued it together.
1594484805|5.0|Dan Pink gives useful insight about how to improve the way organizations run. I would be very interested to see if similar autonomy-expanding approaches could be utilized in corporations in Asia, which are still largely run using carrot-stick approaches.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Great series of games with different things to do in every title released. Gives my child an excuse to &#34;ask nicely&#34; for my tablet lol!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is more than I can or could have asked for oil terribly.thankful for his work of words surpassing much and more.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|She loves the animals and all the different things to do in every Panda game. Worth every penny! It's cute and funny at the same time and makes her laugh and giggle along whenever she plays any of the titles.
B008XBHIEY|4.0|The movie Jaws is an amazing movie if you like horror movies, especially shark horror movies. This movie is about an island called Amity that is known for its beaches and its exotic ocean life. This island is attacked by a great white shark and the people have to stop this shark from devouring more people.<br />  I think this is the best shark movie created, its way better than Deep Blue sea, NOT CHEESY. This is a great movie because it shows the development of the people such as Brody and skipper, from being a police officer and marine biologists, to shark hunters, and how they change in dangerous situations. Not only that the story is great but the characters act perfect.<br /> The only downside of this movie is the fact that the shark looks fake and the rating; I don't know how they rated it but its PG when it should be PG13 because of language and some stuff not meant for kids.<br />I recommend this movie if you love horror movies and (if you are a cheap buyer.) you can get it for only 3 bucks that's 1/5 the amount of the original amount which is $15. Get it!<br /><br />- Matthew

B008JFUO4U|4.0|OBLIVION is a gorgeous movie to look at.  It's a marvel of brown and gray.  Tom Cruise is a charismatic movie star.  Those two elements alone make the film worth seeing.  And it's a good thing OBLIVION has those things going for it, because much of the rest is so-so at best.<br /><br />I appreciated the steady , slow-paced build of this film...it is not very action heavy, short of one extended (and disjointed) shootout in an underground bunker facility.  We really mostly spend A LOT of time in closeup with Tom Cruise, with a gorgeously ravaged earth all around him.<br /><br />We meet Cruise as he's setting out on another \\"drone repair\\" mission to earth...and earth that was essentially obliterated during a war with alien invaders.  We won the war, but had to abandon the ruined planet.  Cruise and his partner/lover (Andrea Riseborough) are all alone on a station build well above the surface of the planet.  Below, the cities and farmlands are all covered in dunes.  The top of the Empire State Building is all that pokes through the surface...most of the rest of NYC is buried.  Offshore, gigantic machines, serviced by drones, are pulling up the water from our oceans and are used up in a fusion process to bring energy to Saturn's moon, Titan...where the remnants of humanity have fled.<br /><br />Riseborough (an actress I don't know well, but who makes for an interesting, striking figure) stays on the station, while Cruise yearns to spend more and more time on earth.  He has no memories of the planet, but he has an infinite interest in what life was like there.  His passion for his work and for the planet are what draw us to his character.  Cruise is seldom a truly great actor.  But he's one of those stars (like Clooney) who are charismatic and engaging.  Cruise is usually helped by having a character with a dark side or a past...and we get hints of both.  He carries himself with both great physical assurance AND air of sadness.<br /><br />And the earth around him, bleak and nearly empty, is a CGI wonder.  I know that almost all of it is completely \\"fake\\" but the special effects teams have done a stellar job in creating a convincing, post-apocalyptic world that is lovely to look at.  I enjoyed the many scenes where Cruise flies around.  I'm so tired of bloated CGI worlds, be they Middle Earth or Thor's home planet or any other gilded, over-stuffed fantasy world.  OBLIVION feels \\"tasteful.\\"  The color palette, from Riseborough's clothing to the hue of the sand dunes, is soothing and creative.<br /><br />Needless to say, the movie is not just about Cruise flying around earth.  Slowly and surely, the reality he thought he knew begins to come under assault, both from external factors and from bits of memory that come back to him.  I won't say more, because the movie wants you to slowly unravel its mysteries.  I won't spoil them, although I think they are not terribly inventive in the long run.  Eventually, other characters are introduced, and they are not well fleshed out, even for a sci-fi story.  Olga Kurylenko appears and I left to wonder again (as I did for QUANTUM OF SOLACE and HIT MAN) how she gets large movie roles.  She is bland and uninteresting.  Morgan Freeman is on hand, but does little more than talk like Freeman...it's barely a performance.<br /><br />I'll say again, it's a good thing the experienced and engaging Cruise is on hand to be our tour guide.  With a less compelling star, the less-original-than-its-creators-think plot and the mostly non-existent character development would doom this film.  As it is, I found enough here to like and to recommend the film.  I give it 3.5 stars, but will round up to 4.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|wasnt sure if this light would illuminate the flag enough, but it does a great job, we have a 16ft pole and fly a 3x5 American flag, the led light illuminates it very well, and about a 7ft area on the ground which is great for the flower bed around the pole.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My son loves this game, I even play it occasionally.  You can collect carts, fill orders, check the customers out, weigh products, do aisle clean-up, and load groceries into customers cars.
B00A6SZRJ0|5.0|The music composition is terrific and the engineering on the CD itself makes it a treat to listen to.  This is particularly true when you can listen to it played back through Audio Research Reference tube electronics and get the detail and the subtly in the music.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is one of the better games on my KIndle. However. I refuse to buy extra hearts. I do love to play .Amazon has done a good job.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Very graphic...too graphic in the descriptions of what the animals did, what the humans did. I would not suggest this book for anyone but someone who enjoys reading about blood, guts and just disgusting things.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I loved this show during its original run. From the shaky camera work, to the characters. What makes this show is that it's not polished, and none of the police on the show are without flaws.<br /><br />No spoilers here, but plenty of surprises from the very first episode. Important things are the Captain's quest for a city council seat, the Strike Team trying to keep it together, Dutch and Claudette investigating serial killers, and Julian Lowe's training.
0374533571|5.0|This book is so sweet and relatable.  These are real people, with real problems and you can see where they get those problems from.  You want things to come out well in the end because it could be you, your friends, family and neighbors.  What a lovable cast of characters.  Nicely done.
B00006FDCD|3.0|For technological novices like myself, the double-sided disk threw me. Call me stupid, but I didn't realize you could record on both sides, and there's nothing on the package that indicates you have to flip the DVD to watch Part II of the miniseries. It \\"ended\\" halfway through and until I figured it out (I told you I'm dense), I felt gypped. The miniseries itself isn't bad, plus it features a very young Seth Green! It's a bit drawn out, as most miniseries are, and could have benefited from tighter editing and a clearer connection between which young boy was which man as an adult. But there have been far worse Stephen King adaptations for TV. A friend of mine saw it as a kid and has been terrified of clowns since, but if I'd seen it years ago, it would have only stoked my crazy, irrational fears of pool grates and drains. I was terrified even of touching them - not sure if anyone else shares this fear, but definitely a movie that sticks with you if you have weird phobias. Now I want to read the original King paperback.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Movie is boring but has some entertainment value at times. Typical Tarantino dark-comedy dealing with racist issues that need to be put to bed once and for all.....JMHO
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Like many, I have been a fan of Tom Clancy since reading The Hunt for Red October. Along with Robert Ludlum, he defined a genre in the 1980s that was my escape from long work weeks and too much stress. I still have not come to terms with this emergence of branded novels that are written by hired guns. On the one hand, I ponder whether or not I would be able to tell the difference if there was no public acknowledgement of the existence of a third-party author. I would like to say that I would, but I am probably deluding myself.<br /><br />So, with that caveat, I found this book to be true to the well-established formula of the genre. It was entertaining and - most importantly - worth my time and the price of the download. But I can't help but feel that it falls short of what the master himself would have produced before he had to dedicate most of his time to managing an entertainment empire that has made him more money than he ever dreamed possible.<br /><br />I am sure that I will pony up to the bar and plunk my hard-earned currency down for the next novel that churns off the Clancy production line. That fact is probably more a reflection of the dearth of worthy talent out there that is still too poor to hire ghost writers and internal editorial departments. In the meantime, I will continue my search for the next Tom Clancy or James Patterson who still writes for a living.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I love thrillers like this one. Although there are holes in the plot, I still enjoy it. The craftiness of the movie takes you on a roller coaster ride of events that don't let you go until the end
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I really liked The Selection and was very much looking forward to The Elite. Unfortunately, I knew pretty soon into starting the book that it was not what I was hoping for and I was getting a bit agitated with the character of America (and even Aspen). I get that the author wanted a trilogy since that is the hot thing these days but what was the point of the second book if it is going to end in the same place it started?<br /><br />America flip flops on her feelings for Maxon and Aspen every other chapter and it all seems very superficial. There isn't a deep dive into America's thoughts/inner struggle; instead it just seems to \\"happen\\" based on an event at the palace. It also infuriates me that she risks her life/well-being chapter after chapter (especially after the Marlee incident) with Aspen especially if she claims to care about him (and the well-being of her family) so so much. Don't be an idiot, America, you're going to get caught at some point by someone.<br /><br />Beware, there are a lot of questions that get brought up (or were from the first book) but don't get answered in this book. It seemed the book got cut off at an odd place and it left open questions between America and many other characters: the bracelet Maxon noticed, the phone number, the rebel girl, ect.) I would have preferred if this book just kept going through the final selection since it's pretty clear that either America will choose Maxon or something tumultuous will happen that will put America in an important position. If this happened than Book 3 could have been about the post-Selection dramatics of war, rebels, a wedding, ect. As much as I want to see a happy ending for America and Maxon, I do want to see how much impact it makes on the entire government.<br /><br />Now all of that being said, it was still an enjoyable read. It was a quick read, too quick since the next book probably will not be out until next year.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I'm not going to install this update because of the excessive permissions it is asking for. It is NONE of Amazon's business which accounts exist on my device and which networks are connected. This is on principle, there is nothing to hide. I never install apps which ask for such invasive and unnecessary permissions. In my book the new Kindle app for Android v4.0.1.3 is a breach of my privacy. I'll keep using the old version, thank you.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|this was an awesome show and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is bc the video quality amd speed wasn't the greatest
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I think this was a little more slow than the original GOT but I liked it.  I read it after watching season 2 on HBO and that was nice.  It filled in the gaps.  I wish I had watched Season 3 & 4 before reading the next book but I just had to keep reading.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I like this App because it allows independent artist and producers to promote, showcase, and advertise their musical creativity; giving them a broader fan base option.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book represents seasons 3 & 4 of the TV series.  However, I couldn't wait and I plowed into the book.  I find it lessens how much I enjoy the TV series but I get my GOT fix every night in bed.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What a sad but yet lovely story about two orphans in different decades from each other...each their own stories, and coming together to share.  A beautiful, and often sad book, and I couldn't put it down!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Classic fantasy.  I read it after watching season 1 on HBO and that was nice.  It filled in the gaps.  I wish I had watched Season 3 & 4 before reading the corresponding books but I just had to keep reading.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|With so much going on in the world these days I like a good Sci Fi movie to get away from it all and the Transfer Movies hit the spot.

0345803485|1.0|I'm not wasting my time writing a detailed review of this absolute muck.  I read it out of pure curiosity, and smirked, laughed and guffawed throughout - not because of any humor, but because of the remedial writing.  Honestly, it's cringeworthy how badly written this book is.  Never mind the stupid plot and awkward sex scenes, the entire book reads as if it was written by a 14 year old girl.<br /><br />The success of this book is a damning indictment of the average level of intelligence in our society.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Not as good as the stage production but nevertheless , I loved it. The singing voices were good but again, no comparison to the stage production.
B007PVHANM|5.0|True to Bob Marley, most enjoyable and enlightening report on the good and bad times of Bob's life !! A document to keep for life
B0065GC0PG|5.0|I loved the premise with the broad interpretation of Cinderella!  A great adventure story that kept me turning the pages!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|For some, this final entry into the Wheel of Time may seem a little long winded. It certainly is a long book, with one chapter near 200 pages long. That said; it is the Last Battle! It shouldn't be concise. This is the final book in a massive series, who would want an abrupt ending for characters that some readers have been enjoying for nearly a quarter century.<br />Sanderson does an excellent job of completing Jordan's life's work, finally bringing closure to many a grateful reader. I laughed out loud a few times, nearly cried while reading at the gym, and was literally stunned at least three times while listening to the audio book.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Speedy and good overall purchase of this cd. Scotty McCreery is a must have if you are an idol fan.
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|the music and animation take me back to the golden age of disney. mandy moore did an excellent job. would also recommend the soundtrack.
B0035F0MTG|4.0|I have to admit I find Ms. Wang's justifications for the disc's program a tad vague, but there is no questioning the repertoire selections themselves, which override any personal qualms about their inclusion. My only serious, if minor, concern after listening to the disc is that I found myself more or less admiring Ms. Wang's technical mastery of the piano without quite actually falling in love with the music. She is without doubt an accomplished and virtuosic player, but whether every listener will appreciate the feeling, the heart, behind her playing is another matter. While everyone will react differently to Ms. Wang's interpretations, I don't think anyone would question the fact that her pianistic skills are dazzling.<br /><br />Some of my favorite piano recordings are on DG, and this new one from Yuja Wang is no exception. The audio engineers appear to have miked the piano rather closely, yet it produces a pleasingly robust bloom, with a solid bass, an exceptionally clear and colorful midrange, and a slightly forward top end. For the kind of music making Ms. Wang engages in here--largely vigorous and stimulating--the sonics seem ideal.<br /><br />John J. Puccio<br />Classical Candor
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Spoiler Alert....don't read.....I was heartbroken at the loss of some of the characters in this series.  I'm shocked that they chose to leave.  It was such a damper to my love of the series....my thoughts are shared by absolutely everyone in my circle of friends.

B00005JLEX|5.0|No comments needed,. Took the programmes on my boating holiday last year and enjoyed every programme despite having seen some before
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Harry Bosch is a wonderful character, and one of my favorites in the world of detective novels.  &#34; The Overlook&#34; doesn't disappoint.  The story is full of suspense and unexpected twists and turns. The portrait of police life and politics shows that Connelly has real inside knowledge of these topics.  Bosch is both frustrating and empathetic.  In each of these novels I really care about the outcome. Connelly is a very talented writer.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|great game but SEVERAL times when I level up it does not give me a gold bar!!! which is total bull!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I started watching this show after my wife told me how good it was, we watch totally different types of shows, I like action/adventure, she likes shows where everyone is nice all the time, after watching the first show on Amazon Prime I was totally hooked. I watched every show from season 1 and 2 in about a week, and cant wait for the summer to get here for season 3. It will surprise you with the aliens, they are great looking. You wont be disappointed.

B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|I think that overall, this is their most consistent and best release. I'm glad that they are moving forward and exploring new ground. I am also glad that this album doesn't ever wear out its welcome. Unlike a few of their others cds, I feel like I want to listen to the cd again rather than be happy that it's over.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I choose this CD because I like her others.  The Live opening is refreshing.  I recommend it to those which enjoy Sarah.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|We appear to be random subjects for the choices of the universe.  These teens attempt a romance set near the end of their cancer laden lives.<br />Things happen,both probable and improbable. The crisis of death in an awakening relationship leads to a sad but sweet final curtain call.  3 1/3 stars
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|It's been a long time coming but Justin is back on top with this one. This CD has a mature sound to it that goes from the club to a more intimate setting with no problem.<br /><br />Definitely recommend

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|EXCELLENT. The Blu Ray arrived promptly after I placed the order. Also, the Blu Ray was excellent; no skips or lags or any defects of any kind. I usually don't leave reviews, but I was too extremely satisfied not to leave a review!!!!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  It is definitely my favorite Bruno Mars CD.  I loved every song on it and highly recommend it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is amazing<br />Everyone should try it. It keeps you wanting to come back.  Try it you will love it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It has a hook you can not figure out what will happen next. I also like the conection between the upper and lower class.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I just unlocked my fourth of the six endings, and I'm trying to convince myself to do chores instead of continuing to play. I think my efforts to convince myself of this will be in vain.<br /><br />I have never been one for story lines in games, but this one is not only necessary but incredibly interesting. The characters have intertwined relationships that slowly reveal themselves through game play.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, with each play-through, you do have to go through every conversation again. Even with fast-forwarding, I find this at least a little bit annoying. However, it's completely worth it. I keep thinking that each play-through will reveal very little more than the previous, but I have always been wrong so far. I've only played 5 times so far, but I would still call that excellent replay value (which was obviously the intention).<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that they put way more into the budget of the story and general programming than images/animation, but the former are so good that it does not matter even the slightest that there are just a few sprites per character.<br /><br />My advice is to take very detailed notes with each run-through. Note whom you take with you, which path you take, how you respond to people's questions, etc. Most definitely note which doors you go through and solutions to puzzles as well. Draw out maps of each level, and write where you find each key and key card as well as where you have to go to use each.<br /><br />Every run has been an absolute blast. The music gets your heart racing, and comments the other characters make get the gears turning about the story's background. They're often funny in their wit as well.<br /><br />I most definitely agree with others that this game is in no way for children, which honestly makes it a great go-to game for adults like me who love the DS (because so much is geared to a younger audience with the DS). If you are easily offended by curse words, gory descriptions, and the occasional highly suggestive comment, this game is certainly not for you. For the rest, you need to make this the next game on your list and prepare to be hooked.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Great Album! Broken and Heaven are really good songs! If you're a true DM fan you will not be disappointed!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Not a big fan, I guess I don't get the addiction. The game is pretty repetitive. If you want to try itit seems to run well

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game. I always play. This game is better than temple run 2 I hope there is a update for it soon.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|You are an awesome author.....I will be reading the rest of the series soon! Thanks for the good book! Au revior!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this -- the characters were good, the science was interesting, and it had a quick pace. And only 99 cents!
B00B22IJXK|5.0|I was super bored so i decided to look on the app store.......<br />I saw this app and bought it..... and as i started exploring it<br />It got even more awesome. - TOTALLY BUY IT!!!!!!!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|A tremendous collection of rock musicians and original songs. Be sure to watch the making of several songs on the album on the internet.
0811874192|4.0|I purchased this book because I was impressed with the idea of having a table bouquet from pop ups/paper engineering.  I was impressed upon receiving it that there are light paper inserts to help protect the pages.  For some reason though, the tropical flower arrangement doesn't open quite right.  The other arrangements open well and are pretty (and no pollen or dead flowers ;o)).I was just expecting to be more wowed by the arrangements - the reason for the four stars.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|It was a little challenging for my 10-year-old to figure out where the batteries went, and we had to find a really tiny screwdriver to do it. But once they were in, he thought it was &#34;awesome!&#34;

B00406RMOM|5.0|I am very disappointed that season 5 will be it's last season. Merlin is a fun watch. It's loaded with drama, action, humor, romance and great actors. I was a little leery at first to watch this show. As I am not a big fan of this genre, but I am so so glad that I did. I sure hope that the powers that be change their minds, get their heads out their arses, and keep Merlin around for a few more seasons.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|This was the worst version of a great play I have ever seen. Also, the Blu-ray disc did not work so it was returned to Amazon. Back to the review of the regular dvd...The singing was so off-key, at first I thought it was a joke. The dialog was all sung (badly) and was impossible to enjoy anything about it. We (my husband & I) stopped watching it at the half-way point. We just couldn't take it anymore. I don't understand how this had so many rave reviews, except perhaps, the reviewers never saw the actual play. This was absolutely terrible. If I could give it a negative rating, I would. The lowest rating is one star...and that's stretching it.
B004EHZPEG|5.0|I don't typically submit reviews, but this book was so well-written that I'd be remiss in my duty as a human if I didn't recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter.<br /><br />An incredibly responsible view of game design is given in the last few chapters that gave my faith in humanity a welcomed boost.
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|There's been a lot of talk on here about this being &#34;leftover&#34; material and that it shouldn't count as a real New Order album. I thoroughly enjoyed this and have been playing it nonstop. The first song &#34;I&#34;ll Stay With You&#34; could easily have been a single. This is a must-have for any true New Order fan.
B009AMANBA|2.0|when i bought it i was thinking it was going to be about lincoln and have his life more not about the 13th amndment.<br />i would not tell my friends to buy it it was such a hard movie to follow.
B00755MHXG|4.0|An engaging read which presents a myriad of complex issues through the eyes of a young person.  I really enjoyed the structure, gaining an insight into the same events through different eyes.  Since finishing the book my niece and nephew have also read and enjoyed it.
1481879103|5.0|This is a very entertaining and original story peopled with such well-drawn characters, I felt like I got to know them personally. At no point in the story did I know exactly where it was heading, which held my interest as well as the very realistic and witty banter between the characters who each had very well-defined personalities. The ending was such a surprise I had to retrace my steps a bit to see how the author pulled it off without tipping his hand. Very well done, indeed.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book took me a chapter or two to get into, but once I did I couldn't put it down!!!  I would recommend this book to anyone, it was terrific!!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Sound track goes in and out, bad sound.  Picture it self was great.  If you liked the stage play you will like the movie.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I'm not normally a big sequel person, more often than not the sequel is an acceptable movie but doesn't have the same magic of the first in the series. Not true for the Boondock Saints. This movie is not only a great standalone piece but it fits with all the magic and fun of the first one. Arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|So so good. Feeling like I was looking thru his eyes at the enemy. He really made me more aware of thoughs that struggled with coming home to an unwelcome America at the time.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I thought the whole thing was very well done.  I have read criticism of Russell Crow but I think he played his part brilliantly.  He was not supposed to be a sympathetic character.  He could not show caring for any individual or he would not have done his job as he felt it should be done.  Thus we get the cold unbending person he played. Crow conveyed this very very well.  I loved everything about this movie.  As for the singing-think stage production not slick musical. There again everyone was excellent at conveying the feelings of the moment. I will watch it again and again.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|It is fun and very awesome but it makes my kindle go slow but I consider getting the resteraunt story
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is one of those very few games that really is free, with the exception of buying extra powerups. There are a few glitches, but not nearly as much as other similar games. I do wish there was a past/present option like others though. Great job GI.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|There's something about Ghost where I can listen to the same album repeatedly all day long and never get bored of it. I did that with Opus Eponymous and now I've got Infestissumam on repeat.<br /><br />It's a very enjoyable album, just as the first one was. Someone in the band has great song-writing skills and it shows. I love their chord changes/progressions and different changeups. It's more than just a collection of cool metal riffs, you can tell they really take their time trying to craft a good solid song. And I hope Ghost realizes that their strong point is their music and not the image. The image is fun, but I hope they continue to focus on great song writing and don't start relying on image alone (I'm sure it's tempting, many have done it before).<br /><br />I love this album, but I must say that it seems like the last 3 or 4 tracks or so aren't nearly as good as the first half of the album. It looses its momentum a bit and it seems like the band is experimenting with a couple ideas, but it misses the mark just a bit. An example of something I didn't think quite worked was the female choir type part (2:00 in) in Depth of Satan's Eyes. I like that they're experimenting and trying different things but that one particular moment didn't quite work for me.<br /><br />One other minor miss for me is the ending of Zombie Queen. I love how it ends except for the last second, where they just hit the 2 notes to finish. They should have either faded it out or chosen a different 2 notes or something. Something about it seems slightly off.<br /><br />All in all though, this is a great album, and it's definitely worth purchasing. If I had to compare it to the first album, I'd say the first one was a 10/10 and this one might be a 9/10, only because I didn't think the second half was as solid. But it still kicks ass. I'm already looking forward to Ghost's next album! Keep giving us some great tunes!
B004V01VUS|4.0|Each time I tink Neil Gaiman is going to follow a well traveled story arc, he deviates here and there until you end up with something original and magical all on it's own. He doesn't disappoint with this book. In some ways, it is a coming of age book, both Tristran and the star growing and changing by the end. There's trickery, ships of the sky, and a unicorn. The tale is also sprinkled with every day stuff, such as Tristran taking a shovel with him into the woods to make a little deposit. Such little things help to make the characters, and the experience, real.<br /><br />As much as I love Gaiman's work, I do have 2 small issues with this book. Obviously, they don't break the book for me as I have read it multiple times. It's good to love some flawed things in your life - aunties, vases, yourself, and books. So much growing up happens between the lines, and much of it within 6 pages where it isn't really described. So, while I get to know Tristran as a young man bumbling through life, and then I see him as a young man having made up his mind about several things and gained the confidence to follow through, the in between stuff was left out. The second point is a mild SPOILER: the star goes from being captured by Tristran, to being obligated to be by his side for an unforeseeable amount of time to loving him. I never really got the sense that she fell, totally, utterly, head over heels in love with him. Rather, what started as an intolerable obligation later became a tolerable arrangement. END SPOILER

It's sad that this is what passes for literature these days and that so many reviewers can read it and make comments like \\"well written.\\"  It reads like a second draft.  The author needs an impartial editor and to spend a little more time learning how to write.

1742200508|5.0|Lonely Planet puts out some great guide books. This new one for England, published earlier this year (2013), is no exception. About 850 pages chock full of useful information covering about everything a visitor needs to know.<br /><br />I haven't been to England in a number of years and have not seen much outside of the London area when I have gone there. Hope to change that soon. If I keep thumbing through this guidebook, it might just happen this year. So many interesting things to see and do - England isn't that big, but sure has a lot packed into a small space. I also have friends there I have not seen in a long time.<br /><br />Maybe I should check the flights.<br /><br />If you're going to England or just like to read about it, check this book out.
0385349947|4.0|Sheryl Sandberg is earnest.  She really thinks she's figured out some solutions for helping women rise to the top.  Women need to stop holding themselves back, speak up and really be more assertive, women need to help each other, women need to stop feeling guilty, workplaces need to be more accomodating, and, most importantly, they need to find a good man.  I don't disagree with many of these points, but Ms. Sandberg overestimates how easy it is for women to satisfy this formula.  Yes, she's right - a woman needs a good partner.  She even gives tips for finding that perfect man who'll pack lunches and accommodate your ambitious schedule.  Well, no matter how much you plan, things don't always work out so perfectly.  It's hard to predict how Mr. Perfect will behave once the kids are actually there.  Mr. Perfect may not have a flexible schedule (and he may not want one).  Mr. Perfect might face health issues.  Mr. Perfect may turn out to be a cheater.  He may decide marriage is not for him?  And then what?  Ms. Sandberg calls the choice of spouse the single most important career choice a woman can make.  But there's absolutely no way to guarantee a fairytale ending at home or in the workplace.  Are Single mothers out of luck?  She has absolutely no discussion of how single women are supposed to \\"lean in\\" and be constantly available when there's no one to fall back on.<br /><br />As I'm sure other commenters have noted, this book also isn't about \\"regular\\" women.  It's aimed at a very small subset of women - elite women who have the potential to reach the highest echelons in their fields.  I think Ms. Sandberg makes this clear from the beginning, as the question is why aren't there more women CEOs/law firm partners etc.  So I don't think this is a HUGE fault.  However, the subset of women is even tinier as it's aimed at elite women who are either unmarried or are in happy marriages where the husband is a full partner.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think she needs to rethink the idea that a woman's success is dependent on her choice of spouse.  Yes, a great, accommodating, flexible spouse certainly helps.  But that can't be the solution because it leaves a heck of a lot of women out in the cold and it also unfairly assumes that women have sufficient control and predictive powers that they can choose Mr. Perfect BEFORE they have kids and know that he will be the ideal partner.  While we all hope that is the case, 50% of marriages end in divorce.  We need a workplace that accommodates all sorts of women/mothers - particularly since single Moms generally have no choice but to be in the workplace and therefore have to lean in under conditions that are far more difficult than the conditions that Ms. Sandberg faces.the idea that a woman's success is dependent on her choice of spouse.

1451620829|5.0|Hands down, the best KISS autobiography yet. Sincere and honest, Peter takes responsibility for his own actions while also pointing fingers at others. The stories definitely ring true.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Did not expect it to end this way. Well,I did,but for a moment there i thought everyone was going to die. Such a great series.

B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like this game it so much fun for all ages! I recommend that you buy it!! I think any one will like it!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Afflect did a stellar job of creating tension!  Just remember, when you're watching it, that it's not a history lesson.  Liberties have to be taken sometimes to advance the story.  It is a great story and Affleck does a great job of telling it.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|First of all, I loved The Selection. I loved how the author put all the girls in a situation like that and how each one had their own background. I read some reviews about this book and I read about 10. Half of them were bad, but half of them loved this book so much that they can't wait for the next one. I wasn't sure I wanted to read it, because of some of the bad reviews it was getting but I have to admit it was WAY better than I was expecting. The rebels come in more, some un-expected things happen and America has to make some major decisions. I didn't like some of it, America was a bit bratty, I thought, but that is to be expected when someone is competing for the same guy against several girls. But overall, I really enjoyed myself and could hardly put it down. I just wish I don't have to wait a whole year to read the next one, but I'm sure the next one will be even better.<br />So if you enjoyed the first one, I'm sure you will enjoy this one to and don't let the bad reviews make you not read it, you may think it will be amazing.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT?: You are going to either end up loving Prince Maxon or Aspen, there are only two sides now. Can't be borderline, trust me, I tried. Oh and don't hate Mason right away, you will learn some things that you never even saw coming.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good story kept me interested. Couldn't put it down. Wanted to read what the character was going to encounter next chapter. Of the three books this one is the best.

B00BIVN82M|3.0|I'm a big Bubl&eacute; fan, have him on the stereo a lot, so any new recording of his is more than welcome.  I will say, however, that I was less impressed with \\"To Be Loved\\" than I have been with past albums.  I think, for me, there's a sameness here -- a deja vu, if you will -- that I find a bit dispiriting.  I certainly don't want Bubl&eacute; to reinvent himself -- he does what he does -- but his few-and-far-between releases are becoming predictable and bland.  I know exactly which recording a Jane Monheit, John Mayer or Sugarland track is from (I have diverse tastes), but couldn't possibly say the same for Bubl&eacute;.  Formula is one thing, formulaic another.  That said, Michael sounds terrific, as usual, particularly on \\"Close Your Eyes,\\" and the energy of \\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"After All\\" is infectious.  I've always found \\"Something Stupid\\" to be...well, something stupid, so there.  Other than that, this is a pretty predictable set; not bad, but not particularly exciting.  I for one, would like to see Bubl&eacute; take a few more chances next time around.  How about just him and a piano, or him and a jazz quartet?  Something more intimate, less geared to stadium shows.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The story is about the early adventures of Bilbo Baggins, the hobbit, and is a vast improvement over the much earlier animated film. As expected, the CGI is wonderful and the artfulness of the film is striking. My only reason for awarding only four stars is the films length. At times I found myself getting bored with the predictable action. Other than that, The Hobbit is an entertaining adventure that sets the stage nicely for the earlier Lord of the Rings series.

160774273X|5.0|My sister gave me Ken Forkish's Flour Water Salt Yeast last holiday season. I hadn't heard of the book, but its title let me know plenty by its clear and bold allusion to the French legal restrictions for commercial bread bakeries. I have no culinary background, neither do I have any amateur pretensions in the kitchen. In my profession I taught research writing methods and techniques and technical writing (among other things), and read and evaluated many manuals and textbooks. Also, I lived for a summer outside Paris and travelled in northern France. France's reputation for its breads is justified. Since 1988 I've owned several bread-making machines and have relied on them nearly exclusively, and have occasionally bought breads from artisanal bakeries and other specialty bakeries, such as Great Harvest (for the unique whole-wheat loaves). I've relied on some of the better books for using a bread machine, often only for dough-making while finishing the loaf in the oven; also I've used conventional bread books, interpolating the recipes and methods for my machine.<br /><br />The breads I've made from Ken Forkish's book have been the best breads I've ever had. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that his Flour Water Salt Yeast becomes the standard and authoritative text for most or all culinary institutes and schools; it is outstanding as a text and reference work. More, his personal authority as a master baker appears on every page, his great affection for the most delicious breads always turning the reader's learning into a leavening tutorial, as it were.<br /><br />While reading the book I became convinced that it contained and revealed the most important truths about making bread. Before, I had read deeply about bread making but always more or less despaired from ever making great bread because I've lacked the patience; great bread requires time, many hours of it, days and weeks if it's to be done right with a levain or sourdough. Yet Forkish's thorough explanations and directions gave me new hope. His text is as much about bread philosophy and aesthetics as about technique and method. That is, his book is both scholarly and artful, and rather delightful to read.<br /><br />Being convinced, I purchased a digital scale, oven thermometer, mixing tubs, brotforms, and a very fine 4.5-quart Dutch oven. However, I chose to use my bread machine for the pre-ferment step and for the folding and resting steps. The machine is a Panasonic SD-YD250 I've used for several years; it's a very thoughtful and gentle machine, I've come to know it, and I figured it could produce the right kind of bread dough since it used the same amounts of time for folding and resting as Forkish's book describes. I made half of the book's recipes since the machine cannot accommodate twice the amounts. After the machine completed the final dough formation, I followed Ken's directions scrupulously for shaping, proofing, and baking. I've made all the pre-ferment breads and overnight breads, but have not tried any levains. Every loaf has turned out perfect, most look exactly like the book's pictures, and as I've said, I've never had better bread, anywhere. I believe I've had the same sensory pleasures as Ken describes. Really, it's intoxicating and essentially a new experience and pleasure about bread, like attaining the Holy Grail. My search has ended.<br /><br />I've used King Arthur all-purpose flour, as Ken uses in his home test kitchen, and Trader Joe's all-purpose flour (also King Arthur's whole-wheat and Trader Joe's whole-wheat), unaware of any differences in any of the many qualities of the finished breads.<br /><br />(I've made some pizzas using the book's methods, and I could write pages about the book's insights and my successes, but I'm still experimenting ... .)<br /><br />I halve the finished and cooled loaf, cut half into slices and freeze them. The bread freezes well: I microwave the frozen slice for 10-15 seconds and make toast (which is heavenly).<br /><br />Often, readers look at the first few sentences of a review, notice the review's length, then look at the ending part.<br /><br />I've tried to contribute my experience of combining Ken Forkish's methods in his outstanding Flour Water Salt Yeast book with a modern, full-feature bread-making machine. I'll add that an important feature of a good reference manual is that it lies flat when opened to any page, and this book also does that very well.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I finished the book in two days and it was amazing. I was almost falling off my set from reading this.
B008220D7S|3.0|This movie was entertaining, but not necessarily the sequel to\\"Knocked Up\\" as it was billed. In the end, I enjoyed it and thought it was funny and told a story of the importance of family. It's a good movie, not great and not a \\"must have\\".
B009GED3HS|5.0|Easy to purchase and download was quick. great way to watch episodes missed our that are not on hulu yet

B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is by far the best bingo game I've found.  No problems logging into facebook and syncing on my Kindle Fire.  The only problem I have is that I can receive gifts but everytime I try to send a gift, I get an &quot;error&quot; message, so that makes it impossible to trade for hard to get items. That's why I give it four stars instead of five.
B00B05Z77U|5.0|A must read for every introvert!  I had no idea that there was so much research, and found it all fascinating. Wish I could have read all of the info many years ago.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great app. i downloaded this for my kindle and it is as good or better than the one that came on my computer.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Wow, this thing does it all.  It is really convenient to have on your tablet and it works very well.  I won't use it for all that it offers, but it is nice to have those features.  Can't imagine a better calculator out there.
B009AMANBA|3.0|This movie is good but was over hyped. Parts were great, actors were above average but the hype made the movie hard to rate versus the reality.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Game is great fun to play. Mission orientated makes it fun and easy to play. Would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing simulation based games
B009EAO38C|5.0|They take the best songs and make them better! Check out their music videos on YouTube! The are really funny!
B0015XHQTE|5.0|EXCELLENT,if you are a fan of the DIRTY HARRY films then i highly recommend this collection.You get all 5 DIRTY HARRY films with top notch,excellent audio video.The price is unbelievably cheap but the packaging isnt and there are plenty of extras about each film and also great segments on Clint Eastwood himself,as well as interviews with Clint and the supporting cast of each movie. If you have only seen these movies on television your being cheated because they cut out so much. Not here,each film is gloriously in its entirety.This is one of the best movie collection packages out there,so guys,grab a cold one,sit back in your recliner and enjoy what movies used to be,and ladies,with Farthers day soon upon us,order this up for your man.He wont be dissapointed.
B003A8YOE2|5.0|When I say more, I mean more of this talented artist's music available in the English language.  I've bought other European singer's albums in the past who were better known overseas but had released albums in Englsh and I was glad to get them; now, I have another to enjoy in library.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Took me a while but really enjoyed the game. Fun and challenging but not &quot;impossible&quot;.  Really liked the graphics and I thought they were unique.  Can't speak for the sound because I always keep the sound off.  (Insomnia and a husband that gets up at 4:30 A.M.)
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I'm odd man out.  Everyone raved about this movie so I rented it.  I didn't care for the story or most of the actors. But each to their own.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I consider this the weakest of the series, but, I had to have this for my collection. My wife however, loves the movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I had seen the stage musical four times and loved it.  I also saw the old film with Liam Neeson and Uma Thurman, but I remembered wishing they sang in that movie just like in the musical.  Luckily, this movie they sing it all the way through as it was meant to be.  I'm actually not a fan of musicals, but there are a few exceptions and this is one of them.  Les Miserables is known for its music, but in this movie I got to see them re-create the story with stunning visual and fantastic acting.  I had some criticisms about this, but they were minor.  I'm a huge fan of Russell Crowe, but his voice was less than I thought it would be.  Other than that, there wasn't much else I didn't like about this.  Anne Hathaway surprised and shocked me as Fantine.  I didn't know that the girl could sing.  She is the highlight in this movie.  The other young actors who are unknown were fantastic.  Eddie Redmayne who plays Marius and Samantha Barks who plays Eponine.  Moving picture that's about all I can say.
B00917IQFY|5.0|Yes,the chaps are a few years older than when they went their seperate ways.The album is in a slightly different direction than past work,but very well done.The band is on their second tour since releasing this album.Do yourself a favor by catching a live show.Much of this album is on the set list.As the band bonds again,their shows are getting tighter and you'll hear some older tunes that made them rock icons.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I feel like I just got off a rollercoaster! I was up and down with this book which just tells you that this book keeps you guessing and not sure where to turn and that makes a good book. I feel like I was there the whole time with America Singer herself. This book really made you question the people in this book, one moment you think you have the characters figured out and they go and shock you. This book really opened my eyes and it should open the others eyes about these characters. America is a strong and willful woman and she is stuck in a situation where she doesn't know where to step. She wants to be with Aspen but then she wants to be with Maxon. She figures out who she wants to be with finally and the rug gets pulled out from under her. People and things aren't how they appear in this book. In The Selection we got to meet different people and see different situations but we never got to the underlying things about these people or what was going on. But The Elite brought out more layers to the world we are viewing and the different characters and what is really going on. Now I have to wait another year to find out how it all ends, ah that sucks but if it takes a year for a work that lets us see even more deeper into this world and find out how it ends then I'll be waiting until it is here! Sometimes the second book is just a letdown but this isn't the case here, this book is so wonderful and refreshing.
0374214913|2.0|This book was mundane.  It had somewhat of a different approach creating a lukewarm mystery regarding a secret society looking for answers that ended up in front of their noses... A let down all around.
B005PK1G76|5.0|We attached this to our small stroller for our Disneyland trip. Two adults, 1.5 year old, 4 year old and 14 year old. So we needed a lot of cup holders because it was hot. This worked great. It held our smart water bottles and sippy cups. No issues with the bottles or cups falling out. Almost eveything fits.. even some large cups for soft drinks. We never took it off and use it all the time.

B00005N5S5|5.0|I bought this movie for about a dollar from cyberzoo, the disc was in excellent shape and played well. Ive been haunting the racks of a local movie store for this particular movie for the past 6 months with no luck. I absolutely loved the movie when it originally came out in the theatres, and up till now i never realized how cheezy the special effects are. Arnold looks like he has vasoline smeared on his face through half the movie, especially when he has a prosthetic on his face. All in all its a great movie and everyone should have this movie in their library.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|like shape & feel of this ear piece very light weight as for answering you can just  the speak & not have to touch the on button only problem is sometimes you have to say enter more than once when accepting call other wise very good feature also id's caller before accepting excellent feature don't have to take all from people you don't want to talk to people seem to be able to hear me better one this model verses others I have had like charging case great way to charge doesn't even have to be plugged in to charge  fits in purse easily. Would buy again.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I love solving the words and saving Hangman from being hanged :) it's funny and better than the other hangman apps. This one is animated into a cute cartoon animation. I LOVE IT. Buuuuut there is only one flaw!<br />It's a bit violent...<br />1st. A guy in a mask gives hangman a leg<br />2nd. Hangman kicks the man in the mask<br />3rd. The man in the mask gets revenge by hanging Hangman!<br />I don't think revenge is funny or cute.
0385349947|3.0|When I saw how much controversy surrounded this book, I couldn't wait to read it. A woman writing about women in the workplace and getting dragged across the coals - she must have really thrown something groundbreaking out there.<br /><br />But when I read it, I found absolutely nothing controversial. In fact, I was shocked to find out that other people were all riled up about it. The stuff in that book is stuff everyone should know all ready -- how women still aren't treated equally in the work force, how some of that is because we and others have been brainwashed, how some of that is because some people are just jerks, and how, ultimately, in order to change anything, *everyone* has to change, including ourselves.<br /><br />I've seen criticism that Sandberg \\"blames the victim\\". I think the majority of this sentiment comes from people reading articles about the book with information taken out of context. In the book itself, it's really just all about \\"Here are some tactics that can help improve things for everyone, given the current state of affairs. Give them a try.\\" Again, nothing groundbreaking at all.<br /><br />I've seen lots of criticism that Sandberg has lead a privileged life. I'm not sure how that's totally relevant to the book, as all the research and statistics she uses are valid regardless of her upbringing. And, as I keep saying, her advice is not *new*. So her backstory has nothing to do with that advice.<br /><br />Even if you already know all the things Sandberg covers, reading this book helps refresh and reinforce what you may need reminders of. If you feel you aren't really sure how to handle gender bias (and not just in the workplace), you may not have heard the advice Sandberg passes on. This book would be a good first foray into that area for you.<br /><br />It can be a little slow, a little redundant, and a little too anecdotal for my taste. But if you like the anecdote approach, you'll like this book.

B007CKNX28|5.0|I choose this rating because I received the product in a timely manner and in perfect condition.<br />Mr. White has real musical talent and I would consider genius in his field of expertise.  I am waiting for his next Music CD.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Historically...difficult to argue with Arthur Conan Doyle's fascinating exercise in tough crimes and their solution by Holmes and Dr. Baxter. Holmes personifies &#34;detail analysis and deduction&#34; at a superior level. The writing and story-telling is fast paced and brings the reader along on cab and hansom tours through late 1800s London and surrounding English countryside. A real treat for American veterans who spent part of WW ll in the UK. Mannerisms, language and personalities on view.
6305144176|5.0|This movie is funny, but exposes the painful truth about an unpopular war when America lost it's innocence and became divided. The story was based on a reality. The direction and the scenes are great. A real war and a real comedy. A difficult combination to portray. A fine addition to my video library! Classic Robin Williams comedy and drama all in one.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|For all ken Follett fans...do not bypass &#34;TRIPLE&#34;. Without question, an engrossing piece of professional writing with the pace and language command that has made Follett famous. As a senior-senior, I rate the book one of my all-time favorites for story quality.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is one that I regret missing the first time around. I was finally turned on to it by a friend, and have never looked back. Now I regret that Fox was ever managed by a bunch of numbskulls that cancelled a brilliant program. It is a drama, but with the right touch of humor. It is 'sci-fi', but not too fantastical. It is believable and watchable and incredibly engaging.<br /><br />I know I am likely in the minority, but now, so many years later, I don't think they could bring this series back. Part of the mythos is from the outrage against Fox for cancelling it, and the years it has lived and breathed in the fans' hearts and minds have given it a reputation that I doubt it could live up to if 'brought back'. Fox screwed up royally, but there's no way to fix it now. Now, we have to be satisfied that Joss Wheadon has shown all those naysayers that he was the horse to bet on, just as so many fans did, and that we all 'knew him when'.<br /><br />I'll just have to be content to think that Serenity is still out there in the black, making her runs, giving her crew a home, and that they are content with that home.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It was like the old Scarpetta books.  It was very easy reading.  Sometimes Patricia gets really detailed in the medical aspect of the morgan and what happens to the people.  This time I was really surprised by the outcome.  Usually I figure out who did it long before the end, this time not.
0143112724|4.0|Why shouldn't the most referred to book in my library have some nice artwork?<br /><br />We learn to write multiple times in our life. We may graduate college and never learn to communicate the ideas that we studied.  These rules, that once seemed ominous and stifling in grade school, now are dear friends that guide us toward clarity.  Visiting the rules again can stimulate a new found confidence of expression.<br /><br />A fresh look for this classic coincided with my need to communicate to a wider audience. While the illustrations don't add to the explanations, the book feels less judgmental. Maybe the added frill of the artwork reminds us that writing should not simply formulaic.  Keep this simple guide within arms reach.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|GOOD
0547848412|5.0|Top quality, fast delivery, great price. It is amazing how convenient it is to buy such worthwhile books, and, unlike a library book, you can keep these purchases for future reference and make notes right in your books.  And if you know a friend that has similar ideals/feelings, you can loan or give your copy away to them.
B000W93CHC|5.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth, I was doubtful this would be better. I was wrong. This was a great book. Highly recommend!
B000BKJ6WW|5.0|When I received this UMD disc I was elated. Pink Floyd are brilliant anyway and to have this on a disc that can go anywhere, fantastic.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderfully told story of a near death experience from the unique perspective of a neurosurgeon whose beliefs were transformed by his encounter with here/after. His perspective must be afforded substantial weight because of the transformation of his beliefs by empirical experience. His story rings true. No matter how you view the implications of his experience, the veracity of the telling of what he experienced, like other medical figures such as Brian Weiss, comes from the sense you derive from the telling that their transformed perspective were forced upon them by a voice demanding to be heard at this time in history. Read. Read with an open mind. Follow that voice.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Think it's a pretty interesting game and may need some work, and maybe the developers should try not enabling other players to be able to battle you with out you consenting and knowing and try a request feature or decline  feature  but overall it a very good game to play once you get into the flow of the game maybe revamp and rework the quality of some the free cards but its still a good game.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app has a nice selection of relaxation sounds. The only one I don't like is the white noise, which is looped in a choppy fashion. Otherwise, all the other noises are well done and soothing.
B0037UUZQY|4.0|I did not buy this off amazon I bought it at a toy store  I looked good in the package and when I took it out the hair was so greasy it was gross but the doll was ok
B0006L7U9M|5.0|This is a delightful movie. It is full of beautiful art direction and acting with a sly sense of humor!
B007QUUJMG|5.0|Recommend this book to adolescents especially those in high school. And those going through life struggles. Well done chbosky fantastic
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun and engaging game that seems simple but is challenging. I could \\"waste\\" way too much time on it! (But I'm working my brain, right? :o)
B0030DHPGQ|4.0|Read the book, attended a class that Chip gave and have been trying to implement the methodology. It works for many situations where change is both hard and critical for success.
B00422LESO|5.0|Loved it!!! Got lost and taken away!  Duped by Martin also. Loved Mr. Nobleys character and how he wasn't looking for love.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I didn't enjoy this book. Only the last chapters (the \\"reveal\\") saved me from giving this book a one-star review. The pacing of this story was incredibly poor, and the narrative was repetitive.<br /><br />Also I very much feel that if you are going to attempt Jane Austen's characters, you had better bring their A game. Gone was Elizabeth's witty insights and reflections - what a shame. Gone was the banter between her and Mr. Darcy (and everyone else). The other characters were dried up husks of themselves engaged in stilted dialogue. No character seemed to be engaged in any kind of inner struggle. I certainly hope that Ms. James doesn't believe that after people get married (the \\"happy ending\\") their personalities go right out the window.<br /><br />Lastly, the majority of the book turns on the fate of Mr. Wickham. Public enemy number one in Austen's book, his behavior is not much better here, yet the reader is asked to invest emotional energy in worrying about this fate for at least half the book. I'm sorry to say that this author does not give us a reason why we should care much one way or the other.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great feature to have as an app on my kindle. I use it all the time. I like the large buttons which make it easy to view.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|CableJive products aren't cheap, but I know I can count on whatever I buy from them. Like the other cables and connectors I've bought, this converter fits perfectly and works just like I need it to. Protective iPhone cases are great, but they are notorious for having small, hard-to-reach openings. I don't worry about that anymore since I found CableJive. They're pricey, but they're worth it.
1611138434|4.0|Sad but with lots of suspense. Interesting what an education a kid can have in a 11 x 11 sq. ft. room.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow. Just Wow. This book has all the elements to make a fantastic book, Kinda like making a food. Had lots of spices, Had a lot of details. This book was targeted at my feelings, Mostly for the deaths of Rue, Thresh, Cato. Rue's death and Thresh's had little detail. Cato's however was filled with intrest, Hope, and sadness, and sacrfice. Here is a little bit of advice. Don't read it at school, You won't be able to put it down for a second. It was that good! At first, At the first couple of pages you might think, I'm gonna hate... then later like at the reaping your like I'm Never Putting this down in my life It was that good
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi is, was and will always be cool.  This collection of recordings does not dissapoint and helps to keep his legacy going.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Trying not to give up! I wish I knew what to do &amp; how to advance! Can anyone help? I keep having to search for the same things over &amp; over again. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|The main character is witty, endearing, brave, and a bit self conscious...just like the rest of us! It’s a great coming of age comedy for teenagers and adults alike.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really enjoyed this game; it worked just fine on my kindle fire.  I appreciated having some harder puzzles to win and went back throuh after completing the &quot;80 days&quot; to get three stars on each level, giving it a bit more challenge.  I thought they did a great job with this app and recommend it!  :)
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This is a great movie definitely worth watching. It's got fantastic visuals that match a very fun and intriguing story.
B00A83075M|4.0|My six year old son enjoyed this movie. It hasn't become one that he watches over and over like his Scooby movies,but he likes it.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|It's a good movie, but it took me two nights to watch it because Instant Video would not load the second half. My internet connection was fine, and could load anything but videos from Amazon Instant Video. I connected my computer to a 52&#34; screen and the picture was great the first night, but the second night the picture was poor with a lot of pixelation.
B001JI5DRC|5.0|Great Movie!  My students loved it.  My students will be given a problem to solve based on the movie.  They will have to collaborate to be successful.
B009439HEY|5.0|First encountered Steve's work in '74, and his solo stuff not too long after that. Have seen him perform several times. Really, you can't go wrong. His style has meandered around over the years, covering a lot of territory, but it's good to go back and revisit old things and try them in different styles.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book yet. I can not wait for the movie for this book moved me so much. It pulled at my heart strings
B00A61F3PK|5.0|I forgot what a great record this is.  Almost every track is a hit, and a great song.  So glad we added this to our collection.
B00CAJDUX8|5.0|Loved every song right off the bat.  Only one song on here that I don't like - his collab with Miley Cyrus, only because she sounds like Miley Cyrus - Disney star - doesn't translate to hip hop.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie about two pals who get into some trouble and find a way to revolutionize the way of making a living is earned is heart warming and delightful.  Smart enough for adults, but endearing for children.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I liked the game but it started crashing and now it won't open at all. I'm about to delete. I might try it again later.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Brave is an adventurous movie that follows in the footsteps of \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\".  It has enough of action and heart warming events to appeal to adults and kids alike. If you are at all worried about if this is kid friendly enough for your little tyke, watch it first then let them watch it because you will want to watch it again.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|The game has great graphics. It is very addicting  sometimes i cant pull my self away. Get this game NOW.
1423140591|5.0|If you haven't read any of this series, think about it.  It is a great mixture of modern and Greek mythology.  Don't worry about how old you are; if you love tales of mythology, read these books!
B007Q53IQ0|3.0|Penelope Cruz is a gifted actor but the farcical plot of this film was a challenge to watch. Too many story lines which did not convince and for once, Ms Cruz's physical presence seemed to be over used to compensate for this. However, as with most of Pedro Almodavar's recent films, there was sufficient depth and intelligence in interactions/dialogue/maternal relationships to enjoy the parts rather than the whole. As always the cinematography was well executed. Not one, however, i would be drawn to watch again.
B0000029AL|5.0|Anyone who has read my other reviews knows how much I love debut albums. The first opportunity an artist has to define themselves--to make a statement about who they are and where they come from (their roots). Not usually where they are going, for an artist usually changes and evolves over the course of a career (not always for the better, in my opinion.)For this particular review, I will do things a little different. I will present this album song-by-song, and for those songs I think really stand out I will expound on, and for those I don't really care for--I simply write \\"filler\\" and move to the next. So here it goes.<br /><br />\\"Make It\\"--\\"Good evening people, welcome to the show\\", belts out Steve Tyler as he makes his grand entrance to the rock and roll world. The first words on the first song on the first album by Aerosmith--as memorable an opening line as the first words on the first song on the first album by Led Zeppelin, as Robert Plant spews out \\"In the days of my youth\\" on their classic opener, \\"Good Times Bad Times\\". Musically speaking, it is the most dated sounding song in Aerosmith's repetiore. A lot of people say that their most dated sounding song is \\"Spaced\\" from the second album, \\"Get Your Wings\\". I strongly disagree. Not only was this song, and this album, recorded on much more ancient equipment than \\"Get Your Wings\\", but the song itself features such choppy, mod-punk, Who-Kinks like guitar riffs from Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, forget 1973--this sounds like Aerosmith if they had existed in the 1960s! But it is one of my personal favorites because of it.<br /><br />\\"Somebody\\"--filler (next please)<br /><br />\\"Dream On\\"--What else can be said about this gem that hasn't already. The ultimate heavy rock power ballad, and one that should have been a hit in all of America when it was first released. About the smartest thing Aerosmith ever did was re-release this as a single 3 years later, knowing full well that with their new-found fame, America wouldembrace it..And they did! It should have been saved for last on the album though, instead of buried in the middle<br /><br />\\"One Way Street\\"--Not a style of song that Aerosmith would continue with later, but does contribute to their image of what was later described by the press as \\"New York's Heavy Metal Sound\\". Very urban sounding, with very urban lyrics--reminds me of taking a stroll through the tough streets of Brooklyn or Detroit on a cloudy day, saying \\"hello\\" to the hot dog vendors as I pass by.<br /><br />\\"Mama Kin\\"--Not one of my personal favorites, and a song I think is highly overrated compared to some of the other tracks here. But hey--Guns and Roses dug it!<br /><br />\\"Write Me a Letter\\"--filler (next please)<br /><br />\\"Movin' Out\\"--Amazing what a simple act of being kicked out of your pad would inspire such great lyrics and great guitar riffs! But this is one of my personal favorites from the album, the guitar riffs stick in my head for days!<br /><br />\\"Walkin' The Dog\\"--And speaking of guitar riffs, these are some of the best that Perry and Whitford ever came up with! I never got to hear the original of this song, but their rendition is truly killer and the lyrics fit Steve's style of singing so well, you almost think that they were his own! Also of note--Tyler's wood flute solo in the middle: I never thought you could add a wood flute to this kind of bump-and-grind rhythm and make it sound cool, but Stevie made it work.<br /><br />As a whole, the album sounds vastly different in production, because it was different in production. Whereas the Record Plant, where they would record some of their classic mid-period albums, was state-of-the-art with a state-of-the-art producer, Jack Douglas; this album sounded like it was recorded in a dingy warehouse with a dingy producer, namely Adrian Barber, famous for producing the Allman Brothers debut album with his \\"flip-the-switch-and-let-'em-bang-out-the-tunes-til-we-get-tired-and-fade-em-out\\"-style of production. But both albums bY Aerosmith and the Allmans have a certain charm about them because of that very raw, grimy production, with a style of music and lyrics to match!<br />One more point: Steve Tyler always said he never liked his vocals on this album. In my opinion, he never sounded better AFTER this album. Clean and clear, booming like a trumpet--far removed from the rasp he would develop on the next album. I think he had a very unique voice on this album--reminded me of a rock version of Robert Johnson to match the raw, blues-influenced rock presented here.
B0045ZAQSM|4.0|But very easy to watch. It had enough humour to remain engaging; even a few belly laughs such as the Skype encounter, the scene at the family funeral and how to fix a dodgy back-a scene not for the faint of heart. Overall, it was a birdbath of a feel good movie, where it was easy to see what was coming. Too full of beautiful people-but then did watch it after an episode of a Norwegian TV series where being ugly was an art form. \\"Soul Kitchen\\" has a tidy ending, great photography but falls over with a story dressed up as something anarchic-which it was not. Somewhere between a feel good-and guy-chick flick-still gave it a four because it works.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Clint Eastwood at his finest.  This is a great movie and a must see for any western film buff, or even an Eastwood fan.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|The casting was perfect in this movie.  The gentleman that they got to play &#34;Bones&#34; was great, as well as Kirk and Spock.

B004LP3AYI|1.0|I read Wizard's First Rule about 6 weeks ago.  I wanted to continue on with the series.  Of course I can't because even after 6 weeks, it's still not available.  I have no idea how long it has been unavailable.  There is a Feb 2013 review complaining about egregious errors.  I find it amazing that the powers to be can't spend a few hours editing and re-posting.<br /><br />A note to the author: If I can't buy your books, zero royalties coming your way.<br /><br />\\"Item Under Review<br /><br />This book is currently unavailable because there is an issue with its description, content, or formatting.<br /><br />We are working with the publisher to fix the issue.

B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is addicting just can't stop playing it u don't have to have neighbors but it is easy and fun to get them I like checking out all the dragons the neighbors have I recommend this game for young and old I am 61 and my sis is even older we live 1000 miles apart but this keeps us playing together
B003IHUHYG|1.0|Looked forward to seeing this movie.  Put it in our player, kept popping back out.  Our player would not play it.  Have had no problems with any other movies we have gotten.
B001NCR4OO|4.0|A lot of Zombie fanatics might think this is his worst record... but I like it quite well. I don't like it when and artist repeats songs and albums and stays safe. and John 5 is good; he's changes up his sounds and does some great acoustic work on here. only lacking thing on here is more vocal songs, although I enjoy the instrumenstruals excuse me instrumentals. and 1 less swingin track plus 1 or 2 more songs like the pounding \\"let it all bleed out\\" would have helped. but overall good and dark and diverse.
B00009R6BF|5.0|This flexible arm is perfect for raising the height of a camera above peoples heads when using a tripod.  While flexible it is rigid enough not to wobble when positioned.  I like it and it worked very well for taking pictures over a crowd.  Very good bang for the buck.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I was trying to view videos from another app that I had downloaded and was not able to because I don't have an Ipad or something that uses Itunes. I found this app and thought I would give it a shot, and it works great.  Now I can view whatever I want.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|This is a very &#34;fun&#34; group to hear.  Upbeat music with a hint of folk beginnings.  A good album to add to a collection.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|my daughter introduced me to Iz music and I finally found the CD I was looking for.  Love it. Thanks
B0081BU42O|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Iain M. Banks' Culture novels, and this was one of this best. I find with his books that they are interesting, engaging, and strong, right up until the last twenty pages, where a &#34;Chekov's Gun&#34; emerges from left-field and abruptly wraps up the action.<br /><br />This one was different - the ending was perfect and pretty much &#34;Whoa- what just happened!&#34;-free.<br /><br />I found that by giving the book a &#34;time limit&#34; in the form of the Gzilt's imminent sublimation, Banks was able to keep the ultimate conclusion within the limits of the rest of the action, while also raising the stakes of the Culture's usual intergalactic shenanigans, which can suffer, at times, from being either ineffectual against the vast forces of strangeness or overly prescribed (such as when they are dealing with civs of vastly inferior technology). Hydrogen Sonata presented the perfect challenge to the Culture's incessant meddling- themselves.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I collect DVDs of shows that I enjoy watching.  Although I received this later than Season 7, it was in good condition.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This is our favorite kid movie right now. We've seen it too many times to count and have shared it with family. It has some funny stuff for Mom and Dad and the kids love it too. It's fun to see classic childhood characters as tough protectors of all children.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|I have a huge bias when it comes to this film --- I've always adored the daring sense of flight and time-gone campy adventure this film so romantically portrays.  Prop plane?  Check.  Goggles?  Check.  Globe-trotting adventure?  Check.  This movie hits every high note that I could possibly want out of a bygone era flick, lovingly brought to life with turn of the century visual wizardry.  The creative team behind Sky Captain knew how to take my childhood dream (which was flying a biplane off into adventure) and somehow set its spirit directly onto film.  It's such a wonderfully campy movie, dripping with the cheese of 80's action films, the polish of 90's script-writing. and the visual CG punch of the early aughts.  Thankfully, romance is one of the few parts of the film that isn't quite so cheesy, with Joe (the titular Sky Captain) and Polly (the nosy but helpful news reporter) capturing the perfect sort of whimsically-begrudging-but-sincere relationship that works so well for these sorts of adventure flicks.  And of course, the science fiction elements really help push everything over the top, with the limitlessness of childish imagination (robots, laser guns, mad scientists! the works!)<br /><br />That all said, this film may not be for everyone, as the review aggregate seems to suggest --- I think it may take a particular sort of person to appreciate a film like this.  I personally grew up with a lot of old-fashioned TV shows, movies and cartoons when I was young (like Superman, Laurel and Hardy, Bewitched, I Love Lucy, Looney Toons, etc.), which might have helped me to better appreciate the throwback approach this film took.  I also traveled a lot as a kid (my father was in the military), and flying to/traveling around in different parts of the world really cultivated a love for the romance of worldly adventure and aviation that's captured in this movie.<br /><br />This film has so much of what I love in it, that I can't help but love it right back.  If you're afan of old-fashioned flight, adventure with a compass, and sci-fi futuristic robots and laser guns, you just might love it too.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|I watched this movie, but sheer luck on cable. I think it's pretty good directing and storyline is interesting. It just shows that marine snipers are very versatile soldiers through and through. I did find some aspects of the movie somewhat unrealistic, but ended up buying it. I think  it's a good group of actors.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I saw this movie and I loved it! It didn't really follow the book but I wasn't expecting it to by now people should not even bother complaining about that if it always happens. The movie was enjoyable and although there were some scenes that kinda dragged on the movie was good it wasn't as bad as people are saying.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this ebook as Christmas was gearing up (Nov 2012). I had never read it before and now I can say that I have.

B003YL4KS0|5.0|I had heard about this book for awhile, and I don't know why I waited so long to get it. I think the author does a great job of explaining the science behind hair care and gives excellent tips. She does come across as a little preachy at times, because clearly she has strong feelings about not damaging hair and keeping it naturally beautiful. The ebook version on my ipad is AWESOME. Instructional videos are interspersed in the text so that you can watch as you go seamlessly. Plus, having your reading interrupted by shower scenes is just fun...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this book!! I love it! It's so amazing I was surprise d it was over and very sad lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|in this game you take care of your own horse. you can change your destination too. also you can add excessories to ur person and horse. you can even buy more horses
B005HSL626|4.0|Cute game for all ages. Great for hand-eye coordination. Even people like me who are barely video-game literate can figure this out! Give it a try.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, and Tommy Lee Jones were the stars of this movie.  This film was unusual in that it really centered on Lincoln's efforts to pass the thirteenth amendment which freed the slaves.  Of course the terrible Civil War was the foremost challenge of his term, but most of this movie is how Lincoln and those close to him went about trying to garner votes for a very controversial amendment.  This is really the first time I've seen Lincoln in a different light.  He comes across as not the eloquent speaker of the Gettysburg Address, but most of the time he is seen as a bumpkin, using bad grammar, telling off color jokes, and really putting across a more human side rather than the larger than life image that we hear about.  Mostly he acted this way around his close advisors and his wife, Mary, and he never appeared shaken and that is probably why the jokes and stories.  It was to deflect from the terrible things that were going on around him.  Sally Field in her role as Mary Lincoln really captures her in looks, mannerisms, and is the long suffering depressed woman that we know.  Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stephens, the very passionate Congressman who supported Lincoln and the thirteenth amendment did a good job.  I almost didn't recognize him!  Of course, I feel that Daniel Day Lewis was very deserving of Best Actor.  He always seems to do character roles very well.  I'm mindful of Christy Brown(My Left Foot)and Hawkeye(Last Of The Mohicans).
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Really fun game ! You can build your own park with dinosaurs straight from the movie. Had trouble with it at first so I had to delete and reinstall the app. So far it has been working great.
B003UBTX72|4.0|I great up with this music and this book has provided a whole new dimension to Keith Richards and the Stones that I never knew about. I like their music so much more now because of Keith's in-depth descriptions of how he and Mick created some of the greatest rock tunes ever and the stories behind them.  You'll think completely different about most of their songs next time you hear them.  This is a really fun read
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is amazing, for starters. Works very well on original kindle fire. I honestly didn't even notice the ads at all when I got it because I was so focused on how well made the app is. You are able too see videos in the browser. You are even able too see videos not avalible on the mobile by using that function. Best app by far I have ever seen for youtube downloading/watching.<br /><br />  It gives you a neat little menu too avowing you all your downloads. The downloaded are avalible in al many forms. Even mp3 which you can rename to whatever you want. The downloads are super fast on top of all that.<br /><br />  My favorite part would be the function that allows you to switch to the browser. You can even log in and download your items on your playlists as an mp3 or video file.<br /><br />  On the browser portion of the app, your playlists can be played and you won't have to go back and click the next video.<br /><br />  Overall, great job Amazon. I am really impressed.

B0046MOV8U|4.0|The best part about seeing Beyonc&eacute; in concert is her legs. She is sexy from head to toe; the urban prototype of a beautiful woman; and you might be surprised how cute her face is with little or no make-up, but it's those legs that steal the show. And she knows it. So she wears skimpy outfits and exposes them to the world. Tina Turner, step aside. You're too old. That spotlight right there is for Sasha Fierce.<br /><br />The gay guys and most of the girls in the audience cheer her on for a different reason. They're real fans, like of her music. So when she struts her stuff; a pretty loud-mouthed Diva oozing with charisma; they scream louder. Sometimes they even pass-out; &agrave; la Michael Jackson. But, while his Halo dedication, featuring a childhood clip of Beyonc&eacute; about to go to his concert, is touching, her music simply can't compare.<br /><br />I like her first solo album; Dangerously In Love; so this set starts off pretty good to me. But most of the newer songs leave a lot to be desired. I generally need catchy vocals in order to sing along. So it's up to the visuals to entertain. And that they do, with quick edits and flashy stylizations. Say whatever you want about Beyonc&eacute;'s singing; I say she yells too much; you have to admit, she does put on quite a show.<br /><br />marcellee.com

B005LAIIHG|1.0|I would not recommend this Movie to anyone.  To me it was stupid and they call it a masterpiece.  A friend just took it<br />Waiting on her review.
B00936A0RU|3.0|The opening scenes of \\"Lawless,\\" John Hillcoat's fascinating 2012 work, are so intense they create anticipation the film does not live up to. Tom Hardy plays brother Forrest Bondurant, the formidable protector of a backwoods Virginia moonshine operation during the Prohibition. He has a face-off with a new sheriff of sorts, the preening Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) who has arrived by way of Chicago to collect toll. Hardy's stare is so intense it practically cracks the camera lens. After barely a pronounced word and the twitch of a brow, you know instantly his savage code is not to be underestimated. It's a spellbinding moment the film rarely matches.<br /><br />There's a great movie here, a sort of combination of [[ASIN:B00A8OWOSO Miller's Crossing [HD]]] and [[ASIN:B00498YZH8 Winter's Bone]], but somewhere on the muddy back roads it becomes lost in box office ambition. Based on the true story of the Bondurants, with a screenplay adapted by Nick Cave from Matt Bondurant's memoir [[ASIN:B001JQB0GC The Wettest County in the World: A Novel Based on a True Story]], filmmakers cast Shia LaBeouf as the youngest brother -- the runt of the litter -- and primarily focus on his attempts to live the code while courting the preacher's daughter. Such plot developments are as old as James Cagney's socks.<br /><br />LaBeouf is an acquired taste anyway, possessing boyish looks without the slightest menace. Hardy's presence, not to mention Jason Clarke as the fearless older brother Howard, completely swallow LaBeouf's sniveling portrayal. There's a primitive society here (check out the classic documentary [[ASIN:B000E5LEVU Harlan County, U.S.A. (The Criterion Collection)]]), and Hardy and Clarke capture the palpable nature of such blood cults. You need fingernail dirt, and LaBeouf has the presence of a kid folding jeans at The Gap.<br /><br />By way of Australia, Hillcoat has sparked an interesting career with [[ASIN:B002R1QQ9O The Proposition]] and [[ASIN:B003IWRE3I The Road]]. \\"Lawless\\" is a step back, though shows signs of considerable post-production tinkering. One suspects the film clocked at three-plus hours and Hillcoat had to whittle down to two. There's a musical montage that shows the Bondurants rolling in moonshine money while Pearce's Rakes destroys neighboring stills dotting the Virginia mountains. It's the moment the film unravels.<br /><br />\\"Lawless\\" introduces two fascinating characters, including Maggie Beauford, a dame with a past (Jessica Chastain), and gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman), but both are practically forgotten. Chastain especially deserves screen time, working the bar at the Bondurants' rural enterprise and capturing the wary eye of Forrest. There's an unforgettable scene when Chastain, sans clothes, slowly pats down a darkened hallway to his bed, ranking as one of the most haunting snapshots in recent memory. It's the type of image Jean Cocteau would admire ([[ASIN:B00007L4I6 Beauty and The Beast (The Criterion Collection)]]).<br /><br />Such moments in \\"Lawless\\" abound. It's a beautiful film, with the extraordinary cinematography of Benoit Delhomme, on-location filming in rural Georgia and brooding set designs creating a lamentable atmosphere. But the plot flow is too fragmented. You know there's going to be a showdown between Forrest and Sheriff Rakes, and they indeed meet next to a covered bridge surrounded by men toting rusty shotguns. By this point, the film has entirely lost its momentum, and it stumbles to an abrupt ending lacking the poetry Hillcoat was hoping for.<br /><br />Prior to \\"Lawless,\\" I had only seen Hardy in a few blockbuster epics ([[ASIN:B0047WJ12K Inception]]). His performance is a revelation, possessing the presence of mountains. It's a bitter sin we are forced to endure LaBeouf's preening. There's an interesting supporting character, a local handicapped youth named Cricket. Played by relative unknown Dane DeHaan, it's a striking portrait of tragedy. Wouldn't it have been interesting to switch DeHaan and LaBeouf? I'm just not convinced LaBeouf can evolve into the kind of leading man of action \\"Lawless\\" attempts to force-feed us. And when you have Hardy, Clarke, Chastain and Oldman standing in the background with the film's running time slowly ticking away, you know a great opportunity has been lost.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Having watched this movie at least 15 times, I still want to watch it again. The romantic twists and turns are absolutely delightful, and the honest and heartwarming emotions of the characters never fail to pull me along on their merry holiday ride. Can't wait to see it again, soon!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Had to take a break from this book. It could not hold my interest as the others did. Hoping the next one will have more substance
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun. I'm addicted. The only down side is that the game cut out on me a few times and took my credits.
B000ENV2PU|2.0|My review is more about the remastered CD than it is about the music on the album.<br /><br />The anti-piracy protection feature on this CD is terrible, causing it not to play in many modern devices (like the car stereo and computer). This anti-piracy feature robs you of the ability to simply listen to the music without jumping through security hoops. I have had bad experiences with these types of annoying and intrusive features. A few years ago, I had a SONY CD install a virus on my computer that ultimately caused the hard drive to crash. I read through the EULA to find that SONY would not be responsible for what they knew to be harmful to the computer and that it opened a serious hole in the PC's firewall to let in all kinds of malicious attacks.<br /><br />This kind of anit-piracy approach is wrong-headed because it takes away from the utility and usefulness of the CD. I was about to return the CD solely because of this inability to play. It took several attempts to upload the music to my mp3 library. Once I finally got it to play on the computer, the sound quality was not impressive at all; it is like the non-remastered CD. It does not sound any clearer, cleaner, or louder than the original release.<br /><br />In summary, bad remaster quality coupled with truly annoying anti-piracy software makes this CD Not Worth Buying.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app gives you all the info you need to plan your activities.The hourly forecasts are very accurate and presented in a easy to understand format. Highly recommended
B00000I2PG|5.0|As a long time ABC fan, I am still impressed at what a great album this was and still is. There are songs on this album that should have been included on the &#34;best of&#34; releases but were left off in favor of newer songs. This is one of ABC's very best albums and isn't very easy to find in music stores. Definitely a must-have for even the casual ABC fan.

B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|I was so happy when I learned Dido had a new album coming I pre ordered. She does not let you down. Love it all but I could do without the rapping parts the lyrics are good but maybe a feature artist could sing instead of rap
B000G1ALRK|5.0|This has been in heavy rotation in my cd player one of the best CD's I have had in a long time that I like a majority if not all songs on this record.
B004HW7JH4|1.0|While season 5 of Mad Men was pretty terrific, the DVD picture quality is absolutely awful.  Lionsgate should be ashamed of releasing such a subpar product.  The picture is very grainy, even on an HDTV.  Horrible horrible horrible.  A show this good deserves a higher quality DVD release.
B000056NX5|5.0|I was completely impressed with the staging and styling of this production.  Not exactly PG-13.  A modern and approachable production.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I think this is my favorite of the later Disney Classics.  I saw it when it first came out.  I bought the VHS and now I am happy to be able to buy this version.  Just love it!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is the best temple run ever I can't stop playing it. I also loved the new oz movie so that could heave something to do wit it also I I have every time run they have made I hope they make so.more different temple runs I love them
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I had been looking forward to watching this moving and it came as such a disappointment. First and foremost, the language was horrendous. It didn't really add to the story line so I really don't feel like it was necessary. There were parts of the movie that were funny and hilarious even, but we couldn't get past all the F bombs dropped by almost every character in the movie, even their 13 year old daughter.<br /><br />I am thankful we just rented it and didn't buy it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|T his is her best book yet! It moves very fast with lots of adventure. I liked it a lot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very addictive game.... If you love horses than you will like this apps a lot...<br />I also like the fact the you only get a few gems, makes the difficulty level a little higher...You get the option of buying them, but you miss the fan part...<br />I would recommend this app to my friends.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I recommend this book to any horror fan who loves to read horror novels. This book is a must read! Great scares and it truly delivers Stephen King never lets the reader down
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was my favorite out of the series. Great action sequences and some unexpected twists and turns. Now just to warn people, there is some extremely tragic things that happen. You really feel for Katniss and can relate to her mental and physical pain and trauma. I give this book the highest rating for all of the previous reasons. Pick up this book if you have read the others. You won't be disappointed!
B001TH16DI|4.0|I watched disc one last night, Star Trek the Motion Picture. The set up options for audio does not have options for 5.1 or DTS or even Dolby Digital. My old receiver apparently cannot decode the 7.1 on these discs so my sound falls back to PCM. Other than that the movie looked great.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Yep, I was surprized at the sheer size of this unit, even though I was aware of it's dimensions from previous research. I was sweating a bit until had this secured to my motherboard and inside my case.  My Corsair Vengeance case is roomy enough to give about a quarter inch clearance from top of cooler.  Be sure to have a long Phillips screwdriver handy for securing the screws on the chip-side of the mounting bracket.  Any attached fan will have to be removed to expose the slots along the radiator fins to allow for proper alignment.  The instructions were a bit vague on this point.  Also, I had to forgo a RAM-side radiator fan due to lack of clearance on my Corsair Vengeance memory heat spreaders.  Be aware of the dimensions on this cooler when considering the components and layout of your system, both vertical and horizontal. Otherwise, this cooler does a great job keeping CPU temps under control and I highly recommend it, even for moderate overclocking.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|I walked into my local record store and this was playing.  I asked the lady who is this?  \\"Kurt Vile\\" she responds...hmmmmmm never heard of him.  But I took a chance and picked up the CD.  So glad I did.  I can listen to this album all the way through without skipping any songs.  Very dreamy and kinda bluesy and folk all wrapped into one.  Nice work Kurt!
B005LAII1C|5.0|We watched the movie in the theaters twice and just knew we should have it in the home.  Dry & sarcastic sense of humor.  I would not recommend for a younger audience.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|good time killer use up the free lives go do something else pick it up later plenty of other time wasters out there
B00BG08FKK|5.0|After watching the movie, we (as a family) loved the music and the emotions it conveyed.  I highly recommend to everyone who fell in love with Les Mis.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I wish you could press more than 2 keys at a time, and the songs are limited... but overall a great game! :)
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|Like eating syrup covered pancakes - with your hands. I know it is not new, but I just bought it and I love it.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Great insights, while most of it is seemingly obvious, this book makes it clear how smart IT folks can miss the mark while in the throes of IT firefighting. Great read.
B00AMS38YU|3.0|Actually, the movie's pretty bad: the villain's certainly a jerk, but nothing to write home about.  The hero, Wilee (what kind of a name is that, anyhow?) checks his text messages while on the bike--an accident waiting to happen in New York traffic.  Being a bike geek who actually does ride a fixed-gear bike in traffic pretty often (albeit in downtown Boston), I know I'd get killed trying to do half the stuff Wilee pulls.  And the \\"fixed-gear versus gears\\" rivalry between two messengers is nothing new; Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne were there first in \\"Quicksilver.\\"  The chase scene in Central Park is pretty realistic, however.  I've occasionally cut corners, had to jump a curb or two, or cut across grass--just not while racing someone.<br /><br />So to sum up--not a good movie, but fun to watch because I'm a bicycle nerd.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Photography and visual effects were outstanding. I am glad this was in 3D, because the actual story was not to my taste.
B001NN4162|5.0|i recommend this to any one who wants good blu ray movies love the quality on this blu ray  thanks
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|It was an excellent movie and the sound track was everything I expected.  I listen to it and remind myself of when I lived in Hawaii.

B000V63B90|5.0|OK, let's readily admit that not all of us were fans of 80's pop music. I, for one, suffered through the 80's latching onto the very rare glimpses of creativity that it managed to spawn. (Thank goodness Ska and Punk saved at least some of it) Syncopated drum beats, bad clothes, REALLY bad hair, over production, \\"Logo Bands\\" and throw away dance songs. However, Lexicon of Love is a standout and MAY BE the quintessential 80's pop album. (Not counting \\"Thriller\\" which will always be in a league all its own.) Just as other albums define an era or a type of music, such as Led Zeppelin II defining power rock/blues, Dark Side of the Moon defining 70's progressive music and The Allman Bothers first album defining southern rock; (Personal opinion not fact. So lay off any criticism!) Lexicon defines the excesses and pop music dance beat of the 80's. (I am not saying LOL is as good as these albums either. I am just saying it well represents this era of music.)<br /><br />I must readily admit that I thoroughly enjoy every second of the album. Generally, once I put it on I have to listen to it start to finish. I get hooked and simply can't turn it off. This album is no sleeper. There are no slow ballads. ABC wanted to get you moving and keep you moving throughout the entire album.<br />The song arrangement of the album is darn near perfect. Every song on LOL blends seamlessly into the next. Some are bridged with very short orchestral movements only to break into another drum beat to pull you into the next song. Being a fan of progressive music, this could be why I like this album. It is \\"almost\\" constructed as one continuous piece of music. Each song is catchy with great hooks, a steady beat and fantastic tongue in cheek lyrics. \\"Like the phoenix rising up from the ashes, I know what's good but I know what trash is!\\"  \\"No rhythm in cymbals, no tempo in drums, love on arrival, she comes when she comes.\\" The albums sound is dated; you can tell it is 80's pop within the first 30 seconds so you probably can't put forth the argument that it is \\"timeless\\". But for what it is, pure 80's pop/dance, you are not going to get much better.<br /><br />Martin Fry's voice is along the same lines as Bryan Ferry's with a nice smoky quality, good range, and so much feeling. One might even put forth the argument that ABC was Roxie Music wanna be's. Their music is definitely in the same style although a bit more \\"lush\\" than RM. Where Roxie Music eventually became known for several stellar musicians (I.e. Phil Manzanera, Brian Eno, Andy Mackay, Eddie Jobson to name but a few) I doubt you could say the same for ABC. (However, Roxie Music's original drummer and bass player did end up on ABC's second album \\"Beauty Stab\\".) But, they were good at what they did. They were a good cohesive group. This could be what hurt them. They could never match the success of this LP and just didn't seem to want to stay in this same genre. They tried on their second LP \\"Beauty Stab\\" to be more guitar based and it failed miserably. Which really puzzles me because it is a more creative album and showed off a very talented band. It was as equally energetic as LOL but did move away from dance, which may have allienated their fan base a bit too soon. \\"Beauty Stab\\" is a solid 4 star album with a much stronger new wave and rock beat. While not quite as good, I think it may hold up a bit better then LOL by not sounding quite as dated some 30 years later.<br /><br />It will be difficult to find a bad review of this album. From its onset it was well received. It went straight to the top of the UK charts and still shows up on the list of the top 100 British albums. Not bad for what many consider throw away 80's dance music.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|Worked great for less. Check out a video I shot with it for a competition entry. Let me know what you think[[ASIN:B007FDE4Y8 Opteka SteadyVid PRO Video Stabilizer System for Digital Cameras, Camcorders and DSLR's]]:<br /><br />[...]
B005KAH7QU|4.0|This was a good movie. The end kinda sucked but the action was good. It sort of reminded me of a low budget film to an extent.  It was a hard movie to find. It was not in stores or at the Red Box so I rented it from Amazon. Great way to view movies. The movie was entertaining. Just watch it with no real expectations.
B002O2THRO|3.0|Could have been made in 90 minutes with crisp storytelling. Extra star for period costumes and pieces which gave roaring twenties beauty and flair.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I like this book really inspiring and wonderful I want to read more of his books and hope there as amazing as this one
1576754227|5.0|This is not only a very interesting approach, but it really works!! It is both practical and  fairly simple as well.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|This album gets ignored with the success of Fun.'s second one, but I like it at least as much if not more.
